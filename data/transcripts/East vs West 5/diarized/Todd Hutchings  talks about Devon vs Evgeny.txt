Engin Terzi: Hello Todd. Hello. How are you my friend? I saw you early so I just didn't want to make you wait but if you want we can start later if you're busy. I'm ready to go when you are. Okay then let's go. How have you been? I'm doing well. I had a big practice two weekends ago and I had a big practice yesterday so
Todd Hutchings: I am definitely feeling like I've had a lot of birthdays. Okay. So you have been trading? Yep. And did you take any breaks? I took all of September and the first half of October off. Okay. So do you feel you recovered? You are recovered? No, no, no. It'll be a while, but I feel like I will get there, but I'm not there yet.
Engin Terzi: No, no. I mean, the pain, pain are away. Oh, yeah. Yeah. For the most part, pain's gone. Okay. So that's the most important because if you want to push yourself again, you want to be healed up and then again. Yeah. Do you feel absolutely yourself like when you are like fully resting? Do you feel the pain is going away or when you train light and blood pump and then that you feel better?
Todd Hutchings: if i stop completely and rest i tend to feel uh stiff yeah and i think that leads to soreness because i think i lose flexibility and mobility and i think i create soreness just because um yeah so i feel a lot better if i'm active and if i'm eating better so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i understand um just just to say let me get something hot and nothing
Engin Terzi: i got cold and yeah anyway i got a cold too i've had a cold for a couple of days yeah yeah yeah yeah and what have you got kovic during the pandemic a second you got you got kovic during during the pandemic like no i didn't get covered oh really wow
Todd Hutchings: already i don't know i got twice oh well i might have had it before everybody else did because it started in america in california like around january before anybody really knew and i was in california in january so i might have caught it before it was uh famous oh okay maybe your immune system is good and then you didn't really
Engin Terzi: feel so terribly experienced so terribly right i understand yeah anyway so so you go in germany next month yeah i mean december yep december 9th december 9th okay yeah and then then january east versus west hopefully yep that's good that's good have you been have you been following
Engin Terzi: what's going on with Prudnik and Devon? A little bit. I don't watch everything, but I saw a little bit here and there. And of course, people tell me so. Yeah. I'm personally very curious about that. Very curious because you know Devon closely and you know Prudnik, you put with him.
Engin Terzi: And whenever I asked Matt Mask, who also had a match with Prudnik, he said that Devon would beat him, but at 115 kg, which is 253 pounds, he would slightly favor Prudnik. This is what he says. So I would like to, whenever you train with Devon, you had a super match with two guys back to back and
Engin Terzi: And yeah, and Devon was in incredible shape. He was getting ready for Levan. So, but if you just consider that, just for example, maybe in January they will pull, maybe in Istanbul in 19 days, it's still not clear. I really don't know because Devon is very, how to say, hard to understand him. And I talked with him. I don't understand what he's saying.
Engin Terzi: so if he pulls in november he is basically doing his daily thing going there training then not not a special preparation for pruning while britney was ready or already for michael so what what do you think the possibility is if they pull in january or if they pull in uh istanbul in 19 days how do you see in both cases if they pull in january
Todd Hutchings: I think Devon's the favorite to win that match, but only because Devon's, you know, a unique enough puller, I would still favor Prudnik on a rematch. I think of, cause I, you know, well, Prudnik's practiced with Devon now, so it might be equaled up, but I think Devon, I think Devon has an advantage on their first match when they first meet. But I think Prudnik will be able to overcome and win.
Todd Hutchings: the rematch. Now, if they pull in November, Devon's advantage over Prudnik is even smaller, you know, because if they pull the 19 days, I think Devon still goes in as the favorite, but he's not a huge favorite as if he would if he goes in in January. Well, you are saying that in January, he would be a huge favorite, not slightly favorite. I think he would be a very large favorite in January.
Todd Hutchings: He'll have time to get the weight right, accommodate for it, and train. If he goes in in November, I think he's got an advantage just because of his abilities and experience. But in both cases, I think Prudnik will learn what he needs to learn, come back with something different, and I think Prudnik would be the...
Todd Hutchings: the favorite on the next match. Justin like it took Devon a couple of tries to figure out Michael Todd, I think it might take Prudnik a few, a try or two to figure out Devon. Yeah, but what makes you think that Prudnik will learn more than Devon will learn from their match? Because I think, I think Prudnik is more versatile than Devon.
Todd Hutchings: i think i think devon's a very versatile arm wrestler but i think prudnik's probably a step up in that and i think prudnik will uh he'll be able to adapt his more conventional training style quicker than what i think uh devon could yeah but just just think this way you are saying that devon will be a huge favorite in january and if somehow there will be prudnik
Engin Terzi: in November 19, if he comes, and with the more preparation, would you still see Prudnik favored for the revenge match? Like if Devon wins, even in such case, do you think that with a specific preparation, it will be even more dangerous, Prudnik? Do you think there is a possibility like that as well?
Todd Hutchings: Yeah, I think Prudnik wins the revenge match. I think, I think their power might be close or Brutnik's probably even has more power. What's tricky with Devon is he's a little unorthodox and his hand is really, really good. And Prudnik's hand is really, really good. I just think Prudnik is more comfortable transitioning than what Devon would be. And I think, and
Todd Hutchings: the two of them mentally getting each other's case and it's gonna be fun to watch either way you know uh but i'm telling you prudnik prudnik feels like something else to me he feels like something special simple yeah yeah i agree i agree and and the question is what will rudnick learn in your opinion
Engin Terzi: I think he will. If you were Prudnik, what would you learn? Because it looks like you have experience with Devon. You to have the tools or not to have the tools to apply what you learn is a different story. But if you had the tools to beat Devon, what would you learn? What would you know to beat him? I think what Prudnik's going to learn, if you look at Devon's match with John,
Todd Hutchings: john you know uh john just got super frustrated with the way devin was controlling that whole front side of the match um i think i don't think prudnik's had that level of trolling on him yet because prudnik's you know always widely the favorite going into a match this would be one of the first times that prudnik goes in not a clear favorite so i think prudnik's gonna have to learn to deal with that uh
Todd Hutchings: I think Prudnik's going to have to learn to deal with Devon's otherworldly endurance. Devon's not scared to try some crazy stuff that nobody's ever seen before. What do you mean? Well, pumpkin training and all this. His training on how he prepared for LeVon or how he
Todd Hutchings: got really, really big to pull Michael Todd and then just basically shut his hand down. I mean, it's all, you know, you never really know what's happening with Devon. He always comes up with this a little bit different. So, but yeah, I still think Devon's the favorite in the first match, the first super match. Another question. Um, how do you see Brittany beating Devon specifically? Faster. Which way? I see him, uh,
Todd Hutchings: um probably fast in a hook like like like getting inside fast and going sideways without the step with step it's hard to say
Todd Hutchings: i think devin prefers the strap and i think prudnik would be fine with it but i think prudnik will hit hard and fast enough that if devin slips it's it's it's close to a losing position i think that i think prudnik's got substantially more speed or power than devin does um but it'll in all likelihood if devin wants it in the strap it'll be in the strap pretty much every time i mean like the rules that if you remember we said as long as it is not like
Engin Terzi: pin level, parallel pin or something. Any sleep, we said strap, as long as your elbow is on the pad. So I think it will be easier for Devon to sleep, but we will see. I mean, you managed to go to sleep with Prudnik around three. Yeah. Yeah, like I said, if Devon wants it in the straps, it'll be in the strap every time, I'm pretty sure. So he would manage to sleep, yeah. Yeah. I understand.
Todd Hutchings: how about how about you know that one also is that uh shoulder pressure mixed hook um do you think there is any possibility like that if he enters a match um it'll be harder on prudnik because he's taller you know that that works really well if there's a big height difference and prudnik's hand i think is good enough if prudnik thinks it's coming
Todd Hutchings: i think you'll get devin's hand far enough outside where you can't get that where devin can't get his shoulder in line with it so um i mean that's that's an effective move but it's it's way more effective if you are substantially taller than the other guy or if you have quite a bit more power minimum minimum 10 something taller like minimum four inches taller than prudny yeah but that ain't that ain't too much i i mean
Todd Hutchings: and diving inside on prudnik i don't know if that's well that'll be interesting to see because prudnik's pretty comfortable inside yeah you know and uh that looks like i'm gonna be really interested to see how good prudnik's hand is compared to devin's ground two you caught him somewhere but you got fouled yeah you stop him it uh
Engin Terzi: When you got a height difference, it's easy for, if there's a height or a weight difference, it's very easy for the other guy to push you off your pad, you know? I understand. And, and like, we can easily say that these two are two, like all the smartest with a very high, like table IQ. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: very well-rounded, very technical, very smart. I mean, it is, there will be a lot of like, how say, like a chess game there. The IQ level will be off the roof, you know, like, do you agree with that? I absolutely agree with that. It's, I'm very excited to see this match. Prudnik is, Prudnik's probably the closest thing to a second John is there could be a second John. I agree. I agree. I agree. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but let's see, let's see how, how it will be because I think, I don't think that Prudnik has ever met someone like Devon. I agree. I don't think Prudnik's ever gone in. Like that is the reason that you are saying that he's going to lose the first time when they meet. Yeah.
Todd Hutchings: I also don't think Devon will take a match unless he's a clear favorite. You know what I'm saying? What's that? So you are saying that he's not coming on November or you think that he wouldn't take the match if he didn't believe that he's going to beat him? If Devon's not 95% sure he's going to beat Prudnik, he won't take the November match, but he will be that confident by January. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.
Todd Hutchings: So, but still, you know, being practiced. So Devon's got an idea of what Prudnik's like, because I saw a video of them practicing not too long ago. After you pulled Prudnik, did you think that he would beat Devon in the same way? It's hard for me to judge because both those guys beat me pretty substantially, but they both felt
Todd Hutchings: equal levels, but in different ways. I mean, there there's that when you grab somebody who's clearly an elite arm wrestler, you'd know. And, uh, I was, I'm, I'm highly impressed with both of them. So yeah, that's definitely a good match. Bruton versus Devon is, is definitely a good match to what, even if the score comes out five, zero, it don't mean they're far apart. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um,
Todd Hutchings: So basically you are saying that Brutnik needs to be fast. It means that Brutnik either will win fast or he's going to lose the match. I think Brutnik's easiest path to win is fast. I think they've got, I would give the endurance advantage to Devon, but I don't think Brutnik's going to get tied up and locked in place. I just think that Brutnik's definitely faster than Devon.
Engin Terzi: And I think Devon likely has more endurance than Prudnik. I don't know. I mean, I've seen Prudnik pull a lot of long matches, but never against big people. Oh, no. There is no human being on this earth like Devon. I'm convinced. He would know better. You pull him. But in my opinion, there is no human being about the endurance like this guy. I don't think that any match which is very close
Engin Terzi: can be won by his opponent i don't think so rudnick may win a match which is not a flash pin but only if he has very good advantage position not in an equal position i don't think he can beat him that way yeah but you gotta remember yeah remember prudnik was preparing for michael todd and michael todd has a lot of long matches so i think prudnik was already prepping for a long match
Engin Terzi: But long match against Michael and long match against Devon is different because whenever you pull with Michael, sometimes he loses his wrist. It is possible to climb up. But whenever you play the game, outside game with Devon, his hand is usually more solid than his opponent. Like even round one, if you remember, when Devon went fully outside, his wrist was like this. Devon's wrist was like this too.
Engin Terzi: lebanon also lose his wrist he came barely to the pet level barely and then lebanon realized that the second round he went more still with pronation but more sideways he went like compared to do that fully outside move so even if if levan had that kind of problem it means that that one is very solid wrist and you know when you go
Engin Terzi: like wrist to wrist, you know, back pressure to back pressure. It is not that easy to, well, against Michael, he also takes your wrist, but I have seen some people climbing up over Michael's hand, but I don't remember if the matches stopped, people are going up over Devon's hand, you know, so that's my opinion. Also, Gennady versus Devon would be a very good match, because I think Gennady also has very good endurance when the match is
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Gennady doesn't like those dominating power guys, you understand? Like Jerry, incredibly horsepower. Dave, incredibly horsepower, you understand? But Devon is not like that. Devon is also, you know, the chess player. And Gennady is the same way. I think it would be an incredible match. Because when Gennady also equals the match, you know, he is also very good. I don't know. We will see. We will see how the matches will be.
Engin Terzi: Let's see if Devon, because he's confusing me with the videos he's sharing. So I don't know if he's coming or not. You think he will come or not? I don't have a clue what he's thinking. I don't know. I could be sitting next to him and still not know what he's thinking. So yeah, I can't help you there. Yeah, that's what I feel. People are thinking that I should be knowing this already.
Engin Terzi: And because, like, I'm in communication with him. No, it's not. He's just talking. So I don't know how you call it in English, you know, you know, the philosophy of this, how do you call it? He's obfuscating. Anyway, so whatever. So let's let's see how it will be. And how were you seeing Michael versus Devon? Michael Todd versus Devon? Prudnik versus Michael. Sorry.
Engin Terzi: I think Prudnik was a clear favorite against Michael. I understand. I understand. Yeah. Anyway, so let's see. Let's see how it will be. So what do you think about the other matches? Let's start with Dave Chaffee versus Ermes Gasparini. Do you think the first question... First question. Do you think that... Do you think that
Engin Terzi: Do you think that Jerry or Dave is a harder match for Ermes Gasparini? Do you think Chaffee or who? See, Jerry Cadoret, Jerry Cadoret get injured. So he's out. But now Dave Chaffee replaced him. Do you think that Jerry was a harder match than Dave Chaffee match or Dave Chaffee is a harder opponent for Prudnik than Jerry? So this is like...
Todd Hutchings: I think Dave is a harder opponent for Ermes than Jerry would be myself. And I ranked the seven matches I can talk about, which all have West people in them. Ermes versus Dave Chaffee is my second most confident match. The thing with Dave, Dave runs hot and cold. Dave and Ermes is my second most confident.
Engin Terzi: most i couldn't sorry about it most hyped except my confidence in my prediction oh okay sorry sorry sorry about it sorry for my limited english you know yeah yeah sorry yeah no that's all right um dave runs hot and cold and you know sometimes he's a monster and sometimes he just loses these frustrating matches but what i saw
Todd Hutchings: they do with vitality i like dave's chances against armies i mean hermes is really really fast but dave can deal with fast stuff so um yeah and i think dave is going to be a more complicated uh opponent for hermes than what jerry would have been see this is they've been like harder opponents than jerry is one thing and dave's chance against hermes
Todd Hutchings: is another thing so what's his chance you think he's gonna be well i'm going to predict the west wins all these matches i'm just going to tell you what they need to do to win okay yeah yeah if uh dave as long as dave prepares for herbie's speed and uh can catch that match i i like dave's horsepower over herbie so as long as dave's been hitting the weights really really hard and
Engin Terzi: Um, just, just pulling Ermes like he did Vitality. I like Dave's chances. How do you see that? Like 55, 45, barely, or like a clear, like favorite or? Um, I'll go 60, 40. 60, 40. So you are saying that Dave should win that match. You are, this is what you are saying. I believe Dave wins that match. I understand. Yeah. And this is, this is.
Engin Terzi: the second match that you are most confident about your prediction. This is the second match. Okay. What was the match that you are most confident? John versus Oleg. And you are saying that John is going to beat him for sure. Yep. I think Oleg will test John's hand. Um,
Todd Hutchings: Oleg pulls very similar to what John does with that knuckles high. I just think John's a chameleon, and I think John will figure something out. I think lately John's been pulling a lot of long matches and having to fight hard for it. But I think John went back after the Unkabayev match and got his head right, and I like John's chances against Oleg. I'm most confident about John and Oleg. That's probably a 70-30.
Engin Terzi: wow um question have you been talking with john lately any phone talk how does he feel anything no no okay nothing recent okay okay so you are but you did you see petrinko's interview i did not i was watching oleg's um videos of him
Todd Hutchings: and there's not like the videos i saw of him i think the the most recent match i saw of his was from the 2019 zloty and some some fairly older videos there's a lot of training and a lot of interviews and a lot of talk and a lot of practice arm wrestling but i was just looking for competition matches you want me to you want me to give you some more information about him sure absolutely the the information at the zloty tour he was 209
Engin Terzi: Right here, he will be 230 pounds. And another thing, according to his own words, you know, he's 30% stronger than with the weights that he's lifting, then he's low to shape. This is what he says. And he says, the new era started for armwrestling. And he says that East versus West is the evidence of this. And
Todd Hutchings: So we will see if there is new era or John is going to teach him something that he never experienced. I think he's right that there is a new era. I mean, I think arm wrestling has changed some and you're starting to see a different style of arm wrestling now come out, but.
Todd Hutchings: You know, that's talking on a macro level. That's the whole population of arm wrestlers. John is still a singular event. You can always have an exception to the rule. Yeah, but Todd, just think about like 10 years ago, think about Rustem Babaev, think about Arsene Lilliev. I mean, like, can you say that athletes today is just much better than those athletes at that time? No, I think Rustem and Arsene are,
Engin Terzi: are examples of but they were kind of rare at the time i think you're seeing more and more arm wrestlers like rustam and arson arson yeah at that time there was also turbin remember in the top eight that you competed with like other guys krasimir you and some others so i'm just trying to say that
Engin Terzi: Like in every decade, you know, there are some great, even today, yeah, there are, you are right. There are more of the great art masters. Numbers are more. But like, if you compare the best from 10 years ago and best from today, you cannot say that today's best for sure would be the best 10 years ago, you know? No, no, no. I'm not saying that. I'm saying when John was in his heyday, John was all by himself.
Todd Hutchings: yeah right then a couple of years later you've got some real uh significant elite athletes where we can put uh rustle parson zoloft in that group i just think that about the high level the number of arm wrestlers at a very high level is getting more and more instead of it just being john by himself i think dozens of it
Engin Terzi: yeah but john by being by himself still you know if you would just bring here 2006 vegas john i mean he would just sorry but drill all of them you know the one that you were there in vegas you were not there right 2006 when he beat perry travis and all of them that day you were there uh 2000 no i didn't start arm wrestling i i was not there but i was arm wrestling
Engin Terzi: no no year before you beat john front of me in 2005. so i'm saying the year after the 2006 vegas i mean that year the john i mean forget about the guys from his weight category now
Engin Terzi: I don't know, except Levan, I don't know how many human being in the history could beat John. Yeah, he was incredible. I mean, we can't compare John, 58 years old, with all the shoulder injury, less signal going in his hand. I mean, he is not that John John. So beating him today is great, but doesn't prove a lot. Agreed. I agree with you. OK, so you are saying
Todd Hutchings: they uh dave is beating hermes and can i ask you something how much patriotic feelings are getting involved with your predictions oh all of them i'm only going to pick i only want to talk about seven matches where the west wins the seven matches that the west involved and i'll tell you what they have to do to win that's all i don't want to pretend to be unbiased or fair because
Engin Terzi: I just ain't. So I'm going to tell you, if I was the coach for the West, I will tell you what I would tell these guys to win. You are not looking with an objective eyes, but you are looking at the subject as a patriotic American. Correct. OK, yeah. OK, tell us. I think everybody does. I'm just going to be honest and tell you. Of course, there is nothing more normal than this one. I mean, the opposite way would be not normal, you know.
Engin Terzi: okay tell tell us how john beats you already told right you said that yeah he will yeah he will find a way and he will he knows how to pull long matches in a rugby position both of them like the way that he pulled those some matches with chan show and then people with what's the tall guy's name i forgot from texas the he was russian or ukrainian oh
Engin Terzi: i know the guy i know the match i can't remember his name yeah yeah yeah so you are saying that yeah even john is in this position he is more used to pulling that way than probably petrenko is and then and petrenko is the student of andrei pushkar rest in peace yes he is he's famous for that that's i i saw are you gonna tell us how dave is gonna beat hermes or uh you already said about it i think hermes is going to
Todd Hutchings: hit what he normally does. And I think Dave's going to cut that hand and drag them back. And Dave's got like two or three really good hits every match. So the Furbies can survive Dave's hit for the third time. Burmese is a good shape. The problem is, is that. It's hard to survive that three times. You know, I understand. I understand.
Engin Terzi: Do you think that many people are thinking that the first round is going to go to Dave Chaffee because he's incredibly strong in a fresh match while Ermes is also very explosive. How do you see the round one exactly? Who's going to pass the center? I don't know because the first round is they both walk up with their plan. They don't know. And when they first grip, I don't think they've ever pulled each other. So there's going to be a lot of
Todd Hutchings: those that, you know, they'll fight for the grip. They'll see Dave win the first match likely, but I, I mean, I'm still 60, 40 on that, you know, just overall. I mean, to me, I think Dave's got a 60, 40 chance that every match. So, yeah, this is, this is what you are saying is like prediction, but you said you were the coach of American team. We didn't see anything. You're telling us that like Dave should do this. They should do that. Did you say, or I miss it?
Todd Hutchings: Oh, no, I didn't say I don't think Dave and Ernie's are going to see. Yeah, I don't think you're going to see anything drastically different from either one of those guys that you haven't seen before. I think they're going to be pretty much one dimensional. And if they try something else, unless Dave pulls out that inside press again, you know, I don't think you're going to see they're they're not.
Engin Terzi: They're not Drew Nick and Devon where they got like a thousand tools. You know what I'm saying? They got one hammer and they got one little screwdriver. They're not, you know, Drew Nick has got a hundred tools in his box. So you are saying that all they will do is what we already know what they can do. And then the result will be like that. No need to be a special coaching for any of them. Their way is
Engin Terzi: known and then according to you you think that they will be stronger and will win and there is no need to coach john as well so this is probably right no need to tell john what to do and and then okay how about the other matches match number three is matt mask and sandras oh yeah i think that's going to be a lot like the hermes and i think they're both going to do the same thing over and over again um
Todd Hutchings: What do you mean? I think, uh, Matt needs to pull more backwards instead of straight sideways. Cause I think Sandris says, uh, a little bit better with his hand wise. So Matt just keeps hitting straight, straight to the other peg. I think he'd be in trouble. So if he can hit more backwards, um, I think that would be the advantage. I think that's what Matt has to do to beat Sandris. So you are saying that he needs to get the position first and then go for the beat.
Todd Hutchings: Well, Matt's hit is just, I don't even know if he has, but I mean, he hits and then he collects position on the way down. It's just that Matt's hit is so sideways where I think they'll be in the straps. And I think if Matt hit more towards his corner of the pad, then start straight towards the peg, anything to get Sandris's hand away from his body a little bit.
Engin Terzi: because i don't think matt has sucked up the height that that hitting peg to peg works if you got a big hand height advantage but sandras is fairly tall in and of himself so yeah both are about the same 195 centimeter 197 centimeter maybe matt is maybe one inch taller than him yeah so you are you are as a team of the coach of the team west you would tell him
Engin Terzi: take him to your side of the table then go for the pin exactly because you are saying that the straight from start position to the side way you are saying the sundries may be stronger
Todd Hutchings: I think Sandris is a little bit more versatile than Matt. So if you go straight sideways, I think Matt could find himself tied up in a hook and he doesn't want that. Oh yeah. I understand. Yeah. Matt wants his knuckles high and he wants, Matt does not want to cross center or go anywhere near the center of the table. Cause Matt's not going to pull out a press in the middle of this match and Matt's not going to hook anybody. You know, he's going to rely on speed and explosiveness and he's got to get it
Todd Hutchings: wake on backwards you know he just he's got to prevent sandras from catching him um the question i have seen you pulling matt he toppled your wrist but you beat him with the deadrest and do you think there is a possibility that sunday is to do such thing for matt uh sandras is certainly uh strong enough to do that which is why you don't want sandras anywhere near you know that's why matt's got to pull him not cross center
Todd Hutchings: know you can do that you can stop somebody like that and pull them without your wrist but it's really hard if you're if you know if i'm a cross center i got him because i'm doing a lot of backwards dragging to do that so matt's got to keep sandra sandra's hand on his side of the table yeah there are some questions i would like to ask curious thing for your super chat
Engin Terzi: He says, this is not a question, but Ermes wins 3-1, John 3-0, Devon 3-2. We need Taras back. Taras Joaquin. You have never seen Taras Joaquin, right? In real life. No, right? Never met in the same event. Top roll is for smart. He is asking, this is nickname. Do Prudnik is stronger than Tata Cings or is it, it's a matter of technique?
Engin Terzi: is prudnik stronger than you or it is all about his uh technique i think prudnik is stronger than me and i think he's got better technique oh he's also stronger than you think i think so um okay um guys there was two more questions i don't know how i just can't go to those those questions uh early super chest there were i just didn't want to
Engin Terzi: um what was it i remember the first one i cannot reach that can somebody write the top two or one superchats um okay so and then what's the next one that you are so sure i mean not all in in iraqi okay one second one second one second sorry about it you are telling matt how to win what he needs to do
Todd Hutchings: but it's not prediction that it's not a prediction i think matt wins if he does that the problem is i've never seen matt do that so if i'm matt's coach this is what he has to do to increase his chances because i put matt and uh matt and sandra said about 50 50. okay i see um
Engin Terzi: Tim, Timmy Turner, can you find the top Super Chat one or two I missed? So please, because I don't want to upset anyone. Okay, what's the next one? Paul Linn in Iraq, Lee, Gam, Tanazi. Yeah. Yeah, that looks like a couple of hook guys going at it. One is like this.
Todd Hutchings: the other one is you know going that way so paul then better get some pronation because that iraqli guy will hang there the only way um and he looks strong there and i saw him hold on to a lot but so paul if he's close he better get some pronation in that hook or else iraqli will will just bleed him dry so
Todd Hutchings: If I was Paul Lynch coach, he'd be doing isometrics with a multi-spinner hanging out there for a long, grueling match. A lot of force and a lot of pronation. Because they're going to go into the hook. So there's no word. Neither one of them is going to do anything goofy. But it's a battle of two different styles of hooks. You think Paul is going to go directly hook? I think so. I have seen Paul trying to go top roll too. But I have seen him hooking both John and Ron.
Engin Terzi: He couldn't finish John, but he hook and beat Rambat. So I think his explosiveness is incredible, incredible. But will it be enough to finish lrakli Kamtenazi or lrakli with his weird unorthodox style like this? You know, he doesn't go like this to other people, you know, the open arm top row. He goes hook and then he drives his shoulder to winning side. And whenever he is like this, even he is on bicep,
Engin Terzi: his arm position is working like pronator here because your arm can't be go to more bicep understand if you are like this your arm is like this you know your pronator is turned but just because you throw yourself here look at your arm is just pronated the guy can't can't go on it because it needs to break your elbow you know yeah so he needs to all better develop a lot of that pronation on his own side or else i think it'll be a hard day for him
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah yeah so and uh what's your suggestion to him did you tell me or hey i hope he's training isometrics but when paul's in that hook he needs to be getting some of that pronation out too he can't let a rockley sit like that he's got to get a rockley twisted up a little bit yeah you know yeah yeah yeah well he's so quick so fast so explosive he just goes there so i mean good you know and
Todd Hutchings: I don't know. I don't know. Like if, if it totally depends where the mess stops or if the mess stops, if the mess stops in an equal, I think they're going to be, I think there'll be 15 second matches. I think there'll be fairly long matches. I think they'll bam and then they'll grind it out. And that's where you'll see, you know, either Paul gets some pronation in there or Paul gets just drug over. So.
Todd Hutchings: But I think they'll hit. I don't think I don't think Iraq will flash pin Paul. So I think it's up to Paul to develop some pronation backwards. Try to, you know, get get Iraq out of that comfortable spot. I mean, if somebody is flashing somebody that match, I think it's Paul because Paul is the one that is explosive one. I mean, I don't know. And how do you what's your prediction? That one, I think, is 50 50.
Engin Terzi: No, 50-50, yeah. I understand. And Arm Wrestling Derek, Derek Smith, thank you, my friend. Engin, I always wanted to hear you and talk, debate about optimal training strategies. What do you feel about the conjugate method? I don't know what it is, my friend. Maybe I know the Turkish meaning, but I don't know what it is in English. Sorry for my limited English.
Todd Hutchings: um so i really don't know um um so what's the next one uh ryan bowen and zarab i don't know how to yeah and i think uh well i think ryan has to pull like chance did um
Todd Hutchings: Ryan doesn't have Chance's hand. This is a hard one for Ryan. And does he have the tools that Chance has? Man, I don't think so. No, this is a tough match for Ryan. I think for Ryan to beat Zurab... Ah, man, I think I would...
Todd Hutchings: tell him to follow that hook as close to the pad as you can and then start trying to pronate that hand out. Mask it, try not to get into a battle like Ron Baff did. I don't think Ryan can pull as long as Ron did. If he could, if Ryan can set up and get clamp onto that hand, get the straps and get a good posting top roll or something, that's about the best he can get. Zurab's leaning into his hook.
Todd Hutchings: think that's a bad day for ryan so ryan's got to do whatever he can to keep zurab standing up neutral since ryan's got a little bit of python zurab i think he could potentially do that um you know the posting type top roll i just yeah this is a tough one for ryan yeah yeah i mean the truth is i see ryan underdog i shouldn't say this but i also share with him
Engin Terzi: how i would pull zurab if i was gonna pull so i mean um i don't know i don't know i think zurab is stronger and ryan is more technical but will it be enough will he have enough of power to make what he know effective against i don't know i don't know
Todd Hutchings: will see i think ryan's best chance is to stay out of the straps i don't think you want zurab in the straps where he can access all that power so i i hope ryan clamps a little bit low on that hand to stop zarab from slipping out and then throws a massive high top roll onto him a nice posting or a nice you know travis top roll
Engin Terzi: I think what I will tell you, Zurab is going, Zurab wouldn't get offended be saying this because he knows that he's clear favorite. So if you are watching this or if somebody tells you this, Zurab, I'm sorry. But Zurab has short arm. He doesn't have long reach, understand? So what he wants to use this bottom two finger and this bottom wrist flexor with the supination and then go sideways that way. So he is getting most of his power
Engin Terzi: uh with this keeping this angle and then pressing that way so if i were right i would i would drop my hand a little bit here and then apply pressure from here before the match to his little finger already to keep here far because he will have to come even more to control that and he's already given his pronated so what i would do i would just keep here far and then whenever zurab is coming this way with supination
Engin Terzi: I would still keep here the pressure and I would at risk or to make his palm on that way and roll so that he would be like this. So that is the way to be because the power is coming with the pressure from the body. So if you cut this pronation on action, and if you already made here, like, you know, with your drop hand pressure, and then you make him go palm up
Engin Terzi: And then while his palm up, if you also roll his bicep that way, it is hard for him to put, you know, the same pressure that when he's tight here. So he needs to cut all the connection between his hand, Zurab's hand and the shoulder then apart, then he can win. Any possibility that Zurab keeps this angle, even his wrist is like this, he can still put so much pressure.
Engin Terzi: you know this you know this yeah do you think ryan should go in the straps or stay out of the straps no it is you know like there are not many people that can secure that and can be sure of that we all need to go every arm wrestling match
Engin Terzi: by thinking that it is going to be a strap match. Evgeny you can train for not to allow, but you cannot depend on it. You know, you need to say, OK, this match is going to be a strap match, you know, because I mean, not many people like everyone. I mean, almost if your name is Levan or something, you don't allow somebody. Evgeny Ongarbe was able to go. Dave Chaffee couldn't, but Ongarbe did it. So I mean, but still, you know, even against Levan, it's possible, you know, so whatever. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: mean like if it is up to ryan i wouldn't go strip but no if i was ryan i'd say grip low like you said do not let do not let him slip if you can't you know make it ugly so much whenever you hold on so much you may get hooked to you so you need to also secure you know you're you're here because you hold on to not allow you may also hook you suddenly so it is not that easy to have the pronator control
Engin Terzi: and control an opponent's hand at the same time, not super easy. And I saw that. I don't know. I don't know. That's a tough road for Ryan. That's a tough match for Ryan. Yeah. I knew the chance was going to beat Zurab. When I said this match, people blame me. Why you do that? Why you do this? Zurab is going to kill him. I mean, if I know about arm wrestling, this is a hard match for Zurab because
Engin Terzi: even you hardly stop chance you got the pronator if you would also lose your pronator like this there he would pin you look at the round yeah it's hard to get your arm out of that if you get whenever whenever he did for the pin his wrist was moving like that because of your pronator he couldn't pass that so if he would also control you like this he would pin you but he couldn't but drop doesn't have that here drop gives totally supinated he gives his
Engin Terzi: for nation and just dives in you know so i'm like i mean that guy chance show once he has this copy he is incredibly incredibly effective guy dangerous guy yeah and what's the next one there justin bishop in mendagas terrace yeah yeah
Todd Hutchings: Uh, this is one where Justin has to, I hope Justin's been training his bands and his plyometrics, and I hope he comes out strong and powerful. I, uh, I don't want Justin to be in a long match here. I want him, but the thing with this is I don't know how long Justin's been inactive. I haven't seen him in years. You know, I hope he's been traded more than just the two or three months that he's known about this. You know what I mean? He said that the reason he couldn't trade was pain.
Engin Terzi: And when he took break, he said that he was super healed up. Everything was just like, like, so good. I mean, to me, the muscle memory is there. Of course you need long train, but being healthy with the joints, I don't know how much you suffer from the joint pain, but we normal human beings, not like you, once you suffer, you know, we really suffer. We can't do anything. So he told me that he was like, not the left arm, but he said his right arm was
Todd Hutchings: super healed up and he's ready to pull and i don't know he's dangerous guy let's see and who's winning there um if justin's well this was another hard match for justin's i don't know if justin's ever been out of the country except for when he went to australia
Engin Terzi: moldova event he came with you in 2008 that's right moldova and that wasn't real successful but for him so uh he goes to iraq iraq is iraqash really but there he be we are aldobrin he didn't perform bad but he wasn't but he was good not bad yeah uh this is one where
Todd Hutchings: I mean, Doggis is tough. He'll be tough for Justin. If Justin's fast, you know, dominates it quick. I don't want Justin in a real long match here. This, I probably think, I wouldn't be, this could be 50-50 just because I haven't seen Justin, you know, pulling. I mean, he might be strong and healthy, but if you haven't competed in a while, you usually go up to that match slow. And
Todd Hutchings: And, you know, and I just, if, if Justin's, if Justin's missing go, he's going to have a hard time. So I really hope he's been practicing. Ready goes in practice. I hope he's been doing his bands. I hope he's been doing his plyometrics. I think power wise, he's there. I'm just afraid of Mindaugas gets the jump on him. You know, Justin's always fighting from a losing position and that makes for a hard day, you know, especially if you're in a foreign country. The match is at 180.
Engin Terzi: and in douglas is about 167 165 i have never seen him 170. yeah yeah so justin should have a power advantage if it does stop i just hope you know i just hope justin's not on the losing on the losing side of the table after go i understand and what's the next one
Todd Hutchings: The last one is Cobra Rhodes and Haydar. I don't have a clue, man. I haven't seen either one of these guys. I mean, I looked on YouTube for Haydar videos. I found one from 13 years ago. And I don't think I've seen Cobra Rhodes for five years. So this is like a classic car race or something. I mean, this is... This is legend category, legend category. For people who have been inactive but in the past were world champions, legendary athletes, this is what it is, you know.
Engin Terzi: so yeah this is a match like that yeah yeah this is for the museum is what this is yeah this is this is like to honor uh our legends from the past you know people who inspired us and you ever heard sharon remez yeah see sharon remez and zaur zaur was the
Todd Hutchings: super heavyweight world champion from 30 years ago they are going to also meet in january event in the super heavyweight legend category so this is that type of uh okay yeah so this is all retro okay that'll be interesting i i can't even begin to predict on this i am i i don't have a clue i know cobra cobra was one of the greatest but yeah that's a long time that's a long time to not do nothing
Engin Terzi: They pulled. They pulled in the WAP final 22 years ago, these two. That's about how long I've been arm wrestling, was 22 years. Yeah, yeah. First time I saw you was 2001 Harley pull, 80 kilo you were. Then you were skinny. You were skinny. I think you were two and out. And then I saw three years later you beat John Brzee in Vegas.
Engin Terzi: I mean, you won at the end by fouls, but to be fair, I think he was pulling two categories. He was pulling 90%. He was. Yeah. Anyway, so, but you have been following, I know you want to only comment on the American guys, but there is like, for example, Morozov versus Revaz's match. You are familiar with these guys. I will pick Morozov on that.
Engin Terzi: in which way you pick him to beat him in a hook or a top roll top roll oh he's gonna top roll him yeah yeah okay let's see let's see that this is also another interesting match two giants you know at the table i i i will be very curious about it will you watch the event do you plan to watch
Engin Terzi: I'm going to watch. You're going to watch? I got to count the strap matches, and I got to count who wins on which table side. Yes, yes, yes. You did a good job with that one, yeah. And also, Ermes Gasparini, Morozov, left arm. I think Ermes. Ermes is going to tackle him with left arm. Yeah. I think Morozov's close.
Todd Hutchings: I don't think Morozov wins this. I think Morozov eventually wins and becomes like some super, super elite champion. And I think we're just starting to see it, but I think Irby's will be well, you know, I think, I think Irby still wins and I think Irby's left-handed match hurts him for his cause Davit Irby's will be like blast. Right.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah yeah so i think that's risky for irby's to pull a left-handed match before pulling that right no no he's gonna pull right arm match first with dave and then later oh really yeah but the same morozov also will pull rewa said they both have right arm match before
Engin Terzi: And then they will, both of them have very tough opponents. And then at the end of the event, they will pull against each other with left arm because yeah, they, they want to save. They kind of see that, you know, um, because if they pull against each other, they will not have any advantage, but they will have disadvantage against their right arm opponents. So that's more fair for them, you know?
Engin Terzi: it is okay i didn't i didn't know that i was assuming that the the irby's match and the john brzenk match would be the last two matches of the night but yeah yeah normally john brzenk match would be the last one but it needs to be there needs to be a match after because they they want some break between you understand these two guys they want to pull and then pull left arm right after and do you know adam warsinski i do not
Engin Terzi: You don't know Adam Borzynski from America, no? Wow, it's interesting. He's rocking under 90, 95 kilo. He's beating some tough guys. Yeah, wow, it's interesting that you don't know your guy. Well, he wasn't on the list you gave me, was he? He should be. Bozhidar and Adam Borzynski. Can you check? I will check.
Engin Terzi: Let's see. Oh, I'd like, I'd see. You see? Wait, let me get to the list. See, this guy is, do you know how we, why it is interesting that you don't know this guy?
Engin Terzi: Do you know who's speaking this? Who? Chad Silvers. Oh, I know Chad Silvers. Of course you know. I think at the beginning he was also your coach. Yeah, he was. Yeah, you know what? He's coming also to Istanbul to coach Adam. Okay. Oh, that'd be nice. I wish I was there then. Yeah, he will be at his corner, yeah. Well, I've heard of Bozhidar. I haven't heard of Adam, so...
Todd Hutchings: But if Adam's from the West, I guess what I would, yeah, then he should win. How would I coach? Of course, if Chad's his coach, he's already got his top rolling game down. So I would probably also coach him to work on his side pressure. Yeah, yeah. See, Derek Smith, thank you for your support, my friend. Engin, I believe Revaz will roll Morozov, he says.
Engin Terzi: says that Revaz is going to upload and this is coming from someone who pulled them both of the guys one in may and the one in august and he thinks that Revaz is gonna be uh uh derek if you're watching this you don't need to do super chat just you can answer normal um the reason that you believe that Revaz that you pull against Morozov
Engin Terzi: was stronger than Morozov or you are making an estimation that thinking that now three and a half months later more Revaz should progress more than Morozov progress because Morozov has been already at top. He's just pushing the limits while Revaz just started to peak. What's the reason that you think that he's gonna win?
Engin Terzi: One guy said that this is too late to get signed t-shirt for $100. No, my friend, it's not too late. Maybe one of the moderators can share if they have the time to do. We have been here almost one hour to 2051 here. So 151 there. So let's do like last nine, 10 minutes about the opinion that Levan gave recently. He said that
Engin Terzi: The Devon that he felt in Dubai is the number two guy in the world, according to him. Do you agree that Devon that you felt in Canada might be the number two guy in the world or not? I don't know if I could rank them like that. I think there's a top elite level, and I think that's Devon.
Todd Hutchings: yeah i think there's a group of people below that whether they're number two three and four or number four three and two i don't know what order they would be in but uh i think devon's definitely in the you know the highest tier you can be without being lavon you know okay so you are saying that devon is a very legged candidate for number two in the world he is he may be right he may be there right
Todd Hutchings: He may be, I mean, I think he's a legit, you know, um, contender for that, but I wouldn't know, you know, um, as far as whether he's two or three or four, I can't, I can't judge that close. I'm going to look up this, Adam. We're thinking while we're talking, he, he, he likely be Paul Talbot. Oh, and before then he beat one of the good guys, good American guys, little bit older guys, but.
Engin Terzi: uh i forgot his name people american people here would remind me all right let's look this guy up and let's go to upload date who said who said thank you for your support my friend okay yeah here's he is pulling um paul talbot yeah who said thank you for your super chat kurdecha versus beijing left hand
Engin Terzi: My friend, I imagine says that he's not going to be back. He said that he doesn't want to be back. All the addresses will be collected for the signed t-shirts. When you donate the money, the address that you are using, you will receive a message and you will be asked for the address. And then after the events,
Engin Terzi: when after everyone signed the t-shirts and the t-shirts will be shipped to you. And about the t-shirt signing, here is right in front of me, one of the most experienced guys, Pat Hutchings. All right. This Adam Wawrzynski looks pretty tough. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Very tough. He's slow, they say. His endurance, they say, incredible. Yeah. Yeah. So...
Todd Hutchings: I think it will be a very tough match. Oh, here he is versus Paul Passmore. Is it a recent match? It's a YouTube short. I can't tell. Let's see. That was posted two months ago.
Engin Terzi: I don't know, with right arm, right arm, he's in a winning. He looks good. And if Chad's coaching him, he'll be fast. I mean, he'll be fast off goal. So I, yeah, I think Adam can beat Bozhidar. Limit is, before you say, it's 202 pounds, 92 pounds, they agreed. And Bozhidar is about 187.
Todd Hutchings: i was going to say that adam is 95 kilo guy he will be 92 at the weigh-in so i'm expecting him to be a 95 kilo so yeah that uh yeah i like adam's chances i mean he's got the size he looks like he's going to be fast which is usually a detriment to the to that west we're usually over guys on the table so uh yeah
Todd Hutchings: he's gonna have a strong hand and a knuckle if chad coached him so yeah i mean i'm expecting a war because you know bojidar also a warrior you know he can pull forever and he does and he don't quit yeah he can have one long match after another after another it'll be yeah yeah we'll see how much uh we'll see how much gas adam has him to take i mean i i mean adam adam what people says that once he stops the match
Engin Terzi: he really drains you you know he just like sucks your energy they say to him like a middleweight version of devon about the endurance but i don't know i don't know how it is what um anyway so you can you can probably ask chet if you are in touch with him and then he can he can tell you and
Engin Terzi: For the people who didn't watch the beginning of the chat, you are saying that if Devon comes, he's going to beat Prudnik, but in a rematch, Prudnik is going to beat him. If Devon comes in November, he is slightly favorite, while if he comes in January, he is heavily favorite. So just basically in a short, correct?
Engin Terzi: Yep, that's exactly what I believe. Yeah, okay. Anyways, my friend, thank you very much for your time and thank you for your predictions. It's always a pleasure. I'll see you in January. Yeah, yeah, see you in January. You will have some tough opponents. I always do. Yeah, yeah, you do, you do, you do. And we are honored to have you here, my friend. And you take care of yourself and hope to see you in, what, two months, two and a half months. Yes, sir. Bye-bye.
Engin Terzi: Yep. Hello, guys. Any, any? Any question you guys wanna ask? Okay, anyway, so. Okay, I better go.
Engin Terzi: Because every day I do live, probably. Oh, by the way, Thursday, I will have Dave Chaffee and Ermes Gasparini. And I may even call. Are you answering me? Sorry, I missed it. Let me find what you said. Why can I not find?
Engin Terzi: I didn't see the answer. Can you just copy and paste so I can? There's one guy that
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so, okay guys, Thursday, Ermes Gasparini and Dave Chaffee and Capitan Charisma, thank you for your, why can't I find the interview with Travis? You will see the parts on the East versus West new YouTube channel, my friends.
Engin Terzi: victor john bersink versus kidder galley ongar in apple possible engine yes it is possible is it all up to the athletes i mean it's all up to the athletes no no i saw that i saw that he said and you know i believe rivers will roll morozov i saw this but that that's not what i am asking he thinks that he's gonna roll morozov is because what he felt that way that day or he thinks that
Engin Terzi: Since Rehwas will have another three and a half months from August to November 19, he thinks that he will progress more than Morozov will progress. This is what I was asking. Sean, I don't think that anybody is calling anybody a liar, but that is Levan's opinion, and Levan's opinion really weighs heavy. I respect that.
Engin Terzi: If somebody is thinking different, it doesn't automatically mean they're calling him a liar, but he just thinks that probably, you know, he thinks, believes differently. What is that? I believe Revaz is gaining quickly, also believes stylistically Morozov interacts with his right hook that leaves his wrist to be attacked easier. I understand that. Thank you for your opinion, my friends.
Engin Terzi: If you are using Zoom business and using PC, there is a virtual live caption auto-translate when people speak in different language, so you can read it immediately on the caption. Oh, does it translate good? If it is translating as good as YouTube is doing, I am not sure if it's a good idea. Next match for Tata Genghis. Next match for Tata Genghis, my friend, Petrenko Margarine, possibly, but
Engin Terzi: both Petrenko and Hutchings may be pulling some others, you know, but it looks like that match, but you know, anything can happen. Um, John versus Ongarobe in April makes more sense since John is most likely. Yeah. Yeah. John is not going to pull event in January. Thank you, Timbala. Thank you, my friend. Um, you will find Travis Pageant live in parts on the
Engin Terzi: East versus West YouTube channel, the official YouTube channel that people have been sharing here. That's where you will find them. Yeah. Yeah, East versus West t-shirts will be signed by Levan, Splengo, Burzing and all the other competing athletes and myself as well. And we will cover the shipment. And who knows, maybe more people
Engin Terzi: engine are you going to mexico i may go to mexico or do that the different stem cells that they are having maybe amtv engine what will be your next interview i don't know i don't know i will just go and arrange you know um igor paseka yeah it would be good yeah yeah but igor paseka in hook
Engin Terzi: I mean, remember Igor Paseka lost to Krasimir and Margarit. Margarit is the one that sent Krasimir to B-side. That draw played a big role in that category.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Devon is going to for sure, I believe he's going to pull Rudny. I don't know when, but soon we will know. And I think that will be one of the most important matches in the history because besides John, when I think about like technically, you know, superior to most of the top athletes, you know, both
Engin Terzi: but Prudnik has incredible table IQ. Devon, at least as good as Prudnik. And these two are incredibly smart. Devon is more experienced, has more endurance, while Prudnik also have good endurance, but is for sure more explosive than Devon.
Engin Terzi: So Devon is going to 253 while Brutnik is going up to 253. Remember, the Brutnik that we saw against Tartashins was 107 kilo. The Brutnik that we will see in Istanbul will be 115 kilo, 8 kilo heavier. And the Devon that we saw against Levan was 130 kilo. Now,
Engin Terzi: If we see that match, Devon will be 15 kilo lighter. So anything can happen with that match, anything. Like my mind is saying Devon, but I will not be surprised if Prudnik wins. We will have a website, East versus West.
Engin Terzi: west website soon i think you will find all the information there yeah yeah yeah yeah i believe that uh prudnik is better than his top top eight shape
Engin Terzi: I mean, we give not the competition t-shirts that athletes are having on them, but we give the t-shirt with the athletes' pictures and the athletes sign on. I don't know about that one. Maybe, I think not. They were very close like brothers.
Engin Terzi: Can we have John on before East versus West? I already have John on YouTube program. But that would be good if I would have, if Devon would come, it would be good to have Devon, Brittany, and John in the same program. It would be very good. It would be fun. You need to open a Patreon page for East versus West. I think we will do whatever is necessary.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, is the best pound for pound writer from Kazakhstan. I mean, from Kazakhstan, yes, he may be the best pound for pound, Polish, but in the world, he's still one of the candidates. Can you please ask Uncle Todd if he's willing to have a rematch with Iraqi? Todd is gone, the interview finished.
Engin Terzi: my thoughts on Sandris versus Matt Massey, it can go anywhere. But I try not to give prediction because I'm the organizer. I don't want to be misunderstood. A lot of people are looking forward to, you know, is it 100% you will pull in your event again? If I'm back, if I feel ready, yeah, I want to pull, yeah. But I need to
Engin Terzi: need to be careful because and we also buy unsigned t-shirts meaning i don't want to wear t-shirt with signature yes you better not work because you will have to wash it and the signatures will go away that is why we do standard large size so that you will save it just like a collection um yeah i'm training like i started um i don't know if it's gonna be two guys this is
Engin Terzi: All I want is just to cover the expenses. I mean, I can easily put there, I will tell you, to be honest, I can easily put there five, six matches and would reach to similar pay-per-view numbers. But my intention is not that. My intention is I want to make arm wrestling popular, but not only the popular guys. I want to make lightweight popular. I want to, like in January, we will have
Engin Terzi: Barbara versus Gabriella match and lightweight matches. I want to make arm wrestling popular as we have legend category. Why? Because there has been some great arm wrestlers from the past and I want them to be also known by community. So that is my intention.
Engin Terzi: tv yes i mean if they can cover the events then yeah i mean why not i mean but in some way we need to cover these expenses i mean i tell you what pay-per-view is not covering the events that i'm organizing that's why i'm doing other things and i'm barely covering
Engin Terzi: I don't want to talk more openly, no need for the details. If I didn't love armwrestling this much, if I didn't love the community, if I didn't love the armwrestlers and respect their sweat, I wouldn't be doing this. I love it, that's why I'm doing it. And so, how to say, that is not as some people think.
Engin Terzi: when is the east versus west eight time let's see let's see let's first focus on um yeah yeah give me yeah east versus west alijan will pull this versus west six is supposed to pull oleg zok but i will talk with both of them and let's see you know um
Engin Terzi: And there was a comment some time ago offering $50,000 support. Did that guy lie? Or actually, I don't know if he lied or joking or whatever. Nobody contacted me. One guy one time contacted me. He said he's going to support my event. You know, like from Instagram, he said like $1,000 or something. The next thing he said, oh, it's too small. I will support you $25,000. And then later he said $10,000. And then he disappeared.
Engin Terzi: I mean, it's okay. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not depending on these things. I'm depending on the community support, you know, generally. Thank you. Thank you, Ioanna.
Engin Terzi: it versus wait in June. I don't know. I will tell you guys something. The summer events are even more expensive, expensive. The airplane tickets are much more expensive. Hotels are full, so they are making the price up. You know, we really need to be careful. Listen, you know why I'm so transparent about this kind of things with you guys, because this is something that we do together, all together we are doing.
Engin Terzi: So whenever I do something, I explain to you guys that so you would understand why I'm doing things like the way that I'm doing. Markship, where can I contact you? I would love to support the Atlas for upcoming events and help pay for flights and hotels. Let me know, my friend. You can reach me through Messenger, through Instagram and
Engin Terzi: also through my email address right here. By the way, guys, if you want to know that two spots left, in fact, there was one spot left for the VIP sponsorship, but because Jerry got injured, so it looks like Politalia is not going to come either.
Engin Terzi: or two spots left for the VIP. Justin remember, we cover in a five-star hotel, your three nights. And you will join the dinner together with Levan, Dennis, John Burzin, Gennady, Alex, Ermes, Dave Chappie, all of these guys, Morozov, you know, all of those guys. And you will have a professional picture. And you will get one signed t-shirt.
Engin Terzi: and you will have access to enter the short signing room with those stars. And then you will join the press conference and you will have a right to ask a question live during the press conference. And during the event, you will have the front seat VIP. If you are interested, you can reach me from the email address that I just shared.
Engin Terzi: Let Travis start the engine for the product part. I don't know what it means. What happened to Travis? The Travis stream will be with arts on the East versus West YouTube channel.
Engin Terzi: Do you think this will never ever happen again? So many armwrestling champions, athletes together at one place. Yeah, that is one of the reasons that Devon wanted to come so much for this event, because in the same room, there is Levan, there is Denis, there is John Burzin, Cobra and himself and many others, you know. So for me too, I want to have a special picture together.
Engin Terzi: All together, yes, but also with some of these guys separately. East versus West in Las Vegas, 2020. Come to America. Yeah, I would love to do that. I really need to talk with John. John, like, yeah. If I'm going to do something in the US, like, the first person to contact for me is John Brzee. And, of course, Devon as well. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: if you kneel and talk after the semester. No, we didn't talk. We didn't talk. I think we will talk, yeah. My friend, Ungarbe in Iraq, they are going to pull in January. If John, I mean, if Ungarbe beats Iraq, I don't think that if John beats Ungarbe later on, you'll need to pull Iraq. I think the winner, I think that John,
Engin Terzi: uh he's gonna pull the winner along this is what i'm just saying i think he just wants would you ever consider doing an arm wrestling reality show showing the training and growth of our masters out of competition and beyond
Engin Terzi: Yeah, that would be nice. Yeah, maybe I would do it for my own self too, because I just had stem cells. I just started training. I'm sometimes thinking, because I started so light, maybe I should film it and share, you know, how it is going and things like that. I mean, would people be interested in that or no? I don't know. Chance versus Ongarbev in Iraq, a good match. I don't know, my friend. I don't know. They are both very good couples.
Engin Terzi: Any guy that is going inside with chance would be better for chance than going outside. But of course, chance is great. Did you get any feedback from all two labs? I imagine they are very happy with all the views. I'm sure they are happy too. I mean, because I mean, yeah, East versus West is getting more and more popular. So I think that they are happy and I'm happy too.
Engin Terzi: get their support uh while um um okay i suspect who wants to get you know no need for elites ben is better um how would you join in iraq i don't know i was thinking i don't know it's very close match
Engin Terzi: did you lose muscle mass after stem cell on arm? I didn't lose because of that, but because of being inactive for almost two months, I'm like, okay, I'm going to go train. And I started with very light. And then I stopped training. So there is no constant training for me. So chest, shoulder, arms, like they, I mean, if I start training, good, it will come back. You will see in one month, two months, it will come back.
Engin Terzi: In a long time ago, you mentioned about your graphic designer work on a comic series. I think, yes. I don't know what he's doing lately. He's helping me, but hope stem cells work their magic through 24. Thank you, my friend. Let's see. Let's see. It is from my own cells. So my own cells are also 48 years old. Let's see. What do you guys think about making it like
Engin Terzi: the guy who wins four rounds instead of the guy who wins three rounds, how do you guys see that? Like if I make it, you know, the guy who wins three rounds wins, it's not like actually six rounds, but the one who reaches four rounds. I mean, if I do that, it's kind of get even longer, but maybe for the title matches, I don't know. I'm not going to decide.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah the beginning of the stream if you watch the touchings was yeah there yeah yes yes yes yes if i do that you know extra rounds i need to uh make
Engin Terzi: I think every day match with three round shots. He proved otherwise in just remember Alex Burdecha match and remember Vitaly match. He was not out of gas in those matches.
Engin Terzi: yeah if you beat the guy two times in a row you're better than you yeah i mean it depends on the agreement my friend if they agree that way they agree that way but if you go in somewhere win three rounds you cannot say that you know i want the first two rounds i'm better than you i mean whatever the rule that you accept i mean there cannot be an opinion
Engin Terzi: anonymous um have you found open this event is he definitely attending yes he is definitely attending yeah maybe yeah my channel is more than that more than that with the lives and everything from the beginning i think near 11 million but that number must be correct as well maybe without lives
Engin Terzi: I mean, again, guys, whatever is happening with East versus West, we are doing all together. Also on Brian Shaw's potential. To be honest, I'm very, very busy. I saw the interview, some part of the interview with Derek and Brian Shaw. But other than that, I didn't have so much time to watch the actual training. I don't really know much about it.
Engin Terzi: Maybe Derek can inform me. If I go to Mexico, I may try stem cells in a different way than mine, what I had. But for sure it's not embryo or something. I would never do such thing. The best match in this year is the Zurab Tavberidze versus Graham Betts. Nothing even close. Little kayak, nice podcasting in.
Engin Terzi: I wish you all the best. Thank you for your support, my friend. Thank you for everything. You are welcome, my friend. You are welcome. So let's see. Let's see how it will be. I need to do a lot of work. I need to do a lot of work. Let's see. Let's see. Let me contact last time with Devon and then see if I see anything. If not, I'm going to probably find someone else. I need to be careful. Many people are suggesting me to
Engin Terzi: a super heavyweight guy for Brunei. Him being a super heavyweight guy, a top guy, made that be put him in a risk to get injured as January event is only two months later. Yeah, Sheffy versus Laletin was very good too. Justin go and rewatch Zurab versus Rambet. You will understand the difference.
Engin Terzi: Oh, Brian is basically the goat of this sports. If he's interested in arm wrestling, he will bring more ice. Wow, it's interesting. They will rather much love. I really hope you will talk, Matushenko, about all this. And Bogoslav, have you seen this latest ? It's insane. Wow, I didn't know. I didn't know. I want to invite Matushenko for a YouTube interview before the Esports Fest. Let's see what he's thinking.
Engin Terzi: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Anyways, guys, so I'd rather go and continue working for Peace vs. Rest. You all take care and thank you for your support.
