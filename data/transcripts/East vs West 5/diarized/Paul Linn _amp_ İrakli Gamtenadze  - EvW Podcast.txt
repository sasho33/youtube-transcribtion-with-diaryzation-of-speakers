Engin Terzi: This is huge, huge, huge, huge poster. It is not paper, but it is high quality, you know. And because after I had to stop, I had to stop the GoFundMe donation because I didn't want Atlas to sign too many T-shirts. Most of them, you know, signs after the event, so no need to worry.
Engin Terzi: And but so I didn't want them to sign the help me to cover the event. But many people ask, you know, Oh, did we missed it? Because in one day, he went from 130 t shirts, to 260 t shirts. So I, people were like, Oh, we want something memory from this event. So I thought about poster, but I had to sell less so that they will not get so tired. Also,
Engin Terzi: I'm gonna give the help of the what's profits help goes to the cover the event and help will go to the atlas. I talked with them and and they said they will gladly sign them.

Engin Terzi: So, lrakli, how have you been, my friend? Good? Good, thank you. Okay, Roman, we don't need you. You can go. Okay, ciao. He speaks English already. lrakli, can you put your phone sideways? Yeah, thank you.
Engin Terzi: Thank you, my friend. So, lrakli, when did you compete last time? The last time you competed, it was in USA? Yes, USA. Yes, in USA. Pennsylvania. Right in Paul's stage.
İrakli Gamtenadze: He said that Pauline was the organizer who set this competition. It's our state championship. We do it every year in the summer. You do it every year? Yeah, this coming year will be our state championship.
İrakli Gamtenadze: He was one of the first to win the World Cup. And then he was the next to win the World Cup. And then he was the next to win the World Cup. And then he was the next to win the World Cup. And then he was the next to win the World Cup. And then he was the next to win the World Cup. And then he was the next to win the World Cup. And then he was the next to win the World Cup. And then he was the next to win the World Cup. And then he was the next to win the World Cup.
İrakli Gamtenadze: It was a 50-kilometre ride, and we couldn't get out of it, and we had to go back to Georgii. We had to go back, we had to go to Wales.
Roman (Translator): So, uh, yeah, he was saying, so he was saying that, uh, um, after he won this competition that you have set, uh, ball, uh, then he was invited to, uh, to the WAL against Rob vision junior, but unfortunately because of COVID, he had to drop weight. So he could not manage to take the challenge. And at the end, he obviously, uh, said gratitude and thanks to you, Paul, for this opportunity that you gave her.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but after that, did I not see him playing with Brandon? Who was it? I mean, like lately I saw him. Yeah, you pull him even after the COVID or during the COVID or something. Can you tell him? No, no, no.
Roman (Translator): No, it was not after COVID. It was not after COVID. He has not competed in USA after COVID. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And how is his shape right now? Can you ask him? Yeah, yeah, for sure. .
İrakli Gamtenadze: So he's saying that he's in a good form, he's keeping his shape up to date and keeps working out.
Roman (Translator): uh 80 98 kg yeah 98 kg he's right now last time when he competed in usa it was not as serious as uh he could be right now against paul it was not in the best shape he could have been but right now he's in a good shape again yeah so he's in a good shape enough to beat paul uh
Engin Terzi: yes of course 100 percent 100 sure yeah he's 100 sure and he said he he once told me that um like even if paul was 110 kilo he would still beat him even he's 95 kilo does he still feel that confident
İrakli Gamtenadze: Tell him that I will now tell Paul to not to lose the weight if it is okay for lrakli.
Roman (Translator): So he's saying that it's quite tough for him to lose weight. So he would prefer Paul also to struggle like he's struggling to lose weight.
Engin Terzi: I thought it wouldn't matter. I think he said he was 98 kilograms, so I think I'm already lighter. Oh, really? What's your weight right now? Maybe like 96, 97. 96, 97. So almost a couple of pounds. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So almost the same. Yeah. And exactly.
Roman (Translator): Will Paul's giant bag save him from you?
Roman (Translator): This like back muscles is good when he's walking down to the beach during summer, but not in arm wrestling. It's not going to make sense. But not at the East versus West, right? Yeah, not right now. No way. Only from here to here, that's it.
İrakli Gamtenadze: Yes, that's what I wanted to say. Yes, I have my own exercises and I don't do strong exercises. And that's how I train my legs, my biceps, my hips and so on.
Roman (Translator): he's saying that he uh consider like a speaking out of his uh training regime he's saying that he he's not like um the type of guy who hits um his max over and over time he's trying to not push too much limits he has his own routine and basically with enough time he's just focused on his biceps his arm strength not just like to do everything like at maximum level all the time so he's keeping it a bit light
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but we need all of them. I mean, no matter how strong you have your arm, you know, what is connected to your body, you know, that needs to put the pressure. So that connection, shoulder, back, chest, everything is important. And Paul, we are having a little bit hard time to hear your voice. And even in the chat, people say, if you can somehow raise the volume of your microphone or something. I don't know if it is. I'll take the earphones out. That might be the problem.
Engin Terzi: yeah can you try now is this any better not really not better now it's okay i think just can't talk again any any louder now yeah yeah now yes better
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah it's okay it's okay yeah so um what what do you think about all this that your opponent is saying that your back is good for the beach and this and that you know he's gonna beat you when you're 110 kilo and you know 100 is gonna win
Paul Linn: If he wasn't confident, then I would be disappointed. So I hope to face the best possible version of him so that there's no question in mind. Whoever wins, there's no arguments. I have no excuses if I lose and he's a better man. Yeah, yeah.
Roman (Translator): lrakli, sorry Engin, I will say something to lrakli. lrakli, what do you think about the fact that you speak English fluently? Do you agree with that or do you agree with the fact that you speak English fluently? No, I don't agree with that. I mean, I have friends who speak English fluently. I mean, I have friends who speak English fluently. I mean, I have friends who speak English fluently.
İrakli Gamtenadze: Okay, okay.
Roman (Translator): I asked you for translation, but you seem like you became moderated.
Roman (Translator): no no no no i will i will explain everything like okay i will tell you right now so i asked make sure that paul um iraqli knows english too and i did not want to uh translate to him too much so i did not want to take too much time off you guys and but he still he still told me that he's outside right now and he would prefer to i would translate everything yeah okay yeah anyway so yeah so basically you are saying that i mean what what do you think about elective style
Engin Terzi: that is not exactly the brachioradialis type of the open arm, but is more like bicep type of this weird style. It's a style that even you turn his pronator, because he forces himself here, it seems like he's still pronated there. In fact, his pronator is turned, but because he forces himself, so he doesn't turn anymore. So have you studied all this and have you ever pulled someone like that?
Paul Linn: Um, so I think probably the match that you're referring to is the Vitaly Lillet match, which is the first time in my research that I, that I saw a Rackley really dropped into, I guess, um, Ryan Bowen calls that a King's hook.
Paul Linn: I've never pulled anyone in competition who is able to successfully do it. So I'm not super familiar with it. But from the matches that I saw from Iraq and Pennsylvania and some of the other more recent matches, he seems, if he's not stressed out, he seems to be very technical high hooker.
Paul Linn: um his setup is that of a high hook with a post dropping down into side pressure and he stays tight he stayed tight and he seemed very fundamentally sound in just about every match other than that uh vitality so i know he has that in his arsenal that's definitely something new to me um but i feel pretty comfortable on my biceps bro
Roman (Translator): Okay, I will briefly translate that.
Roman (Translator): The whole body, which is the center of the whole body, is moving, but the muscles of the muscles are the ones that move. This muscle is your interest, your interest, and everyone knows that. And everyone knows that it is a very new muscle of mine, it is the muscle of the muscle, and that's why it is in the arsenal of the body, it is in you, and it is connected to me, it is connected to me, it is connected to me, it is connected to me.
İrakli Gamtenadze: There is no doubt that this style is not suitable for young people. It is not suitable for young people who do not know how to work. It is not suitable for young people who do not know how to work.
Roman (Translator): okay so he said about this style that uh he's focused on something else right now or even though like you said paul it's his uh one of his styles he doesn't uh he's not gonna go he's not gonna going to use that style in this case he has something else in his mind so he's kind of true we'll try to avoid that that's what he said
Paul Linn: I figured as much. I figured that style was specifically for that Vitaly match. And he was successful in that. It was a huge win, unbelievable match. Endurance is great. And like I said, I've gotten to see him pull firsthand live against a lot of guys that I know. I know his form now is going to be much, much better. So in my mind, I'm preparing for that, you know, times two.
Paul Linn: So I've been able to work a little bit with some of the Georgii around here as well. So I've done my research as much as I possibly can. I have the utmost respect for the Georgii team as a whole and for Iraqi specifically and all of his accomplishments. So for me, whenever I get offered these matches, I just I'm grateful if I can compete.
Paul Linn: um and show that i can compete with the europeans and the georgians to me that's good enough obviously i'm coming to win like that's the plan but um even being offered and considered these considered for these matches is honor for me enough that's our honor my friend you deserve 100 percent
Roman (Translator): So, this is a big problem for me, especially since I live in Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii, I have a big problem with Georgii,
Roman (Translator): I have two questions for you. One is that you have a world title. Is it right arm or left arm?
Engin Terzi: And the second question, people don't know much about the Atlas from the East. You know, WAF is the toughest event in the world, especially under 100 kilo. Evgeny 110 is tough, super heavyweight is tough, but like 100 and under, 90 and under is just nightmare, you know. And people, they follow most likely the English-speaking Western pullers, but they don't know much about the, I mean, the Eastern pullers.
Engin Terzi: So my intention to organize this event, just to unite the East and West, and then just we have one world and then just let the best ones to pull, since we have only one world, you know, and then pull against each other. And you are one of those athletes, people don't know much about you. Can you tell us the athletes that you, the famous athletes that you defeated during your career?
Roman (Translator): Well, when I first came to the Champions League, I didn't expect that I would be able to compete with Marciana and Marciana Zuz. This was the first time. And the second time was when I heard that the fans of the club and the fans of this club were very happy to see me. And they were very happy to hear that I was able to compete with them.
Roman (Translator): And what I wanted to say to you is that in this category, there is a lot of catastrophe and there is a lot of competition. And this is not the case for many of us. And I wanted to say that you, from the point of view of young people, from the point of view of people who are young and old, I think it is possible to come to this conclusion. That's what I wanted to say.
Roman (Translator): He says that he is a world champion at the right hand. And European champion on both arms.
İrakli Gamtenadze: 40 kg, right? Yes, 40 kg. 90 kg. The 2nd and 3rd rounds were held in Europe and in the Soviet Union. The problem is that there is no interest in the Americans. Yes, because the American people are more interested in the English people than the Russian people. Yes, but in the Soviet Union, the Americans
İrakli Gamtenadze: There was no such thing as a mass scale. In Pennsylvania, it was all American. There was no such thing as a mass scale in Europe or in the world.
Roman (Translator): So he's saying that like champions, he's been already said, and he kept being like a third, second, third place on both arms overall. And he also said about the guys who competed against me, he said that usually it's more like Eastern people, not Western people. Evgeny in Pennsylvania, there were no such big names that people would know. I'm not talking about Europeans. Who did he beat?
İrakli Gamtenadze: no yeah he said overall it's still he he's uh he's people okay he has beaten them
Engin Terzi: So he beat Ruslan, right? Not Ruslan. Ruslan. Ruslan, yes. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev. Ruslan Babayev.
Paul Linn: imagine and paul is gonna face this guy that's we talk about it we talk about it and that's the problem um the the the social media presence for everyone on the west is so much more so the perception is that these guys from the west are in the limelight um and most of the followers of arm wrestling don't follow off that closely
Paul Linn: and don't really know what's in the rest of the world i think that was so good about east versus west though it's allowing for people like ermys and and if any prudnik who are you know starting to learn to speak english and their personalities are coming through it's shedding light on to the quality of arm wrestling in the east as well as the characters and the fact that these european guys do also have charisma and character as well
Engin Terzi: yes yes they always had it but other people didn't know what it is because they this the the we talk to communicate we speak but when you cannot communicate you don't know what it is you know so that is my goal but when when you go a competition against iraqi people are thinking oh
Engin Terzi: everyone is pulling a tough guy, but not Paul, you know, Paul's openly unknown. If I get my ass kicked, everybody's what, you know? I mean, if you lose, they will just say you lost an unknown guy. Yeah. Unknown guy. And, um,
Engin Terzi: As long as I know I'm okay with it. I'm just saying that there are a lot of people who are not well known by the Western fans. That's why it's East vs West. This is a very tough match. I'm telling to people. Paul is incredibly strong. Paul, your performance against
Engin Terzi: rambet against john berzing you know and some others you're incredible but your opponent is also incredible so it is like unbelievable match but people because there are so many matches like dave cheffy hermes devon but it's my fault i probably had 20 people uh reach out to me or talk to me at practice assuming that i was pulling iraqis iraqis feeling
Engin Terzi: oh okay and i actually know them and they say wait hold on there's another george in iraq i said yeah he's a world champion so yeah yeah in america you have many michael name paul name you know name and so many different names you know not every iraq is really and uh is older older than uh zarakashvili has been pulling probably about 15 years
Roman (Translator): 18 years. I know him for about 15 years for sure. Probably those three years were the time that he was getting better to be part of the national team. In juniors, it was 2006 years when he was first time participant in Europeans. So at the juniors. So since then, yeah.
Roman (Translator): Did he go to the same year to Manchester for the World Championships? Because of surgery, unfortunately, he was not in Manchester. Okay, he went to Hungary, but not England. Okay, that year, 2006, yeah, I understand. Yeah. I'm an old guy, too.
İrakli Gamtenadze: I was born in 2007. I was born in 2007. I think that Americans, Europeans, I mean, I think that the people of my generation, the people of Pakistan, the people of Sadamian, the people of Khels and the people of India, if they are strong, they will win. If they are strong people, they will win. But Americans, even if they are passive, they are not interested.
İrakli Gamtenadze: The European Union, the SMG Union.
Roman (Translator): he said that every nation has their own type of like uh one of the top guys uh and he's familiar of them if there is someone in Pakistan or someone in India or someone some somewhere else but he underlined the fact that USA guys are not showing as much interest against Europeans as I guess he would wish to see right so that's that's kind of fact that we don't have such a
Engin Terzi: It's not about arm wrestling only. We live in an age that entertainment is more important than what is necessary, necessity. Like, as I always say that now, I mean, people like, even if you put pure arm wrestling, pure arm wrestling, you know, they like it, but they want some addition.
Engin Terzi: They want a story which is, you know, and that is why, you know, but to have their story, you need to understand the language. So when the guys don't speak the language and they are from this side of the world, they don't do so much like hype, hype, hype things, you understand? Like is the Western side of the world. So two different worlds. So here is more quiet, more just doing the job. The other one is still doing the job, but also likes to make it
Paul Linn: exciting you understand so and so that's my opinion that's why they don't know you know i think i think that there is a contingency of americans who do desperately want to prove themselves against europeans
Paul Linn: i think that there are some out there i know personally i i get offered matches in the united states all the time um but i would much prefer coming over to turkey uh to me those opportunities are invaluable um i i can pull guys from the united states at any given time at any given tournament that's kind of lost its luster to me unless it's somebody in a higher weight class or something so for me and i know justin bishop guys like that paul talbot
Engin Terzi: all of those guys are desperately wanting to prove themselves over in east versus west paul i will tell you something very seldom that i get a no from an american puller or canadian puller whenever i said would you pull here i mean 99 you know i mean they say yes yes yes and they are very i'll say happy you understand yeah they're very happy so they are how to say i mean they are very brave you know
Engin Terzi: They just want to come and prove themselves. They are not really scared of anything. I mean, my experience, because I offered them and then they are like, let's go. They don't even say, I'm going to give you answer two hours later or tomorrow or three days. Only they have to date. And then if they do something bad for their business, work or a family, something instead,
Engin Terzi: Then that time they say, OK, I can come not this one, but the next one. But they are in for 100%.
Paul Linn: Yes, we don't get those opportunities as much. And a lot of times, like, you know, our federation and everything, of course, you know, the Americans participate in worlds as well. But to be honest, like in preparation for that and, you know, all the logistics involved in that is harder than what you provide. And so it's like it's a no brainer decision when you're offered the opportunity to compete against Europeans. Because to us, there's a huge value in it for self affirmation.
Paul Linn: so you know if we'd beaten everybody in the united states and in the social media world thinks we're better than we are um that doesn't really i don't think for a lot of us it doesn't affirm our own self-work self-worth so i think there's a great amount of us that do want to come over and test ourselves yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i understand yeah but but it is for anyone i mean like that is like
Engin Terzi: The world is bigger than our own nation, you understand this? So if you want to prove that you are number one, I mean, that is the place. And also, who wouldn't want to be in the same team with John Brzee, Michael Todd, Matt Matt, Devon Lara, Dave Chaffee, Jerry Cadoret, Pauline. Justin look at the team. I wish we could make all of them at one event. If I had a chance, I would do it. I'm crazy enough to do it.
Paul Linn: Well, that's the interesting thing for East versus West as well. Arm wrestling is such an individual sport. Unless you're going and representing your country at Worlds or Europeans or whatever it may be, unless you're going with a team, it's very individualistic.
Paul Linn: And I think as these events have progressed on, there has been a little bit more team camaraderie and, you know, the fan support actually caring whether the East or West does well. So it's really evolved into something different. And it's a unique setting where you get to go and see all these guys don't always get to see. You get to talk to them, you get to strategize with them, and then you get to support them and root for them when you're not actually competing yourself.
Engin Terzi: yeah it's very very healthy even when you have someone at your corner it makes you guys like so you know it elevates you when you know you got somebody who's better than you supporting you and giving you their energy uh hockey you know feed off that and and does it also create some kind of strong story remember you we were in you know
Paul Linn: over there overseas in Istanbul, you know, we were together, you know, that's, I think that's good memory as well. I hear, I hear you and Neil and John and Ron and all these guys, these legends and Cobra tell stories about, oh, that was this day when we were in this country and this day when we were in the country and this happened and there's a story for everything. And when I'm coming up and I'm looking into these guys, it's like, I've always had a strong appreciation for history as it pertains to sports.
Paul Linn: So I'm not a fan of people, but I respect the history and the path. And hearing those stories just made me a little, uh, you know, jealous and envious at the time. Like I want to write my stories too. I want to go to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Been there. And I'm old, you know, I'm 41 years old. So a lot of these guys were doing this at a time. Had I known about arm wrestling that I could have been participating. So it kills me. I'm like, I missed, you know, 35 years that I could have been competing.
Engin Terzi: but now you are being part of something that will be unforgettable and it will go down to history some like maybe the great and then you are part of that team this one specifically is really special so i'm just thankful to be a part of it but i'll come in my best yeah yeah yeah anyways there are super chad alex and i donated the 150 for sign poster and thank you my friend you will receive an uh
Engin Terzi: Stoyan Bumbalov- A email when it's near to do event, and you will give your address to different email that we will ask you to send and then you will receive in here once again, this is not paper, but this is going to be a very high quality poster you know we will it will very nice. Stoyan Bumbalov- Everyone, including level one and. Stoyan Bumbalov- Dennis will. Stoyan Bumbalov- sign.
Engin Terzi: and let's see if there's another super chat and then i will ask to irakli okay exactly exactly what do you think what do you think about the level of the competition that you are going to participate
İrakli Gamtenadze: I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
İrakli Gamtenadze: I was very surprised and I thought that this was going to be a big success. And that's how it happened. I was interested in the new team and the new team, and I wanted to compete with the well-known sportsmen. I took part in this competition, and I was very happy to be able to participate in this large-scale competition.
Roman (Translator): so uh since he's been in this industry in this sport he has never competed at such a high level as it is east versus west engine and he said also that it's quite surprising how often you manage to pull off
Roman (Translator): uh like uh every year such a high level matches and such high level events like he said that this fifth event came so quickly right now like he says every season like uh summer autumn winter and stuff right so he's very thankful about that he also said that it's very good for newer generations or not only just the older arm wrestlers who are already involved uh decades and decades in this sport but also on you guys
Roman (Translator): And he even said that it was like the time when you started to set up this East versus West event as it is, it was like a sport was kind of sleepy mode, right? Like because of COVID, I guess also he, I guess he meant that too. So yeah, it's really good. It's really high level and he's very surprised, but also very excited that this event takes place every year, every season.
Engin Terzi: yeah see whenever if you ask the people they will say that 95 of the people say that best food that they eat is their mother's food it's because a lot of love is involved with this so the reason that i'm doing all this trust me it's all love all love as long as i don't lose money i love it i enjoy it so much i get up with so much
Engin Terzi: pain in my head i thought i'm gonna have brain bleeding and i said i cannot survive you know then i continue and then the day is not enough because i i do that this i mean i'm not going to tell everything here but i'm doing a lot of things but i love it if i didn't love i wasn't really seriously it's no good for my health you know but i love it i love it and whenever i see that people are all great job in great job in it i'm like okay
Engin Terzi: know that i made the community happy and then these people are not normal people these people are the people that shares the same love and passion that like everyone i know what paul is doing when he's getting ready i know how he's feeling how he's excited i know directly i have been there you know and i mean i'm happy i i kind of feel that it's necessary to do this understand the community needed
Roman (Translator): Yes, so that's why I do and tell lrakli that I'm also very honored that he's also participating in our events. lrakli, thank you very much. I'm very happy to have you here. I'm very happy to have you here. I'm very happy to have you here. I'm very happy to have you here. I'm very happy to have you here.
Roman (Translator): that it was very important and it was my responsibility to make sure that I was able to do what I wanted.
İrakli Gamtenadze: Thank you very much.
Roman (Translator): so he said that uh likewise angie thank you for giving the opportunity and uh which is the all the best to you to keep up the good work and he also says that like uh when you mentioned the uh your love about towards this sport he said like
Roman (Translator): Everyone in this sport, whoever is interested in this sport, you are the most interested. You are the guy who has the most love. He also mentioned even more than John Brzenk. He thinks that you are the guy who loves this sport even more than John Brzenk. So he mentioned that your love is really evidential. Everyone sees that.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I mean, this is, this is the, I owe this to come. I owe, I feel grateful that that is why I am inviting Gary Goodrich. I'm inviting Zaur. I'm inviting Sharon Ermes. I'm inviting Cobra Rose, Haydar Gildil. I even asked to Dave Patton, you know, and the same Richard Lobkus I asked, you know, they were not available. I will ask to Ellen Fisher as well, you know, so that, that is being grateful because,
Engin Terzi: they can't be, oh, once they were good, now we forgot. No, no, no. We need to remember these people. And then later, we will also remember Pauline, even maybe after they quit, that we will say, okay, these guys were
Engin Terzi: are legends so let's remember them too that is good to be you know grateful it's not like everything is getting so much like use on throw away you know everything the food is becoming fast food everything is just used and forget used and forget this life i i'm not there but i'm old-fashioned guy i like to remember the past guys who inspired us you know anyway so
Paul Linn: I think from the athlete's perspective, we appreciate that more than you're knowing. And I know sometimes people criticize things it's not even worth thinking about. Because from our perspective, with all the other leagues and opportunities that there are out there, a lot of times it's just business and you know it's just business. So for that reason, you don't have as much loyalty to the organization. But I feel like from the puller's perspective, I know personally,
Paul Linn: i am loyal to your organization um if you're doing anything i would always be honored to be involved in that and i'll do my best to make myself available for that over other opportunities that may you know may have other things tied to them uh i think that a lot of arm wrestlers are loyal um whether they say it or not and would gladly support everything you do because i think we know i think as a whole we all know that it's coming from a good place
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah but i also feel the same i see your support i see that how much you support me and i know you know my intention so trust me it is both ways i also appreciate what you guys are doing by
Engin Terzi: except in my UI coming there and we all together writing history. Trust me, it is not Engin Terzi's event. It is Engin Terzi's athletes in the community who are supporting. Some may not have the money to support by buying paper. It's okay. You know, I'm just against those, those,
Engin Terzi: uh pirates three minutes it is bad it's harming everything it's harming the athletes because more we make you know income then i can also pay athletes more it is not that these athletes are making super super money or something you know some athletes very popular they are making you know okay money but as as a support
Engin Terzi: support we should be making much more money so that that is they nobody should think that if we buy more pay-per-view england is going to become rich no hanging is going to be paying these athletes more i'm already slowly slowly slowly i'm already paying more so that because this is what they this is not what they deserve they deserve 10 times more than this is minimum minimum but
Engin Terzi: we are not at that level yet so let's grow together say no to those pirate piracy streaming it's no good if you don't have money i understand when you say you know good job engine i'm more than happy for that but just wait two days three days four days whatever and then watch i also put on youtube but i cannot right away i cannot cover the event
Paul Linn: I think from an arm wrestler's perspective, you care at all about the sport. If you compete at all, if you ever compete, if you ever have, you should be purchasing these pay-per-views, even if you don't watch them live. Sometimes it doesn't marry up with your time. But I buy every single one just to support and then rewatch it when I have time. I think it's so important.
Paul Linn: there's only so many avenues that we can support the growth of the sport and why would you not want to support through a few dollars here or there the purest promotion that we probably have had out there in as long as i can remember so i think i think it is on the the fan and and the arm wrestler it is on them that they should purchase if at all if at all possible but if you can't financially it comes out on youtube for free so i mean just gotta wait a couple days yeah
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway so i mean guys like there was a injury with jerry i replaced with dave chefy injury with michael todd i replaced with devon i don't go like you know oh what to do you know maybe we cancel this match i try to give you know something as good as the the the replacement you understand like the same um so
Engin Terzi: Let's do all together. Anyway, so let's forget about this one. And we can talk about the other matches and predictions, you know. And okay, let's start, Paul, with you. Paul, the first one. It's a tough one. And I want your 100% honest opinion. Pauline versus lrakli Gamtenadze. 50-50.
Paul Linn: It's such a nice guy. I tell everybody like the state Kings thing is awesome, but I tell all my friends, do not bet on me. I don't want that pressure. I don't want that stress. Devon't bet on me. So it is not because you are such a nice guy, but it's really how you feel 50, 50. So from a competitor's perspective,
Paul Linn: um i've throughout my my process in sports i've learned that it's invaluable to to respect your opponent um if there is ever a time where you're overconfident your training will slip your mental game will slip so i don't ever come into a match believing that that i am a favorite
Paul Linn: Whether I am or not, I need to tell myself that I must be better, I must be stronger, I must be on my game on the day of competition. So if I tell myself that, hey, I should win this or whatever, then I'm going to lose my edge. So I choose to, at all times, be the underdog if at all possible. I understand. OK. And lrakli, how do you see that match in percentage?
Roman (Translator): He said 80 to 20% and then I asked 80 for who and he laughed. So I guess 80 for him and 20 for Paul. Okay, so he's good. See, that's what Paul wanted, yeah. Okay, say, go ahead.
Roman (Translator): He said that whenever he knows his upcoming opponent, he 100% is sure he has two options. Either he wins or he loses, but he 100% knows if he loses or if he wins. That's what he wanted to say.
İrakli Gamtenadze: For example, in the European Championship in 2016, Prudnik was in my team. Evgeny Prudnik, Yanderson, Karayev, Filipov, all of them were in the same team. They were all in the same team, but Prudnik was the only one in the team. Prudnik was the only one in the team. Prudnik was the only one in the team. Prudnik was the only one in the team.
İrakli Gamtenadze: After that, the idea was put into practice, and Prudnik was very successful. If he had won, he would have been the European champion. He would have been able to win, but that's how it was. He was able to beat Prudnik, and after that, he was able to become the European champion. All the other teams, no matter how they look at it, no matter how they look at it, no matter what they do,
Roman (Translator): So he said, like I already mentioned, like he's most likely 100% sure whether he's going to win or not against his opponent. And then he started like to give us some example. So his example was about European Championship 2016.
Roman (Translator): And it was an example of Prudnik. So he said that he wished not to pull Prudnik because anytime he pulls Prudnik, he gets exhausted and it really affects on his physical capabilities for upcoming matches during the tournament. So there was also other people like Filipov, Makayev and every other. And Prudnik has lost to some. One of Prudnik's pull at the tournament, he saw that Prudnik lost.
Roman (Translator): and then he was sure if prudnik would lose the second one too during this tournament he would be european championship and it happened so and then he became european champion so that was like 2016 one of the example he wanted to say about why he feels usually it's at least 90 he's sure when he has opponent he knows either he's gonna beat or he's gonna lose and hanging for you he said that this time he knows he's gonna beat paul yeah he's gonna what he's gonna beat paul
Engin Terzi: oh he's gonna beat paul oh okay okay i will ask him a question but short answer ivan short answer when we when we have a chat with zurab he puts a shirt and his leg size arms you know like this and now uh we see iraqi with the jacket and everything is he trying to not to scare paul
Roman (Translator): Thank you very much, Mr. Basuhio. We are very happy to have you here with us today. We are very happy to have you here today. We are very happy to have you here today.
İrakli Gamtenadze: He said that there is no way his muscles are going to scare Paul in. There is no way. It's just the jacket is because it's cold outside there. But he could flex if you want. His forearm was so big, you know? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: anyway so i will tell you something whenever he he takes somebody's wrist there you go there you go oh yeah it looks big oh yeah yeah yeah there you go there you go okay okay now now paul is gonna tell us paul is 40 percent that that forearm is good another another question quick yeah is he in the shape
Roman (Translator): or even better shape than when he won the world championships right now? He changed his training regime and also he changed the style when he pulls. Yeah, so he is now even stronger shape than when he won worlds. So if he pulls this directly,
Roman (Translator): Paul is being in the best shape of lrakli, correct? Exactly, correct. Wow. Another thing I want to ask him quickly, and then I will ask Paul. Whenever lrakli takes somebody's wrist, he's making a sound with like a whistling. Can you tell him to do that?
Engin Terzi: he was doing like this whenever he takes somebody's wrist or he's gonna pull someone and i said you cannot beat that guy and then he said no his wrist is weak and he goes like
Roman (Translator): He does something like this. Yeah, he remembers, but I don't know why he's not doing it. Do like this. Do it. Do it.
Roman (Translator): he said it's it's kind of rare when he does this position usually he's going kind of inside yeah but whenever whenever he he wants to prove i mean i show the point that you know his opponent is a weak wrist he was making a sound you know i'm gonna cancel his match you know if he doesn't
Engin Terzi: I'm trying to persuade him. No, no, he says no. I guess that's a secret weapon, I guess. I don't know. And Paul, how do you see Samushia versus Daniel Prokopchuk? You saw Daniel versus Corey Miller and then you pulled Samushia. How do you see that match? I have no idea.
Paul Linn: have samusha as a head in favor um i i train with uh go gogo ubi lava uh from georgia and he he always speaks extremely highly of the v um and you know saying that you know now that he's had two three matches underneath his belt he's very soon going to be unbeatable i mean and just knowing what samusha feels like i have him as a heavy favor i understand guys um the the
Engin Terzi: As T-shirt didn't include pay-per-view, the poster doesn't include pay-per-view, my friend. Pay-per-view is so confusing. Last week, some people said they received. Some people said they don't receive. You understand? So we excluded from now on pay-per-views only from the core sports. Yeah. And I have a question for him. He's from Georgii. Probably he's going to say that Samushia is going to beat Daniel. But can you tell him, if he can tell us, is he...
İrakli Gamtenadze: Stronger than Samushia or not? I think Daniel is stronger than Samushia. I think Daniel is stronger than Samushia.
Roman (Translator): Yeah. So Engin, he first wanted to say his opinion about this match. Then I will ask you a question. He said that considering how Daniel competed last time we saw, he says that it will not be good enough for Samushia. So he thinks Samushia is also a favorite here. And he also said Daniel's left hand is better than Daniel's right.
Roman (Translator): That's what he said. So now I will ask you a question.
İrakli Gamtenadze: You will understand from his answer. Understand that he is better than Samushia.
Roman (Translator): uh okay i would translate he did not say 50 50 but yeah so he said that uh samushia is obviously lighter weight than he is okay that's enough it means yeah so and plus plus they they don't train in the same city he is in thailand samusha is from from goga's goga's hometown yes yes
Roman (Translator): Yeah, Zurab, Batumi. It's another city in Tbilisi. Zurab is also not with other Georgii. How close? You asked about how close they are. Similar way. And you said Zurab is close to you, right? Because there are no other cities that are close to you, right? Zurab is close to you and Iraq is close to you. What do you think about it? Is it interesting? No, it's not.
İrakli Gamtenadze: Zurab is a very good player. He is very good at sparring, he is very good at Zurab. Zurab is a very good player. He is very good at sparring, he is very good at sparring, he is very good at sparring.
Roman (Translator): Okay. So he said that they are in the same city, like you said, Paul. And so they get to train with each other quite a lot. And he said that right now we were just with each other like several hours ago or so.
Roman (Translator): And they train like they have friendly sparring as well, because they try not to injure themselves, especially when competition is coming. So he also said that a couple of times I have won, a couple of times he can beat me. So it's yeah, they don't really 100% go against each other. Tell him that must mean I have to top roll. Yeah, I know. I know. Should not come back. I don't see.
İrakli Gamtenadze: Yeah, it's only this position against Zurab. Not my position. Right. So I guess that means that Zurab is going to beat Brian Bowen easily, right? Sorry, I was reading your comment. What he understood is
Roman (Translator): iraqi thinks that zurab is gonna beat ryan bowen easily yeah he's he's agreeing to it like yeah yeah yeah and what's your opinion oh man ryan bowen's hard to predict you know what i mean
Paul Linn: He gained 13 kilograms, 14 kilograms for the match. 17, whatever. Yeah, he's huge. He gained all that weight. So it's very tricky to go off of Ryan and Coach Ray. I think Ryan's version is totally different.
Paul Linn: i've pulled ryan before but i've not pulled the you know 100 or you know 235 pound version of him so i don't know i do think ryan has a tricky style he's got that proficient low hand top roll and if he got his back pressure any tighter um there could be a lane where it's a tough match but i have zara i have zara uh as a favorite as well and i know i know buddhist sorry
İrakli Gamtenadze: I don't know if it's true or not, but I'm telling you the truth. When Zurab was killed and the Americans were killed, it was the same thing. It was the same thing that Samushia was killed and Tauber was killed.
Roman (Translator): yeah uh it uh it doesn't matter if georgians are competing uh unnecessarily against uh any western guys or for example any eastern guys to western guys he keeps to be objective and it's he really feels and thinks that both is robinson she's gonna win so that's why he's uh we are like more than one hour and we need to talk about some other matches as well so okay let's go
Engin Terzi: He knows them, he knows them, but probably he doesn't know much about Kalinichenko. But lrakli, how do you see Kalinichenko versus Dzeranov, right arm? Yeah, Kalinichenko, Dzeranov. Right? Yes. Right. Right, right, yeah. Dzeranov, Dzeranov. Dzeranov, he says, yeah. Dzeranov. And Paul, do you have any? I don't know. I don't know.
Engin Terzi: enough to really um to pick a favorite but i'm most of what i'm hearing uh the folks that i talk to they're saying and and and what what wagner versus uh designer left arm wagner bortolato 50 50 i think 50 50.
İrakli Gamtenadze: Wagner was strong. He was in the same position as Levan Motoneli. He was in the same position as me. He was in the same position as me. He was in the same position as me. He was in the same position as me. He was in the same position as me. He was in the same position as me. He was in the same position as me. He was in the same position as me.
İrakli Gamtenadze: I'm happy to be in this position.
Roman (Translator): So he said that one of his students was pretty easily able to control Dzeranov's right arm. And he also said that he thinks Dzeranov's left is better than Dzeranov's right arm. But despite the fact, he thinks Wagner will maintain his position against Dzeranov. So maybe slight favorite, he thinks Wagner in this case on left hand. So he is thinking close match, but a little bit edge to Wagner.
Paul Linn: Yes, yes. Paul, do you have any idea? Again, I'm not totally sure, but I love Wagner. Yeah, I love him. I don't know if he's going to win, but I'm going to be cheering hard for him. I understand, yeah. Anyway, so let's go more. Bozhidar versus Adam. Paul.
Paul Linn: Yes, it's a good match. It's a real test, right? So I'm not going to just blindly say that Adam is going to win because I know Bozhidar's level. So I think it's really a coming out party for Adam.
Paul Linn: So if Adam can make that match competitive, he can stop it and turn it into a grinder. I don't know which way it's going to go. But I do respect Adam's level. He, you know, and you and I talked about that match. And I do think it's a really, really interesting stylistic matchup. I think it could go either way.
Paul Linn: But at the end of the day, we're going to learn something for sure about Adam and Bozy. I'll be supporting Adam just because he's from the West. But I like Bojadar too. So this one is like, man, I have no idea. It could go either way. And it could be really one-sided one way or the other, or it could be a war. And I think it's probably going to be a war. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Engin Terzi: I mean, I'm also thinking like Bozhidar is not a flash pinner as long as the opponent is not a top roller. Usually whenever he goes inside, he has some match, you know, Bozhidar. And Adam is strong inside. And then when the match stops, I heard he is incredible. They call him mini Devon, not mini, but maybe mid-Devon about his endurance, you know. And I'm kind of thinking that that match is going to,
Paul Linn: like two minute match or something you know i mean i'm expecting you know right i feel like i feel like bojadar would need to like pin him on the first or second surge like if it's not on the first or second surge it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna be a grinder
İrakli Gamtenadze: When Murad Boyraz was in Istanbul, he came to Kashchei and spoke to Kashchei.
Roman (Translator): uh there was a speaking of post that he just uh remembered something so he he competed against kashevsky uh it was uh event in turkai uh and he said that he pretty dominantly beat kashevsky there yeah yes so and and do you do you know who is adam worzinski iraqi
Engin Terzi: adam borzinski that's the guy uh he's not familiar yeah there is there is there is some conversation about the population
İrakli Gamtenadze: not sure if i super agree i mean then if china chinese guy starts arm wrestling i think you are thinking that uh
Roman (Translator): yeah he he he just wanted to uh make make sure that i translated to you and paul too so he really easily beat the chef ski there i i understand that yeah yeah anyway so let's go to the uh another match uh exactly uh cobra haidar
İrakli Gamtenadze: Both are old. One is 58 years old, one is 56 years old. They both are not... Haydar will win, I think. You think? I think Haydar will win in the final. Murat Boyraz will be in the final. I don't know if he will win.
Roman (Translator): He wants to ask you, Engin, this competition at Mura's... Yeah, so this Haydar was against... In the final, Haydar was against Gaszewski or someone else? He wanted to remember that fact, like when Haydar was in the final. I remember Haydar defeated Gaszewski there, but I don't remember what placement match it was. I have no idea.
İrakli Gamtenadze: Gachevsky had no idea that the final was going to be a tough one, right? The first two rounds were tough. Gachevsky and Gilder were tough. Gilder was a tough opponent. He was a tough opponent. He was a tough opponent. He was a tough opponent. He was a tough opponent. He was a tough opponent. He was a tough opponent. He was a tough opponent.
Roman (Translator): yeah so he said that it was really tough match between those two guys it was the first uh murad boyer's event and uh there was also uh with fuya samkaradze georgian guy and they they were all into this match it was quite tough final about um uh this uh final when he uh started to say he's talking about heider and vectia samkarazza final no no no uh hyder and this uh gashevsky yeah he said that it was close match
Engin Terzi: Yeah, it was, yeah. Anyways, Paul, you probably don't know Haydar. I know a little bit, just internet research since the match was set. So it does sound like Haydar has been competitive recently at a pretty high level. And I know Cobra's been... Two months training, and then he come to the Grandmasters. He didn't even compete the qualification of the Turkish Nationals. There was an empty spot, and he just came. But this guy is three times Senior World Champion. You know, he had
Engin Terzi: Big wins, you know, against big guys in the past. But this level of the grandmasters, no disrespect, is nothing like this level. Right. And I know, I know.
Paul Linn: um cobra hasn't been really active at all over the past couple years but he has started to get dug back into the arm wrestling community for sure and i love the guy so uh you can't underestimate the temp you know he's uh he's coming in hot for sure he's training he tells me two years ago they they were in the final hyder uh cobra beat him hyder was second silver silver medalist and cobra was first and since then i they never met you know and other than that
Engin Terzi: what do we have what do we have what do we have um what do you guys think about uh oleg petrenko and zurab left arm oleg petrenko i saw him they said they are one one with left arm yeah the same year 2018 one of them win at the europeans against the other one in the at the waft the other guy won and i think and they say this as far as i remember and also
Engin Terzi: I saw Petrenko in the Zloty Tur 2019. In the final, I saw him beating Tadikian. Yeah, with left arm. So he was 95 kilo Petrenko. Now he is 105 kilo Petrenko. He says he is 30% stronger than their shape by his lifting numbers, he says.
Engin Terzi: he doesn't know at the table but whatever he was lifting three years ago he said now he's lifting 30 but he's because so young guy so it is possible you know how do you see that match left arm I will I will ask first iraqi if I may yeah
Roman (Translator): So, Anu, first of all, thank you for being a part of the show with me. And as you know, Petrenko is the director of this film, but I would like to say that in each of these films, Zurab plays a role, Petrenko plays a role, and all of Petrenko's works, including this one, play a role in the final. And I hope you will be interested in these two films.
İrakli Gamtenadze: Petrenko was born in the year 2000. He was born in the year 2000. He was born in the year 2000. He was born in the year 2000. He was born in the year 2000.
Roman (Translator): Yeah, so he said that Petrenko is really good on both arms and he's upgraded since the last time he competed and because he follows him quite close enough. And this time he would say he was not that sure, but he would say 60 to 40 for Petrenko against Zurab. Today he was doing 100 kilos, 220 pounds of bicep curls.
Roman (Translator): sitting yeah he said petrenko is universal like a very versatile armistice
Paul Linn: I think if what Oleg's saying is true based on his form right now, he's probably the favorite. And due to the fact that he can do more than one thing, it's not going to just wind up in a slow hook. I would probably put him as a favorite. But I'm supporting Zurab. Because you know the guy, right? Yeah, I like him. I like the Georgii guys. And Paul. Thank you, Paul. Paul, do you think that...
Engin Terzi: The match, because it will be before John Brzing match, the match between Petrenko and Zurab, the way it goes, since we know Zurab, and we don't know much about Petrenko last few years, not much, you know, he pulled some super match, but other than that, we haven't seen his recent form. Do you think that it is going to give us some idea about the outcome of John Brzing and Petrenko?
Engin Terzi: Like, if he goes like this with Zurab, or if he goes through Zurab, or if he just loses Zurab right away, do you think this guy, because the guy has good right and left, do you think that it's going to give us some idea about how he plays?
Paul Linn: It's not a great position to be in when you're pulling the goat and you have another match. So if anything goes wrong in that match, if John can learn anything in that match, if momentum, like if Oleg doesn't perform well against Zarev, that'll create something mentally. Evgeny if he does perform well, I think it gives John a little bit of data.
Paul Linn: I think it's tough to have to pull, let's say a first match before you go and pull the one that you're probably focusing a little bit more on. So that's not a position that I'm envious of at all. I think it does give John slight advantage data wise. But if he goes through,
Paul Linn: then do you think that mentally he will get any tougher for John too? Yeah, I mean, if he wins that match 3-0 with no struggle at all, then that'll generate momentum for him. But it's an added variable, though. It could go either way. Depending on how it goes, it could be a good or bad thing. And I think it's an added bonus for John as long as Oleg doesn't go 3-0. Boom, boom, boom.
Paul Linn: that's the scenario where we give oliga an advantage anything else i think would give john an advantage and paul math mask and sandras
Paul Linn: You know what? That's a weird one. Matt is looking crazy strong. And the word amongst the community right now is in a top level form in his career. So I do think that he has to be in that form to be able to compete with Sandris. I don't think that the last version of Matt that we saw in East versus West would have been ready for Sandris because I have a whole lot of respect for Sandris.
Paul Linn: but i'm i'm i'm rooting for matt and and i do believe based off everything that we're seeing and just kind of his swag and energy right now that he's in great form so i i think i think matt wins it but it's still a tough one to pick so you are saying matt is gonna win i i am i am supporting him i and i do i do think he has a strong possibility to win okay and and and electric yes
İrakli Gamtenadze: Yes, that's right. I think it's 50-50. If you look at my position, I think it's 50-50.
Roman (Translator): So he's saying that it's 50-50. He's really not like a one-sided chore in this case. He doesn't think that it's going to be a dominant match from either side. So 50-50. And then he also said if Matt Mask is able to take the center from Sandris, then it should be Matt's battle.
Engin Terzi: I would say, I'm not going to give my opinion. This is so confusing. I saw Sandris said, wow, incredible. I see Matt's form, incredible. I don't know whether this is going to happen. Evgeny if I had the opinion, I wouldn't say. But the Matt that I saw in May had no chance against Sandris today. But the Matt that I see today is something different. So we will see. Anyways, so how about Revaz and Morozov?
Roman (Translator): Whenever I ask you these matches, your first reaction? Yeah, I don't know. They're good matches. They're hard to predict. I don't think they're going to happen. The reason is . So, I mean. I asked him to fix the sound. It was . Yeah, he fixed. It's good to go. But it was.
Roman (Translator): He said Revaz. 100% Revaz. He's saying making sure that Revaz is also heavier than Omarozo in this match, right? Yeah, definitely. I think Revaz is 140kg or so. Revaz. Yeah, he's saying Revaz.
Paul Linn: And Paul, we couldn't hear what you said. Yeah, I mean, I have like the utmost respect for Morozov because after seeing him in person, I realized the guy is like, you know, Dolph Lundgren from Rocky. He's unbelievably big. And then to see him the way he competed against Dave Chaffee, I would never underestimate that guy. But everything that I'm hearing from the Georgii guys is that Rivas is so close.
Paul Linn: to Gennady and just getting to that level where he could be. So I could understand why lrakli would say that and I hesitate to question him because they train together so he probably knows something that we don't know. Is it only about what he knows or also is it something about where he is from?
Paul Linn: it's a combination we can't help nepotism yeah yeah yeah but ravaz is incredibly uh impressive and you know from talking to ewing and when he was saying like i i came in i was only 60 or whatever he said he was you know first he was 40 and then 60 he says now he's coming with 80 percent so he believes that his shape according to him is twice good compared to michael match he says right yes that's the case man
Engin Terzi: And lrakli, how about John Brzing and Petrenko? Petrenko. Petrenko? Yeah. I don't think Paul will say that. Never underestimate each other. I think Ungarbaev is not strong. I think. Ungarbaev is not... Listen, listen, listen. Once, once I beat Sasho as well, you know.
Engin Terzi: But he was very young, you know, so I wouldn't go like... I think Sasho strong or Ongarbaev. No, no, the things are changing. Justin because you beat him once upon a time, it doesn't change. I beat Sasho. He was a young, very young guy. I was in terrible shape, beat him. Now... I think Sasho and Ongarbaev. Pulling against Sasho hurts my elbow, you know. No, he also said... Sasho 19 kilos, Ongarbaev 100 kilos. 100 kilos, Andreu...
Engin Terzi: uh one hundred percent win i'm not talking about sasha compared and on that but just because you remember someone from the past he was not that strong it doesn't mean that he is not strong anymore you know did you not say his mouth he beat kurdecha yes yes
İrakli Gamtenadze: But he also said it's worth mentioning that Kudecha since then is a different breed today. Evgeny then he was strong. When Ongarbae beat him, a year before Kudecha beat Revaz at the Moldova event. He beat Gennady in Moldova. He beat Gennady in Moldova event as well. I will tell you.
Roman (Translator): In Antalya, 2018 was it, he said when it was WAF World Championship, 100 kg Motonelze win like a competition, not even kindergarten. That's what he wanted to say.
İrakli Gamtenadze: Yes. It's true, it's true, but there is no such thing as a person who thinks that he is a person. If he is not a person, then he is not a person, he is a person. Then the position is that he is a person, and if he is not a person, then he is a person. That's what I think.
Roman (Translator): so he doesn't take any credits from ongobaev he says ongobaev is crazy strong guy but uh uh he's talking about his match against uh brzenk so last uh east versus west uh brzenk such a dominantly won first match first round it was either brzenk did not uh correctly estimated uh ongobaev or something went really uh wrong when he
Engin Terzi: lost the wrist when present glossaries then it was on goodbye's match all day so something has to happen bad to present he doesn't think that the first round said something happened I'm not saying that first round something happened or the second round something happened but this is super much
Engin Terzi: So if we go that way, somebody may say, Ongarbaev may say, oh, this happened on the first round, that's why I lost. And then John may say, this happened, so we can't go that way. That match, they pull, they will pull again, and then when John, if John wins, then Ongarbaev will not have any excuse. But, you know. Ongarbaev is a very talented sports fan. If he were in this position, he would have won the whole year. He would have won the whole year.
İrakli Gamtenadze: There is no mention of Brzozola. How did he get to Brzozola?
Roman (Translator): He just wants to share his opinion about this battle between Brzenk and Ongrubaev. He says Ongrubaev is a very endurable guy, endurable armwrestler. As long as he can maintain his center, he can armwrestle the whole day. And once Brzenk lost his wrist, lrakli thinks that Brzenk should have just let the pain go. Yes, but I mean, this reason, that reason, we can't take it from Ongrubaev. If you guys just want a match, we cannot say, oh, you are weak, you won't buy.
Roman (Translator): mistake or chance or you were lucky or something you cannot say hey directly can you meet on that way now he thinks he can beat him yeah
Paul Linn: It's sure that Motonelize will beat Kidur Ghali for sure. Never underestimate the GOAT. Never underestimate John. I think that the Angrabayev match was a stylistic problem for John. Evgeny Devon and I were talking right before the match happened.
Paul Linn: And both of us said we're in a mind state of this is going to be John's toughest opponent stylistically based off of the components that he's still working on. So I think Andrabayev has the most pristine top role in that class, the best post, high knuckle position, which has shown to be a slight vulnerability during John's combat.
Engin Terzi: so if if petrinko cannot emulate that exact style i feel as though john has the tools to be able to work around i understand you anyway so we will see we will see you know um and another one we can go hermes versus uh morozo left arm hermes he thinks yeah hermes is gonna beat morozo
Paul Linn: I don't know. Paul, you know how strong Cody Meredith is, and you have seen him with Morozov, and then it is hard to underestimate him, right? Yeah, how can you? Lever length, frame, how young he is. And correct me if I'm wrong, Morozov's left potentially better than his right, right?
Paul Linn: very close? Yeah, I think yes. Yeah. And earnings is left is nowhere near his right. Correct. And probably I can say that 80 85% of his right my opinion. Right? Yeah. I mean, I have a hard time not rooting for Morozov. I think the guys I think the guys like, um,
Paul Linn: like the rising star like aesthetically and he's got a good personality he's got good charisma i mean it's a really interesting match because they both do uh but i feel like morozov just has the general skill set like anatomically um to continue to get better so i feel like every time we see that guy he's going to be a little bit better a little bit better i have yes yeah but like
Engin Terzi: I mean, I agree that, you know, we see him every time a little bit better, but as you said, a little bit better. Because it is hard to be competitive all year long and then go up like this much, you know. Yeah. While Revaz, he never pushed his capacity, you understand, his potential limits. I think he's going up faster, faster than Morozov. Evgeny he's older because he has a lot of room to
Engin Terzi: field it's my opinion and so let's go let's go dave chaffee versus ermes directly you don't have an analyzing i am sitting in such a great match and you all you say is maybe he has already i know i know any any any any like analyzing
Engin Terzi: I was telling him about Ungarbe. I'm not arguing with him. He's my brother. We are just discussing.
Roman (Translator): I'll make sure he gets that.
İrakli Gamtenadze: Yes, that's what I meant. I mean, for example, the current state of affairs, as you said, the current state of affairs in the United States, with all these changes, with the changes in the education system, with the changes in the education system, it's all the same. It's the same in every form, but in the history of education, in the education system, it's the same. And as I said, I'm not going to go into details.
Roman (Translator): so um he wanted this to translate before he tells his opinion about uh and dave uh anu so that's all this um dialogue between this discussion like you just mentioned about uh kidrigali and uh and other names that he mentioned it's not only about current form he comes with this conclusion from
Roman (Translator): monitoring these people these armistice yeah exactly like in dynamics where they were where they are coming from and where are they currently so that's why it happened and now he wants to also yeah yeah i understand that but just tell him also that things sometimes change so quickly because of some reasons and then the prudnik of top eight and prudnik of today
Roman (Translator): Yes, yes.
İrakli Gamtenadze: Gasparini is very talented, I think. He can be the first to win, or at most the second to win, but I think he is not the only one to win. He is very talented, very technical, and he is very good at everything. He is very good at everything, and he is very good at direction.
İrakli Gamtenadze: But I didn't have any experience in this field. I didn't have any experience in this field. I didn't have any experience in this field.
Roman (Translator): So now he analyzed this Ermes versus Dave Chaffee. And he said that if any, Ermes may lose only one round. He doesn't think that Ermes will lose any more rounds. So he thinks, I guess, best shot for Dave is first round. He also said that Ermes is more technical, more versatile, more endurable as well. And then he also said that Dave Chaffee round number one and Dave Chaffee round number three are different rounds.
Roman (Translator): Yeah, but in Dubai, Dave Chaffee was number four, round seven was not bad either. I think that if he had not been vaccinated, he would not have been able to go to Latin America.
Roman (Translator): He thinks that, yes, he saw obviously that match and he believes that Laletin was not in his best form in that match. Yeah. Yeah, so he said that Dave Chaffee maintaining his form while Ermes, every time we see Ermes, he brings better and better and heavier weights himself. So better version of Ermes we're going to see. So that's where he's coming from in this case. And...
Paul Linn: So I think Dave's activity as of late lends itself for me to favor him. And just communicating with him a little bit, seeing his podcast and stuff, his head seems to be in the right place. And when Dave is focused, he's an incredible monster. And I'm not sure that Ernie's has faced anyone yet with that level of side pressure and sheer power.
Paul Linn: I do agree with Rackley in that, you know, as the later rounds come into play, that can be detrimental to Dave. But like we said, you know, if he's now gotten comfortable with losing his wrist and being able to flop wrist press, I think that's a whole other weapon in his arsenal now. So I think there's a possibility that if it goes to the late rounds, we could see it and we could see it in a similar place than the Valley matches.
Paul Linn: But I'm favoring Dave for sure. I like where his head's at. I like where his energy is. And I think that's a big part of his game. His mind's right. He's unbelievable. You both are from the same state? Yes, but very far away. It's a large state. We're like six hours away. If it was close, you guys would train together. I would love to. I would love to. He trains with Bart Wood and James Wagner and those guys. It's way up in the corner of the state.
Engin Terzi: You two probably are the most friendly, kind person in the community. I try my best to live up to the standard that he set. To me, that's how competitors should be. Okay, so let's come to the subject. Devon Lara and Evgeny Prudnik. lrakli, if you just say one word and then stop your answer. Justin say it.
Roman (Translator): OK, now you gave even longer.
İrakli Gamtenadze: Normally you were saying only Ermes, now you say, I think Devon Larratt, so it's long enough. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I think that Devon's name is mentioned in the book. And it's written in Greek, in Greek, and it's written in Greek, and it's written in Greek, and it's written in Greek, and it's written in Greek, and it's written in Greek, and it's written in Greek,
İrakli Gamtenadze: If you look at Devon, you can see that he is a very good player. Devon is very good with his opponents, but I think Devon is better with his opponents. I think Devon is better with his opponents. I think Devon is better with his opponents, but I think Devon is better with his opponents.
Roman (Translator): He said that both athletes
Roman (Translator): uh likewise are uh versatile and endurable they both have good endurance but uh speaking of long leverage and the uh length of the forearm devon has uh this type of advantage over prudnik in this case and also he said that other than anthropometric advantages devon also has a weight advantage he said that devon may lose against super heavy weights like over 100 150 kg guys or so
Roman (Translator): But in Prudnik's weight, this weight class he will be pulling with, he thinks that Prudnik will not have enough weight on himself and therefore enough power to pin Devon Larratt. Because bigger guys, super heavyweight guys may pin Devon Larratt, but he thinks Prudnik will not be able to. Yeah, but both will be the same weight. I talk with Prudnik, he's also 115.
Roman (Translator): and both will be 15 kilos. He says that both are versatile and both have good endurance, but there is one advantage Prudnik also has, that he is more explosive. Yes, Prudnik is a very good player, but Prudnik is also a very good player. In general, he is a very good player, but he is also a very good player. Yes, but...
İrakli Gamtenadze: I don't think it's a problem. I think it's a problem with the elders.
Roman (Translator): He thinks that Devon will be attacking Prudnik's wrist rather than Prudnik's arm. So explosiveness may, he agrees on you, obviously, Prudnik is more explosive in this case, but he thinks that Prudnik will have problems in his wrist. And as long as Devon takes over that part, it would be hard for Prudnik. Without the strap, there is any possibility for him to...
Roman (Translator): um he thinks that no way it's it will for sure gonna be in straps they won't will will slip out like they won't like the one he's always doing he's gonna
Engin Terzi: slip this position with thumb they will start with step usually but this is different rules right so yes yes it's different and paul how do you see i'm sure you're going to support devon team west
Paul Linn: yeah i mean i'm i'm supporting him but i genuinely think he's gonna win too um i think that prudnik his explosiveness um could get him a win outside of the straps or maybe a round one or round two win in the straps but i think the minute the match stops if devin's able to stop it with pronation in any way shape or form i think he'll win from there on out and i don't think devin
Paul Linn: would have taken the match if he didn't think he had enough time to be ready or didn't already know enough from their practice pool to be confident. Not that Devon wouldn't have taken it if he wasn't confident, but there's just something that that guy exudes, like the confidence level.
Paul Linn: that I feel like, you know, after talking to him a few months back about coming back down in weight, I think he feels very similar to what lrakli's talking about, where he comes back to that 242 range or whatever it may be, that that may be where he settles in. Yeah. So you are saying that early rounds, Brittany has chance, later, most likely Devon will have the edge? I think we could see one or two early flash pins.
Engin Terzi: from afghani um but i think the minute the match stops it's all devon from there yeah yeah and and lagia um check your uh email to get your signed t-shirt that you want um yeah i understand i understand let's see do you guys follow what's going on on social media between these two
Paul Linn: hold on yeah yeah yeah he knows the phoenix things and stuff paul who's winning i mean the mind games right now it's close no i mean i think i think prudniks are are funny and all in good fun but devin's devin is different when it comes to that stuff he's devin devin can be funny but it's coming from a weird place you know it's like mental warfare stuff
Paul Linn: Yeah, I think Devon's in control of that at all times. But you are saying that Prudnik will be intimidated? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You are saying that for sure Devon will not be intimidated. Yeah.
Paul Linn: Whatever Prudnik's doing is Devon is probably loving. I don't think it's going to affect Devon negatively at all. I think Prudnik's, what he's doing is great for promotion and hyping the matchup, but I don't think it's having any effect on Devon at all. And it might not be in the other direction either, but Devon's just not one of those. You are only giving us guarantee that Devon will not lose that game, but you don't know if he's going to win either, you know, but for sure, the worst case is Ty.
Engin Terzi: yeah or devil means but there is no way that they will lose any mind games not in the mind games but at the end of the day it's all hype and it's all promotion so everybody wants anyway so it has been a long time so let's finish paul thank you very very much my friend it will be an honor probably about 10 days 11 days we will be see you we will see you here and i wish you the best don't get injured take it easy
Engin Terzi: then do your best and exactly thank you very much my friends you also take any don't get injured i can do some replacement matches a month or something three weeks but not 10 days before or two weeks before keep yourself healthy and i wish you guys both the best and thank you roman for helping me
Roman (Translator): Yes, thank you all the time. Yes, thank you. Yes, thank you.
Roman (Translator): Uh, he, uh, says that obviously he's gonna, uh, thanks for the advice. He's gonna take care of himself. We'll be, uh, ready for, uh, Paul. And, uh, he wanted to make sure, uh, when he arrives, will it be in, when we'll be at these weigh-ins like immediately in 16th, 17th, where, where, when will it be? Oh, this, this 18th morning, we are not gonna do 15th, 16th weigh-in. Friday morning, we will do, do weigh-in. Uh, so he'll, he'll, someone looks worried about it.
İrakli Gamtenadze: he got that he know he knows what he said yeah thank you thank you paul thank you thank you guys take care guys take care and see you soon take care paul thank you
