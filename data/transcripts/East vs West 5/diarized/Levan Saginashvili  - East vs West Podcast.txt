Engin Terzi: Which row? East versus West? I don't know. I don't know about the future, my friend. I'm only doing, you know what I'm doing? I'm only organizing, and my goal is to organize, if possible, you know, after a point, I mean, it will not be possible to do better and better and better, maybe same as the, almost same as the last one, but still my goal is to organize a better event than
Engin Terzi: previous ones, and not only as matchups, but also technical issues, you know. So we will see, we will organize, we will see. If you guys support, I will continue. And that's what it is. Thank you Snake.
Engin Terzi: Come on, Ahmet, brother, tell me. Anything I can do can happen. I can't promise without knowing. But you can ask, of course, but I can't say anything for the sake of it. Do a black and tan twice a week, brother. I ask you to do the same thing over and over again. Devon't spam.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, exactly. Yes, Tim. It looks in super shape. Yes. Dave Chaffee will pull Ermes. Jerry hopefully will join us in
SPEAKER_03: Um. Um. What about this colonial?
Engin Terzi: Do I feel stronger? I don't know. I have been ill. I got cold. And we will see. Kardeşim buradan yaptığın her süper şeysin yüzde 30'unu zaten şey alıyor. Bu YouTube alıyor.
Engin Terzi: I cannot tell you my thoughts about Ermes versus Dave. I know it's going to be a tough match. I try not to do prediction, you know, because it's my event. I'm organized. How can I say that this guy will beat that guy or the opposite way? How can I? I mean, what would other people think? What do you think that, you know, people would think, you know, the guys that I invite?
Engin Terzi: If someone else was organizing, it would be easier for me to share opinions. But people are already waiting for an opportunity, you know. Some people, not many people, some 1-2% here and us waiting there. Oh, I think you make a mistake. So we can just go around, you know, spread, you know, lies about him and this and this. So I just try to.
Engin Terzi: I don't know, I'm not a dietitian or something, you know, please. About the digestion, you know, I mean, I think you are in the wrong place. Petrenko versus TAT still on? Possible, possible, but I mean, we will see. Yeah, I saw Bozhidar and Gashevsky. Bozhidar just pulled off only six days before today.
Engin Terzi: And I think it was a mistake for him to pull another event. I don't know about the new opponent of Bruneck. We will see. We will see. I'm still thinking. Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. Hello, Tony. How are you, my friend? It's good. Thank you. And how are you? It's very nice to see you. When Lewan is asking me to send you the link,
Engin Terzi: He says, send the link to the God of the translators. Yeah, it's an honor. Hello to Kosovo.
Engin Terzi: And it means if you have good digestion, then your elbow joints will be strong. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I think there's those. You're right. I'm going to be shaking. So how have you been? I've been good. I've been good. Uh huh.
Tornike (Translator): Mm-hmm. Closely watching with all the drama happening and having fun. Oh, so you're following, huh? Of course. Yeah, yeah, okay. I have not missed one single East vs. West live streaming. Yeah. Do you ever plan to come here? Actually, yeah, why not? With pleasure. It would be good, it would be good, yeah.
Engin Terzi: would be nice to meet you um are you any bigger than last time i saw you slightly i mean your shoulders and everything have you been working out you know yeah i i returned to working out i had a break during the summer and now i'm back okay okay because i see you bigger and everything i mean that's how it should be of course i mean the translator of lebanon can't be skinny come on definitely
Engin Terzi: It's a huge responsibility to carry on the shoulders. What's that? Huge responsibility to carry. Translation for Levan, so I have to keep the shoulders strong. Yeah, but everyone likes you and Levan for sure loves you. Good to hear that. Yeah. No, I'm not... Gerigudric is not going to honor us. He will be our honored guest and he will do some...
Engin Terzi: commentary, commentating for the event. Yep, very soon, I think, Levan is gonna come. So you are in, you are in Estonia? I was, I was. At the moment, I'm in UK. Oh, you're in UK. Okay, okay. Okay. Yeah. I see.
Engin Terzi: And are you arm wrestling or just fan? Some arm wrestling. I'm doing some training, some friendly sparring, but nothing serious. It is Ahmed Burak Atinj. Thank you for your super chat. He says, Tornike, god of the translators. Good to see you, man. Good to see you. Good to see everyone.
Engin Terzi: And what do you think about all the drama that you have been witnessing? You're talking about Devon Brooding, right? Well, everything. It's been crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. First, yeah, Jerry's injury and the change of line-up and now this. Yeah, it's crazy exciting. I mean, people thinking that, you know, sometimes I'm, like, causing trouble or something. I'm not causing trouble. I'm just bringing out their personalities. And I think that...
Engin Terzi: uh community should know more about how these guys feel like then only armless okay armless thing is great but then we need to bring out the personality what they are thinking in fact it is not that they are bringing out something that they don't feel all those are natural i asked sundries this morning i said i mean how do you feel and he's like matt is going down
Engin Terzi: and you know this is not like i i tell him you know to say this or something i really ask him you know and he tells me and then i ask matt he said he's you are going down and he says yes i'm going down as someone i'm going down in history as someone who ruined sandra's year you know which is going to be perfect but will not end good you understand as long as it is not toxic as long as it's not hateful
Engin Terzi: understand it is not like simply disrespectful you understand it's also up to person you know whenever you are hyping the event with devon of course you are a little bit larger you understand because he's also large yeah whenever whenever for example you want to mess with ongar where i mean it is hard to go as much as you go with devon you understand the guy of course so hard to really mess
Engin Terzi: with him, you know, but I'm sure if Devon ever goes against him, because Levan is also very, very, this is a very, very respectful guy. Yeah. Devon even made him. Yeah, that exploded Levan even more. Hello, Levan. Hello. Is it possible to change, turn the sideway, the horn? I in car again. Yeah. How are you, my friend? It's good to see you. Thank you. Good. How are you?
Levan Saginashvili: Good, good, good. I am good, also the goat of the translators is good.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, Levan is saying he flew back to Tbilisi just yesterday and has been running for the errands. So that's why he's in the car. Tomorrow flying again. So yeah, it's been a busy schedule for him. Tell him that almost all the time when Levan is chatting with me, he's in the car.
Tornike (Translator): So one time it was like three hours in the car. Levan's fiance lives in a different city, so he spends time in car quite often. Oh, OK. So wedding is soon, huh? Wedding.
Engin Terzi: Are you going to invite me to your wedding? Of course. Oh, that's my brother. Levan, it's not my fault. Already a provocative question. Silence Master says, Dennis will beat Levan when he is ready. This is a super chat. Any opinion?
Engin Terzi: In the dreams of the Russians, maybe, but in reality, no chance. Yeah. See, this is not disrespectful, but this is pure however he feels. So that is what I am talking about. He didn't say anything disrespectful, but he says he's sure of himself. That's great. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. It is incredible, yeah. And Levan, are you ready to sign 200 t-shirts? He's training specifically for that. It will be harder than beating Larratt. This is...
Engin Terzi: You know, that guy is going to come after you again. His goal is to beat everyone else and he will come back for you. You know that, right? Good luck to him. I'm preparing a health meter pen for him.
Engin Terzi: So, it will be easier for him, you know, because the pen is in his hand. He cannot hold it, you understand? It will be inside of his hand, you know, so that his pen can help me to tell him, please. Kalamsov, do you want to say something in particular? Yes. How was it? How did you feel? How did you feel about the period of the war? How did you feel?
Tornike (Translator): He's asking how the preparation for the event is going. How are you feeling? It is going good, but he probably knows the news that Michael Todd got injured. You know, right? You heard. Michael Todd, you know, . Yeah, he knows. And yeah, it's very unfortunate. Yeah. And we want to .
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I have a message to Todd in DM. So from here, I wish him a quick recovery. Yeah, yeah. And we want, we want Devon. In fact, Devon also wants. Devon wants to come to Istanbul. That is the fact. And his son has some shoulder problem that he can't even arm wrestle.
Engin Terzi: But it just time to time dislocates, the shoulder dislocates. And Devon wants to have a surgery for his son so that he wouldn't often dislocate, you understand? So it is only one day before. And Devon wants to come here. And he's one of the biggest reason that he wants to be here is in the same room there will be Levan,
Engin Terzi: Today, he told me, he will be like, he said, Engin, you will be there, Levan will be there, Deniz will be there, Gergud Viz will be there, John Brzenk will be there. Like all the legends, he said that he may not be in the same room with these people until he dies. So he thinks that it's an opportunity and he wants to come. But from other side, because his son, his son doesn't have problem him to come, but his wife wants him to be with them.
Tornike (Translator): And he feels responsible. That is why most likely he won't be able to come. But we're talking about Devon. I mean, like, anything is possible, even if it is one percent. Devon is very well known in Istanbul and in the United States. I think this is because of the cooperation between the two countries. As you know, the two countries did not know that Devon would come.
Tornike (Translator): Family comes first and I definitely respect Devon's decision.
Engin Terzi: And I want to wish his kid a quick recovery. Yeah, I agree. I agree. SG Records, you know, Roman, he says, Toko, don't come in Istanbul. I will lose my job. Okay, Roman. He's a great guy, so definitely. Sandris...
Levan Saginashvili: Levan has a question. Yes, yes, go ahead. Dave you tried communicating with Richard Lucas? Because it's been a while we haven't heard of him and I'm a big fan of him. Yes, I did, I did.
Engin Terzi: Um, he said that he's not available. I reached him and he was very, uh, in a nice way, respectful way. He said, I won't be able to come, but I, yes, I reached him and I reached him through Bob Bowen. And he said, he's not available. And if he ever wants to come, you know, all he needs to do is just say, I'm coming, you know, and I would, I would invite him. Um, yeah.
Engin Terzi: There is a Super Shed underneath. You know, it is a disrespect to Michael, my friend, please. I know you, you pay money for the Super Sedis. I don't know how much it means that five C H F, but please no disrespect to other athletes here. Lucio.
Engin Terzi: Thank you for your support. He says, Hi Levan, what do you really think about Ermes? Is he still your favorite next opponent? Will you face him in 2023? They're asking. What do you think about Ermes? He is your favorite opponent and he will be your opponent in 2036.
Levan Saginashvili: Well, I don't know how to say it, it's in a very bad shape, I've seen all the photos, and I'm a little worried that it's in a bad shape, but it's okay. Well, if it works, we'll see what happens, and I don't know what to say.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, Mermez is very impressive. His latest shape seems really good, especially with those huge shoulders. If he manages to be victorious over Chaffee, I would definitely say yes to the match. And I'm definitely all in for it. And the question is, honestly, since he is not organized, he can use prediction. What does he think about that match?
Levan Saginashvili: And what do you think about this, Mr. Koulis? Yes, Mr. Tsefi. I think that Mr. Tsefi is right. But Koulis, for some reason, thinks that he will be able to do it. You know, he will be able to do it. In general, there is no doubt that he will do it.
Tornike (Translator): My head, my mind is saying that Ermes should win, but my heart is still feeling that Chaffee. So it's going to be a quite a tough battle. Especially, I think that the first round, probably the Chaffee will take it. And he's sure that it won't be a zero score or on any side.
Engin Terzi: Okay, why does his heart want... No. It's not the want, it's more of the feeling. Of feeling, feeling, okay. Oh, not that he wants, but it is that he feels that something like that can happen. Yes. And Avukat Yusuf Edike, thank you for your suggestion. For Levan, who are the gods in all weight classes?
Engin Terzi: but I don't think that he can go like 55, 60, 65, 70. Yeah. But you can tell us who is the middleweight gold, probably John or the light, lightweight and the,
Levan Saginashvili: His opinion, it's not my business, just let him. Of course, it's John. John, when he was 50 or 50, he was with Ziplinko.
Tornike (Translator): He even won over Denis Tsiplenkov, who was 40 or 50 kgs more than him with the 6-0 score when everybody thought that Denis was unbeatable.
Engin Terzi: So, yeah, there's nothing else you can add here. Top role is for smart. This guy is asking a question. And, you know, there was a question, but before I asked this question, top role is for smart. You know, this is what he says. He says that Krasimir Kostadinov says that real man cooks and then
Engin Terzi: Ermes says that smart people top roles. And he said that the top role is for smart people. What does Lewand think about this too? And then I will ask the main question. Thank you very much, Nanduli. Thank you very much, Nanduli. Thank you very much, Nanduli. Thank you very much, Nanduli.
Levan Saginashvili: No, it's not. Because the muscles are strong. And the movement can be said to be very hard. Because the muscles are strong, you can feel that you are moving. Because, as I said, the muscles of the biceps are strong, and the biceps can feel that they are strong. And the body is very pro-genetic. It is very pro-genetic.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, he thinks that one fact is that top roll has less risk in terms of injury. And especially when you fight in a long tournament, it's more energy saving and beneficial to fight with a top roll. Everybody can strengthen their bicep, but to be a good top roller, you need genetics also. So he says that...
Tornike (Translator): In those terms, the top role is better. I understand. And then this guy is saying that greetings to Levan. He needs to arm wrestle more often. Do you have anything to add, Elio, or do you want to add something, Levan? I would like to add something. I would like to add something.
Levan Saginashvili: I would like to say a few words about Klausid. I would like to say a few words about Klausid. I would like to say a few words about Klausid. I would like to say a few words about Klausid.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, he would be glad to.
Tornike (Translator): But fans have to understand that it takes time to peak and to come in the best shape. He has done a big promise to never lose a round. So he has to be confident in his preparation and to bring his top performance. And yeah, that's why, of course, it takes some time to wind down after the competition and then to get back to the best shape.
Levan Saginashvili: In MMA, there are a lot of fights from the beginning to the end. I don't think there will be a lot of fights in the future, because we will have a lot of fights in the future. We will have a lot of fights in the future, and then we will have a lot of fights in the future. We will have a lot of fights.
Levan Saginashvili: Justin like in MMA, the athletes take quite a break in between the fights. So he feels that it's the same for him also.
Tornike (Translator): With the longer breaks, he can prepare much better than he could have done the other way. So maybe that's why he can bring such a good shape like he did to his latest matches. I will ask him a few questions. One of them is a quick question. He said that he promised himself he's not going to lose in a round. But just say that, you know, he
Engin Terzi: I don't know what to say, but I think it's a good question.
Levan Saginashvili: Of course, if the referees are fair and he indeed have made a fall, then yeah, that counts.
Tornike (Translator): If he feels that it was some crazy refereeing, he would not think twice about it. Okay, GB19 is asking, if Ermes loses, will Lewand rematch Sheffy? Ermes will win the rematch against Sheffy. What do you think? I think it's possible. Sheffy will win.
Levan Saginashvili: I have a very good relationship with him, and if I have to say, I don't know why. I think he has a very good relationship with me, and now it is possible for me to work with him, and I think that I have a very good relationship with all of them. And now I have a very good relationship with him.
Tornike (Translator): With pleasure. I would gladly pull with Keifi. We are in good terms with him. And overall, I'm very impressed with how consistent, good shape he can bring from tournament to tournament and with such frequency. So huge respect to him. Yeah. Another question I want to ask. This is my question. When he pulled Devon in Dubai,
Engin Terzi: It was kind of a direct strap after 30 seconds, whatever, a direct strap. If Dave Chaffee comes with the same condition, would he accept? In the Devon match, you said that after 30 seconds, he would automatically stop.
Levan Saginashvili: Do you agree with the fact that this was the first time you were arrested? Yes, I agree with that. I was arrested on the 8th of July, but I am very sure that I was arrested on the 2nd of July, and that is because I was not ready, I had no idea what to do.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, he would gladly take it with those conditions.
Tornike (Translator): And he also would like to add that even though the 30-second autostrap is not his favorite, surprisingly, he really enjoyed the gripping up and going on the go without the ready. He feels that many opponents try to false start him and start on the radio. And with this, just the go rule, that eliminates that possibility.
Engin Terzi: He really enjoyed that part. I think the way to eliminate this is not like, ready, go. This is not ready. It's like a warning or even a question. That should be ready.
Engin Terzi: go you know it should be like this but people goes like ready go and then some starts with red some start with d some start with go so that is why he he doesn't like that but in fact there should be a small pause between ready and go and then we can we can the question the reason that i ask about dave chaffee when he beat dave chaffee people so badly wanted to see that match in strap everyone
Engin Terzi: And some people said that the result would be different. At least it would be harder. I mean, I respect everyone's opinion if it was in SREP. So what I'm just saying that if there is such a rule to start in SREP with Dave Chaffee, I'm sure it will bring more attention to the match. That was my reason to ask that question.
Tornike (Translator): I would like to ask you about that, because I think that the fact that Mige and Sashuele were so close to each other, they probably didn't know each other, but it seems that they had a very close relationship. No, no, I agree completely. I agree completely, because when a person wants something,
Levan Saginashvili: If you really want to be able to do it, you have to be able to do it yourself. You have to be able to do it yourself. You have to be able to do it yourself. You have to be able to do it yourself. You have to be able to do it yourself. You have to be able to do it yourself.
Levan Saginashvili: He was the one who decided to do it and he was the one who decided to do it. He was the one who decided to do it. He was the one who decided to do it. He was the one who decided to do it. He was the one who decided to do it. He was the one who decided to do it. He was the one who decided to do it. He was the one who decided to do it. He was the one who decided to do it.
Tornike (Translator): Levan thinks that in a strap he would have won even easier because when going without the strap and when opponent tries to slip, it's harder for him because he has to hold on to the hand and also has to pin it. One good example is as it was with Ongarbaev, he tried to slip in every round.
Tornike (Translator): uh and he had to go after his hand catch it uh grab it and then pull to the pad and uh when whenever it went to the strap it became much easier uh so yeah hard to compare david you know dave has more horsepower but still i understand what he's saying yeah
Levan Saginashvili: I would say that it was my responsibility to make the right decision and when I realized that my decision was wrong and the other person's decision was wrong, it was my responsibility to make the right decision and when I realized that my decision was wrong and the other person's decision was wrong, it was my responsibility to make the right decision and when I realized that my decision was wrong, it was my responsibility to make the right decision and when I realized that my decision was wrong, it was my responsibility to make the right decision and when I realized that my decision was wrong, it was my responsibility to make the right decision and when I realized that my decision was wrong, it was my responsibility to make the right decision and when I realized that my decision was wrong, it was my responsibility to make the right decision and when I realized that my decision was wrong, it was my responsibility to make the right decision and when I realized that my decision was wrong, it was my responsibility to make the right decision and when I realized that my decision was wrong, it was my responsibility to make the right decision and when I realized that
Tornike (Translator): yeah he's not comparing chafee and ongar buff he just wants to say that uh when the opponent tries to sleep and that's his only uh mission uh then he has to catch that hand first and then good get to the uh pulling position uh so he no disrespect to dave but he thinks that that day
Levan Saginashvili: with the straps he would have i agree i agree with him yeah i am not sure if it would be easier but i agree that he would still win he advices to try it with the opponent during training
Tornike (Translator): You can ask the opponent to try to slip and then without the slip and he should feel the difference. He is advising me to try? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, yes. Okay, tell him that there is nothing in arm wrestling that I haven't tried. I believe.
Engin Terzi: How old are you, Levan? 34. 34, yeah. I have been pulling for 31 years. Yeah. Anyway, so Makedonek is asking a serious question. Does Levan himself really think that he can lose a match against anyone right now?
Engin Terzi: or even in the future? Does he think that there is anyone that can beat him, does he believe? Or even in the future, like just say like in five years, for example? How is it, Aris? What do you think? What do you think about your relationship with Sandris in the last five years? Well, I don't know. If it's in the past and if it's in the future, I don't know what to say.
Levan Saginashvili: On the other hand, I would like to say that there are very serious problems in our country, and now, after all these years of oppression, it is clear that this era is not going to end. I would like to say that this issue is related to my work, that I would like to say a few things that I would like to say.
Levan Saginashvili: He's saying that there are a lot of very strong super heavyweights and they are getting better and better.
Tornike (Translator): so many super strong heavyweights, maybe this might be the best there ever was. So this question is more to himself, how much he can work and to prepare and to bring his best shape. If he becomes lazy and doesn't train enough, then of course there is a chance and there are many good candidates and strong athletes.
Tornike (Translator): But if he puts in the work, the effort, grinds and brings his best shape, then nobody. Yeah. I mean, it looks that way. Ryan Adonis, thank you for your super chat. Hi, Levan. Will you ever come to America? And can we meet you if you do come to America?
Levan Saginashvili: The situation in Georgii is as follows. In 1928, the United States signed the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America. As you know, the United States is not the only country in the world to have a visa, and the United States is the only country in our history to have a visa, which means that the United States is not the only country in the world to have a visa.
Tornike (Translator): He will gladly, but it's quite hard for Georgii to get the visa at the moment, especially since the USA embassy is closed until 2024. So no new visas are getting, he can't get the visa until then.
Engin Terzi: He hasn't even tried getting the visa from other countries. You can come to Turkey. Be my guest. I will host you here. We train together. I top roll you. And you can go to embassy. I'm joking, but seriously, if you ever come, you can be our guest as long as you want.
Levan Saginashvili: and in Istanbul we have embassy consulate, in Ankara embassy. Justin, I mean, if you ever need, you know, I mean, we can be with you, help you, whatever you need, my friend. Justin...
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, he would gladly go. He gets many offers, like for example, just the
Tornike (Translator): Like a week ago, Travis Bajent asked him to invite him to an event, but he had to refuse because of this reason. In the future, he definitely considers it. And thank you, Engin. I might use your help in this. Anytime. Anytime, my friend. He's asking about me. He says, what does Engin Terzi mean to Levan?
Levan Saginashvili: What do you think of Engender? I think of Engender as a person who has a strong desire for sports. And a person who, at any moment,
Levan Saginashvili: There was a lot of pressure from the outside, and there was a lot of pressure from the inside, and there was a lot of pressure from the outside, and there was a lot of pressure from the inside, and there was a lot of pressure from the outside, and there was a lot of pressure from the inside, and there was a lot of pressure from the outside, and there was a lot of pressure from the inside, and there was a lot of pressure from the outside, and there was a lot of pressure from the inside, and there was a lot of pressure from the outside, and there was a lot of pressure from the inside, and there was a lot of pressure from the outside, and there was a lot of pressure from the inside, and there was a lot of pressure from the outside, and there was a lot of pressure from the outside, and there was a lot of pressure from the inside, and there was a lot of pressure from the outside, and there was a lot of pressure from the inside, and there was a lot of pressure from the outside, and there was a lot
Levan Saginashvili: It is very important to have a good relationship with your neighbors and to have a good relationship with your neighbors. It is very important to have a good relationship with your neighbors. It is very important to have a good relationship with your neighbors. It is very important to have a good relationship with your neighbors.
Tornike (Translator): Engin is a person who loves the sport, loves the arm wrestling and is very passionate about it and he has done a huge, he has taken a huge responsibility and organizes great events in the times where everything was really complicated and this deserves a huge respect. For example, with the
Tornike (Translator): All we know about the conflict happening, the war in Ukraine, and that's why, for example, Mazarenko can't leave the country and tries to support his homeland. Whenever he's back, it would be even better to join the forces and to make the arm-wrestling sport even better. Thank you, Devon.
Engin Terzi: um there is silence master for levan there is no chance for the dennis to win why i think he's asking dennis cannot beat him levan thinks this way and he's asking why i don't i didn't understand exactly what silence masters think well why i think uh irene says she asked why you think that dennis doesn't have chance against you
Levan Saginashvili: The reason why I think that Denis is lucky with me is because this is a psychological question. I think that even though I don't think that Denis is lucky with me, I don't think that I'm lucky because I don't want to say that I'm lucky with him. In reality, I would like to say that Denis is very lucky because he is a professional in this sport.
Tornike (Translator): This is psychological. I will say that nobody can beat me and nobody has a chance. So that I'm mentally prepared for the victory. Of course, if you look at it from the side, it's easy to say anything. And if I'm not prepared, any great professional, would it be Dennis or
Engin Terzi: any other of course can be victoria victorious but they have to be fully ready and this includes psychologically also so he made his mind up that nobody can be i mean i will tell you something i was 65 you know i was thinking that you know i should beat everyone in the world
Engin Terzi: There was Alan Carter. He was almost 200 kilos. Whenever I look at him, I was thinking, planning how I would beat him, where to attack. You know, if I was thinking that way, which didn't make sense, of course, that Levan should be that confident about himself. Imagine you being Levan and believing that someone can beat you. I mean, it doesn't mean that nobody can beat him or something, but from his perspective, he cannot think anything different. You know, how can he think that somebody can beat me? You know, I mean,
Levan Saginashvili: Sultan Wattai, thank you for your super chat. What Levan thinks about Zaur, how is your life? Zaur is a very good sportsman and he is very good at football. He is a very good sportsman and he is very good at everything.
Levan Saginashvili: I don't think I will be able to compete in the European Championships. I don't think I will be able to compete in the European Championships. I don't think I will be able to compete in the European Championships. I don't think I will be able to compete in the European Championships. I don't think I will be able to compete in the European Championships. I don't think I will be able to compete in the European Championships. I don't think I will be able to compete in the European Championships.
Tornike (Translator): Zaur is a great athlete. He has surprised us all with his latest victories over other great athletes. He remembers that he has met Zaur in, was it either European or World Championship? He doesn't remember if they had a match or was it Gennady who had the match?
Engin Terzi: uh but but anyways if uh if he uh continues this way and uh maybe they can even meet some sometime in the future yeah i understand yeah yeah sorry again i'm at broad attention is asking what age levan considers the peak of the strength he is now 34 years old is that any athletes he considered as the future of arm wrestling like what does it in the peak of an athlete
Tornike (Translator): age and age 34 is there anyone that he thinks that you know will be the future of the sport uh
Levan Saginashvili: When I was 31, I thought I would be 31. When I was 32, I thought I would be 32. When I was 34, I thought I would be 34. Well, that's the way it is. And I want everyone to know that we are all in the same boat. And I think that's the way it is. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much for your attention.
Levan Saginashvili: There is no resolution to this, and I think that in the future the Georgii government will have to make a decision about this. On the other hand, it is also new to me that there is no resolution to the fact that Damien is going to be deposed.
Tornike (Translator): Well, he's saying that, well, when he was 30, he thought the best age was 30. Then he became 32. That became his best age. Now he's 34. And thanks to God, he can keep up the strength and gain more experience. So, yeah, it's still a thing to find out.
Engin Terzi: As for the future, he sees that Revaz Lutidze might surprise many and it might even happen that we might have a great Georgii supermatch in the future. Yeah, I have an opinion about it. I don't want to share so much, but in my opinion, Revaz Lutidze has never reached even close to his potential limits. And
Engin Terzi: In my opinion, if there is anyone who is the most dangerous, maybe not now, but once it reaches to the potential limits, in my opinion, because of his potential, I think the most dangerous person for Levan is Revaz Lutidze, possibly. Can you ask him if he thinks that
Tornike (Translator): He may be the most dangerous, maybe not now, but in the future. I think that the potential of a good speaker is not limited to him. He has a great potential. And if we believe that he will have that potential, he will be a great opponent for Leonid. Yes, he is a great opponent.
Levan Saginashvili: It's not that I don't want to talk to Georgii. It's not that I don't want to talk to Georgii. It's not that I don't want to talk to Georgii. It's not that I don't want to talk to Georgii. It's not that I don't want to talk to Georgii. It's not that I don't want to talk to Georgii. It's not that I don't want to talk to Georgii. It's not that I don't want to talk to Georgii.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, he definitely agrees that Ravas is a very dangerous opponent potentially to him. And overall, he also adds that for him, it's really tough to fight against Georgii athletes psychologically.
Tornike (Translator): He always prefers to fight with foreign opponents. And yeah, he thinks that potentially the biggest armors at the moment are probably Ermes and Rivas in terms of how much they can grow. Yeah, I agree. Sandris is asking, please ask Levan if he is participating at Dancing with the Stars. I don't know what it means. I know, I know.
Engin Terzi: It says, which secret dance move can he bring to the table? Good recovery to Engin and cheers to Levan. OK, what's that? I don't know what it is. What dance move? So Levan got the offer for the Dancing with the Stars in Georgii.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, so he has told about this offer on the live with Neil Pickup and he was offered
Tornike (Translator): to take part in Dance with the Stars TV show in Georgii. But he had to refuse simply because he couldn't find enough time for such a big project because it takes time and it requires effort. Can he dance? He's great at it.
Engin Terzi: His upper body is too big. He does slow but very artistic movement. Wow. We would like to see that. We would like to see that. And can you ask him, Levan,
Levan Saginashvili: Will you a little bit pull after pull in Istanbul or not? Will you a little bit pull after pull in Istanbul or not?
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah.
Tornike (Translator): He will try to avoid it. It's very risky in terms of injury. He hasn't started the heavy preparation yet. He plans to start it after the event. So since he had the injury on the left hand, he tries to be very careful and he will try to avoid the injury. Okay, okay. I respect it. And Canardin, thank you for your super chat. Who does Levan believe is a better challenge to him? Jerry or Ermes?
Levan Saginashvili: What do you think about it? I think it's very interesting, and I think it's very different from Jerry's. If you look at Jerry and I, you can see that we both have a car and a car, and Jerry and I are very close to each other. I mean, he's very close to me, and the media is very close to him.
Tornike (Translator): Levan is saying that he would like to have a match with Jerry and he wants to remind that Jerry has said that he would bet a car key on the match. Two years ago, yeah. Levan is ready to keep the bet? I need Jerry's correct.
Levan Saginashvili: I remember I remember on the news program. Yes, yes. Yeah, I remember. Yeah. And next time you have live with Jerry, could you please remind him and ask if he if he's still in because he has
Engin Terzi: uh to keep his man's word and uh the promise oh okay if if gary and levan is ever set to pull levan will also remind that one that one but will will levan also what what is that one is gonna put the table i don't know yeah okay okay
Engin Terzi: I don't know what it means. Okay. Again, Levan, 200 T-shirts. Oh, my God. Guys, if you donate $100, you are going to get a T-shirt from the East vs. West 5 with all the participating athletes, Ermes, Dave Chaffee,
Engin Terzi: John Burzing, Petrenko, Morozov, and then Levan Saginashvili and Denis Shibrenko. Justin support Devon, please. Okay, Nenemu Sigiri, another one. He is asking, how did he feel, Devon, compared to his previous opponents? And I imagine a question to it, what was his shape?
Tornike (Translator): compared to his top eight shape. How did you compare your opponents to Devon? And how did you use your form and what kind of form did you use? I would like to say that I compared him to Devon. For example, he is very strong. As far as I'm concerned, he is very strong.
Levan Saginashvili: In Dobryshch, we had 200 kilos, 230 kilos, and 233 kilos. And now we have more than that.
Levan Saginashvili: It's not only in the body, it's also in the biceps, in everything. And now there is a percentage of people who say that they are in a very, very bad shape, that they can't do the top class. First of all, I would like to say... How did Lara do it? Do you know? That's what I would like to say, if I were in that shape,
Tornike (Translator): So, Levan started with the answer to the second question first. Of course, he can measure this if he compares his strength level with the gym lifts he has done.
Tornike (Translator): And he usually uses the bench press as the benchmark. For example, in previous preparations, he has gone up to lifting 220, 230 kg bench. But for Devon, this was, he lifted 260. And he's about 15% stronger at this in the bench press. Yes. And then the same percentage carried on with the wrist curls, with the biceps. So
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, if we look at the raw strength comparison with number against number, that's what he saw. And he says that it was much better shape than what he had in top eight. Okay, so whenever he pulled against Devon, he was in much better shape. We can say about minimum 10% better shape than when he pulled against Lalecin. Yep. And as for Devon, considering that his shape was this good,
Tornike (Translator): He has felt Devon's strength, especially in the first round, and he thinks that on that day, nobody would be able to defeat Devon, except of him. Okay, so he's thinking that Devon in that shape was really number two in his opinion, in Devon's opinion, and Devon was on that day number two in the world. This is his opinion. I don't think so.
Levan Saginashvili: I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, he really do believes that this was Devon's best shape so far.
Tornike (Translator): that he prepared during those six months or whatever it was, he felt his static strength, especially. And considering on what level he was, yeah, he's sure that on that day, Devon was number two. I understand, yeah. I understand. Sorry, because people ask question. I'm sorry, you know.
Engin Terzi: I really need to ask because they, they, I want to ask my own questions, but I also need to ask because people, I don't want to. Okay. Queens, thank you for your super chat. Does Devon think that Devon could be much stronger if he trained more like Devon's weight? For example, Devon doesn't train his biceps enough. If Devon was in the gym, does Devon think that Devon would be a little bit stronger than how he is now? Mm-hmm.
Tornike (Translator): The question is, how do you think Devon, who has been working on your site for a long time and has been working on your vices for a long time, is going to do?
Levan Saginashvili: Well, it's individual. It's not like I'm the only one in the sport. I'm the only one, but I'm also the only one who knows how to do it. I'm the only one who knows how to do it. I'm the only one who knows how to do it. I'm the only one who knows how to do it. I'm the only one who knows how to do it. I'm the only one who knows how to do it.
Tornike (Translator): uh yeah the training style is very personal and uh very dependent on the previous experience so he can't advise and or definitely tell that devin would benefit from strength training especially with all his experience and the way he knows his body yeah
Engin Terzi: Yeah, probably this is the best way in history. I mean, I also agree that, you know, there is not only one way to reach the top. There are different methods. So Devon is using his method. John is using his method. Levan is using his method. Everyone is using their method. And there is more than one right thing to do. 1.4 GHS, Mac, thank you for your super chat. Has Levan ever arm wrestled with Yakub Kajaya?
Levan Saginashvili: or Geno Petriashvili. They are both silver medalists in super heavyweight Olympic wrestling. Has he ever arm wrestled them? Robert Kajayi. Kajayi is in the United States. He has been in the United States for many years. Kajayi has been in mass wrestling for many years. Kajayi is in the United States.
Levan Saginashvili: I don't know, I don't know if you've heard of it, but I think it's been a long time since I've played in a club, but I've been in wrestling since I was a pre-champion. Gheno Petri is your name, right? Yes. Well, Gheno, I don't know if you know him, but I don't know if you know him, but I don't know if you know him.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, he says if they mean Kajaya, who was the champion in mass wrestling at the moment, he lives in U.S., so he hasn't arm wrestled him. As for Ginovich, really, he's a great wrestler and he would not risk wrestling with him. Arm wrestling, he hasn't tried, but gladly would. Yeah, I mean, everyone has their own way, you know, to be, you know. And Ahmed Brod Atench is asking me a question.
Engin Terzi: Thank you. Thank you, my friends. Considering his age and enormous experience, what age he considered the peak of strength? I mean, if you are healthy, if you are healthy between 25 to 40, I mean, if you are very healthy, probably 30, 35 is the peak age for arm wrestling. But if you are healthy. Makedonek, does Levan want to take the left arm hammer from Dennis?
Levan Saginashvili: to hold both hammers.
Levan Saginashvili: I don't think it's a big deal, but I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea, because if you want to do it, you have to do it. And then, I think it's a good idea, and that's why I think it's a good idea to do it, because I think it's a good idea to do it.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, unfortunately, the left is still not on the same level as the right. He might even say it's roughly at 50%. He, of course, trains it. And if fans don't know, he had a tendon rupture injury and he can train with it. But in terms of arm wrestling, it's far from the optimal shape. He cannot push his limits, is what I understand.
Engin Terzi: Yes. But not push the limits, you know, so much. Yes. How would he win a match against himself if he would arm wrestle Levan Seginashvili? Which strategy would you try? What strategy would you try? What strategy would you try?
Levan Saginashvili: the best way to win levan is probably to get him a g-wagon car at the g-class behind the scenes and ask and ask politely
Engin Terzi: Can you ask Levan if there is a Levan-Denis match in the future? Does he think that Denis could become strong again? Or does he believe that Denis is far from all potential? I think Denis is in good shape.
Levan Saginashvili: And it is clear that all of them do not agree, and they are afraid, and all of them are against it. But what I think is that this is a very important issue. And we are very happy to be here today, because we have this opportunity. And I think that this is a very important issue for our society.
Tornike (Translator): I think that Denis is already in quite a good shape. I think that they are being careful and not telling the whole picture. I think he has been training for Levan for a while now.
Tornike (Translator): no disrespect to john but he thinks that he would not be able to beat dennis at the moment uh he would gladly uh pull with him uh maybe next year if he's up for it uh i would i would gladly take the match okay you know derek simit i'm not in direct he says he challenges levan to a foot race i don't know what it is but foot race like food right
Engin Terzi: I don't know. Hello, Derek. I know him. I was just asking, are we going to see Levan in the East versus West next year, anytime? East versus West, very much possible. As long as we make it
Engin Terzi: agreement, deal, anything is possible. Right? It's professional. Yep. Yeah, of course, with pleasure. Yeah, yeah. And then why did you stop posting YouTube videos?
Levan Saginashvili: He says that your fans, Ahmet Burak Atenci is asking. Good question. Yes, yes, good question. I'd like to thank you for this video. I'd like to thank you for this video. I'd like to thank you for this video. I'd like to thank you for this video. I'd like to thank you for this video. I'd like to thank you for this video. I'd like to thank you for this video.
Levan Saginashvili: And I would like to thank all the sponsors for giving me the opportunity to speak with you today. I would like to thank all the sponsors for giving me the opportunity to speak with you today. I would like to thank all the sponsors for giving me the opportunity to speak with you today.
Levan Saginashvili: He would gladly continue with the YouTube videos. There were some troubles.
Tornike (Translator): The first videographer who was helping him, he is now quite busy with the work. The second videographer, he had gone to the US. So at the moment, he's getting the permission from his sponsors to get the video equipment. And he is in process of getting that set up and to continue with shooting the videos. And he wants to keep the quality high.
Engin Terzi: He doesn't want to just record some videos on the phone. He wants a professional job. Yes, and he's, of course, very thankful to the sponsors for making it possible. So he's working on it. Yeah, Sandris is asking, now Levan, his fiancée, just assumed that he's going to get married and he's going to have a baby. And does he want him to be an armwrestler or he would want him to choose another path in this life?
Levan Saginashvili: Do you have any memories of your time in Klavki? I had a lot of memories. I had a lot of memories of my mother, and I had a lot of memories of my childhood.
Tornike (Translator): Actually, he would prefer if he has a son for him to be a footballer because his father was a footballer. His childhood, he always dreamt to be one. So he feels that would be a better thing. If it's a daughter, then a tennis player.
Engin Terzi: Tennis player. Oh, okay. Okay. That is good. Yeah. And he's asking, I just saw Devon Larratt at the local car dealer at the G-Wagon section. He's ready. The way to beat him, right? The way to beat him.
Engin Terzi: Yes. Okay. Yeah, 14.4 GHZ max. Engin, this Super Chat is for you to ask your own question. Thank you. Yeah, I was looking for opportunity. I don't want to upset anyone. So let me ask my own question. Okay, because we're going to quickly go through the East versus West. Who is winning, Morozov or Ermes, left arm? No.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, he can't remember exactly how good of a left hand Ermes has. So he can't, he's not sure about this one.
Levan Saginashvili: So, but he knows about Morozov, but he cannot compare them. I don't think he can compare them. Because Morozov is a very good fighter. He is a very good sportsman, I can tell you that. But I don't know, I don't think he is a very good fighter. I don't know what to say.
Levan Saginashvili: He thinks that Morozov is a great athlete and a very promising one.
Tornike (Translator): He just thinks that his attitude is a bit light during the matches. And because of that, he sometimes does some mistakes, which might cost him a lot. He thinks that if he approaches the match more seriously, he will have better chances. I understand. Ahmet brought attention. Support Engin Terzi. Thank you for your support. And he is the greatest entrepreneur.
Engin Terzi: I'm missing all time whatsoever. Buy the paper win t-shirts. For God's sake, there will be his and Levan's signature on them. Thank you, my friend. Protectsaves, thank you for your super chat. Levan, are you planning on competing in the US anytime in the future or next year? And have you been called Shrek of arms sports yet? Thanks, guys. Probably he didn't hear the previous super chat, but thanks.
Engin Terzi: Again. Yeah, he's just saying that I have already answered that question. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And to get a signed t-shirt. Is it $100 donation or more? It's only $100 donation. Thank you for your subject. Clerks would never drop wait for more challenge.
Engin Terzi: i don't think so the lowest rate one lower class is 115 kilo i don't think he would go there but you can ask him uh
Levan Saginashvili: And it's hard. It's hard for me, and it's hard for us too. In general, I would like to say that it's not a big deal, because it's not a big deal. And it's not a big deal. It's not a big deal for us. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal for us.
Levan Saginashvili: during the period of the war, and now it is becoming more and more common. It is difficult to maintain such a mass, it is difficult. Of course, this is one of the reasons why I want to continue working in this field. Of course, I will continue to work because the organization is now in a very difficult situation and I want to continue.
Tornike (Translator): uh yeah dropping down the weight class would be hard because he really enjoys to eat and loves the food um of course it's not sustainable to always be this heavy uh at him at the moment he weighs 180 kgs and he hasn't even started the heavy preparation 180 yes uh and uh yeah he he agrees that this is not uh
Tornike (Translator): good weight to be at and probably when he his age is over 40 probably he will drop to 140 or 135 because of course it's not easy to keep this weight and if he starts the heavy preparation his weight might even go plus 10 kg so it's it's not easy
Engin Terzi: I think he needs to lose the unnecessary weight, and then when he gets prepared, he is going to gain weight, but muscle. But also at the same time, I think that it would be better if he loses the weight already, in my opinion. Later, it is when you get prepared, preparation, weight loss is getting harder because you need to eat also. I think off-season, Levan is better to lose the weight already.
Levan Saginashvili: If I were to go to Istanbul, I would go by car. I would go by car. I would go by car. I would go by car. I would go by car. I would go by car. I would go by car. I would go by car. I would go by car.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, when he was in Istanbul, if you remember, he weighed 158 kg at the moment. And he was feeling much better then. And that was the off-season too. So he's not sure what happened now. Probably he ate too much. And yeah, he's quite heavier now.
Engin Terzi: uh he he made the the blood work the analysis and everything is fine so uh fans can be uh calm in that regard probably he just made too much I understand but um Levan you are right now young 34. now your blood values are normal but if you come to mid 40s 45 50 with this weight
Engin Terzi: uh first it will be harder for you to lose your metabolism will go slower and the two and then at that time blood uh level may not be the same 10 years later so as a brother my suggestion yeah your your metabolism is still not bad working
Engin Terzi: try to lose I also need to lose weight I'm I was I mean pulling maximum 75 kilo category now I'm 93 kilo is no good you know your blood pressure will go up everything rather just just I know I know when you do preparation preparation you are very careful everything when the preparation finish you just eat everything you know yeah
Engin Terzi: especially if you are super overweight and it's even harder because you don't need to make weight category you know i mean there is nothing that you have to if you have 110 kilo or 100 kilo you go down and go up thank you to go and you need to go again down but level now he doesn't have to go down the only reason they need to go down is his health yeah
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, he's saying that he fully agrees and he has a question. Are you planning for Farid Usman to participate
Tornike (Translator): in the tournament? January, January and most likely against Gennady Kuvikvinia. You know how to organize a match.
Engin Terzi: yeah and rosie is asking levan's opinion about prudnik and devon under 115 kilo we finish it quickly i will ask those matches if devon pulls prudnik who's gonna win 115 kilo category guys please don't ask more more super chats please don't ask because i want to finish it i don't want to keep levan sorry levan
Levan Saginashvili: Huge respect to Prudnik, but I think that Devon will win the match. He thinks that
Tornike (Translator): The wrist weakness of Prudnik, if he hasn't worked on it, might be crucial. And with the King's move, Devon might be able to win. I understand. And Levan, John Bersink, Petrenko? Oh, very hard. I don't know. Yeah. Close match. And Sandris Smetmask?
Levan Saginashvili: Sandris. Sandris is going to win. I think my .
Levan Saginashvili: He thinks that he's a relative, Saginashvili, a young boy of 19, who is also an arm wrestler. Evgeny he can beat Matt Mask. Bacho Saginashvili, I think, is a close friend of Mavali. And it will be very interesting to see him. I would like to thank you very much, Bacho.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, he thinks that Batros Aginashvili, he's very young and he's already very strong. Evgeny meeting with the schoolboy would be interesting. And he thinks that in the future, he might be very strong. You know, every time I do a live here,
Engin Terzi: different, different, different, different, different Georgii all the time ask, you know, Saginashvili schoolboy, Saginashvili schoolboy, probably they ask Lewand to ask this question before the game. Can you ask him if they ask him to ask this question? Mask him to? Does the Georgii, the Georgii ask him to, you know, to ask this question?
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, he says that.
Tornike (Translator): Yep, this is just his opinion. Yeah, he really thinks that Batros Agnesh really can definitely win. Would it be either Schoolboy or Khalid or many, many other? Yeah, he just thinks that at this age, with this strength, he's a phenom. He's good, huh?
Engin Terzi: Yep. Yeah, very good. Yeah, that's that's that. Do you know? Did you see the match between Matt Mask and Krasimir? Yeah, well, what you're going to do? Many have beaten Krasimir lately. Yeah, but but now did he know that he just won the waffles on the kilo?
Levan Saginashvili: Mr. Krasim, what do you think about this? I don't think it's our fault. We didn't do anything wrong in the beginning, and we didn't do anything wrong in the beginning. It's not like there's a new government, but I think it's our fault.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, he thinks that WAC is not as a representation as it used to be, since many countries and athletes are not taking part anymore. He's sure that there are many great athletes there, but it's not what it used to be. Oh, okay, I understand, I understand. Yeah, this is what he's thinking. And Levan, were you there when Ongarbe and Devon trained in Malaysia?
Tornike (Translator): No, he has not seen it. Okay, they said that they trained it before, two days before Ongarwe pulled Kurdesha and Devon and Ongarwe pulled there.
Tornike (Translator): this is what i want and do you know that do you know the iraq is going to pull on garbaev in january of course he knows and we are preparing and do you does he think that it's a good match close match
Levan Saginashvili: It is very important for Iraqis to know what they are doing, what they are doing, what they are doing, and what they are doing, and what they are doing, and what they are doing, and what they are doing, and what they are doing, and what they are doing, and what they are doing, and what they are doing,
Levan Saginashvili: Ongarbaev is a very tough and great opponent for lrakli.
Tornike (Translator): he fully understands that it will be a tough match. And also, Ungarbaev is a much harder opponent for lrakli than his previous match in Dubai. So, they are working on his weaknesses and preparing for the match very seriously. And this way, he thinks lrakli has a great chance. And does he think that if Katachins and lrakli pulls again, lrakli can beat
Levan Saginashvili: Tatachinks right now, would there be any difference? What do you think will happen to Tatachinks and lrakli? What do you think will happen to lrakli? What do you think will happen to Tatachinks and lrakli?
Levan Saginashvili: I would like to say to all of you that I am very grateful to you for the opportunity to participate in this event. It was a very big event. It was a very big event, and I am very happy that it was a big event and that I was able to participate in it. I am very happy that I was able to participate in this event. I am very happy that I was able to participate in this event. I am very happy that I was able to participate in this event.
Tornike (Translator): We are working very hard for this rematch to happen and preparing for it. This loss has been a great lesson for lrakli and he has made a good lesson from it and maybe next year we can make this rematch happen and we will definitely
Engin Terzi: work very hard for it. And the last one, Revaz versus Morozov? Revaz, 100%. Yeah, but do you think that if they go top row, top row, yeah, but do you think there is a possibility Morozov to hook Revaz as he did to Dave Chaffee? No, pick from Morozov versus Lipshaw, hook Shevites.
Levan Saginashvili: uh yeah he thinks that morozov will not be able to force the hook as revas will uh
Tornike (Translator): be able to take his wrist on the start. And he thinks Revaz should be able to win just like he did with Derek Smith and should be able to top roll him. Is Revaz in his best ever shape in his life? Yes. And he only knows this by talking or did you also see him lately?
Levan Saginashvili: Well, I don't know how to put it in one word. I don't know how to put it in one word. I don't know how to put it in one word. I don't know how to put it in one word. I don't know how to put it in one word. I don't know how to put it in one word.
Tornike (Translator): So they have not pulled, but they have trained together. And Levan is seeing that Rebazi in much better shape at the moment in terms of strength and in terms of attitude. He's much more tuned for the victory. And if compared with the shape he was with Michael Todd,
Engin Terzi: Levan thinks that he's much, looks much better now. Okay, I say last, but Zurab Tawberis and Ryan Bowen? Yeah, Zurab. Mask him why he's laughing.
Levan Saginashvili: and I don't want to say that he is the same person as he used to be, and that he is very different from what he used to be, but I think that he is the same sportsman as he used to be, and the situation is not as objective as it is now.
Tornike (Translator): He says that Ryan is a great guy and he likes him very much. But in terms of arm wrestling, he thinks that he's no match to his Rob. Oh, it is not the same level. Okay. Anyways, yeah, I understand. Levan, thank you very much, my friend. It is always an honor to have you here. Mask Jerry. Thank you to ask Jerry.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but I will ask what? Will you give me commission? We will arrange something. What's that? He says we will arrange something. We will talk about it. Okay, later. Thank you very much.
Levan Saginashvili: Toniki, thank you very much. You are wonderful. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. In short, in Georgii, and in my own words, and in my own words, it is clear that there is nothing wrong with me, and I am happy to say that I am happy to be here.
Levan Saginashvili: Levan has a question. He has heard from the Georgii fans and some other fans that maybe
Engin Terzi: Jerry is faking the injury to meet with Levan in February. He doesn't think that, he thinks that Jerry is indeed injured, but he wants to know your opinion. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's in incredible shape. I saw some videos. He's in, I mean, he looks incredibly strong and he really wanted to pull. He really wanted to pull Ermes and he really wanted to pull Levan, yeah.
Tornike (Translator): So, Levan is thinking that just because he doesn't want to give the Corvette, that's why he's faking it. There's a lot of suggestions, and I can't agree with you. Do you think the Corvette will win? No, I don't think so. People think so.
Levan Saginashvili: In reality, it is possible to do so, but I would like to make a special announcement. First of all, I would like to say that I am very happy to be able to speak to you today. I would like to ask you if you would like to speak to me. I would like to know if it is possible or not.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, he's saying that it's not his thought, but thought of others that maybe Jerry just tries to skip Ermes and go straight for Levan. Would that be possible? Oh, but how can he go straight for Levan when the winner, Dave and Jerry, people are thinking that, you know, they will pull Levan.
Engin Terzi: Because everyone was talking about this is the qualification match. What would Ermes say about it? And Jerry is changing his flight ticket to come January to East versus West.
Engin Terzi: So in February, Levan is going to be pulling in Dubai. So I don't think that Jerry has such a plan. Also, can you, can you tell Levan, tell our Mustang fans to buy, sign t-shirts. You say that you're going to sign, please. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Jerry, move. Uh, uh, uh, Jerry, move. Uh, uh, uh, Jerry, move. Uh, uh, uh, Jerry, move. Uh, uh, Jerry, move. Uh, uh, Jerry, move.

Tornike (Translator): Guys, buy my signed t-shirts. I come in Istanbul and I
