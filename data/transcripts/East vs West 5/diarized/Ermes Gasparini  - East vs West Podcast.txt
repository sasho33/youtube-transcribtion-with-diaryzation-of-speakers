Unknown: Okay.
Engin Terzi: Hello, guys. Hello, Pon. Hello, Andrew. Hello, Irfan. The man in black. Hello. Hello, my friends. Michael workspace. Hello.
Engin Terzi: Hello, my friends, YouTube censoring comments first. Louis, what's up? Esteban, my friend, this is Engin Terzi coming to you live from China. Hello to China. Hello, Aris. Chicken chest. Hello, my friend, Victor. Brandon Richards, Ermes looks like Engin.
Engin Terzi: is much better looking. Why is Devon not our message? Is this what Richard asked? He will, he will. Later. Anyway, so Esteban Leva, here is $2 to buy a pink phone case. I mean, you offer me $10,000 and let's see if I'm putting that pink thing.
Engin Terzi: Wonderful job. Greetings from Rome. Hello to Rome. Hello, Adnan. Dennis Splenko. Why does Ermes think he has a chance against Jeris? Jeris is too powerful.
Engin Terzi: Please make Dimitri Slava versus Levan. Let's see, my friend. Let's see. We will see all of them when the time comes. And here is my old school t-shirts, my sponsor. You can go to this description section and order your supplements with engine codes for 10% discount. Okay, guys.
Engin Terzi: I don't have sound. Good day to you. Greetings from Belgium. Hello to Belgium. Morozov wants to pull Devon. Everyone wants to pull Devon. Everyone.
Unknown: they will probably have to wait. Hello, here's a phone came. Um,
Unknown: hello hello hello stefan hello um do you guys still hear me because when somebody calls and then i put on busy then sometimes the sound goes away with sound is so clear yeah that's good that's good yeah hello stefan thank you for for that
Engin Terzi: Love to Bosnia. That's good that you guys can hear me. I'm still waiting for Ermes to come. We still have three minutes for him to join. It is not about Vitaly is allowed to participate, king of the table, but East versus West event is organized in Turkey. In Turkey,
Engin Terzi: To organize an event, you need to get a permission from the National Federation. That's official law. And Turkish Federation is member of WAF. The ban is coming from WAF. So I need to obey that. Also, if I want to invite the WAF athletes, I need to do that. King of the table is different story. They have nothing to do with the WAF or anything. That's their own decision.
Unknown: Greetings to Italy. Hello to Pakistan. Hello to United Kingdom. Sorry if I'm missing some of you. Levan in East versus West. Possible, possible, but I need to make an agreement with him. And it is not that easy.
Unknown: He's a good person, but of course, these elite athletes have special expectations as they deserve. All of them are special. All of them. I'm just... But some of them, you know just how it works. Hi to Canary Islands. Greetings to Sweden. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.
Engin Terzi: Yep, Prudnik is very, very good guy. Tuesday, I and Prudnik agreed to meet on internet, YouTube. Much respect to Canada, my friends. Yeah, Gosiewski is a legend. Yeah, my favorite flower in the past was different.
Unknown: As I said, I was more elitist about that. The most expensive ones, I thought there was good. Now I like more simple things. They don't have to be expensive. My prediction, Ermes versus Jerry. I better not. It's a tough match. Hello to Korea. Hello to Korea.
Engin Terzi: Are you from South Korea? Rasmus and Matt Mask have lost many fights, one after another. Now, one of the two will have to win. They have done great things. So you know about Brittany. Okay, who is this Leonidas guy? Yesterday when I talked with Devon, he suggested me Leonidas. How good is he?
Engin Terzi: Hello to Belgium. Hello to Belgium. Who is Gennady pulling next? We will decide. Gennady most likely will pull in January. I talked with him. How good is Leonidas? I heard he's from Germany. I heard he's a very strong guy, but when Ermes is coming, I don't know. I told him to come at 7 o'clock. It is 7.01, so anytime I'm expecting him to
Engin Terzi: What brought you to live in USA? John is asking armwrestling. Armwrestling, there was many tournaments. I just wanted to go there. Leonidas is a little under school boy level bodybuilder. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I think I will put the rankings there. I don't know when it's going to be ready. My friend is working on. Hello, Rick. Okay, he is more advanced in arm wrestling than Larry. This is what your team is saying. When will Prudnik and Devon pull? Hopefully next year sometime, but let's see how it will be. Will I pull Devon? I want to pull Devon.
Engin Terzi: but I think I need to have stem cell, my elbows don't handle. Seriously, my muscles are good, strong, but elbow doesn't handle. Do average Turkish people know arm wrestling? Probably yes, probably yes. I think my friend came, Ermes came,
Engin Terzi: Whenever I'm chatting with Ermes, I won't be able to read everything I'm trying to read now. Hello to Czech Republic. Respect. No, no, I know, I know. Ermes, we talk. It's seven o'clock here, six o'clock Italian time. This is, yeah. So he came as you will see soon.
Engin Terzi: Hey, what's up? Italian gladiator. How are you? Good, good, and you? It's a long time we don't... Yeah, we didn't see each other a long time. About one and a half hours. Greetings to Denmark. Okay, so... How are the trainings?
Ermes Gasparini: How is your shape now? My shape now is around 127-128 kilos. And I started training harder than last month. But how is your shape? What percentage are you? Are you maybe 90% of your best?
Ermes Gasparini: 80 now, 85. 85, okay, okay. But 85% of when? Arif match? I think my best shape was when I fought with Bortolato. Bortolato, but your right arm was the best shape? In this moment, I felt my right very, very strong.
Engin Terzi: I remember. Oh, okay. But I compete only left. So you are saying that now your shape is 85% of the time when you pull Bortolato left arm. But your right arm was, if it is 100, it's your best shape. Now you are 85% of that shape. Yeah. Okay, good. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Yeah. And what are you?
Engin Terzi: planning to be more than 100% when you pull Jerry? For Jerry is enough already now. Evgeny now is enough? Yeah, yeah. If I compete tomorrow, I will beat him easy. Oh, even 85% is enough. Okay. Let's see what Jerry will say this. Okay. How about...
Ermes Gasparini: or Levan? You need to be, what, 110, 115%? Maybe more. More? Oh. Yeah, it's very... My prediction with Gennady was, I think, I thought about the last match. Gennady won
Ermes Gasparini: No easily, but I was very surprised about that. The Jerry versus Gennady? Yeah. So you realize that he is a real deal? Jerry is a real deal? You realize that? I don't think because...
Ermes Gasparini: His style is very... Because I think now if he goes with a very good hooker, like Dave Chaffee, I think he loses. But for the top role, he's very dangerous. Yeah, but do you realize that
Engin Terzi: Gennady beat Dave in hook. Yeah. Yeah, whenever Gennady tried top row, Dave beat him easy. But in hook, he catch him and then eventually beat him. But do you realize that one round, Gennady tried to hook Jerry and then Jerry just pressing, you know. I saw in the video the endurance of Gennady was not very good.
Engin Terzi: Is it? Listen, listen, listen. You know, Ermes, sometimes if you meet someone with better endurance, your endurance doesn't look that good. You understand? Like you pull with someone, your endurance is enough. But when you pull someone with better endurance, now your endurance looks bad. But maybe the other guy has better endurance. Maybe. Yeah, yeah. You understand? Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: Because in the first round, Gennady, he won very, not very easy, but in the second round, he couldn't go this way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because the endurance of Brachias is... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: It is not possible to fight only with, you know, Braki Radialis while the guy is putting all his body on it, you know? It is not that easy. Yeah. But did you, like, for example, like, did you, do you know the way, of course, to beat someone, this is not a chess game. This is a chess game, but played with horsepower. So do you know
Ermes Gasparini: already the way to beat Jerry on your mind like do you have a plan do you know yeah now now I every day because when I have a match I'm very I'm very good to see the match I learn many things when I show the match on YouTube yeah
Ermes Gasparini: Same when I fought with Michael Todd. I remember. I saw many times the match with Larratt and Trubin for beating Michael Todd. Now I started with Gennady. I saw many matches he won with John Brzee. Many times with Travis Bajent.
Ermes Gasparini: And... Yeah. I know if you take only his wrist, it's not enough to beat him. He gives his wrist to you. Yeah, he gives it to you. You need to attack here. Here, this part. Yeah, I understand.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, one guy here says that they was exhausted. That's why he lost to Gennady. But my friends, if Gennady would try to top roll him, they would still beat Gennady. The only difference is that he tried to go inside. Whenever he tried third round outside, the foul happened, he was still winning. If Gennady would try to go outside three more rounds, I believe that they would still have won, you know.
Engin Terzi: I mean, so that is not only endurance, but also, you know, the style that Gennady changed. See, there is one guy says that you don't have a chance against Jerry. He says, sorry, Ermes, he says. But I will tell you something. I never lose. No, I want to answer. Say one thing.
Engin Terzi: I never lose when I fight with the, whenever the control. So you never lose with someone with that wrist pressure? No. Yeah. Yeah. But just ask Gennady. He will say that before Jerry, he never lost anyone when he take the wrist. Because I don't remember anyone pressing Gennady like this after Gennady takes this. So just, just remember.
Engin Terzi: I understand you, your outside is better than Gennady, but Jerry is not any of the guys that you have met till today. I'm not saying that he can beat you, but we need to agree that this technique is the best in the history. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So it's different, different. So whenever you say that you never lost, but I don't think that you met anyone like Jerry.
Ermes Gasparini: You can beat him, but I don't... Yeah, so that is... But it is... From one side, it helps you. Like, if you would pull Jerry directly, maybe you would underestimate him so much. Yeah. If I fought with him, maybe... Maybe when I fought with Arif or like this, maybe...
Engin Terzi: I don't know. Now you're better prepared. Yeah, now I understand more. Yeah, but just remember, you just said only five minutes ago, even now you can beat him. And the East versus West finish only what? How many days ago? Eight days ago. In eight days, you didn't train and become Superman. But if you said that you can beat him even now, so it means that
Engin Terzi: like you could beat him even if you would pull him eight days ago, you are saying, because you said you are 85%. So are you saying you can beat him now with 85%? Is it because you are trying to provocate Jerry or is it the truth? I think I beat him now, yeah. Evgeny tomorrow? Tomorrow, if I have the mask or the recovery, 100%. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Without pain like this. But you are going to get, of course, in better shape, right? You're going to get stronger, not 85%. You don't want to lose. I want to lose 100%. Only for guarantee, you understand? Yeah. Also, you want to pull Levan after Jerry if you win. Yeah. Yeah. This is very important for me, this match.
Ermes Gasparini: This match is a good test for me. Yes. Because if maybe I lose with Darius... It means that you are not ready for Levan. If you lose, it means you are not ready for Levan.
Ermes Gasparini: Different style, but still. This situation is very difficult to say about this because it's a very different style. Too much different style. Yes. Maybe I lose as an example. Maybe I lose with Jerry and after that maybe I win with Levan. It's very difficult to imagine this, but
Ermes Gasparini: You know, maybe the athletes have many styles and the style is different when you fight. I understand. Yeah, let's see how it will be. And how do you see your match with Morozov with left arm? What is the chance that
Engin Terzi: I know that you don't trust your left as much as your right. But we saw your left in Dubai. That was also very good. So, like, how do you see? How do you see your chance, like, beating Morozov? It's very difficult. You think you don't have a chance? Because my mind is... I have a focus on...
Ermes Gasparini: 90% with my right arm, you understand. It's important for my career. But I want to pull with left because when I fought with Bortolato I had very good technique and good technique and good power. Now I have a little pain
Ermes Gasparini: I don't know, but if I take his wrist, I think I have... Yeah, if you take the wrist, yeah. And do you think that his chance is higher against you with top roll or he needs to hook you to beat you? I don't think he will hook me. Yeah, it's better for you because he's coming and you are... Yeah, if he goes in the hook with me, no chance.
Engin Terzi: Oh, okay. So you are saying that it will be a top-row battle? Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. And how do you feel? Because he married you in the first round. Yeah, it was just flat risk, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. If Morozov continued attacking him, he could even lose his wrist. But he just stopped and recovered his wrist. And then, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, so, yeah. Do you think that there is a possibility that you may want to pull Morozov some other time, maybe, or you will decide? Not for the last match now, November. Yeah. No, no, I want to pull with him. You want to pull, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. There is Rick Harrow. Thank you for your super chat.
Engin Terzi: Hi, can you ask how much pasta Ermes is eating? Too much. Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. You sent me the pasta picture, you said 350 grams, and you sent the same pasta picture to Devon Idris, and he says 400 grams. But maybe you changed it, right? No, because...
Ermes Gasparini: Because they don't calculate good. OK, OK. It's 350 pasta and another 300 of meat inside. Oh, OK, OK. So 700 portions. Whoa. So you are not sure if it's 300 meat, 400 pasta, or it's 350, 350? So you are not sure.
Ermes Gasparini: Usually I eat 350 or 400. Wow. Only one time because I eat seven times in one day. Wow. Not like this every time. Yeah, some smaller portions. The big portion is...
Ermes Gasparini: Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's see how it will be. Now it's very difficult to do it like this because it's much hot now here. And in the winter, you eat more easily. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now you want more liquid, right?
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah. This temperature is very difficult. I understand. But you said now you are 127 kilos. See, 27, 28, like this. Yeah. When I fought with Bortolato, I remember in the morning, I was 128, 28 and a half, no more.
Ermes Gasparini: Normally, in the day, you eat, you drink, and I remember in the evening, I was 131 kilos. But too much, I remember, too much water because I remember I ate too much carbs. If you eat too much carbs, you...
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes. Very quality. Yeah, it's holding so much water. Yeah. SG Records, thank you, my friend, your support. It says, I love Ermes. I love Engin. Best wishes, my friend. Thank you. Thank you very much, Roman. Thank you, Roman. You know Roman, right? Yeah. Yeah. Very beautiful video, eh? Yeah, yeah. Roman, you need to speak a little bit louder when you translate.
Engin Terzi: I don't see Lillie. You what? Arsene. Arsene Lillie. Oh, Arsene Lillie was going to come. He said in the last moment, he said, Engin, I have an emergency about business. He said, if you say to come, I will come. But
Engin Terzi: if you let me take care of the business, I will be happy. And I said, just, just focus on your business. I didn't really, I mean, I mean, it would be great if he would come, but if he has something to do, important business, you understand, no need to push the guy, you know, just come here, come here and forget about the business or something. I wouldn't want to do that. Yeah. To him, he's good, good, good friend of mine. Yeah. Yeah. I saw many discussion about your rank
Engin Terzi: You what? I saw many discussions about your rank. It just gives me so much headache. It makes my blood pressure go up. I don't want to even talk about it. No, enough, enough, enough. Every time I'm sick of blocking people.
Engin Terzi: Arsene needs to come, blocking is for different, different opinions, okay. But whenever they go, like, they don't know what they are talking about and they are using the wrong language. And so it is making me to use the wrong language as well. I don't want to do that, you know. I want to use my energy for organizing events for the arm-wrestling community, you understand? I don't have energy for, you know, drama, drama, drama, just forget it. All the drama, just go away. For now, yes.
Ermes Gasparini: No, I think too about the Russian athletes because they don't pull with us and it's impossible to put...
Engin Terzi: yes yes we will when the ban is finished I'm gonna invite Slayev just come you know Laletin come Arsen Liliev come Matushenko
Engin Terzi: And then they will pull, and then we will see the results, you know, why you need to be so much. I think some people are just looking for just argument. They are so bored, I think, in their life. They just need to just wait, wait. If we have this much of idea about the rankings today, it's just because I organized East versus West, so many matches happened. So it is when they are allowed to come, whenever we organize, we will see who is ranked where, you know, who is ranked where.
Engin Terzi: Now, like if you beat Jerry, you're going to rank direct the second place. I mean, you understand? Because you will prove that he's better than him. You are better than him. And then if someone else comes with, that is the logic. You like or you don't like. You beat the guy, you take the ranking. That's all. It is my ranking. You don't like, just ignore it. You like it, just follow it. It's okay. But this is the same logic that I used for many years when I ranked Devon Larratt number one.
Engin Terzi: Devon, out of nowhere, he just ranked number one because of beating John Bersink. But two years ago, he lost to Taras Iwaki. But nobody said that, hey, you have a bad record against Taras Iwaki. How can you rank above Taras Iwaki? So now they are saying, how can Jerry can rank above Dave? He has a bad record against him. So then Devon had the bad record. But then he was very happy when I ranked him number one. He was saying, oh, Engie, good job. You know, this is how it should be. You understand?
Engin Terzi: So just, I mean, anyway, so I don't want to go there. I and Devon talked yesterday, more than 30 minutes. We talked about everything. Everything is cool. We don't need anything. What I don't feel good, that you can be Devon fan. How many years you... Friends? With Devon friend or...
Engin Terzi: No, no, you do a ranking. I think, I don't remember, I don't remember, but probably near 10 years, near, a little bit less than 10 years. And the eSports news is... No, no, those people started after I said, okay, you know, I'm not going to do anymore. And then they call themselves experts. I don't know exactly how many people are there. I don't know what kind of expectation they have, but...
Engin Terzi: So they started after. For many years, I did it for, do you remember World of Armwrestling? Charlie Minnell from Sweden? Yeah. Those, I did the rankings there. I did the rankings for armpower.net, for Igor Mazurenko, I did. And then later, I also did it, I think, the exports, they were using my ranking, you understand? So I said, you know, just enough for me, headache, because, again, you know, people who knows, who doesn't know.
Engin Terzi: they all have some opinion. You understand? Opinion is okay, but they just tell you, hey, you don't know anything. You don't understand from our message. I was like, okay, I don't understand. That's okay. Justin forget about it. Anyway, so
Ermes Gasparini: how do you see you saw the after pool between Prudnik and Dadikian very good fight very good fight the match is already inside yes yes November November 19 yeah yeah Prudnik won but Dadikian it was 100 kilos
Engin Terzi: No, no, no. Dadikian was 102. Frutnik was 107, 5 kilos. And after the event, Frutnik went up to 110. And I'm sure Dadikian was 107 or something because he was so dry when he came. So he weighed on the morning of...
Engin Terzi: or that he can, I think that he can even, did he weigh in morning? Yeah, I think he weighed in morning, Friday morning, and then Saturday night he competed. So I'm sure because of water loss, you know, I think, I'm sure he was near 167, so three, four kilo in the competition time. But there are a lot of factors. The one is, Frutnik did not train specifically for his left arm because he didn't have a super match here.
Engin Terzi: But Dadikyan trained. But Dadikyan lost so much weight. And Dadikyan had a super match. But before Dadikyan, Prudnik pulled with Efe Komek for five, six matches. And then I think he pulled with, I think if I'm not mistaken, maybe with Zurab. Maybe, I don't remember. But I remember he pulled with someone else as well. And then he pulled Dadikyan. So...
Engin Terzi: When you consider that Dadikian's matches with Oleg Dzok was not so tough matches, but still set up this gripping. Yeah, yeah. But Prytnik also pulled some super matches right before pulled Dadikian. So I can say that the conditions are very close. So I think we're going to see a very good match. But there are limited weight. That is for world title. So 115 kilos. 115 kilos.
Engin Terzi: Fifteen. Fifteen, yeah. Yeah, yeah. 115 kilos I will put, yeah. And nothing more, because Bruton is going to be 115 for Michael Todd anyways. So... Michael Todd. Yeah, Michael Todd. He's very curious, this match. Fantastic. What did you say first? Very what? Very fantastic, this match.
Ermes Gasparini: Yes, yes. Interesting match. Because this match is difficult to predict. The style is very different. I think I've never seen Prudnik go in the press with a top.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that whenever I saw Prudnik with press, I thought that Bortolato could be dangerous for Dadikian because of his style. But just remember, if Dadikian would pull Bortolato, he would be about 10 kilo heavier, better shape. But still, it is harder, you know, to go that way. But whenever Bortolato is even stronger than Prudnik in shoulder press, you remember one round, you were like, okay, and then...
Ermes Gasparini: Very mistake. Yeah, mistake, yeah. You underestimated his pressure, right? Yeah. He's strong, right? Whenever he puts his shoulder, very strong, right? Yeah. It's very difficult to hold when he is over your arm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bortolato is very difficult to hold him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Impossible, I think.
Engin Terzi: So let's see, let's see. I just think that, you know, there was a lot of, you know, people think that I said this Prudnik versus Dadikian match because of what happens on the social media. Because Dadikian was kind of aggressive with Oleg Zok. Some people didn't like, some people said it is normal. After the match, I talked with Dadikian.
Engin Terzi: with his friend Bob Kane. He's a very good guy. Yeah. Very good guy, but when he felt too much adrenaline, he'd be crazy. Yeah. I kind of agree and disagree with that. Like, whenever I make myself... Oh, there is an ambulance. Whenever I make myself so focused and my opponent is very serious...
Engin Terzi: I make myself like, ready, go. But when I realize that opponent is not at my level, then I don't continue to be that aggressive. Yeah, me too. You understand, like, round one, he beat him easy, but round two, round three, he already knew that he could beat him easy, but he continued a little bit. So, yeah, I mean, I'm not going to criticize anything, but
Engin Terzi: social media was divided you know some says no good people even told me don't invite him again or something but i mean if he would physically do something that he wouldn't do it then i wouldn't invite but he is just because he was aggressive or something you cannot say that i mean if you don't like him
Ermes Gasparini: Beat him, if you can, you understand? I'm not going to exclude anyone because of that. I'm going to invite. I know, I know. And the match with Prokop, Moldavia, the Moldavia guys. Prokopcik? Yeah. And...
Ermes Gasparini: Another name I don't remember. Corey Miller? Yeah. He hold him like a very long time like this. Did you think this was offensive? Do you think that it was disrespect or you think that... Little bit you can do this, like this, but not too much.
Engin Terzi: Maybe, maybe, maybe he wanted to give him as much as chance, you know, just to, you know, try or something. See, everyone has different understanding of disrespect. Some people thought that, you know, screaming was disrespect.
Engin Terzi: you thought that screaming is normal because of the adrenaline. Some people think that, you know, that way about Prokop Trip and you think that it was like too much, you know? So we all have our own perspective. Yeah. Yeah. So after I put the, I put the video, and then people were just like more hype about that match. But people think that I said this match after the reaction of YouTube. No.
Engin Terzi: When we were in Istanbul, they already talked with each other. And then I talked with them for a super match. So there was a verbal agreement already about that match. It has nothing to do with what people show reaction is. And you remember my words.
Ermes Gasparini: when we talked about Dadikian and Oleg. No, no, Oleg is very strong because he goes like this, he top rolls. And I told you Dadikian is super strong, 3-0. Sure. Dadikian left is... I don't know where is his level, but...
Engin Terzi: I think top five in world class. Yeah. Anyway, so yeah, there are some incredible matches. Yeah. There are some other like Prudnik versus Michael Todd. Another match, what is it?
Engin Terzi: Michael Todd and Prudnik. And? Michael Todd, Prudnik. Yeah, yeah. You said it's an interesting match, remember? Yeah. I think Michael Todd will win 3-2. You think Michael Todd will win? Yeah, for his endurance. Because interesting thing is even Michael Todd stopped even
Engin Terzi: the hit of Pushkar. Of course that we don't know what shape of Michael will come. But just remember when Michael beat Pushkar years ago, about 10 years ago or something, he was light, he was 118 kilo. And I was like, you don't think that you should gain some weight? And he said, no, Engin, I feel very strong.
Engin Terzi: And then he really beat him. Yeah, 6-0, he really beat him. This time, he is around that weight again. He sometimes even go down to 247 or something. But the match will be 253, which is 115 kilos. So, I don't know. Sometimes, you know, Ermes, when you gain so much weight...
Engin Terzi: your body gets tired. You understand? You think that you are big, you are strong, but your body is so tired. You understand? So sometimes when you lose some weight, unnecessary weight, unnecessary weight, you can be more healthy and your body may be reacting healthier and stronger. So we will see. We will see how they match. But it is not that easy. Evgeny Michael loses weight.
Engin Terzi: like to say Gennady, to Revaz, still it is not possible to hold him and do this. He stops you. Somewhere he stops you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So if he stops Krutnik, how do you think that it will be? If Krutnik don't go in pressure and he don't take his wrist, it's very difficult to beat him.
Engin Terzi: Michael Todd. Yeah, just one second, let me. Yeah, just one second, I need to put this on charger. Okay, anyways.
Engin Terzi: If you don't do a press, it's very difficult to beat Michael Dawkins. If you don't do shoulder pressure, it's very hard. But how many times did you compete with the Europeans and Wavs? You don't remember, right? 2009, Europeans, when Prudnik and Pascal pulled. Prudnik? Prudnik?
Engin Terzi: And Pascal, Pascal Girard. Pascal, ah, the longest match in history. Do you remember that match? Pascal took his wrist and then Prudnik was like this. Long match, like what, eight minutes or something? More? More, maybe more. I don't know. I was there, but I don't remember exactly. Yeah, but Prudnik was able to pull that way. I think he won. I think he won.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah. I don't know, because it's very... Michael Todd is very smart to change for the transition, you understand? To go up and go in the press. Do you know how old is Brutnik? 34 or something? Now? Yeah. 24, I think. 34. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Maybe I will meet him in Germany. No, no, no. Do you know how old is he? His age? Yeah, 34. Okay, so he pulled 13 years ago, so he was like 21 years old. Yeah, then, okay. He's a lot. Yeah. Do you know the guy, Leonidas or something?
Ermes Gasparini: Very strong. Seriously? No. In wrestling, I don't know. I don't think there are not this level. But I follow him on Instagram. And with the street cool, bench press, lift, every exercise is super, super strong. Like...
Engin Terzi: Very weak. Yes. 24 years old, eh? He's 135 kilos, yeah. Yeah. Do you know who suggested me him? Devon. Devon told me to set him with Wagner Bortolato, with left arm. With Leonidas? Yeah. Do you think he... No. Wagner would be too much, right? Yeah, too much. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, yeah. He's famous, Leonidas in German, yeah? Maybe I will meet him. I don't even know who he was, you know, because I think he is the Larry Wills type of armwrestler. I think he is like something else, but also time-to-time armwrestling, not really armwrestling, but yeah. You saw, you see?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw him, yeah. After Devon sent me his Instagram link and then, yeah, he was thinking that, yeah. Maybe I will meet him and Prudnik next week. In Germany? In Germany, because I have a seminar in Germany next week. Yeah, that's good, that's good, yeah. Mask him, ask him, you know, maybe just call him from WhatsApp, call me.
Engin Terzi: I can talk to Tim. Maybe we offer him a match. Supermatch. Let's see. But we need to find a good opponent. We need to be fair with those guys. If they are interested, we don't want to just put like Wagner. I think, as you said, it would be too much. But Wagner, does he have a match with Tobias or not?
Engin Terzi: Oh, Wagner? I may change that match, Tobias' match. I may set Tobias with right arm with Di Dzeranov and Di Dzeranov with left arm with Wagner Bortolato. Di Dzeranov now is good shape or... I mean, he's young, you know. He has more than three months. I'm sure he's training, but
Engin Terzi: Three months is a good time to get in super shape. It depends if you don't train too much. My friend, when I was young, just give me one month, I was in very good shape when I was young.
Engin Terzi: Now for the seven, it's hard, but it's not because of the time, it's because of the injuries, injuries, you know. I really, joint doesn't handle. If joint handles, the muscle is handling, but the joint doesn't handle. But those guys are rock. They are very strong guys. Three months, you know, you just... I mean, I am not setting him against Levan or something. Yeah. September, October, November, three months. Yeah, three months and...
Engin Terzi: What's today? 13 or 14? Today is 14, right? 14 August, yeah. Yeah, so 95 days or something, yeah. How do you see the Dzeranov and Tobias, right arm? I saw Tobias very, very strong last time. No.
Ermes Gasparini: Last time he won this, I don't remember. Who fight Hengi? Tobias. He lost Barbosa. Barbosa hook him. And with left arm, he beat Prudnik. Ah.
Ermes Gasparini: Left is very, very strong. They told me. And right with Serrano is very interesting. Because Serrano, his hand is not very strong. And maybe Tobias takes his wrist and the match continues like this. With right arm? Yeah. I think it will be a good match. Very good match.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Do you remember, do you remember when Ajumrat Oleg was in very good shape, he pulled with the Dzeranov? Do you remember? The Dzeranov weighed him in the hook like this, weighed it, weighed it. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and then Toprol, he was just like this, you know, just. Yeah. No, it's normal, you know, Oleg was only 90 kilo, but not many people can do the Oleg like that. Yeah, yeah, not many people, but. No.
Ermes Gasparini: But Dzeranov, he lost last time in Russia, I don't remember, the tournament. Maybe this... Yeah, yeah, I remember, I remember, yeah. Yeah. And, yeah, from now on, I'm thinking that
Engin Terzi: I'm not going to set Prudnik so often in 110 kilo. I think that I plan to do more in supra weight category, sometimes under 10 kilo, but most of the times against the supra weight. I think like how Levan is too much for supra weight. I think that Prudnik is too much for under 110 kilo. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, after Tatasic's match, I don't know what to say, you know, like to beat Tatasic like that, just lost on control and then beat like this. Like, I mean, Tatasic is super strong person, you know, super, you know, he's just like, yeah, incredible side pressure, you know, but Prudnik was kind of too much. So I'm just saying, I think that it is time for Prudnik to compete super away and be beat, what's his name? Italian gladiator, what's his name?
Ermes Gasparini: Devon't remember. It's very interesting if he competes in Super Heavyweight. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe in January you will be... Yeah. Yeah. But let's see. Let's see if he loses to Michael. Evgeny if he loses to Michael, he would.
Engin Terzi: There are not many people under 110 kilos to beat him. No. Yeah, today, today, something funny happened today. Michael Todd sent me a message from WhatsApp. He said, Engin, I heard that next year, Prudnik and Devon
Engin Terzi: may pull at East vs West and he says does it mean that I will have a title match with Devon he said since he said he's gonna beat Prudnik Michael said that Michael is gonna beat Prudnik so it means that is true or not oh no I mean it's like this like this I and Devon talk and Devon said I promise you that I will come to East vs West but I don't tell you the timing this is what he said
Engin Terzi: But the match that I offered him was Brutnik, and we talked about the Brutnik. But, of course, you know, Devon is also like me, 46, 47, around, you understand, that age, many years pulling. It is normal that these guys to pick opponents, you understand, when you are so famous, so many years. So if he says that, you know, I'm coming to East versus West, but I will pull this guy, you understand, I wouldn't tell him no, you understand? So, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Which is, yeah, I mean, but his promise is to come to Istanbul and pull there, not to pull this guy, that guy. But when we talk with him, we talk about how the match would go, him and Prudnik. And he said, Prudnik is very dangerous. And he put Prudnik right here to Brazil, he says, because of his, you know, so many different direction he's pulling up. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: How do you think that, you know, if Brodnyk gains weight, he's 120 kilos, do you think that he would have a chance to pull against, like he already beat Morozov? Do you think that... Now Morozov is in a very different shape. Yeah, I try to tell people this too. In six months... Now I think it's very different now. Yes, he's different, but if I had money...
Engin Terzi: since they don't have a match right now. So as an organizer, I can say my opinion. If I had money, if both are ready, I would still put money on Prudnik. If he was 115, 118 kilo, I know Morozov is 130 kilo, but still in my opinion, Prudnik. People may say to them, why you rank Prudnik lower? Because when Prudnik beat him in February, Morozov was not in top 10. Morozov was outside of top 10.
Ermes Gasparini: So let's see, let's see how it will be. But like, for example, Gennady versus Prudnik would be a good match or interesting match? Yes. Yes? Or Dave Chaffee. Dave Chaffee and Prudnik? Yeah, this is super. Yeah. Dave Chaffee with Prudnik was a super, super match. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: More than Moroldo and Gennady. Yeah. My friends, whenever you ask something, you want to do something, why you say, we want this, we want this? Like you are only one person, you know, just why you say we want, you know, like how many person, I respect you, I respect your request, but why you need to feel like we want, you know, when you want something, like how many people are you representing? That surprises me. That's why I'm asking my friends.
Engin Terzi: I wanted to invite, I couldn't reach Alexey Voivode. I don't have any contact. I don't have friendship with him. I mean, when I say I don't have friendship, you see, we know each other. We say hello, but I don't know him personally. So I don't have any contact. Let's see how it will be. Let's see. Let's see, Ermes. And that's a very important match for you coming. I kind of see that match.
Ermes Gasparini: as a ticket for the Le Mask match. Yeah. Yeah. I have really adrenaline now. Yeah? Now I'm more happy because my mind is focused on the match.
Ermes Gasparini: training for, you know, if you have a match, if you set a match, you train, you have more passion, you understand, to do this. If you don't have a match, yes, you train, but not with very fire and focus to grow your level.
Engin Terzi: But now are you making your plans to only Jerry or you are making a little bit longer plan like to Jerry first and then this? So the preparation that you started now is a long preparation or training for first Jerry and then Levan? Or now you are only, your training is limited to only Jerry match?
Ermes Gasparini: If I'm playing Levan 2, in my... For example, are you making now your plans for three months or just say for five, six months? Now for free. For free? Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. And after that, I play immediately if I win this Levan. Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: I think if I come with a good shape, I have a good chance to beat Zari. Because I saw many times the match with Gennady and he underestimated too much Zari for me.
Ermes Gasparini: because he continued holding him like this and Jari continued press, press, press and the endurance went out if Gennady pulled like the first round immediately maybe the first and second round he won I don't know the first but the
Ermes Gasparini: First or second round, I'm not sure. And the second match, he underestimated too much because you saw, no? The character, no? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Too much confidence. And he held him and Jari continued like this. And when he tried to pull this side, he don't have enough power to go on.
Ermes Gasparini: the winning position. This is a big problem. Yeah. I lose every time when I underestimated my opponent, I lose. Every time. Me too. So you learn to not underestimate anyone at that level. Same when I fought Alex, very big mistake. Stronger, but...
Ermes Gasparini: This is the sport. Yeah. But do you think that when you said at the beginning of this program, your 85% is enough to beat Jerry? Is it a little bit underestimated? I don't talk about my shape, my mind.
Engin Terzi: Oh, okay. Your mind. My mind is already too much fire now. Yeah, but when you say that your 85% is enough for him, that's also coming from your mind. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, so that is, you know, also, okay, whatever. I'm not gonna push you so much about this question. Yeah, it will be, yeah, great, great, great. Yeah, I think that you better do a good homework. Good homework because, like, just that guy is, you win or not, is different.
Engin Terzi: Not someone that you can meet like around, you understand? It's different. Very specialist, you know, about this thing. Different, you know? So if you didn't do good homework, and it is very bad that you realize this at that moment, because you don't have a chance to go back home and train another month and come back, you know? You understand? So that moment, you really need to be ready for everything. Because if you lose...
Engin Terzi: I don't think that people are going to give you another chance to pull him again. There are a lot of matches, a lot of matches. Like, honestly, Gennady wants to pull you again. Gennady? Yeah, he wants to pull you again. Kurdeca wants to pull Dave. And Gennady now wants to pull Jerry. You would like to beat Alex.
Engin Terzi: So everyone is just looking for like, you know, you know, hey, you know. It is not easy to get a second chance. There needs to be some time, like one year. Remember me with my mask, you remember. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, yeah. After two years. Two years, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, it was two years and also because of also there was COVID in 2020. One year, nothing, you know, happened in our nursing home. But what I'm just saying that it will be, if you lose to Jerry, it will be difficult to get a rematch. Yeah, it's difficult, but maybe...
Engin Terzi: There are other athletes like Alex, JP, there are another possibility to fight again. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think at one point we will see you guys are pulling rematches, revenge matches, but now still there are many matches that people didn't see. It is too early for the revenge matches until...
Engin Terzi: both guys beat everyone, everyone, everyone. And people think, okay, now it's time for them to pull again. You understand? But before that, yeah. But like, just tell, I will tell you,
Engin Terzi: And if you lose it two times. Oh, too bad, too bad. Like me losing Arthur, but the second match with bicep injury, but still the guy beat me twice. So it is just like, no good to ask the third one. But if I would want, I can set it because I got injured. Everyone knows it, but still it doesn't mean people will be like, you know, okay, again, you know,
Engin Terzi: You know, the other one. So, and also more important thing, you have a dream to pull against Levan. Whenever I said, you know, Jerry is a ticket to pull Levan, there is one smart that's right, you know, be serious or something. He knows our message so much. You know, he's educating me, you know, because I'm new. Anyway.
Engin Terzi: In the past, I was getting angry. Now I just look at them and laugh at them. But when I said tickets, just imagine this. If you lose Jerry, who would set you with Lewa?
Engin Terzi: Nobody. If you lose Jerry, just forget about Levan, minimum for one year. Until 2024, nobody is going to set you with Levan. So that is what I meant when I said ticket. But the guy probably understood from his ask what to do about this. Anyway, so I don't know. I don't know. A lot of matches. Now the Russians are coming. Vitaly is coming. Slav is coming. Now we will see how it goes.
Engin Terzi: Maybe Danish come back. Yeah, I talked with Babken. You know Babken? I talked with him. Yesterday we talked not one hour, but a long time. And then he told me about the condition of Danish. He says that Danish is in love with arm wrestling so much and he wants to come back. You know, Danish wants so much. He said he loves it, you know. And so we will see. But what I wanted to ask you,
Engin Terzi: Do you realize that, especially in early rounds, and especially when you try to top-roll him right away, Dave looks very dominant? You know, in the early rounds, when you try to go outside with him, you know, when Gennady tried to go outside, you know, it was not successful. So how do you... Alex, Kordesha also tried to top-roll him, and, you know, it didn't end up good. But Alex, he...
Engin Terzi: It's too weak side pressure. I understand. But if you realize that Dave didn't go like this, but they also pronated. Yeah. Yeah. But how do you see Dave against, uh, Lalletin? I don't know, but I think the first match we win Dave. You think Dave? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Maybe the first part, Laletin go a little down, but after that, Dave go to the wing. Baba, do you think that Laletin's endurance is that good? Like same horsepower? Do you see Laletin, someone like Gennady and Morozov, you know, or he's also, you know, technical puller. So do you think that
Ermes Gasparini: Do you think that La Lettine is in the category of more like Alex Kurdesha type of, you know, technical puller or in the category of like Morozov and Gennady with the horsepower? No, no. La Lettine, he has good horsepower. You think he has? No. It's Kurdesha type. Yeah, but if he loses a little bit here, Ruiz is very difficult for him to beat.
Ermes Gasparini: Dave I don't know but because now Dave for me he said too many matches too much in the short time for me it's not good I will tell you something just like that thing is really interesting to me when you say like so many matches in 90s
Engin Terzi: 90s, early 2000s, like we were competing many, many tournaments, you know, like sometimes I competed seven, eight category in two days. Today competing. Yeah, yeah. And tomorrow in America, many tournaments. You can say that they were not like this level, but whenever you are 60, 63 kilo and competing, it was super weight. And then you competing today and the next day again, many category. I mean, it's like, I don't understand it. How someone...
Ermes Gasparini: cannot be ready to pull two months later, you know. That part is just like... I'm very lucky for my genetics, but my genetics is... I feel too much pain. I don't know how to explain this, but...
Ermes Gasparini: I needed to recover. Yeah, when I fought with Gennady after Kurdeca, only three weeks, but after Gennady, I remember I felt pain for one month. But just remember, remember, you pulled Alex Kurdeca, and three weeks later you pulled Gennady, and then two months later you pulled Arif,
Engin Terzi: And after Arif, two months later, you pulled Wagner Bortolato, but with right arm you didn't pull, but you said your right arm was your best ever shape. So from November to the April, five months, and then at the end of the five months, you said you were in the best ever shape of your life. Yeah. So, I mean, I think that as long as you are not injured or something, it's possible. It looks possible. Yeah. Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: Now I feel a little pain. When you train maybe for one year, you don't feel nothing, pain, injury like this. Maybe after one year, for three more, you have a pain. After this, you have a good time for training. It's like this, no?
Engin Terzi: not every time good shape and good without pain yeah yeah yeah yeah and people people think that like you have been inactive in fact you you we cannot say that you have been inactive but you are um you just like for example if in may if they would beat gennady in august you were gonna pull
Engin Terzi: The only reason that you didn't pull in August, because you didn't want to pull Gennady twice in eight, nine months, you know, because you just pull him and again, you know? Yeah. But, but if, if Gennady would be Jerry, you were going to put, you were going to pull him in November because it was going to be one year. So, yeah. So you are, you are ready. You have been ready, you know, like as long as somebody invites you, as long as the offer is okay, you know, then acceptable, you're ready to pull, you know? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah so what's your opinion you think the laletin is gonna beat dave that's what you are saying laletin no laletin i think they will win they will win you think yeah like six rounds match they will win yeah
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, maybe it's difficult, but I'm sure the first, second match, maybe third, Dave will win. After this, I don't know the endurance. Maybe Daleti will win the last match, but I think the first match will win Dave.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you remember, do you remember in Dubai when you did the practice with Laletin and you were like,
Engin Terzi: head to head with him, you were so happy because at that time, at that time, you didn't know your level. Your last match, you lost to Matt Mask at WAL and then you were trying to become the best. And now I remember you were just so happy. You were like, you know, it was like my dream, you know. Yeah, you remember, yeah. And now look at where you are. Look at, look at, you are just like right, right here.
Engin Terzi: And you are looking opportunity to pull Levan. Let's see. I want to hear what Jerry is thinking as well. I would like to host him, not very soon, but I would like to host him. And I want to hear what he thinks. I'm going to ask him what he thinks about your opinion about the 85% will be enough for him.
Engin Terzi: a little bit friendly friendly provocation is good yeah yes my friend so maybe um i let you go so you eat because you need to eat seven times a day yeah i'm yeah i'm already angry hungry angry angry angry is me

Engin Terzi: Two months later. I want to work his mind. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. When he come in Istanbul like this with me. Oh, he will be shaking? He will be afraid of you? Yeah. Yeah? By the way, whenever you grip up with him in Istanbul, after we eat, like, did you feel very solid? His hands very strong? Different.
Engin Terzi: it's difficult to say right it's only in the air you hold it no power nothing right yeah yeah but i mean like in fact who cares about jerry's hand he doesn't care he's ready to give you he will be even happy to give you you know yeah the the problem is somewhere else the problem is somewhere else with his pressure yeah
Ermes Gasparini: For me, I don't think, I don't imagine my situation like this and not go down. It's impossible to me. Impossible, yeah. In your opinion? My arm closed like this, for me, it's impossible.
Ermes Gasparini: So in your opinion, if you take everything like this? If I take his wrist with arm closed, full power, my best position is difficult to imagine he hold me like this. I understand. Yeah, this is it.
Ermes Gasparini: I understand. And I have many styles. So you are saying that you don't do, you don't need to do anything special where you are strong. Maybe with press, yeah. To the end? At the end? Yeah. Maybe if I want if I want to to don't pull too much my arm I want to to
Ermes Gasparini: I don't... It's difficult to explain. If I wanted to have more endurance, maybe I go in the press. Not immediately, but... So you are saying that after you take, you will hit, hit, hit, bring, and then turn around, and then... No, my friend. What do you do? No, hit, hit. One hit is already... Enough.
Engin Terzi: So if one is enough, why do you need it? Listen, listen, listen. You are the one who said you're going to do shoulder pressure. And now you are saying that you don't need one hit is enough. Yeah. Do you need shoulder pressure or no? Maybe. When I fight with him, it depends if I want or not. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Okay, let's see, let's see, let's see how it will be. Let's see how it will be. I will ask Jerry as well. Yeah. And then whenever, whenever, maybe, maybe I will cut these parts from the video. Whenever I chat with him, I will make him listen. What do you think about it? You know, you know, you know, we, we, our masters are, I mean, like family. We have a map.
