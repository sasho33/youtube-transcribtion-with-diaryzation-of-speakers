Ivan Matyushenko: Vanya, are you going to Chechnya? In English?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, because in Guinness already here. Why do I not hear you guys very well? I'm not sure that I go there. Okay. Well, I... I play it from... Can you hear something like earphone or something? I don't hear anything. I hardly hear you guys. Justin one second. We hear you.
Krasimir Kostadinov: I have no idea why. I checked about flights to Chechnya, but I cannot go there. There are no flights from Bulgaria, Turkey or from Romania. There are no flights to Russia right now. But you can go from Turkey to Russia.
Krasimir Kostadinov: yeah but i checked and now it's not possible it's true expensive no there were no flights i checked and there were no flights maybe from georgia uh it is possible to get uh it is not far from
Ivan Matyushenko: from Georgii. Chechnya is very close to it. Let's see. About 200 kilometers from Georgii. Okay. But there are big fuses there. Okay. I will have this in mind. Oh, Artyom.
Engin Terzi: hey christmas speak english so people can people can understand it's a challenge
Ivan Matyushenko: And Gim, do you hear now? That's what I wanted from the beginning. Do I hear you? So today we're discussing 19th of November, right? Sorry? We're discussing 19th of November, right?
Ivan Matyushenko: yeah i think so yeah i i think so engine called me five minutes ago yeah me too me too did you compete at engines uh uh east west yes once once you
Krasimir Kostadinov: yes uh vanya i don't know why but when you start to speak and it's cutting it's it starts it stop start stops and it's hard to hear you i don't know why no idea yeah it's breaking up yep so hello guys hi again good to see you guys so
Engin Terzi: So how have you been, Ivan? Long time no see you. Great, thank you. Getting ready for future competitions. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Justin believe me, you know me, I'm doing my best. And I will do it that way or this way, I will do it. But just believe me, I'm doing my best. Never doubt. I'm getting ready for that time.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That needs to be fixed. I mean, Krasimir, that everyone needs to step up so you can you can just say that, OK, like, I'm the best, right? Why should I say this? No, no, no. I'm not talking about you. Generally, that everyone should like when they are allowed and then everybody competes. And then then we find out once we say that, hey, you cannot play, you know, to this, you know, and then it is.
Krasimir Kostadinov: uh hard to hard to i don't know i don't know something is missing you don't feel that way i don't know i i think that right now arm wrestling is going up again just it's very pity that the russians and the georgians are not allowed to pull here and there and it's not nice
Engin Terzi: Yeah, this is what I was talking about. And then now in Istanbul, Georgii have been pulling. And so then, you know, Kazakhs have been pulling. And then once we have people like Ivan and many others, like Arsen Liliyev, after nine years, I convinced him to come back. He was just so ready, so motivated. He was training. He's sending me pictures every week.
Engin Terzi: how is it progressing and don't don't show everywhere but how is the progress and he's getting better and better and now because they may take him to army so he kind of lost motivation so it's just like okay i don't want to go into there but um yeah so personally i'm not talking about the politics the war or something i'm against the war what's happening there but personally i i miss our friends you know that's all i just tried to say
John Brzenk: When you say this, maybe it's time to say rest in peace to Ilya Izman. Oh, yeah. Today he passed away, right? Yes. Yeah, yeah. I understand. Yeah. Anyway, so Artem, where did you find the T-shirt? Oh, don't worry. I have my people. I have my people. I've been a great supporter. If this was less, I have a T-shirt.
Engin Terzi: Is that a signed t-shirt? Yes, yes, it's a signed t-shirt. It has all the signatures. You put a signed t-shirt on you, and then if you wash it, you know what's going to happen to those signatures. Do you think I own a washing machine engine? I'm not that rich. That's never going to be washed. Come on. Okay. So let's talk about the upcoming East vs. West. And first of all, congratulations, Krasimir. When everyone said that, you know, Krasimir is over, and then you...
Engin Terzi: resurrected again you know and and congratulations for your win thank you anyway so ivan a long time we haven't talked except you know right into each other um how do you find this east versus west cards well every time it is better and better except that russians are not allowed
Engin Terzi: perhaps well the card is better and better yes it's more interesting every time so we're going to watch it on 19th of november yeah yeah yeah yeah and do you do you find this card the level is really high um
Ivan Matyushenko: It's difficult to compare, because previous events were also very good. But perhaps even more interesting matches every time. So every time is... Well, perhaps I'm waiting for this event more than for the previous one. But also, I enjoyed all of them. You enjoyed all of them, yeah. That's good that you enjoyed, yeah.
Engin Terzi: and and and whoa and so let let's let's and you cross it um do you like are you waiting with excitement this one in every card there are a few matches that excites me so
Engin Terzi: i'm not interested at all of them but in every card there are three four matches that makes me really want to see that yeah yeah yeah yeah just let me get a phone or do uh so i can follow do you follow the chat artem or no no but i can pull it up whatever yeah if you say a super chat or something just let me know i don't have my phone yeah yeah and and uh what are those matches
Krasimir Kostadinov: uh right now i want to see ermes versus dave yeah john versus petrenko very curious about mask versus sandres also i may miss some of the matches that i want to see now because i don't remember it all right now but these three
Engin Terzi: So you are not curious about Devon versus Sputnik, huh? I forgot about that one. Yeah, that one. How could you forget? I really hope that we will see Devon pulling over the table. No, no, no. It's not allowed. This is okay. This is okay. I know for you, even this may not be okay. But this, the down angle, who matters? This is not okay. At the...
Engin Terzi: neutral and losing position not in the winning position you know it can go down it's not a problem but but for the neutral and losing position the home response will not be okay down and if you want yeah okay go ahead and uh morozo versus gasparini left sounds very interesting also and morozo versus uh revas is not
Engin Terzi: it should be also it should be also yes yeah if we start talking about it all of them will become that's true that's true anyways and and ivan which matches are you looking for the most uh larat prudnik maybe maybe um most interesting
Ivan Matyushenko: Morozov against Lutidze and right-hand Gasparini. Dave Chaffee. Yes, well, almost all of them. For instance, Dzeranov against Bortolato also. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you have pulled against Bortolato as well, right? In the past? Well, I think I beat him right-hand.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yeah. But his right was always weaker than his left. Dave you pulled his left? I think he's the five times world champion left hand. Yeah. Dave you pulled him with left arm? Dave you pulled him with left arm? No. Only right hand. Baba, you were in the same category with left arm with him? I do not remember actually. Perhaps... Whenever you beat him, right arm? Well, I think it was Kazakhstan...
Engin Terzi: 2011 uh 11 or 12. 11 11 11 12 was brazil yeah um yeah i understand so let's let's talk about the matches let's start from zura versus ryan bowen i believe zura is too much for ryan i understand
Ivan Matyushenko: And Ivan? Sorry, I didn't hear you. Zurab Tavberidze versus Ryan Bowen. Right arm. Well, I think that Zurab is more experienced. He is stronger. But looking at Ryan, he has
Ivan Matyushenko: become bigger perhaps and stronger also i do not know how he who he trains with um but i saw him several years ago and now and now he's bigger and obviously stronger so um well i think that's a rob will win but um who knows yeah he is he is 15 kilo ryan is 15 kilo heavier than three months ago right now when he came to istanbul
John Brzenk: was 88.7 and now he says he's 103 point something yeah so he's much bigger yeah so arthur why are you laughing uh it just uh there is an opinion uh that we talked about how ryan is getting stronger but he's also getting bigger so it's like it's kind of like the opposite of what he is trying to accomplish i understand so
Engin Terzi: So let's go, I mean, you both are, how to say, very knowledgeable, very experienced, and has a long career, and familiar, most likely, both East and West, so that is easier for me to talk. Because whenever I talk with very deep Eastern guys, they don't know much about the Western guys. Whenever, when I talk about the deep Western guys, they don't know much about the
Engin Terzi: eastern guys so it's hard to ask them predictions because sometimes they know one guy but no idea about other guys so they can compare so uh mindagas tarasaitis justin bishop krasimir we didn't hear artyom's opinion about ryan bowen versus you're right you're right artem uh oh
John Brzenk: well i am i'm agreeing with you guys that the rob is a way more experienced overall yeah he's a bigger guy in general i think too so yeah i i don't think it's going to be a match
John Brzenk: i understand how i think like there could be a logic of like chance beads a wrap and ryan be a chance but like i think there's like levels adjusted and stuff so yeah i think ryan is getting killed okay i i thought that you were gonna be nice as a influencer you know to your anyways
Krasimir Kostadinov: And Mindaugas versus Justin Bishop Krasimir? It's right arm, right? Right arm, yes. Right arm, I would say that Mindaugas is a huge favorite. If it was left arm, I would say Justin is a huge favorite. But with right arm, I believe it's all day for Mindaugas. Mindaugas is 75-76 kg. Justin will be 82 kg on the scale. And he will be around 85 on the competition day.
Krasimir Kostadinov: there will be about 10 kilo difference oh i don't know that actually but it will not matter i don't know i don't know so you still think it's a huge favor in douglas i think no no if it's 85 kilos justin then then it may be 50 50. okay and evan um sorry uh bishop tracetes
Ivan Matyushenko: uh unfortunately i'm not um uh i haven't seen uh bishop uh much uh but i saw tracitis only so i cannot estimate this uh fight okay you okay and and artem i'm going with justin on this one uh three two okay
John Brzenk: Yeah, I was thinking, I was thinking Mid-August is the guy because Justin have not competed, uh, in a long time, but kind of watching, I did a lot of research watching of Mid-August competition. And I, I think Justin got it. I think stylistically it's a, it's a pretty good match. I understand. And so, and then let's go for, uh,
Krasimir Kostadinov: I would say Dzeranov. It may be a good match, but in my eyes, Dzeranov is the favorite. Much more experience, raw power, they may be equal, but I believe the experience will be too much. If the match is equal, Dzeranov will win.
Ivan Matyushenko: And Ivan? Dzeranov, Kalinichenko. Yeah. Well, I think that Dzeranov is the favorite. Perhaps he is both stronger and more versatile. So I will bet on Dzeranov. Dzeranov. Okay. I see. I see. Yeah. And Artem?
Engin Terzi: i agree i agree with the guys too yeah i think geronoff is a bigger guy overall too and as ivan said more versatile i think it's yeah i'm going with georgie i understand and so petrenko versus raptor there is a left arm crossing they they pull in 2018 i think uh europeans drop one in the wars uh uh petrenko one left arm
Krasimir Kostadinov: and so they petrenko will be around 105 kilo zurab is about 100 kilo how do you see that match i see petrenko is the favorite do you expect a hook match i'm not sure actually because petrenko is good top rolling but also very strong in hook so i'm not sure if this will be top roll match or hook versus hook but uh
Krasimir Kostadinov: Justin the hand control from Petrenko would be too much for Zurab. Too much? You mean that when you say too much, do you expect a dominance? No, no, no. I'm sure it will be a close match. I'm sure it will be a close match. Justin I think that Petrenko will be always with better cupping and maybe he will be able to top-roll Zurab's hand.
Ivan Matyushenko: I believe long matches, but Petrenko to win at the end. Do you expect a close match? Maybe, but anyway, quite a confident win of Petrenko. I think with a side move.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yes, with a bit of top roll, yes. What if they end up in a really deep hook? I do not think it will happen, actually. But if it happens, perhaps the same. Well, they're close, but Petrenko perhaps a little stronger. Still, even if they go into a hook, you are saying that
Engin Terzi: will be a close match but still petrinko will win yes because of his side pressure yes i understand and artem yeah i think oleg wins it uh significantly whatever inside outside okay so you all are thinking that you know oleg is gonna win here okay so let's go to another match and do you guys know adam warzynski krasimir no actually you don't know anything
Engin Terzi: you know do you know ivan adam morzinski uh sorry once again and adam morzinski the guy who is pulling unfortunately not you know okay okay yeah i think you mean you could have a conversation artem i think you are the best guy here to give the uh someone someone from east but who lives in west so just
Engin Terzi: please inform us and do you know who is he do you know that guy yeah i mean i'm the one who said the match yeah but i know but uh maybe somebody told you that he's good but i am curious i have been following him already
Engin Terzi: and then after his last win against paul talbot and then people also suggested me and i asked to ask and follow all of his videos and then i i decided to set this match i mean do you think that i would just say okay engine a match with this guy oh okay okay i said okay it is your opponent come on no they just may tell you that this is the best guy in u.s under 80 kilos for example
Engin Terzi: What's that? I don't know. Maybe just they told you this is the best guy. Do you think that type of guy that would just act in the set a match just because somebody told me something? Do you think I wouldn't do my search and everything? Come on.
Engin Terzi: Depends who tells you this. It doesn't matter. You should have known me already. I like to control things. Artem knows me. I just know that this guy has huge forearms. His forearms look impressive. If you want to talk about him, the most important part is that he has incredible endurance. Once the match stops, incredible endurance and especially in hook.
Engin Terzi: so ojidar hook and andrews adam bigger hook and incredible andrews they call him even like medium-sized larat about the endurance so war i expect like two minutes war and but artem artem will give us the best opinion you know
John Brzenk: You're right. Well, because of the stylistically, right? Because neither one of them really want to go to the pad, right? They don't really, like, they're not very offensive. Adam can be, but with the way Bozhidar pulls, the match will stop. So, yeah, it is going to be a nice inside match. And I just was trying to do a prediction video. I think I went with Bozhidar.
John Brzenk: that's because last time i bet against uh adam he ended up uh he ended up i told him that he gonna get crushed and he printed what i typed and he taped it on his bathroom wall so he was reading it every morning and then he crushed the guy so i think i don't know if it's gonna happen again or not but
John Brzenk: i'm going with bojadar but yeah i'm that's the most exciting match for me because like i think yeah i think the stylistically is going to be my opinion it will be the longest match of the night in my opinion well i think it depends how well adam really matches up uh with power against bojadar right because that is not a crusher that often you will see him in a hook world
Engin Terzi: I can tell you 10 guys in last one year, Bozhidar had a hook work. Bozhidar is great about hooking a guy. But once he hooks, he is great. If the guy is top roller, he finishes easy. But if the guy has decent hook, Bozhidar still wins, but after a battle. The guy is bigger. They agreed at 92 kilo.
Engin Terzi: and i'm sure that the guy will be 95 on the competition day because friday morning is the way in saturday night is the evening i kind of feel that he has enough power to stop
John Brzenk: bojidar and then if they say as they say that he has endorsed and we will see a big war this this is what what i expect he definitely stops it is the the match definitely stops yeah it's we will just we don't really know how far how long will it go to the first one quick question for you is adam really known with his endurance in u.s no i have i have never heard of adam as an endurance guy
John Brzenk: Oh, okay. That's not what people told me. Maybe from the area, because I don't, it just like, I've seen Adam compete on every big card. I think he was a part of, I was a part of, and I think he just, he just a lot stronger than the guys, but I've never yet to see him really like to be known to like sit there from many classes. He just, he is a lot stronger than the guy for a lot of parts. So he will appear like he has the endurance.
Engin Terzi: do you remember him in a like the stop match and then getting out of gas no i think he gets so much stronger you know i mean that's fine but not the strongest but in a stop match um
John Brzenk: no because there's that there is not that many people i think that were able to give him that that you know i mean to be in it right because normally he stops people and he wars them out and he gasses them out right people told me that he's a slow guy he's not he's they say that his only problem is he's not a quick guy so that is why every match he needs to stop the guys the man stops
John Brzenk: and then he beats them okay it just style it just stylistically you you might call it endurance i will not i guess it's he's just a slow catcher type guy but i don't you know i will not really call it endurance for endurance you have to sit with somebody that's just as strong with you for like a couple minutes in it and then you know we can talk about endurance
John Brzenk: i every time i've seen adam arm so he's just been so much stronger than the guy and that's why he's just able to hold it and like just beat them i never seen him to be like out of out of endurance somebody other guys like pauline if i don't misremember they told me that his endurance is very good but probably you are thinking different so let's go to the another match uh david samusha versus uh daniel prokopchuk
Engin Terzi: oh this is very close one it's 50 50 for for me i cannot call it yeah see alex 1750 said that yeah at the olympia event last year he had some long hook wars
Engin Terzi: or the yeah 5050 you say yes Danny I said that he will be around 82 kilo in the competition day and the matches at 85 kilo category yeah yeah a lot of people till now whenever I checked the customer they said
Engin Terzi: Samushia is going to win. But last two days, whenever I talk with people, they are telling me that Samushia is going to win. And then you are one of them that also, you are not saying, not Samushia, they said Daniel is going to win last two days, including Krasimir. And now you are saying that
Engin Terzi: uh 50 50 so you are also giving good chance to daniel even though he was 75 but probably on the competition he was 78 he will be 82 so it's good that you think you think it's gonna be a good hook for i'm sure it will be and you don't see any dominance uh option by samusha no i don't think so
Krasimir Kostadinov: oh okay so then we are gonna watch another good match then i i just want to say that what uh john said about the endurance i'm totally agree with you uh john it really is like that for me because sometimes you're stronger but you cannot finish you just need to hold a little bit more and then you finish but the endurance is when you are about equal and
Engin Terzi: then it comes yeah and then you then you equal for five rounds but sometimes you don't know that sometimes because maybe not because you cannot finish but you wait and then the guy is getting out of gas and then you beat him we don't know that yeah but exactly but that makes you stronger i mean that's called endurance that you get you know you don't get tired while the guy is getting tired you need to balance the match
Engin Terzi: And you need to tire the opponent. If the guy is guessing out quicker than you, it endures his power as well. Endurance is power that you can continue longer. Yeah, yeah, but that may be just the means that your opponent have no endurance. It doesn't mean that... If the match is not going anywhere, it means it's a close match. And if the guy is guessing out and you are not guessing out, you have more endurance. That's what it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ivan Matyushenko: Anyways, Ivan, do you know them? Daniel and Samushia? Yes, I saw Prokopchuk at the World Championships. I saw Samushia also at the last event. I think it's a good match and perhaps it has the potential to be the longest one. Well, I don't know who will win, but perhaps I would bet on Prokopchuk. Perhaps.
Engin Terzi: wow wow actually if i have to bet to someone i would also bet from daniel the reason is that uh samusha is around 90 kilo and he's coming down to 85 barely and then he will go up again competition night while daniel just made the weight 75 maybe he was 78 kilo after the competition and he's coming up to 82
Engin Terzi: So that is why I think that one is coming down, one is going up. And then I thought that he was a little bigger, you understand? And probably more chance, you know, I was thinking. But I like to hear your opinions and this is interesting for me. I like it. I haven't seen anyone to beat Daniel in hook at that weight. I mean, did he pull a lot of matches in that weight? I don't know.
Engin Terzi: But in 70 kilo, yes. But in the heavyweight, I think this is his first unit, and the European second. And Artem, how do you see that?
John Brzenk: I'm not sure about the weight, how it's going to play out, but I want to go with Davit because he's a bigger guy here. But yeah, I see it can go either way. I'm not too confident, but I'm just going to go with Davit because of the size difference. But yeah, it's going in the hook. And then Wagner Bortolato versus Di Dzeranov?
Krasimir Kostadinov: That's left-handed, right? Yeah, that sounds super interesting to me. And I would say, I don't know. Actually, I cannot say who is going to win this one. It's very close in my eyes. If Wagner goes shoulder behind, he wins. And if Dzeranov takes his wrist, it can be close. How do you see it? How do you see the match going?
Krasimir Kostadinov: i i think that i have i haven't seen somebody top rolling portolato with left arm what devon did hermes did actually yeah hermes did but yeah hermes did it but when devon did it wagner was already tired i think it was something like mid semi hook so
Engin Terzi: i believe wagner is really good against top rowers with left okay so you are you don't have prediction but you think that the match is gonna go inside yeah i think i think it will be something like semi-hook semi-hook and who is going to win i don't know and e1 e1 is the one that you know has probably the most experience with both guys uh sorry what did you say
Ivan Matyushenko: I think you are the one who has the most experience. Yes, I pulled Bertolotto's right hand, not left. I think his left is much better, yes. Well, as far as... Well, I think that Bertolotto is a little favorite. He is bigger and perhaps...
Engin Terzi: Well, I think that Bertolotto can win, but it will be an even match. Awesome. And do you guys know his weight? Do you guys know the weights? Wagner is 151 kilo and Dzeranov is 123 kilo. Yeah. Does it change opinion? Me? No.
John Brzenk: might not okay okay and artem uh i i it's either i don't understand arm wrestling but i'm going with georgie uh as a clear favorite oh georgie clears favors okay yeah yeah i don't i don't i don't see wagner no and i have a question for you one do you think you want uh does i don't know his better left or better right
Ivan Matyushenko: I think his right is better. His hook on his right is better. With left more top roll? His hook on left is worse than on his right. Well, and I do not know anything about his top roll because I didn't feel it much, actually, both on left and right. Well, he beat me in the hook, unfortunately, for me.
Ivan Matyushenko: Okay, he won right and left, right? In 2019. Yes, but he won on left with fouls. And I think that we were equal on left hand. Oh, in the hook position? Yes, we were rather equal. But I felt that I could win. But on right hand, I thought I couldn't win. Well, Wagner has triceps also.
Ivan Matyushenko: So I think that in a hook war, it may be an advantage somehow. The question for you, you said right arm you couldn't beat Dzeranov, but didn't you pull Alexander Getalo before you pulled... Yes, at the finals I could do nothing at all because I was tired. But we met fresh at the beginning and then he won.
Engin Terzi: rather confidently yeah yeah and uh okay yeah anyway so i'm gonna make make that table you know with extra screws just for wagner and i'm serious you know just because i mean we don't want to during the live show we don't want a broken table you know i mean yeah in the walk you can wait like 15 20 minutes break you know but here it shouldn't happen and the guy really shakes the table you know
Krasimir Kostadinov: uh anyway so and okay so let's go let's go let's go more pauline versus uh iraqi in my eyes paulin is the favorite here but i we haven't seen iraqi for for a long time so i don't know how good he is now i understand so you are saying
Engin Terzi: he says that he's in he's he's in the best shape maybe maybe i don't know okay okay so you are saying the poland is gonna win i think he's the favorite okay and how do you see that he's gonna hook him and beat him yeah i think it will finish inside yeah and then you want um
Ivan Matyushenko: Perhaps I saw only one match with Paul Lim. Well, it's difficult for me to predict. Which match did you see? With someone I don't know, perhaps. Okay, but did you not see his match with Samushia in the East vs West? Yes, also I saw it, yes. How about his match with John Bersink, you didn't see?
Ivan Matyushenko: They had a hook match. It was perhaps, it was long ago. It was a year ago. One year ago. A year ago. Maybe, yes. Maybe, yes, I saw. But Brzenk won easily, yes? No. Quite easily. No? No. Only one round with top row, he won easily. Paul also tried at the beginning, and then Jones wrist went a little bit back, and then he survived. And then Paul wanted to go inside. It was too late.
Ivan Matyushenko: And then second and third rounds, Paul hooked John. He's rather versatile. And he tried many techniques in that match. Yeah, he hooked John. Now I remember. Now I remember, yes. John's pronator got injured. He was getting so red. So perhaps he's rather strong then. Yes. Another thing I will give you. If John was good at that time.
Engin Terzi: if he was good perhaps he was just starting his um his comeback yeah he was not in his top shape yeah but also six months ago only in also with rambats you saw them well so 50 50. so you normally you were gonna say gamtenadze and now 50 50 eternal after i manage okay
Ivan Matyushenko: I understand, yeah. But people say that... Well, actually, if he is a good top roller, perhaps he is the favorite then, because as far as I know, lrakli had some problems with wrist. Well, long ago. Well, I haven't seen him for long. I understand. You know, if he gets in hook, he has very weird style, you know, that way. He can make somebody's day, you know, like become a nightmare, you know. Yeah. And Artem, do you know them?
John Brzenk: i'm not too familiar with iraqli to be honest i've seen some match at wf and it looked some wild stuff and i was thinking here's the guy but i don't know i go to his crash and say pauline is the guy okay okay so yeah i'm not too familiar with directly like his actual weight class okay and and cobra versus hyder both are you know retired and just making comeback with two months training they are competing
Ivan Matyushenko: I see Cobra. Cobra. Okay. And Ivan? This is legend category. Unfortunately, I haven't seen Haydar Poland. Well, but I know Cobra and I saw quite a lot of videos with him. Well, I don't know Haydar, unfortunately. Yeah. And his shape now.
Ivan Matyushenko: but uh cobra uh was the puller who beat my first coach alex mundusvili in 1998 yes so i remember him from that time from 1999 yeah 1999 he came to waffles
Engin Terzi: Vladi Kavkaz, and then he beat Pozzino, he beat Alex Mundishvili, he beat Shamil Karajev. Many people don't know about these guys. I wish they knew. I wish they knew. He was very good then. Yeah, yeah. Later, perhaps not, right? Maybe he made a pause. Did he?
Engin Terzi: mean yeah i mean it is not about the pulse but you know you get damage you get you know things i don't know what happens but but it was the beginning of fuzz you know i think two years later but you know became something else yeah even even next year but you know was very good yeah i saw him he toppled fuzz you know uh even you don't see fuzz you know being toppled even even what's that say uh the only person could approach fordino
Engin Terzi: Yeah, maybe. Taras couldn't top roll him. When Taras beat him in 2002 Europeans, he beat him with a drag hook, you know, opening his bicep. But first match when he tried to fully top roll, Fasino hook him and beat him. I don't remember anyone with eyes. I never seen Fasino being top roll, except Cobra top roll him. But when Cobra top roll him, Fasino was very young. I don't know, maybe 18, maybe 19. I don't know. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, and Artem, you don't know Haydar probably. Yeah, same thing. I'm going with Cobra. Yeah, I understand, yeah. And then, so we go a little bit coming to the matches that Krasimir likes. Matt Mask and Sandris. From what I felt from Matt, I will go 100% with Matt. If...
Krasimir Kostadinov: If Sandris beats him, then it will surprise me so much. I don't know how good I was against Matt because I had very short notice to pull him. But he beat me so easy that I felt like nothing that match. So I will go with Matt. Did you feel him stronger than lrakli?
Krasimir Kostadinov: yes yes yeah this is how it looked yeah yes it was like that because with matt the referees put the strap really tight and even like with tight strap i couldn't do anything so yeah i'm telling you after how prudnik behave with him you know play with him
Engin Terzi: he made it a matter of honor for himself and then he went back and he's probably now in his best shape in his ever you know in my opinion i don't know when i saw his forearm one week ago yeah it looked scary yeah yeah and and how do you see that match he won i think that too much is the favorite um
Ivan Matyushenko: Also, Sandris had a VARF championship not long ago. So perhaps his peak was there. And also, Matt perhaps has become stronger than he was. Well, I would bet on Matt Mask. Yeah, but don't you think that Sandris also became very strong? Him hooking Getalo and beating Getalo in hook. Not many people can do that.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yes, that was good. That was impressive, right. But I'm not sure that he will manage to, how to say, to get ready for this match after that championship. Well, it's a big difference for me, I think, to get ready, especially from Alphite, and to get ready with such a good championship in between on the one hand. But also, also,
Ivan Matyushenko: Perhaps Sandris has some problems with wrist. Perhaps. And Matt will top-roll him, I think. But who knows? When you say that he has problems, you don't talk about injury, right? You say that weakness you are talking about. Well, I saw some matches where he lost his wrist. So that's why I think that he has some problems in that field.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yeah, did you see that match after his Getalo match or before he lost his wrist? Because his Getalo match was tough. Well, I think I talk about previous matches, previous years. In the past, yeah. But perhaps he has become much better, yes. Who knows? But I would bet still on match now. But I think that Sandris has big potential.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah yeah um but you said that because of waff but do you realize that daniel also pull off and samusha didn't um yes yeah so he has the same situation but you favored uh daniel as far as i remember right yeah
Engin Terzi: i don't know actually yes yeah yeah that that could be a problem if there is a problem it could be a problem for daniel as well maybe i don't know i don't know i'm just trying to remind you that maybe you would you would have different opinion just to remind you that daniel also pulls you up and artem how do you see that i say matt mask is the favorite in this one or at least so i think he's gonna win do you guys think that if matt takes his wrist sunday still have chance like this
Engin Terzi: We remember that, you know, Matt Mask top rolled Tatashins, but Tatashins was able to beat him. But same Matt Mask top roll, Marcio couldn't resist with the dead wrist. So not everyone can do as Tatashins too. Yeah, exactly. What's that? There are not many people who can pull like Hutchins like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: i agree but at the waft at the waft sundries put some matches like that as well he's strong but let's see let's see how how it would be i i have no idea but those are english okay let's go to the match of god john bersing and petrenko for me it's super evil match i cannot bet on this match power and coordination and experience and knowledge
Engin Terzi: i see both of them with super solid wrists and very solid back pressure so i really don't know what to expect um petrenko said that his his weights that he lived is 30 percent more than his 2019 uh zloty to shape but there he was 95. yeah he will be yeah
Engin Terzi: I mean it's it's interesting match you know normally beating john is not only power you know like on gotta be john because his his technique is able to talk for arm his top role quality like I mean incredible petrenko doesn't have the same tool but perhaps horsepower petrenko maybe even maybe even stronger but once john
Engin Terzi: is able to use what he has he can do incredible things and i think petrenko is one of those guys that john will not have so difficult time to apply what he has so that makes the things difficult for petrenko but petrenko's power may be also difficult for john so that's why you are probably thinking 50 50 or yes exactly yeah and anyone
Ivan Matyushenko: I also think that it is an even match. They have rather close technique. I think that whose side pressure is stronger, that person will win. I do not think that John will be able to top-roll Petrenko as well as Petrenko top-roll John. So side who has better side, that person would win.
Engin Terzi: my mind you are saying that they will go back and they will stay with the flat wrist and then they will be yes i think that it will be something like that yes and what if they end up hook oh sorry what if they end up in hook what happens there in hook well also very close very close and i would bet i would bet on john
Ivan Matyushenko: Yes, I think that he was not in good shape with Angarbaev. I think that if he prepared better, he would have won. I think, but that's my opinion. Yeah, yeah, of course, we respect your opinion. I think he looked different from how he looked at the previous event. Yeah, and Krasimir, it's the same question for you.
John Brzenk: what if somehow end up in hook i would say it's still very even i don't know what to say okay okay okay so that's a good match yeah and our time yeah i agree i'm not really sure who is gonna win that because it's pretty equal i'm just gonna say i'm gonna go with john just because it's hard not to bet uh you know i guess john so
Engin Terzi: I don't want to miss any match, but let's continue. Revaz Lutidze vs. Artem Morozov. I believe if they go top row vs. top row, Revaz is going to win.
Engin Terzi: but i believe that if uh john goes in in hook he will be able to to beat us i agree i agree but the question which option do you see more possible i see first if artem tries to hook and then revas tries to stop from the first round if uh john goes in hook
Krasimir Kostadinov: i believe he will win the the match all the rounds but if but if the first round of john tries top row and loses his wrist then after that i don't know if he let that if he let that match to go he shouldn't start with that because once his wrist goes like this
Engin Terzi: later on he may still continue going that way i mean even if he loses the wrist but let's let the match go after it he may hook him but if he tries to hold with that wrist then it's not nice okay i understand so you are saying that because you saw him who can even dave cheffy and then so you are thinking that if he did that to cheffy he can also do to revas yes yes and and you want
Ivan Matyushenko: Well, I think the same, that Rivas is very good at top role. But I think that Artem will not be able to hook Rivas. Well, I think that Rivas is the favorite here.
Engin Terzi: okay so you are saying that you are thinking the same when they go both top row versus top row you think like crossing me but additionally you are thinking that it will not be easy to hook that was either i think only if um maybe artem um
Ivan Matyushenko: Well, I think that it was a win. Well, that Artyom will have little chances, yes. Wow, that's interesting. And Artyom?
John Brzenk: um i think rivas is the favorite during two also like the size like the guy is just so much bigger but and as the guy says topples the topple situation uh however i'm just artem's fan so i'm gonna go with that but yeah it's it's an interesting one because the way it's gonna go and the most important
Krasimir Kostadinov: Artyom, did you just say Artem? What was that? And again, most of the people, the English guys, they don't know that Artem is Artyom.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Every time when somebody say Artem, it's not correct. The correct one is to say Artem. Yeah, Artem, yeah. But now I'm so used to that, I just say it like that too, so. Most important question, Krasimir. Do you agree that Toprol is for smart people?
Engin Terzi: let's leave this topic you know you want you know you know that right krasimir says that hook is for real men and and then they they ask the same question to hermes casparini he says top role is only for smart people and there's a joke like this you know nothing serious yeah i know i also i know this joke well i think actually that it's rather difficult to hook and it's also
Ivan Matyushenko: You have to be somehow smart to enforce this technique. Not everyone can hook. And also if we talk about novices, those who start armwrestling, I think it's easier to teach them top roll than to hook.
Krasimir Kostadinov: yeah the beginner the beginner to hook somebody he should be really genetically very strong it's not possible to teach some weak guys to hook they should be very strong when they come to the gym i i don't know i don't know when whenever you grow up when you say show your power everyone spinates and do this i i don't see people doing this except arm masters so it is more natural move this
Engin Terzi: than training pronators. I mean, I don't think that anybody's pronated outside on state is any developed, but I mean, I don't know. A lot of people did a lot of bicep. I don't know. Maybe it can go both ways, yeah. Well, it's not about biceps, I think, right? Hook is not biceps. It's more like arm pronation. Yes, and this move and supination. No, what I'm just saying, the hook is more about supination and topple is more about pronation.
Krasimir Kostadinov: but uh we don't agree because we both me and divan when we hook we don't supinate we go here we use the pronator all the time well not at the beginning trust me i i can show you guys a lot of matches you are on your bicep like this yeah but the thing is that even your pronated later trust me
Engin Terzi: yeah it's true it's true that i started to develop my printer later but uh every time when i'm even like this i always try to hold it yeah yeah then later later years you also become smarter i'm just joking but but i remember i was talking with ivan about pronator
Ivan Matyushenko: He said that he doesn't pronate. He stops the guy with fully bottom of his hand. He said, do you remember that I was telling you? And you said that you were not using any pronators. Ivan? Well, I would call it not pronation. I'm from pronation. I would call it, how to say? The thump. This move is chopping, right? Yeah, yeah. In code risk position.
Engin Terzi: I would call it like chopping in encode risk position, right? Yeah, but I'm just saying that when you start like this, any moment that you are like, I mean, to block your opponent's pronator, totally isolate, you really need to isolate here. You know, like you need to, like, I don't think that you guys do like this. I mean, I see like you go hook, but you still use pronator, but you first a little bit spin it and then
Engin Terzi: maybe i don't think that you guys are like this you too cross me i i'm trying to hold my thumb and my pronator active all the time yeah yeah but but after the start of the match your arm is more turning to bicep than turning out i can show you right now your your mesh with uh what's the guy's name the ukrainian that you pull and um yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah you know not the pasta the other one the first one uh with the margarine margarine yeah it was just like you know yeah but i was holding my pronator all the time i understand but your pronator is working from here till here your pronator is working you are using your pronator even in your bicep but your arm to come the position first is spinated
Engin Terzi: yeah but when the guy is putting pressure then your pronator is reacting but but my arm goes there yeah because he's cupping me not because i'm going here it goes there because he's very strong with cupping that's why you don't want to go there but you go there so that is where i'm talking that only
Krasimir Kostadinov: Yeah, but it's true that especially when the second match when Peto beat me, I didn't want to go like this. I wanted to stay like this, but just his cupping is so strong and he was able to overcome my pronator. I understand. And Artem, how do you see the match? I don't even know which match we are talking about. Revaz versus Morozov, was it? No.
Krasimir Kostadinov: i i think we finished with that match oh john john bersing john bersing and patrenko no no it was it was just because i said that uh artyom said uh them and i think i think we're done talking about it we're going to another one okay so morozov versus gasparini left arm and people think that gasparini doesn't have super strong left arm uh maybe his horsepower is not that
Engin Terzi: good as he's right but i think his top role ability is not bad but your opinion uh i would go with uh i see morozov as the favorite with left arm how do you see the match technically i believe for tom will be able to top awareness i understand and ivan well i don't know actually
Ivan Matyushenko: uh i think that um well i would better perhaps on gasparini but i'm not i'm not sure i think the top against top row maybe gasparini is a little better maybe and of course uh artem is a stronger hook if he gets there and perhaps he he will be able to get there um i will give you some info um
Engin Terzi: He won. Artem is a little bit injured inside over here. If you remember his match against Dadikyan in Dubai, if you realize that he avoid going there, he only went out totally and he waited, waited. He didn't even try once. And I know that he's hurt here. He cannot go inside. So just if you are going to do prediction,
Ivan Matyushenko: do it with this information as far as i know i think that match hundred percent he will be approvers my opinion if he didn't heal up super good maybe he's healed up now i don't know okay you'd say yeah well the leverage uh artyom has a bigger level yes but perhaps his wrist is not too strong for gasparino so i would uh i think that um gasparino would win
Krasimir Kostadinov: Perhaps. Okay. Krasimir is saying that Artem Morozov is winning. Yeah. For me, it's a close match, but I would say 42-60 in favor of Artyom. Krasimir, you and I, we have very different close understanding of 60-40. Mine is like, if it's close, it's like 52-48. Yeah. For me, 60-40 is still a very close match. Okay. And Artem?
John Brzenk: I don't know, listening to you guys, I'm kind of, I don't know, I'm lost. I do believe that even this Artem's injury, he still has more tools. But yeah, I see the point of Ermias just having too much top roll, especially if it goes top roll to top roll.
John Brzenk: oh um i don't know i don't know it's close it's close i'm gonna go i'm gonna go with artem uh you know whatever three two this is artem i'm sorry i'm trying i'm trying it's in my head i need a good one day of russian speaking for to refresh it okay now we are getting more sensitive
Krasimir Kostadinov: Dave Chaffee versus Ermes Gasparini? I don't know. I would say I would give a slight edge to Dave, but very slight edge. It's time now 64, right? This is like 51, 49 maybe? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, that's good, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how do you see technically?
Krasimir Kostadinov: Like what are the possibilities that the match can go? How do you like close your eyes and how do you imagine the match? Ready, go. I can see Ermes taking Dave's wrist and Dave from here attack to the side and Ermes losing this. This is what I see. Dave losing the hand but going to the side and Ermes losing the center.
Engin Terzi: you are saying that dave to go sideways this way he will protect his pronator even his wrist is like this so it means that arab is not going to lose his wrist but he will not have total cup either because if total cup i don't think so so you are saying this will be a little bit like flat and maybe slightly bent but doesn't have the full control yes exactly
Engin Terzi: and then they will go but he will still have tornado too yeah that is whatever you see is exactly whatever i see but ernest says that he is not going to lose the center right from the beginning and and how do you see the match if it goes to round one going like that and then who is getting exhausted later i i don't know you don't know right yeah yeah yeah yeah and then many people many people they go like
Engin Terzi: I bet this one. And then whenever they win, they bet, I mean, or predict correct, they say, hey, you know, Engin didn't know, Krasimir didn't know, but I know. I mean, if you go outside to ask anybody on the street, you say, do you know our medicine? No. I will tell you two names. Who is winning?
Engin Terzi: Dave or Ermes, 50% chance. So it is not about knowing who's going to win, but this is more about more, you know, about arm wrestling, more, you know, about the possibilities. But to say the last word that this guy is going to win, it is, we don't know. I mean, you need to have a very sensitive, like, scale to do that. And you don't know their current power, you know. There are so many factors. Yes, yes, so many. And more, you know, more you are,
Ivan Matyushenko: confused, you don't know. Exactly, exactly. And Ivan, how do you see this match? Well, as far as I know, Dave took it on short notice, right? And he had not long ago a war with Laletin, so I think he also is not 100%, perhaps 90%.
Ivan Matyushenko: And also, I think that Ermes is very good. His side pressure also is very good. Well, from what I saw against Gennady Kikvinya, he had very good side pressure as well. Well, I think that in this match, Ermes is the favorite. A few things. I want to just, I respect 100%, but that was Gennady's first coming back match.
Engin Terzi: after 2018 or 19 or something, 18 probably. So it was the first match that he was coming, he was making a comeback. Do you think that the Gennady that we saw now and Gennady that a year ago, his first match, are the same Gennady? Because he is also recovering from injury. And the second of all, side pressure, yes, Ermes is good. But round one, Dave Chaffee, whenever Gennady tried to top roll, Dave, and he wasn't,
Engin Terzi: Gennady did it with more, six, seven months more training after his comeback. And round one, when Gennady tried top roll, Dave just went through to the pad and Ermes top roll, it kind of took maybe 10, 11 hits and then with shoulder pressure to finish. Do you think that Ermes has better side pressure, stronger side pressure than Dave? Or because you think that his hand and top roll ability will gain him a position
Ivan Matyushenko: which is more advantageous than Dave, and then he will... Well, I think that 100% Dave would be the favorite, but I think that he will not be 100%. I'm not sure. I think he will be 90%, and that will be enough for Ermes to win. I think he will take his risk, and also he has enough side pressure to finish the match. Okay, okay.
Engin Terzi: And so you are saying that if there was 100%, he would win, but your opinion and guess prediction is that he is not 100%. So do you think that 50 days, 50 days, almost two months? Well, maybe I'm judging like if I had such a war, 50 days, I would never pick again in 50 days. I would pick perhaps in 100 days.
Engin Terzi: oh three months you need yeah so it is it is it is uh after such a war yes and they've had too many wars uh lately yeah i understand i understand i understand yeah yeah you're right yeah let's see let's see how it will be so you are betting on hermes and uh crossing me to saying very slightly very tiny tiny tiny goes today and then
John Brzenk: Artem is going to say probably Dave. I'm going to go with Dave. Yeah, I'm going to go with Dave. Because you are in the US, you need to support Team West. Well, I also, I don't know, Dave looked impressive. I agree with Ivan's idea that Dave also had that war with Vitaly. And technically, yeah, I don't know how you can recover from that and compete at the same, that picked out level.
John Brzenk: So I think it's a challenge for Dave, but I'm going with Dave for that one. Also, we do have five pounds super chat. Engin, you're the man. I'm so hyped for the East versus West. Oh, thank you. That was classy finger. Thank you very much. Yeah. And we're going to go to the last match and we are going to finish. But can we consider, I know it was so destroying, but can we consider Dave's match?
Engin Terzi: is a very very very good training or not i mean if you are not injured i don't see why i mean if he if he comes back stronger and not injured yes it's a great training session
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah because i i don't think it's great training session it's it's it's always uh some injuries after such or always he said he recovered so what i'm just saying that it is good for endurance i think that's also some memory comes to your endurance and i i think that he helped his uh confidence that if he has such a position now he knows that you know yeah yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: yeah there is something that he can do you know you can train on the training this but he he did this against someone like laletin and it works you know so that is that's interesting but let's see how it will be what i see what i see it is all up to the wrist all up to the wrist the match has nothing to do with anything else if dave goes and if i don't think they can control hermes's tornado i don't think no way but if
Engin Terzi: if Ermes controls Dave's pronator, he's going to stop control and win that match. If Dave can keep Ermes' wrist flat, and if they go stay like flat versus flat, and I don't think that Ermes can stop him because Dave is more used to, you know, pulling that way with the side pressure, while Ermes is someone that always depends on taking everything. So if the match goes flat wrist versus flat wrist,
Engin Terzi: I don't think that, you know, Ermes has the same experience all day with that kind of pulling. That is all about the risk position. My opinion, but we will see. And then we go to the last match. Devon Larratt versus Evgeny Prudnik. And from here, the question is, if this will be enough to open Evgeny's wrist,
Engin Terzi: If Evgeny's wrist is not solid enough, we'll have to stop him like this. We'll tire him up and we'll beat him. Okay, let's start from the beginning. Will the match go to strap? Yes, yes. Okay, so you are saying that Devon will manage to slip. Okay. Because I saw Tatachins manage to go to strap.
Engin Terzi: know with that and i think devon can do the same thing but nick is not the that guy who is holding uh without the straps he just let the match go into those traps yeah but he did he did when when when uh arthur morozov tried to top roll him round one he just hook him and then comfortably beat him and i think that he didn't allow to go to tatashins to round one also he just went quick
Engin Terzi: maybe he he wanted to go to serve because i don't know what is very tricky like here he's yeah like this like this he's like this so i'm sure the match will go to the steps yeah but larat is also so much used to starting the match with strap as well yeah
Engin Terzi: But if they ever need it in a strap, Devon will take it to the shop, I think. In East vs West rules, no matter where you sleep, it is a strap, as long as it is not a parallel pin or something. And as long as your elbow on the pad, there is nothing like intentional slip or something. We decided this long before this match was even brought to subject because we wanted the matches to happen with pins, you know. Yes. Yeah, so I understand.
Krasimir Kostadinov: And then you are saying that the match is going to stop in strap or not? I don't know. I say that we will see this for a while. And the question is if Evgeny's wrist is solid enough to finish the match. Which position do you think he should attack? Here? Here? Or here? I don't think that there is such a big difference actually.
Engin Terzi: i believe in almost all the directions about the same this is my opinion okay and this the shoulder rule this is okay anything that humerus is down angle is a direct foul so will it affect the result of the match um
Engin Terzi: when you say like this i realized the devil will be allowed to pull like this and i don't but but two years three years i have been saying that you know even you go videos before the east versus west from two years ago i say anything this is the waffle as well you know the humerus bone is parallel is okay it is down angle is foul this is okay
Engin Terzi: When you say like he is allowed, there is no organization on this earth that would call this foul. Justin show me one organization that with the humorous one parallel is calling a foul. I don't think so. There is no organization. But once it goes like this, the only difference one would call it get up, get up, get up. But our rules right from the beginning is a direct foul for it. So still, I don't know if
Krasimir Kostadinov: if he gains his wrist will be solid enough i cannot say so you are saying that devil is the favorite it's 50 50 in my eyes oh 50 50 okay so okay actually slight edge to brutnik i i would say so 50.5 and 49.5 no i i would say 55 to 45.
Engin Terzi: oh so it is not as close as the the previous match which one was it 51 49 ermes versus dave oh okay okay okay so you are saying that brudnick is morphing against devon then dave is against ermes yes this is how i think okay and let's go to ivan matushenko our legendary russian puller let's go
Ivan Matyushenko: thank you i'm not a legendary yet as you said i have i have to win your 115 class to become legendary right no no you are already legendary not yet you said not yet the last time i have a little to achieve even in my eyes you are legendary in your hooking ability
Ivan Matyushenko: Oh, yeah. There are just a few guys in the world that can hook like you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's true. That's true. But Ivan said that my pronator is strong. Right, Ivan? Well, I think that Prudnik is a favorite here. And the only thing that can stop him is that...
Ivan Matyushenko: uh devon's uh first move uh which he used against present against uh hutchins against dave uh with that open arm position well and it depends on the rules um would there be a foul or not and i think that in the first if in the first round he manages to hit uh even a little uh then devon has chances to
Ivan Matyushenko: to win all other matches uh yes exactly yes but uh if um there will be a strict rules and uh um he will not be allowed to do that uh i would say not good thing as he did against uh brzenk no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Engin Terzi: uh against your shoulder forget about being parallel it was even a little bit over it was open like this well but it looked um rather ugly i would say anyway oh no i ugly is different thing to me this is ugly too i i hate it but what to do you know as long as the shoulder doesn't well the arm was open right the shoulder open arm top roll this is this is called
Ivan Matyushenko: I'm not sure that it is a fair move. Well, anyway, I think that much depends on this move. If he is able to perform it, then Prudnik's wrist will be maybe a little destroyed and all other matches Devon would win. But if not, I think that Prudnik is a little favorite.
Engin Terzi: because also devon has to lose weight to 115. he told me whenever i talked with him about setting this match he said he was 261 pounds which is about 180 and a half kilo or something devon said but later i saw another video he said he was 263 or something which is about four kilo or something four and a half kilo but the way in
Engin Terzi: the friday morning and the competition is saturday uh night this has been like this right from the beginning you know from the first east versus west one you know and so there is one and a half day exactly for the um uh competition between wayne and competition so you are saying that prudnik is favorite in your eyes but you are saying that you are also telling us the possibilities if even if once
Engin Terzi: Devon wins, stops him, stops him, and then the match is over, you are saying? I think yes. In any round, right? Perhaps, yes. So, Prudnik is winning 2-0, and then third round, boom, he stopped him. So, you are saying that the match will be over, or you think that match will be over if Prudnik burns himself, maybe he just lays down.
Engin Terzi: then tries for the next start or something well i think that in this game uh devon is better he's obviously better so you are saying that if prudnik wants to win there needs to be three flash pins or yes okay what what if the match stops but with prudnik is advantageous position and that one is like this and prudnik doesn't lose the race but
Ivan Matyushenko: I think that it will not happen because Prudnik has too good a side pressure in this case. So he will be pinned to the end. So you are saying that as long as Prudnik doesn't lose his wrist, he will be pinned? But if he loses, then it would be very difficult for him. Do you think there is any chance that he goes like this, this close, and then he goes and then finishes?
Ivan Matyushenko: maybe maybe i haven't seen any pulling like this uh lately uh last years but uh in the previous years maybe 10 years ago uh he used such technique perhaps perhaps i saw it yeah so yes he is also able to perform well no disrespect for joven yes but um but that um open arm arm wrestling
Ivan Matyushenko: It doesn't look good, actually. No, I agree with you. I agree. I agree. And especially when two people like this with open arms pull, it is even worse. Well, I remember his match against Dave. Dave also started something like that. But they both did that. It doesn't look like arm wrestling, I think. No, no, I agree. But then the Humerus was down angle.
Engin Terzi: It wasn't like this, but it was more like this. So whenever I am telling you, if the humerus is down angle, I will talk with referees. It's a direct foul. Everyone knows the east versus west rules. But if the shoulder is not down angle, the humerus, there is no reason to stop the match. And this is the rule. I can go against. Evgeny in the WAF, this is the same rule.
Engin Terzi: even WAF shows more toleration to it they say up up up up they go up okay it's okay you understand here because once you go you put extra pressure you take the openness wrist so it's an advantage you gain advantage so here is a foul but if it doesn't go below table of course i mean we are not going to call it what about um
Engin Terzi: What about fouls? Will there be strict elbow fouls this time? No, no, no. After Jerry versus Gennady match, we decided two months ago to make the elbow pads not 18-18, but 20-20, but from one something more from front, one something from back, one something from this side, and one something from this side.
Engin Terzi: But now, any getting out is a foul. But for the elbow on the pad, on the borders of the pad, if it is like you hit and it jumps like this, it's not a foul. But whenever you gain advantage, it's a foul. But those tiny jumps, sometimes you hit, little bit movement, and the match stops. I'm telling you something.
Engin Terzi: If you call all of them, those tiny ones like this, nobody is going to watch professional armistice. Nobody's going to pay money. The match will start foul, foul, foul, foul, winner. And then people say, oh, bullshit. I'm not going to watch this anymore. So we need to go with the, as long as no advantage gain, it's okay. If they, you know, you know, we know, you know, what is exactly what gains the advantage. And then whenever you hit the hits, you know, it just little bit jumps.
Ivan Matyushenko: are not going to call those ones but it's the same right from the beginning oh no it is difficult to decide so sometimes uh uh if it uh gave advantage or it didn't right so it's uh it's up to the reference and it makes it difficult for reference true um but but if it is hard to decide it means that both decisions are acceptable
Engin Terzi: You know, if it is hard, like, should I or not, even if you call or you don't call, it's still okay. It means that it is in the border, you understand? Nobody will say, but if it's, when you know that, but you know when you shouldn't call and you know when you for sure should call. And if something in between happens, then both decisions are acceptable. We need to trust the honesty or the integrity or the referees, you know, I mean, you understand that there's not much you can do about us.
Engin Terzi: But if it be too strict, trust me, the professional armwrestling will go down. Trust me. That is why when you do the WAF World Finals, that's why 1,500 people watch us. And then these events, even with paying money, a lot of people watch us.
Engin Terzi: So if this event was like online free, I'm telling you, minimum 100, 150,000 people would watch it live at the moment. So you need to really think of the fans as well. So that is why we are a little bit flexible. And Artem, let's go.
John Brzenk: uh i like i mean i would like to say after listening to a little the the match stops i think devon got it but can he stop it who knows if evgeny's traditional style of arm wrestling will be enough to just wax seven three four zero whatever it takes so
John Brzenk: don't know i mean i want to go with devon because devon was preparing for levon earlier and evgenia wasn't so i think devon devon has to prove us that he's like you know that he got it so i'm going to devon okay and sean krauter thank you for your super chat engine is the increased elbows fat size for all weight categories or just super weight it is for all the weight categories my friend for everyone
Engin Terzi: every category so that's what it is and the last last questions and then we are finishing let me start with ivan this time you want um who are your top five in the world right now and the second question in your opinion i know one is from your country and the other one is not but whenever i ask this question to arsen who is also from russia
Engin Terzi: his opinion and he always talks very highly about dennis he said that one time he was super prepared he went lotoshin or a1 or something he said he'd eat him like he never hit anyone and he was in his best ever shape and he said that he hit a wall and then dennis beat him in one second he said next day
Engin Terzi: His arm was just all hurting, sore and everything. But he thought that nobody in the history that could beat Levano today. So what is your opinion about this subject? And after that, tell us your top five, please.
Ivan Matyushenko: Sorry, I didn't hear all of you said. You said that Arsen thinks that Levan is the best ever and Denis was the best ever before Levan. He's saying that Denis was incredibly strong. He couldn't even move, even in his best shape. But he thinks that because of the style and everything of Levan, he thinks that Levan
Ivan Matyushenko: was the strongest that ever lived and i'm asking your opinion about it well actually i do not think so because dennis has also had also and perhaps has something like devon's open arm top roll but his open arm is smaller
Ivan Matyushenko: And in that position it is very difficult, it was very difficult to pin him. Almost impossible, I would say, in straps especially. And I think that top Dennis, using this technique, he would stop Levan. Levan's top roll. Yes, he would, that open arm position. Well, actually, Dennis' arm doesn't straighten.
Ivan Matyushenko: I think on the start, Levan could win without straps. That's for sure. But in straps, I do not think so. Well, now Denis is not that good. But in previous years, I think he would give a good fight to Levan and perhaps even win.
Engin Terzi: okay so you are saying that if levan can manage to stay without the step he would be there yes the match you are saying the brochure would stop somewhere here and then the match could go either way and perhaps dennis could even win yeah okay and yes i think that dennis even would properly one uh from that position i think i understand yeah so i will ask your top five a little bit later and cross him what do you think about that subject
Krasimir Kostadinov: if levan is the strongest i i was i'm just curious to see dave chaffee versus levan actually in straps it's so pity for the arm wrestling world that in their match we didn't see them pulling in the straps do you know i will give you some news whenever whenever i had a i had a chat with levan
Engin Terzi: I said, Levan, do you remember you had, you accepted the rules when you pull against Devon in Dubai and the match, if they didn't get grip in 30 seconds, it goes directly to Strep. He said, yes. And I said, if they come with the offer with the same rules against Dave Chappie, would you accept? He said, yes, for sure. And then I told this to Dave and Dave was very happy. And he was like, if I beat Ermes, he said, you know, let's go.
Engin Terzi: know so that that if they wins the match is gonna happen and most likely because i have it on the youtube both said okay let's go so whatever that happens you know yeah that's that sounds nice that sounds nice to me because in my eyes
Krasimir Kostadinov: Dave Chaffee had the strongest arm in the arm wrestling world for maybe 10 years. In my eyes, he was stronger than Denis. When Denis beat him, he was using that open arm top row because his arm is not going straight. So in my eyes, Dave Chaffee was the stronger guy. Yeah, but didn't Denis also beat him in hook in the last A1 or something? He went to hook?
Krasimir Kostadinov: Firstly, he tired him up like this and then beat him in hook. Oh, okay. But the first match, he stopped him like this. Okay, okay. I understand. So, in my eyes, Dave Chaffee was stronger than Denis. And that's why the question in my head is Dave Chaffee or Levan. Yeah, but beating Dave, you said that Dave's arm was stronger, but Dave was stopped by Denis because of his wrist.
Engin Terzi: so so then dennis was stronger because of his style they don't have to beat him in a hook you know so he was he was able to beat him yeah yeah so what i'm just saying that i mean you said that we are talking about here in my eyes leon and dennis that way or this way dennis managed to beat dave so yeah but uh in my eyes anyone who is using the bone lock of the arm
Engin Terzi: to win the match doesn't make him stronger and that's why it's like who would win you know maybe it's not okay okay okay i would say levan or levan would be dennis without step or with step both ways about it okay okay that's what i am asking yeah i understand your point as well i understand i knew that very well so but i just wanted to hear the answer this one and then you want your top five
Ivan Matyushenko: right now first of all uh now he is obviously the best and uh i think that uh unfortunately no one can uh pull him uh right now uh then uh closest to opponents um uh zaur with life and uh perhaps uh
Ivan Matyushenko: healthy Laletin I think that Laletin wasn't healthy lately he had some problems with the side pressure pulling with Dave and he also had well he had some problems after last Chechnya so I think that well I would not say that Zaur Pezulaev I would call four other people Zaur Pezulaev
Ivan Matyushenko: Laletin, Prudnik, and Gasparini. Perhaps Gasparini is the second, because maybe he would be able to open Zaur's hand. I'm not sure. Well, perhaps not. Well, so four other people are Prudnik, Gasparini, Zaur, Pizulaev, and Laletin. So these four guys, but you don't know who is who, where?
Ivan Matyushenko: Well, perhaps Zaur and Laletin, perhaps, well, I'm not sure about Zaur. Because I pulled him, his side pressure is very good. I have never felt such side pressure for many years, I would say. But I'm not sure that his wrist is so good. Because when he pulled against Laletin, Laletin was a bit tight pulling Silayev.
Ivan Matyushenko: And maybe not... How long was it? 7-8 seconds maybe? No, it was 20 seconds. That was... Well, he was not fresh after each. Engin, it was 20 seconds match. Oh, was it? Yeah. It was a good match. I kind of feel like he would stop him here.
Engin Terzi: and then he got foul and the second start it was even faster yeah the first match was 20 seconds or 20 seconds yeah yeah but do you think that you should put a little bit break to solve a little bit because the match was like
Ivan Matyushenko: uh well i think that fresh lalitin maybe he would drop rose or maybe i'm not sure i'm not sure uh but uh perhaps but zaur's side pressure is uh obviously stronger than uh lalitins than anyone others i think that um maybe it is um uh even stronger than dennis's um and checkers and checkers
Engin Terzi: You know, those names that you are giving all, I understand those Russian names, Zaur, Laletin, but can I ask you something? Do you think that there are arm wrestlers who are like totally like daisies, flowers, no injury, no pain, nothing, you know? I mean, like, do you think that after they beat Laletin, and I mean, to say that Laletin is better, I mean, should we not recognize those matches? Because once you accept a match,
Ivan Matyushenko: mean you have pain or you don't have pain or is it like it's just like saying that two boxers are fighting and the one after he loses he says that i had this pain that pain i mean the guy won you know so i see what you mean uh sorry uh well uh lalitin is injured uh so we do not count him now he is not in top five he's right i'm now right now is not in top five i would say
Ivan Matyushenko: after champion uh he had problems before chaffee and after chaffee he is uh out of the game uh for maybe half a year i think uh well that's what he said he will miss uh chechnya and he will get ready for the next year now uh but what am i saying that like whenever two guys don't pull we can have opinion this guy is better in my opinion but whenever they pull actually
Ivan Matyushenko: even that match it doesn't prove that one is better than the other one until the guy comes back and beats him like don't you think that we are discrediting dave's victory uh well maybe that is not good but there are some factors also yes um and also previous matches like uh when he puts life right uh that counts and that always comes back
Engin Terzi: that I can come back and be slave. So the last recent result, that I can be slave.
Ivan Matyushenko: Well, we should count that, I think. Yes, the victory is Dave's and the victory is Zaur's. And Farid won both Silayev and Laletin. But actually, I think, as my professional opinion, if it is professional, I think it is rather objective. I think that fresh for fresh, I would still say that Laletin maybe is the favorite against Zaur.
Engin Terzi: and some others i would say so perhaps i'm wrong perhaps no no no you are not wrong because listen once you talk about tournaments you want you talk about tournaments i understand i'm talking about not that tournament because you have a draw you have tough match but when he meets dave chaffee there is no draw there is no early match you didn't get tired you come there you bought fresh or fresh you pull so about the tournament i agree with you there are some
Engin Terzi: reasons but about the super match if you have problems injury or something you shouldn't pull once you pull that result is there so we cannot say that oh you beat him because of this because of that i mean you either don't go there don't accept the match or once the guy beats you say okay he won't right now right now he's better but i come back healthy and then once i beat him and then i say okay now i'm better so what i'm just saying that
Engin Terzi: that super matches we should not my opinion maybe i'm wrong too maybe about whenever we there is a super match we should some people says the same thing opposite way they say Dave Chaffee is the strongest guy why because he beat Morozov first two rounds but the match is best of five you need to beat the guy three times so beating a guy one time two guys two times it doesn't prove because once you accept the match you go there by knowing that you need to beat the guy three times to be better
Engin Terzi: so it's the same as boxing you know if there is no knockout you win the first three rounds five rounds but it's 12 rounds the other seven round the guy is better you cannot say that first five rounds i was better i mean you need to win you know that most of the rounds you know or you need to knock the guy out you know so this is my opinion you know just like i understand is your friend but you know if you look at from the other perspective then they say that hey listen i won the match you know
Ivan Matyushenko: And I know that the one then. So then, or maybe then Dave. Maybe morose it's it's it's very difficult to tell you. it's very it's very difficult. yeah.
Engin Terzi: Devon't, don't, because it looks like now I changed your mind or something. I respect, I'm just discussing. There are too many people. Yes, it's very difficult to find out who is the strongest. But do you agree that super matches are the absolute judgment to see who is better, more than the tournament? Sure, that's for sure. But these super matches should be not too often. And we should perhaps...
Engin Terzi: Not too often, right? Yeah. If they go too often, then there would be injuries and no top shape. Yeah, but athletes are not forced to pull. They ask him. If they say yes, they pull. They can also say no. Like, for example, I know Artem Morozov, after this event, will take a break till summer. I know Davit Dadikian is taking a break. I asked them too. They said, no, I'm going to rest.
Engin Terzi: So it is up to them, you know, say yes or no. You organize it. I ask athletes. I don't know if they are ready or not, if they want to pull or not. So this is what it is. And what is, Kasimir, your top five? And then we finish. Well, first is Levan. And after that, there's five, six people that are equal. So I cannot say after that. So you are saying that it is totally dependent on that moment, because this is also two ways.
Engin Terzi: one guy cannot be all the time in super shape he can change the shape three months ago three months yes yes and the other thing is other thing is that style makes matches sometimes even this guy beats this guy this guy can beat this guy and this guy be a good yeah
Engin Terzi: Both of these things are true. True, yeah. I mean, whenever people who knows about arm wrestling, they understand that this is the fact, you know. Your form depends. That moment, three months ago, that guy is better. Sometimes people go, oh, this guy beat him in 10 months ago. So now why you see? I mean, because he has a recent win, you know. So anyway, so I don't want to keep Ivan. Ivan is looking to his wife. I know. I told him that one hour. Sorry, Ivan, for keeping you. And
Engin Terzi: and because we are close friends that's why i openly uh share my thoughts with you i i don't mean any disrespect your opinion
Ivan Matyushenko: in some way in some way yes we can look on this uh thing from different views and that's what i would don't take it like and he invited me and then about jerry for example uh even two months ago i would say that he's in top five
Ivan Matyushenko: And I would say that he would beat both Loletin, maybe, because Loletin is a bit injured, perhaps, but that doesn't matter. And perhaps, I think he would have won Ermes. Well, I'm not sure, but perhaps, because he is a difficult opponent for top roles. Do you think that Jerry has a chance to beat Vitaly, even if Vitaly is in good shape?
Ivan Matyushenko: uh vitale no because um i think he would not uh how to say uh vitale would beat him on this charge he would not react okay so so you are saying that the reason that dave cheffy beat vitale like this it was because
Engin Terzi: Laletin was already exhausted after three or four rounds. He had some problems with his side pressure also. Evgeny here? Yes, from Chechnya, and he couldn't use side pressure effectively. You are saying that a healthy Laletin, if you would pull against Dave, you would bet on Laletin?
Ivan Matyushenko: No, no, healthy, healthy, healthy. If they hadn't pulled before, maybe. But now I'm not sure because now Dave knows how to pull Laletin and he would be able to get ready better. Now he knows his weak points. And even if Laletin is healthy, he maybe would use that move, perhaps. Yeah, but don't you think that Laletin also now knows about Dave?
Ivan Matyushenko: uh he knows yes but uh i think that it's more difficult for lalitin to uh now create something new uh against that okay i understand if it's more versatile right now yes yes yeah
Engin Terzi: anytime he was more versatile no in the past i think he was more like like drag hooking like this and then after he get top row by a few people he also started to doing outer side exactly somebody looks like yeah but if somebody hooked him now he doesn't seem as effective as before i mean the the day that we remember him in hook do you think he would lose against morozov you think in in his days
Engin Terzi: I don't know, I'm not sure about that. But once you start all the time pronating, pronating, pronating, and once somebody hooks you, now your arm doesn't want to go that way anymore. You want to go that way. Yeah, yeah. Two superchats, big growth goals. Could the very best Brzenk beat very best Denis? The best of Brzenk, best of Denis? I don't know. I would go with John.
Engin Terzi: nobody nobody beats best john nobody well it's john zhang i don't think that he could he could beat um le one that this is why and i i'm the biggest biggest ever john fan but and he won like just you remember he won you are old enough to remember that 2006 john you know just like you know he had some match with ferit but he was pulling two weight classes and he went to the where
Ivan Matyushenko: Barrett was at his best at that moment, you know. And how do you see that the best of John and best of Denis? Well, I think that that open arm, Denis's move was very effective. Yes, it is not fair move. It is not good move, I think, because it's because his arm doesn't straighten.
Ivan Matyushenko: yes but uh it's very difficult to uh to beat him there and when he understood about this match uh it was a i think later uh he found out uh that his thing before that he used other moves uh so i think that um john wouldn't um go through that uh in uh the frame uh dennis's years yeah john also can pull as long as he has pronated even his wrist like this he also
Ivan Matyushenko: this move, but you are saying that Denis would be stronger at that point. Yes, I think that, John, that it would be almost impossible to beat Denis with top roll, but it would be possible to beat Denis with hook against this move to supinate that open arm position. If you supinate it, yes, then this construction perhaps will fall. But John is not that good hook puller to do that.
Engin Terzi: And what if Dennis also goes inside? If Dennis goes... Do you think the best of John would beat Dennis inside? No. He would top roll from that position. Oh, he would go and then he would go out. Yes, but he would not be able to finish him because of that open arm position. Okay. And Big Grove Goats, Krasimir and Ivan, can you try to tell me what you think John Bersink means to you?
Engin Terzi: personally and the sport of armwrestling. What does John mean to you? What does he mean? He's the greatest of all time so far. Yeah. And do you see anyone close? No, actually. And you, Ivan? No. What is John to you? Well, the best example of armwrestler to my mind
Engin Terzi: And perhaps, yes. Yeah, very well said. The icon of unrest. The living icon of unrest. Yeah, yeah, yeah. People, whenever I talk about John, they are like, oh, you're an extreme, you're all the time talking about him, you know this. They don't understand. They don't understand in his best days what he meant to us. He was going on stage and we were like this, like we saw an alien.
Engin Terzi: and watching him you know it was just like a different for us you know just he was just incredible and black paul thank you for your support ivan and krasy versus prudnik at 110 kilo what do they think probably 815. would you would you like to pull against him 115 kilo i don't know under 105 you would be like this to be 115.
Ivan Matyushenko: I would pull him 105, no more than 105. Not 115. And you, Ivan, would you like to pull him? 115 kilo. I'd like to, but frankly speaking, I think that he is the favorite and he has better side pressure and hook. So I have few chances right now. But perhaps I'm ready to pull him left hand.
Engin Terzi: I have a question for you. If you come to East vs. West, hopefully it will happen. Do you think that you have good chances to become the world champion in professional East vs. West with left arm 150 kg? Yes, I think that I have a big chance to become first left hand.
Ivan Matyushenko: Well, some chances, right hand, some chances, but maybe later, yes. I know that your right arm had been injured, you know, how is it doing now? Is it better? No, it's okay, yes, it's okay, but it's, how to say, I cannot pull it often. If I pull at your event or in Chechnya in December right now, then I will not be able to pull for three or four months because it aches. I have some chronic injuries. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: so i can pull it to maybe three times a year or yeah or even two times yes left arm is ready uh left arm is good yes okay okay so hopefully hopefully we will see we miss you pulling we missed that that you know the quick hook moment yeah yeah anyway so thank you yeah yeah i mean no i mean we really need need uh those special people it is not that easy
Engin Terzi: to raise them you know and then they come to a point they these guys are you know uh the community needed we will see you know anyways guys thank you very very much and hopefully you guys will enjoy the show on november 19th are you coming krasimir or no i will be commentating through my youtube channel oh you will seriously yes yes yeah whenever you're commenting tell them often
