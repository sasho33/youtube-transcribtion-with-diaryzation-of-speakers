Engin Terzi: I will frame it. I will also have one sign because this is probably the best Supermatch organization in the history, in my opinion, as well. Not because I'm organizing. And I would like to keep it as a memory, this one, with all those signatures of great athletes. This is my
Engin Terzi: social media sponsor, Paul's Labs. And if you order from them, you will have a 10% discount with the code TENGIN. You will find the details in the description link. And they are also one of the sponsors of the event. So let's wait. By the way, I started trainings.

Hello, guys. Hello, Abib. Yeah, I was just thinking, did you guys think that, you know, that what was that little Prudnik, you know, song that Devon was singing and then some of the other songs that Prudnik was singing?
Engin Terzi: Maybe we should play those, you know, while they are entering the stage. Do you think it's a good idea? No, Devon will join in three minutes. I gave him the link. So in three minutes, he should be coming. I have no idea. I think that there will be a trash talk. I believe so. After all that, if they just, you know,
Engin Terzi: suddenly hug and kiss each other you know i will be surprised but who knows what they plan jd hello hello my friend um yeah i'm expecting to matter yeah there is three minutes they have yeah they can make it in two minutes

James P best promotion I have seen. Yeah, it's fun. Yeah. Harold, this interview is going to be fun. Can't wait. Sirius Francis, hello. Hello, my friend, Caroline.
Engin Terzi: I mean, that's great news. Blood flow serving you well. Oxygen boosts the cells. Yeah. Yeah. Whenever I just wait, it doesn't feel good. You know, I need to really do some flight training. Why do you desperately want to see everyone lose? It's your imagination, my friend. It's your imagination. Like Einstein said that, you know, breaking prejudice is harder than
Engin Terzi: breaking atoms, you know, so that is the kind of problems you guys have. Zaid. Hello, Engin. Hope you're doing well. Malstar. Hello from Scotland. Hope you're well. Thank you, my friend. Hello to Scotland. Thank you for the support, my friend. Thank you. Yeah, I expected this. A lot of people. Engin aging younger. Not
Engin Terzi: older yeah pedro says best promoter thank you my friend thank you devon is the best loser i don't know what that means enigma hustle strap that one definitely played yep they have one minute can't wait for this full strength says ali al-hassan you haven't said your prediction
Engin Terzi: I can make it not the prediction. I cannot. I'm an organizer. If I make a prediction like the guy that a while ago, you know, there's some prejudice, you know, mentality. So they will start talking a lot of things. So it's better to just organize and stay away from the prediction. J.R. Williams, what's up? Not much, my friend. Same thing, different day.
Engin Terzi: but okay this is a development over here eight o'clock so we are waiting connor i'm doing well my friend is this match your personal favorite from the cart um there are a lot of them will engine pull one day i'm trying i'm training my friend i would just attend with him jesus comes stand by him
Engin Terzi: It's the best exercise to get stronger. It's the wrong time to talk about it. Thank you, Engin, for doing this podcast. You're welcome, Mask. And thank you for the support. Organizing an event, this kind of event, is harder than competing with my friend. Trust me. Trust me. Dr. Hugo Bones, this is going to be it. Dave Kratos, where is the beard? I shaved.
Engin Terzi: um don't let refugees change the rules for the universe but no no no no the rules are the same for everyone is neil pick up signing the t-shirts no and now you know you is promised no my friend i can't even train with my uh junior students right now there will be time there will be time that i will but not now
Engin Terzi: um mr nicotine i don't bet it's against my belief rapid engine is direct seven versus brittany what injuries are you working through okay this is two minutes they are like guys two minutes it means that i am giving you both of you one more warning and one foul each and then if you don't come in another minute
Engin Terzi: I will disqualify both of you and I'm going to get the title. Okay. And I will never give it back. Two minutes. Okay. What is wrong with these guys?
Engin Terzi: find out just give me a second where they are if they wrote me that they cannot enter or something that you check um okay easy okay you should automatically
Unknown: One second. He's asking me code, but. And there's seven. Right, again.
Engin Terzi: Okay, Devon is asking me. Okay, yeah, he came right here. Okay, Prudnik didn't come. So Prudnik didn't come, so we are giving second foul to Prudnik and personal Devon wins. Devon, you are already automatically 1-0 because the guy, you both have two warnings. It means that one foul, so he didn't come. So now...
Engin Terzi: putting against the second foul, so you are 1-0 now. Yeah. That's the way it should be. Yeah, that's the way it should be. See, you didn't mind. Oh, who is this? I saw a god. I saw an effing god. What are you talking about, man? Are we live right now? Yes, we are. Yeah, we are.
Engin Terzi: So where is this chump that I'm going to take the title from? I think he's afraid of you. That is what I think. Hello, John. How are you, my friend? Hello. Yeah, I wasn't sure if I made it. I noticed that you didn't have anybody on your show, so I figured I'd log in real quick. This is great. You know what happened, Devon? We figured out that Prudnik is afraid of you, so we had to do a quick replacement. So that is why I invited John.
Devon Larratt: and very good yeah yeah okay john what's your chances against devon since you are the replacement oh well um yeah since the last practice i my chances are probably uh not very good um but you know me i can i can maybe step it up a little bit come tournament time if what are the rules you're not going to put me directly in a strap with a guy are you
Engin Terzi: no no no you're not you're not you're not gonna let him put the strap on right no no no no no okay my chances are a little better the webbing just is so high though the webbing is so high up there don't worry we're gonna we're gonna make his webinar so low he will be driving from like down here you know don't worry about it yeah yeah john uh what do you think about this match honestly
Devon Larratt: what is your i mean opinion well i don't i don't have any experience really knowing uh how strong evgeny is i don't know how strong he's in a hook i don't know what his ability to shut down a top role really is other than what i've witnessed i mean he seems to be the most capable of of shutting down uh that pronation and that top role um better than probably anybody in the sport other than maybe
Devon Larratt: But I mean, what I felt against Devon two weeks ago makes me believe that Devon will be a heavy favorite because, you know, I don't know. I just feel like, yeah, well, if he's got chances, obviously, I mean, if he's able to somehow quickly turn Devon's hand upward, avoid the strap and be very explosive. I mean, I think he's capable to put him out of position enough for
Devon Larratt: he could possibly get a winner or two, but boy, the guy that I felt two weeks ago is, is incredibly strong. And he's got that great, you know, better than I've ever felt that stop that pronation stop. So it's not even really, he doesn't even really need to do a King's move. It's just a, a good, just good, hard rotation. So I I'm curious to see what a Guinea is going to attempt. Is he going to try to control him inside initially, or is he going to try to fight outside? It'll be interesting.
Devon Larratt: very interesting to see what he, he elects to do on the very first match. But, you know, I would definitely advise him to try to stay calm and not, uh, you know, not get, uh, too worked up and pumped up, uh, during the setup, but, um, to try to make it so it doesn't go to the strap and be super explosive and try to get Devon out of position. I mean, um,
Devon Larratt: Yeah, and on the flip side, I mean, Devon, I just think just he needs to stop it. And from what I felt, I mean, I have no doubt that he's going to be able to stop it at some point. Possibly the first round, but for sure the second, third rounds. So, yeah, advantage. Advantage, definitely Devon. Ooh, what's that? Look at the pronator. Wow. I thought it was Photoshop. It's real. Ooh. Oh, there he is. There's Evgeny.
Engin Terzi: are you intimidated i am you are shocked right you are shocked yeah yeah yeah do you do you want me to replace your match with john instead of you uh repeat please i mean if you are afraid i can set john against devon instead of you
Devon Larratt: still want to pull no no no no no it's okay i'm happy he's ready yeah are you doing the flood flooding of water at this point now devin are you doing like gallons of water to do like the water cut here come tuesday wednesday i just done
Devon Larratt: Devon't drink water. It's something else. It's not water. This is a new thing. Everybody should try it. I actually thought about doing the same because I'm about 233, 234 and I thought I'm going to actually be right there. When are you going to be?
Devon Larratt: 231, I think is the weight class, 105. So yeah, no, I, yeah, but I mean, you never know. I mean, flying on an airplane for 24 hours and so, but anyway, I've never been really any good at doing those water cuts, but. I actually, I've been, I've been telling a little bit of a lie, believe it or not. I don't know. I'm actually 290 right now. I love you.
Devon Larratt: I might not make the weight. I might not make it. We are not going to tell you to go back to Canada. He's still going to pull it. He's 132 kilos. This is his 290. The match is on, right? I mean, I am what I am. You just won't get the title. You'll just have to pay a penalty fee and you won't get the title. Doesn't matter. I'm coming in. Maybe by the time I show up, I'll be 300. Yeah. Right.
Engin Terzi: Did you hear that? He's 132 kilos, 290 pounds. Is that okay? Yeah. Yeah. Very good. Very good. M4CL, thank you for your support. Roman, SG Records, love you guys. Thank you for your time. Great show. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Okay. What do you have to say? You have anything to say to Devon?
Evgeny Prudnik: I want to ask Devon, I heard that Jody will come to Istanbul as well. Yes, I think she's coming. She wants desperately to meet you. Wow, super. I am happy. I'm happy because your balls will be near to you.
Devon Larratt: right yeah they'll be right there with me yeah yeah no of course if of course only if she doesn't forget her person uh yes good point good point of getting a good point um you know listen evgeny i i i was ready to take this match the second that it was proposed to me i'm so ready i feel like
Devon Larratt: I feel like I was ready for this match. Like baby. Yeah. Like, right. Like, I'm like, I feel like I'm 28. Like dirt. Like dirt. Like dirt? Like dirt and golden cage. Oh, listen. And there's another thing. There's another thing. Evgeny, I think you're such a smart guy. But you are so spoon-fed at this point. Like...
Devon Larratt: man those words aren't even yours i hear them loud and clear i hear them loud and clear it's like you know do you know evgeny do you know what a puppet is a puppet you know puppet a puppet like yeah yeah hello my name is evgeny
Devon Larratt: Do you know about a puppet? I know stories about birds. No, no, no, no. I'm saying, I'm saying, you know, like, you know, like, like a marionette, you know, like in the opera, how they have like people like and they and they hold them on strings and they walk them out and they do things. Toys, toys. Yeah. Yeah. Like a marionette, like a puppet. I don't know if I have.
Evgeny Prudnik: I understand about you, but I don't understand why you say this, because I want to say you this history about the birds who are used to living in cage. Oh, is that where it comes from? Can't live outside of the cage. A very original of you to come up with this idea.
Devon Larratt: That wood is why you are successful outside of North America. Very interesting. Evgeny, it would be better if you thought of me as a bird of prey, not a bird in a cage, a bird of prey that only feasts upon the most tasty meals. And it just so happens that all the best meals have been in North America for some time now. Why didn't you come to the WAL? We gave more money.
Devon Larratt: you would have been rich you would have you would have already been so far ahead why did you not come uh i'm prepared for oh no because igor had his golden golden cage in your golden igor had your balls
Evgeny Prudnik: you had them you're you're you're like uh eagles eagle yes eagle eagle uh fly fly very very high very high and then he can't believe that somebody attacked him uh over understand
Devon Larratt: eagles and attack over he can't believe in this that somebody can attack him over oh but i am i am flying i fly higher than you no did you watch that movie um what's that movie with uh where they go and get the big dragon what's that movie the movie with they're on the different hey no not never hey the canada thing
Devon Larratt: it's it's where the people are blue avatar avatar yes hey that's that's that's that's where you got that idea right yeah the bird never attack never expects it from above but dude dude i've been watching you you're the pal was down here the wal was up here and now
Devon Larratt: here's east versus west coming down coming down to get you i just feel bad i just feel that igor had your balls for so long and that you didn't get to come and play with us that one one second one thing you are saying wl is here east versus west here no no no no i'm saying that this is a new platform w pal was down here
Devon Larratt: okay i feel i always felt bad for all these guys all these great athletes competing in this inferior league with no money no nothing starving cold shivering you know wl life of life of opulent my stomach was always full you know i mean those was super matches were not they were not imitational
Engin Terzi: super matches yeah they invited the best the best hey prudnik have they ever invited you to wl double uh the answer is i'll answer it for him the answer is yes he was too wild too wild did they invite you my wife
Devon Larratt: No, no, why? Why? WAL, the American League. Let me stop you so you can frame the question properly, because you didn't even need an invitation for the first few years. You didn't even need one. Yes, but the Supermatches, have you ever been invited? All the money was in the first few years anyways. All the big, like the year that John won, what'd you win, John? $20,000? Did you get an invite, John? I can catch you.
Evgeny Prudnik: uh talk i can catch told because many people uh tell and very quickly i want to say john brzenk has a good car my good what john brzenk has a good car a good car yeah you want it with all that wal prize money for nick i thought this was going to start at noon so i i went to my uh wife's parents place so i'm out in their driveway right now
Engin Terzi: In the top eight, in one year, how much money did you make? Me, personally? In one year? $20,000. Okay. Anyways, there is a super chat. I love the back and forth between Devon and Evgeny.
Engin Terzi: Prudnik Engin, can you make available a t-shirt for the fans with all of Devon's excuses in the last week? Maybe add a poster for any overflow. They want me to make a poster with your excuses, they say. I'll list them. I'll list them. Okay, first one, short notice. Very short notice. Second one, I have a torn bicep.
Devon Larratt: okay so you want me to make t-shirt with those yeah yeah good t-shirt good t-shirt three uh i'm old and arthritic okay my excuse i feel you john i feel you let's go let's go four and we'll keep it at four no balls no no there is there is but they're in the purse yeah listen
Engin Terzi: That that night when you guys call me and wake me up that maybe you don't remember, but I wanted to say, because I was asleep, I said, I wanted to say that the whole North America is waiting. For you to save them but accident that I said.
Devon Larratt: the whole North America is waiting for you to be saved. And you were like, save me, you know? But later, a week later, it became to that point. So I put it in again, Ermes, we had to save you. And I appreciate that. It was a twist of faith that you got this old, ball-less, arthritic, short notice taking man to come to your event. But the crazy thing is, is that just tells you where is the level.
Devon Larratt: where is the level when an old man look at i haven't checked my phone but i think that i'm still leading on armbet nobody thinks pernick's gonna win it blows me away i don't understand why another question but but devon were you leading against levanto no
Devon Larratt: no it was a shutout stake i only had to win one with lavon on the polls you know on social media the last week nobody thought i was gonna win i don't think i mean i think people thought i was gonna win one round you know oh but no when we wrote that they were like 55 you were gonna win 45 uh he was really
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah i can show you but it's it is because probably they wanted you to win that's why they work that way that's my opinion but money talks money talks ultimately money talks yeah another thing devon when you say like short notice did i offer you this match or you wanted to pull um how did it work i don't remember you called me and i said i said that the match is canceled you were like this and i said
Engin Terzi: I already put on social media, and if you don't accept the match, I will call you a chicken or something. You were like this. And I said, Pritnik already accepted. You were like this. I said, I'm just joking. This is only like three weeks. And you were like, no, four weeks or something. I don't know how many. And you were like, no, I'm seriously. And I was like, are you serious? Are you going to accept the match that short notice? And you were like, yes, I'm going to accept. I was just like shocked. I was only joking.
Evgeny Prudnik: Well, I like to go and get beat up by these young champs. That's what I like to do. Let's see. And Prudnik, what are you going to do to this guy? I kill him. I kill him. Before the fight. I love it.
Engin Terzi: I love it. Yeah. Dave you seen my tattoo? Yeah. Can you read it? Fucking quit. Yeah. Quit. Quit. The match started and you catch him. He cannot pin you. Are you going to make him suffer?
Evgeny Prudnik: i was hoping that i could entice him to sing me a song yes i catch i catch you and he will keep you and sing your song and after beat you one second yes this is what i want this is my this yeah this is what last in last in last match last match yeah yeah
Devon Larratt: But when I, when I will play with you, I joke around a lot. I joke around about being an old and weak and broken man, which, you know, it is true, but at the same time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think you're a great guy.
Devon Larratt: I think you are, but. I don't like what I have to do to you, but I have to do it. I have to do it. It's. The match is going to stop. It's going to stop. And it will become very ugly to a point that I will probably hate myself as much as your fans hate me. I will.
Evgeny Prudnik: People think that I'm a psychopath, but I genuinely feel remorse. I do. I feel bad about the things that I do. I do. I feel bad about it. I'm going to do terrible things to you, Prudnik. Listen to me. I see that you became respectful after your experience with Levan. And now after, I think after our fight,
Devon Larratt: you will become the most respectful guy in the community john is that possible john is this isn't the future that in any way is possible oh my god i can see the people at waft just they're losing their minds right now maybe i should run for waft president
Devon Larratt: that's it okay listen i'll i'll say it now if you beat me if you beat me okay what do you mean if i will wear it i'll wear a suit i'll clean up and uh and i'll try and get arm wrestling into the olympics or something very respectful lots of shaking hands lots of bowing no no trash talking but if i win if i win
Evgeny Prudnik: You will become a respectful guy, yeah? The future of the sport. If I beat you, you will become a respectful guy. Most respectful guy in the community. Yeah? Okay, okay. And if I beat you, you will come to Canada. You will come to Canada.
Engin Terzi: and you will work in the opera here so that i can come and hear you sing any night of the week that i like okay okay if you if you if you're a super test sorry you want you but wait i thought devon didn't pull for money remember he said that he pulls for the love of the game to john at king of the table to press conference he says
Devon Larratt: Life is full of contradictions. It's full of contradictions. You know, it's true. I pull for love. I mean, I pulled yesterday. I pulled yesterday at a tournament here in Ottawa. And I think I made $5 every time I won a match. You know. Aaron, guys name. Two questions for Devon. What is Devon's hair going to look like for this match? And did he ever beat his 75 pounds post-race record?
Devon Larratt: You are all amazing. I think I beat it. Yeah, I did beat it, but not by much. And my hair, I'm probably not going to do anything special. I feel like this is just a heavyweight title. So I think I don't need to shave my head.
Devon Larratt: I watched one of your podcasts the other day. I think it was yesterday, the day before yesterday. Did Jody fix your hair to make you look like Wolverine? Because your hair was actually forward a little bit with the beard. I thought, oh, he's coming in as Wolverine. There it is. It's coming. It's coming. I can almost do it a bit. Devon, Devon, Devon.
Devon Larratt: not bad okay i look like an older version of you prudnik this is what you have to look forward to sweden arm wrestling television will devon do a head drop on prudnik if he wins yeah i feel like see i'm i'm an original guy okay i write my own songs
Devon Larratt: I say my own lines. I have my own moves. I don't copy Todd Hutchings. I don't get fed by Igor Mazarenko or Engin Terzi. I'm my own man. I'm my own man. I do my own thing. What are you talking about, John? No, he's right. He's right. He's right about what?
Devon Larratt: he's his old man i mean i i don't think he should be rubbing anybody's head i mean i i think um i think his stick is uh to get people to quit right so that's what i'm expecting is the is the pin yourself uh uh thing to come out of his mouth everybody knows todd hutchings is the original head rubber okay right right yeah that's that's the hutchins thing when todd hutchings beat a guy from another country he said now he owns this country so when he loses he lost the the patent
Devon Larratt: or the head rubbing to Prudnik. And Prudnik, will you rub Devon's head after you beat him, if you beat him? Devon, do you want it? Oh, yes, desperately. Desperately. You want it. Of course I do this. Yes. Now, I was thinking what I might do. What I might do is I might put a comb in my back pocket.
Devon Larratt: Because if, if I feel victory, I was thinking now, can we talk about the rules for a second? Because we really haven't talked about the rules. Yeah. Okay. So in, in WAF or whatever rule system you're using, cause it, to me, it just seemed like, you know, it's not really WAF. It's like WAF light. Okay. But let me, so if I'm arm wrestling, no advantage game.
Engin Terzi: no advantage gained i can take my hand off the pin peg right yeah and then you need to put it back okay but i need to put it back or or what like if there's no advantage listen listen listen um it needs to be by a mistake or something
Devon Larratt: I mean, you cannot just go there and do like this, you know? People figure out that you shouldn't do that, you know? Why? Yeah, that's okay. What do you want to do? Do you want to take some brush or what? I was thinking about combing my hair, yeah. I was thinking about combing my hair because if he's not going to rub my hair, then I'm, you know, I want to comb my hair maybe. Yeah. While I'm in the match. Because there wouldn't be an advantage, right? Like I could comb my hair. This is not an advantage gained. I'm not gaining an advantage.
Evgeny Prudnik: Prudnik, do you understand what he's saying? Yeah. Engin, can you ask about something during our fight? Something bring me a coffee. Bring you what? Someone bring me a coffee during our fight with Devon.
Evgeny Prudnik: we uh you want to drink a cup of coffee while he's arm resting when we when we when we uh pull him when we will we'll pull yeah with devil yeah yeah and uh can you ask something some somewhere no somewhere some one someone
Devon Larratt: Bring me coffee during the fight. I think we need to clarify this rule because there's no advantage gained. So I feel like if you want to drink a coffee when you arm wrestle me, I would be fine with it. I think that's fine. How would you handle this situation? What do you do with these guys? One wants coffee, the other one wants to brush his hair or something? Yeah, yeah.
Devon Larratt: John, how do you suggest we handle this situation? It would definitely be hilarious. I was expecting it to be a more serious conversation and then Prudnik would leave the conversation. But evidently, this is a much better scenario than what I expected was to be coming. My advice for you, Prudnik, is
Devon Larratt: you know you probably you probably won't want coffee you'll probably want painkillers so like morphine americano with milk please morphine maybe maybe antidepressants and you can start taking antidepressants while we're arm wrestling because afterwards you might be a little bit sad
Engin Terzi: little bit there is another super chat sub b right but the sub b it says list of right-handed wins against europeans from devon is still loading from australia right-handed who have i arm wrestled it's a european i mean who came i mean it's it's not really notable because nobody's been on my level like
Devon Larratt: I mean, who did I even arm wrestle? I feel like I arm wrestled LeVon and everybody else was just not worthy. The first one was Taras and LeVon. You're talking about in like 1983 when I was what, eight years old?
Engin Terzi: no no year before year before uh you beat rambet and two years before you beat john in manchester oh geez i don't even remember that was like 20 years ago yeah that guy doesn't even exist anymore that guy is like 31 years old whatever yeah craig rap devon please sing yeah big boy when you are up six zero that only works against a big boy
Evgeny Prudnik: oh like media yeah medium boy middle middle yeah middle-sized boy yeah get ready listen after our fight our fight after our fight you will be uh light boy light heavy boy
Evgeny Prudnik: light heavyweight champion boy right anyway yeah because after i beat you you will go down in the light heavyweight uh engine can you set uh champion again can you set uh already a match
Devon Larratt: between between demon and under bio because after our match he will go down to light heavyweight and after i beat him i might do that i might actually do that my plan is so 115 champion 105 champion and all roads end with
Devon Larratt: the puppet master and you know who that is right evgeny you know who the puppet master is and after you will pull with uh the puppet master a lightweight exactly exactly so i don't know yeah yeah
Devon Larratt: one by one the europeans will fall one by one one by one evgeny you've caught you guys have taunted me with this oh devon doesn't pull europeans now i'm coming for one after the other is i'm going to get a fence in my house and i'm going to put like a picture of your head on each one of them i won't actually take your head obviously i won't do that
Devon Larratt: but i'm just gonna make a plastic of it you know and then again i'll get the erasic to make like one of her sculptures you know put it yeah listen at my song today for you about it's not your song it's not your song yesterday don't pretend with me don't pretend with me evgeny i know much better when i hear the words i know you have a ghost writer okay i know you're
Devon Larratt: can't fool me say you want to say it's uh song sink not me it's not me seeing this song you're a very good singer it's you're a very good singer i just don't hear you in those lyrics i just don't hear you no i hear someone else and you're singing the song that's the thing and i can tell i can tell when it comes from someone's soul i can see it
Devon Larratt: It's not your soul. So I commend your singing. It's very good singing. Yes. But we like. Yes, I like it's beautiful, beautiful singing. Yes. Listen, after after I'm going to I'm going to offer you a job at the Canadian Opera House. OK, and it'll be great. It'll be great. Yeah, you'll come. You'll come and you'll live here.
Devon Larratt: And we can train together. You can have matches with Porkchop, Matt Mask, and guys like Sylvain Perron, all the North American guys. You can come to my golden cage, and I will let you in the door. I will let you in. Okay. John, what is the percentage of winning chances with these two gentlemen?
Devon Larratt: Oh, like I said earlier, I just I have no real idea other than what I've witnessed against other competitors. I think he's just going to he's going to have to do everything right and be super clean. And if he does one thing wrong, it's going to be a bad day. But I think he's you know, he's if he stays clean and and hits hard, I think he's got a chance to win. I'm not I'm not going to say
Devon Larratt: um you know i hate to just throw the normal numbers out there but i'm going to say he's closer than probably a lot of people think uh i'll say 60 40 60 40 devon um and then that's that's if evgeny well evgeny's got to do everything right he's got to not allow the refs to you know he's got to not allow devin to dictate the match the referee's got to be on his side he's got a conservative got to be the referees are already on his side
Devon Larratt: It's East versus West in Istanbul. And he's there. Okay. Trust me. Come on. You have to try to stay out of the straps. Do not allow. Devon't be lazy and just decide it's going to go to the straps right away. Hold on.
Devon Larratt: Hold on for dear life. You have to tee off on him, Evgeny. You have to hit him so hard and so confidently and not be hesitant at all. Because if you're hesitant at all, it's going to be a bad day. You will have to be perfect, Evgeny. Perfect. Like John said, everything will have to be perfect.
Devon Larratt: One mistake, Evgeny, and the whole house of cards is going to fall apart. But if anyone can do it, Evgeny, it's you. It's you, okay? When we are alone, you don't say these kind of things, you know, the referees will be, engine is there. You have doubts on my fairness. Oh, that would be silly to assume that there would be any bias with a guy like me coming to Istanbul.
Engin Terzi: you know what i feel that whenever you cannot do your things you feel like you are cheated if everything starts you know like equally you know there's this perception out there that i'm some kind of an arm wrestling cheater but when do you ever see me take the uh john you know because john john and i one of the live shows he said that he said that they asked him
Engin Terzi: Pradeep asked him, who asked you? Pradeep probably. And then he said, who is the number one cheater? And John, name you. Engin, don't try and form a wedge between the Western team. John and I are buddies. We're teammates. We're coming over to destroy you guys, okay? We drank maca together. What do you mean you guys? You guys, I am organized. I am right there, you know, right at the middle of the East and West.
Devon Larratt: just don't like have you ever felt such thing john it's it's ask how touching ask anyone you want you know if you start everything there's some pretty shady stuff with zurab i'll tell you like watching you and zurab there are some pretty shady calls yeah you don't have to be biased they just they well it's not that they're going to be biased it's just that they have to be very tough they have to
Devon Larratt: they have to take control more than they probably are accustomed to or devon will control and it has no real out because if if he tries to fight for control it goes right down the path of of of ruin of you know down devon's road so it's it's a tough situation i mean how do you how do you how do you negotiate that when somebody you know trying to take every advantage
Devon Larratt: Whoa, whoa, whoa, John, John. I mean, I command you for it. I mean, it's that's like, okay, hold on a second. Let's just, let's just put things out there.
Devon Larratt: are john are you saying that i am the only one who's trying to take advantage no no no you're like dave patton in my mind you you've never come up to the table and and decided to like okay i'm gonna let a little rope i'm gonna let i'm gonna test myself with this guy and make him feel like he has everything he needs and wants i think i think your mindset is to go up there
Devon Larratt: and make this guy squirm, make him feel as uncomfortable as possible. And I mean, that's just your approach. I mean, it's a good approach. I like it. But yeah, it's based off of respect. You know, like if I if I respect my opponent, I will fight. Yesterday, I competed at the Ottawa Open. I let people start in a hook. I let people start wherever they wanted. I gave them whatever they wanted.
Devon Larratt: You know, I wouldn't do that at East versus West or Canada Table, you know, but here at the Ottawa Open, I'm quite friendly. Right. That's why I have been trying to tease you on social media. So you wouldn't respect him. So you would just give everything. Oh, no, that works the opposite way. No, I'm I'm. But listen, he should be I don't understand why he shouldn't be so nice to me. I am a cripple.
John Brzenk: i should start posting don't how am i am i an old broken dude getting him out of bed in the morning requires quite an amount of effort i actually just got up effort i just got up and it's noon it's afternoon now just woke up are you nervous are you nervous he's like yeah because she is so judy do i make you nervous evgeny no
John Brzenk: I would never be mean. I'm a very kind person. I don't know why anyone ever feels like that's the opposite. I'm really looking forward to getting to know you. What's that again? Evgeny the way that you say that these things sounds very dangerous, I would never hurt anybody. I wouldn't. No, it's my mom.
John Brzenk: I promise not to bring my purse. That's a whole other conversation. Really looking forward to getting to know you, Evgeny, next week. It's going to be a lot of fun. I can't wait. I'll see you. Thank you. Bye-bye. He's like, just please go away. I cannot talk comfortably. What I have to live with all the time. You see that?
Engin Terzi: That's why I am the way I am, okay? I'm a nice guy. I've been shaped this way. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of questions I missed. I need to go and I don't want to be disrespectful to the guy. Devon's brain started buffering when he was asked for the truth. John won against you, Devon. Nobody counts your Kings movie. Sub B. Oh, this is still the Sub B. Listen, I don't want to...
Devon Larratt: john and my conflict is a thing of the past okay now the same team team west right in the west that's right we are coming for you yes do not try and divide us we are united okay we are coming we are coming to bleed out the europeans take your blood back to north america where we're going to take from you we are coming to plunder plunder
Evgeny Prudnik: heard that prudently day before days before the fight is your best day why because i weigh in you can because you can good speak speak speak about fight about your winner and victory and and companies this days before the fight you are your is best day days how about competition day
Devon Larratt: And the competition day, it's my day. I don't know. Tell your friends to go and bet money on you. Tell your friends to go and make money by placing wagers on you, by placing stakes on you. You understand, Prudnik? You said that your friends should bet money on you on the betting website. Why?
Devon Larratt: because if they think that you are gonna win they should do that because devon says that everyone is betting on devon nobody is betting on you it's what he says uh how it's possible if i uh if win i win yeah if you win you win money yeah you can go like you can go like if you're so sure that you're gonna win you can go and buy out your blocks on our bench yeah and then you make even more money
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah eb talks can you ask evgeny if he will show up in his true blue form evgeny prudnik not even levan could stop him when evgeny was painted in blue are you gonna come with blue uh like a gym like like you were colored like blue you know as your like profile picture uh maybe if you give me a pain
Engin Terzi: If I give you a paint? Okay. I have a question for you guys. Like, till now, the best team, I think, that West brought was in May when John said that, what did you say, John? You're going to clean the floor, mop the floor with them? Mop the floor, yep. Yep. Yeah. And it ended 5-5, like five win for the East and five win for the West, it was.
Engin Terzi: and it was the best team that John thought that they were going to destroy them. So do you guys think that this time it is possible West to win more than the East if we consider the match? John Petrenko, Matt versus Sandris, Devon Yu versus Prudnik, and Dave versus Ermes Gasparini, Pauline Gamtenadze, Adam Bozhidar, and Justin Bishop with
Devon Larratt: Mindaugas, how do you see that it's possible? East will win. Of course, East will win. East has that advantage of sleeping in well, being on the right time zone. They're not 24 hours on an airplane.
Engin Terzi: So yeah, they're going to have that advantage. Dave them come to Las Vegas one weekend and go against the West. You are in Devon. Let's do that at least once a year in USA together. Three of us. You think any of the Easterners will come over? That's a long flight. I will bring them. I will bring them, of course. Come on. You're going to take the team and you're going to tell me and we will try to find
Engin Terzi: equal equal matches matchups we will discuss together because when we say east and west we're talking about canada u.s two countries while here we have like 20 countries different countries so it is not super fair you know when we say east and west you're talking and canadians just one on two matt and him you know devon other than that mostly was the team u.s
Engin Terzi: And so it was like most likely USA versus the world, you know, it was, you know, so you guys did very well, you know, in fact, you know, there's been one country. Devon't you agree? Justin one country. Devon't you agree? Devon't you agree that it's only like when you say West, you're talking about most, most of the times one country. And now we have two pullers from Canada, Matt and Devon. So it is not really fair.
Engin Terzi: to say East versus West, while East can be Georgii, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, you know, before some Russian. Five country best, or what do you mean? I mean, when we say like West, till now we were talking mostly about one country, but when you say East, you're talking about five countries, you understand?
Engin Terzi: yeah so it's not really they're all small countries one country one country from uh east or from west no west west don't you see west america is only america is only like now we we're talking about many others like mindagas is lithuania sandris is latvia and then uh in the morals of kazakhstan we have georgians we have ukrainians so many many of the guys from yeah
Engin Terzi: different countries and then when we talk about the west we're talking now only two countries and devon is that enough to beat the eastern country you missed you know and again i'm not even thinking about any of that stuff that you're talking about yeah focus on kicking disguises yeah i mean all that stuff sounds great but i mean i only have one i have a very simple one track mind
Devon Larratt: So you talk to me later. Yeah. Yeah. What's your what's your when you leave and you leave on Tuesday, Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday, and you're flying. How long is your trip going to be? It's. Yeah. So I have to find a way to get to Montreal on Wednesday night and we fly direct right to Istanbul. Oh, yeah. We'll get to Istanbul Thursday afternoon and
Devon Larratt: And then Friday morning, I weigh in. So my plan is probably once I get on that plane, I'm just gonna relax and not drink or eat anything, see how much I weigh when I land, get my weight right. You know, it's a long cut from 290 all the way to 253, right? So, you know, I'll hit my weight in the morning and then get fat for 36 hours and then enjoy the song.
Devon Larratt: yeah what is your what is your weight now in kilo you know bigger than you evgeny bigger 150 kilo i'm huge ever since i saw you just eating and eating pancakes every day
Devon Larratt: You leave your legs somewhere before waiting. Oh, listen, I mean, Engin and I already have a deal. Devon't you worry about it. Your weight will be 115. Listen, Engin and I do our way in and close doors. Nobody has to see. We've already made a deal.
Devon Larratt: Evgeny, don't you worry about my weight, okay? Evgeny if I look like 300 pounds, I'm 253 pounds. I personally will see on your weight in the waiting. No matter how scary I am, I'm 253 pounds. And I personally tear off your arm. Devon't worry. Listen, Evgeny, I was thinking...
Devon Larratt: because i like you and um and i want to help you in your personal development and i thought um you know there's this touching subject of desperation which i have explored for my entire life desperation desperation evgeny and and i think that it would be great for you
Devon Larratt: as an artist as an athlete to not get any more lines from whoever you're getting your lines from and i want you to visualize when you're at the table with me as i sink into desperation and it will force you to feel my desperation and you yourself will become desperate and and i think that this is this is an interesting song you could write
Devon Larratt: a song of desperation is it my desperation or is it your desperation one of us one of us will reach out of that murky darkness and seize glory okay i already know that i'm very comfortable being desperate i live my whole life there but i think that you have had an easier life than me i think that you you know at 34 i think life has been easy for you
Devon Larratt: And I think I'm going to take you into my world. Welcome to my desperate world, Evgeny. That's what you should call it. Welcome to my desperate world. And you can sing it. Welcome to my desperate world. I don't know how you do. You're better than me. Or maybe Engin, write it to him and send it to him. I have no idea about how to write songs. Ah.
Devon Larratt: uh yeah put that on a polygraph and see what comes up yeah yeah like i i believe you ain't gonna say i believe you the same way i think that the reffing will be fair but it won't matter it will not matter because i've had to deal with bart my entire career so
Engin Terzi: So you made a deal with me about your way in, but when you go to the table, everything will be the opposite way, huh? I expect confrontation. I expect to have to fight the entire room. You see that John, he says that he has a deal with me about his weight, but now when he goes to the table, he thinks that the things will not be fair for him. And should I write that on the t-shirt as well, about your excuses? Oh yeah, that's another good one, yeah. Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Engin Terzi: i have a question seriously devon um you know it is true or not true but people a lot of people criticize you for not being um pulling enough against eastern europeans for that reason or this reason no that reason or this reason um they didn't come or you didn't go it doesn't matter do you see this as an opportunity to at least because prudent is like like
Engin Terzi: without any doubt, John, do you agree that, I mean, as far as, you know, what we have seen this prudent is the best guy in his weight with right arm. Of course. Yeah. He's been very impressive in his last, uh, three or four matches. So yeah, no, he's, he's clearly, he's clearly the heavyweight champion. Yeah. And, and do Devon, do you see this? I mean, as an opportunity that like to change and then people
Engin Terzi: will finally say hey listen you know i went you know in a bit the very very best guy you know i mean when you when you lost against uh levan it was super heavyweight title talking about a guy that was minimum minimum
Engin Terzi: 50 kilo heavier than you. I mean, when you push your weight, there is no excuse. Either you win or you don't say the guy was heavier. It's unlimited. But you know, we know that your natural weight is around 260 to 65. And then now you are pulling very near to your natural weight and then beating the very best. This guy is accepted. I can say that by the 98% of the community that this is the best guy in the world. So going to Istanbul,
Devon Larratt: And beating this guy is like something other than winning heavyweight title just to, you know, just so some people will quit talking about, you know, that, you know what I mean? People will never stop talking, okay? This will be a false expectation. I could beat Evgeny, I could beat whoever, and people will always find ways to criticize.
Devon Larratt: And that's fine. I don't really care that Evgeny is European. I just think that he is the heavyweight champion. I've always tried to shoot as high as I can.
Devon Larratt: You know, if the guys and if the champ is a North American, well, then the champ is a North American. If the champ is a European, then he's a European. And I know that a lot of Europeans have felt like they've missed out on the party and they've been like, oh, why don't you come? Your party hasn't been any good. Finally, now the party's getting good, getting good over there. So, yeah, you'll see a lot more of me. Yeah. One by one, the Europeans will fall one by one.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. So you're going to start with Prudnik. And if you beat Prudnik, do you plan to pull, like, I will tell you something, not if you beat, but if Prudnik beats you, Prudnik, if you beat Devon, and this is in fact, you know, not an excuse, you know, some Devon haters also say like, excuse this and this, but everything that he's saying, fact, I mean, at least,
Engin Terzi: he cannot do about injuries or something. After pulling 30 years, that's something that happens to everyone. He cannot change this, but he can at least prepare longer time. So if you beat him, will you give him another chance to prepare well and pull against you again? Or you're gonna say that I beat you, I don't want more of you? I don't know. If it's like me,
Evgeny Prudnik: it's love me in the fight yes i want to repeat it if what if it's love like me during the fight like process what do you mean love no i mean like like if i like this process beat devon if i like this process
Engin Terzi: okay okay just tell me examples how in which way you would you know give him another chance in which way you wouldn't give yes i give him chance oh you would give him another chance it's like if it's like me i don't know like me i love me i don't understand what you're saying but i mean wow oh man anyway so and and devon
Devon Larratt: question i i know you are not coming here to uh lose you coming here 100 to win and i can see that i mean you are sure of yourself but this is live if something like that happens would you like to pull him again i don't like i do not like to predict the future at all uh i think that if the match uh is worthy if if it looks like if it was a close fight and
Devon Larratt: it's worthy of a rematch then yes of course a rematch but if he quit if he quit in round one i mean look at here's the thing and people look and i love my t-shirt list of excuses i love them but it's the truth this is the truth yeah i have not worked yeah that's right it's uh it's if it liked me or i am uh repeated
Evgeny Prudnik: But if I win, I mean, if I win this time... If I win and end it like me, I give you a chance.
Devon Larratt: yeah that's nice that's that is nice but listen if i win i would give you a chance but i think probably if i beat you now it's probably not a good idea probably not i mean we can talk about it but i like a challenge myself i like a challenge i agree with you in fact you know if you beat protnik right now
Engin Terzi: And if you have longer time to prepare, I don't know that Prudnik do something while you are even more prepared. But interesting thing is, whenever I chat with Pataching, Pataching said that Devon is going to win this time and Prudnik will learn how to beat Devon. Oh, stop it. No, it's not what I say. It is what Pataching says. And then he said that Prudnik is going to learn, find out how to beat Devon and he's going to beat him.
Devon Larratt: next time and i said i mean will prudnik be the only guy to learn from this match they're not gonna learn anything you know and and he this is his opinion you know maybe we will become rivals maybe we will this is the beginning of our relationship and we will see we will see um but look at i i'll tell you uh i have way more respect for uh
Devon Larratt: even gay than the polls have. I'm just looking, I open up my computer and nobody, nobody's staking you. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody thinks you're going to win against an old man, an old broken guy coming in off of a world tour. I want to say
Devon Larratt: I want to say another variant. In this time I will win, but the next time I will win too. This variant, same. It's true. You hear that? Now, let me warn you though, Evgeny, let me warn you. One of the most painful things is to feel the loss from your fans. It's very painful.
Devon Larratt: okay so be cautious if you encourage your fans to support you and you lose that pain will haunt you okay so be careful be careful with what you encourage your fans to do and not do i would tell your fans to support you that's what i would do but i want you to be careful just from one older athlete to a younger man i'd say be cautious
Devon Larratt: John, what do you think about all this? I mean, is this what you expected? Oh, yeah. No, the banter back and forth, the kidding. And yeah, this is what I expected. But in all seriousness, this is this is going to be an exciting
Devon Larratt: close match. And I think both of these guys respect each other enough to to to be as much of a cheater as they possibly can be. So I am expecting some some definite fire and some arguments and some fighting and then the referees are going to be pulling their hair out. And yeah, it's going to be it's going to be great from beginning to end.
Devon Larratt: And I'm just, you know, hoping because I just wanted to, you know, just have it be interesting that Evgeny can figure it out and, you know, at least steal a round or two. It's going to be a disappointment to me if he just gets stolen while the first match, but. Look, look, look. I have a question for you. You know what Devon does when he controls his opponents? You know what he does?
Evgeny Prudnik: He waits, he talks, and he makes you to pin your own self. To think such a possibility, does it scare you? No. I will win in any way. If he can stop me, I will find a case for him during the fight.
Evgeny Prudnik: and win i find him weak point and win him if i can't find weak point i will stay many hours stay with open wrist one day two day three days and after he uh gets the one fall
Evgeny Prudnik: and around around and again we will stay one day two day three day before he uh you hear that john three days and after one fall and after we will stay uh still um
Devon Larratt: I don't know when Devon will stay older grandfather. I mean, to be quite honest, I don't know what Evgeny's endurance is like. He's never really had to be tested as far as that goes of fighting until one day, two days, three days.
Engin Terzi: had he had one match with uh when he was like 20 years old or something he had a match with pascal he was like 10 minutes 10 minutes we will say we will stay uh before uh we will stay when devon became grandfather i i have a question though on this same theme evgeny let's just say some wild proposals
Devon Larratt: If the match does stop, let's just say it does stop, and you somehow sense, maybe it creeps in somehow that you might feel like you're in trouble, will you be smart enough to quit or will you die on your shield? I will die. You will die? Excellent.
Devon Larratt: excellent choice i commend that choice yes yes and you know um that is the sign of a of a great fighter you know and uh it will be my honor to take everything from you that's why i'm there really it will you will become part of my cosmic punch evgeny
Devon Larratt: i'll have more for my next opponent because you give me everything makes me happy because it's so unfulfilling when the person just quit it really is you know i i prefer it when you give me everything i like it much better and and prudny um do you expect a war like this or do you plan to beat him quickly you think you will have power to beat him quickly
Evgeny Prudnik: I have five plants and six in like improvise. Six. What's six? Five plants. One, two, three, four, five, and six. It's like for...
Engin Terzi: somewhere feel what i feel experience exprompt okay there is a there is a question ask devon to make a bet on arm bets or what round his bicep will tear off the bone my bicep is already torn off the bone there's nothing left i don't need a bicep to arm wrestle apparently
Engin Terzi: that's another one for the shirt i don't need a budget i think you are probably you have the most number of supporters in this community and probably you also have the most number of haters this is what i understand from this the haters are actually my biggest supporters that's the thing
Devon Larratt: the people who hate me they actually don't know they're not actually psychologically mature enough to understand that it's actually love okay big grow goals john what did devon feel like in arizona a few weeks ago
Devon Larratt: Uh, he's he's got some, I don't know, tendon transplants and muscle transplants, and I know he's got all kinds of weird stuff going on. He's definitely wasn't the same. Same hand and arm that I felt in the past, so he's got some extra stuff going on right now. I don't know if it's leftover from Lavon training or what, but he's, uh, yeah, Afghani is going to be pulling the best Evan that I've I've ever seen so.
Devon Larratt: Wow. Guys, I'm leaving, guys. But thanks, Ingen, for asking me to be. Thank you. Thank you for being part of, John. Thank you. Thank you. You added a lot. You're going to be a great match. Evgeny, you've got chances, dude. Justin be confident. Devon. Devon, Devon, you already know I've got all the confidence in the world for you. You know, that's where my money's going. That's why there's no money being bet on Evgeny. All right, guys.
Engin Terzi: see you later thank you people are asking to uh uh invite hermes but i i don't want you know it will be too much for you to have two eastern europeans at once so i'm not gonna invite so 217. john is the god devon is the people's champion evgeny is the future this is what he said and

He says Devon is so insecure. He tried to get 30 stem cells injections in Mexico. Doctor only let him have like 13.
Devon Larratt: Evgeny 1,000 injections will not help him. Actually, I have a new deal with stem cells. Because of my desperation, because of my insecurity, which I'm very open about, I will have so many stem cells sap to be. I'm sorry. Listen, this guy, he's crazy about me. This guy, this sap to be guy, he loves me so much.

I will bring people food. I will bring people water.
Devon Larratt: i will whisper in their ear i will assist in any way possible to dismantle the enemy i am part even before your match well we are individuals and a team i'm the last match unfortunately so that will limit some of my participation beforehand but in any way possible that i can i will be assisting yeah

Devon Larratt: i gotta i gotta leave soon i have very i have to i have to train i have to work out more you said you're one week you said i'm bored i'm gonna keep training i'm gonna do some pull-ups i'm gonna climb rope i'm gonna hit the punching bag and go build up a good sweat yeah okay i have to keep training okay okay okay
Engin Terzi: and devon i have a question what if this guy hooks you and can beat you easily in that point and he looks at you what are you gonna do like if he does the things that you know you do to other people um that's impossible it's only one guy who can do that and it's me it's all nobody does that to me again nobody
Devon Larratt: Is it because they are not strong enough or they are not talented enough? Both. Listen, there are people who can beat me, but nobody can do what I do. Nobody. Not Evagni. No. Listen, I would be so happy to be beaten in this way because it would be a complete victory.
Devon Larratt: This is the largest form of victory that you can have over someone is to make them submit. So if he could make me submit, I would be so deeply touched. I would be so deeply impressed. I just, I don't even consider this a possibility, but if he did it to me, oh my. What president you will become? What's that?
Devon Larratt: If he does, he will become WAF president. WAF president. Yeah. If you hold me and make me quit, I will stop everything and I will become WAF president. What? You will what? Yeah, let's do that. Let's do that. I don't know if they'd take me at this point, but I would have to become a respectful arm wrestler, wouldn't I?
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah this is what you said you said this is what you said and and two more questions black paul can prudnik meet petrenko at 115 kilo me yeah can you beat petrenko if both of you are 115 kilo if petrenko 152 yeah uh how weight uh now uh petrenka 105
Engin Terzi: 105. i think it will be very difficult also this guy is really really strong huh you're simple yeah yeah yeah it will be very difficult yeah several robles devon in what round are you going to look at the camera and say way way too strong i mean
Devon Larratt: i i mean i hope it's later because i'm looking for a good fight but i hope it's not round one i hope not that would be a bit disappointing that would be a bit i'm not afraid if it is not round one then it may not be round three either and i hope that it's i hope that it's interesting it would be much
Devon Larratt: It would be much better if it was an interesting fight. It would be much better if it's the way that some people think it will be, where he is stronger and faster. What's this guy doing to camera? Yeah, that's not the way. That's not the way. The way is you need to hold on here good and tight, not so much out.
Devon Larratt: You know, here's the crazy thing is you Europeans still don't know how to arm wrestle. You're very strong, but you still don't know how to arm wrestle, unfortunately. But I'll teach you. It's okay. It's okay. I'll show you how to become more desperate. This is probably the way. Probably more like that.
