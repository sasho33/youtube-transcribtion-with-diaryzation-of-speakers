Engin Terzi: i i win this is my level up yes yes yes they're on a very good athlete me need wins yeah this is big big test for you very big test yes yes yes big big test yeah yeah i i remember when you come to yalova my city in my gym about it remember
Engin Terzi: and then yes now we talk it was like when we talk it was beginning of the august and now uh november and now you are at the east versus west yeah yes yes yeah after three months amazing yeah yeah you never know what happens in this life yeah yes yes i don't know
Sergey Kalinichenko: This is my dream, my dream. And the beginning of the dream. Beginning of the dream. Yes, yes. I think we need two years and I up my level, but
Sergey Kalinichenko: but now i'm very good training i very good training i my training smart my training up level smart smart training yeah i understand but but i many years not good training i training biceps press gym this is not good arm race now level training specific yes
Engin Terzi: yes i understand hello hello hello how are you how are you can you the trans our translator didn't come yet can you ask him how we see you see um i think he's connecting with you again or audio audio
Engin Terzi: i don't see i don't see the runner yeah i think i think also oh yes hello guys that's good hello paulo how are you i'm good how are you guys good good good uh you know both of them one is your
Engin Terzi: originally countrymen and the other one you know georgie is i don't know from kazakhstan thank you my friend for asking the recovery is
Engin Terzi: I don't know how it's going. I need to train more because I'm so much focused on the competition right now. I don't know. I cannot train so well. So, Paolo, how have you been, my friend? I'm good. I'm good. Thank you. I've been training hard. That's good. I'm not organizing any competitions, so I have all the time in the world. Yeah, yeah. So, you did some bench presses and things like that, huh?
Engin Terzi: yeah i actually won the small local competition of the bench press what what was it 2 32. well that's good that's good very good um georgie doesn't have so much time he has only 30 minutes and he will leave so uh said he we spend more time for georgie a little bit more now because he will go and we can continue it's okay right sorry
Engin Terzi: can you ask uh georgie uh how is his shape what form he is in now i think that i saw his weight is about 122 or something same as sergey can you ask him
Paulo: Yes, Georgii, what shape are you in now, he asks, and what weight? He thinks you said 122, but re-asks. 123. 123. 123 kg. How's your shape? I don't know. Maybe from the old 80%. I don't know.
Paulo: He's saying it's a little hard to say, but from the old form, it's maybe 80 or 90%. It's hard to say. And does he think that it will be enough to beat Sergey? Do you think it will be enough to beat Sergey? We'll see.
Georgii Dzeranov: To be honest, I can't say anything about Sergey at all. Because I literally started following him. I saw a couple of videos with him fighting. It was about two months ago when I learned about armfighting. Before that, Sergey told me...
Georgii Dzeranov: This one is kind of negative. And why did I know him? Because he got an injury on the Golden Tour. I don't even have an idea what form Sergey will be in now. Will I have enough of my, conditionally, 80% of the maximum form or not? It's hard to say. I will do everything to have enough.
Sergey Kalinichenko: But we were already competing in the same category. When was that? When you beat Laletin for the first time. But then I lost to Laletin and we didn't make it.
Paulo: okay okay he's he's saying that it's uh very hard uh for him to analyze and answer it straight if it's gonna be enough because uh he only knew sergey because of his injury at the slaughter door and then he did not really follow him
Paulo: But for the last two months, when he already knew that it's going to be a super match, he started watching some videos and analyzing. And he doesn't know if it's going to be enough, but he will do everything to make sure that it's enough. And then they started talking about that they used to pull already in one class 100 kilos when Georgii first time won Vitaly Lalitin.
Engin Terzi: uh i'm not sure what they're referring to which which competition but i i stopped them because they need to translate so he's saying that he's about 80 or 90 and he doesn't know and but then then said he was 95 kilo category now he's in his 122 kilo so probably is much stronger right now compared to
Engin Terzi: what happened four years ago. This question to Sergey or to... No, just say my opinion, not the question, but generally. Okay. No, just if you can translate to both of them, you know, just like what I said. Are you talking about Sergey or about Georgii? Sergey. Sergey was 95 kilos. He broke his left arm. It's okay. Yes, he says that when you, Sergey, broke your arm, you were 95 kilos.
Sergey Kalinichenko: And now you are 122 kg? Yes, I was 103 kg at that time. 103 kg, okay. Yes, yes, yes. And he thinks you probably gained a lot of weight by physique and by strength, right? No, yes, I added a lot. Of course, weight gives you the opportunity to get a little stronger. But as we know, it doesn't work very well in the grid.
Sergey Kalinichenko: But in an armfight, when you have a minute and a half of rest, your strength doesn't always give you the opportunity to win, or rather, to bring the victory to the end. So you need to be very resilient. He's saying that he was one of three kilos at that Zloty tour. And he went down.
Paulo: And he's saying that, yes, he is much stronger now, but it's not necessary that it's going to lead to an easy win in a super match.
Paulo: In the regular tournament, yes, but in the Supermatch, when you have only one and a half minutes to rest, it may play a different role. When I was in the company in 2018, it was 105-kilo category, not 95. Yeah, 105 kilos, he was 105 kilos. 95, yeah, okay, I remember that. Okay, I understand. And before I invited...
Paulo: How long have you been inactive? 8-10 months.
Paulo: About 10 months, 8-10 months. He was resting for 8-10 months and then he started training again. Yeah, exactly. He started to train when you invited him and now he's training about 2-2.5 months. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Alex 1750. We found out it already. Thank you. Forget anymore. Anyway, so can you ask him? What is his goal? For the East versus West? Does he want to like continue with the unlimited class? Or if necessary, he can make 115 kilo category?
Engin Terzi: I'll start with you, Georgii. He asks the same question for both of you, only Georgii will answer first, and you, Silvio, will answer second.
Paulo: He asks, what goals and tasks do you have in East vs. West and what are your plans? And he asks, are you both going to stay in the super heavyweight or maybe you'll think about dropping to 115 kilos? Georgii. After all, most likely my task is... I want to gain weight.
Paulo: How much weight do you want to gain? I think at my height, 130-135 kg would be comfortable. 135 kg, okay. Seryoga, what about you?
Sergey Kalinichenko: Well, I have planned my preparation for about three years ahead. Another year I could be in the weight category if there were proposals in the 115th category.
Sergey Kalinichenko: I can easily stay in the weight of about 115 kg. It will not be difficult. But in a year it will be impossible, because my weight will already be, I plan to gain 128-130 kg, because I have a goal to go to the absolute. This is a little later. Okay, let me translate.
Paulo: engine yeah so georgie said that uh he's not planning to drop he wants to gain weight and uh he want to be in absolute class uh as of right now and he's planning to gain up to 135 kilos so he wants to put away here
Paulo: yes and uh sergey kalinichenko said that uh he already planned his training for next three years and uh first year if there will be some proposals he can stay in 115 kilos but after that he's planning to gain two and uh for the second year he's planning to be at 128 and that's going to be very hard to drop back again so okay okay so he wants to get bigger bigger bigger okay yes okay that's good that's good
Engin Terzi: um the spain i think says what is this we can't understand a single word yeah that is how it happens when non-english speaking and people when they are a guest here so they speak their own language sorry for we couldn't teach them english and then this is why we have pablo here and then he translates for us anyway so anyway so uh i understand and
Engin Terzi: So he judges his form by the waist that he's lifting or by the table time he's estimating, Paolo. Who, Georgii? Georgii or Sergey? This question to you. Georgii is the one that he said is 80 or 90 percent. Okay, okay. Georgii, he asks, how do you assess your form by the weights you lift in the gym or by some sparring with someone at the table?
Georgii Dzeranov: What do you have? Well, you say 80-90 percent, but how did you determine it? By the weight you lift or by some kind of sparring partner? Well, sparring partners, well, in principle, you know, most likely by weight. But the weights, as we all perfectly understand, are not always very debunking.
Georgii Dzeranov: not always works directly, but in addition to the fact that I now just work more for endurance and therefore I do not fight with such powerful guys all the time, let's say so, because, as Sergey said, it does not always work in a warfight,
Georgii Dzeranov: foreign
Paulo: yeah mostly he's uh relaying on his weights in a gym lifting weights uh but uh but not only he he doing some table times but he said he's not pulling full force with a big boys he's mostly working on his uh you know stamina and endurance
Engin Terzi: So mostly he rely on the lifting. Before he leaves, he has like 12 minutes. He said he can be here only for 30 minutes. So I want to ask him. I want to ask his opinions quickly, like who's going to win. Can you ask him Devon Larratt and Prudnik, who he thinks that he's going to win?
Georgii Dzeranov: Georgii asks your opinion. Prudnik and Larratt, who will win? I support, of course, still more for Prudnik, because I personally know him. But Larratt, if he presents his famous endurance and his king move,
Paulo: he's cheering for uh prudnik because he knows him personally but he thinks that uh if devon will bring to the table his uh famous king's move and uh endurance uh he have a chance but he still thinks that uh youngster will win yeah the the this this is allowed
Engin Terzi: This is not allowed. This Fumero spawn, this is okay. In neutral and losing position. But once this goes like this, in neutral and losing position, it's not allowed. But winning position, some people are confused. They say, hey, you do the same thing. You control the reserve. They don't understand the difference. You know, we need to explain to them what is the difference. And so I'm talking about the fans, you know, yeah. So it's not allowed. So he thinks that Prudnik has more chance.
Engin Terzi: And then if Devon goes under the table, then he can. But it's not allowed. It's a direct foul. He can do this open on top row. This is OK. But once he goes there without the warning, it's a foul. This is OK. This is not. Can you explain, Peter? Yeah.
Paulo: Yes, I will translate a little bit. He says that such a full Kings move is not allowed, that is, if it turns out that it is possible in parallel, but if it flies beyond the parallel, then it is forbidden in the losing position. Well, in the winning position, of course, it is possible. Therefore, he says that such a Kings move is not allowed.
Paulo: no it is not king's move it is desperation move i don't know how to translate desperation
Paulo: He says it's not completely a king's move, it's more like a search for salvation. I don't know how to translate it correctly. Search for salvation. Yes, yes. He speaks Turkish, I don't know.
Georgii Dzeranov: I want to ask him, Dave Chaffee and Ermes Gasparini. Dave Chaffee and Ermes Gasparini, who? I support Dave Chaffee because I respect his age and I think he is more universal than Ermes Gasparini.
Paulo: Cheering for Chaffee because of his experience and how he can pull everywhere, but... Yes, yes, Georgii? Chaffee. He was tough the last time. If he was in the same shape, he was tough, strong. Well, I'll say it from myself. I'm just following him a little bit. I'm in America. He's gaining weight. He gained a little more weight. He's better than he was. If he gained a little more weight, then...
Paulo: he thinks chafee and if he will bring their form that he used to brought the last time he thinks that chafee will win and uh i thought from myself because i'm looking you know from the inside and watching the guys a little bit here in the states i think chafee is gaining and still he will bring the better form that the last time you mean the better form than the latin match yes okay i understand
Paulo: anyway so um john bersing petrenko okay he says i think he's gonna win he is cheering for berserk but he thinks that petrenko will win
Paulo: Say again, sorry. He cheered for John? He cheered for John, but he thinks that Petrenko got it. He cheered for John because John is also his hero, as he is ours. Can you ask him? Yes, he is a legend. He is a legend, yes.
Engin Terzi: No, it's yeah, it's very, very legend. Does he think that he's only legend or he's the best ever? I'm just asking his perspective because I would like to know how he thinks. Yeah. Do you think he's just a legend or do you still think he's the best of all time? The thing is, there was no Levan before he was 40.
Paulo: You understand, Paolo? Yes. I'm not asking, like, who is the strongest ever, but who is the, like, God, you know, like, greatest? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. No doubt about it. The reason I'm asking is, like, I would like to know, because over here, around this,
Engin Terzi: Who do you think will win?
Paulo: Who Rivas did pull the last time? He does not remember who Rivas pulled last time. He pulled against Derek Smith.
Engin Terzi: I asked, I don't know, I offered this match, I don't know, but it was short, so short notice, and he was out of training for, like, as you said, a month, minimum six, seven months at that time, or maybe even more, or less. He fought with an American, with Derek Smith, from California, a big, tall, young guy. The strong left, I know this, Derek Smith. Yeah.
Georgii Dzeranov: well, all the same, Artem, he has already shown himself, despite the fact that he is my compatriot and a friend, even if so, although his last one, if his injuries have healed without problems, he should
Paulo: Okay. He thinks that Artyom will not only relate it to the, you know, that they're from the same country and they're friends, but he thinks if Artyom took care of his injuries, he will take it. And does he think the same way about Ermes and Artyom Morozov? What do you think about Artyom and Ermes? Ermes has a weaker left than his right.
Paulo: He thinks that Ermes' left is not as good as his right. And Artyom's left is either equal to his right or maybe even a little bit better. So he thinks that Artyom will take it. I understand. And some other ones. Pauline and Sandris.
Paulo: sanders yeah uh pauline americans oh he thinks andres is gonna beat him yes okay okay okay i understand yeah
Paulo: And he said that 30 minutes, so it is almost finished in 30 minutes. So can you ask him, is he excited to come to Istanbul and take part of this event? What does he think about the general event? Are you happy that you are going to East vs. West? Do you like this event? What can you say about it?
Georgii Dzeranov: Well, of course, I will say that I like it. As Engin said before, although I know how it is, I will ask him, I will also answer. I like this event. It is very well organized, so to speak. It is done. Evgeny the very initial tournaments.
Georgii Dzeranov: i said i said pauline right i said i said matt mask
Engin Terzi: You said bowling and sandries. Okay, okay. I'm so tired. I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry, guys. I thought you were criticizing me for setting a bad match. I really need a good sleep. I wanted to ask you, I'm masking in the sandries. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Paulo: yeah uh i will ask in a second let him finish okay what do you think yeah uh yeah he said that he likes uh your event very much and uh he thinks that it's pretty well organized and even the very first events was organized very well and the farther is getting better and more interesting and uh yeah in the future he sees that that's it's it's it's the best uh best event
Paulo: Yes, thank you. Thank you, Georgii. Georgii, yes, he was wrong. It's not Pauline and Sandris fighting, it's Matt Mask and Sandris fighting. I was also surprised. Matt Mask too, I saw. Sandris... I don't even know. Well, it's going to be Matt Mask.
Engin Terzi: uh she thinks that matt mask may take it oh okay okay okay okay yeah yeah i understand anyways anyways please thank him and we are honored to have him and the last question what does he think about his match with bortolato with who bortolato
Paulo: With Bortolato, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
Georgii Dzeranov: But he is a very experienced and experienced player. And psychologically, he beats you with his screams, jumps and so on. With his earthquakes, in general. If I can do it... I've never fought such people before. I can't tell you how I'll behave. If he manages to scare me, he'll probably win.
Paulo: he thinks that he will win uh both of the matches uh but the comment about bartolato was uh like i never pull
Paulo: the uh people who making the earthquake right on the stage and uh that loud and expanded you know expansion and he said if i will not get scared of that probably i will win uh i will see you in either hook or top roll we will find the way oh okay okay i understand
Engin Terzi: I need to put an extra ball on the table, you know, so whenever he does that, we don't want to... Yeah, yeah. Anyways, and again, the last question. Does he think that his chances against Serhii is higher or Wagner is higher? This is the last question.
Paulo: Okay, he said, yeah, I don't want to hurt Sergey's feelings, but I think that his chances with Sergey is better than with Bortolato.
Sergey Kalinichenko: And before Georgii goes, what do you think about this? Sergey, what do you think about this? I think it's logical for Georgii to think that way, because Bortolato is heavier by 30 kg than he is, and he is an experienced athlete than I am.
Paulo: um yeah he's thinking that it's very logical to think that way because first of all bartolato is uh almost 30 kilos heavier and the second wall here is a very very experienced puller and he said if i would get the same question about bertalata and georgie i would answer the same way
Engin Terzi: he would say that Wagner would be harder of course if he would be pulling left arm yeah because Wagner's right arm is a little bit bigger than his left arm anyway so we don't want to take much time if he has time he can stay but if he needs to go it's okay you can you can ask him you know and then if he needs to go
Engin Terzi: Okay, okay, okay. Okay, that's good. That's good. Okay, that's good. Yeah. And you can you can ask him, you know, who can be the who can be the toughest opponent for him? That for him for Levan right now?
Georgii Dzeranov: Who do you think will be the most difficult opponent for Levan now? If Denis scores, then Denis. If at least there are some who can't do it, then we need to score as many as possible.
Paulo: He thinks that Denis, if he will be able to gain his best form, then Denis. And does he think that the best form of Denis could be the best of Levan?
Georgii Dzeranov: There is a reason to think so, because Denis had stronger opponents than Levan. This is probably Levan's fault. Maybe he is stronger, but Denis passed the test more.
Paulo: okay uh he he thinks that way because uh dennis used to have uh i don't know if how to properly translate it but make stronger or better opponents uh during his prime time and he been checked uh deeper than levan did so he thinks that early 2010s
Engin Terzi: The super heavyweight category was tougher than today's super heavyweight category? He thinks it was more, yeah. So it says that 10 years ago, the competition in super heavyweight was tougher than today. Yeah, he thinks so. Yeah, it's his...
Sergey Kalinichenko: And Serhii, what does Serhii think about this subject? Serhii, what do you think about this subject? I think that, for example, the same Chaffee is not much weaker than Levan, because I was at the fight, at the armfight of Chaffee and Levan with Ignashvili. I saw it all with my own eyes. And Levan is not so unreachable to me. That is, he is not so super strong. Really, then Chaffee,
Sergey Kalinichenko: Maybe 3-4% was not enough to win at least one match for Levan. I will not say that he won the whole match, all 6 rounds. But he had a chance to win one fight and he stopped it very well, kept it. I have never seen Levan put out so much that he felt bad.
Sergey Kalinichenko: He was sweating, he was waved with a towel and so on. That is, the guys are not far from Lebanon. You just need to believe that you can beat him. And that's it. Here 3-4% more than Chaffee will be than Adam and he can go to Lebanon.
Paulo: Okay, Sergey thinks that he saw the supermatch Levan and Chaffee, and he really thinks that there is not that big of the gap between the athletes and Levan, and he's not, you know, not that unachievable. So he thinks that Chaffee, if he will gain 3-4%, that would be a very close, almost equal match, because he saw how hard Levan was working, you know,
Paulo: uh to win the chafee and uh how chafee was stopping him and he said it's it's it's not impossible it's not impossible he's a human being and he's not that far so he thinks that the closest person to levan is now chafee
Sergey Kalinichenko: Well, in terms of strength, yes. Artem Morozov won against Chaffee not because he is stronger, but because he is more resilient. That's all. I don't think that Morozov would have fought better than Chaffee with Levan. But I think that Chaffee, if he adds more... I don't think Levan has been adding for a long time.
Sergey Kalinichenko: He always prepares the same form that he had. He makes the best form, but not level up. And Chaffee constantly adds a little bit. It can be seen that he progresses, raises more weights and so on. Therefore, I believe that Chaffee is the closest to defeating Levano.
Paulo: yeah he thinks that uh chief is the closest one to win levan uh because he thinks that levan is not progressing anymore he is bringing the same form every time which is very good form but it's the same form and he thinks that chief is uh progressing a little bit
Paulo: every time he's there. And he said about Artyom Morozov and Chaffee Supermatch, he said that, yes, Artyom won, but not because he's stronger than Chaffee, but because, you know, the endurance and stuff, the other factors, but not about strength and power. So, yes, he thinks that Chaffee is the closest opponent for Ljuban. And
Engin Terzi: But Levan himself thinks that he is 10 or 15% stronger than his top top 8 shape. Can you ask Sergey what does he think about his match against Di Cerno? What do you think about your match with Georgii? Well, I will say that my fight is the same as with Georgii. I fight with a hook and I fight with a hook. My right hand is multifaceted.
Sergey Kalinichenko: And I think the victory will be mine, because as hard and as stubborn as I train, I don't think anyone is training at the moment. And I can't doubt myself after such exhausting training and such a 100%. Therefore, I am sure that the victory will be mine.
Paulo: Uh, he's sure that, uh, the wind going to be for him. He said that, uh, he doesn't know anybody who is that much dedicated to training as himself. And, uh, he's, uh, his form is very good and he's ready. And he, you know, he's, he's sure that he's going to win. Plus he can pull anywhere the same as Georgii, uh, top or hook. Uh, so he thinks that, uh, because of his training dedication, he gonna win. And
Paulo: Georgii, do you have anything to say to this? He said, for sure, not in a hook. And Sergey, kind of agree, yeah, possible.
Sergey Kalinichenko: Our R-Fight will show, because I think that Georgii is the best who could be for me, for me to fight. And my victory over him will be like, I don't know, like a record, like a gold nimbus. He's just a very strong athlete, and he's much more titled than me.
Sergey Kalinichenko: He won the top in competitions and so on, so for me this is a very serious test. And I will give my all, 200%, in order to win my victory. Naturally, he will also fight for himself. I'll shorten it a little bit, because I don't remember everything.
Paulo: okay it's uh i'll make it a little shorter but uh he thinks that uh all the titles that georgie got and uh all the experience and he's uh probably the best opponent he can wish for uh but uh he will do 200 to win and uh he said uh i'm not sure if i can translate this completely right but he said that it will be uh shoot on his uh
Engin Terzi: a portfolio with the golden uh needles you know golden what golden uh uh golden needle it's like with you know that yeah i don't know his name will be written with yeah yeah okay okay yeah yeah with golden letters or something yes yes okay okay yeah i understand and can you ask ask one more time to design i know since he said he had a little bit more time and if if he somehow loses this match
Paulo: Will this hurt his motivation to come back for the future? No, it will definitely hurt.
Paulo: Okay, he said no, absolutely will not hurt. It's even probably motivate him more to continue and train and get better. Yeah, and tell him that as long as he has this mentality, he will be considered by us.
Paulo: You will always be on their list of athletes who they will invite. So be motivated. They will invite. It doesn't matter if you win or lose, but if you are motivated to train, they will always be happy to invite you. Thank you.
Georgii Dzeranov: Thank you.
Paulo: okay uh he said that uh he he did not gain even his peak what he brought before but he thought he think that that peak is not the maximum uh possible form he can gain a lifetime and he said it's very interesting for me to you know to get the big form and then to see if he can gain even more i will i will i will openly ask him what i was thinking he is considering
Engin Terzi: the super heavyweight category. And about two years ago, Arthur Morozov beat him right and left arm. And you said that he's considered in the super heavyweights. And since then, Arthur Morozov got even stronger. He's about 130, 135 kilo and much stronger because he is young. Does he, when he thinks about this weight, does he think it's a good idea to,
Engin Terzi: go to superior weight then then considering 115 kilo like staying at 120 and then a friday morning weigh-in for this versus west and then competing saturday night at 120 kilo i mean is it is it better and better or more so for him when i said all these things you understand my point
Paulo: He asks not only a question, but a question in general. He says, two years ago, you lost to Artyom Morozov in the left and right hand. Are you sure you want to gain weight and be in super heavyweight? Since Artyom is also progressing. Does it make sense? Or maybe it makes sense to stay at 120-120 kg?
Paulo: to drop the weight a little on the weighting on Friday and on Saturday again to be there 120 and still perform in the 115 category, where, in his opinion, it may be easier or more chances. Because, well, he believes that Artem is gaining, and he is already 135 kg now and continues to gain. Is there any sense for you to be in super heavy weights? I can't definitely answer this question, but
Georgii Dzeranov: Since I've only recently started doing it. But still, I would like to try myself in super heavyweight. Because if... In super heavyweight it will be more interesting, let's say.
Paulo: okay uh he's saying that uh he cannot answer this question for 100 for sure right now because he just uh doing his comeback basically but uh he said that uh it's uh much more interesting in his opinion to be uh in super heavyweights and he wants to try his super yeah so he is not intimidated he's ready to
Engin Terzi: try himself with the super heavyweight. He sounds pretty confident. Shoulders, everything is so wide, you know. He can be a very good super heavyweight, yes, for sure, you know. He says, your shoulders are so wide. You can be a very good super heavyweight. And, well, you need to train. Yes, you need to train.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he said, yeah, I need to train. Yeah. Anyway, so we don't want to take more of his time. And it has been almost one hour he has been with us. He said 30 minutes. If he wants, he can stay. But if he wants to go, I don't want to keep him busy because he said he didn't have time. He had things to do. And if he needs to go, tell him that we thank him so much. And we are honored to have him in East vs. West event.
Paulo: Thank you very much and welcome to East vs. West. They are happy that you will come and they don't want to keep you any longer. All the best. If you have time, you can stay, of course, but... I probably still can't show my full hand. I'll show it to you. Good luck. Dave a good rest.
Sergey Kalinichenko: He's going to train now. He's going to train now.
Engin Terzi: let the best win that's what they think yeah yeah yeah yeah okay now so somebody asked you before that there is a super chat for you furious is asking or not asking what's in his opinion thank you for your super chat
Engin Terzi: guys were younger but i don't think the best of each guy in today's period couldn't match levan in my opinion he on a whole new level he says anyway so where where does uh like how to say the first of all ask him the same question if he loses he has big dreams but if somehow he loses will it discourage him a lot
Paulo: Yes, I know that you have big dreams and plans, but if it happens that you lose, does it demotivate you?
Sergey Kalinichenko: I don't know if it's right or not, but I've lost a lot of things in my life. I've had serious injuries, I've broken my arms. And the stronger I am, the more the defeat or disbelief in me doesn't motivate anything in my life. If someone tells me that I can't do something, the stronger I am, the more motivated I am. But I don't know what can motivate me.
Sergey Kalinichenko: He has his own time. That's the plan. I've always been like this. I come to the Ukrainian Championship. If I lose, I have a year to become better in two rounds. I come and win.
Paulo: okay uh no he's saying absolutely not he said uh i've been losing a lot in my life and i've been injured and even broke the arm and uh nothing motivating me better than uh than i lost and he said even if i lost a ukrainian championship i have a year i'm coming back next year and i'm winning and uh it's a very good motivator for him the you know the lost
Sergey Kalinichenko: Yeah, but he doesn't need to lose, right? To get motivated. No, no, I don't need it, I don't need it. It's just that you always rise to a higher level, and there are guys waiting for you, who are ready to tear you apart. And it happens that
Paulo: yeah he's saying that uh you know every time uh you're leveling up you're facing better opponents uh but he said it's never been a problem for me never been a problem yep and can you ask him the same question he is 122 kilo but he said he has so much water
Engin Terzi: if necessary can he compete in 115 kilo i mean normally you can be 120 a little bit diet a little bit lose weight and the next day you are again 120 you know from friday morning to saturday evening you know would he consider the the heavyweight or does he also want to go to super heavyweight uh yeah we asked this question he answers but i'll ask again we asked you know
Paulo: no we asked him and he said uh that he planned his training for three years and the first year if there is a proposal proposition yes he willing to pull i thought i thought it was the zernov's answer no no oh okay okay this is the second answer zernov said that he wants to gain 235 kilos
Paulo: okay okay and sergey said that yes he planned his training for three years and he can pull the first year he can pull in 115 kgs okay and then then he's planning to be the second year about 128 kilos okay i misunderstood i thought that those was completely the answer of zero no i missed that part so so he's saying that in 2023
Paulo: Serhii will consider 115-kilo heavyweight matches, but after 2023, most likely, he will try heavier category. Let me re-ask, yes. That's what he said, but let me make sure that I'm right. Seryoga, yes, he re-asked, I explained. Yes, I got it. So, in 2023, you can fight at 115, if necessary.
Sergey Kalinichenko: And then you already understand the situation. The fact is that now I kept my weight. I haven't eaten anything sweet for the last two months. I haven't eaten after 6, carbohydrates. Because my weight has grown a lot. My weight was about 124.
Sergey Kalinichenko: I plan to keep my weight in the range of 120 kg, because this increase in weight will not give me the necessary strength. I need to get used to this weight, because I was 112 kg, and in 4 months I became 122 kg. I understand you.
Paulo: yeah he's saying that uh yeah he's trying to hold off on a weight gaining as of right now because he have to use to this weight because only a few months ago uh he was 112 kilos
Paulo: and he gained so fast up to well like 124 that he just not used to it and he's you know just getting tired of this much weight and uh now he's not eating like after six he doesn't he cut off on his sugar so it's not it's not growing that fast he wants to slowly quality yes yes he wants he wants to stay you know he doesn't want to pull a bit extra water
Engin Terzi: right right he wants he wants to stay with this weight a little bit to get used to it and then you know when he get used to it he can gain more okay uh let us uh ask him his opinions now and he's he knows all the pullers uh he is he is a friend with daniel prokopchuk and but what does he think about daniel versus samusha
Sergey Kalinichenko: What do you think about Daniel and Samushia? How much should Samushia weigh for the competition? 85 kilos. 85 kilos. And how much will Daniel weigh? I think Daniel is the best in his weight category.
Sergey Kalinichenko: That's why this is an ambiguous match. If Daniel adds weight, he will weigh about 80 kg, then I'm for Daniel. 10 kg is a lot for such a weight, for small weightlifters. That's why I think Daniel will win if he prepares a little more weight. And endurance won't help. You have to be strong.
Paulo: Okay. He thinks that if the weight gap will be smaller, if Daniel will gain weight and will be at about 80 kilos there, that Daniel will win. But he has to bring that weight in because of 10 kilo difference will be too much of the gap. No, Daniel was 75 kilos at the weigh-in. But on the competition day, he was already 77, 78.
Engin Terzi: And I asked Daniel how he's going to come to November 19. He said he will be around 82 kilo. There is definitely no difference. Okay. He said that then 100% Daniel will win. Oh, 82, 85, Daniel is going to win, he thinks? Yes, yes. Oh, it's interesting. Yesterday, Bozhidar also said the same thing. Wow.
Engin Terzi: let him get into the strap and he will win okay okay let's see anyway so uh does he know he probably doesn't know but adam morzinski and boshidash uh
Sergey Kalinichenko: God's gift, of course. I don't know much about Vorzhinsky. I can't judge him very much. But God's gift. I'm sure that the victory will be for God's gift. Because this guy lost the previous armfight. And he started to train much better. He started to do what he should.
Paulo: He thinks that Bozhidar will win. He doesn't really know much about Wawrzynski, but he said he saw a couple of matches, but yeah, he thinks Bozhidar will win after last lose in an arm fight. He's really, really into training. He's doing the right things now. Okay. And then let's go to Pauline versus Gamtenadze.
Engin Terzi: Pauline or Gamtenadze? I think Gamtenadze. Gamtenadze. Yes. I think Gamtenadze. I understand, yes. And Petrenko and Zurab? Left arm? Petrenko and Zurab. Petrenko. 6-0. 5-0. 5-0, yes. 5-0, okay. Okay, does he want to bet?
Engin Terzi: with me that the result will not be like that. Can you ask him? One second, one second. 50 bucks on Petrenko. That it will be 5-0?
Engin Terzi: Okay, I accept. And then send me $50 now, because this is best of five. The best it can be 3-0. So send me. I will send him my international bank account number after the show. He can directly transfer to me, because it's best of five. It cannot be 5-0. Rzod says, you can already send it, because it can't be 5-0, it can only be 3-0, because it's the best of five.
Sergey Kalinichenko: Petrenko will win. I don't know much about the left side, how strong it is. But I fought with Chen Xiao on the right. I don't know how he lost. Chen Xiao.
Paulo: okay uh no he's saying he doesn't know how uh how his left is but uh he doesn't know how chin show uh lost i mean he's like yeah okay i understand and so let's go revas versus morozov morozov morozov morozov is gonna be okay
Sergey Kalinichenko: Mindaugas versus Justin Bishop. Maybe Mindaugas. I can't say for sure. He cannot answer this one for sure. He doesn't know. I can't say. Mindaugas, probably.
Paulo: Well, I don't really follow these sportsmen, so I don't know in what form. He thinks Mindaugas. He thinks what? Mindaugas, right? How do you pronounce his name properly? Mindaugas. Mindaugas. Mindaugas. Mindaugas. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And Wagner versus Dzeranov?
Engin Terzi: wagner it's a lot of wagner wagner bortolato will win oh okay i don't know i don't think so and then serhii versus the sereno three zero kalinichenko okay okay and and so matt mask versus andres
Engin Terzi: Matt Mask is out. Matt Mask. Matt Mask will win? I think yes. I think Matt Mask. I don't think so. I win. I win. I win. Matt Mask win. I fight Matt Mask. Oh, okay. Okay. This is what he wants. Because originally when he came to Yalova, my city, this summer,
Engin Terzi: before the East vs. West 4, I asked him, would you pull with Matt Mask? And that is what he remembers. So that is why he wants to pull with Matt Mask. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's interesting. Yeah. And then... I really want Matt Mask. Yes. What? He remembers how you talked to him. He's saying, I want Matt Mask very much. And John Burzing and Petrenko? John and Petrenko. Who?
Sergey Kalinichenko: John fought very well against Kader Ghali. I will cheer for Petrenko. I think Petrenko will win 3-2. Youth will play its role. 3-2 Petrenko.
Paulo: he thinks that uh three two petrenko but uh it's very tough call because yeah he's he saw how he pulled uh and he's like uh i will cheer for petrenko but it's like three two you know only because he's younger oh okay so yeah i think he's also very strong guy yeah um uh
Engin Terzi: Ermes versus Morozov? Ermes and Morozov. Morozov. Morozov. And Dave Chaffee versus Ermes? Dave Chaffee. Dave Chaffee. Wow. And... If Dave Chaffee... They fight on the right, right? Dave Chaffee fights on the right.
Sergey Kalinichenko: If my friend wins RMS, then RMS will be in my top 1. Top 1 means that he is the best in the world?
Paulo: he said if that happens and ermes will win that uh he uh in his personal rating sergey's rating uh ermes will be the best opponent for lebanon oh yeah yeah that is that is also uh what dubai is planning to do it you know if
Paulo: They are planning to set, yeah. And the last match... Sorry, I will translate for Russian speaking. He says that this is what Dubai is planning to do, that if Ermes wins, they will try to make this match between Lebanon and Ermes. Well, if not Ermes, well, the Czech Republic just fought with Lebanon recently.
Engin Terzi: And I don't even know, if it's not Ermes, who should fight Levan. He's saying that, yeah, Chaffee just pulled Levan not too long ago, and if not Ermes, he said, I don't even know who's going to pull Levan, who's going to give him something. Yeah, but that time they didn't have a strap. When I had Levan as a guest, I said, Levan, when you pull Dave, you won the matches without the strap. And Dave tried to go with the strap, but he couldn't manage.
Engin Terzi: and you had a super match in Dubai against Devon and you accepted that if 30 seconds there is no grip in the direct strap, you accepted this rule. What if they offer you to pull Dave Chaffee with the same rules, would you accept? And Devon said, yes. And then I told this to Dave Chaffee and Dave Chaffee said, wow, it's good news.
Engin Terzi: because if you remember everyone wanted to see that match to go to strep somehow so i don't know if anything would change or wouldn't change but people still wanted to see that so but now as far as what i talked with them they both accept to start with strep okay uh yeah uh everybody want to see that
Paulo: Everyone wanted to see this match in the Strap between Chaffee and Levan. Chaffee tried.
Paulo: But he couldn't do it. And then, when he was already fighting Levan with Larratt, they signed that if 30 seconds doesn't work, then automatically strap. And Engin asked Levan, when he was a guest, he said, would you agree to exactly the same rules as Dave Chaffee? He says, yes, I agreed, no problem. And when Chaffee heard this, he says, very good news, you need to try. Yes, cool, yes.
Paulo: Sergey is saying that, yeah, it's maybe a game changer completely because, let's say, Daniel Prokopchuk, when it's out of strap, you can try to arm wrestle and pull with him. When he's in strap, he's unreal.
Paulo: so it's maybe a game changer yeah and evgeny prudnik versus devon larat but tell him to not to tell us any opinion with the patriotic feelings he said i'm afraid for prudnik to be honest
Sergey Kalinichenko: He said, I'm afraid to be honest. I just fought with Larratt a month ago. I fought with Larratt a month ago and he was very surprised. I just know Jacky's strength and Larratt was very surprised.
Sergey Kalinichenko: If there are no three rounds of touches, then oh, oh, oh, I don't even want to talk about it. Well, that is, if he doesn't hit his pillow in three rounds at once, the victory will be unreal. Well, you'll have to bite the victory with your teeth, because he's so strong in his position, so strong in his position that I couldn't even imagine that there, near the pillow,
Paulo: uh he's saying that he is a little nervous for uh prudnik uh and if it's not gonna be three uh flash pins then he he don't even know because he been pulling uh larat a month ago and he knows uh evgeny prudnik power
Paulo: and he's like it's unbelievable what that Devon can do this far from the pad and how strong is he in that his position so that's the opinion so at the beginning he said that he's afraid that Brutnik is gonna lose yes oh okay that's interesting that it's coming from his country man I talked with I talked with Brutnik I said are you stronger than
Engin Terzi: a month ago that you were he said yes i said are you gonna be this is private private chat not like you know he's not telling to everyone are you gonna beat devon he said yes i'm gonna beat him yeah let's see how it will be he will get him he will beat him what do you think we'll beat him
Paulo: okay before we go before we close let's let's go your your opinions you say devon versus britney britney is gonna win you're saying yes and which way you are seeing him beating devon uh i i i think it's gonna be a kind of straight arm flush pin to the bed um most likely devon will find a way to be in a strap yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: For the East versus West rules, if it is not parallel pin level, and if your elbow is on the pad, any slip is strapped. Yeah. Nothing like intentional slip or something. Yeah, I know. That's why I said that Devon will find a way to... I'm just reminding people, this rule has been there long before this event. Anyway, so how about Ermes versus Dave Chaffee?
Engin Terzi: They will win. They will win? Yes. And then Morozov versus Revaz? Morozov. Morozov. Morozov versus Ermes? I want to see that match. I don't know. 50-50. Yeah. I think Morozov. Because Morozov is hurt here. He cannot hook. So only weapon is going outside versus outside. Yes. Yes.
Paulo: So it will be the battle of the hand. Whose hand is stronger? Probably it's going to be a strap match, in my opinion. Yes. But yeah, it's very close, very close. I think Morozov may be slightly favorite, but it's very close.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I think Morozov has more horsepower to this way. While Ermes, I see more technical guy, you know, more technical guy. And back pressure, Ermes probably more. I mean, it's super close. I don't know. I don't know. With left arm, I don't know how close he is to his right arm. But I'm sure that his side pressure is nowhere near to his right. But he's still a very, very technical guy, you know. Anyway, so if we go to do...
Paulo: Another one, John Burzin Petrenko. I believe that John will find the key to Petrenko. It's going to be a tough one. Petrenko have a very, very good chance to win one or two, but overall John will win.
Engin Terzi: he will find his uh keys and ways to control the hand i i think i think in my opinion petrenko is the strongest opponent that john has faced at the east versus west when i say strongest i'm talking about generally yes but being so tall and so technical you know so he is he caused some technical problems to
Engin Terzi: john i don't think petrenko has the same tools but he has more horsepower this is my opinion uh i will agree uh with the guys uh if daniel will be there over 80 kilos then you will win oh it's interesting it's interesting yeah
Paulo: And Mindaugas versus Justin? I love Mindaugas. He will win. I pulled Mindaugas after pulling the Arnolds. I don't remember. Three years ago, probably. Yeah. It was a big surprise. He was, I don't know, 40 kilos lighter than me. 40 kilos? Only two weeks ago, before that match, I had a supermatch with him.
Engin Terzi: Okay, yeah, yeah. Only two or three weeks, maybe three weeks, yeah. In Istanbul, the three weeks, and I thought that he was going to lose it, but he beat everyone easily there as well, you know. Yeah. Anyway, so, and then how about your countryman match with Dzeranov?
Paulo: I want to see this match, and I'm dead serious. And I think Sergey will win. But do not relax. It's a very serious competitor, but he is not in his prime form. And that's giving Sergey right now his chance. But if Georgii will train for a year straight, I don't know.
Engin Terzi: I don't know, but Serhii will also go up in one year because Serhii is young. The Serenno is untrained and Serhii is young. So both will be going up in one year like this, in my opinion.
Paulo: Yes, and then Georgii will probably stop at his form that he used to have, or almost stop. And yeah, for sure, Sergey has all the time in the world to gain as much as he wants, basically. And then his match with Wagner, is Arnaud and Wagner? I think that Wagner will win.
Engin Terzi: You don't know Wagner's weight, right? He's 151 kilos now. Yes, I know. He's 332 pounds right now. Wagner will win. He will overpower him.
Paulo: I understand. For Wagner, to win Wagner, you have to be a devil. You have to be, you know, as smart as Pooler, where you can overthink him. Because Wagner is pretty much straightforward, one-move dude, but very powerful. So, and I'm not sure if Dzeranov have this ability to be, you know, sneaky. Yeah. And Petrenko-Zurab?
Engin Terzi: Petrenko will win. And Pauline Gamtenadze? I want to believe that Paul will win. I want to believe that. Yes. I want him to win. You want him to win, but I'm not asking what you want. I'm asking your prediction. Close? Very close. Anything can happen. You will not be surprised if either of them win.
Engin Terzi: I will not be surprised if any of them win. Yeah, I understand. Because I have the same feelings. It's just like big question mark. I can see Paul is hooking him and beating him. I can see Damten Azez stopping him and tiring him and then, you know, with a weird style. And then I can see both. But, you know, the last word will be said by the power, which we don't know exactly where they are.
Engin Terzi: uh pauline is very very powerful he's right relatively light but he's he's yeah he's very strong yeah and how do you see um adam morzinski and uh
Paulo: Bozhidar will win, but it will be a great experience for everybody to watch a new guy on the stage and it will be a big push of the experience for Adam and that dude have a bright future. You don't see Adam winning at all? No, not yet.
Engin Terzi: i don't know i think i think anything can happen with them i i really see that people says his endurance is crazy yes and i i want him to surprise us but uh probably in my opinion not yet i don't know i don't know i mean whenever these guys are how to say um like alone you know better than themselves i understand but whenever
Engin Terzi: someone like adam who has chad silvers behind him honestly and then he's adding a lot of knowledge a lot of you know experience and he's coming here as well chad silvers will be at this corner and yeah and i don't know i don't know that is not like a flash spinner guy except if the opponent is top rolling yes he can go direct side pressure
Engin Terzi: but but if the opponent has good hook usually bojidar having war and bojidar has incredible stamina but what i hear from people they say that this is the medium-sized they will not about stamina yes yes so i think that we are going to have a two minute long match you know but let's see who's most likely yeah and pauline versus sandries
Engin Terzi: pauline versus sundries they pull in court left see again i did the same thing i'm so tired i need to go to sleep sundries sundries will win sundries is gonna win yes i don't know that that match also confusing me six strong you know and then i know sundries is six strong as well yeah i don't know
Paulo: i'm not sure what's going on with matt but his late uh forms his brain to table is not is not what he usually is if it would be a 20 15 16 17 wal i would matt will win now he's in even better shape than that those years uh something is maybe
Engin Terzi: But something is not right lately. We'll see. We'll see. It's unstable. You know, each time is different for him. No, no. After he came here with terrible shape in May, you went back home with a little bit hurt honor after how Prudy behaved during the match. Yeah. So he said, he said, give me another chance. I will prove what I can do. I said, of course, as long as you take it seriously. I mean, of course. And people said, why you invite him? You know, he's done and things like that.
Engin Terzi: And then I said, no, no, no, no, no. He's going to come different. And then what I saw him against Krasimir, of course, Krasimir also lost against some guys, but this guy just won the Waffles as well. But the way that Matt won was very dominant. And the other thing, the size, the look that Matt has now, did you see the last video? He put it. And I'm like, oh, I mean, like, I don't know where to go. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: So, and Cobra and Haydar, you probably don't know about Haydar, because these are like legend matches. It is hard to know. They have been inactive for many years, and then they are coming... I saw Cobra pulling like six, seven months ago. I know, I know, but you know, they just go there and then pull, or it is not like, you know, he's serious. Yeah, I don't know. Cobra is very, very skinny right now. It's, oh my God, like a shade.
Engin Terzi: no no no no no right now he's 176 pounds oh he gained something okay yeah cobra cobra two months two and a half months he's training i i wanna think that cobra will win okay we will see we will see yeah we will see yeah yeah last last time last time i uh lost to cobra was in i believe 2008 and i was
Engin Terzi: probably 10 kilos heavier than him at the time oh you were also a middleweight guy probably no not middle yeah like 90 kilos well how do you call them welterweight or something you call yes anyway so and the last thing i will say how do you generally find the event level you asking me yeah this is the best event
Paulo: ever was present on the arena for sure uh what what what i want to see really much uh is a qualification uh tournament yeah i understand i understand it's hard i i know everything but that's that's what i would love to see it's just this is here yeah it's in my plans it's my plans i'm just trying to fit because every two months that we need to fit in january event most likely will be two days event
Engin Terzi: Most likely, but 21st, 22nd, I'm thinking, but I will think about it because if I put everything, then I'm going to have a brain bleeding. It is just kind of, you know, and then January event is only two months away. And then I want to even Ruslan Babayev is coming, you know, Ruslan Babayev is coming.
Engin Terzi: and it's going to be a huge event so but trust me that is part of my plan yeah and i'm gonna do my best i'm gonna as long as the community supports me i i will not um i will not let them down you know just i will i will do my best don't worry about yeah thank you for your positive words and hopefully we will see you here too hopefully you know just just get ready yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: very friendly guy and very positive and encouraging and thank you for your friendship also for helping and and and can you tell a sergey what are his last words before we finish and we will see him in a week
