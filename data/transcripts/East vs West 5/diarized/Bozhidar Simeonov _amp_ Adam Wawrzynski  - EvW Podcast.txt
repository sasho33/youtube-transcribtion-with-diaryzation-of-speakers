Engin Terzi: You good? Yeah. Yeah. Hello. How are you? How are you doing? It's all good. Good. Yeah. That's good. That's good. What was I going to say? Can you turn your phone sideways if possible? Like this? It's okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it will be bigger, bigger screen. Yeah. Yeah. So how is everything?
Engin Terzi: no it's all right i can't complain um so you went to uh juan sanchez hello hello you guys this is jake dean hello james hello ryan bones whatever um anyway so um you competed wow and then right after that you decided to go dubai you had uh
Bozhidar Simeonov: short so short notice i mean not the notice but but you didn't get any rest and go five days now are you recovered yet or i'm taking rest i i did few days in a row like working out training but it was just light and i was getting pumped really fast
Bozhidar Simeonov: but overall you healed up like your elbows everything is fine yeah yeah it's totally fine i will do like five six days more some preparation just not to get out of the condition but overall it was hard the first two days after yeah yeah yeah yeah okay hello to everyone um i i i connected to uh zoom i gave the link to bojidar
Engin Terzi: And then whenever I saw that Bozhidar was there, I started the live chat, supposed to start 12 minutes later. So now I realize that we still have 12 minutes. So it's your fault, Bozhidar. It's your fault. Anyway, so. Poor screen time. Yeah. So your weight is 85. I saw your numbers, information today. Yeah. Yeah, 85 kilo. Yeah, it's good. It's good.
Engin Terzi: and maybe i will go to three kilos more i have time yeah yeah yeah you're right you're right yeah but you were 85 at the buff how come you still didn't gain any because i have to be 85 in dubai as well yeah but from dubai today is probably 10 days right 10 days yeah is it yeah
Bozhidar Simeonov: I got a check. I didn't check the last time when I checked my weight, it was on the, in, in large gym. Oh, okay. Okay. I see. I see. And I have a question for you. What, what do you think about that? The Turkish guy that you put looks like he's the one that gave you the hardest time. Yeah. He's really strong. Yes. I,
Bozhidar Simeonov: Devon't know why, how he ran out of gas or what happened with him afterwards. I think after your match. After your match? Yeah. But did you know that the Europeans, he also beat Viorel? Yeah. Yes, yes, yes, yes. I remember. Yeah. I remember. Yes. I watched it. He was really strong, really impressed me. And when I attacked him, it's just my grip went down. And I continue more backwards, backwards and...
Bozhidar Simeonov: It was a nice match. You see a future with that guy? Yeah. If he improves his endurance and overall... That guy is a youth category guy. Yeah, he put on the Europeans also really good with Nedalin inside as well. He was really good. Oh, he gave a hard time to Nedalin inside? Yeah. He was really good. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Bozhidar Simeonov: I don't know. Let's see, let's see. And you think you will be 100%, right? After Waf and Dubai event? Sure. My right hand is okay. I'm planning even later to pull a little bit. And did you have any training after Dubai? For the last four days, I've been training like one hour a day, something like that. Justin for the condition to see how are my arms.
Bozhidar Simeonov: now you have 12 days and you're gonna push more yeah just a little bit just to get the condition like to bring back the endurance because i feel like i went a little bit down after two competitions and i hit some tough matches there yeah um this guy says that since bozidar lost in king of the table event he will be banned in indefinitely from waft no it's not
Engin Terzi: i mean what didn't ban the athletes buff said that they didn't want the the officials to attend because yeah they they they there was no ban for the athletes so that's why bojidar was allowed to compete so i yeah we had full permission me and del jacob to pull there yeah yeah i i heard that i heard that yeah and but people on the social media they spread it like you know you were not allowed or at least you were not allowed it wasn't true
Bozhidar Simeonov: they want some beef just they don't really understand yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway so it's good and are you planning to do any table time or just gonna do the just lifting i will i will pull today maybe we'll see a little bit but heavy heavy pulling with some strong guys i don't think so no yeah i just want to bring
Bozhidar Simeonov: I think I've put enough for the past competitions, so now I just need to keep the good condition. In fact, in WAF, except the match with the Turkish guy, as far as I remember, all of your matches were quick. Am I wrong or there was another match? There were no other hard matches.
Engin Terzi: let's see let's see let's uh in seven minutes adam adam will also join and then i can i can steal the pot if i can is adam joining what's that did adam quit or he will be late ah i think he's come no we are we are early already
Engin Terzi: mean we are we started 12 minutes before the time that we agreed so he still has seven minutes to join so yeah hello to everyone on the chat sorry for not being uh able to answer all of you because i have guests and so whenever i am alone you know i try to answer all of them but when i have guests you know i try to i read i still read you know and so
Engin Terzi: generally how do you find the card it's amazing it's like every card like every time it's getting better and better yeah and this is this is going to be going like i don't know it's gonna go down to history as like one of the best events yes and being part of it does it excite you to be part of it yeah not not just because of the matches but overall for the whole event it will be
Bozhidar Simeonov: like i don't know like the first time like that much arm wrestling will be at one place like all of the legends from the past from nowadays future stars like everything will be there yeah yeah and you are one of those people that have participated the very best east versus west yeah against tony kitowski yeah
Engin Terzi: And how many people do we have here from that event? The pool there, Matt Mask, Ermes, you, anyone else from that event? No. Probably no, right? No, no. The other matches were Todd Hutchings and Haji, Sarah and Irina, but no, no, it's just me and Matt. Joshua was there, there was Herman Stevens, Efe was there, I am Arthur Makaro.
Engin Terzi: Um, yeah, yeah. Only you, Ermes and Matt Mask are the ones that who pulled the very first East versus West and now in the East versus West five. Yeah. And the biggest one. Yeah. Let's see. Wow. And what do you think about your opponent? I want to ask you this, but I want to wait, wait for, um, he says, can you send me meeting ID? Um, why do I, I mean, um, one second.
Bozhidar Simeonov: what i'm thinking from where the this guy came from um
Engin Terzi: I don't know. Do you hear me? Yes, perfect. But do you see me? You don't see me, right? I see you. You see me? Okay. Turn the way around. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The only problem is he said that he needs...
Engin Terzi: I always send this way, but he says that, you know, it's not working, need an ID and password, he says. That's interesting. Password? The password is strength. Password is what? Strength for Bozo Wins. I don't know. I don't know. I need to send him a message.
Engin Terzi: I don't know how to. I don't know what to do. I mean, I didn't give you a password and meeting ID either, right?
Engin Terzi: no no there's no password we just need a pass code or try to resend in the link he says or maybe he should just write his name on that um let me let me try to send him the link again but um i don't know i don't know how
Engin Terzi: I don't know. Let's see. Let's see if we can answer or something. I got called and hopefully it will be a good event. And I mean, I think people see it's only me or what?
Engin Terzi: OK, I just I will remind him the the the password that you suggested. Yeah, I think it's good. Yeah, there he is. What's going on man? Turn the phone sideway here. I hope our match will go easier than him connecting. Yeah Adam, you hear us?
Engin Terzi: yes sir can you hear me yeah yeah nice to see you whenever you ask about the password and user id and suggested you tried the password what was it very funny he was asking about if you heard that one and that is how you were able to connect you know by the password
Adam Wawrzynski: oh yeah no fortunately i just had to uh copy the link and put it in a browser but uh i'll remember that for future meetings i hope your arm resting skills are better than your it skills we'll find out yeah we'll find out yeah nice to see you in person yes sir you as well congratulations on your uh waf world's win and your performance in dubai is very impressive thank you
Engin Terzi: yeah um how much do you know adam you made like your search research yes i watched him winning i watched him losing i don't like that we will end up in hook with him yeah that's what i was thinking that you're gonna have you know just that long hook battle which you usually manage to win but this guy people calls him
Engin Terzi: medium-sized larat about the endurance so and i don't know you may have a surprise there this is what i'm thinking yeah for sure i i feel like it will be one of those matches that i don't like some people enjoys the wars but you don't enjoy and you are known with your endurance and it's interesting
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I have some in stocks. I hope it will be better than last time because I want to win this one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And Adam, how many matches of Bozhidar have you seen? A ton? Well, I'd like to say that I've seen everything that's out there. Oh, okay. I've certainly done my research.
Adam Wawrzynski: Yes, I've seen everything that's out there, and man, extremely impressive. It's very hard for me to gauge exactly how strong you are because, I mean, some of the things I see, I'm like, wow, this guy's got some power. So I'm ready to feel it. I'm ready to feel for myself. But do you see his style is well-fitting for you?
Adam Wawrzynski: that, you know, that, that, that's been a, you know, well, uh, yes and no. Um, it really, you know, that style, it seems pretty cut and dry, but there's, to me, there's a lot of different ways you can do that in the setup, in the direction you go. And sometimes I feel very comfortable with people like that. And sometimes those people give me the most trouble. So it, um,
Adam Wawrzynski: You know, it's really going to be a game time thing. You know, whenever we grip up and and and ready go happens for the for match one when I kind of feel. You know exactly. I think I have a pretty good idea based on what I've seen, but then again, you know everything you have a plan until you get punched in the face so. Well, we'll see what happens. So you are you are careful, but you have your own game plan, but you are.
Adam Wawrzynski: ready for something serious yeah i mean i'm i'm very careful i've developed the game plan i'm sure you know he has to i mean you know that's what you do going into a match is develop a game plan but i would not be surprised to feel something different than what i'm expecting i mean 99 of the times
Engin Terzi: Bozhidar is more effective against top rollers than the hook rollers. And he is a hook roller. But his hook inability, like what I saw in Dubai, that happens like once every five years or something, you know. But the guy just had a waffle, you know, six days before that. Saturday, he pulled a waffle. And then next Friday, he pulled a Dubai. But, I mean, I'm not saying that Gachevsky is an incredible legend, you know.
Adam Wawrzynski: For me, one of the top five pound-for-pound best arm wrestlers in history. But this guy, I mean, mainly I think you like inside, right? You know, traditionally, yes. It seems that most of my matches end up there, and that's why I'm pretty comfortable in a hook is because, you know, whether I'm trying to top roll or hook,
Adam Wawrzynski: it just seems like matches end up inside and that's kind of home for me. So yeah, I'm comfortable there. I'm comfortable outside. I, you know, my defense, I'd like to think is pretty good. So wherever the match goes, you know, I'm prepared to defend it. No, what people told me, in fact, I don't know so much about you. I know I have seen videos and this, this, but what people tells me,
Engin Terzi: that I'm talking about the Americans that probably know about you more than I do. They say that this guy is not super fast, but once he controls the match, his endurance is incredible. And Bozhidar, usually, I have seen Bozhidar flashing people.
Engin Terzi: most of the times those guys are the top rollers because whenever you try to top rope and you get hooked you know you are i mean right but whenever if you have a good hook i have seen boys that are having long battles and boys are styled what i see i don't know where bush is planning to go but if he's doing if he's gonna do whatever he 95 percent of the times he does then i kind of see that your style he's not a flash spinner you know like he's
Engin Terzi: And your style and his style, I kind of see like we will see something like a long battle. And people talk about your endurance being incredible. And I know his endurance is also incredible. I mean, he's incredible, you know, by endurance. So I personally expect a war. And Bozhidar, how do you see the match? I love pulling in hook. I hate pulling in long hook matches.
Bozhidar Simeonov: agree yeah i like it's it will go inside for sure like i maybe i will try to top roll at some point but i think we will both end up inside at least the first two rounds we will be both inside yeah and that will be interesting to see you know whose entrance is better i remember you
Engin Terzi: beating Tony Kitowski almost easy whenever he tried to top roll you. But whenever he also went inside, you had some struggle with him. This is what I try to say, you know, that is, I mean, I think that beating you outside is not that easy, not that easy. I don't know. I don't know how it will be. And Adam, how is your shape? Like, can you say that
Adam Wawrzynski: you are in your best shape ever? Yes. I mean, when I anytime I take a big match like this, I do everything in my will to be the best shape I've ever been. You know, I've declined some matches even that I had scheduled in October just so that I could put everything I have into, you know, this East versus West match. I'm currently, you know, I'm a little bit
Adam Wawrzynski: dinged up from training but in a good way i feel like a lot is going to change in these next 10 to 12 days um regarding my state of readiness and uh come november 19th i will be in the best shape of my life yeah how old are you 25 so you're 25 my uh guess is that you are still picking
Engin Terzi: Yeah, of course. You know, I'm always... If you are 40 years old or something, you know, it is hard to go to your best shape ever. Still, picking is not that easy. But at this age, I think that that is one of the reasons that, you know, you still have more potential to get stronger. Yeah, I certainly see myself still on an incline. I mean, that's the goal is to always become a better version of you, you know, every day.
Adam Wawrzynski: You know, that's the, that's my number one. In the competitions in the USA, this is how you also see that every competition you compete, you are more like, like dominant. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I kind of, absolutely. I noticed that trend over time. I mean, it'll, whether it comes from, you know, winning my weight class and then winning the next one up and then competing in three classes and winning all three or, you know,
Engin Terzi: You know, just absolutely in general. And then, of course, just defeating greater opponents as time goes on. I definitely notice a trend of increase in my skill and capability. Yeah, this is my story, Bojda. I will be back to you. But people, a lot of people know you, Bojda. Of course, we're going to talk a lot with you as well. But I want people to know about Adam because they don't know.
Engin Terzi: They know this is 85-kilo world champion. Of course, the Americans know Adam, but this side of the world don't know much about. So Adam, one of the reason that I invited you, because I see that we have one big world. And for many years, East and West were divided.
Engin Terzi: call this event East versus West just to make good competition, but it is in fact, East and West, you know, we, we unite the arm wrestling world. And I want American arm wrestlers to have opportunity to prove themselves internationally instead of only in North America. So, I mean, I don't know how this match is gonna result,
Engin Terzi: I don't know. But even if you win or something, whatever, I want some new Americans to come to the international arena and represent their countries. And I kind of see that this is a good opportunity. And don't get me wrong. I'm not giving you opportunity. This is what you deserve. You understand? And we are honored to have you here. Yes, sir. Do you also see this as an opportunity? That's one of the reasons that you declined some of the matches?
Adam Wawrzynski: Yeah, I mean, when you gave me the opportunity and the call, I was extremely grateful. This is, you know, this type of platform to compete on, something that I have, you know, dreamed about and been working towards for a long time. And I just felt that it would be a disrespect to you, my opponent,
Engin Terzi: and myself to not give every single thing i have into this so that was my every athlete at your your caliber you know they really need to have a goal to become the best in the world you know they should not limit themselves only in their country you know of course i respect
Engin Terzi: whatever is happening in north america but the the we have a world which is bigger than russia bigger than america bigger than turkey bigger than kazakhstan bigger than georgia we all together make and i think that we all should just run after the biggest goal which is becoming the best best in the world and the legendary cobra rose the best top roller in the history uh he says england set in new standard levels
Engin Terzi: Thank you, brother. Thank you and be ready Cobra. We need to do YouTube YouTube chat this week, you know, and because time is coming close, my friend, I will I will contact you. And you and I dash and so most honestly, it's honestly, you know, you don't need to be so nice. You don't need to be anything you know, how do you see your senses?
Bozhidar Simeonov: it's unknown opponent like my chances i don't know i always bet on myself yeah you should you should you should you should but how do you feel inside of you you do you think that you may be in trouble or you think that with the experience with this and with that you know i i don't uh really know how good is my opponent you know because i see only the videos i don't know like
Bozhidar Simeonov: from how many years Adam is competing. I know him from this year. Like when you said we're doing this match with this guy, all I see is good hook, big hands. Like for sure, I will need to be really smart and really calm, patient, even the first rounds. I have to change a little bit my style probably.
Bozhidar Simeonov: not to end up in uncomfortable for me position, you know? I should be really careful even with the start, with setup, everything. Like, I don't know what power my opponent contains, right? Dave you heard of his name before I suggested? No, right? To be honest, no. You see that, Adam, you are like almost dominant around your category. Maybe there are a few guys that is, you know,
Engin Terzi: maybe better than you maybe not maybe at your level in your country and then you are not known over here and and many of the eastern athletes are not known in north america that is what i am trying to do i know i know a lot of uh american sportsmen but yeah it's just for first time
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm not saying that you don't know, but many people over here, we don't know. I'm not saying. Yeah. So this is good opportunity both for East and West to, you know, just meet and then, and, and Adam, how do you see your chances? Do you want to like, how are you coming here? Are you coming here? Like I'm going to go and win. Uh, yeah, of course. My, I mean, I'm not crossing the Atlantic ocean to lose. I can tell you that. Um,
Adam Wawrzynski: but with that being said i i am very fearful of you know bozidar's capabilities i mean i've seen like i said i've done my homework i've seen i've seen this man arm wrestle and like i said the level of strength is really the biggest unknown for me there's not a lot of net that i draw to determine exactly how strong i'm just expecting it's through the roof i mean the way i see you know he moves that spring hand
Adam Wawrzynski: Because I have one, you know, the way you, you know, just run through some of these people at WAF Worlds. I mean, it's very impressive. So, I mean, of course I come in with a winning mindset, but I believe that this is going to be the biggest test of my career without question. Yeah, so far, yeah. I mean, you are going to put against a world champion and this guy,
Engin Terzi: is now with right arm you are four times world champion yeah yeah 2017 2018 2019 second place 2020 pandemic there was no wars in 2021 2022 four times world champion yeah and and what is your weight now about 210 or a little bit more um it was actually a little less it was 208 yesterday morning and um a little less than 210.
Adam Wawrzynski: I pretty much keep it right there about 209. About 6 pounds loose. Yeah, I'm really not concerned about that at all. I could. I could lose that. In a sauna session or you know, a couple days watching my food. Yeah, the way in will be day before in the morning. Friday morning is the way in and then Saturday evening is the competition. Yeah, yeah, that helps out a lot. I don't.
Adam Wawrzynski: mean this is probably one of the easiest weight cuts i've done i mean i wouldn't even call it a cut i've cut to 198 before um it's i don't see that as much of a challenge and you you come in here with chad silvers right yes uh we got some sponsorship to have chad come along with me and i'm very grateful for that he's been an extremely
Engin Terzi: high level mentor to me, coach and friend, and to have him in my corner is going to be an honor. Do you know who Chad Silvers is? No. Chad Silvers is one of the American legends and multiple times world champion, world champion from early 90s and even late, late 80s. And he's going to come and be, he will be at the Adam Corner. And he is
Engin Terzi: trainer, probably I can say trainer. Yes, coach, mentor, all of the above. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And yeah, he's like one of the American legends. Yeah, he's coming. Yeah, I understand. So you are saying that you are not coming all the way here to lose, you know, so you're coming and you're going to bring the victory to U.S. And yeah,
Engin Terzi: Let's see, it will be good, you know, it will be good. I will take Engin in my corner. I mean, yeah, but I'm organized, remember. You can organize from my corner as well. Like we are already competing and organized everything. And then you should see on social media, oh, this guy is,
Engin Terzi: This guy hates the Americans, you know, you know, you know, there are a lot of, you know, people haters like that already, but I, I think I, I, one time coached you right against the Kazakh guy one time. Yeah. Yeah. It was good. Yeah. You, you, you ended up toppling him. It was like very, you know, he has big hands strong. He also can go outside.
Adam Wawrzynski: What you went to outside against? Who did you pull the right arm last time? The guy will tell it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember that one. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean honestly, my outside move is is pretty. It's not nearly as developed as my hook. I believe it is my weak spot is opponent opera me.
Engin Terzi: mine too so we can both go top row if you want the first round i don't know you i mean let's let's surprise the fans and go top row listen i i can't guarantee that i'm gonna try to hold on to you but sure um what i realized with your top roll i think you are going top roll if the guy just wants to go totally outside
Engin Terzi: And then if you cannot hook him, you don't continue to follow him. And then I see that, okay, you want to go there? I can also put an aid. And that is, I think you're securing yourself. Is it what I understand correct or no? Yeah, I tried to, um, I haven't always been successful at it. I've seen more success recently than I have in the past, but that being said,
Adam Wawrzynski: the past i've had zero success with that and now i'm seeing some so it's something i run in the gym a lot and at practice so i feel like it's coming along but it's not that that my top role is not what's getting me to east versus west definitely my hook so yeah it's your hook yeah i understand but but at least you have an outside skill to secure strap sure yes if the guy is going out
Adam Wawrzynski: I mean, you can also at least pronating go to strip and probably you would feel comfortable in the step or your hook setting. yeah the straps is one of those things that I need to have a good setup it's it sometimes I feel very, very comfortable in the strap.
Adam Wawrzynski: And other times I feel entirely screwed and I feel like the match has already won before the go for the opponent. So it's, it's, it's important for me to focus on a good strap setup. I understand. I understand. Yeah. As long as it's fair, I should say if it's fair, I'm fine. But if some people really know how to manipulate the strap and get high and no, no, no, no, no. We, we have, we have, we have here.
Engin Terzi: waffles it's very strict but we don't apply them so strict like when i say we apply them strictly to start but we try not to foul people just because of moving or something but we make sure that they start fair but in the real world you move a little bit it's foul foul you're out but if we be like that strict in this event people are not gonna watch this event so as long as
Engin Terzi: they don't start with any unfairness. We try not to foul, but we make sure that, hey, listen, you are doing this, don't do that, understand? Normally it's a foul, but we say, I'm not gonna give you a foul, but just start this, you understand? But we make sure that everything start fair and square. I don't think that Bozhidar has any kind of, that high level of outside skill. I don't know, maybe he has it, but I haven't seen him. I don't know.
Engin Terzi: Maybe with left arm, incredible outside skill. Right arm. We saw it with the left arm. No, I mean, come on, just because you lost, it doesn't mean that you don't have anyone. It was one of my, it was probably my best shape on the left hand. Like, no joke. And it has some little bit personal side, you know, that left arm match against Viorel Dobrin, that, you know, you guys had a super match and
Engin Terzi: This time you guys both wanted to win again. Am I wrong? Yeah. Like, we've been competing with each other since I entered the senior category. Yeah. And your left arm has always been going back and forth, while right arm you are dominant. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Everything will be fine. And people are asking, which events have you won, the biggest events that you won? Adam.
Adam Wawrzynski: um i mean tournaments or um super matches both your biggest wins are you can say about the opponent maybe yeah the biggest names that you have defeated um i throw i mean recently paul talbot
Adam Wawrzynski: Brent Rogers. I had a super match with Joe Fox way earlier this year. I have a win on Justin Bishop. I don't, you know, I like to say it was, was him when he may be not in his greatest shape. You know, I have a lot of wins and not super match wins, but tournament wins over some, a lot of super heavyweights in North America.
Adam Wawrzynski: You know, like Paul Passmore, Steve Walker, Travis Bajan. I beat him in Florida. I'm not going to let him live down that way. Lately, looks like everyone is reading Travis Bajan. Yeah, I don't feel, it's not something I feel too special about. No offense, Travis, but...
Engin Terzi: if it was 15 years ago or 20 years ago you would you should feel very special even five seven years ago you should feel very special but right now i think here's a free pass for many people you know yeah well he's also not training hard and he has a lot larger priorities so um it's understandable yeah but for sure you are uh how to say like
Engin Terzi: are improving you know every event every event people realizes that you know hey listen this guy is becoming more and more dangerous every event this is this is what i hear from people whenever i ask about you to them and they they were saying oh yes and this guy is very dangerous they said at 90 kilo you are you craig tuller and daniel mosier you know like maybe now maybe they were
Adam Wawrzynski: maybe rank higher, but when did you meet them last time? And do you think that you are in much better shape than last time you met them? Yeah, so Craig Tullier, I've actually never pulled him. Daniel Mosier, I saw once at Mississippi States in 2020. So yeah, two years ago, I'm trying to think when that was, November, it would have been exactly two years ago. And
Adam Wawrzynski: Yeah, I've been way, way better. I'm a much better arm wrestler now than I was two years ago. Daniel Mosher is one of those arm wrestlers that is very, very dangerous. And I'm not saying that I would beat him. But you would like to pull him at some point to see where you're at right now.
Adam Wawrzynski: Sure. I know that he, um, you know, he's going, he's still recovering from a wrist surgery, so probably need some time to, you know, make sure that that gets back a hundred percent. Um, but absolutely I'd be, I mean, I'd be honored to pull anybody of that caliber in the future. Um, you know, he's a really good guy too, and, and trains hard and does well, and I've really admired his success. So I understand you.
Adam Wawrzynski: when was your first competition first ever competition yeah uh january of 2015 15. okay almost eight years it's gonna be in three months it's gonna be eight eight years well eight years but my the first four years of my career i was playing college football so arm wrestling wasn't really
Adam Wawrzynski: I wasn't pursuing arm wrestling. When did the four years started and when did it end? So November, I'm sorry, September, August, September of 2015, I went to go football and I played college football really until about, you know, same time, 2018. And it was probably around.
Adam Wawrzynski: october of 2008 i was still involved with college football but i started to pursue arm wrestling that's when shortly after that in 2019 is when it kind of escalated for me so you are saying the last last three four years you are more focused on arm wrestling yes absolutely okay okay i understand i understand and and once you focus you saw the like very
Adam Wawrzynski: quick improvements probably yeah when i when i focused on arm wrestling i was i found a steady group with you know with i got hooked up with chad and um i kind of moved out of college and into a house with my own gym and and i focused arm wrestling full time and that's when i saw you know a big spike i understand i understand yeah the voice that is in trouble well that's for sure
Engin Terzi: Can you put the phone somewhere that is because making all time sound? Can you not leave it on table or somewhere? Yeah. Yeah, I'm working on my fingers. You know, sound like, you know, often that anyways, letter arms network here is to everyone buying the paper and sporting engine.
Engin Terzi: and all his efforts to support. Thank you very much. And thanks to everyone who supports the event. And so did you guys did you guys see this? This is
Engin Terzi: This is a high quality, it's not paper. It will be poster. This event is gonna go as one of the, gonna go down in history, like one of the best events. So we offer some, I'll say, T-shirts, and then now we offer the poster.
Engin Terzi: And the assets will sign this poster and and i'm going to give also one of this to you guys, so you can you can keep as a memory and yeah. So that's it, you can you can say that okay Adam especially saying that you know Okay, this is from the one of the biggest events in the history, where I beat the Bulgarian guy that was world champion four times with right arm. To the grandchildren. what's that to grandchildren or whatever you know just because.
Engin Terzi: After 30 years. Yeah, I mean, he can already be proud and show to his friends and family and everything after he beats you. Yeah. You don't get provoked? With left hand or with right? Right arm is going to beat you. Can he not? Can he not? We'll see.
Engin Terzi: i'm gonna be at your corner and give you wrong directions don't worry about it just top row yeah yeah yeah yeah i will tell you no i will tell you to go dead dead this shoulder pressure anyway so 217 thank you for your super chat buy this paper everyone best card in a long time maybe ever thank you my friend thank you to 217 yeah
Adam Wawrzynski: And generally, how do you find the card? Do you find the card exciting enough to be part of it? I mean, I feel extremely blessed to be on a card with some of the names that I mean, then you then you threw Devon on there with Prudnik. And that just was like when you didn't think it could get any better. It just got better. So, yeah. And then your special guest to, you know, LeVon and Dennis.
Adam Wawrzynski: i i mean i could i don't think i can think of a better card ever that has happened that is one of your uh best decisions to accept the offer yes i was accepting the offer it didn't matter how inconvenient it was in my life for with anything i i
Engin Terzi: That event just became a priority whenever you offered it to me. I really hope, no matter, I'm just joking. He knows that I'm joking. Otherwise, I wouldn't joke because we are friends. But no matter, the result is continue hard work. Evgeny if you beat him, I'm going to tell honestly. I see them this match 50-50, really. Because, I mean, you are a little bit bigger.
Engin Terzi: and I know how powerful you are and your Andrews, and I look at the style, I'm sure it is going to be a war, my opinion. And, but after, because it's not possible to beat this guy easy either. And then he's not a flash spinner. I'm sure that you're going to have a stop on him. And then I just can't guess, you know, who has better Andrews. I have no idea, but I'm sure it is going to be a war, but no matter what the result is, please,
Engin Terzi: continue improving because you are one of the hopes for North America. You are a young guy. Many of the other guys are older guys, many of them. I'm not saying all of them, but you are a young guy and you really give hopes and then please don't give up. You know, even you win,
Engin Terzi: continue even somehow you lose, I'm sure you're not coming to lose at all. And, but just continue, please continue. And I personally will have my eyes on you no matter what, you know, just because we need, we need, we need new names to be successful internationally from the West. The men of those guys that we invite, Rambat, John Bersink, Pat Achings, Michael Todd, Jerry Cadaret, Devon,
Engin Terzi: I have utmost respect. Those are all legends, incredible guys. But I don't think that the whole North America for the future can, I mean, put their hopes on them forever. So there needs to be some people coming from bottom to the top. And also, in my opinion, there are some people
Engin Terzi: And you are one of them. So I want you to feel that responsibility, not only as only Adam Wojcicki. I don't know if I'm pronouncing your name correct or not, but it's fine. Yeah. And then someone, you know, is representing USA in the West. Justin feel that responsibility. But it's just opinion. Of course, you make your own decisions in your life. Well, thank you. I certainly will. You know, I don't ever plan to stop working hard. That's something that is instilled in, though.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, just know that your credit over here is not for one time. If you win, of course, it's all the credits. But even if somehow you lose, I shouldn't talk that way. But you have the credit. Justin remember that one. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, you deserve it, my friend. And Bozhidar, you said you're watching this guy. What are you analyzing?
Engin Terzi: about him like how how do you see you know what do you think about him like if i didn't know anything about adam warzynski and you said you have a super match with him and then like i saw who is this guy and then tell me like how is he and then how what would you say you tell me you brought him as my opponent what you you brought him as my opponent you tell me about what is your own
Bozhidar Simeonov: opinion after i keep i keep watching this video like of uh his i don't know if it's a recent or like of him losing in long hook match so that gives me some hope this could be one of the long hook matches i have long i have won because i lost most of my long matches you know
Engin Terzi: So this is not going to be one of the longest hook matches that you lose, but you win? Yeah, I hope. I'm coming to make a point. I start to win long hook matches. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the question, because you don't know about him, but do you see him as dangerous as Samushia or little level below?
Bozhidar Simeonov: Yes, of course, I take it seriously even more now. Because after the loss from Samushia, I can't handle another loss like a hook match. It will be too much. You don't want to go to the losing stage? Last week, Svetan took my wrist, so now to lose a hook match, it will be too much. I will have to end up my career. No, no, no. Your credit is also...
Engin Terzi: Maybe you would a little bit rest, but your credit is also big. We don't forget everything you do just because of a loser too. I don't know. I'm excited. And also, do you also feel excited to be part of it? Yes. Yeah. And let's talk a little bit about the event. Adam, are you familiar with all the guys from East versus West or only mostly the American guys?
Engin Terzi: I'm sorry, what was the question? Like all those guys in the East versus West card, and like most of them, you have opinion about them, even the Eastern guys? Yeah, most of the matches, yes. Most of them? Yeah. What's your favorite match there between all of them? I think...
Adam Wawrzynski: That's tough to call. I actually really am excited about the Devon and you have getting match. Uhm? I love to watch John Bersink pool so. I was actually the match I was most excited about was the Jerry match, and that's because I've gotten the opportunity to practice with. And you know, made that connection with him and I've always loved Jerry Catarat,
Adam Wawrzynski: I was really excited about that, but I'm unfortunate to hear about his shoulder injury. So maybe either the John match or Devon matches is my favorite. Dave you been following the back and forth on social media between Devon and Brutnik, the singing and just teasing each other or not? I mean, I've seen it, but I'm going to be honest with you. I'm not a social media guy. I don't get caught up in all of the chatter that goes around.
Engin Terzi: I'm pretty by the book and down to business. You want to do the job, huh? Yeah, talk is cheap. I don't like to talk. But if you're talking, walk at the same time. Like Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali was talking and doing the job as well. Devon talks most of the time. He also does very well, except
Adam Wawrzynski: some of those monsters like denis and levon um you know i understand it but i don't think there's anything humble about talking and walking at the same time just walk just walk okay you are that's that's the type that you you are okay and i'm not i've certainly you know i've gotten heated in the moment and have talked and um
Engin Terzi: know you might see the look on my face and some of the matches and that might be the all the talking i need to do but i make it a point to talk no i understand but if you look at the reality if you want to make the sport the sport bigger you know arm wrestling bigger that sometimes like like we had uh do you ever watch ufc yeah like like that that hobby versus
Engin Terzi: McGregor match, you know, what, what, what makes McGregor is just also that, that kind of that story behind the matches. So, I mean, I understand your point. I am also a purist arm wrestling. I have never been part of these things before, but I realized that people also likes to have a story behind those matches. Some of them maybe just to hype the event, but there are some things that really have some.
Engin Terzi: story behind behind and how do you see that match i'm not asking you who you support but you saw the prudnik's performance against morozov against matt mask against tatashins um i mean prudnik it's hard to see him losing but if he's gonna lose to anybody i think it's devin you know um i just get concerned with now
Engin Terzi: the elbow pads for this event are an inch larger in the front and the back, correct? No, not inch, not inch. One centimeter. Centimeter? One centimeter is less than half inch. Yeah, so it's a centimeter. It is one centimeter front and one centimeter back and one centimeter from sides. And referees didn't want to call fouls for elbows, but we get a lot of, you know, criticism. So we made the pads
Engin Terzi: want something bigger from from four sides of the pad but we are gonna call when the elbow somehow leaves the uh head but uh those that the smalls this small like you hit and then your elbow little bit jumps you know this we are not gonna go but any any elbow foul with the the gains advantage they will be called yeah
Adam Wawrzynski: Larger pad is going to, I mean, I know it's not much, but it's going to favor Devon a lot. I think, personally, I think Devon's going to find a way to pull it off. He's going to expose some weakness, some angle. I am a little bit concerned about his shape. I don't know if he's in the, I mean. He's in very, very good shape. He didn't specifically, you know, specifically, he didn't train for this one.
Engin Terzi: But whatever, whoever he trains with, what they say is untouchable at the moment, especially not for someone like Levan, but around his weight, it looks untouchable. But this is what people says. And also Prudnik is in incredible shape. The Prudnik that we saw against Todd Hutchings was incredible. He was 107 kilo. Now he's 115 kilo.
Bozhidar Simeonov: So he is very near 20 pounds heavier than what we saw him against touching. So that guy is also super prepared, you know? Right. And how do you see that one? If Devon stops the match, he could win. Like we didn't see a lot of from a lot from their footage. But for me, it looks like Devon could stop him.
Bozhidar Simeonov: little bit but i don't know if he could manage to do this on the competition i know it will be a little bit like nerve-cracking match for me on the setup and everything i don't want to be referring this match i understand because both of the athletes they're fighting for their ground for every inch of sight of
Bozhidar Simeonov: their centre of everything, just to take a little bit of advantage. Those two athletes are maybe one of the guys who doesn't love to lose at all and who doesn't want to give an inch to the opponent. Maybe one of the biggest technicians in our sport. Both guys are well-rounded. Both are incredibly smart.
Engin Terzi: and technical i don't know what's gonna happen there you know because and normally Devon plays mind games but looks like we're gonna do i don't know if you follow at all but yeah now Devon is on the other side yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and yeah i don't know how it is going right now but uh i don't know i don't know and and like where would you bet if you would bet i would bet on
Bozhidar Simeonov: I don't know why. I just feel that he will be the winner. And who do you support? I support Devon, but I think Brunic will win. I don't know. So you don't support your fellow Eastern team member, but you support the Western team. Wow. Shame on you. As a puller, I just like Devon more. That's... I'm just joking. Anyway, so...
Engin Terzi: So let's go another match. I want to ask you, Adam, by percentage. I want you to give me your 100% honest opinion, please. Okay. Adam 55, Bozhidar 45.
Engin Terzi: yeah that's the good thing yeah i i don't like you 50 50 about 50 50. you should just go there to me even if you think it's 50 50 your mouth should say 55 45 45. yeah i mean i can't even i i can't say anything i i can't i'm not going to put anything other than winning in my mindset on yeah that's good that's good that's good yeah i see i see that the competitive nature
Bozhidar Simeonov: that you come in that way, that is great. And Bozhidar? 45, Bozhidar 55, Adam? I don't know. We'll see. On the table we'll show. You have no opinion about this much? No. I will just do like Adam now. I will make a screenshot or video recording of this conversation. I will put it on the TV in my toilet or something. And I will watch it every day.
Engin Terzi: Oh, about the prediction of Adam? Yeah. Okay. Good. It doesn't make sense. That's good. That's good. Yeah. And Brian Summerling, thank you for your super chat. And thanks for the card. I got to see Adam practice yesterday, and I am excited to watch Adam win. Thank you for your super chat, my friend. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Let's see how it will be. Let's go to another match. Do you see Daniel having a chance against Samushia? He said he will be 80 to 83 kilos. Bozhidar asks first. I would never put Daniel out of the fight. He can always prove and show. I believe Daniel will win.
Engin Terzi: yeah i believe wow that that's good it's good to hear and not that i have anything against david but right now this is the first prediction that i see during these chats that is somebody's favorite daniel even though he lost from uh the world so i still believe that daniel could win like
Engin Terzi: If he plays his cards and pulls like 100%, like Daniel... No, I'm sure he will do. I don't think he's going to come to... I don't think he's going to come here. But the only thing is he lost to Haydar Khan. But before that, he had a very long match with Mindaugas. And Mindaugas is an incredible top roller.
Engin Terzi: And I don't think that Samushia has the same type of top row. Does Samushia have Mindaugas's type of top row? No. No. So what I'm just saying is that match is going to be, you know, Daniel will be able to apply what he has. And he said he will be 82 kilo, 83 kilo. And it is like seven, eight kilo more than his WAF weight. Yeah. Yeah.
Bozhidar Simeonov: Wow, I would never have expected you to say that Daniel is going to win. Wow. In my eyes, he's the favorite. Like, it will be a really interesting match. Like, even last time, Samushia's endurance really impressed me because after the first round, my head was exploding and said, okay, fine. So, in fact, he should be even more. But he was better the other rounds.
Bozhidar Simeonov: I understand. But anyway, I see Daniel like very technical and endure in endurance point. He's really good as well. So yeah, this will be great match. Let's see. Adam, do you know these guys that we talk about? Yeah, I'm familiar. I'm really not so much familiar with Daniel more as I am with Davit. I see the match again.
Adam Wawrzynski: I don't know much about Daniel, but I see the match going in Samushia's favor. But what Daniel did with Corey Miller, I believe it was. The last event, yeah, August. Yeah, very. I mean, I know. Yeah, I'm very familiar with Corey and to see that that match went the way it did. Yeah, it means he's a bad dude. So I wouldn't be surprised if he won.
Engin Terzi: Oh, I understand. So you are saying that you don't know much about Daniel, but what he did gives you an idea that this guy may do something. Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so we go to do the next one. Quickly, we go and Pauline versus Gamtenadze. You know both guys? What is that, Gamtenadze, you know? Yes, yes. He has been competing a few years when I started armwrestling.
Engin Terzi: iraqi yeah he's like i have seen him more than 10 years at the europeans and wars the other day he was my guest and he said he has wins against many guys he said he beat jordan sonev he beat vitaly laletin he had beat alan makaev guleman as well as i remember one year he beat it as well oh okay yeah so this guy is very you know maybe a little bit style hopefully
Engin Terzi: yeah i don't know and how do you see that match and pauline is very tough guy as well you know if uh what will be their weight limit 95 kilo and pauline is already around there 95 96 and then i think uh gamtena needs to lose two or three kilos but he is also around there gamtena said he's in his best shape ever and pauline we saw against rambat he who can beat
Engin Terzi: uh rambet and he who can really cause some trouble to john that john had even you remember his arm was like his tornado was damaged became all red you know his forearm and i asked john you know did you go inside with him or he hooked you he said he hooked me and and he beat samusha as well and how do you see this match i think uh maybe if paul is that good so i think
Engin Terzi: he will take the first rounds. If he takes the first, maybe he will take first and second round, in my opinion, Paul. And maybe after, lrakli will beat him, I don't know. Yeah, that's interesting. When he pulled Paul against Samushia, he won the first round and then he lost the next two rounds. It was 2-1, Samushia was winning. And because he came from 1-0,
Engin Terzi: to one, I kind of thought that I think Paul was out of gas. And then what he did was he won the next two rounds and he won three, two. So all, I don't know. Interesting. It was, you know, what my point is. Yeah. And Adam. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not too familiar with the Rockley.
Adam Wawrzynski: But I got to go with my man Paul Linn. Paul is a warrior, trained super hard. You know, a nice guy, and I think he's going to bring the heat. And I support Paul Linn, and I believe he's going to come out with the victory. Paul Linn also talks very highly about you whenever I ask him. Paul's great. He's got a similar background to me as far as a football background. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: and training. I feel like we train pretty similarly. So yeah, I think he's going to pull it off. Yeah. And we have Cobra and Haydar, but these guys have been inactive for many years. And even people say that Cobra pulled last year and took fourth place. I think people think they're just going to compete in some events. It makes you active. For me, being active is just constantly
Engin Terzi: you know, pulling, you know, and or competing or training, you know. And so any any idea about that match? Do you know who Haider is? Probably don't know, right? I know him. Yeah. Yeah. You know him? Yeah. And we met also in Antalya. Yeah. He won the Grand Masters. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He trained. The guy has wins against Webkia, Sam Karadze and Kaczewski one time in
Engin Terzi: professional event and many guys, he has wins, you know, and three times senior WAP champion, three times. And do you see any opinion? Can you give any opinion? Because you haven't seen them much. Cobra, you know, of course. I want to say
Bozhidar Simeonov: who will have like the high ground, who will take the head control. This is, it will be interesting. And also like those guys to be back to have personal matches and the data type formats, that's great to see them back. Because competing in like WF rules tournament, it's different than a super match. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: somebody just called me and then because he called me yeah can you guys talk yes yeah i don't know somebody just called i put it to the busy but the the sound went down so much and i hardly hear yeah yeah and adam how do you see this match well i i really don't know much about
Adam Wawrzynski: Haydar, I'm sorry if I'm not pronouncing his name right. I don't know. I thought Cobra was retired and done, but he's coming back and I hope he's been training hard. I don't know. It's up in the air for me. I actually have no idea. I agree with Bozhidar. I'm excited to see who takes the high ground and who can get hand control, but
Adam Wawrzynski: I don't know. For me, it's up in the air. Looks like... Hey, I think Angel left. Yeah, I think... He probably had to take that call or something. Yeah, I don't know who's going to win that match. I would like to say Cobra, but I don't know when the last time he competed was, so I really have
Adam Wawrzynski: I mean, who I traditionally know, Cobra to be is extremely dangerous. And if he can bring any version, that version of him out, then I think it's no question, but you know, how, what he's in and what he's going to bring to the table.
Engin Terzi: is an unknown to me so with that being said i don't think he can bring the diversion that he used to be in his prime but i'm sure that he's gonna come as good as he can be after so many years of break two months training at the age of 58 you know let's see how much he can be but your your your coach chad silvers know a lot about him you know he does yes sir yeah yeah anyway so
Engin Terzi: another match let's let's go uh talks oh matt mask and sundries my favorite yeah and i i do you know how it is like a point comes i see sundries and i say okay this guy is gonna be mad and then i see something with matt no i think matt is gonna win and then this and that you know i'm like so confused both are in incredible shape you saw how good he was he beat
Engin Terzi: Gattalo in inside, you know, Alexander Gattalo in hook. And this guy is just now is in incredible shape, Sandris. And then we saw Matt Mask versus Krasimir. And then did you see the last video that Matt was moving his forearm? Yes, yes, yes. I was like, what the hell, you know, what is that, you know? And I was like, so I have no opinion about that match. Yeah. And yours? I'm really curious. It's my favorite match, what I want to see.
Bozhidar Simeonov: from the card like from the whole card this was it will show because i believe that mask is in top shape right now and it will show where is sundress right now in like overall in the community of arm wrestling it will be a more precise view and and it's very good match for me for sundance who do you think is gonna win
Engin Terzi: I personally support Sandris, but I don't know who will win. I think the last time when Matt came here in a bad shape and the way that Prudnik behaved during the match, in my opinion, it made the things personal for Matt. He, I think, went back in a mindset that I'm going to get into a super shape and I'm going to go back to that stage and I'm going to
Engin Terzi: prove myself. Maybe not right away against Broodnick, but I will go step by step and then I will show them what I can do. This is how I feel. And more I see Matt's shape, how he looks, how he performs, more I am almost sure that, you know, this is his match. This match switched him back to the dark side of farm racing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Adam? I, uh,
Adam Wawrzynski: tough one for me to call. I support Matt Mask, although I do believe it is slight favor of Sandris. I think maybe, I mean, when I say slight favor, 52-48, 51-49. Yeah, so close, but just give the edge. Are you a financial manager or something? What's your job? What's that?
Bozhidar Simeonov: Are you a financial manager or something? What is your day job? I'm an engineer. See? That's why you're throwing some random numbers. Yeah. That's just how I see it. It's a very slight 52, 48, 51, 49. See, he said that you are good at the numbers and
Engin Terzi: You want to remind him the numbers that you gave about your match? Then ask him if he still thinks that you are good at this. I didn't lie. Is he really that good? Yeah. We'll see. This time the calculations are right or he will go home just with Dennis' autograph. He will go home what?
Engin Terzi: With Tsiplenkov's autograph. Oh, okay, okay, yeah. I understand. Shane Bowen arm nursing. Adam will win 3-1. His power is insane. And his arm is too big. Sorry, Bozhidar. You are being set up for failure. My arm, my palm is small, so. Yeah, he said that you are set up for failure.
Adam Wawrzynski: so okay i need this to you just to make you lose sorry about it uh you can take your money for for your tickets i'm not coming after you're not coming okay i i will say this looking from an outside perspective i i i do believe you have the the edge i mean you're much more decorated than i am and
Adam Wawrzynski: I mean, there's some people over here that feel very strongly. I can win. And I mean, I feel that way too, but you know, if we had to go from, I mean, the 55, 45, that's my opinion, but if I had to put the bias out of it, I mean, you, you clearly have the edge and I think it's by more than that, probably 60, 40, you know, that's, that's. The typical will show like, we'll see.
Engin Terzi: Man, he said this way, table will show, we will see. It means that you are so inexperienced. You just come. I'm going to show you. We have like almost the same. Adam, this is a translation of what is actually, you know. You will see after two, three minutes after the goal, you will understand. Hey, Krasimir said that there has never been a hook match more than one minute long.
Engin Terzi: He says that he says that before one minute, one's wrist doesn't handle anymore and then his wrist goes back. And then I start to search. I said, are you sure there is no match like two minutes hook? And then I watch Revaz Serdekian and Batkiri Oniyani left arm match and really before one minute, one's wrist goes. And I check your match with Samushia before one minute, his wrist went back, you know, and I was like, wow.
Engin Terzi: I don't know if there is, like, is there any match that at least handles more than one minute and they both go hook and then finish in hook? There should be a match, but just the matches that I remember, whenever I checked, I saw that he was right. But there should be some matches maybe he didn't go as... Anyway, so let's go to the next one. We go Di Dzeranov and Wagner Bortolato with left arm.
Bozhidar Simeonov: Any opinion on that, Adam? I don't know. Yeah, I know Wagner a little bit, but again, I haven't seen him compete in a long time. I really have no valid opinion on that. And you, Bozhidar, you know both of them. I give DH fully to Dzeranov. I think he will take the wrist and finish. But if Wagner stops him with dead wrist,
Engin Terzi: It could be a good match. Did you see today when I asked in the group your sizes, numbers, age and everything? Did you see the weight of Wagner Bortolato there? No. It was 151 kilos. Yeah, that's good but... This is like 330... What? Two pounds? Yeah. Wow.
Bozhidar Simeonov: It's really impressive. Wagner is old school, but I know how strong Dzeranov's top row is. Did you know that Wagner is also four times world champion with left arm? With those guys like Gennady, Tokarev and many other guys with that. Yeah, but those guys are hook pullers. If Dzeranov goes and hooks, Wagner will wipe the floor. Tokarev can top roll as well, as far as I remember, but
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so I see. Let's see how it will be. So you are saying that he will be top-rolled, but you said that there is a chance that he may beat him like this. It's possible, but I don't see it happening. Yeah. And Adam, for sure you don't know Kalinichenko is? I don't. I don't. I understand. That's why I don't want to ask about those ones, because does Adam know Kalinichenko probably will be
Engin Terzi: very new thing for you but that that's one of the good thing that uh you will experience in istanbul that you will see these guys very closely at the stage yeah i think this is good opportunity for both east and west not only for the athletes but for the community to get to know each other and even even some people knows both sides but they don't know
Bozhidar Simeonov: how to compare them without them actually pulling. And Bozhidar, how do you see that one? I think if Sergey's wrist doesn't go, if he can maintain the wrist, he will win the match. I understand. And do you expect, okay, so you give the edge to Kalinichenko? I can't say, but I hope he will win because it's maybe...
Engin Terzi: It's his second Supermatch. I think he is more hungry to prove himself. He wants to win more. Another East vs. East match I will ask you. Petrenko and Zurab with left arm. Last time when they pulled, Petrenko won I think with left. They pulled the same year as Europeans and Worlds.
Bozhidar Simeonov: yeah and one time that twinkle yeah and how do you see i give the edge to zurab because i know petra it's petrenko's left arm is not as right and i think zura wasn't very happy with his last performances so
Bozhidar Simeonov: Right now, I give the edge to Zurab. Did you know that in 2019 Zloty, Petrenko beat Dadekian? Yes, with left and right. I think Petrenko will take the risk of Zurab and Zurab will press him. Not press, but push him. I understand. And Ermes versus Morozov, left arm, Adam?
Adam Wawrzynski: Morozov, and who's he pulling again? Ermes Gasparini. Left, yeah. I got to say Ermes. Do you think he's going to top roll him? Yeah, I think I'm giving the edge to Ermes there. I think in the...
Engin Terzi: in the process of top rolling him he's gonna pin him it may land in a hook but i don't think he's gonna be catch it in time i think morozov's hook is uh because his inner elbow is hurt if you if you remember uh ojeda in dubai he couldn't go the way he only had to go that way this is because he's hurt here but he's he can only top rope see if he was in this condition that he couldn't go hook he would probably lost against tobias on that day as well because
Engin Terzi: He tried to topple Tobias and he lost his wrist. And then he, remember, he started a bit spinated and he beat him in the hook. But now he's hurt here. So it looks like he doesn't have the option to go inside. So it will be an outside versus outside battle. How do you see that, Bozhidar? It will be interesting. Because it depends on Morozov's performance. Because sometimes he is not doing the right thing.
Bozhidar Simeonov: sometimes he's too slow but it depends i give the edge like it will be huge war i think hermes will take the first two rounds and after morozov will beat him so you are expecting not any three zero dominance no no no i give i i think it will end up something like three two for morozov and and uh how about
Adam Wawrzynski: Revaz versus Morozov, Adam. Do you follow these guys? Do you remember Revaz? A little, yes. He pulls against Michael and he pulls against Derek. Yeah, I think Revaz is going to win that match. Well, I mean, it's hard to say, though, because Morozov, I mean, to beat Dave Chaffee the way he did and...
Adam Wawrzynski: I think I still give the edge to Revis. Do you see him top rolling Morozov? Yeah, I think I see him staying high and applying a lot of power. Once he gets the height. But I wouldn't be surprised if Artem. Yeah, I would not be surprised if he caught him and was able to contain that match. It would not surprise me at all.
Bozhidar Simeonov: So you are saying that there is a possibility that he may even catch him in hook. And then once he gets hooked, you know, he can beat him. And Bozhidar, what's your opinion? I'm curious about it. Yours? I think Revaz will be dominant. As much as I like Morozov, I think that right now Revaz is in top three, like overall in the world. Yeah. I think now he is working out really hard. He is really well prepared.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Levan is also thinking he's one of the guys that, you know, have potential to be... Yeah, I do believe now that Rivas is one of the guys who should face Levan for the top spot. Yeah, one guy said that Rivas lost centre to Michael not long ago. Not sure he can make that many games so fast. But guys, remember, from 2018 to 2022,
Engin Terzi: Revaz quit armwrestling for years. And then I asked him if he would pull Michael, and he had two months when he started. And then he pulled, he trained two months, he came to Istanbul, he said he was in 40% shape. And then he pulled Derek Smith, he said he was at 60% shape. And now I ask him after three and a half months, because in August 6, he pulled, and now November 19, so it's three and a half months.
Engin Terzi: So he says he is now 80 percent. So it is hard to compare his shape in May to what's his shape going to be in November, which is about. Five, six, six and a half months, almost six months, exactly six months. What's the moral of the story? He should take some math classes from Adam.
Engin Terzi: because those numbers are crazy to say like this 60 percent so you know like five ten percent difference in arm wrestling is too much i agree but if you totally quit four years and then of course that you you are down so much and then then you can improve and this is the reason one of the reason that this guy says that he told me the engine i never took arm wrestling super seriously he said
Engin Terzi: I was competing, but not super seriously. He said the first time I'm so dedicated. And that is why I think that we have never seen best of Revaz till today.
Engin Terzi: so even when he saw him he was very good i don't think he was in like that dedicated to arm wrestling so this guy had potential you know he's near two meters his shoulders are that wide he's just like a huge man he's even bigger than bigger man than uh levan if you look at the genetic yeah but he is not that muscular and so even now he's about 145 feet or something looks like pure muscle you know
Engin Terzi: dangerous. And about Morozov Morozov is improving, like this is young, but he already pushes, pushes, pushes every day. I don't think he can make so like, you know, improvement, you understand, because he's, he's already pushing limits. So he's already, I'm sure he will get stronger, but he will take a little bit longer than two, three months, you know, let's see. Let's see. And you said you said, where was this gonna be? Right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: and then john john burzing petrenko and adam you are or you are polish origin i have a polish last name but i'm not very much oh okay okay you're anxious you know yeah uh it um i would i would be an eighth polish if you broke it down between when they came over and like the same same as john burzing you know john burzing is also the last name
Adam Wawrzynski: from there but he's probably american american american up to his grandfather's and father probably right yeah i'm a majority a lot of my family came over from italy and syria but not um oh polish too but not that was generations ago how did the last name ended up like that well my grandfather's my grandfather's mother was polish
Engin Terzi: Well, she was Polish and his father was Finnish, or I guess this father was Polish and mother was Finnish. And then that last name, you know, kept resonating. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I understand. Yeah. Because you kind of with your glasses and coolness and the table, you know, everything just reminds me, John. So I have hopes in you, you know, to reach.
Adam Wawrzynski: similar i don't think anyone will be like him but i mean it would be good if you can yeah yeah yeah and john brzing petrenko how do you see that adam i i will never bet against john brzing it's because you love him yes and i just you know his i it he's the greatest i mean even at you know the age he is now yeah
Adam Wawrzynski: his last match with hunger he was a little bit my understanding he may have been a little sick or under the weather the limit yeah um yeah it's hard for me to bet against john brzenk i think he's going to win that match yeah but are you objective with your opinion or is a lot of a lot of emotions are involved yeah a lot maybe too many emotions involved um
Adam Wawrzynski: But but I still don't think yeah, I don't think portray. I mean, even if I look at it from an unbiased view, I still don't think that. I just don't think portraying OK, pull it off. You don't think that Patrick has the skills to apply what he has? No, I think the only. Way that John Brzenk is going to lose in any of these matches is when he gets so old to the point where he can't. Use his.
Engin Terzi: hand and wrist the way he wants to. I think age at a certain time is what's going to stop him, but I don't... You are saying it's not this time? No. Not yet. And because Petrenko is not as skillful as Ongarbaev at the table. Petrenko is so strong, but John will be able to apply what he has. This is how I see the match. While Ongarbaev is a very dangerous guy, one of the most...
Engin Terzi: dangerous top roles in the world. Whenever I think of Petrenko, I see a very strong guy, but technically not so like mind-blowing guy, you know. And Bojira? Sorry. I think they will end up in hook and they will make long match. Who is winning there? I don't know. They're still pulling in my head.
Engin Terzi: and i asked you like about two minutes ago and adam having this conversation they are still pulling right yeah or was the setup was too long it's like patrico going this way brazilian stopping yeah i kind of i kind of think that john john will who's gonna hook who i think already you don't need to tell your opening you are seeing the match do you realize can you
Engin Terzi: rewind and then check who is who who is i think they will end up in strap and petrenko will hook john and john will counter him john will okay petrenko will go inside okay i understand yeah yeah let's see once john has this cup he's using his tornado so devil yeah and then we talked already about devon versus prudnik right okay now we have the match
Adam Wawrzynski: NMS Gasparini, Dave Chaffee. Go ahead, Adam. Dave Chaffee. What's that? Dave Chaffee. Yeah. And how much objective are you? How much American now? You're an engineer. I mean, not too much. I mean, of course, I support Dave 100%, but I don't think
Engin Terzi: I just, I mean, I just don't think Ermes is going to be able to, I just don't think Ermes can beat him. Not only emotional, but you just think, think, think. You cannot picture in your mind that, you know, Ermes beating Dave. Oh.
Adam Wawrzynski: army certainly isn't going to beat him inside and with as strong as dave's hand is to be able to support his arm i don't think you can beat him outside in the strap either because if it goes outside and they i mean if it goes outside they're going to slip or at least dave's going to find a way to when you hook to dave it does armies have that kind of power to beat him i don't think so
Engin Terzi: I don't know. I don't think the Ermes is going to go inside. I really don't know what he's going to do, but I see an outside versus outside match, then I can picture. I see Dave so strong at the center, but how much his wrist will handle, how much Ermes' wrist will handle. I kind of see super powerful guys. The Ermes is more like this way, and Dave is more like pronated side pressure.
Engin Terzi: But when this tool pressure apply, I don't know the hand positions. It totally will have the, I mean, if they both are flat like this, I give the edge to Dave because he's so much used to pulling while Ermes needs to have control. He's used to controlling. So if Ermes gets the control,
Engin Terzi: risk control Ermes in my opinion can win but if they both are equally like this position you know I give the edge to Dave because I don't think that I have seen Ermes pulling like this so much I don't know and and what's your opinion yeah if if Ermes can maintain the control and can apply good site
Bozhidar Simeonov: He would win, but if he loses just a little bit of the hand and the side of the match, he will lose. So it will be an interesting match. And where do you bet? I bet for Ermes. If he wants to prove he is the one to pull next Levan, he has to go through Dave. Yeah, but the same applies for Dave as well, right?
Engin Terzi: yeah for sure but we already watched dave against levan so yeah yeah but but um i asked to levon you know would you want to pull dave directly with strap you know as devon you know because they cannot get the third second levan said yeah he is he's ready and then i i told this to dave chaffee dave said oh it's good news you know and everybody wanted to see that match in strap yeah yeah and
Engin Terzi: If there is a rule like that, I think it will make everything more exciting. I don't know what the result will be. So basically, you support Ermes because of being your generation of bowler with the future, more future, because he is young. Is that what it is? I am personally a big fan of Dave. Oh, Dave, you are a fan of Dave. Okay, you support Ermes or Dave?
Adam Wawrzynski: I support them both, but I am. I am fan of Dave, but I want them as to win. I mean, I think another advantage that Dave has in this match and it's not a advantage that's it's always. One, but I mean Dave is a natural. Dave is naturally that large. I mean a couple as of a couple years ago. I don't think armies you know that frame isn't what came, you know.
Adam Wawrzynski: I mean, he is not naturally that big. I think that plays a huge factor. I mean, you can't, you know, it's very hard to compete. Dave is not that big, much larger human being. So you are saying that one is naturally super heavyweight, the other one is pushed to be super heavyweight. Yeah, I do. Sometimes even lighter guys can be very dangerous for heavier guys. They can be. I just think it gives Dave a big advantage.
Engin Terzi: I understand. I understand. Let's see. Let's see. I mean, an incredible event is waiting for us and we will see. We will have all those answers. But the good thing is that whenever we talk about the matches, we all go, hmm, you know, it is good news, you know, that, you know, we cannot be sure about the results except that 55-45 Adam versus Bozhidar match. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Anyways, guys, there is one last super chat. I will read and then we finish. Shane Bowen arm wrestling. These guys are too humble. I am not. Adam will make this look easy. Bozhidar is too small. He will save face and stay home. Devon't come home. Devon't come here. Stay home. I will eat some more proteins and I will come there. You will come? Bigger. Give me one more week. To eat more.
Engin Terzi: Adam, you said that one is naturally super heavyweight, other one is pushed to be super heavyweight. Does it apply to you and Bozhidar as well, that while you are naturally middleweight and this guy is pushing himself to be middleweight? Not nearly at the scale is what I was talking about with Dave and Ermes. I mean, you know, Bozhidar, you're naturally gaining weight, you're
Adam Wawrzynski: what 100 i assume 190 pounds 85 kilo maybe slightly under i mean i'm 208 pounds i mean that's not a that's an advantage i do believe that in any match when there's a human being larger than the other even if it's just by a little bit but you know we'll see we'll see how uh we'll see how it plays out i mean i don't think it's
Engin Terzi: significant enough to really put it put it in perspective to an opinion of the match i i don't think it's big enough and and if you come here again to istanbul you know we have the weight classes changed we've made like 187 and 209 and then it's going like this 231 so your weight class will be 209 correct that's correct
Engin Terzi: yeah we're gonna we're gonna for the future events we're gonna find you a good 209 guy from over here probably a georgian guy would be good yeah sounds good yeah and another question are you ready to pull like if he if he would said like for example david samusha not that i'm i'm planning to set or something like would never know would you pull like samusha at
Engin Terzi: uh for the um no samusha is 85 kilo title right yeah okay and for for 95 kilo he doesn't have the title shot and in in january uh rushtan babayev is coming in january yeah rushtan babayev is coming we already made agreement do you think that rushtan babayev is a guy that deserves a direct title shot with right arm
Engin Terzi: yes he's multiple times world champions yes 20 times yes it's so many years yeah of course in my opinion yes you know some people don't understand how can this guy come and do this i mean just open the the lists of the for the past two years and realize yeah anyway so thank you very much guys sorry for keeping you so long
Engin Terzi: and see you in what probably less than 10 days and he will be very excited just we will rock you know everything will be very good yeah thank you adam for joining thank you thank you thank you
