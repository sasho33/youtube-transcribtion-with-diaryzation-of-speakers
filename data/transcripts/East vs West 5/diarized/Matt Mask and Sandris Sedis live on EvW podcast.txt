Engin Terzi: Hello, guys. Hello, Victor. Hello, my friends. What's up? What's up? Little boy. Hello, official arm machine television. Good day, my friends.
Engin Terzi: Hello, hello Comer.
Engin Terzi: Aleykum Salaam, Kardeşim. Hello, Colonel. Clerks, hello, my friends. Okay. Hello, Engin Turbo. Hello, Edwin. Hello, my friends. Aleykum Salaam, Mugair.
Engin Terzi: Let's see if anyone comments. No. Hello, Andrew. I don't know how you do it, but East versus West five card looks even better than four. My friends.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, we can do at the same time. Do you also suggest this to every organization or are you just suggesting only me? Please before your guests come, can you ask Michael Todd and Dennis, would they play table tennis after East versus West?
Engin Terzi: I am not sure because East versus West ends about like what 12 AM or like 1 AM in the morning or something. Um, I don't really remember them, you know, hanging out. I didn't see Iron House. I only saw small clips. Can you special guest sign t-shirts? Um, I don't know. I can ask them, but it will be.
Engin Terzi: probably i mean i think it would be better if they sign when they come as a competitor um how can i know my friends what is what is the devil not us upcoming matches i have no idea what he's planning what he's doing
Engin Terzi: Yeah, doping testing requires money. I mean, it is affordable, but it would make no sense if only I do and the rest of the organizations don't do it. Then I don't want to go deeply, but if something is going to start, we need to start all together. Would you consider making the winners of Ongarbeyev-Iraqli Pace-John for East versus West 7? Yes, of course, I would consider, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Whenever John wants, I will ask Ongar Bayev that, you know, John, you know, would like to pull him once again. You know, I'm sure that Ongar Bayev will respect his request. And then we'll pull him again. This is my guess. We will see how it will be. The day after, usually they are gone, my friends. You all think Engin got a magic ball.
Engin Terzi: I mean, if you call Lau as a magic ball, yes, I have one for arm wrestling. Engin, can you ban Paul Italia for East versus West? Thank you. Why would I ban him? I will use strict rules for Jerry versus Ermes. But the elbow pads will not be 18 by 18. It will be 20 by 20.
Engin Terzi: So there will be a room for Ermes to come one something behind the back. And then there will be a room for one something for Jerry to come forward. So it's equal. But it will be 20. And if any little elbow get out, we will call it. If the pads are 20, 20, then if still they are making the elbow out, then no, I'm sorry. They need to keep it. But those small, like this tiny jumps like this, we will not call.
Engin Terzi: But if it is just, you know, like gain an advantage like this, then we will. Do I think Matt Mask is now in his prime? I don't know. He knows better, but he looks very good. I can't .
Engin Terzi: um would bomb be dry most if it didn't cut so much weight i don't know my friend you need to ask them about arson i don't know yet while we still um keeping that band and we will see we will see but i'm doing my best
Engin Terzi: But Ferit Osmanlı will be participating in January as a new athlete for East versus West. And Alex Kurdeyka, he will be part of it. But their opponents, we don't know yet. Their opponents are so much up to the results of November events. Because there are athletes like
Engin Terzi: For example, Revaz and Morozov, we don't know what's going to happen in that match. And then we will see, we will see. There will be Jerry versus Ermes. Gennady is missing this event, but he will be here as a guest. And Dave Chaffee, yeah, they will be a good one. I don't know what Ferid's waiting for right now. He came and visited me.
Engin Terzi: How open do the champions in each weight category have to compete to keep the titles? Once every two events, if they don't compete for two events, you'll... Nah, there is nothing like that. There is nothing like that. As I said, you know, people wants to make arm wrestling so like, I have to say strict rules and everything, you know, about these kinds of things, but just, just remember,
Engin Terzi: Our masters are not, not really professional athletes. They all have another job. And like, it is not like as professional as like, just say like UFC or boxing or something. So we will be with these, these guys are my friends, you know, we are like flexible.
Engin Terzi: If the guy says, Engin, I have this kind of problem, this I need to miss, I have a problem with the job. Oh, okay, no, I got your title. Justin give me your title. No, this is not like that. The way that Engin Terzi is working is a little bit different than the other others. Ours is more like friendship. I'm sure those athletes, sooner or later, they will compete. They will compete. If they don't want to compete,
Engin Terzi: they will also say that you know they don't want to uh compete yeah but hello hello to texas michael hello paul mark thank you for everything i can wait to met much intensity
Engin Terzi: between Sandris do yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Sandris is not so intense guy. He looks cool, but he's for sure like a challenging guy. You can, you can see, let's say we will see soon, you know, when they come, I don't know why they didn't come. Justin one second.
SPEAKER_02: Justin one second. Hello.
Matt Mask: Hello, Matt. Hello, my friend. How are you? Yeah, good. Justin having issues for some reason. I couldn't open the link you had sent me on Messenger, so I had to copy-paste it, email it to myself. Justin give me one second. I will check. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I'm back yeah. You hear me. I hear you good yeah you hear me. I was just taking some of this as well. When when both of you didn't make it you know right time I was like maybe something is wrong with my link you know. yeah yeah yeah. hair looks good.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Better than his. Better than his, eh? You need to talk to the doctor. The Turkish doctor, you should say, tell him that, hey, there is a guy who invited me here. You need to take care of him as well, you know? Yeah. Oh, for sure. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to him. He knows who you are. He knows who you are. Hello, Sandris. How are you, my friend? Hello. I'm good. How are you? Good, good, good, good.
Engin Terzi: okay cobra water engine sunday is too strong for matt mask mask needs his hair to grow longer so he can get stronger i'm growing it out till november 19th so um people were thinking that that that you are done you're finished you understand after they saw you at the east versus where they were thinking that like why do you want in white mats here and i was like come on guys you don't you don't even know what you are talking about
Engin Terzi: Matt would never ask me to invite him again if he didn't have something to prove, you know. Am I wrong, Matt, or? Well, 100%. Yeah, yeah. So you're going to basically, you're going to come and kick Sandris's ass, right? That's my plan, yeah. Yeah. Right now, I can still say it with a smile on my face, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See?
Engin Terzi: uh krasimir is such a respectful guy that you hardly held you know your energy in you you know after you win like you could only get out like 25 i think it was like out of because of respect you understand you just didn't want to be so like am i correct or yeah well it's yeah it's what what if it was more of a war right what if it was exactly
Engin Terzi: Oh, I would have been. Sandris is almost the type of guy like lrakli. Evgeny Warsaw. Yeah, I'm very nice. I'm very nice. Yeah. Oh, okay. See, the difference between lrakli
Matt Mask: and fucking sandries is that sandries doesn't walk around with a diaper and is scared right so yeah braver what's what you are saying yeah 100 yeah yeah not as sensitive sensitive that's the word i'm looking for i don't care i don't care
Matt Mask: yeah exactly he understands that what happens on the table is left on the table right so off the table we can be completely content with each other when it comes to the table where that doesn't mean what we think or how we feel when we step off of the table right but i kind of i kind of have a feeling that when you come to istanbul next time and when you are on the same exact stage that you didn't have good experiences last time but this time more prepared
Engin Terzi: I'm sure that that will be more than Sandris at the moment. This is how I think. I'm not sure what you're saying. I'm just saying that you are coming to Istanbul for more than being in Sandris. You are on a mission. You came to Istanbul. You didn't perform so good, but you went there. Now you are in a good shape. You will probably be in better shape when you come.
Matt Mask: then you will show to say on the same stage what you can do this is how i am thinking maybe i'm imagining i don't know yeah i feel i feel like i still have a lot to prove so like i still i was kind of really questioning myself did i really deserve to be on that level do i deserve to go pull at east versus west so my match with krazy was okay yeah i do belong on that level but and not i don't just want to hit the fringe of it i want to
Matt Mask: I want to be one of the motherfuckers that everybody's fucking worried about, right? So, so that's, that's my, my plan is I'm coming in and I want to take over that 253 pound weight class. So yeah, that's, that's where I'm going to concentrate on. I'm not going to try to go up and wait. I'm not going to try to go down and wait 253 pounds. I can train my ass off. I can sit around 255, skip two meals, weigh in at 253 and I'll be, that's where I want to be. So.
Engin Terzi: And Sandris, will you allow him to fulfill his dreams? No, no way. No way. Okay. I'm going to win and we're not asking for your permission. I'm a terrible person. Terrible. Yeah. Justin watch the fucking get it in there.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah and and time there is you ever lost a round in last year two matches at East versus West or both were three zero three zero chance was three zero three one no no both matches were three zero and uh I am I'm still to lose uh uh competition this year so well seven times the charm competition yeah
Engin Terzi: would it would be cool to go whole year without losing a competition that would be nice yeah but but but are you are you planning to go like trio think you know against matt as well well that's the plan but you never know what's going to happen you know okay but can you say that can you say that he is the uh most serious opponent so far
Sandris Sedis: Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah, very, very strong, very, very good top ball, you know, and I will have to find a way how to deal with that, that hand and that back pressure of his, you know. But you realize that you will not see the the mat that showed up here last May, right? You will see someone else you realize that, right?
Sandris Sedis: Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, of course. I know he's training, I know he's improving, you know, preparing. You know, hair is looking great as well. So let's see how it goes, you know. We are quite different, you know. I am without and with a beard and he's opposite. So we'll see how it goes.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but the question to you, of course, you said that, you know, you are, Matt is the, like, the most serious opponent at the East versus West for you. And so far. So the question is, like, so does it mean that you are not as confident as you were, like, for example, you were against Lachlan? Yeah.
Sandris Sedis: it's hard to say i think i think lachlan was uh much more comfortable for me he has uh shorter levers you know and against guys like that it's much more easier for me to to top roll and to go over the hand but uh some some good top top rollers with that
Sandris Sedis: posting posting style can give me problems sometimes so uh matt is definitely you know the the the most i would say dangerous and the most uh serious opponent uh to date yeah like against lachlan because of your technical abilities you were feeling like you are the hunter but but with mask
Sandris Sedis: maybe it is not the case because he is also very good at what he is doing. Like the one perfect move, you know. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. And now Matt also, you know, on a hunt, if you can say, has to, I don't know if he has to prove something, but, you know, has to come back a little bit and...
Sandris Sedis: know show that uh i don't know for himself or for for iraqli i don't think he cares about directly that much but you know he just have to you know more for himself show that he's he still got it and he can compete with everyone you know and matt what do you think about all this yeah pretty much bang on yeah pretty much bang on yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: And Sandris, do you have a goal to win the title also? Of course, of course. Matt is not the only one that who is coming to Istanbul only for his opponent, but like seeing as it like first step of the main goal.
Sandris Sedis: you it will be like the third third step of the main goal but yeah i want to show the time you know right there with the best you know top three top uh that top spot and uh i'm working very hard uh and this year it's been it's been very intense and uh
Engin Terzi: hope that you know i can i can go through matt as well and you know then we'll see we'll see where it goes i understand i understand and matt uh who do you want to pull after this one um or you are ready to pull anyone or is is there any anyone on your mind for the next step of course you are not gonna if you beat sundries
Matt Mask: you are not going to go directly to the title match or something. But is there anyone around that weight class that you would like to pull against? I'm not even sure. Whoever is the next opponent on the list. So I want to, honestly, I want to obviously,
Matt Mask: sweep sandries and then i want to work my way up earn myself that title shot obviously nobody's going to be giving anybody a title shot off of one or two wins right so it's it's more something yeah i want to i want to chip away i want to work my way through everybody over the next year year and a half two years whatever it takes one by one
Engin Terzi: i'm coming for everybody in that weight class till whoever stand at the top with that shield in their hand if you keep winning for sure most likely this for sure for sure this year you will have that that that shot yeah yeah and that's yeah i mean i'm in 2023 sorry about it yeah
Matt Mask: Yeah, whatever year, even if it's 2024, I don't care. No, no, no. The next person, I just want to chip away through everybody in that 253-pound class until there's nobody left until the last man standing. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Engin Terzi: And you talked with Krasimir after the match. How did he compare you with lrakli? Did he say anything or he was upset? He said I felt 5% stronger. 5% stronger, yeah. Yeah, that's what he said. I mean, you always had the potential. You always had the potential. It was all up to if you, I mean, pay the price and train. As you told me that now you're training almost every day.
Matt Mask: and if you do that we see where you are but you know nobody is going to get the top yeah i thought i thought it was going to come a lot quicker than it was going to like i was like god muscle memory two three months back in bang i'll be right where i left off right and that you know maybe it's age now because i'm in my 40s i don't know what it is but it seems like it's
Matt Mask: it's happening slower but the progress that i am making is sticking around it's not it's not in and out i'm not going hard for three four months then wrestling for three months going hard for two months i'm resting for a month or two it's just continuously building right so yeah my my opinion compared to may my opinion god knows the best you know better than i do um
Engin Terzi: I see 15% minimum you are stronger than your performance at May. And my opinion, maybe it can be even 20. My opinion, the math mask that pulled Krasimir would probably beat Prudnik of May. I'm not saying the Prudnik of August. Trust me, Prudnik of August was different. The math mask that pulled Krasimir knowing what he knows now. Yeah.
Matt Mask: would it would have been a completely different outcome anyways or at least been more of a show you know yeah yeah the the the
Matt Mask: In fact, like you were in, sorry, but bad shape. You were in bad shape in May. But Prudnik also wasn't in good shape. No, you can see the difference in him now compared to when he pulled Hutchins. It was, yeah, it wasn't even, you know, Matt Mask now against the Prudnik now. This Matt Mask needs more time, right? That's what I wanted to say, yeah. He's still young. His muscle memory is a little better than mine.
Engin Terzi: The reason that you know he was so nervous about you know those things that because before you he lost against Tobias with left arm and then he was also afraid that you know it's not same thing was going to happen with you and that is why he was securing you know whenever I talked with him he said I was afraid to lose.
Matt Mask: Well, it was, I was just like, I just wasn't expecting as much fuck around as he was. Right. So whatever, you know what I mean? It is what it is. It's he made, made a good point. You know what I mean? Showed me, showed me that there's a lot of things I need to fucking work on and it's not, you know what I mean? You're not just going to walk down the fucking street without being fully prepared. Right. So.
Engin Terzi: I'm so happy that you used that time since May very well and you brought yourself to somewhere that your fans would like to see you. And that was I was very happy to see. Not that I was happy that you beat Krasimir. Krasimir is also my good friend. But to see you in good shape also because that match kind of look a little bit, you know, the distance between you two. Yeah. And yeah. And let's see. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I mean, I was just thinking how you versus lrakli would be. But now I think that, you know, especially with the weight difference, lrakli was 95 kilos here when he came.
Engin Terzi: you are probably around what 115 kilo or something 100 yeah i'm like 245 to 248 right now for pounds okay okay so you you plan to gain some more weight if possible yeah i'm hoping i'm hoping my walk around weight is around 255 to 260 and then it's just a matter of a water cut down to 253 for weigh-ins right do you think that if you win in november you can pull two months later in january as well or no
Matt Mask: Yeah, 100%. Yeah. I plan on going through Sandris so quick and so easy that when I'm done, I wake up the next morning and I'm down in the weight room in the fucking hotel working out again because I need more of a pump. Sandris, do you think that I will invite Matt Mask to January event or no?
Engin Terzi: I think for sure. Why not? Oh, because I just told him that I'm going to invite him if he wins. And now you're saying for sure, why not? Okay. Maybe you invite him if he loses. No, no. I think you should make the turn. Okay, invite him, but as a guest or something, you know. Yeah, as maybe a commentator or something. Okay.
Engin Terzi: because one of you will be invited in january so okay okay then don't invite him then don't invite him i mean it's it's not like don't invite him it is like you should say not don't invite him but you should say you will not invite him i understand that yeah yeah yeah yeah there is there is one question for you fallen for your tricks and get
Engin Terzi: they're gonna have to dig a little deeper into that little box unfortunately in 2022 the things are looks like you know i'm learning it's working that way yeah um sperm is as he's screaming anyways i think he's your uh countryman he says matt all of canada is with your brother
Engin Terzi: he's showing you his sports and let's see um mark is asking ending can you ask sandris what he thought of the matt versus classy match uh i thought that
Sandris Sedis: It went a little bit. I didn't think that Matt would be that dominant as he was, you know, thought maybe, you know, Crossy could do something. But Crossy right now, it's hard to tell, you know, where he is at the moment, at what level, you know. He has been losing a lot, but he has been pulling complete monsters as well, you know.
Sandris Sedis: out of his weight. And I think Krasi maybe has to compete in 105 kilo class. I think that's much, much more better for him and he could really dominate in there. But yeah, Matt looked very, very dominant, very intense, you know, as always, you know, jumping all around the table. You know, that's how he does it. And
Engin Terzi: Some may love it, some may hate it, but, you know, he brings the intensity to the table and it's always entertaining to watch Matt pull, you know. I understand. So it was stronger than what you expected. Yeah. But if you would know that you are going to face Matt Maskell last May,
Sandris Sedis: would be confident of winning right now i think so i think so yeah uh if you would ask me this in uh february you know could i could i win the mask of may you know maybe maybe not but you know this this this shape current shape that i mean i i'm pretty confident i would beat him
Engin Terzi: I understand. And we saw you pulling with Devon. It was after your super match, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it was, it was the, the, the, what's the call that the read them or something, you know, whatever the beat the guy till the bad sir. Like, I mean, stable surface, right? Yeah.
Matt Mask: yeah yeah or hold them off of the table area for three seconds ah yeah yeah so the one that he said that one more year is actually in if it was our machine table it would be pin right oh yeah oh yeah okay yeah yeah i understand he was touching the sweater just wasn't touching uh the table underneath
Matt Mask: So, but it's a different, like, that's, you can't even compare that because it was, Devon was sitting on the table all fucking night, half of the tournament when we were running the tournament, Devon was upstairs pulling with Gridec, so there was, you know, like, you can't, you can't ever compare to how somebody looks on the after table because you never know. What if Devon comes and beats Prudnik and then if Devon is the one to beat to get the title?
Engin Terzi: Well, then I'll end up having to face Devon eventually, right? Yeah. So it wouldn't change any of your plans, I guess. No. No, it doesn't matter. No. Okay. Yeah. So you are just saying that everyone who is 253 pounds and under. Everybody's in trouble. Breathing and arm wrestling, you are ready for. You will be ready. Every single one of them I'm coming for. One at a time.
Engin Terzi: So that's good. That's good. That's good. That is it. That is the match that we would like to see. And I'm very happy to see that. I like when you just you let me know who's next. And and I'm going for them. I don't care who it is. I if you beat Sundays, there is one guy. And when when?
Engin Terzi: january when when i beat sundries oh okay okay yeah okay okay so when you when you beat sundries there we go okay yeah then yeah there is one opponent that he is looking for a match most likely you know
Engin Terzi: I will say, I'm not going to name it, but if not, I shouldn't say if, right? When, right? When you beat Sandris, yeah. Sandris, are you being intimidated? No, no, I'm just, you know, Matt's just too funny. I like a good joke, you know.
Engin Terzi: He's got a sense of humor, right? We'll get along just fine afterwards. At the moment, yes. I kind of see Matt more confident, but let's see. Let's see how it will be. It's not that easy to hook Matt. It's not that easy. So I'm expecting it to be a top row versus top row match. And how tall are you?
Engin Terzi: sandris i am six four so you are about like 193 yeah yeah maybe you're 94 94 yeah and matt is probably around there too what are you six five six five six five and a half oh okay so not so much no not advantage a little bit yeah yeah it will be it will be nice yeah
Engin Terzi: Let's see how it will be. But I can see that Sandris is not as confident as he was against Lachlan. Against the Australian, he was just talking non-stop, I'm going to do it to you. But was it because of your personality or because he was also so confident that he was making you talk like that, Sandris? No, because, you know, Australians, you know, they talk a lot on the media, but...
Sandris Sedis: they can't really back it up like with achievements or anything because I just know that I just knew that they are clearly out of the out of the waters you know because if you haven't been to those competitions like world Europeans you know the highest level you don't have that experience and
Sandris Sedis: You can be as strong as you want, but, you know, at the end it shows. And, yeah, I just knew that the things I have done before and the strengths that I have and the power needed to win all those tournaments, you know, I just knew that, you know, they won't be able to do anything really. And how old are you, Sandris? 28.
Sandris Sedis: 28 yeah i believe you are still picking yeah yeah i'm just getting better with every competition you know where it's going up feeling better on table as well so just just improving yeah so you will be 110 kilo for love or you're pulling supers
Sandris Sedis: yeah so i'm actually not really thinking about math at the moment because i'm all focused at to to you know going there and to to win that and i will be at 110 kilos i still have to cut a few kilos i'm walking around 114 now so still have a quite a bit of work to do but yeah i'm just focused on web
Sandris Sedis: Of course, I implement some things, you know, in my training to try to prepare for MET as well, but it really doesn't work that well because, you know, you can't really prepare at the same time for, you know, two different things, you know. But, yeah, after WEF, you know, we'll see how I feel.
Sandris Sedis: Hopefully I don't have any injuries or anything and I can recover for one week and then a couple of weeks of training, getting my shape in place and then go to East vs West against Matt. But all concentration right now is above.
Sandris Sedis: I understand because that is before that one, yeah. Still four weeks left till that and we have been training hard every day. You will be traveling to Turkey again, to Antalya this time? Yes, yes, yes. You were in Antalya in 2018 WAF? 2018 was my first WAF tournament, yes, and finished 10th place with both arms then. How did it happen? Did you not win?
Engin Terzi: zloty same year only a month later four weeks later i think it was like yeah maybe four weeks four weeks later in 10th place at wav and then four weeks later you won the zloty
Sandris Sedis: Yeah, I don't know what it was. It was just everything was clicking on that day because I wasn't feeling that great as well. I actually went to that tournament with hopes on the left arm. But on the left, I finished eighth, I think. And my right arm, my inner elbow was hurting as well. So I wasn't that confident. But at that day, I don't know what it was.
Sandris Sedis: everything just clicked you know uh my starts were excellent you know everything second in the overalls as well yeah behind putnik second overall yeah and in the overall top three there was no super weight
Engin Terzi: Brittany was a 95-kilo winner, you were a 105-kilo winner, and the third was a 78-kilo winner, Davit Samushia. Samushia, yes. It was interesting, yeah. We beat all the heavyweights in the overalls. So we beat two Russian guys, huge guys. Yeah. It was good. And the question, Sandris, who do you want to pull in January? I would love to pull someone from America, maybe Todd, maybe Marcio.
Engin Terzi: yeah okay that's all yeah so after you beat matt you're gonna pull someone from north america again okay yeah i want to beat i want to beat all of north america i know and then maybe some europeans after that but you need to finish the whole north america first yeah yeah that's the plan but but under 115 right not the supreme weight
Sandris Sedis: I don't know who is there from Super Heavyweight. It's only like Chaffee. Chaffee, Jerry Cadoret. Well, I beat Jerry already, so that doesn't count. In the overall? Oh, you mean after the event, yeah. I won the title. Number two in the world now. Number two in the world. I understand. And so, yeah.
Engin Terzi: And I have a question for you, Sandris. You said, did you mention Todd? You meant like Todd Hutchings or Michael Todd? Hutchings, yeah. Todd Hutchings is under 105 kilo. How about Michael Todd? Do you think you have the skill to beat him? Someone like him? If he's 115 kilo, do you think that you can adjust that?
Sandris Sedis: Yeah, under 115, I think I have good chances of beating Todd. I think my hand is stronger. The only way he can, you know, beat me is, you know, just with the bone lock position, you know, out with the endurance or stuff, you know. But, yeah, I think I can press, you know, I can top roll, I can...
Engin Terzi: I can definitely win his hand, you know. There are many possibilities for me to beat him. Matt, you are not getting upset, right? Whenever I ask him about January opponents, I'm just teasing you. Absolutely not. No. Yeah. Yeah. Matt, question for you. How do you see Prudnik versus Michael Todd match?
Matt Mask: I think Prudnik has a good chance, especially just with his table sparks and everything else and his ability to build the transition. He's not a one-trick pony, right? So it's, you know, he's a lot smarter than a lot of the other arm wrestlers out there. And I believe, yeah, I think Prudnik can do it. If I was a betting man, I would put money on Prudnik.
Matt Mask: but you don't see a domination right away, but you see like you're working on it. Yeah, I see. It's not going to be, he might dominate one round, but then you're going to see a bit of an adjustment from Michael. Then it's going to stall. Then you're going to see him work some different angles. Mike might even take one or two out of it, but I think, I think Prudence is going to do it. So you are saying that Mike may win. So you are expecting that? He may, he may win one or two rounds, I believe.
Engin Terzi: but uh but i would say if i was betting on it i'd be putting my money on prudnik yeah yeah whenever you say that prudnik is not like one trick pony you know but um like whenever we talk about michael todd we are talking about something totally different you know like pulling against shoulder pressure pulling against hook side pressure top row like these are something that you can experience you know in one tournament
Engin Terzi: all of them, possibly. But pulling against Michael Todd is just, I don't know if Prudnik has any experience with this. He has pulled and lost against Pascal Gerrard 13 years ago, but he was very young, 21 years old or something. It was like, what, eight-minute match or 10-minute match or something at the Europeans, 2009 Europeans. It was around 10 minutes. But after that, I don't know if he has ever experienced
Sandris Sedis: And Sandris, how do you see that match? The same. I think Prudnik will win. I think he has all the tools to do it. He has the hand control. He's very fast as well, very versatile. I don't know if Mike can do much with him. I think Prudnik will take it pretty convincingly.
Engin Terzi: So you don't expect a war? Maybe one round, but not much. I understand. Let's see how it will be. Do you know Petrenko? Probably you don't know Oleg Petrenko, right? You guys from the West are not so familiar with the Eastern guys.
Engin Terzi: um but they are they all know you guys because you are more like because of wal and other things and social media you guys are more popular this is why they know you guys but you don't know much about them yeah oleg petrenko but you know it right sandris oleg petrenko yeah very well from his match with john uh i expect the war but if petrenko will
Engin Terzi: be in the same shape as he was against Raimonds, I think John will win. Do you think that Petrenko somehow underestimated your friend, Raimonds? Maybe, maybe, yeah. I'm talking about not the competition day, but talking about preparation.
Sandris Sedis: yeah i think maybe yeah because uh on the other hand ryman's was uh working very hard for like uh two years almost preparing for that match and he did a great job great job on yeah on prep and uh maybe or petrenko did
Sandris Sedis: you know, take it more lightly. Yeah, I think I think I think if there is no issues with John, you know, health wise and he's he's in his best shape, he can be. I think I think John has has has the tools to to win the match. I understand. I understand. And Matt, Jerry versus I think you already expressed this in another live, but
Matt Mask: Jerry versus Ermes? I think it could be very interesting. I think that a lot of people aren't given Ermes the credit for his ability to be able to transition from a top role into a press, especially like how we did with Michael Todd when he pulled him at he was only, I think, 200 pounds at the time or something like that. But yeah, I think if Ermes can keep his hand
Matt Mask: in front of his shoulder throughout the supermatch and he doesn't get caught here where Jerry's going to drive straight down on him. I think I think Irmys has actually just stylistically. I believe that if Irmys can commit his shoulder in behind, drive out enough to where Jerry gets into this position and his hand just separates a bit from his shoulder. And from that point, Irmys can get him behind his arm. I think I think it's going to be Irmys all day long.
Matt Mask: Yeah, you know, it's just kind of easy. I do believe if Ermes gets a little too crazy with the drive and separates out here, I think that's where Jerry's going to capitalize on it. Because once once Ermes gets with his shoulder in front of his hand and Jerry's able to drive down, it's hard to get back in behind it without injuring yourself or driving your elbow or something, right?
Engin Terzi: I believe that's where Jerry could get it. But if Ermes can commit his shoulder behind his hand, it's all Ermes. Yeah, I mean, it is easier to do the shoulder pressure against Michael because he is usually stopping you in a losing position while Jerry likes to, you know, position and, you know, win inside. But, you know, once you bring Jerry here, I don't think that it will be incredibly hard to after you bring him, you know, outside of his
Matt Mask: And I don't think it's something that Ernie's is going to be able to take his time on. I think it's something that he needs to work quick where he can stop Jerry here as long as he contains, keeps that shoulder commitment and does one or two quick drives to get Jerry here. And then quickly walk him behind his arm and drive down. But it's got to happen quick because when you're driving in this position, you're using a lot more muscle where
Engin Terzi: than you are into that press position. So do you think that it would be a good idea for him to start with the pressure with the downside of his hand to the side pressure in the past that maybe you remember or not, but Ron and John has done it, you know, like with the like a little bit low grip and pressing here.
Matt Mask: Yeah, yes and no, if you can control that bone at the same time. But also Jerry, you think Jerry's a 100% commit to the flop, but he's not. Jerry's actually really good in a hook now too. So his ability to drive inside, like he's actually going for this position, but when he gets his hand, he can still pull the flop. So I think then you're looking at a hook war, it's a completely different story, right?
Matt Mask: yeah i mean i don't know where ermy's hook is compared i do believe that jerry does have a hook that can bang with probably some of the best hookers in the world and i don't know exactly where ermy's hook is on that scale compared to but how did you go to hook when i said like this side pressure root here it doesn't mean that he's gonna give his uh pronator he can still
Matt Mask: continue that way. So you are saying that there is a risk when you do this kind of pressure. I think there's a chance where Jerry can get. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you are saying that if he does any kind of the downside, you know, side pressure, he needs to be very careful with his. You got a teeter on top because if you come up a little too much. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be especially especially Ermes is Ermes is also a type of polar where he posts a lot.
Matt Mask: when he's rising, like he rises really hard off the start, he doesn't have that protection to protect you from getting into a hook with a little bit of a down rise with your top roll. So Ermias being up here, if you get that chop and it's just a matter of turning this and you're inside a hook, right? One round, one round, Gennady wanted to just go inside. It didn't end good, you know. Maybe you remember it was the...
Matt Mask: Well, that's what I mean. Like, Ermi's ability to back pressure and promenade through is, it's a lot. Like, he's proven himself to be one of the best hoppers in the world right now, right? Yeah. And Sandris, how do you see that match? I agree with Matt, but...
Sandris Sedis: Having experienced Jerry in the after pool, you know, I know it's after the match and everyone is tired, you know, it's not the same, you know, can't really compare. But what I experienced, I think Ermes can definitely take the hand pretty easily. But Ermes is actually nervous as well because he actually asked me, you know, for my advice, you know, what I think.
Sandris Sedis: of Matt, of Jerry, and how to beat Jerry. So I know Ermes is actually pretty nervous because he hasn't pulled anyone like that before. And I think he asked me about hook as well, you know, and I said that, you know, in hook there's no way, no way Ermes can beat Jerry. I don't see it, at least. And
Sandris Sedis: uh yeah ermus has to go with the pronator you know over the hand he he can't just stay on his back pressure you know and if he can go over the center with the pronation like this
Sandris Sedis: and straight to the pad, then he has a possibility. But if he will do what he does all the time, you know, just post and go back, I don't think it's going to end well for Ermes if he does that. Yeah, I will, Sandris. Matt, just can you look at Sandris? Can you bring your hand down, Sandris? I mean, does he look...
Engin Terzi: very very big or it just looks to me that way or it looks like that seriously like i'm looking at you looks like your head is from a small kid to the body you know seriously you i don't know maybe it's because of the view but you really look big you know because he's like this yeah
Engin Terzi: And another interesting match. I think you have been following, you competed first one and third one East versus West, Matt, but you are probably following Revaz and Morozov. Did you know that these guys are going to pull against each other in November? Revaz and Morozov? Yeah. That right arm or left arm? Right arm. Right arm? Yeah. What do you think? Sick match?
Matt Mask: I don't know, man. Morozov is on, in my eyes, he's getting to a different level where very, very soon there's not going to be very many heavyweights where you're going to be able to match him up against, I don't think.
Matt Mask: So, like, Rabah is very impressive against his match with Michael Todd. He's only two months trained, you know, after four years of break. From 2018... And he's a beast. Like, he's coming back on a tear. But I just believe the potential that Morozov has and the progression that he is making right now, especially at his age, being as young as he is...
Engin Terzi: I think that if Revaz is going to do it, he better hurry up and do it soon because it can be long and there's not many people in that super heavyweight division that are going to be able to touch him. Yeah. The thing is, Morozov has been in very good shape and he's really like pushing, pushing, pushing there, while Revaz is someone that hasn't really super trained, you know, for in his life.
Engin Terzi: so he now told me that he is first time in his life is taking our message this seriously and of course you know derek was not didn't look at his level and but you know he was he looked too much there and now we have three and a half months from august to august 6 to
Engin Terzi: November 19, three and a half months. So I'm just saying that for someone who did not train a lot in his life and also was inactive last three and a half years before Michael Todd match. So I think that the progress that he may do may be more than Morozov because he is not pushing his limits yet.
Matt Mask: Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe we could see. And it's yeah, yeah, you may be right, you know. So who knows? He could end up because of his progression from just starting to train from not doing it ever to all of a sudden going in full out. It could just skyrocket him up, right? So do you expect like a hook win for Morozov as he did the last round to Dave Chaffee? Or do you expect Morozov to also top role
Matt Mask: I'm not really sure. That all depends on where obviously the pressure is being applied and where he feels he has a better chance, right? And that's the thing. Morozov is able to pull inside and he is able to pull outside as well. So if he doesn't feel like he's able to do something outside, while you know down well, he's going to be coming at you the next round, right? So...
Sandris Sedis: And, Sandrís, how do you see their match, my friend? Definitely a good match. I think it's a close match as well. Morozov, before the last event, I would say that with right arm, probably Ramos has the edge. But now, when Morozov beat Dave, I think it's very close and it can go either way, really.
Engin Terzi: And any technical analyze, like, do you see Morozov, as I asked Matt, beating possibly Ravas even outside? Or do you think, I kind of believe in one thing, that if somehow Morozov hooks Ravas, Morozov is going to beat him, my opinion. But can he hook him or not? I don't know about that one. Because you try to hook and then he may top roll you, you may find yourself on the pad, you know? Yeah, I agree. I agree.
Engin Terzi: yeah and both are very tall guys very tall guys yeah big tall and matt how was uh morozov because we asked people what are their heights and like did you see morozov about your height do you remember at all because yeah he's like within
Engin Terzi: He's within an inch of where I think I might have just a little bit on him, but not very much. I think he's right around 6'5 or 6'4 and a half, something like that. My height's around that. Yeah. Let's see. That's another good match, yeah. And there is a left-arm match between Prudnik and Dadikian. And Dadikian easily beats
Engin Terzi: Oleg Dzok and he kind of was aggressive when he was winning and most of the people didn't like his aggression and some people said this is competition a combat sport and this is a like normal thing to do and some people took it in a political way and then and some people says no it is just like a table reaction you know and so but people thought that I said that match after those reactions but in fact
Engin Terzi: even that night when you were pulling with Jerry Sandris in the lobby. And at that time, they both came and they said they want to pull. And so that match was ready already, you know, before I put the videos on YouTube or something. And how do you see that match, Sandris? It's definitely a hook war, I think.
Sandris Sedis: We saw some glimpse in the after poll of both of them, what they can do. And I think it's also a close match, but about its behavior, you know, I really didn't like it as well. I thought it was a little bit too intense and unnecessary.
Sandris Sedis: So I think it's going to be even more intense with Prudnik. Like, it doesn't matter which guy wins. The emotions will explode 100%. And I think it's going to be a hook war. And probably something like 3-2, maybe. Which way? I think, I hope, I'm rooting for Prudnik a little bit more. But it is...
Engin Terzi: So anything can happen, you are saying? Anything can happen, yeah. These last two matches... The match will be intense. You know, Zok wasn't intense. And also, Prudnik can be intense, but he doesn't really show anything out, you know. I mean, he's just a pucker, you know, face. You know, the guy is just like full control of his emotions. And he never stops thinking. And did you see that after pull, Matt? No, I didn't, no. You didn't? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: They pull and after pull, it was a long hook war. And finally with the shoulder pressure, Prudnik won. But Prudnik was 107 kilo against Tatachins and Dadikyan was 102 kilo against Dzok. And so this time both will be at 115 kilo. And so at that time, Prudnik's left wasn't ready. He didn't come for a super match.
Engin Terzi: Dadikian's left was ready, but Dadikian pulled a super match against Oleg Sok. Prudnik pulled, but after pulls, you know, he did like maybe seven, eight, maybe 10 pulls with other people. And then he pulled Dadikian. So I am expecting a hook war as well. I don't think it will be an easy match, but let's see. You don't know much about Dadikian probably as well. Not a whole lot. No. Yeah. Except he's maybe training videos when you see with Dennis. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Let's see, let's see, let's see. There are some interesting matches, and this time Tatachins is not coming. He's going to pull Marharit Sandris. Probably Matt wouldn't know Marharit, but let's see how it will be. Marharit versus Tatachins in January. And Marharit will pull Vov as well. An interesting thing is that Marharit and then Ongarbeev is in the same class. They are in the same class.
Engin Terzi: also i don't really know if he's competing or not but kocak may be in same class because he he has won the nationals so that is also interesting category oh maybe brassy as well you know in that class oh yeah as well yeah yeah it's gonna be that yeah i think i think i think uh right now professional or amateur
Engin Terzi: about like 95 to 105 kilo is very very very dangerous category 115 as well but as of now under 15 prudnik looks like he is alone there as of now very dominant and then in the super hair weight from second place to just say 10th place super competition and then number one is alone there and but hopefully matt is gonna change it right the prudnik being alone there
Engin Terzi: Yeah. It's going to take some time. It's going to take some time, but I'll be there. You will be there, right? You have that dream. You have that dream. I'm going to let him have some fun with other people first. Okay. That's good. That's good. I mean, if it comes true or not true, I really love this kind of goals and dreams. Like honestly, I know you're from Canada and that one is your friend. How,
Engin Terzi: You have money, $100,000. Someone is giving you, you're going to put the money. The money is given to you, but honestly, I know you're an honest person. Only to put money. If you are not going to bet that money, they are going to take their money back. If you put their money and then you win, you get double, $200,000. There is 115 kilo Devon, 115 kilo Brunic. Say honestly.
Matt Mask: 115 kilo yeah 250 that's a different story so yeah yeah if if i had to make a bet i would
Matt Mask: I would probably put my money on Prudnik at 115 kilos. Because a 250-pound Devon is completely different than a 280, 290-pound Devon. Okay, I understand. I felt both of them. And if I was to have a super match, I would love to have a super match with a 250-pound Devon. As opposed to a 280-pound Devon.
Matt Mask: Is he that heavy now again? 280? No, he's probably sitting, I'd say, 265-ish. Yeah, okay. Maybe 270 at the most. Yeah. So he's been eating a lot cleaner, a lot less, a lot lighter meals, as opposed to just eating until he feels like puking every two hours, right? So he's eating a lot of salads.
Engin Terzi: a lot of salads like salad like four times a day like he's a fucking rabbit now or something so i understand and and a few more i will ask him we can finish like you probably wouldn't know again petrenko as we said before petrenko versus drop with left arm how do you see this on this with left arm uh
Sandris Sedis: Possible hook war as well. Possible hook war. Yes, yes, I agree. But Petrenko has a very, very strong hand, very strong fingers, so he can go outside as well, I think. And I don't see how Zurab could, you know, hold on to that hand. If they go and hook willingly, you know, that's a war. But outside, I think Petrenko would win pretty easily. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Engin Terzi: I understand. Yeah. And in January, there will be Iraqi versus on that web 105 kilo East versus West world title match. Who is winning that? Guys? As for now, I think I think rockley. But
Sandris Sedis: You know, Ungarbaev looked pretty good last event as well. I didn't feel much in the after pool though, but you know, it's just an after pool and nobody's going 100%. So I would give edge to, to Iraqli like 3-1. Okay. 3-1. So you are saying that Iraqli will have the title? Possibly. Possibly. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. That's, that's, that's, yeah.
Engin Terzi: It is because you felt him after pool in February. You are intimidated. Of course, of course. Yeah, I remember that. I remember that. He was like 1-1 with Prudnik after pool as well. Yeah, yeah. He was a little bit bigger than I think. Yeah.
Sandris Sedis: I wasn't really that in that good of a shape, but you know, yeah, back then he felt very strong. Yeah, I remember, but I'm sure that you are stronger since that time as well. Like much, much stronger, like two times stronger now. Nah, come on. 44% stronger. Justin say, let's agree with like 10, 15, yeah.
Matt Mask: Anyway, so these are, I think, all we can talk for today. And I wish you guys the best. Anything you want to say, Matt, to Sandris? Hurry up and get over with Worlds so you can concentrate on this motherfucker because I'm concentrating on you right now. And you're going to take his wrist, right? I'm going to crack it.
Matt Mask: Yeah, and you will be not as nice as you were to Krasimir. Well, I see that's the thing. I really like Sandris's too, right? Now, come on, come on. I do. I do, yeah. He's not, you know, I was hoping he'd come and kind of poke the bear a little bit, give me something to work with. But I got a lot of respect for Sandris's, his progression that he's been taking over the last couple of years. But no, I don't, it's not even...
Matt Mask: There's a difference. I'm going to snap. I'm going to lose my mind, but it's not going to be directed so much towards him as it will be to everybody else that's in the room, right? Yeah, but he's playing nice because he's scared of me.
Matt Mask: That's he's not. He fucking should be. He fucking should be. Why he is nice. I tell you right now, I'm feeling so fucking good right now. I fucking scare myself. It's so it's yeah. And we got two more months to go. So it's I'm just like he said when he went to his lot, everything's just starting to click. Everything feels like it's really starting to click right now. So.
Matt Mask: So, Matt, if Sandris continues to be such a nice guy, you will be easy on him before he beats? I'm not going to be easy on him. I'm not going to be easy on him. But I'm not going to scream in his face and, you know what I mean, fucking try to fist-fuck his hand into the table or anything. I'll try to be a little more respectful, somewhat reserved. But it's, like, it's...
Matt Mask: I don't know I don't know we'll see we'll see we'll see how the vibe is leading up to it and everything else it's I really don't have a whole lot of control. Over what's going on, obviously, if that person has been in a darker place in my mind, I can let more shit go, but someone like crazy it took a long time to get him.
Matt Mask: into a dark place in my mind where i still wanted to snap and freak out but i couldn't do it towards him because there's still that amount of respect towards him right but in short matt this guy is no way beating you right no way sundry oh there's no chance in hell he's just traveling there so that you can do one one more step that he's just right now he's just a stepping stone right now for me oh okay okay yeah
Matt Mask: Like I got nothing but respect for him. And I'm gaining more and more for him every day, the more I see from the more I hear about him, the more he talks, there's more and more respect built for him. But right now, I've got a mission, I've got a goal, I've got something set in my mind that I want to accomplish. And unfortunately, for him, he's in my fucking way. Okay, so all you need to do right now, you see, you need to just
Engin Terzi: like make a trip to Istanbul and come back because you have to for your next opponent. So that's how you see it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sandris, was it enough of provocation for you? You guys are funny. No, no. You can't provoke me that easily because
Sandris Sedis: Yeah, before the match happens, you know, I'm pretty calm. But once we get on that stage, once we get on that table, it's a completely different story. And I know that whoever gets the first pin, the shit's going to go off. Like, if Matt wins the first round, he's going to jump around, scream. I know that. And if I win, I might do a scream in his face, you know, something like that as well.
Sandris Sedis: Because I can't really control my emotions on a table. And if it's a really close match and a deep match, deep to my heart, I can get pretty intense. And that should be a great spectacle for the viewers. And these are his words. Did it motivate you a little bit more? No, I'm just...
Sandris Sedis: having a laugh, you know, just entertained. And so you, you, you find Matt funny. Okay. I understand. I have, I have enough, enough motivation, you know, I don't need any, you know, outside help. Oh, okay. Someone is really confident. Yeah. I can wait. I can wait. I can see already. Like great top row battle in this strap. Both are loading. Let's see who is this? This is going to fail.
Engin Terzi: That's the plan. That's the plan. I just can't see you hooking Matt. I think you will get top rolled, but who knows? Try it. Let's see. Let's see what happens. We'll see what happens. You never know. Honestly, how do you see your chance, Matt? Like, percentage. But honestly, not for, like,
Matt Mask: Like in your heart, mind, how do you see, do you see a 70-30 for yourself? Right now, just how I'm feeling, I see, yeah, it's 75-25 I feel for myself right now. Justin with how I'm feeling, how my training's been going, the progression I've made over the last couple of months and the progression I'm continuing to make.
Matt Mask: I'm seeing especially, it was prior to this interview, I'd say it was a 60-40, but knowing that he's not 100% focused on me right now, and he's focusing on Worlds, and I'm going to be kind of a month, it just shifted to a 75-25. And Sandris? Yeah, because I don't know how I'm going to feel after Worlds, I will give it 70-30%.
Engin Terzi: For now. To Matt? To me? No. Because do you know why I'm messing with you mostly, Sandris? Because you are the calm, quiet one, you understand? While he's already challenging. So I'm just trying to turn you on. Anyways, Sean, your friend, our friend, Sean says, I really like and respect the Latvians. Sorry, the wild horse has to be unleashed.
Engin Terzi: on sundries and and this 1.4 gh whatever engine a canadian horse versus a latvian tank seems like a mismatch matt will need to become the wild tank to compete against sundries yep this is what they are saying great yeah anyway so
Engin Terzi: I thank you very, very much, guys. It is fun. It has been more than one hour. I don't know how it just went through. And hope to see you guys in Istanbul. Over two months. Yeah, only two months. Yes, only two months. And there will be, I think, a good, good press conference. And let's see what you guys will have for the press conference. And Gary Goodrich will be there, Matt. Yeah. Dennis will be there.
Matt Mask: 11 will be there. Alex Kurdes and Gennady will be there as guests. I don't know how every time you put one of these fucking things together, I always say there's no way it's going to get any fucking better. It's impossible. How the fuck is it going to get any better? And then all of a sudden it's like, Jesus fuck. So I'm pretty sure this is probably the pinnacle of what
Engin Terzi: It actually is because I can't see how it's going to get any better than November 19th. But I want you to prove me wrong again. No, I will do my best. I will do my best. I will do my best. I love it. The one thing for sure, like there are probably a million arm wrestling fans and athletes as well. The one that who is enjoying this event the most is me. So that is why I'm doing this.
Engin Terzi: Because I am trying to do something that will excite me more than last time. So that automatically equals more exciting events. But you guys for sure deserve
Engin Terzi: much more much more than this but we will grow all together all together yeah you know we are we are just right now we are not only uh arm wrestlers but we are also all of us ambassadors promoters we are all together promoting arm wrestling and showing to the world that what we are they they they have no clue about us they this is a big iceberg they see only this part
Matt Mask: lot more is hidden for them so all together we're going to show them more more more more and we will grow up yeah i don't think i don't think there's an arm wrestling fan or an armor on this planet that doesn't appreciate what you core sports and everybody else is doing right now just with the push of the sport so yeah i i mean i love it and if they are if they don't appreciate it's because they're jealous and they're pissed off that they weren't able to accomplish what you are right now so but just
Engin Terzi: thank you for your words but just remember one thing i can i mean for me it is like like love trust me i enjoy it like whenever i i have like two two uh blackboards on the wall that calculating everything right here and like you you should see me like i'm putting all the names how would we be this and this and that and that you know like you know like a crazy professor yeah
Matt Mask: Evgeny that alone is just enough to mind fuck somebody, but just everything else that you got to deal with, organizing the athletes, getting everybody down. There's a lot of work that goes into putting on an event, just a regular small local event, never mind what you're orchestrating. Some of us fucking arm wrestlers are high maintenance motherfuckers. I'm sure you know that. But you guys are making this possible. You guys...
Engin Terzi: all our great arm masters and great personalities, you know, and then whenever you even give out your personality and thoughts together with your arm nesting abilities, I mean, it's incredible. It's incredible. Also, as I said many times, it's not like East versus West. In my mind, it is just like East and West that we bring in together because we are one world, you know, one world. Oh, for sure. Well, eventually, eventually you're going to run out of East versus West matches.
Matt Mask: and you're going to have to start having East versus East, some West versus what, like, you know what I mean? So it's... Yeah, yeah, we will come to that point. We will come to that point. Once we get all the matches that everybody's been wanting to see for the last 10, 15 fucking years, then you're going to have to start, you know? Yeah, yeah.
