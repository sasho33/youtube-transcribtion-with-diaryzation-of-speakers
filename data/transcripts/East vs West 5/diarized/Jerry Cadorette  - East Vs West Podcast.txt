Engin Terzi: um mostly about just regenerating uh some things you know just some things are permanently injured no i didn't watch i didn't watch cobra's live stream um ryan bowen i have no idea i don't i have no idea my friend
Engin Terzi: Do I know Cobra is making a comeback? I'm the one who convinced him. You're telling me if I know or what. I mean, I invited him to pull at East versus West. That's why he's making a comeback. I mean, I would pull Cobra, but I don't know if Cobra is planning to pull at that level again. If he is planning, yeah, we could pull, yeah.
Engin Terzi: It's versus West is the best thing to happen to our missing. Thanks for making it happen. You're welcome, my friends. Yeah, there are a lot of people to get. Yeah, cartilage replacement. Yeah, something like that. But is it even possible? Something like this? I don't I have no idea. I don't know if you've if stem cell is doing something similar or arson is Paul.
Unknown: most likely confirmed but i think paul's next match is important you know oh cobra wants he wants to be number one in the world 80 kilo okay then yeah there are a lot of people to pull hello adnan hello my friends
Engin Terzi: Anything is possible. Anything is possible. Jerry told me a few minutes, and it has been 13 minutes. It better come soon. Devon and Prudnik, good match. Which poll results?
Unknown: Yanis wants to compete East versus West. There are countless people who wants to compete in East versus West. 100% Revaz probably next year. Bring in Irina Makeeva, hopefully she would.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I was planning to said Yanis versus Daniel in November, but I asked Yanis, he said he's going to pull up 75 kilo and Daniel is also going to pull the same category. So in four weeks, they are meeting twice. And then the second one is East versus West. I thought it was not a good idea. I don't know. Yanis took, I think what,
Engin Terzi: Third place or fourth place, I think Yanis took at the last horse. First was Zolev. And the second one was Makaro. Third was Emrah from Turkey. And the fourth was Yanis, as far as I remember. I'm not going to do gossip here, my friend. I'm not really interested, you know.
Engin Terzi: I don't know if Travis is going to make a comeback or not. I have no idea. I don't know what's his, um, I have invited Talgat Akdev last year in April. He competed here. He took second place after Bozhidar. Hello, Clayton. Hello, my friends. Yes, Alan and Yannis pulled the same category. Yannis' two losses were against Alan and Arthur Makaro. Both beat Yannis easily.
Unknown: Um, okay. Mighty Darius. Take care of my friends. Um, now Jerry wrote, he said, okay. He just wrote, he said in five minutes he will be here.
Engin Terzi: No, my friend, I don't believe those fellow system point systems to, I mean, in a combat sport, like arm wrestling, just like it is to me with a nonsense system to use in arm wrestling.
Engin Terzi: I don't know. Today I'm focused on Jerry Cadaret and Ermes match. He will be here in a few minutes and we will see. I don't know. It depends, you know, it depends how it will be. Hello, JP. I'm doing fine. I hope you are fine as well.
Engin Terzi: I don't know. I don't know. I mean, Ermes, if he goes a little bit inside and Jerry just curves, he may pin Ermes quick. And if Ermes is very quick, he may go for a flash pin. But if Jerry hits and Ermes topples him, there may be a possibility match to stop somewhere and have a war.
Engin Terzi: Ermes needs more wrist, more side pressure, more horsepower to beat Levan. I don't know. I'm not, I'm not thinking about right now. As I said, I'm mostly focused on Jerry versus Ermes match. And let's see what, yes, Jerry is quick. Ermes is quick. We will see.
Engin Terzi: See, the only thing is that, of course, the last word is said by strength. But, I mean, from now, like right now, we don't know who is stronger. But one thing that Jerry is more experienced against top rollers, all his life he pulled against them.
Engin Terzi: then Ermes is experienced against the deadlifts shoulder pressure guys. So here, Jerry is the one who knows what to do better than Ermes knows what to do. It doesn't mean Ermes cannot win. Ermes may be strong enough and win, but what I'm just saying,
Engin Terzi: If the strength is close, then I think it will be very tough match. All I say is that Jerry is very experienced against top rollers. But just because you are experienced, it doesn't mean that you're going to win. I just say that Jerry has pulled countless types of top rollers last 30 years. While I don't know how many times
Engin Terzi: Ermes has experienced someone like Jerry. So that's all I say. So most likely Jerry knows what to do already while there is a possibility Ermes to make a mistake about his strategy, but it doesn't mean that he will make, like he needs to do his homework very well when he comes there, but maybe it will be too strong. And I mean, it will just win, you know?
Unknown: We don't know. I have no contact with Alex.
Unknown: Thank you. Destroy your arms.
Unknown: what's this the metal beams something guy is talking about are you here to trying to start just go do somewhere else you know we want to talk about our message
Unknown: i mean i would like to i would like to set uh devon versus prudnik match yeah i think but not if michael b is prudnik
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Leonidas. Yeah. Leonidas, in fact, I already invited him. He was, he is, he was waiting for Prudnik match to be, you know, Leonidas is not a like pure arm wrestler, you know, he is doing some other sports. But to, we need to invite
Engin Terzi: uh people like leonidas larry wheels just to introduce arm wrestling to non-arm wrestling uh um sports viewers so that that that is the way to you know make arm wrestling bigger so some people may criticize me you know and you say no you didn't invite this guy but now you're inviting that guy
Engin Terzi: guys, I mean, you are nowhere at the level to be 100% idealistic. Some of you just acting like, you know, I'm talking about very, like 1% 2% people, you know, just acting like, you know, we are in like a perfect condition, perfect level are missing, everything should be so ideal, you know, it is not we are still trying to make our message known by the
Unknown: world who don't know about arm wrestling being an organized you know sports my team jerry has come
Engin Terzi: He's like a what? Bodybuilder or powerlifter, something like that. Hello, Jerry. How are you, my friend? What's up? How is everything? Can't complain. How about you? Your son won the game? Yeah, they won. They kicked their butt. Yeah? That's good. That's good. So...
Engin Terzi: Yeah, guys, just please concentrate on Jerry versus Ermes now. You guys are asking me so many unrelated things, please. So, Jerry, how have you been, my friend? Good. How about you? Normal. Justin finalized the cart and trying to focus on the technical things, you know, how to make the event.
Engin Terzi: look better for the viewers and so i mean so that we will just get better and better as a sport that people from outside when they watch they will have more and more and more respect for us i'm not talking about the the athletes but just you know like those slow motions and the lights and you know what i mean yeah those kind of things i think you did an awesome job on the last one so
Engin Terzi: yeah keep raising the bar so yes yes we need to do more we if if we ever if we ever think that we are like we did great job we are not gonna improve we need to like ignore the like everything good and then focus on the mistakes so the next time will be better and better and better isn't it what we have been doing as an arm master as well like if you if you after 30 years you are if you are still winning at the world level that is because you are also
Engin Terzi: focusing on your mistakes to it's impossible to keep yourself at the high level for 30 years if you didn't really care about your mistakes if you would just i mean today somebody was asking oh wait wait when did jerry won't win you know world championships jerry won 1996 and 2000 wars by easy and probably the guy that who asked me the question probably wasn't even born then you know just all right yeah they yeah
Jerry Cadorette: See, one guy here is asking you to say, Engin! Engin! Yeah. At that time, I didn't realize. I saw that on media later. Yeah, you get caught up in the moment. You're having fun, you're passionate. I think if you don't get fired up, it's not the right sport, right? And the passion is that you want to win, you want to do the best, and you're
Jerry Cadorette: I don't know, you get caught up in the moment and you look back. You put your heart in it, you know, that that's what it is, you know? Yeah. Yeah. You know, and I mean, I'm in it to win it. And you know, if I'm loud, obnoxious, I'm whatever.
Jerry Cadorette: I become a different person when you're going up on that table. And, you know, it's like you, when you were up on that table, you were always driven, right? You were like looking through the dude. And so you know the emotion that you feel and the excitement that you have. The only thing you want is victory, right? So, you know, whatever it takes, I'm in it to win it. And that's it. So it is what it is.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, one guy asked me, Charles Penner, thank you for your support. Jerry, why didn't we see your tongue out with Gennady? I think maybe it was in the last match, but yeah, I don't know. And I'll tell you,
Engin Terzi: It was hot, right? I mean, those lights on that stage, those are hot, right? But you got to get me a bigger shirt, Engin. You got to get me a bigger shirt. I will. See, this guy said that he asked this question. He was born in 91. Yeah, okay. He worn the walls when you were walking with the short, you know, and playing with the sand. Yeah, the guy, you can don't find 2000 WAF. Justin go check 2000 WAF, Virginia Beach. You will find 110 kilo, 242s. You will find his name.
Engin Terzi: yeah it's another education free education for you england's the encyclopedia of arm wrestling yeah they they don't know they don't know because because for from like 2013 around till the pandemic i didn't i was away from the social media so when i come back they are like who's this guy you know so they they they are like i mean when i say something who are you to say in this you know just they they i mean but they don't have
Jerry Cadorette: don't have a clue but yeah our sport it's good that it's growing right but as it grows all types all types of people that are in love with the sport or intrigued by the sport so good bad or indifferent
Engin Terzi: the uh without them there is no sport right there is no growth this guy said what what i remember is jerry match with zolev on zlotin emirov uh do you also remember their super match one-on-one super match and like listen in the overalls everyone can be i beat travis badge and i flashed him in a in a category or super match i could never beat travis
Engin Terzi: But it was overall, I flashed him. He didn't even see his arm. So just, again, educate yourself. But this was the last one that I show your patients. Now, what does it say here? Hide user on this channel. OK. So that we will not lower the IQ level of the chat. Anyway, so. Oh, yeah. Anyway, so yeah, I mean, they, I don't know.
Engin Terzi: listen jerry you may be a fan of one arm wrestling or our master i understand that but like whenever you show him the whole respect in the world they also worship him almost but then then you are disrespectful the rest of the guys that that's the wrong thing to do you know if somebody came to that level i don't know if he's your favorite athlete or not i mean that guy as as an athlete deserves the respect you understand so this whatever
Engin Terzi: anyway so clerks 93 says jerry number one in usa beast yeah there was i you realize how much criticizing you know i i received after i ranked it number two yeah but it again everyone uh everyone has opinions you know they they they they have their own version their own views but um
Jerry Cadorette: are you gonna do right not everyone likes the same person not everyone feels the same way but i know that um gannadi was truly amazing right and uh yeah i would bet money tons of money i would bet on gannadi against anyone below me in levon i would bet tons of money that gannadi beats all those people
Jerry Cadorette: And he already proved it, right? He beat Michael Todd. He beat Dave Chaffee. He has all these wins, right? And I think his loss to Ermes was when he was just recovering from an injury, right? It was his first super match after many years of injury and absence. Right. Yeah. So, whatever. I'm fine.
Engin Terzi: I like your rankings, right? And I agree with them. It always worked that way. It always worked that way. I mean, I don't understand why people, Devon was telling me that, you know, like he was getting angry with the other guys who are making rankings. And then one day he shared something. He said, okay, Engin, you know, where are you? You know, just do, you know, someone with brain, you know, do these rankings, you know? So I made the rankings.
Engin Terzi: But I made the same exact logic. I used the same exact logic when I ranked him number one in the world in 2008. He lost Taras two years ago. He beat John. But he never said that, again, I have a losing record against Taras, so I cannot be ranked above him. But now he's saying that you can't rank above, you know, Dave because you don't have the winning record against. I mean, you don't have to, you know. You're talking about something from five years ago or, you know. My mother...
Engin Terzi: My mother could tell me that you have a bad record against me arm wrestling. Until I was 15, 16, she was beating me. She never arm wrestled with me. So she says that, remember, you never beat me. Right, see? You got a ranker above you. Yeah, she, yeah. Anyways. Yeah, there is chances asking, chances saying that, Jerry, how can you rank
Engin Terzi: number two when i easily beat you to try training no he never said this
Engin Terzi: he doesn't say that but he asked hey are you he's going back to that i thought we established this but he didn't say that i'm just joking he said that what what do you think of michael claiming number one in u.s still and you know okay that question was to me i'm not gonna get involved with that michael said that he agrees with me that you rank number two in the world i think but he said he doesn't agree that you rank number one in u.s this is what he said yeah
Jerry Cadorette: Michael's a true competitor, right? If you cut him, he bleeds arm wrestling. So I think that he never wants to admit that someone's going to be better than him. And I look at it like I love the passion, I love the drive, and I get his concept, but I just beat the guy that he couldn't even get a win on.
Jerry Cadorette: And I practiced with Mike and my last match with Mike, it was a faulty strap. And so we beat that horse till it's dead. And I asked Mike for a match and I went on public record on YouTube and Facebook and everything saying, I didn't believe the top five in the United States or North America. I gave two to one odds.
Jerry Cadorette: against anyone that was ranked above me at that time just so i could get back in the ranking systems and i would go against them for two to one odds whatever money they wanted to put up and uh the only one to call me was devin and he said he loved it but he didn't want to do it because he was training for levon but he's the only one that called me right and me and devin got a great relationship whatever but um so
Jerry Cadorette: Michael turned down the match with me and said I had to go against Chance. Not against Chance, against Corey West. So he is what he is, right? He wants to chase a title. He's good for him. He's going to drop down 250 pounds.
Jerry Cadorette: He didn't he didn't fare so well when he started to gain weight and go up against the heavier guys. I mean, Devon beat him 3-0. Revis beat him 3-0. Gennady beat him. Everyone beat him. So I don't understand how he doesn't see that he was having trouble. Right. And then he just pulled Todd Hutchins and barely beat Todd. Right.
Jerry Cadorette: I'm interested to see his match with Prudnik. I think that's a great matchup that you created. And I think if both of them come in 250 or under, based on the level that Prudnik was when he beat Todd, I never would have picked Prudnik to beat Todd. You know, I'm a huge Todd fan. And I think his side pressure is phenomenal. And for Prudnik to go through it like it wasn't there...
Jerry Cadorette: know is is unbelievable to me and uh knowing that now michael todd's gonna come down to that same weight go against that guy that just smashed todd i i think he's in trouble right i mean do you think his pulling style may be a problem for him or no because even if somebody beats michael usually they're having a hard time to beat him and if you don't know the way to beat him
Jerry Cadorette: you are you there is a possibility you like i mean prudnik needs to do you think prudnik can just go through like nothing or do you think it needs to work i think that michael's gonna go to a king's move go back down and try to catch him right because prudnik's quick you know i i watched him and i was impressed so i think he's gonna get him down but can michael stop him when when they're down that low can michael catch him stop him and hold him
Jerry Cadorette: And if he does, then he'll bleed him. But if Prudnik is smart and watches Michael's tapes and sees how to beat him when he's down in a Kings move, then it's going to be a different story. So it's going to come down to can Michael catch him and hold him from pinning him? And I don't know. At 250 pounds, I think that's going to be a tall feat for Michael to do.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but if he is around 260 is 253 pounds limit. So he can he can be 253 Friday morning and Saturday evening, it can be 260. So what I just tried to say that, I mean, sometimes it is not like you don't necessarily get weaker. I mean, just because you are a little bit lighter. I mean, it depends, you know, I mean, sometimes, yes.
Engin Terzi: like people say that it is not the same michael i'm not saying it's the same michael or not but when when michael years ago when he beat pushkar he was only about 260 118 kilo he was and whenever whenever whenever
Engin Terzi: he said that before the match i asked him he said he's gonna be light for that match i was like are you sure maybe you should gain weight he said no trust me and he he was even lighter you know 118 kilo and he beat he beat him so so sometimes you may be like thinner i mean on the scale but maybe stronger you understand so i don't know if he's really losing so much power when you make down to 260 i don't know
Jerry Cadorette: right now I saw his really his belly everything looks salty arms are to me the same same Michael you know I don't know yeah no I'm I agree with you we'll see I just think he's a he's a defensive puller right yeah being a to puller is that enough weight to withstand prudenix pressure right so I
Engin Terzi: I don't know. I don't know. I'm going to go with it's going to come down to if Michael can hold him and wear him out. But then Prudnik needs to know how to beat him as well, right? Yeah. Yeah, he needs to know if he needs to climb up this and that, yeah.
Jerry Cadorette: Michael's whole thing is he, as he's holding you in that King's move, he's walking his fingers higher and higher and higher. So if he gets into that lock and he's able to sit out there and he's walking his fingers higher and he's gaining advantage, you know, he's going to try to open you up. And if you let him get to that position, it's going to be a long day. Yes, yes, yes. So basically,
Engin Terzi: it may be a tough day if we judge only by looking their matches against Tatachins you would say that Prudnik is favorite when you look at Prudnik versus Tatachins and Michael versus of course last two rounds Michael beat him easy you know with the shoulder pressure but yeah but the round that he went to open arm top rope it didn't look so good for him you know right yeah yeah
Jerry Cadorette: So is he going to try a quick press against Prudnik? I don't think so. I think Prudnik is super strong inside. I think that may, may fair to be a bad move to against Prudnik. But Michael is quick enough to jump in hits. And then while the guy even stops him, the shock, if Michael realized that he cannot win, he quickly goes back to his open arm top roll again from that position.
Engin Terzi: as well there is one super chat cold stone says jerry you need to address michael todd yeah i mean this is what we have been doing right now this is um address them i just addressed them listen yeah yeah yeah yeah i was slow with this on the wasn't on the on the on the video when i first said it
Jerry Cadorette: where was it up the two to one odds where was he when i said anyone in the top five i'll take him on in north america and i'll put up two to one so every dollar they put up i would have put up two they put up five thousand i would have put up ten right so uh no one won again so now i go and do what i was supposed to do in my mind and i beat gnadi who is an absolute beast and uh
Jerry Cadorette: I take over that ranking position, and now I'm on his radar? Well, I don't care, right? To me, he dissed me when I wanted the match. Now he wants the match, he can wait in line, right? Because to me, it wouldn't be a match. I'm going to beat him easy, and it would be a joke, and all it's going to do is screw up my training, right? So he wants to come up and practice pull, and I'll do the same thing that happened when we practiced pull last time.
Engin Terzi: know there is there is chess goals uh he says i made yellow ratings for east all east versus west events yes my friend but we don't give enough of opportunity to every athletes so i think that we don't we are not that big enough to give opportunity to all the elite athletes so
Jerry Cadorette: anyway so i mean it's like an all-star game right you not every player gets to play in the all-star game first off you have to make the all-stars right and once you make the all-stars then you're going to compete against the other all-stars so what you did was you and established you established an all-star event right so everyone that had to be
Jerry Cadorette: really good in order to get in so you have to a prove yourself good enough to get in and get that invite and then once you're there now you have to prove yourself against the other all-stars so everyone have like i said it's like everyone wants to throw their two cents in which is fine let them throw it in but at the end of the day it is what it is and it's it's not going to matter they can throw their two cents in we can comment on it we can talk about it you can do whatever they want
Jerry Cadorette: But the meat is the meat, right? So you got to prove yourself to get in. And then when you get in, if you don't win, you should be dropped back down.
Jerry Cadorette: So Michael lost, Dave lost, right? They lost. They don't get to regain a high position if you lost and you lost. So now you've got to come back and you've got to prove yourself and do better. So coming off of three losses in a row of getting swept,
Jerry Cadorette: You know, you shouldn't be in a position where you should talk about how good you are. You should be in a position of be quiet, go and try to reclaim yourself. You barely beat Todd Hutchins, and now you're already boasting and claiming that you're going to be the best, right? So what about Revis? What about Gennady? What about Dave? What about, I mean, Devon? You know, I mean, all those people beat you, you know, without you even getting a win.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, whenever I set you against Gennady, people criticize me a lot. They are like, how can you just suddenly bring Jerry and put on a title match? I did the same thing when I did Ongarbe versus John. I did the same thing when I just bring Dadikyan suddenly. I mean, like sometimes you use here, right?
Engin Terzi: I brought that again right away. He got the title, right? He beat Oleg Zok. And I brought on my web directly, he beat John, right? So they were not joking, you know, whenever I invited them, you came there and you won, right? Whenever I invited you, they said, how can you bring the guy? I mean, there are some guys that they don't have to prove themselves at the East versus West to start the direct title match. If somehow Evgeny beats Michael,
Engin Terzi: And if Devon comes there, of course, Devon is going to pull for the title directly. He doesn't have to come here and prove like, what are you talking about? Like, I mean, these guys have been, I mean, competing for like forever, you know, decades. You know, you cannot tell them to go prove yourself and come back or something. If the guy is in good form, he says a good form, he knows what he's talking about. I ask you, what's your form? You said, you know, I will be good enough. Yeah. And then people say, how can you give him a title match? I said, don't worry about it.
Engin Terzi: If it is a mismatch, Gennady is going to have the title, right? The one that he deserved. We are not going to lose anything. But if Jerry wins, then it will prove my point, you know, that, I mean, so he came, he won. So that's it, you know, what to do, you know? So, I mean, I'm not going to, Jerry, you need to prove yourself. You didn't prove enough the last 30 years.
Jerry Cadorette: Right. It's crazy, but yeah, that's all right. Like I said, you get a lot of younger people that are in the sport. You know, I was, I was, um,
Jerry Cadorette: basically on a shelf for a couple years i mean i was still arm wrestling and still training but i was on a shelf in a position where there was no good meats up near me and uh i put the challenge out there no one wanted it and i felt as though you know my level i was ready and i wanted to prove myself and then you gave me the opportunity so i made sure to train and go against him and uh prove to everyone that
Jerry Cadorette: what what i said right i said i was gonna win i said i was gonna be a war i said that i expected it to be a real battle and a true test and didn't want to win on fouls didn't want to lose on fouls and i wanted the strongest person to win strongest person won right and uh i definitely was
Engin Terzi: was everything i thought it was going to be it was it was that it was that difficult it was tough i think i think that every american should be very proud of you i mean the other americans they also came and battled like crazy like michael lost two matches right but but he fought till the death it both against gennady and against revas they were no way easy matches they were war they lost as well dave chappie also lost but he
Engin Terzi: like two three you know the score is just very close a little bit more a little bit more they could have won you understand so there was no way that like they performed bad you know they were good but you came you won so also i think that it doesn't matter who is even if it is your toughest opponent from united states they all should be proud of you this is my opinion
Engin Terzi: know super heavyweight coming there and then winning the most important title i said most important because as we know the super heavyweight always weighs heavier if we if king of the table did the best 70 kilo super match in the history i don't think it would take the same attention as the devon versus levan so that that is the fight we are as an arm wrestling we are not there yet while conor mcgregor and hubby would take so much attention because those are i mean
Jerry Cadorette: I mean, more advanced. No, I agree. I think I'm shocked the most is when a North American rules in and goes almost against me because the way I look at it, we sent over Dave.
Jerry Cadorette: And he didn't win. We sent over Michael. He didn't win. So I was like the last hope, right? And I went over there knowing that had I lost, that this guy just wiped out North America. Yeah, he beat first Michael, and then he beat Dave, and then you were the third one, yeah. And then who was left then?
Engin Terzi: if he would beat you as well as a super heavyweight i think that there is no one left i'm from america north america not north america because there is devon there but in united states of america i think you michael and dave is there anyone i'm missing or no no tim tim used to be up there but i don't know what's happened to him lately but
Jerry Cadorette: But I have zero losses to Tim. I would like to see Travis get back into it and take it for real. But I understand he's all caught up in his kid's football too. And, you know, I would be too if my kid was number one in the country. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There is one super chat. Ziggy or what's that? I can help with cuts. Thank you for your super chat.
Jerry Cadorette: will levan compete against the winner of jerry versus hermes in my opinion yes in my opinion yes that's what i want right and uh i'm looking at this next match with army's uh armies right the uh yeah armies but uh i'm looking at that match as
Jerry Cadorette: uh, almost like a speed bump. Right. And, uh, where I got to, to, to, to take it, to be qualified for level. Right. Right. So, I mean, the speed bump that is in the way of getting from here to LaVon, right. So you gotta go over that speed bump first. So I'm gonna drop a little meme. That's gonna be a speed bump with armies, his face, right. And, um, but I, I know that if I train for a LaVon, I have to put on more.
Jerry Cadorette: I have to get stronger, you know, because this version, the version of me that showed up against Gennady would not have beat LeBron. I know that. But that wasn't who I was training for, right? And then it wasn't...
Jerry Cadorette: It wasn't there yet. So now this version of me needs to transform into a version of me. That's going to be prepared to take all of them. Right. And cause I want to go into that match, uh, completely different than I've ever been. Right. I want to see a version of me that I've never seen, see a version of me that no one's ever seen. So I got to transform me from here to get up to here. Right. Is it possible Jenny?
Jerry Cadorette: yeah to get there the the problem ain't gonna exist right so unlike lavon i work a job at home here right 60 hours a week 55 60 hours a week and then i have a bunch of little kids right so uh when i come home my
Jerry Cadorette: I should be going to a gym and instead I have a gym at my house to try to incorporate better time scheduling. But when I come home, the kids are excited to see me. So I can't just get away from them and say, hey, leave me alone. I want to go train. So I go and play with them. You're tired and then your training pays a toll, right? So I'm not in a position where I could train all day or train during the day while I'm at work.
Jerry Cadorette: so now it's about balance for me so balance being a regular dude that has a job that takes care of a family that supports a household i mean i even have an in-law where i take care of my parents right so um i look at it like family is first and then uh arm wrestling is second right so now i have to be able to
Jerry Cadorette: with LaVon, I have to almost tweak or find a better schedule. So maybe it's one where I go to bed earlier at night, I train in the morning, right? Or train some in the morning and then some at night so I can balance out my day and get a better workout. I've asked, the wife is on board and she's gonna help me and we're gonna,
Jerry Cadorette: bring this uh you know bring this to a new level and uh they're excited because i want i know that i want it right i know that i'm going to chase it i'm going to go after it and prove all the people out there that you know want to root against me or whatever it's okay continue to root against me it doesn't matter you know i'm not doing it for you i'm doing it for me right and the people that support me those are the ones that i appreciate the other ones are just you
Jerry Cadorette: It's like putting gas on a fire, right? So you're going to say, okay, he can't do it. He can't do this. He can't do that. I've always, you know, I've done my whole life proving people wrong.
Jerry Cadorette: I think that that just is more motivational, right? So you get people that say, oh, there's no way he's going to get smoked zero to six. Great. So whenever I go over there and whatever I do is going to be, you know, I've got nothing to lose then, right? I've got everything to gain. That's been the history of me, right? So when I went to Travis for 15,000 bucks of our own money,
Jerry Cadorette: You know, that was the same thing. Everyone picked him because I had just come off a two-year back surgery, which put me out. And then it was easy. Once you got out, it was easy to just stay out because once you become lazy, it's so easy to stay lazy. But it doesn't take the passion out of your mind, right? Because you're still thinking about it. You're still dreaming about it. You still know where you should be.
Jerry Cadorette: it's just the work ethic you know you didn't put the work ethic in because it was easy to not go to the gym it was easy to you know get sidetracked and then get consumed with work and you know whatever but my uh my mindset's changing and uh you know i'm driven i'm pushed and uh i want to prove not only to me but to my family
Jerry Cadorette: and to all my people that support me, that we can do this, right? We can go out there and we can take on LeVon and beat someone that hasn't been beaten in a long time, right?
Jerry Cadorette: whether I win, lose, or draw, the best version of me will be on that table. And I know that it will be a war. There will be no quick, easy pins. There will be nothing, right? Because my passion and my drive is too strong, right? And my will to want to win is too strong. So I'm willing to, you know, do whatever it takes to get on that table and take the victory. Yeah, the thing is that if anyone,
Engin Terzi: pulls Levan, I don't think that any organizer is gonna put someone who don't deserve to pull against Levan. And anyone who deserves to pull Levan and he loses. I mean, even like, I'm not saying that people will lose, but people needs to understand that it is not a shame
Engin Terzi: to stand up and then do your best against this guy, you know, you understand? I don't think that anyone has anything to lose against this guy, but a whole world to win, you understand? Like, I mean, like, like, the guy is just monster. If you beat him, I mean, it's something incredible. If you lose him, lose against him, there is nothing to be ashamed. You know, some people are ready to make fun and, you know,
Engin Terzi: Like, I mean, I don't understand that part. I don't understand. I think that we really need to show respect to those people who are good enough to reach to that level. You know, having respect for a person's like character, personality is a different thing, but as an athlete, all these athletes, they deserve respect. I don't think that someone
Engin Terzi: anyone should make fun with with them when they lose or something i don't understand that part like anyway so so basically you are saying that basically you are saying that um you will do your best you will get ready and you win or lose time will show but but how do you see your chance against hermes uh
Jerry Cadorette: think it's going to be a greater chance of me winning than i had against gavadi right because jeremy's isn't going to go inside he's going to go outside and when he goes outside to me that's the lane that i want right because when he goes this way i'm going this way and uh i think you know he's obviously he's quick and he's fast i've seen him but um i don't think
Jerry Cadorette: I don't think it's going to be as difficult as it was against Gennady. I think he knows that. And for him saying he's at 85% right now,
Jerry Cadorette: And he better be talking about a scale of up to 200 then, right? Because if he's only going to increase by 15%, it's not going to be enough, right? So he better get ridiculously strong. He better get ridiculously better, right? Because I don't plan on coming in. I plan on coming in way better than I was against Gennady. In the version of me that Gennady, I know beats...
Jerry Cadorette: armies right so um i and i think armies can say whatever he wants and he can say oh he's got a weak wrist he's got a weak wrist it's it's not a weak wrist it's i don't mind giving up my wrist right but that'd be like me saying he's got a weak bicep right he ain't gonna go into a hook and he ain't gonna go inside
Jerry Cadorette: we'll have a replay of match three with Gennady. And then I just look at it as if I'm comfortable with my wrist bent back, right? So I envision we go, we slip, we get put in straps, and then it's lights out for Ermes, right? Because he's going to hit, he's going to try to take my wrist, but I'm going to give it to him. And then I get behind it, and then he's not strong enough to take my upper body strength and my weight
Jerry Cadorette: to the path. There's no way. I saw him, right? And I've seen him compete and he had trouble with Matt Mask. And I think that it's okay. I mean, you know what though? I absolutely love the dude, right? And I think he's an awesome puller. I just don't think there's any way that I lose on the table, right? And I'm still going to buy him a drink after I beat him.
Engin Terzi: You said something similar to Gennady before the match. You said you're going to allow him to touch your shield or something. You remember before the match you were saying, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Pitch it with it, you know, so you can tell people you can hold it. Yeah. Whenever you... What's that? I said, I'll do the same thing with Ermes. I'll let him take a picture with the helmet on.
Engin Terzi: At least he can show his fans in Italy that, hey, this is what it would have looked like if I had won. I understand. You described, you know, Ermes top roll like this, and then you will go like that. How about if he doesn't do top roll by making his downside of your hand,
Engin Terzi: out like this. But what if he attacks from here, directed to this side and takes you away from your shoulder? Does it does it concern you?
Jerry Cadorette: i i know what you're saying but you know what i mean like i'm not going to allow myself i'm not going to allow myself my wrist to get put on this side of my shoulder if my wrist gets put on this side of my shoulder i have to move right because obviously that'll be uncomfortable for me and i would have to switch positions if he does if he doesn't go defensive top row but offensive
Jerry Cadorette: outside move to do the other shoulder yeah this is what it is if he's going to try to take my my hand with a lower lower grip i think i think i can force it inside
Jerry Cadorette: If he doesn't have the balls, I don't think he's gonna have the balls to go that low because then I can force that match inside. His only way of doing it is to come out of my fingers, right? And to come out of my fingers, if you give me too much fingers around the top and you're gonna grab inside, I can force that match inside.
Jerry Cadorette: um so everyone that goes against me they they think they have a game plan before they go and then what happens right it's all up right so um when he goes with me he's gonna have to stay high because he's have to come out on my fingers if he goes too low right he doesn't need to go low you know he can still hold high but instead of doing this he can go this like to the left left shoulder directly just to take your hand right away you know
Jerry Cadorette: from shoulder not not like this way there so you can push but what if he goes to this way you know what i mean or not i i know what you mean yeah he's not going to be able to take he's not going to be able to separate my right my right wrist
Jerry Cadorette: He's not going to be able to separate it over here. I worked too hard at keeping the two together, right? So the first match with Gennady, I allowed myself to get too open and then on the other side, right? Because Gennady hit and then hit and hit again. And I waited until after his hit, I was going to press and I timed it all fucked up and I let my hand get too open.
Jerry Cadorette: So that's what I adjusted. The second match was better, better finger strength. So my hand wouldn't get so like I wouldn't go from here to here. Right. So I stay in tighter. So I wouldn't have such big separation. And that's the same thing that I'm going to have to do with armies because he's I'm telling you, his first move is going to be elbow to the back of the pad. And then he's going to come trying to roll me over.
Jerry Cadorette: I would love if he tries to go through me in the center because that's gonna keep me at my strongest point. My strongest point is obviously closer. Everyone wants to separate my hand from my shoulder, right? And if I stay in tight, I can't lose, but we'll see. I mean, I'll be ready, no, until the first match, right? I mean, I try to prepare for a few different scenarios, but
Jerry Cadorette: All I can do is go in the strongest that I can be and then adapt to whatever I need to do to win. And I'll know the minute he grabs my hand, uh, where I feel like my lane's going to be. And, uh, once, once he grabs me and once we set up, uh, I'll
Jerry Cadorette: it'll come to it'll come to light to me that okay my lane is here boom and uh or all right he's gonna he's he's grabbing a little lower he's getting a little higher you know i feel pressure where is it at and i'll go i know he's quick so i'm gonna be ready for go i'll be able to stop at any hit that he's going to be able to give and uh i need to be able to block stop and impress so my my opinion was that anyone who is staying here and you put in your shoulder
Engin Terzi: is like in trouble most of the times when you catch them right there on on the brachii radialis so i was thinking that somebody needs to pull you not the center to the side way but the center more with pronation to this way and then bring your shoulder and pressing your bicep so this is what i was thinking that you know hermes would try but you are saying that it is harder to are the harder thing to do is what you are saying
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Another question. Do you think that compared to Ghana, the match, do you think that you will be stronger, like 5%, 10% possibly stronger than the last match? Because you have now two and a half months, whenever I offer you that match, you know, it was after East versus West three. So even from East versus West three, the day to the East versus West four days, two and a half months, exactly. Two and a half months.
Engin Terzi: And I ask you probably three, four days after. So with the rest day, if you just rested for just say like 10 days, so you only had two months to train, seriously. You had two months to train, right? Right. Now from East versus West four to East versus West five, it is three and a half months.
Engin Terzi: And the match was set already, even when you were there. So you have even longer time, and you are still making a comeback. So how much do you think like, you can get better in such time? My plan is, let's say, and this is 100% real, right? Yeah. Like not be blowing smoke and saying shit, whatever. Let's say
Jerry Cadorette: to get ready for Gennady, I think better than I've ever trained, right? To get there, right? Quarter amount of time. But remember, I think,
Jerry Cadorette: that was about 40 40 of what i can be right because when i say i trained better than i ever trained before i used to never train right i would just go arm wrestle lift weights whatever just around and my workouts would be 20 to 30 minutes and i'd be done for the day right and uh now you have more serious
Jerry Cadorette: serious uh Target right right so now there's more on the line so now I want to push myself much harder and now the wife and the kids and everyone are supporting me and pushing me to do it so if you saw me against Gennady and that was about 40 percent of where I where I think I I could get to right forty percent of what I think would be a hundred percent Max
Jerry Cadorette: that 40 now for armies i want to get myself to be like 70 75 and uh if i if i go to 70 75 percent um then uh you're talking about seeing someone that's probably close to double right of what i just was at armies i mean for agnati right from when i go against armies
Engin Terzi: and uh that's not going to be good for armies right so my question is when you say 100 i i would strongly disagree that you were 40 that your best shape in your entire life but you are saying that 40 of what you could be if you would really train all your career long so that 100 you're planning to reach
Engin Terzi: if you pass hermes for the levan yes okay so but you are saying that you will be minimum you are saying according to you minimum 50 stronger than last time you met gennady yes because if it is 40 just say 60 it will be 50 more than uh 40 like if 40 is one whole it's 50 is
Engin Terzi: so you are saying that you will be much stronger when you meet hermes way stronger way stronger and way better wow you know whenever you talk like this and then even you were talking like this uh before getting the match most of the people didn't take you seriously and and and they didn't take seriously and now they are admitting that okay
Engin Terzi: I admit that I was one of them that didn't take Jerry seriously at all. And I also personally thought that Gennady was favored against you. When we talked, you asked my opinion. I said, you need to be quick enough and catch him on his brachioradialis. And then that was your chance to beat him. And that is the way that you won. Except the one round that he little bit tried to go inside. It was even worse. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: But Gennady also believes that he deserves to win against you. And at one point, he wants to pull you again. Yeah. Well, let's worry about Aramis next. Someday, you say that that match may happen, but not now. Not anytime soon, you are saying. Yeah, I don't.
Engin Terzi: I'm not against the match happening down the road, but I'm not doing that match again before Levan, right? Of course. Of course. I understand. So you're, you're, you're right now, the only thing you focus is beating Ermes and then facing Levan and yeah. Yeah.
Jerry Cadorette: I mean, really surprised for me. What? Listen, this is my mindset. 100% is I'm training the road to Levant, right? The road. So in the way of that trip to Levant, the train will stop for a quick bus stop, like a little speed bump. That's going to be armies and then carry straight on to Levant. So if I'm training for my destination to be Levant,
Engin Terzi: right armies is in the way right so we stop have a drink with him beat him buy him another drink send him back to italy and then i'm on to levan okay i have a question when when you when you say these kind of things if i were your opponent if i was your opponent when you say that you will be minimum 50 stronger than when you met kennedy like if i was your opponent he would like
Engin Terzi: There are two things. One, I would be intimidated. You would get in my mind and I would be either scared or I would. This would make me take you in more seriously and would make me to push my limits even more.
Engin Terzi: Do you have any intention when you say these kind of things? Like, even if it is true what you are saying, some people agree, some people doesn't agree, it doesn't matter. But whenever you say this kind of thing, like, do you think that maybe it is not a good idea to say these kind of things that, you know, it's gonna make Ermes even prepare harder and harder and harder, or is this what you want? Let him bring his best.
Jerry Cadorette: Listen, Engin, I'm never someone that wants to go against someone that sucks, right? I want to go against the best version of everyone. To be the best, you got to beat the best. Remember that, right? To be the best, you have to beat the best. I want the best version of armies to show up that day. How old is he? 28? I think 30. I think around, yeah.
Jerry Cadorette: probably maybe what 29 30 30 i think yeah i i don't know i think he's in his late 20s but also i want the best version of that aramis to show up at that contest in november so you can say i beat the best armies right and then i think that he's got substantially
Jerry Cadorette: uh you know a long career in this sport and i think you know he'll bring his game up and up and up and if i'm the reason he's able to elevate his game a little bit great but i promise if that army's that was there that day is the one that shows up he didn't he shouldn't get on the plane don't get on the plane don't show up don't go up on that table
Jerry Cadorette: because there's no way that version of Ermes is going to win, right? So I'll still buy that version some drinks and some whatever, but I want the best Ermes ever, right? I want an Ermes that Ermes hasn't seen. So you are saying that the best Ermes till now that we saw, he shouldn't get in the plane. He should be much better Ermes or you say that he will regret it?
Jerry Cadorette: oh no yeah he he will definitely he's underestimated underestimating me if he's saying that right and thinks that you know him at 85 that's what he's at now and he could beat me right now he's doing it but he didn't say that he didn't say that many many people misunderstood what he said about this one
Engin Terzi: He didn't say that he is going to come there 85%. Some people said that Ermes is making excuses for his possible loss, that he's 85%, he will come there 85%. Ermes doesn't say that. Ermes said he is 85% now, but he will come there 100% for sure. But he said that even 85% he is in now,
Engin Terzi: is enough to beat you and then i asked him a question so why would you be 100 if 85 is enough and then he said just to be just to make sure that you know there will not be any uh accident on the way so so yeah what were you saying sorry i cut you no i i'm just saying is that him saying that that 85 that he's at 85 and that 85 would beat me
Jerry Cadorette: no that's that's not even no he's insane he's bumped his head i think he's jeep drinking that cheap italian wine and uh he's gotta stop that don't do anything but go to the gym go to the gym and arm wrestle go to the gym and arm wrestle go to the gym and arm wrestle stop talking to people stop doing anything just train so when you get up the train right when it comes in to turkey
Jerry Cadorette: know i want to make sure that the person that gets off that train the armies is a beast i want a beast if yeah if he don't get off turn around go home wow wow uh chess goals he thank for your super chat he says how does jerry rate sundries on right hand
Jerry Cadorette: Sandris, listen, he's strong. I mean, I was, obviously I was beat up after going against Gennady and I was doing after pulling and having fun, but I was drunk, right? It's after pull, it's after pull. I don't know why people, yeah, yeah, I mean. I don't care because I was playing, right? So I pulled him over a few times and then I let him get on me and I let him pull me over.
Jerry Cadorette: thinking that I could just pull him with a mistake. I couldn't pull him back after he got to his position because I was beat. But I was doing it playfully because the wife said that he looked like her ex-boyfriend, right? So I was like, yeah. And so he knew it, but I don't care, right? He's a good guy, right? And I, he was, he's fine, right? So I don't take any of those matches seriously, you know, just people are just,
Jerry Cadorette: I mean, you had the war with Gennady. You were probably totally drunk. I was definitely drunk. You heard me talking on the thing. And I should be smarter when I'm that, like drinking, and then I got drunk, that everyone has a phone, right? And I'm like, oh, so whatever. I mean, I just like whenever people are making conclusion with those afterpulls,
Engin Terzi: just i mean yeah okay it's good fun but that's all you know that's all i mean i mean yeah whatever anyway so it's it's good it's good that you know you have such a like like the things that i heard from you right now just made me how to say think that there will be a big war
Engin Terzi: big war and I'm not going to doubt what you are saying. I'm not saying that Ermes cannot win. I'm not saying you cannot win. I mean, but it sounds like there will be a war. I mean, if you are coming there in the way that you just described 10 minutes ago, then I'm sure that Ermes is also gonna come there with an incredible shape. And I think there will be a war and whoever wins,
Engin Terzi: wow, we'll really deserve to pull against Levan. Again, I mean, you may pull Levan, you may beat him, you may not beat him. You are for sure underdog, but there is nothing. Somebody wrote that, you know, if you are pulling Levan, you need to give your best. Nobody would just go there without reaching his best ever. It's everybody's dream, you know? Like look at Jerry, you know, what he's planning to be. He's planning to be like more than double
Engin Terzi: you know, or performance that he show against Kennedy to meet Levan. And then Ermes says that he needs to be like 110, 120% of his best, you know, to beat Levan. So nobody is going there just to lay down and just take the money or something. These people, they have honor. They have integrity. Evgeny to question, you know, this is just I mean, come on. I agree.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, of course. I mean, just like you, you, nobody is like gonna sell the dreams. I mean, you have, you have your dreams, Jerry, and I'm sure that is more, more, more important than money. Of course, if you make some money is good, but you are not doing it for money. We are not like boxers or UFC fighters who get millions of dollars or something. I mean, yeah. And, and, but also,
Engin Terzi: Like you said, it is very hard for you. You have a job that long, you know, working hours, and then you come home, you have children to, you know, spend time together and everything. But from other side, I'm also thinking that how to say, like, if you are a special person, if you are one of those kind that, you know, like in the world is just showed with, you know, finger, you understand?
Engin Terzi: like could do something i mean like i mean in this life you need like to be able to do something extraordinary you understand it's also fun you know it's just like i mean it's i mean otherwise the life would be boring listen i'm i know this i'm gonna make sure that people see me
Jerry Cadorette: Yeah. Here rather than here. They see me up here because this is our legacy, right? So what we do is our legacy and it leaves it on to the next generation and whatnot. So I'm gonna make sure that I've upped that bar because I've set it up super high and my goal is to surpass it, right? So better set the goal low and hitting it than to set the goal super high
Jerry Cadorette: And if you just miss, then it's okay. Cause you set it up there, right? Then hitting it down here. So it just, just what you'll see the road on the way, right? We'll get along the way and you'll see the transformation.
Jerry Cadorette: You're going to see the strength. You're going to see the better version of Jerry, the bigger version, the stronger version. And I don't think I look that bad right now, right? But I'm going to get bigger. I'm going to get stronger. You'll see it along the way. And Ermes is going to see it. He's going to say, oh, fuck, right? And he's going to be like, he's for real, right? But him, telling him ahead of time, just remember we said this.
Jerry Cadorette: Three months before the meet, I told him, get in shape. You are not in shape. So get stronger, get better, get amazing. So we can make this match memorable. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I always wanted to ask you, are you originally French or something? Your last name? French, yeah.
Engin Terzi: yeah i i i many years i thought he was italian or something but then somebody told me no it is a french uh name last name yeah yeah there is ricard yanson thank you for your support jerry do you think flow pressing pressing makes one's cup wrist weaker long term also push training tips
Engin Terzi: Like doing this all the time makes your wrist weaker, he is saying.
Jerry Cadorette: no i think it becomes uh almost like a natural reflex so i look at it like if we're starting straight right and then i go to jump in my what i want to do is i want to jump in like this right if someone's taking my hand i feel like my motion if i still pushing here the difference from being here to being here
Jerry Cadorette: it's got to be 10 degrees right angle right from here 10 degrees so if i've got this 10 degrees and my shoulders on it i'm okay with my hand bent back right so the people that come out on my fingers that i'm allowed i'm allowing that to happen believe me would rather be inside which was like match three with ghanadi so contrary to what people think
Jerry Cadorette: you still have to have strong fingers right to do the to do the pressing because the idea is you still have to hold on up here yeah with the if my wrist is back if you go too far up here it now makes it impossible to pin them right so when you want to intercept you need that grip right even instead you need that grip yeah so that they cannot climb up on your hand yeah
Jerry Cadorette: right because if they go too high and your wrist is down here and your wrist is now below the pad well look the other person's hand is up above the pad so you'd have to bring them below almost like you have to touch the table to get the win I want to make so that I keep my fingers locked up here so my finger lock is strong right it's just like give up go for the press yeah
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I have a question to go inside or to do properties, do you decide that whenever you realize that you cannot cop the guy and then. Then, then you directly dive without the risk or you in any way try to get him in and at the last moment you do this or you decide you realize that before the goal.
Jerry Cadorette: no when when we're setting up and we're getting ready for the go i i'm ready to go inside but yeah if their first move is the elbow comes to the back of the pad yeah right and they're sweeping out then rather than me going and opening my arm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: I'd rather stay in tight and then I'll just give up the wrist and go press. Yeah. And then hold your body and tricep is pressing over this brachioradialis right here. This muscle here. Yeah. I understand. But I always thought that, you know, whenever you do flop wrist, you needed your pronator because if you don't have the pronator, if your palm is turned that way, your tricep is working to the losing side. To make it to work the winning side, you need to have this pronator.
Engin Terzi: to tricep forwards. But you said that you go in in a spinated way. If they take your wrist, then you continue. How is it possible to, if you are spinated and then your wrist is taking now, your palm is looking up and then the tricep is working to this way, not the weaning. You need to have a little bit here so that you can
Engin Terzi: press so don't you think that your pronator is important i mean i am asking you because this is you are the specialist of this there is no way that i can argue about this with you if in last 30 years if you ask like who is the best top roller
Jerry Cadorette: you can have 20 different names from people but if you talk about the flop risk pressure like 100 person you ask 100 answers jerry catterett so you are the man so just i am asking just to learn from you yeah and to answer your question there's no real real easy answer it's yeah i could be going in but as they go out it's almost one fluid motion for me right that as i go in
Jerry Cadorette: if if they turn with me then it's game over yeah it's game over for them right but if they don't turn with me and they go out then i just it's i'm still going down and then it's almost like my hand goes the other way right and then that's why as i'm pressing i'll never press to the pin pad yeah yeah yeah one motion and that motion is diving in then my hand gets opened
Jerry Cadorette: And you're right, to be effective, your wrist needs to be. So as you're doing it, it's now no longer pinning to the peg. It's pinning to the side of the table, right? Because that's the direction that your hand is going in. The question is, do you try to protect your pronator when you do that movement? Or do you train your pronator just to make sure that you stay like this?
Engin Terzi: or when you do this pressure your pronator does it train because i am very experienced about use of pronation but that that is the only way that i haven't used my pronator you understand like that does your promoter working when you press that way i i don't know about it because i don't do that this shoulder pressure or do you separate the train your pronator in the gym or
Jerry Cadorette: i i train in both ways right so yeah i've got the bands in the in the tubes right that that i can i can pull with the with the fat grip handle right and i can do it in both motions okay so but but for sure when you press with that wrist you need to have your pronator right it shouldn't be turned that way
Engin Terzi: right i prefer to have it correct yeah yeah yeah to to apply max tricep to the winning side yeah i understand yeah yeah that that point if the guy doesn't do only fully pronation what if he gets you in with the pronator
Engin Terzi: make your palm like this and then pronate out that that could be dangerous for you probably yeah but you just said then pronate out once he pronates out there's my lane again yeah but does he have to do full pronation what if he just stays here and then also rescores and rolls you instead of fully pronation out like like the the the way that they they're
Engin Terzi: in the past rhombus john they they blocked you a little bit with their supernatant but i'm sure that from that time you are you also learn learn something you probably fix it ron has one win on me in his life one win i understand but that was the way to do it yeah that way and then the same event john also did it but what i just tried to say is this at that time maybe that was the way but i'm sure that you also did something for it and then
Jerry Cadorette: make sure that it doesn't happen again no and you got to remember i just said my hand is much stronger than people think you know and uh they may think oh jerry has a weak wrist so we can but i can assure you i can sit there and hold myself up
Jerry Cadorette: at, you know, with just my fingertips on a, on a, on a pull-up for a minute and a half at 90 degrees, I'm 330 pounds, right? And if I'm holding myself with just my hand and my fingers, and then I do 120 pound wrist curls, right? All day, all day. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Somebody said that sounds like English training for an engine Jerry match. No, because because, you know, I also, I'm also good about top rolling people. And often I also had to pull against the people with that risk. So that that is you need to be ready for. Yeah, I was saying before you came here to this program, I was telling you guys that
Engin Terzi: like for sure i don't know who's gonna win the match but for sure jerry is more experienced against all kind of top rollers than hermes's experience against that this shoulder pressure someone like jerry you know what i mean yeah because all your life you have dealt with the top rollers all your life that that is i i don't think that you have seen any kind of top roll you know different type of top roll
Engin Terzi: Jerry, uh, Ermes may be stronger in points, but the top role is topple. Of course, maybe he has better cup. I don't know, but I don't know how many times Ermes met someone like you. So that's why I said he needs to do his homework very well. Yeah. And let me ask you, right. You've been around a long time. Do you think that.
Jerry Cadorette: a hundred percent armies right armies whatever yeah right armies do you think that that version of armies would be competitive against travis when i beat travis you you wanna hear the opinion
Engin Terzi: i'm asking you your opinion you may not you may not like my my answer but uh it's different thing you know that's top role versus top role you are like you think that his top role and his ability would be comparable to what travis was in 06 in my opinion yes sorry but you think
Engin Terzi: the guy is i mean listen uh to topple your wrist he doesn't have to be superman you understand no because if you realize no the problem is the problem is after top rolling you the problem starts there the finishing part yeah so top rolling you i have seen people top roll you probably 50 times but that that has never been the
Engin Terzi: like answer top rolling jerry i can top all jerry oh good for you then then what then what gannady top rule you of course he won two rounds but i mean so it's not the solution so i don't really care travis's top reliability versus ms top rule able to both would topple you the problem is to finishing you after that point so the only thing is that hermes has this if he gets a position
Engin Terzi: while Travis was just only hanging, hanging, hanging, hanging, you know, back there, you know, and still going like this. So usually that's because Travis, when he top rolled people, he beats them. But when you pull against someone like you, top rolling him, I mean, so what? I mean, it's not the solution, you know. The solution is what you can do after the point. So if you ask me, if Ermes is
Engin Terzi: more well-rounded to finish someone like you then travis sorry but yes hermes is more well he can train more he can bring shoulder just watch his match against uh michael todd then then you will see but again you are saying that you will come there with with incredible shape so i think that i don't think it is all about the math or chess game i think the last word will be said by the power
Engin Terzi: your power versus his power, then we will see. I think he knows what to do, and you for sure know what to do. 30 years of experience, you pull people like Gary Goodrich, you pull John, you pull Michael Todd, you pull Devon Larratt, you pull Travis, you pull all kind of people. You have losses, you have wins, but I don't think anyone is more experienced than you are. When we talk about anyone who is pulling against this shoulder pressure, I mean,
Engin Terzi: everyone you you meet all kind of top rollers but hermes has never met someone like you that that that is the thing you know but if he is strong enough he can win if you if you are strong enough you're gonna win i i don't know i cannot judge the power because now you are telling me if you are 40 there you will come there minimum 60 70. so then that that is something serious because hermes is already in good shape he is talking about making his 85
Engin Terzi: hundreds which is probably about 15 maybe you understand 15 is planning to get better when i say 50 of course between 85 and 100 is 15 i'm just trying to calculate 15 out of 85 is was that 20 and then yeah it was 17 or something is getting while you're talking about getting 50 better than
Engin Terzi: your previous match so i mean that that that is serious number if you can really do what you are saying then let's see i can wait you'll see yeah you will see yeah i mean yeah i mean if you like and and when you talk like this uh people should take you seriously because you just prove something very
Engin Terzi: importance by beating Gennady let's accept you may be a fan of Jerry or you may not be a fan of Jerry but let's accept that this guy after two and a half years near three years he just came and showed an incredible performance let's accept this guys and Gennady was in incredible shape and he was still picking you know he beat Michael Todd he beat Dave and
Engin Terzi: Now Jerry came and won against him. Justin show him the respect. If he says, I don't know if he can win or not, but if he's saying that he's going to come with a shape that we have never seen before, I mean, I believe him. I believe him. Let's see how it will be. And, and other than that, other than that, just a few question on a short, how do you see Revaz versus Morozov match?
Engin Terzi: I think that's an awesome matchup. I think they're both, I think they're both beast. Right. But, um, I think, uh, Mask off is gonna win. Do you think Morozov is gonna win with a top role or do you think he may, he may try a hook and beat him? I think, um, no, I think he's gonna stop him and I think he's gonna bring him down to the hook. Hook. Yeah. So if, if they go both top role versus top role, Revaz may have the edge or.
Engin Terzi: yes yeah see that that that is another thing morozo has been training non-stop like crazy and he is in great shape and i i think that he will prove he will improve but his improvement will be like this while revas has been away since 2018 and he's he said that first time in his life he's taken our message this seriously
Engin Terzi: So I think his improvement will be like this. You understand what I mean? So I think that he's improving. Like if Morozov will be 5% stronger than last time, my opinion, Revaz will be 15% stronger than last time. Yeah, so that is my point. And you are saying that you're giving the edge to Prudnik against Michael? Yes. Yeah?
Engin Terzi: at a 250 weight class yes 253 yeah yeah i understand yeah anyway so i mean hope to see you very soon get ready i know i know i know you know what to do i mean nobody should ever question
Engin Terzi: what you know about arm wrestling nobody could argue with you about what you are doing at the table i mean one needs to be very very ignorant like really high level ignorant to uh argue about what you know about the way that you pull i don't think anyone close yeah and you know what the day before no two days before you were there right when we went to the girl in place yeah yeah yeah see john came
Engin Terzi: outside you guys were inside because we came late we had to see the outside he came and i was like john do you think jerry has chance he said yeah he said especially if gennady goes outside like this he said he is in deep deep deep trouble and i was like do you really believe what you say he said yeah and you will see just wait two days and you will see and now then after what i saw then probably everyone agrees that you are a real deal my friends real deal
Engin Terzi: Yeah. So anyway, so you want to say anything more before we close?
Jerry Cadorette: Uh, just, uh, I, I appreciate it. You, you put together an awesome event and, uh, I'm definitely looking excited to the next one. I can't believe how outdoing yourself hats off to you. And, uh, all the, all the fans that are out there should really realize that this has never been done before to have this level of an all-star match. And I said it in the press conference that it was absolutely unbelievable to have that much talent in one room.
Jerry Cadorette: in that card that you put together that's phenomenal right so i don't know how you do it but just keep it up because you love love my friend love love how i do is love i love it i mean i didn't mean i didn't mean for many years people are just they had wal there and they had pal there
Engin Terzi: this guy the fans were saying our guys are better these guys were saying our guys better you know of course they better decide some has better decide but that's not the thing let's let's make the dreams come true you understand so bring the i say east versus west just to steal the pot i don't care east and west east and west it's not east versus west we are one big family and then if one says that you know he's the best let them prove this
Jerry Cadorette: all over the world instead of in the one section of the world so now it has been my dream i'm making my dreams come true by the support of the fans i mean didn't you enjoy you enjoyed it right it was so good normally it would be like i i wouldn't want to watch the meet i just want to go and get ready for my match but i had to go down just so i could watch the meet because there's so many good matches on there it was crazy you know because i would have rather hid in my room but
Engin Terzi: with those matchups you couldn't hide in your room you had to watch it yeah yeah yeah yeah you had to watch yeah i i hope he didn't he didn't uh reduce your performance but if you ever want to watch in your room uh just just tell me i i can give you a paper record yeah you can follow but nothing like the atmosphere did you realize the atmosphere after you won do you realize could you see the spectators there
Engin Terzi: the spectators that were in the stadium? In the venue after you won. Maybe you didn't see it when you win, but it was just like a big football game, you know, one made a goal, you know, they were like screaming, like they all jumped, especially the VIP section. The guys were like this, you know, just like crazy. They were just like, I was like, I regret that I didn't film that moment. Like maybe I didn't realize because you were also screaming. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I think...
Engin Terzi: I don't know. I mean, I'm biased, obviously, but I think my match was probably the best match of the day, right? Not best of the, I mean, match of the day. One of the, probably if I would count two or three best matches in all East versus West events, that was one of them. The other one was, if you remember, Zurab versus Rambet. Do you remember that match? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it was like 45 minutes, you know, just like with this restarts and yeah. Yeah, incredible match. I mean, if your match didn't,
Engin Terzi: happen that night wouldn't be that great i'm not saying that because you won't even if you cannot you won't the match was very good as as an organizer i really can't hold side you understand whoever wins wins you know yeah but that match was incredible but yeah thank you and uh i look forward to the next one being equally uh exciting and yeah with the same outcome
Jerry Cadorette: same outcome where i win i don't know if he's going to be able to get two matches but the uh it's it's going to be me victorious but i don't know how i don't know if he'll get one or not
Jerry Cadorette: You are saying that you don't know if it's going to be exciting or not. You're going to win, but it's up to Ermes to make it exciting. No, no, no. It's definitely going to be exciting. I said it's going to be a war, right? I don't expect either person is going to win with a flash pin. I think it's going to be a war. But here's the problem. When it comes down to a war, who has a history of being in wars, right? You do. You do. Yeah. So...
Jerry Cadorette: I think it comes down to a war and, you know, he may be quick, he may be fast. I'm not slow, but I think that it comes down to a war. I'm just saying is I don't know if he's going to be able to win a match. The three wins that I'm going to get, the three wins that I'm going to get are going to be on wars. It's just do I take do I take a loss or not? I don't know.
Engin Terzi: yeah just remember that hermes's biggest dream is to become number one in the world and that spot is occupied by levan so you are the person who is standing on his dream so he really wants to win so badly so badly so just
Jerry Cadorette: just trust me you don't see only a young guy with a good top roller or something he will put his everything to the table to win that much as well i want him to i i actually i'm a fan of his i'm telling him i'm a big fan of him right i i love his passion i love his energy i was first one to say it when other people said they didn't like him and they hated him and whatnot i went right on on
Jerry Cadorette: on record of saying that no i love the energy he brings i love his passion i love what he's doing for the sport um i truly do and uh you know i think once he has the match with me though he may want to drop down to 242. oh i understand i understand uh the white wolf says something let me ask this and then we can finish thank you for your super chat rifle uh
Engin Terzi: he says so jerry with you admittedly not having trained seriously in the past and now undertaking serious training i really believe we will see a completely different beast moving forward that's what he says absolutely i promise right and uh everyone should just
Jerry Cadorette: you'll see, watch, right? Because I'll post the videos. I'll show the transformation of where I am now to my progression to where I'm going to be. And remember, the goal is in shape for Levan. So I have to inevitably progressively get much, much better. Yeah, yeah. And then another one, what workouts will Jerry focus on from here until November? Mask Meyer is asking.
Engin Terzi: was the question uh which training you're gonna focus on i'm gonna focus on probably the same same things that you are focusing on all the time yeah my my big difference is going to be the amount of training i do
Jerry Cadorette: yeah we'll do similar exercises and the exercises i do are tailored to what i specifically do in arm wrestling i don't worry about looking like a beach muscle king or whatever i just want to be the strongest version of me that i can be so all the exercises i do are tailored to arm wrestling
Jerry Cadorette: And then what I plan on doing is elevating the numbers of weight, the amount of weight that I do, the amount of reps that I do, and then the amount of time I spend working out. And the level of competitors. I'm going to start traveling further to go find better training partners. And I'm still training with my group of guys that I have here in the States, in Massachusetts. I train in Bridgewater.
Engin Terzi: And they're a good group of guys, but I want to get some different people too. So I'm going to travel a little bit, see if I can pick up some other people to train with. Do you think that you and Michael just turn off the cameras and everything, just you and him, just like he is getting ready for Prudnik, you're getting ready for Ermes. Like, don't you think that, you know, we thought like really going a hundred percent just to not to injure each other or something.
Engin Terzi: i think that like just for training purpose i think like it would be good training you know because i mean even if you pull against two hands the guys pulling with two hands is different thing they don't have the technique they don't have the abilities how to while you're pulling against someone just has tons of knowledge experience you know so i think it would be good one yeah
Engin Terzi: yeah no i agree michael's been to my house he came to my house before when you know he was training getting ready and um you know i mean you john dave chaffee michael you know just time to time just even once a month just two trainings before these versus west five
Engin Terzi: no need cameras because when the camera is on when you just put on social media the ego is just getting involved you know no matter what what will people think what will people say this and this then you don't really get healthy training but the cameras off everyone just train you know i agree and i tried to get dave too to come train with i think it would have been better for him and better for me
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, it would be incredible. Yeah, because I mean, you guys are incredible. Like people are saying, oh, East is better than West. Like when you say East is better than West, you're talking about one country. And then here you're talking about 20 countries. When you compare one on one, America is one of the best for sure.
Engin Terzi: maybe not the very best but one of the best just compare america with latvia just compare america with this country maybe not the best but come on all the time we are sitting one country versus rest of the best you know in the world you know so it's i and and just one more super chat came so jerry train with devon stamina test big time white wolf says
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I would train with Devon. I think he's trying to drop weight and he's resting and healing. Yeah, I know, I know. Right now it's kind of too early for him to have just that level of training. And people say that before we close, say one more time, Engin. Engin! Engin! Thank you guys very, very much for watching us, following us. And I thank you very much, Jerry. And hope to see you in November. And just
Engin Terzi: I know you're going to do everything you plan to do, but the result we will see. But I know that you are going to come there with incredible shape. You are experienced enough. I have no doubt about your knowledge. Thank you. Take care, my friend. Take care. All right. By the way, by the way, you want to come any earlier? Did you have any kind of jet lag problem or how was it? I went there. There's perfect timing.
Jerry Cadorette: And I'll do the same thing for the next one. And is the next one gonna be at night again like you did?
Jerry Cadorette: Yeah, it will start 8 o'clock, but your match will be, again, one before John's match. Because, yeah. I went over there, and when I saw the schedule, and I saw it was going to start at 8, and I was matched, what, 15 out of 16? I knew it would be going until, like, 11 o'clock, and I don't think I competed until midnight. So, what I did was... Three matches less this time. Yeah, but either way, the thing is...
Jerry Cadorette: I changed my mind. Like I was switching to get on turkey time.
Jerry Cadorette: And then it changed my mindset the first day when I saw the time of the event. I thought the event was going to start at like 1, but it's 1 o'clock my time here, right? So I don't want to be on your time. I want to be on my time, right? So I stay up till like 3, 3.30 in the morning and I sleep until noon and then wake up at 12, 12.30 so that I'll be ready to compete at night.
Engin Terzi: so you want to be here you want to be here in wednesday wednesday okay or do you want to be tuesday uh no i think i it's it's a 10 hour flight so i gotta fly out tuesday night to get there for wednesday night so when is it morning yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah don't get don't leave me at the airport again you know what i thought it was it was 5 p.m you know because i have been busy with everything i wasn't 5 p.m i need to go i made every plan
Engin Terzi: and i just turned off on the phone and i was like hundreds of messages where are you where i was like what it was not 5 p.m it was 5 a.m yeah i'm very sorry about it because i have been busy with so many it's not an excuse i'm sorry it was a mistake but it will not happen again but i really thought on my mind it was next day 5 p.m i i forgot it was 5 a.m you know you but you check it
Engin Terzi: What? And you booked the tickets, so you knew the time. I know, I know. But do you know how many tickets I bought? 29 of them? I know. It's not an excuse. It's a mistake. It's my fault. I apologize. It will happen. But I'm just saying that I just kind of, on my mind, stay 5 p.m., not 5 a.m. Everything worked out. It don't matter. Yeah, yeah. Anyways, so anyways, you take care of yourself and hope to see you. I'll get in touch, my friend. Get strong.
Engin Terzi: You too. You too. Take care, my friend. All right. See you later.
