Engin Terzi: Hello, guys. Nice to see you all. It's my social media sponsored t-shirts. They are also the sponsor for the East versus West. Yeah, it shows here. Old school labs. I'll change this mirror thing.

Engin Terzi: Hello, The Woodsman. Good morning to you. Good afternoon to me. Hello, Victor. Hello, Night Film. As I said, waiting for, I think, he has, what, seven minutes. Hello.
Engin Terzi: Hello, my friend. A little update about my arms after stem cell. I kind of started to feel like breast pain, but still have pressure, especially with this two finger, especially with the ring finger.
Engin Terzi: Hello, Felix. Hello, my friend. But I feel joints good, you know, seriously. I feel good. I kind of feel that it will be good. Not sure about this lateral side, but inside of the joint capsule, I kind of feel tight. I don't know if it's because I rested so long time or is it because I really, I don't know.
Engin Terzi: feel good. Not bad. I'm not in good form. The joints feel better. But the doctor said that the full effect I will see in four months. So he also gave me a B12 mix with vitamin C, I think, injection. I think I used two or three of them already. And maybe that's also whether it's
Engin Terzi: feeling good. He said that he will help the nerves, you know, heal the nerve damages, but I don't know how much he will help. Alaykum Salaam. Alaykum Salaam. Alhamdulillah. How are you? Anyway, so also, Paolo will join us to translate.
Engin Terzi: Hello, my friend. Saludos. I hope you will heal soon, my friend. I have also back and neck issues. Let's see. Good morning to Texas. Six AM there. Michael workspace.
Engin Terzi: um last time devon told me he was close to come but i i don't want to go into more details but i kind of see like 50 50 but soon i think he needs to let me know so we can buy tickets if he's coming hello hello paul string
Engin Terzi: Hello, my friend. Hello, Engin Turbo. Somebody came this probably Petrenko because Paolo said he will be a few minutes late. Hello, Oleg. Hello. Hi. We don't know who is going to vote.

Engin Terzi: Can you guys remind me his last name? Because... No, John came separately. When John came, Oleg had to go to a wedding, so he couldn't come. So now today... So now this time we are hosting Oleg. I can't disturb John all the time.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but you write in a different language. How can I read that, Igor? Justin one second. Okay, his name is Paolo Derbedenyev. You know him? Paolo Derbedenyev. He lives in America. He is an armwrestler with a beard. He will come for translation in two minutes.
Engin Terzi: okay okay okay yeah how are you good form yes yes yeah put the phone somewhere you cannot hold one hour like this put on the somewhere what because you hold all time like this okay you need to put in a table or something yeah
Engin Terzi: I think in a few minutes, Pablo will come for translation. Oleg, can you not put the phone somewhere on the table, maybe? Because it is all time moving.
Engin Terzi: until pablo comes you know i need to try to explain to him you know maybe someone who knows ukraine ukrainian on the chat
Engin Terzi: can write me with latin alphabet what what i can i should tell him after he said you guys translate me until pablo comes i'm here oh oh paulo came here oh can you tell him to like if it is possible to put the phone somewhere on the uh table or something instead of holding yes one hour you know he will be all time moving
Pavlo (Translator): Oleg, hello. My name is Pavlo. Hello, hello. He's asking you to put your phone somewhere so that you don't hold it in your hands for an hour. He says that you have to hold it somewhere. Yes, yes. Like this. Okay? Is it good like this?
Pavlo (Translator): is it okay like this i mean yeah i mean as long as it is stable you know it's not moving all the time like this how are you paulo okay good morning okay yeah i'm good morning coffee yeah looks like you wake up very early
Engin Terzi: uh yeah i do i do i have some morning routines usually you know um can you can you ask him you know is she ready for john
Engin Terzi: ready and i i know he's a respectful guy but there is uh nothing disrespectful you know if you could uh just say about his chances against john
Pavlo (Translator): Is he frozen? Yeah, looks like he's frozen, yeah. Okay.
Pavlo (Translator): maybe a call came to him or something and how have you been paulo now i see two paulo one is frozen one is
Pavlo (Translator): That's better. Two more windows. We can see you. That's it. Very good. Great. Did you hear me? No, I didn't. He asks, what are your chances with John? What do you think? I think we have equal chances. It depends on how we prepare. How John prepares and how I do.
Pavlo (Translator): I think I'm in very good shape. I will come to this fight. Well, there will still be a lot to depend on John.
Pavlo (Translator): uh saying that uh chances are pretty much equal uh like 50 50 and it's very much depends on uh how ready uh both athletes will be and he's saying that he is in a very great shape and uh he will be in his uh peak at the moment of the you know superman so he's saying that just
Pavlo (Translator): clarify you know he's in his best ever shape in his life uh oleg is
Pavlo (Translator): 30% stronger than he was back then. Cool. Okay, yeah, he's saying that super form, best in his life. And he never even been close to that what he is right now. He was in a pretty good shape in 2019 at Zloty Tour. And he's thinking that he's plus 30% now. Plus what? Plus 30% to Zloty now.
Engin Terzi: plus 30 percent that's what he said exactly wow wow and that year he won comfortably wow wow wow yeah and he even beat dadikyan with left arm that day and he beat dadikyan comfortably and now he says he is 30 percent
Pavlo (Translator): stronger and he is gonna pull left arm with Zurab and how does he see his chances with Zurab? How do you see your chances with Zurab? With Zurab, I think I have more chances to win because I have already fought with Zurab and I understand how to fight with him. Of course, he doesn't understand how to fight with me, but I think I will win with Zurab.
Pavlo (Translator): uh he's saying that uh with zurab the chances are probably better than with john because he understands uh properly how to pull zurab and he pulls her up before so he thinks he's gonna win i i heard that like he is with one one with rub or what's his score with zurab
Pavlo (Translator): I lost to him in the European Championship and won the World Championship in a few months. I understand. So, him being 30% stronger than his rotator shape today, if he is making the right calculation,
Engin Terzi: paulo it is i saw him i saw him in 2019 i've been there oh you were there yeah i remember yeah wow anyway so yesterday he shared something on social media and he shared and he said we are the new generation of our masters and east versus west is the proof of this
Pavlo (Translator): like evidence of this did he mean to say that they are in like advanced level then like what our masters were before or till today is
Pavlo (Translator): Do you think that modern armwrestling and armwrestlers are better than the armwrestlers that were long ago? I can't say that they are better, but I think that a new generation is coming. Armwrestling is Prudnik, Gasparini, me, Daikyan.
Pavlo (Translator): which will dominate in the coming years, I think so. I don't want to write down the older generation, John, Michael Todd, Devon, Larratt, but I think that now, in this period, there will be changes. East-West will be supported by this. Of course. He's saying that
Pavlo (Translator): basically yes it's a new generation like him prudnik ermis
Pavlo (Translator): that he can, and he said, I don't want to, you know, put to the junkyard or sign out the old generation like Michael Todd and Loret and John Brzenk, but he thinks that those new generation will dominate for the future years, and it's their time, and East versus West will be the proof of it. Okay, so he is basically saying that those guys' time is over, no disrespect.
Engin Terzi: respect them but their time is over and now it is the new era yes this is what he is saying so then if he's saying that east versus west is the evidence of this then he should have seen his chances more than 50 50 with john because it is like when so either he is because of the respect he is saying 50 50 or there is a some contradiction you know with what he said in
Pavlo (Translator): his own prediction about his own match. Engin says that if you say so, then you had a chance with John to evaluate a little better than 50-50, because either you respect John too much, or you're a little against yourself, you know. Yes, of course, I respect John.
Pavlo (Translator): I don't say before the fight that I will be able to win. Of course, I believe in my victory, I have faith in it, I am confident in it. But the help to John and another factor is that I have never even stood at the table with John. So I don't know yet what to expect from him. But I have such a thought that
Pavlo (Translator): he's saying absolutely yes it's a lot of respect to the to john and uh he uh believes and he trusts that he will win but uh there is some factor that he never pulled john before not even in the practice so he doesn't really know what to expect
Pavlo (Translator): uh and uh yeah it's a lot of respect that's why he said i didn't want to say that you know i'm dominating and blah blah blah because i never pulled the guy so uh but he he believes he in in his win and he said that yes from now on it's going to change that young generation will take the place okay so it sounds like you know from now on
Engin Terzi: the possibly to it to change it is 50%. That wouldn't sound enough. In fact, you know, I repeat myself, but you know, it's gonna change it for sure. But what's your chance is 50%. So, so we will see that 50% there is a possibility that it will change. Anyway, so, and he told me that his weight is over 100 kilo. Can you again ask him what's his weight?
Pavlo (Translator): An average 104 kilos. It's shifting between 103 and 105. Yeah. And, and, and,
Engin Terzi: when he said okay some people on the chat that what was his weight at the Zlotitur and Zlotitur he was 95 kilo now he's 104 kilos so he's nine kilo heavier and when he said about the his power about 30 percent is it like people on the chat they are asking is it like general like arm power or did it also affect his hand wrist strength as well that 30 percent because that is the place that
Engin Terzi: will play an important role against John. Not sure if John is going to go inside.
Pavlo (Translator): He's back to the topic that you said that you were somewhere around 30% to the gold tour in 2019. Someone in the chat is asking if this is your general power, whether it is transformed into steel, into your hand, into something specific.
Pavlo (Translator): he's saying that uh
Pavlo (Translator): yeah it's overall power and it's transforming to everything the 30 plus everything base uh exercises like uh bench press and everything else and specific exercises for the wrist fingers and everything else approximately 30 plus um does his match against raymond's antonovich put any doubts
Pavlo (Translator): him you know in his mind about his match with uh john because he had his hand some troubled was troubled in that match and she feel more confidence uh since that time um
Pavlo (Translator): No, I'm not happy with this match. The result is satisfactory, but the fight itself was very bad. I had a little trauma, so the bone just disconnected me from the second round. Something crunched in the elbow.
Pavlo (Translator): Yeah, okay, so comments was like that. He is not satisfied with his armwrestling at that match. The result was okay, but the actual armwrestling was very poor.
Pavlo (Translator): the explanations are that there was some you know underwater stones there was a covet there was a uh some minor injuries and when they just start to pull uh some uh you know some cranking was in the wrist and in elbows so he said whatever now everything is history and this preparation is completely different animal mm-hmm
Pavlo (Translator): And the comment was that when he was pulling Ryan's, that his form was not even close to the form he was at Zloty Tur. Oh, so he's saying that his form against Antonovich was not even as good as the Zloty Tur.
Engin Terzi: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. And can you ask him how, like, has he been training with any other Ukrainian arm masters such as Paseka or Margarine? These guys, like,
Pavlo (Translator): Did he recently train with these guys during the preparation for John? I'm asking if you've been sparring with John lately. If so, how do you feel? No, I haven't been sparring with them lately. We live very far from each other.
Pavlo (Translator): Now we have a war in Ukraine, so it's not easy to travel around Ukraine. And with Persik, it so happened that for the last three months we haven't sparred. But we are very good friends with him and often sparred faster with him. I had the feeling that Persik was very strong. Lately, I've been fighting him.
Pavlo (Translator): okay uh engine so the answer is uh not within the last three months margarita margarita is too far
Pavlo (Translator): and travel in ukraine is uh very limited during to work uh they they've been pulling last time like three months ago uh and paseka is very strong said uh oleg but uh oleg was winning lately did the last time when it was in better shape yeah but since that time three months now he's in serious preparation for john yeah and yeah they can understand reasons i understand um like
Engin Terzi: if he beats john and is there any goal in his mind or he's just focused on john mesh for now or does he have like further plans yeah
Pavlo (Translator): Oleg asks, if you beat John, do you have any further goals, tasks, plans, or are you just focusing on this match? Yes, of course, I would like to fight in the next Istvest 6. It turns out that the next opponent is maybe Onar Gabayev. Do you hear me? Yes, we hear you, you are a little stuck, but we hear you.
Pavlo (Translator): Oh, now we can't hear you. No, he froze for now, but he started saying that, yeah, absolutely. Oh, Oleg, you froze. No, no, one more question. We didn't hear you after Angrabayev. You said that you want to fight, maybe you will fight for Angrabayev, and then you froze. Yes, I would like to, after John, if I win,
Pavlo (Translator): He's saying that if I'm going to win John,
Pavlo (Translator): the next hopefully maybe on Garbaev and East versus West six? No, the East versus six already on Garbaev is set with lrakli. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. But maybe after this. Yeah. And he's saying that if he want to win on Garbaev,
Engin Terzi: then maybe Devon Laird. Okay, that's another question I want to ask him. We have category 95, 105, 115. In which categories of these three, I know that he is now in 105 kilo category, but is there any possibility to win the title?
Engin Terzi: like to pull 115 95 i think whenever he said he wants to maybe pull devon he's probably talking about 115 or devon needs to go down to 105 and can you ask him you know is he also interested to pull in uh more than 100 different than 105 kilos
Pavlo (Translator): I understand that you weigh 105 kg, but is there any interest in fighting in other categories? Maybe you want to lose 95 kg or gain 115 kg? For me, 105 kg is a new category, so I'm trying my best. If I succeed, I'm not against it.
Pavlo (Translator): To be honest, I don't really want to lose weight, but if 105 kg was too hard for me, then it's possible that I will return to the 95 kg category. Because the 95 kg category was comfortable for me.
Pavlo (Translator): He's saying that 105 kilos is a new class for him. He usually used to pull in 95. And he doesn't have anything against the gains, you know, to gain weight. But he wants to try the 105 kg. And he said, I don't really want to lose weight. But if I will not feel comfortable in 105, I'm willing to lose and, you know, get back to a comfortable. Yeah, but he has nothing against gaining weight.
Engin Terzi: So for 115 kilo, if there is an opponent, he would pull. Yes. But he said he will try a new class at 105 and feel how it's for him. In fact, we had 115 kilo category match between Prudnik and Dadikyan. But Dadikyan unfortunately got injured in Dubai when he was pulling Morozov.
Engin Terzi: Dadikyan has the title of 105 kilo. It was 100, but now we change it to 105 kilo title Dadikyan has. If there is any possibility to pull Dadikyan at 105 kilo, would he be interested?
Pavlo (Translator): Okay, he says that now Daddycan has a title, a place on East vs West, on the right hand in the 105th category. Unfortunately, he is now injured when he fought with Morozov. But he asks if you would be interested in the 105th and fight with Daddycan if he recovers and lives in his hand. Yes, yes, I think it was an interesting fight.
Pavlo (Translator): Yes, I think so. We already fought with him. I won, but it wasn't easy for me. It was a tough fight, but on the left hand. I didn't fight with him on the right.
Pavlo (Translator): yeah he's saying that uh it was a very very interesting match the last time he pulled he said it was left arm it was not right arm but still he said I won but it was not an easy win and uh it will be a very interesting match the the I saw the final match final match wasn't hard was the qualification match hard because the final match I saw I don't think it was hard
Pavlo (Translator): He says that he saw the final match with Zadikian and said that it didn't look like it was hard for him. Was it a qualifier match that was harder? It was the previous match, not the final one. Zadikian didn't get the prize on the left, he was fourth or fifth.
Pavlo (Translator): He's saying that probably he was already pumped a little bit because they've been pulling in the previous matches. So probably he was pumped already to the finals. But he said that in qualification match he was hard match. Oh, okay. That is why I was surprised that he was that dominant because Radigan is also very strong. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I understand. Another question. Does Sandris Pushkar have a part in his motivation?
Pavlo (Translator): I did not understand. Does the memory of Sandris Pushkar have some role in his motivation? Yes, of course. Sandris was more than just a coach.
Pavlo (Translator): He was a person who supported and helped. And now, at every tournament, it motivates me to fight and win. And he is a person who I can't compare to today. But we know that Sandris was a champion, so I also want to achieve at least a part of what Sandris achieved.
Pavlo (Translator): Okay. Yeah, absolutely. Sandris was more than a trainer. It was the human who was helping in all aspects of the life. And absolutely memory is alive. Every tournament is, you know, motivated by him. And he said that Sandris set that plank of champion that high that he's trying to reach that plank.
Engin Terzi: And that's the very good motivation. It'd be at least partially like him. Yeah, that's good to hear. And let's ask him, you know, some predictions about the other matches. First of all, how does he see East versus West? And this is going to be his first time. Is he excited to be here?
Pavlo (Translator): He says, let's move on to the predictions of who will fight. And the first question, he asks, are you waiting for you to come to East vs West? How do you assess East vs West as a tournament? Yes, of course I'm waiting. I've been waiting since the winter, but for a reason.
Pavlo (Translator): We have a war in Ukraine, I could not come faster. For me, this is the number one tournament in the world now. Therefore, I think every athlete has a dream to get to this tournament.
Pavlo (Translator): okay yeah absolutely he's waiting for it he's very excited he's been waiting since uh the previous winter but because of the war in Ukraine uh make some changes uh so he couldn't make it earlier but yes absolutely he's waiting very much and he thinks that East versus West uh uh as of right now is a number one uh tournament in the world and he said that it's a probably a dream of every athlete to be part of it yeah
Engin Terzi: Can you tell him that we are very honoured to have him also? We are very honoured. He is such a great puller and also a very respectful guy towards his opponents and everything. We will be very happy to see him here.
Pavlo (Translator): Thank you, Engin, and he's very happy that he has an opportunity to be there.
Engin Terzi: this is only because he deserves no one gives him a favor and so if we go to do some matches predictions before we finish um so is there any specific match that other than his own match excites him the most
Pavlo (Translator): uh yeah he said michael todd was putting but he probably doesn't know that todd is injured
Pavlo (Translator): Oh, he doesn't know about this? Let me ask him. Hold on. Oh, I'm sorry.
Pavlo (Translator): uh very very cool match and he's very uh happy that he will be able to see it live yeah and what's his prediction um
Pavlo (Translator): He's saying that it's a little bit hard to predict, you know, because it's going to be a strong, strong match. But he thinks that Gasparini is going to be a winner. Gasparini is going to win these things. I understand. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: What do you think, Engin? I'm the organizer. Do you think it would be nice if I say this guy is going to win? No, it's not going to be nice, but it will be very provocative, you know.
Engin Terzi: no no people are already you know there are my my haters they are already there and they are like you know oh let him say something wrong so we can just attack him all over even if it is not the truth you know just let's attack him you know anyway so it's very good to be in my place because i can say absolutely anything and nobody yeah yeah you're right you're right yeah and
Pavlo (Translator): And the match was canceled between Jerry and Ermes. What was he thinking about that match, if it wasn't canceled? He thinks that Gasparini, too,
Pavlo (Translator): And he even thinks that the Dave Chaffee match and Gasparini is a harder match than Gasparini. Okay, ask him something. Tell him to answer very honestly. I'm sure he will be. But what was he thinking before Gennady and Jerry match?
Pavlo (Translator): Tell me honestly, what did you think before the match between Jerry Caderet and Gennady Kikvinya? What did you think? That Kikvinya would win 3-0. It was supposed to be like that, as if Kikvinya started to fight for me.
Engin Terzi: yeah he thought that cooking you're gonna win three zero before quickenia start to pull some weird things on the table and it was supposed to be his win but it maybe maybe he had to pull that way unless you feel jerry's power yeah because because day before the match john told me that jerry is gonna win and i said like are you joking or serious he said yeah
Engin Terzi: Especially if Gennady goes outside and then just watch. This is what he told me. And I was also underestimating Jerry. But the guy is better than what we are thinking, maybe. He says, yes. He says, the day before the fight with Gian, Gian said to Engin, yes, Jerry will win.
Pavlo (Translator): Engin didn't believe it. He said, you must be kidding. No way. He said, yes, yes, you'll see. He said, especially if Gena goes outside, Jerry will win. And Engin said that he underestimated Jerry. He also didn't believe that this could happen. Maybe. Maybe. It looks like that from the outside. Maybe, in fact, it's different.
Engin Terzi: There is legendary pull of Sharon Ramaz in the chat. Hello, Sharon. And hello, Magda. See you soon. And see you in January, Sharon. You will have a match with Zaur. Legend category. Anyway, so...
Engin Terzi: So he's saying that Dave Chaffee versus Ermes will be a tough match, but Ermes is going to win. And what was he thinking about Michael versus Prudnik? We know that Prudnik is from Ukraine, probably he would favor Prudnik, but let's still ask, you know, what was he expecting from that match? If it wasn't there.
Pavlo (Translator): Well, Prudnik and Monster were replaced, but what do you think, what would it be like for you? He says, I understand that Prudnik is a Ukrainian, of course, you support him, but maybe some comments, how would that match have been, what are your thoughts on this match?
Pavlo (Translator): It would be very difficult for Prudnik, but Prudnik is strong and he would have a chance to fight, but he would need to approach this fight very technically and competently. Because he is a very difficult and strong opponent. Prudnik would have a chance to win if he did everything right, I think so. I support Prudnik.
Pavlo (Translator): yeah he's saying yeah for sure he's pulling for putnik because prudnik is from ukraine but he think that that that's a great match and uh prudnik has a good chance to win but uh monster is uh very you know very difficult difficult opponent and prudnik did would have to be very technical and will did not make any mistakes during the match to you know to prove that he can win
Engin Terzi: and there is a possibility in my opinion 50 possibility that they will not may replace michael still i didn't get the answer for sure that yes or no from devon if something like that happens then what's his prediction okay
Pavlo (Translator): He says that there is a 50% chance that Devuan Larratt will replace Michael. He has not received an answer yet, it is not known to the end, but it is possible that this will happen. What do you think, how will the fight go if Devuan will fight with Prudnik? Is it going to be 5 vs 5? Yes. He is waiting for the result.
Pavlo (Translator): He thinks that if Larratt even will take the match, he will not have enough time to be in a good shape to prepare the good form and that will give possibility to Prudnik to win. What if Devon is already in good shape?
Pavlo (Translator): And I'm sorry, I will translate in a second. I have a little conversation to Oleg.
Pavlo (Translator): Look at Gian, for example, he fights every four weeks, every month and a half and keeps the same form. Maybe. I just think that Larratt is not in the best shape right now. Because when he gets ready, he gets ready for a long time, as far as I know. Okay, I'll translate. Maybe his current form is enough for Krutnik, but you have to see it.
Pavlo (Translator): okay yeah he thinks uh still that uh uh the athlete cannot uh hold their peak form for always or for a long time and uh I already asked him a question about John and I said listen John been pulling for two years now after his comeback and he is just you know
Pavlo (Translator): gaining the form he doesn't do any preparations but he said uh no probably not because for serious super matches larat taking a very long time like half a year to get ready so he doesn't think that uh he's in a big form right now but he said maybe his form is enough for pudnik but he don't think so yeah the the just to clarify that is lagia says devon called me
Engin Terzi: After Michael canceled the match because of his injury, Devon called me. When Devon called me, right away, I made a joke. I said, Devon, I just announced your match with Prudnik. And he's like, good. And I said, soon, Prudnik is going to make a video and call you coward or chicken or something if you don't accept the match. That's what I told him.
Engin Terzi: I was just joking and he's like, good. And I was like, what are you talking about? Good. You, we are joking, right? He's like, no, I'm not joking. I'm ready to come. I was like, are you serious? Like I would never even offer you such a match, like with like 25 days, 27 days, whatever. And he said, no, hanging. I'm serious. I'm coming. You know? I mean, there is a problem like personal things you understand, but if I fix that,
Engin Terzi: will come this is what he told me i didn't even offer him a match so if people are thinking that i offer him a match 25 days 27 days notice they are mistaken they haven't won at the pool so just to clarify you know you want me to translate it for um it's not maybe okay you can because he thinks that he is not ready then then maybe he would
Pavlo (Translator): Well, he says, listen, we were talking on the couch and started joking that I told everyone that you were going to fight Prudnik. And where did he say that without joking, like, I'll come.
Pavlo (Translator): He says, I have some personal problems there, and I have to deal with all that. But he says, maybe I'll come. Engin was even a little shocked. He says, I'm not pushing you into a match in four weeks, or not a full four weeks before that. He says, I understand that you have to prepare. He says, no, no, everything is fine. If it comes out here, I'll come.
Pavlo (Translator): he said yeah if he said so i'm a little concerned now maybe he is in a good shape because he would not want did he hear anything about the training in belgium what did
Pavlo (Translator): Petrenko here anything about Devon and Prudnik training in Belgium about about a Montego or Michigan?
Pavlo (Translator): There was also Kalinichenko, Ilnitsky, an athlete. There are still a few athletes, I just don't know them. Yeah, he's saying that he heard about it and he knows that they've been, you know, training and he knows that Kalinichenko and Ilnitsky was present there too, but he doesn't know what the results was, how it ends up and who is who. I mean, the result was
Engin Terzi: enough to think that it will be a good match. So you can tell only this much. I saw all the training, but you can tell him that the result of that training makes me think that it is going to be a very good match that could go either way.
Pavlo (Translator): Hengin says that he saw the whole sparring and after the results he thinks that it will be a very, very close and cool match if it happens. That's great. I think we need such armwrestling matches in the world that are equal in strength. Interesting.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he thinks that arm wrestling world need matches like those very much. They are pretty equal and they are interesting. Yeah, let's see. Let's see if it's going to happen or not. But regardless, East vs. West 5 will be the best event, super match event in the history, in my opinion. With those 15 matches, now 14, but we will see if it's going to be 15 again or not. And what does he think about Artem Morozov vs. Ermes with left arm?
Pavlo (Translator): What do you think, Artyom and Ermes, left? Left? I can't say for sure, because I don't know how Gasparini did with his left hand. I haven't seen it for a long time. I haven't seen him fight with his left hand. I don't know the information. He cannot predict it, because he didn't see that Gasparini pulled left for a long time, and he doesn't know. Morozov...
Pavlo (Translator): He surprised me the most. Of all the sportsmen who fought on East-West, he progressed. Honestly, I didn't think he was so strong. Deiva fought, then a draw with Dadikyan. Well, maybe it's because of Dadikyan's injury, but still, it's serious.
Pavlo (Translator): another uh artyom uh surprising him very much how he progressing in east versus west and he's like i did not expect that that he won dave chafee basically uh uh it's uh you know equal with the decan and uh he he's progressing very very impressive i understand
Engin Terzi: So he doesn't have any opinion about it because he doesn't know Ermes' shape with left arm. Yes, that's what he said. And if we go another important match, Revaz Lutidze versus Artem Morozov.
Pavlo (Translator): Yeah, he's saying that if somebody would ask me half a year ago,
Pavlo (Translator): he would go for Rivas but now he is saying yes Morozov because uh by the style he pulling and by the ability of finding those uh you know fine uh edges and keys during the match and make those small technique adjustments you're saying yeah I've come Morozov and one of the fans are asking like how is right and left compared to each other uh Alex
Pavlo (Translator): Yeah, he's saying it's almost the same left and right. They're a little different.
Engin Terzi: uh that the right hand may be a little bit better and it's a better much better hook in the wrist and the left arm is much better in uh top his hook is also good because whenever i remember him playing with dadik and he was in yeah he was left yeah yeah i saw him with daddy and he was like he dragged you know like
Pavlo (Translator): He said that Dadikyan is very fast and he basically dictate that hook on the left arm and basically have to pull in the hook. Yeah, have to, but he was still successful in hook, is what I chose to hear.
Pavlo (Translator): And he says, yes, you did well in the left hooks too. I train everything. I try to fight in different directions. But there are strong sides, and there are, I think, a little weaker. But I can fight in the weaker ones. Thinking as an athlete, I think that everyone wants to fight with their strong side, impose their own style of fighting.
Pavlo (Translator): yeah he's saying that uh you know all the thinking thinking athletes trying to uh pull in their stronger sides but he said you know if my let's say left uh hook is weaker doesn't mean that it's weak it's just weaker than his right yeah yeah so he said that you called all of the arm wrestling aspects on both arms i i know he wouldn't want to say this but um
Pavlo (Translator): Does he think his chances are higher against John in a top row battle or a hook battle? He says, well, he probably doesn't want to share with us, but I'll ask. What do you think, with John, where do you stand? From above or in the hooks? From above, of course, from above.
Pavlo (Translator): he thinks he said that uh top role is better chance but uh the most important is a hand control who will take the hand control
Pavlo (Translator): yeah he said that he's watching a lot of videos with John uh to see uh and to learn how people winning in what positions and how people losing and I already make a joke that uh I know how to lose to John that's easy and he's he's getting crazy in all aspects you know the he's training everything
Engin Terzi: that so he's saying that if john and him goes both outside alexis his chance is higher than if they go both inside you think so yes he thinks so i i would disagree but he thinks i i also disagree i also disagree yeah yeah but after i saw john catching corey west in hook and somehow winning i cannot underestimate his hook either but um
Engin Terzi: 104 kilo Oleg inside? Hmm. Yeah, I'm my guess my guess Oleg maybe generally stronger. But the only thing is that how much can he translate to the table is saying, when you are pulling against John, you know, he's more like armresting machine with the coordination and everything. And whenever I see like on the web, Paul, he can do is very technical. And
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but can everyone do the same thing, you know, because it is not only about raw power. It is, I don't know. I personally see his chance. If they go inside, I see Petrenko's chance higher. If they both go outside or if Petrenko goes inside, John goes outside, then I see John's chance a little bit higher. So how do you see?
Pavlo (Translator): i i would agree completely with you because uh overall power and john everybody is stronger than john i mean seriously when you talk about the chest biceps yeah overall overall strengths everybody is stronger than not everybody but those elitists generally strong top athletes yeah probably everybody's stronger than john but
Pavlo (Translator): uh that everybody can win from john you know and uh yeah i agree with you that uh inside and the deeper that inside the better uh chances uh for all like i agree with you but let me try to translate and tell him what we what he thinks say your opinion to translate your own opinion as well
Pavlo (Translator): Okay, okay, well, Oleg, we talked a little bit with him. We think, and he and I think about the same thing, that you still have better and greater chances in hooks with Jan. You still have, in general, you are stronger than Jan, but we also said that, well, top athletes are all stronger in general than Jan, because he just has all these...
Pavlo (Translator): Yes. That's the point. And we think that if you both go up, then Jan has a better chance. If you go in the middle, and Jan goes up, then you're about the same. And if you're in the hooks, then you have a better chance. That's what we understand. I understand that. I'm a little dissatisfied, but anything is possible.
Pavlo (Translator): I think that when I fight, I will look for my strong side and where I can fight him. I understand that this fight will be very difficult technically. Maybe not as physically as it will be technically difficult with John. Because this is a legend of armwrestling, a professor.
Pavlo (Translator): um yeah he's saying that uh the respect to the athlete is huge he's a professor he's a you know goat of our sport and he said anyway I want to win and he will try to
Pavlo (Translator): he will be looking for the ways on the table too and he will try and i made a joke yeah yeah that you will try for sure i've been trying to but yeah it's where he he's very respectful to john yeah yeah try to find he will try to find the way where he can yeah yeah yeah yeah and and people from the chat uh i don't want them to misunderstand when paulo said that everyone is stronger than john
Engin Terzi: he doesn't mean at the arm wrestling table he's talking about general like gym numbers you know like lifting this bench press that and this and that because the guy is not made of gym but whatever he has he hundred percent translates the table he's just like a arm wrestling machine you know so this is what we mean not not that john is weak or something john is incredibly strong
Engin Terzi: pure arm wrestling power he has while his opponents may be better in the gym but when it comes to table to coordinating those muscle groups and translating 100 to the table is not often possible for his openness am i wrong with my explanation absolutely right absolutely yeah yeah because some people make you know paulo said everyone is stronger than john
Pavlo (Translator): they may misunderstand that's why i've made the explanation john's training is uh uh let's put it it's different than anybody else uh let's say john and devon they are training a little bit similar if i can say that because they not they those guys are not growing overall power they don't heavy lifting
Pavlo (Translator): they they don't i mean they do lift but they do some specific you know short small lifting they dead holes rubber bands the handles but they don't believe they don't bench i will look look at oleg's uh shoulders is it me or really that's the story right that's sure in the camera
Engin Terzi: He put the camera down. I mean, yeah, his chest, shoulders and everything, you know, he just like looks, I mean, he's like, like, you know, those, those American football players, you know, they are putting something on their, you know, shoulders, you know, he looks really big.
Engin Terzi: You look like an American football player in those gloves. Oleg, show us biceps. Show us biceps. Show off. But he's just pulling so much back. Justin bring me near the camera. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is his measurements on biceps and forearm? How many centimeters do you have in your biceps and forearm?
Pavlo (Translator): in this position uh forearm 45 and biceps is about 47. is it cold numbers uh so here like this 45 for um
Engin Terzi: It's a big number, big number. Really big number. The biggest I have seen my forearm was 43, but it was warm after table time. 45 bicep forearm is really big, yeah. Anyways, he has been in Turkey, right, before? He has been in Antalya, 2018. Is it one time he has been here?
Pavlo (Translator): What was it, the world WAF? He has been in Turkey only once, in Antalya WAF Worlds in 2018. He won the Budapest.
Engin Terzi: uh and uh in budapest in 2017 he won yeah in in budapest i think he was fourth place no third place he said he won he said he beat hajumrat but hajumrat took fourth and the third third was him
Engin Terzi: And the second was the Georgii guy. And the first was Kocak. And Hajumrat, first match, he lost against Georgii. And then he went to the B side. And the B side, semi-final, him and Hajumrat, long match, long match, you know. And then he won. I think he won. And then Hajumrat took fourth place there. And then he went to Antalya. And in Antalya, first was Zolaev. Zolaev beat him twice.
Pavlo (Translator): And then he beat Kocak twice. And he took second place there. Mask me if I remember correctly or not. He says that in Budapest he doesn't remember that you won the first place. In Budapest I won the first place in juniors. And in Antalya, in Turkey, I won the second place. The first place was Khachamrat Zolayev, the second place was me.
Pavlo (Translator): Kazakhstan, Kochak was the fourth, Tautiv the fifth, Plament the sixth, Dimitrov, Zurab the seventh, Tavberitsi. Tell me, in Antalya, was it among men or also juniors? Yes, among men. I was the first.
Pavlo (Translator): Budapest, he was pulling the junior men still, and he won the junior men division. And in Antalya, he took second place in senior men. Yeah, yeah, in Oleg. But Budapest, he was third, right, in the senior? He didn't pull seniors, he pulled only juniors.
Pavlo (Translator): Okay, what did he have with them? Where did he beat Zolev in Budapest? Are you not the one who translated he beat Zolev in Budapest? Different junior from Ukraine was pulling Zolev. Okay, that was different. But didn't you just say that he beat
Engin Terzi: zolev no you you didn't translate that way like 20 seconds ago like one minute ago before i asked no what did you say about the budapest then before uh in budapest he took first place in junior man no this is what you are saying now before before before i asked him again you were saying something you know i can i can find here if you want yeah i'll try i don't know maybe i translate something wrong but i don't think so
Oleg Petrenko: In Budapest, he won the Budapest. Okay, you say that he won the Budapest, yeah. He won the Budapest. He won the Budapest. He won the Budapest. He won the Budapest.
Engin Terzi: Okay, I misunderstood you. I misunderstood you. You say that he won in Budapest. But when you say Budapest, you mean juniors, youth category. I thought that he beat Zolaev in Budapest because I remember there was a Ukrainian guy and Zolaev had a very long match. He remembers that one? Yes, yes. That's what he said. What's the name of the guy that beat Zolaev there?
Engin Terzi: What's the name of the guy who fought Zoloev in Budapest? Artem Sereda. Artem Sereda, okay. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Because I thought that when you said Budapest, it was him, you know. Because I don't remember, five years ago, yeah. Yeah, that was like Zoloev was attacking, attacking, attacking, he stopped, stopped, stopped, and then Zoloev just gave up suddenly, you know, it was, yeah. Yeah, Sereda, okay. Yeah, that's good, that's good, that's interesting, yeah.
Pavlo (Translator): So that is the only time he came to Turkey? This will be second time? Yeah, for tournament, yes, it's second time, but he was going for vacation there. He has been here for vacation before. Okay. Okay. That's interesting. Yeah. Alani.
Engin Terzi: Alanya, okay, Alanya. It's the town of Antalya. Yeah. So is there anything you want to add, Paolo? No, I can't wait. I want to see this. You want to see this match? And what's your personal opinion between John Brzenk and Petrenko? Personal opinion.
Pavlo (Translator): um i think petrenko i think he's gonna beat him it is it is because of ukraine thing or just no objective no no uh because petrenko's fingers is strong enough to uh hold jams outside the role yeah do you think the finger alone is enough or you need
Pavlo (Translator): uh i mean it's it's everything but it's mostly uh wrist and fingers if uh if uh if somebody is able to hold john's role
Pavlo (Translator): uh and still have his cup i think petrenko's hook will dominate john's hook not dominate but it's stronger because i i pulled john and i know what i'm talking about approximately i never pulled all it but uh i saw how he pulls and zloty and i i i believe that there is a uh it's not a big difference but it's maybe 60 40.
Engin Terzi: Oh, 60-40 is big. For me, small difference is like 50-48 or something. No, but yeah, if Oleg will make a mistake, this will be over for him. Yeah, Magda, I mean, I can, of course, comment, you know. And I think you guys misunderstood that. He says the WAF officials cannot go there. I talked with WAF. They said that the athletes can compete in King of the Table qualification. There is nothing like that.
Engin Terzi: It's about the referees, referees, official referees. Anyway, so. So I just I just wish him the best. And I also wish John best and hope that. You know everything will be fine. There will be no injury and. I'm sure the one who deserves you know will win and just can't wait to see him. He will be here in.
Engin Terzi: uh what's today thursday thursday thursday so he will be here less than three weeks in 20 days he will be here and hope to see him and please thank him for uh being my guest on youtube and also accepting to compete at the east versus west please and i also thank you very much paulo for the translation and for joining
Engin Terzi: it's you are not a translator you know you are not only translated we are now talking with a translator who has full with john bersing and knows more than the guy who is gonna pull john bersing about john bersing you know probably yes okay uh
Pavlo (Translator): Very nice.
Pavlo (Translator): Also, thank you, Engin, for inviting me. We had a good conversation. Also, thank you, Pavlo, for your help. See you in Istanbul. He said, thank you, Engin, for invitation. And we'll see you in Istanbul. He also thanks me for translation. And yeah, that's what it is. And thank you, guys. Thank you, everyone who watched us. And tomorrow, tomorrow,
Engin Terzi: I'm going to have a very important person as a guest. Lewan Saginashvili, he will share his opinions about the East versus West five. And if you have time, join us and let's see what he thinks. And before we close, Paolo, can you ask him who is the person that he thinks that has a chance against this Georgii
Pavlo (Translator): Giant, monster, Hulk, we should say. Can you ask him, please, what he thinks, who is the person who has the most chance? Before we close, he asks you, what do you think, who has the most chances for Georgii Hulk and Levan? At the moment, honestly, I don't see who can fight him.
Engin Terzi: At this moment, honestly, nobody. Yeah, I also think something similar. I know it is very, very emotional name for him. And I don't expect him to be so objective about it. Maybe he's also objective. But does he think that if Pushkar leave, he would have chance?
Pavlo (Translator): I understand that this is a sensitive topic for you. He asks if Pushkar Sandris was alive, do you think he would have any chances to prepare for Lebanon? I think so.
Pavlo (Translator): I think, of course, there would be a chance, because Sandris had a strong side, speed, explosive power. I think, considering her, he would have a chance against Livan. Yes, Livan is strong, big, but he is also a man, and I think there would be a chance, a big chance for Sandris, considering this explosive power, speed.
Pavlo (Translator): uh yeah he thinks that uh yes absolutely he would have a very good chance to get ready for lebanon yes lebanon is super super strong but uh andre used to have that uh explosive power and because of that explosive power and speed he would have a pretty good chance to beat him out of position i understand i understand anyway so once again
Engin Terzi: How do you say thank you in Ukrainian language? Thank you. Say it again. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Take care, guys. Thank you.
