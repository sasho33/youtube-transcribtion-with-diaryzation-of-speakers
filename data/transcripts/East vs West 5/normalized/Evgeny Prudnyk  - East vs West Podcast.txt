SPEAKER_03: No, my mind is so, when my mind is so tired, I can't sleep. It even takes very calm mind to sleep, fall in sleep, yeah. No Bulgarians for East versus West part this time. I don't know, probably no. I sent message to Samushia, he never answered. Davit Arabuli is probably over 115 kilo.
SPEAKER_03: 115 whenever some time ago i was thinking about him they said that he would be very good match him and rambet they would be head to head what is for crossy is probably he's gonna pull he's gonna pull um yeah the man came can you turn the phone sideways i know i know

SPEAKER_00: Otherwise, I will get in trouble with you all. So, are you the real Timur Mamedov, the Arm Master Timur Mamedov? Champion guy? How much do you weigh? What does he say about Timur Mamedov? He asks if it's real, if Timur Mamedov writes something in the comments, or if it's a fake.
SPEAKER_00: OK, he says I am another one, so it's not that...
SPEAKER_00: It's not a question for me, right? No, no, it's not for you, he's just reading the comments. I understand, I just think that I can answer this question, I'm not aware of it. Mamedov, Timur Mamedov, I've fought with him for a long time. It wasn't him, it was someone else. Someone else, right? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: yeah i i think i think let the whole friend of mine just translate what what you guys told now we decided to have a conversation and we decided to wait until you will learn some russian or ukrainian oh okay understand us okay
SPEAKER_03: i i know i know i learned a lot i know how to say davai davai yeah i also know very important word that's the most important word yeah and then they call for wrist like kissed or something they call for wrist
SPEAKER_03: i don't know anyway so evgeny how are you my friends fine thank you good yeah you you're gonna make a song you're gonna make a song for michael todd yeah yeah under construction huh
SPEAKER_03: i already created yeah wow for michael thought but some later okay okay you're gonna you're gonna sing for him huh wow and do you do you expect an easy match style opera opera style style okay okay
SPEAKER_03: You know, Michael says that next year the match between you and Devon will not happen because Michael is going to beat you, so he is going to pull Devon. Do you agree with this? Michael said that the match between you and Devon will not happen next year because Michael will win.
SPEAKER_01: If you remember, Todd Hutchins said the same about our fight with John Brzenk. Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_03: but what happened with the difference difference is that the one is todd hutchings the other one is michael todd so one is the first one the last name maybe something different yeah i can sing song hey mr todd your head will be for michael anyway so so you're gonna you're gonna beat michael
SPEAKER_01: it's a very uh difficult fight for me if i win him yeah my level uh very high yeah yeah because it's my
SPEAKER_01: weak my weak point uh it's uh fingers and the cupping wrist handle yeah and if i if i can't prepare this good for michael todd and my level
SPEAKER_01: go up because my side pressure my uh top roll it's for my weight it's uh very strong like i can without training yeah it's a bit here again it is almost not possible to
SPEAKER_03: know control michael's tornado with the wrist at the end everyone needs to go up up up up and then finish with the shoulder pressure do you do you uh depend on your powers or do you know how to defeat that that open arm top roll you know he's open on top roll like even pushkar had problem when pushkar won one of the go side pressure even he had problem with michael
SPEAKER_03: so to beat michael usually it is very hard to beat him boom you beat michael but all the time war war big fights big fight so do you know on the center on the center uh table yeah but you need to go must rest on the center up up up up yeah do you know i know it but can you do this can you do this
SPEAKER_01: I think, yeah, I understand the system. I understand if I win quickly, very hard point, five centimeters before the path. Yeah, yeah, very hard point. If it's normal,
SPEAKER_01: grip yeah normal grip start grip and with normal grip this five centimeters it's very great very hard point yeah and if on the center wrist wrestling in the center it's a pull or maybe twist or maybe something to do with him hand on the center
SPEAKER_03: table and after attack yeah yeah yeah so first you need to get the good position position and then you attack but do you do you do you do you expect do you think you have chance to beat him quick or do you think that it will be a tough match
SPEAKER_00: i don't know you don't know i will see it at the table yeah but your your plan to finish quick or you need to work hard i think uh slowly slowly
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you need good endurance, right? Endurance. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I know Michael Todd, but only when he's tired. Yeah. You know, Michael is very experienced about his game. So you really need to come there with a good plan. Because if you only depend on, you know, quick win,
SPEAKER_01: And if you cannot be successful, then you will have some problems there. So let's see. I agree. Or maybe if I have a very quick restart, if I feel my hand and fingers very strong before in time grip.
SPEAKER_01: in time. If I feel strong, my hand, I will try quickly win. Yeah, I think that you need to do some good
SPEAKER_03: table training not not only with the weight because if you don't do table training maybe your hand will be tired you know if the mat stops stops you know because michael has very good endurance very good endurance also can you do shoulder pressure if needed if you need can you do it it's last plan plan last he asks if you can physically do it this is the last plan
SPEAKER_03: yes i do uh and and it is last plan i i remember you and pascal gerard 13 years ago how long was it 10 minutes or eight minutes or how many minutes seven seven minutes wow and which year you are born you were born in 1988 85 85 so you were
SPEAKER_03: Or 1880? No, no. What year were you born? What year were you born? What year was your birthday? 87. 87. So in 2009 Europeans, you were 22 years old. In Bulgaria, European championships. You were in Bulgaria for 22 years, right? It was 2000. Yeah, 22.
SPEAKER_03: 23, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember. I think first was... Maybe 21, but my birthday is September. Okay, okay, okay, yeah. It was in May. I understand. I think there, I think first was Babaev. Who won that match? You won or Pascal won? You won, right? No, Pascal won. Pascal won? Oh, okay. So, Rustam was first, Pascal was second, you were third?
SPEAKER_03: yeah oh yeah i remember the following year in moscow 2010 you and baba have 15 seconds long hook match do you remember uh like 2030 30 10 10 10 10 2010 moscow moscow yeah yeah but we were surprised because baba every year was beating everyone like this
SPEAKER_01: and then that year you stopped him like almost almost one minute 50 seconds you you gave him a hook match yeah we were very surprised and after this fight after this fight i understand uh how to beat russia training i try training only defense training only defense
SPEAKER_01: and after this fight i start training attack and uh 11 uh in 11 2011 in turkish yeah world championship results nothing but 2012
SPEAKER_03: I feel like it was a great stop here. Arm, but you lose only to fall. And in 2013, you beat him finally. Yeah. It was an incredible match. Inside, top roll. It was one of the best matches I have ever seen. One of the best matches I have ever seen. It was incredible.
SPEAKER_00: So my question is, like after 2009, after your match with Pascal, do you remember yourself another match that you had to do this? Which match? He asks after that match, you know, after that match with Pascal, you did press with Pascal and after that did you do press again? And what kind of match was it? Well, I fought with him the same way.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, many times, but all people lose me. They lost to you? They lost to me. Quickly. Because General Pascal has an arthrosis and his hand
SPEAKER_01: not opening arm is not opening right yeah keep here and uh not not opening not opening yeah yeah in this position 90 degree angle all time yeah you will have the same situation with michael yeah yeah no did he understand that you know did he have another match
SPEAKER_03: like that did somebody top roll him that he had to pull like this after that match till now 13 years yes yes many many matches with in this position but a very uh easier win because uh all uh are that cool remind us which one i don't remember which match was it can you remind us
SPEAKER_01: With Timur Mamedov. Oh, Mamedov and you meet him like this? Yeah. Where, Zloty or? Zloty tour, 2012. Alan Makeev. Where? World champion 2017. Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, okay. He doesn't remember all of them, but yeah, he's... I understand. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. So I was just curious about it, that you had that situation. Yeah. So this match is going to be at 115 kilo limit. And last time you were here, about 10 days ago, you weighed 107 kilo.
SPEAKER_00: Now you will be heavier. So it is normal that we can expect even stronger Prudnik than last time, correct? 10 days ago you were 107 kilograms. And now we will probably see you somewhere around 115 kilograms next time, right? And they ask if it will be a stronger version of you.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, my plan is maybe 118 and lose less weight. Lose weight 3 kilos. 3 kilos, no more. No 5 kilos, 3 I think. It's enough. So for sure you will be stronger than last time?
SPEAKER_03: I never weighed. 118. 118. My maximum is 15. Maximum is 15, yeah. But before you come here for Tata Chings, sometime a week ago or 10 days ago, you were 114, right? 14, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So most likely we will see the best shape of Prudnik against Michael.
SPEAKER_03: I hope. I have a question for you. If 115 kilo limit, 253 pounds, I talked with Devon and Devon said that he is right now 260. So he is about 118 kilo. And he said that any moment he can make 253. He said that even today, he said he can make it. So
SPEAKER_03: Pulling against Michael Todd at 115 kilo and pulling against Devon Larratt at 115 kilo. Which match would be harder for you? I don't know. I never pull with Michael and Larratt. Yeah, but what's your guess? What do you think? Listen, I will tell you something. Wait, wait. If I would tell you
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to give you $100,000 if you win and you can choose Lara or Michael, which one would you choose?
SPEAKER_03: You have 10 seconds left and then $100,000 going, going, going. Michael. Oh my, okay, Michael talked, okay. You would choose Michael Todd? Yeah. Okay. I understand.
SPEAKER_03: where is 100 000 i have to win now i mean you answered so late if you didn't answer so that you know i would give you come on prudnik prudnik prudnik prudnik do you love uh
SPEAKER_03: okay i will ask you another thing after you beat michael you said that you're gonna beat right and if you beat michael who do you want to pull next devon yes it will be cool cool yeah um
SPEAKER_03: He promised me that he's going to come to East versus West after he starts pulling. He didn't say exact time. And we didn't talk about that. His promise didn't involve that, you know, like he's going to pull you for sure. But today I wrote to him, you know, I said, if you decide to pull Brutnik, you know, as I offer you, you know, I would love it to be in Istanbul.
SPEAKER_00: he put a heart there, so it sounded like, you know, it's gonna be Istanbul if he pulls against you. He told us that he wrote to Larratt and, you know,
SPEAKER_00: I don't have any specific promises yet, but he said that he would fight with you. And so I pre-agreed with him that it would be in Istanbul, at East vs. West. And, well, Larratt promised that he would fight in East vs. West, but we haven't agreed on the dates yet, and whether it will be with you for sure. But so I pre-agreed, yes.
SPEAKER_03: okay but first i must win uh michael todd it's not uh easy easy yeah people doesn't understand some of the people they think that uh they think that michael is weak they don't know what they are talking about they they don't even realize that this guy has even stopped push cut people may say that okay michael may not be as strong as when he pulled
SPEAKER_03: against Pushkar, but they need to understand that probably you are not as strong as Pushkar either, you know. So what I'm just saying that you beat Michael or you lose against Michael, it is always top match. You know that a war will be there, you know. I don't think there is like possibility. I think that probably the best win against Michael was the Devils win in Dubai that, you know, after one round, the rest was not that hard.
SPEAKER_03: Let's see how it will be. And do you, do you, do you plan to, do you like, are you already analyzing how to beat Michael by watching the videos or like you don't care? Do you plan to watch the video with his match, Misha? Or have you already started watching the video of how to beat him? No, no, no. I like the video when he pulled with Joe Brzenk.
SPEAKER_01: i like video when michael todd pulling with john brzenk oh okay but just remember that match was right after michael and jerry had minutes long match just remember that
SPEAKER_00: but i saw video early early same about 2000
SPEAKER_01: eight maybe okay when you're on hold holding like this holding like this and uh john brzenk always michael todd michael uh after pool after i'll have to and i like him um move like he moved
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but after Poole, probably that match you're talking about was maybe after Pushkar and Michael Poole, probably. Yeah, I think it was after that match. Yeah, but when John beat him, the video that you see that he holds, holds, holds, brings here and then press, that was a very tough match, Jerry and Michael. And then after that, John Poole against him.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah it will be and how about you versus dadikian there there has been a lot of a lot of arguments on the social media i pull him i pull it with him uh in uh after pool yeah in uh and uh now i start to prepare my left hand
SPEAKER_03: I mean, before my left hand, no prepare. No training. Now I start training my left for the jump. Yeah. Yeah. One guy says that that pull was after Tokare versus Michael match. Yeah. So you're going to prepare. But listen, you were 107 kilos. He was 102 kilos. So this time you will be the same weight.
SPEAKER_03: and his left arm was prepared your left arm was not prepared but he pulled a super match with zog you didn't pull super match but you pull with zurab you pull with efek komek after pull and then you pull with him so it is very hard to
SPEAKER_03: guest you know like i think the conditions were very very you had the weight advantage he had a super match his left arm was prepared your left arm wasn't prepared he didn't do after pull but you did after pull with other guys before you pull him i saw on the video you pull with the turkish guy okay my baby uh my baby wake up i must have something right yep
SPEAKER_01: Oh, no, no, no, baby. It's my wife come. It's okay. Yeah. Repeat, please.
SPEAKER_00: Let me just translate it for you. He says that it's hard to say anything specific about the afterpool because you didn't prepare your left hand, Dadikyan did. Dadikyan had a super match with John before that. You didn't fight with your left hand, but you fought with Dadikyan on the afterpool with two or three guys, then with Dadikyan. So it's hard to say a little bit where, who, in which...
SPEAKER_01: i'm special uh pulling with other guys uh i'm prepare and my left hand for the decan because if i pull with him without preparation warm up
SPEAKER_01: without warm up, I think it's very hard for me. But I pull it before with three guys and feel my left hand warm up and after I take the decal. Yeah. I think it helped me for this after pull match. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And how do you see your chance against Adityan? I think it's my chance same like after pool. Many people told about him start, quickly start, but I guess he start very quickly too. And this way same in this situation.
SPEAKER_01: and many people talk about lose weight that you can but i lose my weight too and in after pulling this time there my weight was 108
SPEAKER_01: And the Dikyan, I think it was 107. One hour weight, same two. And the fight with Zhokh, I don't saw that the Dikyan very hard much for him. I don't saw it.
SPEAKER_01: I think we have the same situation. In the real match, we have the same situation, we have weight and all the other conditions.
SPEAKER_03: All the circumstances will be the same. I have a question. Evgeny, to prepare your left arm, will that affect your right arm in any negative way? Is it better for you to prepare yourself with only one arm? Or when you train, focus on both arms, does it affect your right arm in a negative way?
SPEAKER_01: me it's normal training to arm both arms no problem no problem because it's my uh practice all my uh experience arm wrestling my life i guess all time i prepare left and right hand but after top eight i uh only one right arm only one right hand prepared because i don't need left and uh
SPEAKER_01: but now it's okay because when i when i train with one arm i feel pump feel pump and i need sometimes for
SPEAKER_01: yeah to get the pump away yeah without fun yeah and if i train pump in right and i train on left i don't feel pump on right and i can train on the right yeah in the superset yeah even more endurance endurance yeah endurance but when you compete in the competition
SPEAKER_03: you don't say wait i'm gonna do left hand so you don't train you know in the competition the pump is already here you need to hold somebody's hand to make the pump go that side you know in training it's possible but in the competition you need to sit down and get up you know squat you know for your legs so the blood will go away you know yeah um what i was going to ask you
SPEAKER_03: and and will it affect you to have but it's better than relax five minutes yeah yeah yeah yeah the question is in the same night to pull super match two super matches is it is it like bad for you that you can pull first dadikyan and then later uh michael uh is it okay
SPEAKER_03: you did in fact with you did with the uh tobias and then you pull with the matte mask same night uh what kind of experience was it to pull two super matches is it is it bad or is it okay very hard only in my hand because um when i lose uh tobias
SPEAKER_01: I'm very scared. Top roll, matte mask, and worrying. Worrying. Yeah, yeah, worrying, yeah. I feel worrying about my wrist because sporing is easier to do this.
SPEAKER_03: And that is why you gave so hard time to Mesut. Yeah, I understand. And another question, like when you pull Dadikian, how many matches do you want break, you know, between two matches? How many matches do you want? Like you pull Dadikian,
SPEAKER_03: How long time do you want to rest for the Michael match? Because I will do as you need because you are pulling two super matches while your opponents are pulling only one super match. So it is going to be as you say. I think 10 matches. 10 matches? The more the better.
SPEAKER_03: what's that the more the better the more matches okay so you want one as much as possible okay so looks like you're gonna pull one of the earliest matches because there will be a total of 12 matches and the last match as always John Bersink match another question for you if if Oleg Petrenko comes in very good shape what is his chance against John Bersink
SPEAKER_01: If very good shape, I think he like Algorbaev, maybe some same like Algorbaev. But I don't think that he is good shape. I think that I see him on the Instagram. Evgeny he is not competing, he is always posting videos from the gym.
SPEAKER_03: where the training, you know. So now he has, whenever I offer him, he had three and a half months from early August till the November 19. So almost three and a half months. I think for a young guy, I think it's even more than enough, three and a half months. When you come here to Pulmorezo, you just started training like two months ago or something. You remember? Yeah. And you were in incredible shape in February.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I trained for two months, I had a clear form, and Petrenko trained for three months. If three months and Petrenko takes many trainings and many shape-forms,
SPEAKER_01: see like 50 50 or i think yeah it's uh same john brzenk maybe more or you think that petrenko may have more chance if he was he will be in good shape yes so you are saying that if petrenko comes if petrenko comes in his best shape he has a little little bit more chance than john if he comes in best shape i understand
SPEAKER_01: I understand. Yeah. So because some people, you know, but maybe no, because our buyer has a quick start slowly. And for this better. Yeah, same 5050. So you are saying that
SPEAKER_03: Ongarbaev and John about the power was 50-50, but because Ongarbaev was so quick, John was slow. So that is why Ongarbaev had advantage. But you are saying that Petrenko is not as quick as Ongarbaev. So that is why John will be able to use his power. So it is very close. Yeah, I understand. And another question. I invited Rustam Babaev and Rustam will answer me next month.
SPEAKER_03: but he accepted but he he told me just wait for september to see what happened if under 100 kilo rustam bavev and iraq zirakashvili in january how do you see that much good match 100 kilo iraq yes but i think rustam win
SPEAKER_03: if he will be in good shape. Rustam has more than five months. He has more than five months to get ready. Yeah. So you think Rustam is the favorite against lrakli? Yeah. I don't see something open raised to Rustam.
SPEAKER_01: Ruslan's hand is strong, right? Very strong hand. Here, very strong and good position and with him, lever. He can use his arm very good. Lever, lever, lever, lever. He can use his lever.
SPEAKER_01: and uh and then we did and after yeah pressure from here right here down here yeah yeah it's by the pressure and i think uh i thought iraqi can't do anything i understand uh sg records uh roman thank you for your super chat we love and support prudnik
SPEAKER_03: This is. And. Yep. So that that that is also another interesting match. And how do you see Morozov and Revaz? Yep. Do you think do you think that Morozov now? Little bit more stronger than when he pulled against you.
SPEAKER_01: right now you think he's stronger now not not stronger than you but now his level is getting up you think morozov yeah i think
SPEAKER_01: that Morozov little bit chance percent for win. I think Lutidze has a strong side pressure, but if Morozov keep him, take him.
SPEAKER_01: wrist agree i think uh morozov win do you think morozov has chance to hook him in hook yeah and maybe not uh top row because lutitsa doesn't have a good wrist and fingers he has a now he has a
SPEAKER_01: more many slowly point uh weak point he has a many weak point now morozov has weak points no it's a very great side pressure but if somebody if somebody hooks him quick then he may lose right
SPEAKER_03: I think in hook he can win the top role, yes. I understand. Do you think that if Revaz continues training, just say one more year or two more years, very seriously? Yeah, it will be like... Do you think he has a chance to pull against Levan? Do you think he has potential or not?
SPEAKER_03: yeah he has potential he like us future live on in the future yeah so you are saying that revas is big enough strong enough if he trains trains trains he may be a problem maybe for uh levan in the future yeah yeah yeah yeah i agree i agree
SPEAKER_03: Let's see. Let's see how it will be. And how do you see Tobias? And they say that Tobias now is even more stronger. His trainer told me. And he said that everything is stronger now. And he said that in November, Tobias will be even more and more stronger. You think Tobias has a chance against Dzeranov? On left?
SPEAKER_03: right right because he is very quick guy do you think that uh possible that he may top roll zero or no yeah yeah i don't know for shape uh form uh but it's uh
SPEAKER_01: interesting on tobias will will pull in uh will pull uh you know with him what what tobias versus tobias pulling who um does i don't know right arm at the east west uh five five yeah in november yeah it will be better now it's even heavier
SPEAKER_00: He is even heavier than last time in May. Tobias? Do you understand, Zheka? What? Well, that Tobias will be even heavier than he was and that yes, he will fight Dzeranov now. So, why did you come here? Say hello. Hey! Hello! Bye-bye!
SPEAKER_03: if if now tobias is 10 stronger than the last time he he may have chance against this i don't know
SPEAKER_01: How many percent? If Tobias gets 10% more, does he have a chance against Dzeranov? Is it going to be on the right? I don't even know. He's already strong on the left, Tobias. Or not? Well, yes, but he also has a good right. Is Tobias strong on the left hand or right two?
SPEAKER_03: stronger uh left right right right i i they say they say that his left is stronger but now his right left both strong very strong his his trainer said that he is even ready to against gennady his trainer said that he is very strong right now then okay okay i think uh with zirano and the tobias
SPEAKER_03: It's interesting. It will be an interesting fight. I understand. And there is Rick Harrod. Thank you for your support, my friend. Engin, thanks for all your work to make East versus West events. Thank you, my friend. Thank you for your support. Thank you to all who support me to organize these events.
SPEAKER_03: um yeah so in short you are saying that your chance with that again is close 50 50 this is how you are saying 55 45 for you
SPEAKER_03: okay okay yeah and and right arm with michael uh michael uh 50 50. wow that's very risky match for you then huh yeah you say you say you say 55
SPEAKER_03: because you know that 100 you will be able to use your power with michael you cannot be so confident because you don't know you don't have so much experience yeah about how to pull against him yeah yeah wow let's see let's see how it will be i just can't wait you versus michael yeah so you are saying that if the distance is uh longer is better for you so you are saying that
SPEAKER_03: I need to put your Dadika match very early in the event. And I need to put your Michael match at the end of the event, right before John Brzenk versus Petrenko match. Yeah, I understand. Yeah. Okay. So I will do that. I will do that. Some people are okay if there is three, four matches in between. They are okay. But you want a long time, as long as possible. Okay. I understand.
SPEAKER_00: probably agree with uh rooting because last time i pulled two super matches at the monster factory and they give me uh three matches in between was not enough for me yeah i i like more time between with different arms if it's same arm maybe but if different terms are like all the time you can can get me
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Anyway, so John Bersink will not be attending the January event. He said he needs to rest. I think his November event will be the last one before he takes a break for January. In January, he will rest. He will rest. And then in January, we will see
SPEAKER_03: Ongarbaev versus Tatachins, the title match. I will ask you something, Evgeny. If Rustem competes, if Ongarbaev competes, lrakli competes, everyone competes under 100 kilos, and if John competes, just say that we do a little bit of tolerance. John, in the last event, he had a little bit of fever. He had been ill for a few weeks. He got cold.
SPEAKER_03: Who do you think would be the best guy under 100 kilos? You are the best under 110 kilos so far, but who do you think is the strongest guy under 100 kilos? Sotka. If this person goes there... Todd Hutchins? Todd Hutchins is there.
SPEAKER_01: no no no he's asking question oh yeah i think if come back i think in the good shape yeah he can beat uh hutchins he can beat gorbaev
SPEAKER_03: and maybe he can beat petrenko i think petrenko or babaev so you are saying that you in your opinion petrenko or babaev are the strongest one but you you also said that maybe i'll go by three but three petronka petrenko and john will be 50 50. i think petrenko can't beat babaev maybe can or cannot if can't beat on gerbaev
SPEAKER_01: But Angerbaev can beat Petrenko. Because of the things? Because start. For Petrenko, start with Angerbaev. For Petrenko, it's a bad problem. For Babayev, start with Angerbaev, no problem. Because both have very good starts.
SPEAKER_01: I think no problem, because it's not a finger start, it's a stronger starting hook. And I think Petrenko can… Babayev also can topple when he wants. But this not top roll is a very short lever.
SPEAKER_03: It's not same to pro like on their wife. Yeah. There is, there is a, there is a, uh, uh, question. Thank you for your super chat. Sultan. What, uh, what is Prudnik's chance against Ermes? You need to be heavier.
SPEAKER_01: need to be a little heavier do you need to gain a little bit more weight or 118 kilo prudnik 130 kilo hermes how would be 18. i think it's uh normal it's the same for me it's a good shape 120 180.
SPEAKER_01: it's my best shape will be and uh i can uh pull it with hermes yeah i think yeah like this yeah it's uh it's my thing i think yeah okay there is another one faro ramses thank you for your super chat
SPEAKER_00: says prudnik is awesome love from austria from austria or australia austria austria say hello anyway so you have a super match this weekend with leonidas with left arm
SPEAKER_03: yeah 20 august 20 august yeah anyways so i i wish you do i wish you the best and another question as of now uh how do you see jerry versus hermes oh it's very hard for for uh prediction
SPEAKER_01: very hard because of jerry's style yeah yeah yeah very hard because jerry has a good side pressure and uh good endurance and uh i think maybe first around uh i think somebody at ms can beat jerry second round it will be
SPEAKER_01: very hard and the third round Jerry stopped and after I think Ermes will feel a pump and tired in Radia Moscow and yeah yeah you're saying I understand Ermes says that
SPEAKER_01: Evgeny 85% of Ermes can beat... Or if Ermes use very quickly start, maybe he can beat him 0-3-0-4-0. Only if he will use quickly start. Speed, okay. Okay, Vinyar Rundholde. Thank you for your super chat. He says, he's asking you, Prudnik.
SPEAKER_01: Who has the best chance against Levan in the world? Who has the best chance? Now, I think maybe it's Gennady Kviklinia.
SPEAKER_01: Because he knows his hand, he knows his arm. He pulled it with him all the time on the training. I don't think that Gennady will win, I don't think. But it will be a...
SPEAKER_03: yarki yarki i don't fight yarki celebrity no it's gonna be a bright bright fight yeah bright fight right it will be a bright fight i understand and paulo do you have any anything that you are curious and ask uh prudnik i know you came here to translate but still
SPEAKER_00: like would you like to ask him something are you curious about something no but uh i would agree probably with uh prudnik about uh who is the best uh chances nobody have chance against levan as of today but probably queen will give the the best fight and as he said it's going to be the uh most uh entertaining fight if could win you will do that i understand yep
SPEAKER_03: and and uh i'm gonna one one and maybe hermes gasparini if he his weight will be 150 or seven or 60 kilo i have a question for you okay do you think that after a point still getting more more more more do you think that it makes you still more stronger
SPEAKER_03: Like do you think that Ermes can put 30 kilo more muscle? Like do you think that he can gain 30 kilo? You said 160. He is now 130, 127. Do you think it's possible to gain 30 kilo muscle? If not muscle, then that 30 kilo, does it mean that it makes you stronger? For Ermes, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: understand yeah okay the question is if you beat michael uh who who do you want to pull in january if you beat him yes
SPEAKER_01: Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Or maybe.
SPEAKER_03: Dave Chaffee. Dave Chaffee, yeah. Pharaoh Ram says, I didn't ask this question. Which question I ask the same? Justin stop bullshitting. So I think that Dave Chaffee versus you would be a good one. Would you want to pull Dave Chaffee? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Like the question is, would you want to pull someone from North America or you want to pull from somewhere from Europe or it doesn't matter? It doesn't matter. Oh, it doesn't matter. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But, but do you agree that, do you agree that if you beat Michael, like, do you think that you should be now from now on, we need to set you with the super heavy weights, not under 110 kilos. Do you agree that?
SPEAKER_01: michael i think i can pull them with a heavy weight yeah okay so basically basically you are saying that you are ready to pull against anyone except leon
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. And after, if I beat all sportsmen, all sportsmen before Levan. And then you want to pull Levan? I will be first for Levan versus Levan. Okay, okay. It's my plan.
SPEAKER_03: So you have a plan, you have a dream to become number one in the world. Destroyed, my plan destroyed all sportsmen before Levan. Yeah, but do you also have a dream to beat Levan as well? Dream or dream? Dream?
SPEAKER_03: It's not dream, it's future. Future reality? Reality future. Okay. You told me I should call you SAC. Thank you for your super chat. I cheer for the West, but I am a big Evgeny Prudnik fan. Thank you, thank you, my friend. Yeah, that's good, that's good.
SPEAKER_03: you have you have some plans to become uh number one in the world if you can do this i think you will be the first person um i think devon also at a point became number one in the world when he was about 240 250 pounds i must i must say that the competition at the supreme weight today is much bigger and harder than that time do you agree paulo
SPEAKER_03: Do you agree that the super heavyweight competition today with Levan, Revaz, Morozov, Dave Sheffield, Laletin, Salaev, Kurdesha, all of them, you know, Michael, Devon, today is harder than the 2008 point that we had Denis first time almost. I think very hard for me.
SPEAKER_01: it's uh only his style right uh yeah huh because of your style you know whole arm and then you know low low hand top style and uh and him lever lever yeah but uh after our our fight uh i have a plan how can i beat him and i train and uh
SPEAKER_03: um after michael todd i think i have more chance for religion after fight with michael todd yeah sultan no need to ask these kind of questions my friends um please you know if you can take the question take your money just please no need such questions yeah you were saying something
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I want to answer your question to me about super heavyweight. Yes, it is. And we are as sportsmen, humanity is growing. If you remember in 2000s, the deepest classes was probably 80 and 90 kilos. And ever since we're growing. So now in the United States, the deepest class is super heavyweights always.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, recently and two years ago at Michigan State, it's one of the biggest tournaments in the United States by volume. It's close to 500 entries usually. So it's an amateur super heavyweight class is 30 people. How many? 30.
SPEAKER_00: 30 okay a year ago it was 32 and this year it was 26 or seven something like that i mean it's huge yes we are growing and because the classes are getting so deep yes absolutely it's uh it's much more competition and uh much harder uh to be a number one in superheroes that's why they stay around 10 kilos
SPEAKER_03: Anyways, somebody is asking where your match will be held with Leonidas. Is it going to be in Germany? In Germany, yes. Germany, okay. Okay, guys, just ask, you know, armless and related questions, please. You know, just... Anyway, so thank you very much.
SPEAKER_03: Again, it has been more than one hour and hope that you know I before the matches, I will have another YouTube program with you and Michael and together and you'll be ready. Michael Michael is going to be ready for you. I talked with him and he really wants that shield. You remember the shield that I gave you?
SPEAKER_01: What's a shield? A shield is a shield. Ah, he needs a shield, yes. I understand, he will always be preparing for me, he really needs a shield, right? Yes. He needs a shield, right? Yes. He's going to beat you and take the shield.
SPEAKER_03: he likes to he likes to collect those kind of trophies those kind of uh bells you know and if i win what can i take him no you're gonna you need some before the match you put your shield to the center the winner takes it because that that is not your shield you need to win three title match
SPEAKER_03: that when you win three times that is permanently yours when you come next time i will give you a new one but for now you need to win three times when you come to here to istanbul you need to bring that okay we will pull on shield yeah yeah no no
SPEAKER_01: uh first time it's uh todd hutchins second time is todd michael and third time i didn't know maybe the sportsman and uh after i take a sh it's shale to my and i take uh yes yes that one too yeah the helmet helmet yeah also give you the helmet
SPEAKER_03: And you need to beat someone with his name needs to have like Todd, either last name or first name. Now Todd Hutchings, now Michael Todd, the third guy needs to be something with Todd. You need to find someone. If not Todd, I'm not going to give you. Tell Michael Todd, I don't need only shield. I need a helper. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And, and,
SPEAKER_03: He really believes he's going to beat you. And then people think that, you know, you are a heavy favorite. But when we asked you, you said 50-50. And you see this match even harder than your left-hand match against Dadikyan. So I really hope that people, the fans, will realize that Michael Todd is a very, very, very bad dude. Very dangerous. One second. With Dadikyan, we have a...
SPEAKER_01: title match or no yes title match hundred thank you if i win two i uh uh get uh
SPEAKER_03: No. One is right-hand title match. Only right. So you need to win three left-hand title matches to take the shield and the helmet and three right-hand. If I win, Michael, who next in the 110? Who is next? I am thinking that, I don't know, maybe if Sandris beats Matt Mask or if maybe lrakli or Ongarbev,
SPEAKER_03: 110. Yeah, maybe Ongar Baya. But if Ongar Baya pulls against you, you know that the 5 kilo allowance is only if two guys agree. And I think that Ongar Baya will not agree with that weight allowance. So if he pulls against you, he's going to pull in 110 kilo, not 115, 12, 13, nothing. 110. So maybe it will be Ongar Baya. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: Somebody tells me to give us a sword. I prefer not to give because that is an attack weapon, while the helmet
SPEAKER_00: and the shield is more for protection you know so i think i don't know i can give sword too but how do you think paulo do you think that it would do do you think it would look nice to give sword no no i think uh at the local tournaments inside the country yes you can or may do it but if it's international tournament they will be asked on uh you know on every uh
SPEAKER_00: border they cross for you know crossing the border with the weapon plus the flights and stuff like that and yes the spiritual uh of the actual weapon is you know you're right not a good idea not a good idea yeah yeah yeah i mean they they give me as a present they give me a samurai sword like katana is in this code but if it is not sharpened
SPEAKER_03: you can carry, you know, with the luggage part, not where you are. Yeah, I understand that. Yeah, but if it is sharpened, they don't allow you to, no matter what, they don't allow you. Not to create more problems for athletes with all the international situation now and crossing the borders, I would not probably. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think in January, Rustam Babaev versus lrakli,
SPEAKER_03: and Ongar Baya versus Tata Chings. So these are 400 kilo. Ongar Baya versus Tata Chings is a title match. And Rushdanbabaev lrakli is just for ranking. And I think that, you know, also it's up to John what he thinks because he's number two. And then, yeah, that we will see. If Ongar Baya wins against Tata Chings, I think the lrakli versus
SPEAKER_03: Rusta match would be very good idea about next title match for 100 kilo. And Evgeny, you know, when Ongarbev took John's wrist, John a little bit resisted like this. Do you realize that he stopped? But we know that in this position, Tatachin is more stronger than John with no wrist. So even if Ongarbev takes the wrist,
SPEAKER_03: Todd Hutchings is in this position. How do you see Todd Hutchings versus Ongarweev? But remember, this is under 100 kilo. How do you see this match? I don't feel strong side pressure. Todd Hutchings in this position. But you were kind of, I think you were too strong. I think you were, Evgeny.
SPEAKER_03: i think i think like no no disrespect but i think you are in my opinion right now it's stronger than i think uh on that this is my opinion i would like to ask to do the chat guys how do you see prudent again on that way right now i would like to ask people
SPEAKER_03: no no no i said prudnik and on that way because you said that you didn't feel so much side pressure but maybe it is because you are so strong but he is on that way as strong as you you know in this position that that is what i would like to uh i would like to hear yeah we will see with uh todd hutchins uh we will see shape on goodbye
SPEAKER_01: Okay, and another question. The Ongarbaev and lrakli, who do you think is going to win that match if they ever pull? Oh, very interesting. Very interesting position. Both sportsmen.
SPEAKER_01: But I think maybe on Gorbayev because he has a weekly start. I understand. You remember, you just said that... Yeah, you say, okay, go ahead. And more experience, more experience. Yeah, the thing is, remember you said that you didn't feel so much?
SPEAKER_03: the side pressure of Tatachins, but remember Tatachins versus lrakli match? Yeah. I think that the reason you didn't feel so much, because I think your wrist is so dominant to control his pronator, you control here. So you really cut the connection. If he had a little bit more pronator, you would feel more on your hand and wrist. If you realize that when lrakli wanted to go out,
SPEAKER_03: he didn't have super good wrist control. At the end, he even lost a little bit his wrist. So that is what I am saying, that I think you are stronger. Your arm is stronger. Your wrist is stronger. You are, I think, very, very strong. So that is why I expect Ongarbeye versus Taka Ching match to be a very tough one, very tough one. I expect a war because even he took John's wrist,
SPEAKER_03: didn't go down so quickly you know and jones totally risk loss you know like this i don't think he is as effective as uh tatashins and and you say that ongar wave is gonna beat iraqi if they pull in your opinion okay yeah it's possible
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, there are a lot of matches, a lot of good matches. And then there are many of them are waiting. Like Margarit, what's his name? Petrenko. Petrenko Margarit, yeah. Yeah. See, that guy is also strong. How is he compared to Rustamen Petrenko?
SPEAKER_01: He's very strong, but he doesn't have endurance. But he has a very big hand, like Levan. Not Levan, but the same, but closer. But how do you compare him?
SPEAKER_03: Oleg Petrenko, Rustam Babaev and other guys. If Petrenko comes here and competes, can he be number one or no? Margarine? Yes. Now I don't know, but in the last time he has a shape, form and yes. And now I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: I wrote him. He said he's ready. He's going to compete. He's planning to compete in the World Championships in Antalya in October. He's training, really training. So what I just said, if he's in very good shape, what is his level? You said his endurance is not good, but where do you think that he is? Justin tell me, what is his level?
SPEAKER_01: If he is already trained, what level do you think he will be? I didn't pull with him when he was in shape. I fought with him when he was in his best shape.
SPEAKER_00: yeah evgeny saying that uh he doesn't know for sure because he never pulled him uh margarine when he was in his best shape so he did not answer that question he doesn't have any any any opinion while watching from outside like can he do something against guys like on that way iraqli how how could we compare him against those guys
SPEAKER_00: Yes, with lrakli, yes.
SPEAKER_01: because he has a big hand. But with Angorbaev, I don't think because Angorbaev quickly and Margarine don't have a start very slowly.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but it didn't look like this when he pulled Revaz at the Moldova event and John, he just like curled them and beat them. Also this year, I saw him beating, like last year, Romagna. He won easily the World Championships. I also saw him one round, I think he beat Rustam Babaev in Moldova, right? In Moldova 2018. In the, I think, Open class or something he beat him, right? Rustam.
SPEAKER_00: i don't remember either i've been watching moldova for a couple times but i i don't remember yeah yeah in the moldova 2018 event i remember probably in the overalls probably
SPEAKER_03: open glass I think after 95 I think I saw him beating Rustam very quickly he took him there and Rustam was just trying to stop him here and yeah I don't think that he I think his forearm is very strong and yeah see there is one guy says that here Petrenko has some pins on Prudnik as well some some guy says that he beat you is it true
SPEAKER_00: again you broke up a little bit can you repeat for me because i didn't hear it too yeah there is one guy says that uh petro has wins against prudnik is that true yes one time
SPEAKER_01: but I feel pain in the hand and arm injury. Who won? You won? No, no. Margarine had one win over Prudnik, but Prudnik has some pain and injury in the hand. Where was it? When was it? 2020, after eight...
SPEAKER_03: Top eight. Oh, okay. Okay. I understand. I understand. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. So anyway, so also I saw Neil pick up in the chat. Hello, Neil. And hope to see you as my guest, my friends. I couldn't before that I invited, but the time wasn't right for you. Anyway, so do you want to say anything more before we close, Evgeny?
SPEAKER_01: Do you want to say anything? Any message for Michael Todd? No, nothing. Michael, say hello and prepare good. And I wait. I'm waiting. Okay. He probably will hear that.
SPEAKER_00: um and paulo yeah no it's a it's nice to see you guys and i cannot wait for uh next east versus west and uh yeah i'm watching this and i'm enjoying our conversations too and uh yeah thank you thank you and yeah good luck do you have your own opinion before we close between between michael and brudnick how do you see the match uh
SPEAKER_00: yes it's very close match and i think that prudnik is a slight favorite but uh do not underestimate michael he is very experienced and very weird style and uh yeah i i've been pulling on uh practices michael a few times and it's something different from what you can expect even from what you can imagine it is yeah you you said that you pull him a little bit after uh after pool and
SPEAKER_03: Is it a smart idea to try to get position before you try to pin him, right?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, but it's not that only press will work. It's not true. There is a few possible scenarios where you can beat Michael, but it's a few possible scenarios how you can lose to Michael. But yeah, center work is important, but the most important is that center.
SPEAKER_00: you know as soon as you start putting that center you cannot beat michael when you lost your angle so you you need to keep him your side yes it has to be on your side and uh you cannot if you lost this angle if you're out you cannot press king's move over king's move michael wins you know so it's yeah i have opinion and that but uh
SPEAKER_00: michael's pronator sometimes get a little weaker so his pronator may get his weak side if you will be able to take his pronator a little bit he's done he's all it's it's over it's not that easy you know i understand anyway so thank you very much guys and thanks to everyone who watched us
SPEAKER_03: and you all take care i will have other guests as well you know and hope to see you guys again thank you very very much paulo special thanks to you my friends thank you thank you you're welcome yeah yep so you take care yourself take care guys thank you
