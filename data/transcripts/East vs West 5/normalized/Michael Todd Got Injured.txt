SPEAKER_01: Hello, guys. Justin one second.
SPEAKER_00: Hello, Oleg. Hello, Mike. Hello, everyone. Sorry. I have been ill. And can I get Devon and Prudnik? Yeah. Hello, guys. Hello. Great to see you all. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: we old guys are getting hurt when the age is Jerry hurt his shoulder
SPEAKER_00: Alijan Muradogba, I'm in such a shame. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Michael got injured, you know, already, but he tried, he tried. He even called me. He said there is a risk, but he still wants to pull.
SPEAKER_00: about his bicep yesterday. But he was thinking that it was like 10, 20% of possibility. And he said he wants to pull. He thinks that it was good opportunity and he really believed in himself. He was gonna win.
SPEAKER_00: But today, when the doctor told him the possibility for him to have a complete bicep tore, he said it's 50%. So, I mean, he didn't want to risk himself. So it's normal. I wouldn't either.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, we need to understand that injuries are part of the professional sports, especially when you are getting older. I know from myself, my doctor also told me that it is only 20% of here, this bicep, part of the bicep is holding.
SPEAKER_00: About Devon and Prudnik. Some people say names like Davit Dadikian. I talked with his manager, Bob Ken. He said after the event, Davit stopped training at all. And he's left, he's already injured. And he's planning to make a comeback in...
SPEAKER_00: next june and iraqli iraqi said he just started train he just started train and he's gonna get ready for january to pull on garbaev and
SPEAKER_00: And Ongar Bayev got ill at WAF. That's why he couldn't compete the right arm competition. In the same place, I also got ill. And Gennady also just started training. Gennady just also started training. I mean, anything is possible. Anything is possible. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Devon Lara takes magic mushroom. He said that Dave takes magic mushrooms. Dave, I don't know, Dave does. Dave has a big heart. The guy is, I don't know, the guy has no fear. The guy has a huge heart. That's Dave Chaffee. You Americans should be very proud of him.
SPEAKER_00: And but I'm telling you, all of them, all of them have big heart. You know, John has Michael has Michael. Michael is not scared of anyone.
SPEAKER_00: anyone ever ever ever writes that you know Michael just finds excuse or something that person is out of his mind Michael was looking this is such a big opportunity to win the title and he had good chance I'm not sure how much but he had good chance yeah and
SPEAKER_00: no i just talked with his manager daddy ken's right arm is not ready i mean not only right arm but he's not ready he's not training he has 25 days he will not be i mean the truth is if you are pulling someone like prudnik that that short notice is it's same as like you trying to pull
SPEAKER_00: levan you know you don't want to take a last minute you know decision you want to get ready for that so prudnik for his weight category is that dangerous um thank you guys i can read all of them i'm i'm ill and and um i'm trying to accept
SPEAKER_00: oh okay hungar baby sick dennis versus prudy i don't think have i spoken to the devil yet yes i did i have spoken to the devil but it is not that easy it's not that easy it is not that easy to get a deal
SPEAKER_00: such a short time between prudnik and devon yeah but i i have yes i have spoken with devon and i have spoken with prudnik and after this live i will continue trying some other things but who knows
SPEAKER_00: Devon is asking for more money for such a short notice. I think he says, no, it's not that. It's not that. It is just not that simple, you know. It is not that simple. Yeah. No, at Prudnik's weight class, only Michael Todd and Devon Arad from North America in his weight category. In supers, you know, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: what about what's what about jones match is it cancelled also no jones match is not cancelled um
SPEAKER_00: No, he's not scared. Why didn't you set a competition or joke? I mean, why do I need to set every name that you mentioned? Maybe you said if you like, I mean, to see, you know, you said, why do I need to do what you tell me to do? There are many. John, Engin, Margarine, Poos, Hutchings in January. We will see, my friend. I will talk with Hutchings still.
SPEAKER_00: um okay he says that for the next video
SPEAKER_00: That video, the psychopath video, injured Michael. That's what he says. Hey, Engin, crazy news with Michael. Monster Michael. Yeah, but the replacement for Jerry was good, you know. Dave Chaffee. But now, let's see what to do with the Prudnik match. Prudnik. Who do you think is the best opponent for Prudnik that would be insane?
SPEAKER_00: I think that Devon Narat would be incredible. Devon Narat would be incredible. But remember that Prudnik is 100% ready. Tobias is injured. Tobias, his own match with Morozov is cancelled, you know. If he could pull, I would... I would already, I mean, keep his match.
SPEAKER_00: Matt's Beats. Get well quickly. How do you see Georgii Shvetka's chances in the future? It's very possible. Thank you for your super chat. Very possible. And Living Niles. I don't know how to...
SPEAKER_00: So I don't know what that means my friend. If it works for you, when you try then you are golden. Is this a cold medicine my friend? Thank you for your super chat.
SPEAKER_00: Prudnik Alijan Murado maybe left arm he would be good match but now with right arm my friend Alijan is under 95 kilo he told me his trainer told me he was 92 kilo a lot of messages I will ban that clown what clown my friend what did the guy say I don't know I didn't understand
SPEAKER_00: Um, okay, I make you moderator. I don't know which class and what. Um, and you want a vision is versus West. And in recent video, John said,
SPEAKER_00: He's calling your names. Okay. Justin ban that idiot then. In a recent video, John said that number two in the world. Why? After recent training, what do you think? He's talking about, he said, Devon is number two, right? That's what you say. I mean, it's possible, yeah. Samushia versus Prudnik. Samushia is 90 kilos. Prudnik is 115 kilos. Same weight? Yes. As of now, no way.
SPEAKER_00: um david versus britney is a huge match that deserves months of trolling videos i don't know and in recent videos john said devin's number two yeah he can be he may be he may be devon is an incredible shape yeah but again you know devon needs to train with some uh john needs to train with
SPEAKER_00: hermes and some other thing some other guys that who are candidate for number two so that he could have even a better opinion maybe he's right maybe not we don't know yet um morozov versus prudnik morozov is pulling uh pulling uh revas he didn't get injured i mean i know this has been discussed already but
SPEAKER_00: Who should Tsar pull first before Levan? I don't know. You need to discuss with King of the Table because they are the ones who will organize. I cannot invite the Russians. I was in the WAF walls, you know, still they don't allow me to invite. Thank you, brother. Yeah, Sunday discipline, mask and
SPEAKER_00: I don't think all of us can come. I don't know. I just want to see lrakli. lrakli, I don't think chance can do anything to, no disrespect, but there are a few people.
SPEAKER_00: What about Chen Shou, Halid? Oh, Halid, yes. Chen Shou and Halid, yeah, it would be a nice match, but it doesn't replace the Prudnik match. Tarasaitis versus Prudnik. Oh, come on, guys. Justin let's be serious, you know. I'm organizing a great event, and the matches are, some matches are getting canceled because of the injuries, and we are just making fun.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Ongarbev versus Prudnik would be good, but Prudnik couldn't... Ongarbev couldn't compete even in right-arm WAF championships because he was ill. He got ill. I will tell you something for sure. The next match of Devon Larratt will be against Evgeny Prudnik.
SPEAKER_00: either in November 19th or January. Devon Larratt's first match will be Evgeny Prudnik. So you make yourself ready for that match. Both Kurdes and Ravas has very good potential. Prudnik and Devon will pull hundreds,
SPEAKER_00: 15 kg category, not 110. I talked with Devon this evening, you know, the evening for me, you know, they're probably much earlier and he said he is only 261 pounds. He is only 8 pounds over 253, which is 115 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: Caleb Williams, I will donate my left arm if Devon pulls. Thank you for your support, my friend. Thank you, Engin. Devon versus Brutnik. Yeah, that much is going to happen. It's all about when. But I will tell you something. I cannot say that November 19 is out of option.
SPEAKER_00: for Devon versus Prudnik. I'm not saying it's going to happen, but it is not out of option. It is not out of option. So, don't be surprised. Devon't be surprised, but that, how to say, we're talking about Ungarbev, and Ungarbev just wrote to me. I see his message at the corner. Let me put it down. I will answer him after live. Um...
SPEAKER_00: I don't think Dennis would pull. I think Dennis is committed to Dubai event in February. I don't think he's going to pull anyone before that. No, if there is an opponent for Levan, I'm sure Levan would pull every three months.
SPEAKER_00: But remember, when Levan is pulling, people actually need to go and watch him. They need to really believe that this match is a good match for him, you know. Okay, another super shed deal, 87. Sorry, I can't read so good, but Brittany Graham is going to take him all the way to the top at heavyweight. He is a monster. Not seen a lot of people handle Katashniks like...
SPEAKER_00: his weight, yeah. Who would you like to see compete for Swiss next year? Many people. When Gennady coming back? Gennady is coming back for January.
SPEAKER_00: And again, in honesty, how strong is Ferit in your opinion that you can compare him strength? I don't know. He looks right up there. But, you know, I will tell you something. You know, whenever you see this very strong super heavyweight competing against each other,
SPEAKER_00: the weight difference is by a few percent you know in different directions of strength application and it is not easy to calculate that without people pulling but I believe that except Levan Ferit could pull against anyone because he is now going up
SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure if Denis would accept. Yeah, Belgian commentator would be good, but
SPEAKER_00: He would just, sometimes he doesn't know what he's saying. The other day on live, he called Italy, France, and Belgium, pussy countries. He called them. And I think he said this way. I think, yeah, I think he said this way. I was like, what are you talking about? Come on, man. I mean, he has to be, sorry, but more respectful sometimes. Calling all those countries.
SPEAKER_00: Hello to Texas. Ferit is not ready. Ferit is not ready, brother. When am I coming back? I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: This is a channel that I made with a bottle. My young people know you better. You're right, brother. Believe me, I'm so energetic that I'm going to these country recognition competitions. Believe me, I want it very much, but even so, my tension is high. Harvard Getty vs. Prudnik. Do you think they could be a good representation? I think that Prudnik would be too much for him.
SPEAKER_00: Um, Marseille versus Prudnik. Marseille just started training, I think. Um, have you called Devon yet? Plan on calling him? Yes, I talk with him, Celeb. Yeah. Thank you for your support. I talk with him. Um, there are some things that may be personal. I don't know. But, um...
SPEAKER_00: Devon may be pulling on November 19th against Evgeny Prudnik. You ask me what's the possibility of this happening? I can say it is 50%.
SPEAKER_00: 50% I believe that we may see Devon in Istanbul to Pulpurutnik. And the 50% we will not see him on November 19th, but we will see him in January event. But it is 50%. Does Devon want this? Devon wants, 100%. Yes, no, it's not COVID, my friend. I got cold at the WAF.
SPEAKER_00: um i i did the antigen test at home twice yesterday and today both was both were negative but i will do one more tomorrow because sometime it shows late you know result but alex is gonna pull left arm in january as well but there are a lot of things
SPEAKER_00: And what do you think about Ermes versus Dave? That I'm an organizer, I can't have prediction, but it is a very good match. It can go either way. If the match of Devon happens in November 19, you, who you pick to win, Devon or Brodden again, I don't know if Devon 100% prepared. I mean, Devon is already in incredible shape. Already in incredible shape. He's already very, very good. Already very good.
SPEAKER_00: I just turned in. I heard Michael told, will not be able to come. Yes, Timmy. Yes, my friend. And you may be prudent again. Daddy can. I asked to Daddy Can's manager, Bob Ken. He said Daddy Can is not training since the King of the Table at all. And he is not planning to compete till like next June or something.
SPEAKER_00: The only thing that we need to accept, not only Michael, Michael, Jerry, myself, even Devon, I don't know how Devon is doing that hours of training, you know, John, you know, we need to realize that we should not put, push our limits, you know, except on the competition day. I think we need to go...
SPEAKER_00: Easy. I'm not saying that easy, but not 100%. Not trying to break the records or something, you know. Like even like staying 90%. Like sometimes you train at your 90%. It doesn't mean that you cannot do hundreds or maybe even 105%. You understand? You just don't do it. You understand? Justin do not risk yourself.
SPEAKER_00: But you do it at the competition. So because that is a place to take that risk, but not training. When you are young, you know, you can push it. When you get older, maybe, yeah, that is like I am also trying to make a decision about this, you know, maybe I should do just no statics, just...
SPEAKER_00: dynamics, you know, no less than eight reps just to be super healthy and do the table time. And at the table, you know, maybe I should a little bit push my limits. But pushing with the weights, pushing at the table, you know, all the time. And then your joints don't handle this. Olabilirdi kardeşim. Evet, Kaan kardeşim.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I would like to see Devon, Devon. I would like to see Devon, my friend. I understand. But maybe, maybe he... Okay, about training, you're right. Michael didn't get injured while he's training.
SPEAKER_00: But again, you know, when you are aging, you can be careful about your activities as well. Maybe when you are young, you fall down, you would have better resistance. When you get old, then you may get injured more, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, a lot of messages passed. I just now went to the deep. Sorry for all those that I missed. Devon is now 261 pounds, I asked him today. And he said he can make 253 that easy. That's what he said, you know. But again, you know, there are some reasons.
SPEAKER_00: it's not exactly directly about Devon wanting to come and pull there's some other reasons and it is not my place so and i can i can explain but there is again you know 50 why georgia is great in armwrestling genetics the Caucasian reservation um the genetics do you know
SPEAKER_00: Paul Passmore, very strong side player, almost same, equal to Hutchings. I know, I heard about him, yeah. Dadikian, I don't think he's injured. Yeah, his right arm was injured before, but he was almost ready, you know, during the King of the Table time. And...
SPEAKER_00: after his left arm got injured we had to cancel his match with prudnik so i look for a right arm match for him and then i couldn't and then then he stopped training and everything he decided to rest for some time um nuke whisper can playman dimitrov pull someone from usa
SPEAKER_00: um thank you for your support i think clement dimitro and bulgarian federation there may be some conflict um i think pruning was iraqi would be a good man yeah timmy iraq is not ready iraq is not ready oleg petrenko versus pruning both are from ukraine and um
SPEAKER_00: Petrenko is already pulling jumpers in. No, my brother, no one called me. I don't know if they would call me. When Devon gets his match, he trains Pumpkin for six months. No, you guys have wrong opinion about him.
SPEAKER_00: wrong opinion about him. He, he, he is ready to come here. And trust me, he not only ready, he wants to come here. He wants to come here. That living Niles hint, my thoughts to you Engin are filled with your anger. As we try to be best for the world, we can do anything.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know what that means, but sorry for my English. Thank you for your support, my friend. If Devon Prudnik don't work out, Arif Prudnik would be a match. I don't know. Arif just get out of WAF.
SPEAKER_00: Guys, I already answered, you know, Daddy Kian, he's not going to pull. He's not ready. I already asked his manager. Daddy Kian, he said next summer he can pull.
SPEAKER_00: rob vision jr he's good for up to 100 kilo 115 kilo prudnik um anyways
SPEAKER_00: lrakli is not ready. He just started a week ago to train. He said he is going to get ready for January. Guys, you give me some names from around 100 kilo. 115 kilo Prudnik, even at 100 kilo.
SPEAKER_00: mean even at 100 kilo pruning was beating those guys that you guys mentioned at 115 kilo super prepared prudnik i mean we cannot replace him i mean replace michael with anybody just comes to a name to your mind you know it needs to be i'm telling you either either it needs to be someone like ongarwe
SPEAKER_00: and or Devon Larratt or in used to be a super heavyweight don't mention any name under 115 kilo Morozov is already pulling Revaz he cannot
SPEAKER_00: Denis Tsiplenko, guys, I'm telling you, many times I explained, I can't invite Russians, I'm sorry, it's not my decision. Yeah, Brunig is very, very hard to beat, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Corey West, I don't know about Corey. I invited Corey to November event. He couldn't come even when I invited months ago because of his work. So why would he, how could he come in last 25 days?
SPEAKER_00: Again, I will do my best. Murato is good with left arm. He's about like 92, 93 kilos. Less than 95 for sure. But left arm is good. But still for left arm, Prudnik 115 kilos. It wouldn't be a good one. No, Michael Todd will not be banned from anywhere. Michael Todd is a warrior. And he really wanted to pull. Devon, yes, yes. After I finish this live,
SPEAKER_00: I will try to set Devon Larratt with Prudnik. This is what I will try to do. Devon would want, for sure. But there are some reasons. He may not pull. Not because he would be scared. Not because he doesn't believe that he can win or something. But let's see how much Prudnik wants that much. Does Prudnik want...
SPEAKER_00: Sultan Otay. Thank you for your support.
SPEAKER_00: Alican Murado will be invited for January event. Kedirgali vs. Prudnik, yeah, anything is possible. I mean, under 115 kilo, if I would set someone against Prudnik, that person would be Kedirgali Ongarbev.
SPEAKER_00: Who says why no Bulgarians? Who is Bozhidar Simeonov? They will pull Adam Orzonski. Why you guys, I mean, say something without search? Matt Mask is going to pull Sandris Sedis, my friend, in the same event. Kurdecha, I even...
SPEAKER_00: was planning to set an event in December, Kurdesha said he made his mind up for January event, so I don't think he's going to take any match in 25 days. Corey West said he will be interested versus Brutnik, hmm, when did he say that? Because I invited him
SPEAKER_00: for November 19 event. He said he wasn't available, so we invited him to January. He never told me anything. Ömer Üstömer, the prodigy? Ömer Üstömer, our brother, Ömer Üstömer didn't win a medal in Europe or in the world. How can a prodigy do so much?
SPEAKER_00: How the Rebellions came to Devon? Oh, Timmy, yeah. Devon, I talked with him, you know. He's not afraid. Ferit is now resting after Chechnya event. He's also getting ready for January.
SPEAKER_00: The Dzeranov has a match. The Dzeranov is going to pull Sergey Kalinichenko. Did you ever call Samushia Andreev on East vs West? Probably 20 times. Chance show against you, my friend. Prudnik, you are saying chance show?
SPEAKER_00: I mean, ask Chance Shaw if he would accept to pull Prudnik. Come on, guys. I mean, Chance is great, of course, but we're talking about something, someone different level we are talking about. I mean, there is super elite guys and elite guys. Prudnik is in the super elite guys level. Yeah, they would accept to pull in a row.
SPEAKER_00: Farid is not. Kurdesha, they will be ready for. No, prime Engin, Prudnik wouldn't be a good match. Engin is a lightweight guy, natural lightweight guy. Prudnik is a heavyweight guy. Prudnik is incredible. I was good for my weight category, but I have never been 100 kilo. I mean, the biggest category that I competed heavy is at the WAF is 75 kilo.
SPEAKER_00: um if david arable be chance him versus brudnick maybe in the future you know we don't know yet but right now so is prudnik versus daddy can still on for his first fight no isaac it is daddy can prudnik match is cancelled about three weeks ago right after the king of the table when daddy can and morozov pull and daddy can get injured
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, as you said. Who is that? Andy. As Andy says, if anyone can pull it off, it's Devon. Yeah, I agree. Or he needs to pull with a super heavyweight. Maybe Gennady Kuvikvinia versus Prudnik. If Gennady is ready, he's posting some videos. Crazy lifting videos. Yeah. I'm not sure if Eric Spoto...
SPEAKER_00: He's there to beat Brutnik. Not experienced enough. This deal, 87. I'm excited to see Cobra Rose getting back in the mix. Very excited for his fight with Haydar Gildil. Going to be fun. Yes, both are legends. Oh, again I missed.
SPEAKER_00: Russell Tyrone Jones, Davit Dadikian versus Prudnik. Thank you for your super chat. My friend, Davit Dadikian will not be available till next summer. This is what his manager told me. He's taking a rest. No, my friend, I'm not going to make a poll. I'm not going to make a poll.
SPEAKER_00: If I make a poll, you see, there are a lot of, I would say, suggestions that, you know,
SPEAKER_00: Hello brother, good luck. I have Turkish viewers. If they don't know the rest, my brave brother, peace be upon you, may God be pleased with you. We are doing international business, brother. So we are doing international business that introduces Turkey to the world. I mean, I don't know who will understand if I tell Turkish, but I am sure I have benefited so much that no one in Turkey has given. There is no limit to the world champions I have raised.
SPEAKER_00: If someone is talking, they should do what I am doing, they should talk like that. They should not say nothing. I am ready. Devon or Corey, only options. Yeah, I agree. I agree. But think about it that John has defeated Corey. Do you think Evgeny cannot
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Sandris, I saw the waffles. I have some ideas. I saw where everyone is. Not a lot of big, big, big, big, huge surprises. But I had some ideas, of course. Gennady. Yeah, we can ask Gennady as well. But let's see. My first option will be rest versus Prudnik. No way.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, my friend. The guy that beat Bogoslav at Chechnya event, that guy is probably what, 90, 95 kilo category? We're talking about 115 to compare someone with Prudnik.
SPEAKER_00: Justin remember it needs to be someone like Laletin, Zaur, Ferid, Gennady, Revaz, Morozov. A good match for Prudnik can be super heavyweight. Or someone with a very dangerous style like Michael Todd or Devon Larratt.
SPEAKER_00: who can be very dangerous, even at Frutnik's category. Not many people. Either you need to find Ongarbaev, Michael Todd, Devon or Suprivate. The others are, no way. Still asking, Daddy Ken, you guys don't follow the church, right?
SPEAKER_00: No. Devon is ready to pull Prudnik. You believe or not. I talked with him and I saw his eyes. He wants to pull him. Trust me.
SPEAKER_00: I'm the last person that would say something positive about Devon if it is not true. You understand? He has a lot of, you know,
SPEAKER_00: like bravo bravo bravo bravo saying guys i'm not one of them but whenever he deserves something positive i'm i'm there i never hesitate to say that guy is very very good he he may be even number two in the world with a good preparation after the stem cell something happened to that guy i think his injuries are healed up and whoever is pulling against him even in training they are
SPEAKER_00: amazed and i with my own eyes saw some videos which i promised not to share the guy is strong so yeah yeah yeah ongar babe is very tall guy you know did i was planning for a comment i don't think so
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes, yes, yes. If he cannot make November, of course. I'm telling you. It's just Devon's first match with Evgeny Prudnik. My brother, Omer Usta Omer is our brother. He is the champion of Turkey. That's it.
SPEAKER_00: I know that. If no technical opponent, why not celebrity against strongman? I don't know if people would like to watch that. While they know that, you know, Evgeny would kill them. Let's give Morozov another chance. How, my friend, how? Like, Morozov in the same event as a match with Revaz, Lututze. How is he going to put Prudnik?
SPEAKER_00: Again, were you surprised Daniel Prokofiev got second? No, I'm not surprised. I knew that the category is very tough and the draw was going to play a huge factor. And Daniel and Minda was a very tough match, very tough match.
SPEAKER_00: If demon wants to pull, why is it 50%? I'm telling you, there are some reasons I can't share, you understand? But it is not my place, you understand? It's not my place. But the life is not all about arm wrestling. So, but if there is need, there needs to be some explanation, I'm not the person to do it. It is not like anything like a shame or something, you know, it is a good reason, but it is 50-50.
SPEAKER_00: it is up to like i know when you don't know what it is you are curious but it really makes sense you know um and do you think ongar web could still retain his speed at 110 yes he's a tall guy and see these guys are pulling my legs he's still saying what about morozov when they know that he has a match with dravas you know um
SPEAKER_00: No, I wouldn't take it. Russians, I mean, I would like to have Russians in my event, but WAF doesn't allow, the World Armwrestling Federation, because of the Olympic Committee. But even if they can come, I'm not going to set them against Ukrainians. There is no need such thing, you know. It is, someone needs to be very bad person to do that. Okay, Neil Pickup, supernatural strength official.
SPEAKER_00: Hello Neil. Flying visit Engin. Justin heading to meeting and heard about my pulling out injured. Really sorry to hear. But considering the form, Ongar Bey was just in the walk, didn't pull with right arm. Yes, I agree with you. But let's see. I will try to do Devon.
SPEAKER_00: Why not run with that as a replacement just much? No, I'm telling you, that is one of the names that I mentioned, you know, around his weight category, only on Garber and Devon. Other than that, he needs to be a super heavyweight.
SPEAKER_00: my friend you don't know why it is 50% you don't get it because you don't know everything and I'm telling you it's not my place to tell everything here but sometimes you may have some reasons maybe your best friends best best ever friends wedding on the same exact date I mean it is not but maybe you understand
SPEAKER_00: Maybe you promised him that, you know, you promised him 20 years ago that you said, I will be your best man, you know, on that, you know, day, you know, you don't know that. So, but it is not like that. It is not, there is nothing like that. But in life, there are other things. I'm just trying to open perspective, you know. So the match on dependent on Prudnik wants the match or not? No, it's not that simple.
SPEAKER_00: I'm leaving now's hands. Get the declaration in your brotherhood. I don't know what that means. I will check it after the congestant. I don't know what it means. Oh, okay, okay. Now I know what it is. Thank you. Thank you for the suggestion.
SPEAKER_00: I remember that Tim Breslin was set to put him in top eight, but he got COVID so much. No way Devon is number two, not even if there would be two arm wrestlers on the earth. Gennady is too much for Prudnik. Gennady who crashed Dave's side pressure. I am not sure about that.
SPEAKER_00: Get and Devon could be heavy on your pocket, Engin. Yes, yes. But, but, talking with Engin Terzi, so if possible, he could do it for you fans. You think that Engin's priority is his pocket? But if I said that match, I want you guys to support.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, got the round, but think about Garbev option. He didn't pull up, right? Yes, that makes sense, Neil. Thank you. Let me go to the bottom of the chat.
SPEAKER_00: Engin, I posted a little super chat. God bless, brother. Hope to see you. Oh, where did you post the super chat, my friend? I'm sorry. Proving astrology. Thank you for putting up with chat, Engin. We appreciate the update and the transparency.

Hope you solidify a good replacement for Michael. Thank you for your support, my friend. I will do my best. Trust me.
SPEAKER_00: what i do you guys know already once a match is cancelled before you guys hear i come back with a replacement
SPEAKER_00: but since michael made that announcement so i didn't have possibility to do that but as soon as michael said he cannot pull trust me i'm just trying to do all kind of you know connections but since you guys here heard about it already so i had to do this live and explain
SPEAKER_00: what's going on but normally when I hear a match is canceled because of injury I don't tell you guys I just go do my best to find a replacement as good as the previous one and then then inform you guys together with the cancellation and the replacement now I'm also trying to do my best but just remember it is not that easy
SPEAKER_00: 25 days before the event and you are talking about someone who is almost untouchable at his weight. So it's not that easy. You understand? I'm doing my best my friends. I'm doing my best. Adam Johanson, looking to have accepted my challenge versus him.
SPEAKER_00: Would you do the honor of hosting us in East versus West? Thank you for your support, my friend. My friend, I don't really organize the events when people say that, you know, we are great, you know, set us, you know. I really choose...
SPEAKER_00: the pullers, you know, that I invite, trust me, I can say hundreds of people are asking, you know, to have a match at East versus West. And I'm not going to give the name, but even a world medalist and current medalist is asking, ask, you know, to set a match by even paying money to me. And I said, sorry, you know, I can't do this. I cannot do this.
SPEAKER_00: But thank you for your super chat. But I will consider. But I cannot promise you. Rambet versus Prudence. No, my friend. It is not about injury, Devon.
SPEAKER_00: There are some more important things in this life. Does Evgeny want Devon or someone else? Or he doesn't care? Evgeny is an interesting guy. Evgeny gave me two names.
SPEAKER_00: little wheels and something and i said are you joking and and he probably was joking i said no how about how about i said levan saginashvili he said oh okay but i said okay but he said okay about fifty thousand dollars win or lose i said no no no i give you a hundred thousand dollars and then fifty thousand dollars for winning bonus you know and he said ah yeah okay that's good you know that that um
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Devon would be great, as you guys say. Yeah, Prudnik, I mean, the guy is interesting, you know. We need to admit that Prudnik is a very interesting person.
SPEAKER_00: You saw his video that he made for Michael Toast. I was like, wow, this guy is just seriously next level. You know, he breaks everything. And then he goes like, hey, Michael. I was like, wow. Like I grew up in 90s and late 80s, 90s, my young years. I remember those horror movies, you know.
SPEAKER_00: And then like a psychopath, he breaks the wall, everything. He says, oh, I'm sorry, Michael. I'm sorry. What did I do? You know, please help me or something. I was like, wow, this guy is really interesting guy. You know, I don't even know how he got that idea to make that video, you know, just that.
SPEAKER_00: lrakli is not injured. lrakli, he just starts training. Justin remember, guys, these guys have a career, a reputation, and they have dreams. They are not going to take a serious match without being 100% ready. It is not like, you know, they...
SPEAKER_00: they want to be at their best because if they lose nobody is going to give them the second chance against the same guy so they want to perform so these guys are i don't know how to say don't expect them to pull very very very very serious match without being 100 ready
SPEAKER_00: I don't think the Dennis Japan. When will you know if Devon is in or? Very soon, probably
SPEAKER_00: Next 48 hours, we will know everything. We will know everything. Both guys are ready to pull. Both guys are ready to pull. They are very strong. And I can't even imagine what the social media do if this match is set because Devon has been holding, you know, everything.
SPEAKER_00: back he's waiting he was waiting for his time for january to start firing you know to prudnik and we know that prudnik also can do incredible things on social media and wow i mean i don't know i would probably go over the stage and watch like that close you know if that match happens
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think that I should already go and do my best to set. Devon is already ready. Devon is really strong right now. Devon could, no, see, if Devon pull, doesn't pull, you guys say he's scared. If Devon pulls, then you guys are saying he wants money. Come on, my friend, just, I mean, let's be a little bit easy on this guy, you know, I mean.
SPEAKER_00: I am I don't know the guy is ready and he can pull you understand it's not about money it is of course it's about money but it's not all about the money and he just wants to be healthy and he is healthy now he is ready he can pull we need a little bit time probably maximum four days hours maybe even less then we will find out you know if this guy can pull here or not
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes, yes, yes, Devon is ready. Devon is ready. Devon is ready for a 253 match. And probably if you give him two, three months, he can be ready for any guy for number two spot in the world. I don't hold back, Engin, my heartfelt dollars to you.
SPEAKER_00: my part 12 dollars to you my friend i don't know what it means but thank you living nails hints thank you my friend for your support um there is there cannot be an arm wrestling chat without bone you cannot stop right now hanging your time is better spent around your match no i'm not gonna stop i'm very ill seriously whenever i i'm coughing my lungs are going
SPEAKER_00: Okay, sorry, a phone call came. A phone call came. Yeah, Zaur is a very dangerous guy. Devon versus Zaur. Maybe it proved it. Avoid the bio-jet engine at any cost. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know but Devon Devon said that you know he's ready Devon Devon I was like thinking that Devon is playing something sometimes but more I spend time with him you know like private talking I realized that the guy is crazy the guy is not normal either you know he likes to take risk that's what I see and
SPEAKER_00: And... No, it wasn't Devon. It wasn't Devon. You guys are funny. Yep, Engin has the guns, yeah. See? But Engin hasn't been training. I really don't know. I just had stem cell. I don't know how much effect it gave me. Kaan Yener, Allah razı olsun kardeşim.
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, guys, so, I don't know. Very soon, very soon. Engin versus Devon 2000. I don't think Devon will go 100 kilo, and I don't think that Devon is the Devon that, you know, I thought I could, you know, do something. The latest Devon that I saw is very dangerous, and it would be criminal to ask him even to go...
SPEAKER_00: go down to that when he is feeling now healthy. I will tell you something, if Devon would challenge Lewand now, community wouldn't take him seriously.
SPEAKER_00: But if Devon comes and cleans around for number two spot, then he will automatically get that second shot to Levan.
SPEAKER_00: Ermes versus Dave is 50-50 match. But I also talk with Ermes. And Ermes says that he's feeling incredible.
SPEAKER_00: today this tonight i was talking with hermes and i was i was teasing him and not really teasing him in fact i was also telling i said hermes i mean if you would ask me about a month ago how would you do against devon i would just say that you would just probably crush him but after what i started to see with devon and i started to have my doubts and he was like oh
SPEAKER_00: You know, you're not serious. And because he believes he can beat Devon. And I said, no, my friend, he has, there is a possibility he can beat you as well, you know. And he says his wrist is very strong and he doesn't think that, and I said, but Devon's pronator is also very strong too. But he's so sure of himself, you know. But of course, he respects me so much to hear this from me.
SPEAKER_00: also makes him think a little bit and yeah yeah yeah like yeah as you said like yeah
SPEAKER_00: oh i love these guys you know more more more these guys from the east like prudnik hermes more they started to um how to say express their thoughts their feelings in english and more people start to get to know them everything started to become so colorful you know that i mean those
SPEAKER_00: challenges before the matches and everything it's all super dominant personalities even they look calm in fact in in inside of them they are very very dominant personalities um demo no dino celsic celsic and in house from do you think
SPEAKER_00: dennis is right now do you think he's already top 10 cheers get well soon thank you my friend thank you for your support uh yes i think i think i think um i am not sure if dennis is top five but i think he is in top ten um yeah but i do not know how far he can go
SPEAKER_00: Do I think that he can go as far as beating Levan? In my opinion, no disrespect to Denis, I don't believe so. I am not sure if even the best of Denis could do much to Levan. I think in my opinion Levan is the strongest ever.
SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, that is a great comment. Yeah, who says that 44% stronger? If Devon versus Prudnik happens, the setup would take a full hour. Do you guys think that I should ref that match? Imagine Prudnik and Devon pulling and I'm reffing the match.
SPEAKER_00: Valla kardeşim, önce bir hazır olayım, ondan sonra düşünürüm. Yeah, Engin absolutely getting there. Crafty match would be incredible. Imagine the face of Larratt, you can make pay-per-view only from this. I'm not care about pay-per-view but I really would like to be
SPEAKER_00: There, you know, part of it. By the way, I'm a senior level WAF referee. Stelso, treatment, I don't know, my friend. Hello, Chance. Hello, Chance. Chance, please write there.
SPEAKER_00: Do you want me to set you with Prudnik? Because people suggest, I think that you are not ready for Prudnik. But if you are thinking that you are ready, just let me know. Engin will don't host the event again. He will do the announcement, yeah. No, no, no, no. Devon will probably pull in also in January as well.
SPEAKER_00: Chance would accept that match. Angry versus Larry was to kick off the matches. Anyway, did Chance answer? I missed it or what? Ermes versus Morozov, what do you think? They will put left arm. It's going to be a good match. I don't think it's going to be easy match. Why am I always angry? I'm not angry right now. People, you know, who... I mean, I have reasons, but it is not...
SPEAKER_00: all about me if you would like to set a match to keep britney on winning record i would happily accept okay guys you read by your own self you know so yeah i mean it is there is no shame you know being underdog to britney you know we all know chance so no disrespect man i mean there are a handful people on this earth that has chance to beat this guy we all know um
SPEAKER_00: Is it true that Matyushenko beat Zaur recently? Left arm, yes. Zaur's left arm is not that strong. Honestly, chance is a chance. How do you see chance beating Prudnik, my friend? Top roll him or hook on him? How do you think they would beat him? Yeah, injury, yes. Kadir would get injured, yes. Brian Lee, thank you for super chat. Any chance Samushia pulls Ali Can instead of Oleg?
SPEAKER_00: in fact that's the match that i was thinking and maybe target active with oleg um thank you for your support uh travis badger ruffin um no i didn't think about it um if devon says no you will ask dennis dennis dennis is not gonna pull him also dennis is from russia
SPEAKER_00: World Armistice Federation doesn't allow me to have Russian athletes. I see my chance less than 10% in a top role and 1% in hook chances. Devon, who is...
SPEAKER_00: Number to back up to Devon. Who is number to back up to Devon in your opinion? I don't know. I already invited Yarda. Let me pull with Yusuf. Last East versus West. I may invite again. Who is that guy? MT82. Thank you for your support, my friend. Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, that's what I said, brother. And what do you guys think that, you know, Prudnik would film and release video if he pulls Devon? Um, WAF event right now, I don't want to talk about it right now. I'm focused on East versus West, my friend, and and
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, guys, so let me go back to work and try to set you guys Devon Larratt versus Evgeny Prudnik match. Mr. Smith, Dimitri Vizel versus Prudnik. Thank you for your super chat. I think Prudnik is heavily favored there.
SPEAKER_00: MT82, hope you feel 100% and you can wait for the 19. Thank you. Thank you, my friend. Thank you for your support. Why can King of the Table? King of the Table is not a WAF member, my friends. My event is Turkish Armwrestling Federation sanctioned. I mean, the permission you get from there.
SPEAKER_00: If I invite international band athletes to my event, and then, like, I'm not going to get permission. Do I favor Prudnik against Larratt? Honestly, no. If you asked this question a month ago, I would say yes. Now I say no.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, Welsh. Thank you, my friend. Thank you for your fine work. May you be well. Thank you. I don't know what my brother is thinking. Maybe he thinks, I created the small mountains, the big ones are inherited from my father.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you Engin, we believe in your power. Do you think Engin, do you think Engin get Devon to agree? We know you will. Ah, it is not up to me. Engin, you said Devon is 260, yes, he's 261 pounds, yeah. It's what he told me today. Um...
SPEAKER_00: Living Niles Hintz. I'm out of here. Thank you, Engin. Remember to reset the immune system for arthritic conditions or others. Okay, my friend. I will check that. Thank you for your super chats and support. Thank you, my friend. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Engin, will you ever participate in a super match at the East vs West after stem cell heal? Yeah. Yeah, that's the plan. I want to get ready. I miss armwrestling. I miss armwrestling. I have so much pain on neck, back, arms and everywhere. And I want to get ready and I want to...
SPEAKER_00: I want to pull again. I don't want to be only organizer. I mean, organizer is fine. Being organizer is great. But I know that if I don't pull anytime soon, I won't be able to pull in the future. So, I mean, so while I still can, I hope, then I better pull. Thank you, guys.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, I will do, I will do live. Oh, there will be heat. Do you guys, do you guys, okay, just say yes or no. Do you guys want to see Devon Larratt and Evgeny Prudnik? Yes or no? Oh yeah, oh yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_00: but only 15 years 16 probably okay out of 454 there is what 18 20 um okay about 40 people wants to see that match and 410 doesn't want
SPEAKER_00: probably 70 there is no other match there is no better match because this is for heavyweight number one spot any match for super heavyweight will not be for the number one spot but this match for 115 kilo will be number one spot in the world you know
SPEAKER_00: Yes, my friend, yes. So, now after I see this probably already 200, yes, I think I will work even harder. Yes, same weight, 250, 315 kilo. Yeah, I will try, I will try. If I do, I do.
