SPEAKER_01: hello joe hello devon's forearm hello victor clark 93 nodo bob sorry about it i don't know how to pronounce antonio royals hello hello how are you guys doing um
SPEAKER_01: anyone here um like if there is anyone some some channels you know when they take uh the interview parts they don't put the link to the interview but they just take the part uh please please don't do that um if you are taking some interview parts you know just make sure that you put also the link to full interview hello
SPEAKER_01: Antonio, do you believe Devon is number two? I mean, Devon right now, when he is light, 260 pounds, may not be number two. But Devon that Levan pulled in Dubai, I'm not going to argue with Levan. I'm not going to say he's wrong. But I think that some, you know, there needs to be matches. This is his opinion. We don't need to really...
SPEAKER_01: argue with Levan. This is his opinion. If every fan has an opinion, then Levan, let him have his own opinion as well. I mean, I'm sure that his opinion is not any lighter than, you know, any of us. So thank you, Devon Sparrow. Thank you. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: also about the the videos uh from the east versus west when they are fresh for at least for one month don't please post i'm talking to generally uh anywhere you know i mean um if you don't want copyright strike after one month you can use in a clip but not more than one round for each match not if you show the full match rounds you know if the match is four rounds you show all of them and there is a problem starts you know
SPEAKER_01: place because I'm really risking myself. Beginner arm masters should pull in their own country.
SPEAKER_01: and get better themselves. East versus West is not a platform for them. At least not anymore. Can I get and ask Dennis if we can go down to 115 kilos? I'm not sure if Dennis is going to pull anywhere before February.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, the biggest advice, I mean, right now I'm not here for the advice for the beginners, but I can, the best thing I can say that if you are a beginner, it means that you need to record, record, record, you know, the muscle memory. So I would suggest them to pull as much as possible.
SPEAKER_01: anyway so is there anyone who still wants to see can Devon sign t-shirts to be the most complete legends t-shirt but I mean if Devon would come he would sign he will have to sign GB19 but is he coming it doesn't look like
SPEAKER_01: But who knows? It's Devon. Whenever Devon wants to do something, the guy, for a reason, has a nickname called No Limits. The guy is really a different breed. Yeah, we can ask when he comes. Hello, Bobby Ray.
SPEAKER_01: My friend, I'm on YouTube. Often when the East versus West is coming close, I do interview with the athletes and I do interview with the famous athletes, even if they don't compete at East versus West, like Devon and Devon, you know. So normally I'm not that often on YouTube.
SPEAKER_01: But when the time is coming close, of course, I need to promote the events. How is mission saving private Devon going? Private Devon, that mission, how is it going? Who knows? Who knows? You know, some
SPEAKER_01: very very important missions when they are happening you don't talk about them right yeah do you we will ask them everyone's nickname is no limits thank you bobby bobby ray
SPEAKER_01: All strength. Engin, you are the man. Thank you, my friends. Thank you. Devon's firm. I am safe now, friends. Private Laret. Use the open operating now. If Devon can't, we will see. Here it is. Engin is in Canada right now, not in Turkey. Yes. How did you know that? I'm in Ottawa now.
SPEAKER_01: Somebody just came. Who is it? It's Roman. Hello, Engin. Hello, my friend. You look sideways. Yeah, I will try to fix this as soon as possible. Thank you. Hello. Avqat Yasir Ferit Akkaya. Salaam alaikum. Salaam, karde≈üim. Bobby Ray Paris. What age do you think people are staying for arm wrestling?
SPEAKER_01: I said yesterday, probably if you are healthy between 25 and 40, Levan will have a match in February, most likely in Dubai. Who do you think is the best opponent for Levan in February? We will find out soon. East versus West 5. Vasily, how do you feel? Vasily just broke his arm. Second time. He wanted to be part of it.
SPEAKER_03: uh i wish you speedy recovery my friend i'm very sorry that happened during competition or training or what no competition competition amateur competition uh after uh one day it was a qot series yes and on the next day i matter in the final okay
SPEAKER_01: How do I feel after the stem cell treatment? I mean, I'm not sure. Yesterday I went and trained. I felt the elbows. I mean, not bad. The fingers still have pressure and pain here, but I don't know if it is like still it's getting better for sure. But the lateral epicondylate didn't feel good. I mean, let's see. Time will show. Maybe I needed to be active and send some blood there, you know, circulation.
SPEAKER_01: Let's see if we will see. I just started yesterday. What did I do? Like only 35 kilo bench press and only 15 kilo cable cross and which we call butterfly. I did with like what 50 kilo or something. Very light training, very light training. And I did some with handle some risker and those are the only things that I did. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: okay here is the man here is the terminator hello uh angie can you see me is my uh video video no i don't see i see darkness and i also see morozov very dark he wants to oh whoa one moment i'm driving you're driving yeah what are you driving bicycle
SPEAKER_01: no no car are you in the car now oh okay okay i thought you were outside uh sub to be yeah maybe maybe they may be less effective yeah i don't know we will see
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he's singing one of the national Ukrainian songs. Oh, okay. Tell him to stick with arm wrestling. He's better at it than singing. Tell him I'm just joking, teasing him.
SPEAKER_03: No, he's just kidding. He's just teasing you. No, of course it's normal. I'm better at armwrestling than in everything, even in sex. He's in armwrestling way more better than any other thing, even better than sex. I mean, we are not interested about that one. Not with you, not with you.
SPEAKER_01: um okay what do i think it was interesting match but bojidar just pulled six days ago at waff and before yesterday's event i think it was too early for him to compete engine when you come back to competition what weight class routine 85 kilo and let's focus now to the guest please and hey listen we have some very nice t-shirts that
SPEAKER_01: Artem Morozov will also sign. And where is Artem Morozov? Artem is again in darkness. Artem will sign too, right, Artem?
SPEAKER_03: I go home. No signature, no money. He's almost home. He's home, so just maybe a couple of minutes. Justin give him, please, one, two minutes. He's almost at home.
SPEAKER_01: need to get home and uh took the earphones yeah roman give us a favor can you put something still behind you instead of moving yeah yeah that's better yeah but you it looks opposite way to you okay i will mirror it yeah yeah so so we are waiting now loot is
SPEAKER_01: Did you send Morozov to save private Larratt? Looks like he's on this close location. Yes, yes, yes. What do you think? Yeah, we are trying to save Devon. You guys know, right? Did you guys watch? Yeah, we need to save him because he blinked his eyes three times like this and it means that he's hostage. Yeah, he's being held hostage.
SPEAKER_01: Now we sent Morozov to Canada. He's in Ottawa now for a special mission. And he's going to save Devon, but he's not going to take the purse. He's only going to bring Devon. He's going to send you to a special mission in Ottawa, Canada, so you can save Devon. So he doesn't get hurt again. What do we need to save him from?
SPEAKER_01: From what exactly he need to be help one like from what exactly he need to be Devon has been okay Jody Larratt doesn't allow Devon to compete and Prudnik asked Jody not Devon he said are you being held hostage? Ah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I got it I got it show some signs
SPEAKER_01: He said that if you are being held hostage, then blink your eyes. And then Devon put the video on the social media. He blinked his eyes. It means that he needs to be saved. So we are going to save him. But I said we are going to save him. I, Prudnik and Ermes. But this is like we are just trying to trick them. So we say that way. But in fact, Arthur Morozov now is in Canada.
SPEAKER_03: that is on our mission is going to save Devon and bring back to Istanbul for East vs. West, right? Yeah, okay, I'm going to translate now. In short, Larratt's wife doesn't allow him to compete. And Prudnik whispers to him, like, blink a couple of times if you're held hostage.
SPEAKER_03: And he released a video of Larratt and blinked three times. And on the air with RMS, Engin said that they would save him. But this is a distracting maneuver. And in fact, they sent you and you are now on a special mission in Canada, in the province of Attawa, to save Devon and bring him back to Turkey for the East vs West competition. But Engin, it's a secret, it's a secret. It was impossible to say, it was impossible to reveal everything.
SPEAKER_01: hanging why you said this come on we make an agreement i forgot we are on live i forgot sorry sorry we are on live under 35 people are watching sorry about it i'm getting old old old that's why hey guys on the chat don't get offended i and devin and everyone joking nobody is really i mean um
SPEAKER_01: meaning what we say. You understand? We are just teasing each other. So no need to be... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so before... I don't know where... It's 10 minutes past. Where is Ravas? I saw him joining, but video glitched or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Same as me. You see it now. Oh, you see here? Yeah, I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, can you turn your screen sideways? Yeah. No, this is the way, yeah. Sideway, but OK. I think it's horizontal.
SPEAKER_01: told him that we also cannot hear him so richard richard i don't mean that i don't mean that i know you are joking but what i mean by saying joking we don't have ill intention we are not really uh disrespecting or something this is what i try to say of course you know that i'm joking right now oh yes yes look on his iphone he is uh turn off the volume yes yes i see i see i will tell you
SPEAKER_01: I mean, why do I have so many translators? Because I have a Russian speaking athletes and Georgii speaking athletes. For Russian, I need one translator. For Georgii, I have another translator because Russian and Georgii are different languages.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so you need to turn the microphone. Message him, message him. I told him, I told him. Okay. Still, you see, maybe message better. I will message him. Yeah, he's going to message. You hear us? Uh-uh. Still.
SPEAKER_01: Still, you need to... I sent the message. You have his number. Let's start with Morozov already. Morozov, yesterday, I had a guest, the number one guy in the world and probably stronger ever armwrestler yesterday. Levan Saginashvili was here. And I asked him about what he thinks, you versus Revaz. And he said,
SPEAKER_03: Revaz is going to beat you as easy as he beat Derek Smith. What do you think about this? Do you have an answer for that? Yesterday, Engin had a guest on the podcast, he was number one in the world ranking in armwrestling. And he asked him, how will your fight against Levan Lutidze go? And he said that
SPEAKER_03: No, I understand him perfectly, because they train together. I would do the same for my guys. But here we will just fight and see how it goes. I can't say that I will win, but I don't want to lose. I will be ready to fight 100%.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that he understands him as well, Levan, I mean, because they are training together. For his own homie, he would also say something like this. He would kill as well for his own homie, yes, for his own gym buddy. But he says that he's not saying that he's going to win-win, but he will do his best on 100% and the table will show. I understand.
SPEAKER_01: like he's gonna do his best and but like honestly how does he see his chances like like does he see himself favorite of this match or is he playing underdog?
SPEAKER_03: Do you want a serious answer or get hyped? First tell the hype one. 120% that he's going to beat him. This is not a serious one. What's the serious one?
SPEAKER_03: Now it's serious. Now it's serious? 50-50, I think. If seriously, 50-50. I understand. Because how can you say when you've never even fought a person? Because how you can be sure on real 100% if you never pull him, if you never saw him.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but he kind of was sure of himself in previous match against Derek in May, was he not? Can you again repeat? At the beginning was a bit... He was kind of sure of himself when he was pulling against Derek Smith. Was he not sure of himself? Because he never pulled Derek either, but...
SPEAKER_03: Let's talk about your fight with Derek Smith. You said you weren't 100% confident and fought him easily. Were you also not confident? Of course I wasn't. I got scared when I saw him. I had to change my pants.
SPEAKER_03: Same, same. Yeah, it's true. Before his match with Derek Smith, he also wasn't sure that he was going to win. And when he saw him live, he went out to change his pants. See, whenever he says these last words at the end, it is hard to take what he says previously, you know, also seriously. You know what I mean?
SPEAKER_03: Yesterday, I had Devon Saginashvili as my guest.
SPEAKER_01: And he said, you're going to beat Morozov as easy as you beat Derek Smith. And now, um, I asked this to Morozov and Morozov said that Levan says this because you are friends from same country, training partners, and he doesn't think that this can happen. You know, at least this is what I understood.
SPEAKER_04: And you want his opinion about this, right? Yeah, you can translate what Levan said, what Morozov said.
SPEAKER_04: that if you want to be able to do something, you need to know how to do it. What does it mean to be able to do something? And I think all of this is very important. And I think that if you don't want to be able to do something, you need to know how to do it. And I think all of this is very important. I think all of this is very important. And I think all of this is very important.
SPEAKER_04: He understands completely.
SPEAKER_04: He has not seen so far what exactly Levan has said, but what you just said, Engin, and what Artem also had the reaction about this, he completely understands and he's neutral about this. He doesn't have any specific some sort of idea about this, just normal.
SPEAKER_04: And Revos just said that he likes the way how confident Levan was when he said something like that about him. And about Morozov, also he thinks
SPEAKER_04: Compared to Derek, he must say that Morozov is another level, stronger one. And Morozov is definitely not the one who should be treated lightly. He's a threat and he is definitely a bigger opponent this time. His opponent is stronger and bigger this time than it was... Can I translate this? Yes, please, yes.
SPEAKER_03: He understands what Levan said. He didn't hear it, but he understands why he said that. But there are two things. First, he liked what Levan said, that's for sure. But secondly, he said that you are, in any sense, higher than Derek Smith, and you still need to treat him more seriously.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I'm also very serious about it, so it's hard for me to say that I'll win 100%. Since we communicate well, even though we don't understand each other, but I see that he's a good person, so I say 50-50. I respect him very much. He respects him so much, yes. And that's why he cannot be sure 100%. He cannot be sure 100%.
SPEAKER_04: who's gonna be the winner, even despite of language barrier, that they cannot talk properly with each other, but he still understand him and respect, nothing rather than respect to him. I will briefly also tell this to Revaz.
SPEAKER_04: . It's like vice versa, and thanks to you, Morozov. Thank you, Morozov. I got it. Yeah, and first time when I invited Revaz,
SPEAKER_01: It was after four years, he had only two months to prepare and he said he is 40%. Second time I invited him, he said he is 60%. And I said, third time, what are you going to be? Last time I said, and he said, he's going to be 80%. Can you ask him where is he at now?
SPEAKER_04: Okay, no problem. He approves. He approves that he's at 80% now.
SPEAKER_03: Ah, and if...
SPEAKER_04: So, and if he's successful and after he's successful against his opponent, which we have on the other corner right now, then he's sure that he will progress even higher than 80%. And then also said, first of all, he said, if he beats Morozov, but then said that, but well, if Lewandowski said that I'm going to win, that most likely I'm going to win. So yeah, then he promises us to be higher than 80% next time.
SPEAKER_03: This time, he's going to be only 80%. He promises, so there is nothing to be scared for Morozov. Okay, you can translate for us. In short, when Engin first invited him, Rivas said he was ready for 20%, then for 40%, then for 60%, and now he said he was ready for 80%. He will try to show himself better for all 100% next time.
SPEAKER_03: And Engin said that if it's 80%, then Tyoma doesn't have to be afraid.
SPEAKER_03: Well, you still have to be afraid, because the strength of armwrestling, in fact, does not always decide. I look at Revaz, he is big, tall, he has very good anthropometry, he is a very good top. It will be difficult for me with him, for example. But it may be that it will be convenient for me, on the contrary.
SPEAKER_03: So, shortly, he's going to do his best. And despite that you mentioned, and Rivas as well, that he's ready approximately on 80%,
SPEAKER_03: Maybe this 80% will be enough for him with Artem. Or maybe for Artem will be more comfortable. He is not sure because Rivas has a quite good anthropometry. He's small, he's big. So power, it's not only one thing on which you need to be orientated in armwrestling. You need to be aware as well. I will translate to Rivas. Who is talking?
SPEAKER_04: Oh, it's him and Zaur. Zaur is here? Yeah, Zaur is here. He said hello. Good to see you. Good to see you.
SPEAKER_01: sweden 1994. he said he's the one with this deep voice you know tell roman tell him that that year the georgian team yes was the
SPEAKER_01: Because this year, Kazakhs were very dominant, but there was no Georgii, no Russia. I mean, I don't take anything away from Kazakhstan. They were incredible, but there was no Russia, no Georgii. I'm sure if Russia and Georgii was there, there would be some medals would be going to these countries as well. But 1994, in 1994, WAF in Sweden, it was the most successful
SPEAKER_01: love team in the world the georgian team in the men uh can he can you ask him if he remembers how many goals they got there how many gold medals right yeah yeah i mean yeah
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I remember, um, hundred kill, I mean, super heavyweights.
SPEAKER_01: And I remember Jimmy Maravishvili, 80 kilos. And then 70 kilos Vekvia Sankaradze.
SPEAKER_01: Unfortunately, Kudgerashvili has passed away. Unfortunately, he's passed away. This last name... Kudgerashvili died? Passed away? Yeah, he's passed away.
SPEAKER_01: 55 kilos, I won. 75 kilos, Andreas Rundstr√∂m won. Wow, that Georgii team was incredible. I mean, that year, incredible they were.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, that's right. We were the ones who came up with the idea. I, Gennady, Levani came up with the idea. When did you start? In 2005 or 2006.
SPEAKER_04: he also mentioned that lately like newer generation like himself canadi lately it was like time when he was competing he was competing uh under 110 kg it was 2015 and he mentioned that like one two years they also were dominant yeah i mean but they were dominant but that year the walls the georgian team like such a record has never been yeah
SPEAKER_01: And there is a question, another thing, is Zaur ready for Sharon? Zaur is ready for Sharon. Zaur is ready for Sharon.
SPEAKER_04: He's still under the pain, but he's going to pull if it's that long. He's getting old. He's 60 years old, so he's not a small boy. He's probably 58 or something. Yeah, Zaur also said that they are the same age, roughly.
SPEAKER_01: And can you ask him, Sharon told me that he and Zaur won one. He said that in 97 Golden Arm, Zaur beat him in Sweden. And in 1991 WAF, after the event, they bet money against each other and Sharon beat Zaur. So one time Zaur won, one time Sharon won. Can you ask Zaur?
SPEAKER_00: Zau, let's continue with you. It is clear that the two of you were in the same place, one in Tmog and the other in the same place, in 1991 and in 1997. I did not expect Sharon to come to me. And Sharon is my friend, Sharon will come to me in Tama to talk to me, and I will tell her that Sajjad and I
SPEAKER_00: I worked with Gliwdy. I worked with Gliwdy for a long time. And now I'm working on other things. I'm still working on some operations. I'm still working on some operations. I'm still working on some operations. I'm still working on some operations. I'm still working on some operations. I'm still working on some operations. I'm still working on some operations.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Okay. So he doesn't recall exactly if Sharon has ever pinned him, like has a W against him. He said that he won. And after he beat Sharon, then Sharon practically retired. And then he was like, he also mentioned against Cliff Dean versus Cliff Dean. Sharon was referee on that match.
SPEAKER_04: yeah he also said that and lately sharon had like uh surgery uh has done with uh with he had some a jaw cancer or something here and his surgery has done and yeah this is a little news yeah but he's in good shape yeah he said that he will be ready
SPEAKER_00: I was born in Gere, in the village of Amadgil, in Marilevichan, and now I'm born in Bolotro, in Khariv, in Kurnale, but I live there. I live in a small pool in the village, but I don't have anything to do with it. I don't have anything to do with it. I don't have anything to do with it. I don't have anything to do with it.
SPEAKER_04: So he mentioned that in his case he also has had the pain here in elbow and also lately it started also in shoulder. So he's quite in pain and he has a swimming pool at his home and he's doing this regularly but still the pain is there and he doesn't feel quite comfortable because of this pain.
SPEAKER_00: There is a lot of work in the field, because there is a lot of work in the field, and there is a lot of work in the field, and there is a lot of work in the field,
SPEAKER_04: uh he has not injured this while arm wrestling or anything like that he injured this uh during sleeping because he sleeps uh pearly on his right side and because of his weight uh like in time it's uh graduated to this uh like pain that he has and since he retired he has not actually armrestled or something like this so it's quite
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah we we should wish him the uh best and then i got it i got it oh i was listening i said to artoma briefly two words that you just remember when you were when you were young yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah did you tell him
SPEAKER_01: wrote him yeah tell him that uh that uh don't worry they're just uh remembering the age when they were the time when they were young this guy has wins against cleve dean even even i remember i think one time against john brzing he's just one of the you know what super heavyweight champion from the past anyways there is a super yeah you can translate yeah
SPEAKER_03: Yes, he recognized him. Yeah, he is only two meters, you know. I know.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean uh we need to remember our legends from the past we cannot be ungrateful you understand that is why i do legend category now cobra is coming
SPEAKER_01: zaur will come sharon will come in the future maybe ellen fisher some other legends we are going to invite anyways there is a super chat top role is for smart this guy is asking morozov prudnik rematch morozov was injured last time during the match what he thinks does he think that maybe in the future a rematch he wants uh
SPEAKER_03: You were injured in your last match against Prudnik. Do you want a rematch with Prudnik? I would like a rematch, of course, but not in the near future. Because now I have a very strong injury on my left hand after Davidov to Dityan. I didn't want to fight before that, but I had to. I'll fight now.
SPEAKER_03: I want to take a break and practice for six months. And then we can talk about the rematch with Prudnik. Not earlier than in the middle of the spring. Evgeny later. Not earlier than in the summer.
SPEAKER_03: So he thinks that for sure he would like to have another match with Sprunding, but not now because he's still in a huge pain in his left arm. He got it injured. With the right hand as well also, but less than left. And after his next matches, yeah, he want to take a break, recover, getting ready and approximately
SPEAKER_01: Only starting from summer, he can compete. He better, he better. He pulled East vs West 2, East vs West 3, East vs West 4, East vs West 5, and also pulled the King of the Table. In this year, he completed five events, and in the East vs West, he completed four events with right and left, Bravo and Leva. And so he is pulling a lot.
SPEAKER_03: He needs to be rescued. This guy really needs to be rescued. Yeah, yeah, yeah, champion.
SPEAKER_03: Then there was the Asian Championship in April, then again the Kazakhstan Championship in June and the National Games in June. So I performed a lot. And I just didn't have enough time to get into the right shape, to prepare, to even get on the scales, to have the opportunity. I couldn't fight, I didn't have any sparring at all.
SPEAKER_03: That's why I want to start training after these fights to get to my level. Because I feel that I'm not growing anymore.
SPEAKER_03: So, briefly, he's saying, yes, he used to compete, you mentioned, like, yes, a lot of East versus West, and, like, how many times he competed on the left and right. Yes, he adds that he also competed, like, on four or five national competitions, like Asian Championship, National Championship, some, like, other type of games, which were...
SPEAKER_01: uh hosted like yes in kazakhstan as well so he's saying and he feels that his body is really really really tired next summer in his rest yeah for sure and another question uh darco thank you for your super chat what is revas for now and what will be at east versus west roman we can ask again yeah
SPEAKER_04: I would like to ask you, what is your opinion and how do you think it will be implemented in the future? I think it will be implemented in the future, but I don't think it will be implemented in the future. I think it will be implemented in the future. It will be implemented in the future. Yes, it will be implemented in the future. Yes, it will be implemented in the future. Yes, it will be implemented in the future.
SPEAKER_03: Well, now I have a lot of children and grandchildren, and I have a lot of children. I have about 20 children in my family, and I work with them. Oh, do you have children? Yes, yes, I have all of them.
SPEAKER_04: So he's saying that right now his current form is basically almost the same as he will compete against Morozov. But rest this like 20 days, he will mainly concentrate on like table time and very less on the gym lifts because he has already done this. And last week will be just break. So basically we can say he's almost like as ready as he will be during the match. Yeah, I understand.
SPEAKER_01: And Darko is asking, is Artem 100% ready and healthy to make an upset? I'm sorry about that. Upset with you mean Shafi? What? What do you mean by upset with Shafi? Like he feels after this or? Sorry. Like beating Revaz will cause upset. This is what he means.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Artyom, Darko is asking how ready you are, and are you ready to make an upset with the winner of RIVAZ?
SPEAKER_03: There is still time, so I will be 100% ready. When I rest, when I have good training, I will rest and be 100% ready. And I want to win, but it depends on how it goes.
SPEAKER_03: His cat. He rescued another cat. He just showed it to you. So he was saying that he still has some tough session. And after them, he's going to have time to relax. So as for now, he's saying, yes, he's going to come to the competition in good shape, in 100%. There is a time still. I understand. Yeah, I understand.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, as a friend, or he can even consider as an older brother, I would suggest him to rest because by training, he's not going to get any stronger. He has been training. He has been competing nonstop with someone with that long old training session. I mean, resting is just going to make him stronger because there are a lot of micro injuries. Evgeny if you rest three weeks,
SPEAKER_01: he will be better than training. I mean, maybe very light training, but not to get power. Dead, dead, he will go down. More rest, he will go up. That's what he needs to do. Justin because he doesn't train 20 days, he's not gonna be any weaker. If he didn't train long time before that, I would understand. But me talking about someone nonstop, near a year,
SPEAKER_01: like crazy, training, competing, training, competing, training. He cannot be any worse just because he doesn't train 20 days. But because of healing, he will be even much stronger. That's my opinion. I mean, it is not good that I give him a suggestion because he's going to pull Revaz, but just as an older arm master, just a friendly suggestion. I'll make sure to translate that suggestion to Revaz as well so that he will also...
SPEAKER_03: Well, in short, he doesn't even tell you how to organize a competition, like just an older brother, an older generation of athletes, that you could even just have a better rest than to do something at all, because you are already trained, those who you have left there will not get much, because you have already trained a lot, but just having a rest for three weeks, not some longer term, then it is clear, but three weeks, just having a rest, not doing anything, you will become much stronger.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, he's agreed with your opinion, and he just mentioned that he's planning to do some exercise, but with resistant bands, some static, so like not big weights. Yeah, that's good.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, you can translate if you want, Roman, to what I said. Yeah, briefly, I will translate.
SPEAKER_04: and I don't think it's in the optimal form. I don't think it's possible to get something out of it. And I think it's your choice, what you want to do, what you want to do, what you want to do, what you want to do, what you want to do, what you want to do, what you want to do, what you want to do, what you want to do, what you want to do, what you want to do, what you want to do, what you want to do, what you want to do.
SPEAKER_04: If you think that I don't have the skills to do this, then you are wrong, because Revozi is here, and Revozi knows how to do it. I think Revozi can do it, but it's not a problem. You can ask him if you want to ask him. Thank you. No problem. It's not a problem for me, and it's not a problem for Russian people.
SPEAKER_04: And even before we translated and we spoke English, everything, almost everything that Artum said, he understands Russian. And back then when we were like in August, they spoke to each other with Russian. No problem. So he understands. Oh, so Revaz knows Russian? Revaz knows Russian way better than English. Okay, you don't need to translate this, what Artum says here. Only mine, yeah. And Sabtabi, thank you for your super chat, is asking if Zaur wants to pull
SPEAKER_03: John Brzenk, One Day Again, Some Day Again. Do you agree, Zahur and John? Yes, I agree, and I would like to ask John if he would like to comment on something. Zahur, what did you say? If he would like to comment on something, I would like to ask you. Do you agree, Zahur and John?
SPEAKER_03: What's that? He's asking to him. Yeah, by the way, Sol, Sol Arun, check your messenger.
SPEAKER_04: I was saying that until Zaur gets his like this pain away and starts training and getting back on shape at some point, it is still like quite a long time. He just said that compared to Zaur, comparing to John right now is the form. John is in way better form. Like maybe he even beats him. Like John is such a great form right now because John has come back already like
SPEAKER_04: more than one year right and Zaur has like barely trained anything since he retired so so he said that John would win yeah if they completed but he said that less likely that Zaur will complete because of all this pain and uh like maybe not now but maybe a year later maybe if we motivate him good enough yeah for sure yeah yeah yeah yeah and and Artem uh
SPEAKER_01: Dave you been following the thing between Devon and Prudnik?
SPEAKER_03: Do you follow Devon and Prudnik's fight? Prudnik, of course. To be honest, I've only seen one video of them fighting. I don't follow them at all. I don't go on social media.
SPEAKER_03: Sometimes I don't even answer to my friends, because I do a lot of things, although I don't do anything, but it turns out that I'm always busy with something. He's only one video. He has no amount of time. He doesn't do anything, but still has no time to answer even to some of his friends. That's why he's more now using concentration.
SPEAKER_03: Can you ask him what he thinks if they meet? Who's going to win? Who's going to win? With whom? Between Devon and... Prudnik. Who do you think will win? I think Prudnik will win because he's not the same age.
SPEAKER_01: he's saying that prudnik gonna win because uh come on uh lara's age is um yeah so his his armors are rusty right like they're champions yeah um and can you ask the same question to riva yeah
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Ray was already answered, but I will still ask. I will ask about the score. Best of five.
SPEAKER_01: I want to ask Artyom. Artyom, you were able to beat Dave Chaffee two times with top roll, but it was without the strap.
SPEAKER_03: And Dave Chaffee was very tired on the round five, but when he went to the strap, you couldn't top roll him and you had to hook him. Is it hard to top roll Dave Chaffee in the strap? Yes, he remembers your fight with Dave Chaffee, that you won him twice at the top, but without a tie. But when it came to ties, it didn't work out very well at the top.
SPEAKER_03: He said that in the fifth round he initially made this one into the strap.
SPEAKER_01: Because he decided, he thought that, he decided to try with him in a hook. He don't want to pull him in a top roll. He decided to try him with a hook. He won round three, top roll. Round four, top roll. No strap. Round five, slip. They put strap. He had to hook. So I kind of feel that even Dave was very tired. It is hard to go outside with Dave in the strap.
SPEAKER_03: Was it still hard for you, even though Dave was tired? No, it wasn't hard for me. Moreover, I fought two rounds in the top, because I lost two rounds before that. I wanted to equalize the score. And in the fifth round, I had to fight biceps. Did Gennady do the same? Yes.
SPEAKER_03: I was just listening to Gennady, he didn't tell me what to do. They're joking that Gennady Kukvina told him what he needed to do. Because Gennady also did the same, like, first two rounds top roll. Artur exactly said that first two rounds he did intentionally outside.
SPEAKER_01: First two rounds. First two rounds, he went... No, no, no. First two rounds, Gennady also went outside. That's what I said. Gennady didn't win first two rounds outside. No, no. Did not win, but went outside. Oh, he went outside. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, but he didn't go outside. He lost the round one. And then round two, he tried to hook him. He still lost. He gave some trouble. But round three, round four, he top-rolled him. And round five,
SPEAKER_01: Why did he not top roll? The only difference was round 3, round 4 was without the strap, round 5 was with the strap.
SPEAKER_03: Because I was in a hurry in the second round of biceps, so I lost. I wanted to win the fifth round in biceps. It was the principle. Because he just won initially through the biceps. Because in the second round, he rushed a bit. And that's why he lost. So it was the principle for him. Yes, like personal stuff for him to win in the last final round, to win Dave Chaffee through the biceps.
SPEAKER_01: through the hook. OK. I kind of felt it was 2-2 already. OK. We need to believe in what he says. And he's saying this, so. Can you ask to Revaz what he thinks about Ermes versus Dave Chaffee, Roman? Yeah. Revaz, share us a little bit about Ermes versus Chaffee.
SPEAKER_03: In this situation, Gasparini will be able to win, because Magrath is very strong against Lalleti, and there is no doubt that Magrath will be able to win. I think that Gasparini will be able to win even if he is not in the top form, and Gasparini will be able to win for me.
SPEAKER_03: He said that Gasparini would win in his opinion.
SPEAKER_04: so he like i said he said that gasparini would win in this case and he said the reason would be like given circumstances that he just had a war against vitale and he thinks that uh most likely this time was would not be enough for dave to be 50 days 50 days you know almost two months
SPEAKER_04: so he said like because of this reason if if there was no fight like because gasparini has been preparing so long and dave chaffee just had this match against italy so that's why he's saying i mean they may not consider this match also part of the training that that was a very good training and he rested very well and he says he's ready and he said he's ready he's gonna win you know just sometimes
SPEAKER_01: Your competition is part of the preparation as well, as long as you don't have an injury. Okay, I'll translate. Because you to win that match, you need to be in good shape. You understand what I mean? Yeah, of course.
SPEAKER_04: Anu, I don't know if it's true or not, but if you look at the events and matches, you can see that some of them took place during the pre-training period. I think if you look at the events, you can see that some of them took place during the pre-training period. I think if you look at the events, you can see that some of them took place during the pre-training period. I think if you look at the events, you can see that some of them took place during the pre-training period.
SPEAKER_03: It could be very interesting. But this time Gasparini, he thinks Gasparini. And what does Morozov think about this match? Oh.
SPEAKER_03: Voice, man. He has no voice, huh? I don't hear you. I don't hear you. I got it. I will root for Dave Chaffee because, first of all, I won him. If Dave Chaffee wins, it will be good.
SPEAKER_03: If Dave Chaffee is going to win, it's going to be nice because he won the Dave Chaffee, so he will feel himself better. I understand. But that is his feelings he is expressing about what he would wish. But what is his prediction? Yes, this is what you would like. What are your bets? How do you think the match will go? If...
SPEAKER_03: If Dave Chaffee didn't fix his problem with endurance, Artem gives 3-1, 3-2 maximum to Ermes.
SPEAKER_03: Can you ask him his match in Dubai didn't prove anything to Artem?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I hope. I hope. If he didn't get any injury, I hope it will be the same. But Ermes is very strong. I think. Yes, for sure. He saw it, that he has an endurance. And he wants their match to be like this one. Yes, to let Dave Chaffee show what he did.
SPEAKER_03: So if he has $1,000 in his pocket to bet, where is he going to bet for this match? Are you going to give him? Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Any ways, Dave Chaffee? I understand. Especially from what I understand, he's talking about endurance of Dave. So he is so sure that Dave at least is going to win the first round. That's what he's thinking, right?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, I think it's going to be like this because Dave Chaffee can go
SPEAKER_01: uh as well through top roll and he has a quite powerful strong fingers yeah but so he says that dave chef is fresh power is very strong yeah yeah fingers power yeah and fresh power yeah anyways there is a super chat todd and alex love child thank you for your super chat just bought pay-per-view and can't wait thank you for your support guys this is probably the best card in the history
SPEAKER_01: And please support us so I can even serve you guys better and more. Okay, so if we talk about some other matches as well, quickly we go. And can you ask him what does he think about his left arm match with Ermes?
SPEAKER_03: Shortly and briefly, despite
SPEAKER_03: his injury if you gonna have a proper warm-up and drink some anti-inflammatory and painkillers you won't feel any pain yeah he wants to win he wish to win but he cannot be uh so sure you know and he think his team yeah will win what will win team east i mean okay missed his team is
SPEAKER_01: So you are saying that even if Ermes wins, Ermes is going to win? Yeah. It doesn't sound good. It's a tricky one. Yeah, yeah. I'm happy because Ermes is from the East. You know, if he wins... No, Ermes is from the West. Oh, it's the West? I'm from the East. Oh, okay. I'm more from the East than him. Now, okay. Now, okay.
SPEAKER_03: he says that he's uh i need to do something like him and searching he's more east than erma so for him is from the west for sure a few thousand kilometers more east yeah for sure tell him to not to forget to bring the the the shield this is a title match
SPEAKER_03: I understand, it's a must. But I think it will be so difficult for me to bring him back to Kazakhstan. He understands it. Yes, for sure he's going to take it. But it's going to be so hard for him as well to bring it back to Kazakhstan. So why does he need to do it now? Oh, he doesn't need to bring it, huh? Oh, okay. Okay, I will tell Ermes. I will tell Ermes and let's see what he will think.
SPEAKER_03: He'll pass it to Ermes and we'll see what he says. Can you please ask to Revaz what he thinks about the left arm match? Revaz, do you think that the fight between Morozov and Ermes is going to be good? Yes, it's going to be a good fight. Yes, it's going to be a good fight. Yes, it's going to be a good fight.
SPEAKER_03: He's talking about Morozov. He's a really good guy. Because he has two different matches, right? So it's tough. So, yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: If you don't do something right, you can do something wrong. I don't think it's wrong to do something wrong, but I think that if you do something wrong, if you do something wrong, you can do something wrong, but I think that if you do something wrong, you can do something wrong.
SPEAKER_03: That's because he was the one who gave me the money. And he was the one who gave you the money. Yes, he was the one who gave me the money. Yes, he was the one who gave me the money. He was the one who gave me the money.
SPEAKER_04: okay so he was saying that uh at first he started this answer by uh how surprised he is and quite confused by artem because artem keeps saying that he has pain like uh like in both arms he mentioned today but still he is competing on both arms so which is kind of bold move and quite brave move
SPEAKER_04: so this this uh kind of confused him and but also he said that considering the fact that he had the war against dadikian last time we saw in dubai uh it was really close and tough match for him so he thinks that may also have an effect on his match against ermis so slightly favorite would be ermis on this one and um and yeah because ermis has also all this time been resting yeah basically that's what he said
SPEAKER_01: I reminded about Ermes' left hand when Wagner and he also... Ermes is also recovering. His match was set with Morozov. We cancelled. He had the physiotherapy. And then Tobias got injured. So I asked again to Ermes. He says now he feels better. So that is... So he was not 100% either. But yeah, again, you know, Morozov has been injured. And Morozov, what do you think about Petrenko and Chombrzyn?
SPEAKER_03: What do you think about Oleg Petrenko and John Brzenk? Well, I think Oleg can take one or two rounds, but then John Brzenk will find the key, as always. I think so. But I will support Oleg.
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that Oleg, in his opinion, might take one or two rounds, but then John, based on his experience, will find the key and will win. But despite of this, he's saying he will support Oleg. Yeah, because he's from East? Yes, yes. Ermes' English is getting better.
SPEAKER_01: uh prudnik's also good you know and now we're gonna teach art and morals of good english as well yeah anyway so what does what does revas think about uh john and petrenko that was general speaker about petricos
SPEAKER_04: He thinks that John will be victorious. John will be victorious, yeah, okay. Despite his old age, he still has quite a bunch of tricks up in his sleeves. Speaking of goats, so he's sure that John will figure out something, yeah. I understand. Yeah, because he is, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And Morozov, what do you think about Dzeranov and Kalinichenko? Both are your friends. How do you see this match? Dzeranov and Kalinichenko. No doubt, Dzeranov.
SPEAKER_03: He said like this. I don't believe him, but he said like this. Why you don't believe him? Because my friend is Kalinichenko. I met him in January. I did record some videos. I know how he's confident, how he's hungry to compete, to win, to prove that he deserves it. Can you tell all you just said from your opinion to Morozov? Can you tell him what you think? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: He asked me why I didn't agree with his words, but I said it was because I talked to him, I went to visit him. I saw and felt how hungry he was for victories, and how he wanted to prove in this fight that he was worthy of it.
SPEAKER_03: Well, Dzeranov also hasn't fought for a long time, he also has one goal to win. But, well, I communicate well with them, but I will root for Dzeranov in any case. It seems to me that Dzeranov will win, no matter how well I treat Sergey, that is, we are friends. But here is experience and speed, well, on the side of Dzeranov. You said like Dzeranov also haven't competed for a time.
SPEAKER_03: And he's also hungry to victories as well. And despite that he's a friend with Kalinichenko, Artem, I mean, they talk between each other, yeah, but he will still support Dzeranov because he thinks that on his side, there is an experience. I understand, yeah. And can you ask Revaz if he knows Kalinichenko and Dzeranov?
SPEAKER_04: He is well known with Dzeranov and he knows that Dzeranov is a very strong puller, but Kalinƒçeko he's not familiar with. I could explain, but I don't think he will still recognize because he said he doesn't know. That's why I don't know some of the athletes.
SPEAKER_03: They don't know. But Morozov, you know both Davit Samushia and Daniel Prokopchuk. How do you see that match, Morozov? Samushia, of course. Samushia, Samushia. Samushia is going to win? I think Davit is heavier, I think. Yes, yes, heavier. He's heavier. Which hand is he going to use? The right one?
SPEAKER_04: Right hand, right? Left hand, right hand, right? Right arm, right? Right arm, yeah. How much kg is he asking? 85, but Daniel will be 82 kilo, he's only, he will be 82. Oh, I got it.
SPEAKER_01: And Artem, you remember Pauline, right? Pauline. Pauline? Pauline, yeah. Remember? Pauline. He put with Samushia. Yeah. Samushia and lrakli Gamtenadze. How do you see them now? lrakli Gamtenadze. I haven't fought lrakli for a long time, as far as I understand. Very long time.
SPEAKER_03: But I think lrakli needs endurance. Evgeny if something doesn't work out for him, like going into the hook. lrakli can fight like this, as far as I remember. And he will have the endurance on his side. In his opinion, he's saying lrakli, yes, despite that he hasn't completed, but on his side there is endurance.
SPEAKER_01: he can he can do like a king's move or something so okay king's move is not allowed it's desperation move but it's not allowed i mean if shoulder is above the table yes under no but probably iraqi does when his shoulder is above the table i think anyways uh
SPEAKER_03: and your body is at the level or higher, then it's okay. And to the fact that lrakli, he can even fight, like everyone else, that is, he can fight and go into the hook, but if he stretches a little, I mean, he holds here very well, even in such an open corner, and he can just hold it.
SPEAKER_04: i think i mean he says that his means that iraqli can just take the position and wait wait wait until his opponent will get tired and then pain and and if we ask to revas he will for sure say right yeah between uh iraqli and lean right paul so yeah i will still ask right now there was
SPEAKER_04: lrakli is going to win. Actually, Revaz knows that lrakli and I, we have the same surname. I'm also like lrakli. But yeah, and he said lrakli is going to win. Yeah, and made me to tell you that we are both the same surname.
SPEAKER_01: Anderin Meyer is asking, do they think that Gasparini or Kurdeca can be Levan's level in five years? This question to Artem? Yeah, both of them, but you asked to both of them. I mean, you asked to Levan. Please, can you repeat like who on Levan's level? I mean, does Levan think that Gasparini or Kurdeca can be at Levan's level in five years?
SPEAKER_04: This is a fan question, not my question. Ah, okay, okay. Super chat.
SPEAKER_04: they may reach lebanon's level in running like sprint in running competition and then add him ask the question can he reach to lebanon's level ah same question to him yeah he said he will catch him with jumping
SPEAKER_04: he's gonna reach him no no no he said uh uh he said he will reach levan's level on jumping competition that jumping company but but not in arm wrestling it's it's it's coming also in uh arm wrestling you know that uh is the best like person in the world you know that for sure tell him that i like to hear this every three months
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I won.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, for sure. He's going to be there after next two weeks. He just also mentioned that you are the best guy, like a cyclopedia of armwrestling. You know everything about armwrestling and then also jokingly also said that...
SPEAKER_04: when you are planting not the total okay okay okay
SPEAKER_04: I know he said that he he were like a cyclopedia of pharmacy, you know, or everything about this. And then he was jokingly also reminiscing that how you were was able to remember this 1994, this competition and even the all the names of the athletes. He was like bamboozle like, you know, everything is for Zauras. So Zauras, you and Zauras could not remember everything in detail.
SPEAKER_04: He really doesn't remember. Now Zaur also said in the background, he also doesn't remember if Shaolin beat him. In Israel, Sharon won 100 kilos. When was it? I will also tell you. 1991, Israel. Sharon won 100 kilos. Zaur won super weight.
SPEAKER_01: and then they they they were like i beat you i beat you they went to a room and there they are okay i will translate in detail
SPEAKER_04: Well, let's put it this way, if you want to go on like this, if you want to go on like this, if you want to go on like this, if you want to go on like this, if you want to go on like this, if you want to go on like this, if you want to go on like this,
SPEAKER_04: So about outside of the competition like in the in background like they they have pulled but when I told him that like Zaur said that he never pulled him under 100 kg or so like. No not under 100, side table for money for betting.
SPEAKER_03: Zaur keeps saying that
SPEAKER_01: physically there would not be he would not be able to uh uh so he's still rejecting the idea
SPEAKER_03: Levan's level in five years. And also what does he think about himself? You have the same question as I do. What do you think, in the next five years, will Gasparini or Kurdesha be able to grow to the level of Levan? And what do you think about it? What do you think? How can you do it? Let's discuss this topic. How many years
SPEAKER_03: Ermes Gasparini and Alex Kurdeci. He said that let's think from the way how old is Ermes and how old is Alex. I think both are at least 30, in my opinion. I think Ermes is still 29, probably. Yeah, 29, 30, whatever. No, he says 30, 29.
SPEAKER_03: Both, right? And Levan is 34. I think if Levan quits the sport, we will all compete with him in 5 years if he stops doing it.
SPEAKER_03: It's like, the thing is that Levane is now 34, yes? And he's still already like dominant for how long? So it's a question also if he will continue to compete on the same level, you know? So this is a question also.
SPEAKER_01: I understand. Vasily, if you need to go, you can go. No, no, no, no, no. They're just fixing the stuff, my neighbor. Devon't worry. Okay, okay. Yeah. Permission. My wish is for Levan to continue to fight. This is the best card yet. And again, Morozov is my favorite. Thank you very much for your support, my friend. Thank you very much. And yeah, I think that is basically...
SPEAKER_01: what it is and yes is there is there is there anything that uh oh yeah also i want to have one more
SPEAKER_03: First I want to say that Morozov said that he wants Levan to continue to compete. He wants him to still be on the same level. And later on in the future he would be able to face Levan. So Morozov has such a goal, huh?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, to face with Levan, but he also wants him to be on his peak, not like... I understand, I understand. Did you ask him about Wagner Bortolato and Dzeranov, left arm? He said Dzeranov. Oh, Dzeranov is going to beat him? So can you ask him, is it going to be a harder match for him with Wagner or with Kalinichenko?
SPEAKER_03: Two questions in one. Will it be hard for Dzeranov to fight Wagner? And which fight will be harder, with Wagner or with Kalinichenko? I think it will be harder to fight Seryoga.
SPEAKER_03: Sergey is very technical, I think. I've never fought with him, but I think he's very technical. And Wagner is more of a showman, I think. He said that in his opinion, Kalinichenko is going to be a tougher opponent for Dzeranov because Kalinichenko is a more technical guy rather than Bortolato, who is more of a showman.
SPEAKER_01: But does he know that Bortolato is many times world champion in waffles? He was so small at that time. Yeah, he was small, but I'm just reminding him he's not showman. He has been winning waffles for many, many years. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And the last question to both of them. I want them to tell me what is their top five right now in the world. Let's start with Rewas. Okay. Sorry? Any weight? No, top five. Who is the top five in his opinion? Including himself.
SPEAKER_04: It's quite tough to just say all these names.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it's a relatively easy decision to make. It's a meds masovic.
SPEAKER_04: So he's saying that, for sure, Levan is number one, but all the rest, four guys, those names, he needs time to take time and think about it and also to see what time he shows us.
SPEAKER_04: and those ratings that's been made like we have seen several type of ratings in this website he also doesn't follow them like as if they were like correct so he he doesn't know he's not sure about top five himself is in sapphire right now
SPEAKER_03: Okay, as humble as he is, he would say he's number five.
SPEAKER_01: OK, then now, even if it is not in order, I would like to know three points ahead of you. And another question, does he think he is number five because of what is proven till now, or does he think that
SPEAKER_01: Is he fifth because he didn't prove more than this or he thinks that he is fifth because he really cannot beat number four, number three, number two, whoever those guys are? Good question.
SPEAKER_04: Is it because you were told that Danashen was going to win 4-0, or is it because you don't know what you're going to win and you don't know what you're going to win in 2015? No, I don't think so. I don't know what I'm going to win. I don't know what I'm going to win. I don't know what I'm going to win. I don't know what I'm going to win.
SPEAKER_03: In my opinion, if you look at it, there is no doubt that this is a good thing, it is not a bad thing.
SPEAKER_03: And there are some stages that you can't get out of it. That's why I'm telling you that there are people who have been killed in the history of Klauzhid. I have never been killed in this way. And that's why I'm telling you that you can't get out of it and you can't get out of it. You know what I mean? If you get caught, you can't get out of it.
SPEAKER_03: Arun, you had a lot of problems and you didn't say what you were going to do next. Yes, I had a lot of problems. Seriously, I didn't have the strength to go to that stage. I didn't have the strength to say what I was going to do next. And you didn't go to that level, did you? No, I didn't. Okay, there you go.
SPEAKER_04: So he's saying that this, when he said number five, it was obviously a joke. Because he clearly, he really, like if we ask him seriously, he seriously cannot...
SPEAKER_04: uh provide us with the correct order even even himself when he would where he would rank himself and he suggested like something like top eight or something like this type of competition for heavyweights uh would would help him personally to have a clear idea where he stands and where are other top five people right
SPEAKER_04: And he said also, underline the fact that current super heavyweights that we have today in armwrestling world, in armwrestling history has never been like this, in his opinion. Like right now, super heavyweight category is so high. Level is high. So that's why he clearly has no clear names, those three names who you also asked. We have been organizing so many matches, you know, he should have some opinion.
SPEAKER_03: Anyway, so you can ask Morozov the same question. What does he think is top five? Artyom, in your opinion, top five? Right hand. Right hand, left hand, or generally? Right hand. Right hand.
SPEAKER_03: Morozov. No, Livano. Okay, so first one is Morozov, second is Lizarano.
SPEAKER_03: No, yes, that's what Morozov said, but Revaz said that number one is Reran, not Morozov. I think the second one... I think Vitaly, after all. Then... Ermes. Alex. Although maybe it's Ermes or Alex, they're third or fourth. I don't know, I think Alex beat Ermes.
SPEAKER_03: but Daewoo Chaffee lost. In short, it's not clear. Okay, Levan, Vitaly, Dave, Alex, Ermes. Levan is the first, Laletin second, Sir Dave Chaffee fourth. Is it Kurdesha or Gasparini? Kurdesha.
SPEAKER_01: Alex Kurdechev vs. Ermes Gasparini. Okay, the part I don't understand it. Vitaly lost Zaur, Vitaly lost Ferit, Vitaly lost Dave Chaffee and he still ranks him number two? Yes. Can you ask him his reasons for this? Why exactly do you think Vitaly is in second place despite his losses to Farid Usman, Dave Chaffee, yes? Zaur is also in second place.
SPEAKER_03: Well, because if Vitaly is in good shape without injuries, I think he's still in second place. But if we take into account that he lost now, okay, we'll take him out of second place, put him in second place, let's say, Zaur Paisulaev and Farid Usmanov in third place. Okay, let it be so.
SPEAKER_03: So if we're going to consider his current loss, yes, to those guys who you mentioned. Okay, let's do like this. First is Levan, second is Zaur, third is Farid. Yeah. And do you think that Zaur also proved enough that only he puts him by because of being in Latin? How do you think, Zaur really proved his strength and his, let's say,
SPEAKER_03: Do you have any complaints about the victory over Vitalik in the Top 5? I think so. Yes, thank you. And he put Dave Chaffee in the Top 5, but not himself? You put Dave Chaffee in the Top 5, but not yourself? I don't consider myself in the Top 5.
SPEAKER_03: No, he's not ranking himself in the top five. Yeah, but did he not beat Dave Chaffee?
SPEAKER_03: He said that in this case, if he's going to pull himself into the top five, Dave Chaffee will be out from the top five, but he won't let him stay. So he gave his place to Dave. So he's giving a favor to Dave, according to him.
SPEAKER_01: he he wants dave to be in top five respect he respect it's like kind of a gesture of respect you know okay so this is the list that you know the athletes the way he respects the most who he respects the second but this is not the armless ranking but the ranking of the respect okay and he says he says in his opinion something more like a list of someone you respect more than
SPEAKER_03: Because I don't follow those who are fighting.
SPEAKER_03: If I see it, I will watch it. There is no difference at all. The main thing for me is to show the result. In this regard, I am a one-man team. –ü–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω –Ω–µ —Ç–∞–∫ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–ª–µ–¥—É–µ—Ç –∑–∞ –≤—Å–µ–º–∏ —Å–æ—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è–º–∏, –∏ –∫—Ç–æ –∫–∞–∫. –ï—Å–ª–∏ —É –Ω–µ–≥–æ –µ—Å—Ç—å –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –ø–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å —á—Ç–æ-—Ç–æ, —Ç–æ –¥–∞, –æ–Ω –±—É–¥–µ—Ç —Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å, –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä–∏—Ç—å, –∏ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å —á—Ç–æ-—Ç–æ –æ–± —ç—Ç–æ–º. –ë–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –µ–≥–æ —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ –æ–Ω –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–µ—Ç –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–±–µ –∏ –Ω–∞ –º–∞—Ç—á–µ.
SPEAKER_01: So he is basically saying that he went to Dubai,
SPEAKER_01: on the same night that he took dave but he didn't follow that match that's why he put it in here and dave sheffield below that because he didn't have free time while he was in dubai okay you can tell not exactly this he mentioned before that he said that if dave if vitaly will come to the match in his hundred percent ready yes we should ignore the result
SPEAKER_01: should we should we ignore the result or just what whatever like once athlete accepts a match and then goes there accepts the rules accepts the result and everything you cannot say that oh if i was like this if i was like there may be reasons for sure it's not excuse but if the result is there we cannot put opinion
SPEAKER_01: over the result because because there is a competition i mean why do they even compete against each other if if the result of the match is gonna be lower than their opinion you know why do things happen they accept they go they compete whatever the result is dave do you think that dave cheffy doesn't have any health issues you know like he doesn't have any neck problem he doesn't have any
SPEAKER_01: who is the arm master that has no problems i mean who is he yeah yeah so i mean so okay never mind just tell artem morozov that i never asked him this question and i'm glad he's not making the right no you see you ask his opinion he gives his opinion you might not know you are not his advocate you are
SPEAKER_03: He says that he will think that he didn't ask you this question, because for him it means that no matter how someone expects, if you agreed to come out on the table, then you have to accept the results and base your opinion on them. And not on who is fresh and who is not. I understand.
SPEAKER_03: Again, this rating is very variable, but the number one at the moment is Lebanon. All the others who are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, it's a mess already. There's nothing clear there. It's very difficult. Well, let's say Alex won against Ermes, but lost to Dave Chaffee. It's difficult here. Dave Chaffee won.
SPEAKER_03: Vitalia.
SPEAKER_03: so he's saying uh you know yes his agree was used right now but still right now is it's so complicated to check who is exactly third second and fourth because everyone compete everywhere yeah uh the winners are mixed but for sure the first place is levan the second third fourth and etc it's so mixed cocktail you know you can you cannot for sure say who is on whose place after the first level
SPEAKER_01: okay okay thank you and i think this is the end of the conversation thank you for translating roman thank you vasily i wish you always with you again i hope you will be fine i really feel sorry that this is not good as an arm master i can understand your pain next week i'm gonna meet uh arton we might do some live with him directly from his flesh yeah yeah okay that would be good yeah just just
