SPEAKER_02: I get out and I come back. You let me, you guys let me, okay? Sounds good. Okay. Let's see here. Everybody says the sound is good online. How are you, John? Oh, I can't hear you now. Technology.
SPEAKER_01: You guys might have a podcast with just me. Aren't you lucky? Can you hear me, John? I can't hear you. Let's see. My volume's up.
SPEAKER_00: weird it's funny everybody online saying that everything's perfect oh no we can't hear you i can't hear john either now i hear good you guys hear me well i can hear you again i can't hear john though oh okay maybe john was nice but now because problem was with my phone and then maybe i missed his sound
SPEAKER_00: by changing something. What does people say on the chat? People say they can't hear John, but they can hear us. Okay, they hear us, but not John. Correct. We don't hear you. I mean, I don't hear it. Can you do the beginning one? Because some people said that
SPEAKER_00: Your sound was okay because I couldn't hear. Pradeep wrote me a message. He said, your sound is okay. Okay. You do the beginning. How about now? Now? Yes. All right. Let's go. You would think we've done this enough times that we would remember, get this shit down, but it's still impossible. Yeah. I think it was my fault. Yeah. So it's very early there, huh, John? Seven o'clock?
SPEAKER_03: Yep, 7 o'clock, but I got up early. I normally get up around 4.30, so I was up by 5.30 today, so no worries, everybody. Wow, 4.30, huh? You're Americans. Well, I start work at 6, so it takes me a little while to drink coffee and take a shower, and then it's about a half-hour commute to work, so it takes time. I don't work from home like some people do. And how are the trainings?
SPEAKER_03: Training's been going good. I probably, you know, I told you I took about a, I don't know, six, eight week break of doing basically nothing, just trying to rehab my body. I think it was arm wrestling a little bit too much because after about the third or fourth week, I started feeling like aches and pains I didn't know I actually even had. It's like, whoa, that hurts and that hurts. But yeah, I've got about three, four good workouts in. And yeah, I've been struggling with trying to figure out how to manage, you know, the
SPEAKER_03: old age issues the arthritis and the aches and pains and stuff so it's kind of a balancing act between trading you know training too hard and and um you know causing myself to hurt versus you know trying to you know just stay stay healthy
SPEAKER_03: And how do you feel now? Do you feel like you recovered? Yeah, I feel pretty good. I feel pretty good. My weight's down. I'm within striking distance of 230. So I've been riding. I bought an electric bike. And some people will laugh and say, well, that's not exercise. But for me, being so out of shape, my electric mountain bike has really been keeping me
SPEAKER_03: you know um in pretty good shape i live right next to a bike uh trail here system that makes it super easy just to jump on and go so um i've been in fact the other day i went for almost two hours so i came back and uh my legs have never had the kind of work they've had in the last uh few weeks so it's i think it's helping my cardio a little bit i mean yeah probably probably not but i'm i'm telling myself that it's it's actually helping so it makes me feel a little bit better
SPEAKER_03: You're in the minority. Some wrestlers don't do any cardio. Yeah, well, some people actually even feel that it's that, you know, it has a negative effect on their power, on their strength. But yeah, overall health, feeling good throughout the day. I think it's definitely important. It's just it's just hard to do, especially when you get a little bit older and you feel a little bit achy. And, you know, there's always that feeling. I just don't feel like doing it, you know. So, yeah, no, it really is.
SPEAKER_03: Because your match is 231 set with Oleg Petrenko. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's been nice. Yeah. So I'm hoping to maybe just continue to do that. It's, what, four or five weeks away yet. So, yeah. And then normally the last couple of weeks I'm not doing anything. I can, you know, cut a pound or two, you know, where I'm not training or anything. So, yeah, I'm looking forward to it. Hopefully everything works.
SPEAKER_03: works out good and right now where are you like because you stopped training i know you are healthy but probably you are not as trained you know um it's you know it's it's hard to say for me i mean sometimes i think i i was pushing it so hard for the months previous uh the corey match and hunger buy up and um i think the the extended rest has probably done me more good than than bad
SPEAKER_03: i mean yes my brain kind of says that i'm i shouldn't be as in good shape because i really haven't been you know arm wrestling as much and training as much but i mean i don't know i think for me at this point in my life i think feeling healthy is more way more important than being at a high level you know strength wise or training wise so um if i can get my body to feel good um get rid of the uh the shoulder aches which is the really the limiting factor for me you know
SPEAKER_03: the last 10 years probably, then I'm going to be better on the table. I'm going to be stronger. I might not be better going to the gym and lifting, but I think I'm going to be a lot more effective on the table. So I'm feeling good going into this. I mean, I feel like I'm not overly trained, and I'm well rested. John, when I had this stem cell therapy,
SPEAKER_00: And the guy was checking everything and he, I don't know how he understood, but he said, you have a, and then you have a damage here and it's a nerve damage. And he gave me some vitamin B12 injection for six days. And he said that, yes, you have like cartilage missing in joints is damaged. He can see all, but he said that, you know, some of your strength
SPEAKER_00: said engine is gone because the the the signal is not coming that healthy so there is a nerve damage he said and he said that this is gonna um probably that's the reason that the the the the right is not as quick fast of course yeah but but even even if it's not damaged i think it's just an old age issue right i mean our
SPEAKER_03: our, our quickness, our speed that I've, I've said it a hundred times that it just, just diminishes as you get older. So, I mean, man, that's, that was such a huge factor for me personally, when I was younger, it was, it had a lot to do with my effectiveness on the, on the arm wrestling table. I wasn't that strong, but I was able to generate that explosive hit that, that most strong men couldn't. So, but as I've gotten older, I've, I've not been able to do that. And it's not,
SPEAKER_03: from lack of training it's just just age so you have to adjust and now become kind of more of a you know a strength puller and a defensive puller and it really changes things when and when you relied on that that explosive hit so so much as a kid
SPEAKER_00: But yeah, no, B12 sounds like an interesting thing that he would say is healing the nervous system. Yeah, he said that it's in my home. I didn't start yet because I want to first recover from this because I still cannot really
SPEAKER_00: fists with these fingers you see that they are gotcha right i did it here he he said that especially these two are very damaged i think these two are getting the most pressure he said that this is the last damage because i don't think it is getting so much but you know right right the most damage yeah right and yeah he told me and then he said use it like six days in a row you know and whenever i go back you know home i'm at the world championships right now as a trainer
SPEAKER_02: I'm already in Antalya, Joshua. You coming tomorrow? Yeah, I'm leaving in a few hours, so I'll be there tomorrow evening. Oh, yeah. Grandmasters, huh? Yeah, grandmasters. That's my jam, man. You ready? All right. Yeah, I'm ready. I mean, my right arm is almost better. My left arm feels a lot better than last year, so hopefully. Let's see. Let's see.
SPEAKER_00: um i can't i can't see the chat if you see any super chat you can you can tell me yeah i will do i will do yeah because i don't see it so john uh i want i invited petrenko but you know we just said it is like 5 00 a.m in the morning with my time so he get up he said he he has to go to a wedding close friend of him uh getting married at the same time so
SPEAKER_00: Also, there is WAF Congress right now. President Niazi told me to join to translate, but I said, no, I'm going to meet John. I don't think I've ever met Petrenko. How is his English? Does he speak any English at all? No. No, zero. Okay. The other day, did you see that he was doing like many reps with 240 kilo squats? Oh, shoot. No, I ignore that stuff. I try not to even look at that. I don't want to get all psyched out, you know.
SPEAKER_00: he is not as good as arm as you like like i mean but he's strong you know yeah no i i he's not like super technical guy like ongar but he's solid you know but yeah yeah yeah it is better for you that that you can apply your power even the opponent is stronger
SPEAKER_03: But you can't apply, you understand? It just depends on how solid and strong his hand and wrist are. I mean, if he's as strong as the guy that I pulled at the Moldovan tournament, Marat.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, if he's able to control me inside, then he's going to have his way with me. So if I can somehow keep the match outside. His wrist is not as solid as that. Not as solid as that. So that's good. I've actually watched some of their matches where those two pulled. And I'm sorry, I'm messing up his name. Marat, is that how you pronounce his name? Margarine. Margarine.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. He ended up taking him almost to the pad, but then Petrenko caught him and then drug him back and beat him. So I'm like, oh, shit. Petrenko has more horsepower, but the other guy has a strong wrist. Strong wrist. He can put it in a good position. And then once you catch him, the horsepower plays, but Petrenko's wrist this way is not... Not it's going to be the same. Okay. Well, that's good.
SPEAKER_03: yeah right raymond's antonovich from latvia uh was able to stay outside okay yeah yeah yeah so that gives me hope but yeah no i'm looking forward to it um yeah i mean i guess you probably heard the news that um i guess i'm being tracked down by
SPEAKER_03: uh the monster from Russia uh Dennis link off so um that's a that's a scary thought actually I was you know I was like bring it on but after watching some of his footage recently and after watching him pull a king of the table too I'm thinking oh he's looking like he's super strong three people asking you about that match in the chat about oh yeah
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes, for sure. I want to take the match just because it's Dennis. And, you know, we both deserve to pull each other one more time, I guess, you know, both been kind of out of it.
SPEAKER_03: But yeah, that's going to be an extreme, extreme challenge. I'm going to have to ask for the, I watched your program with Devon the other day about the hustle strap. I need to have, I need to be on the good side with the hustle strap the first round and wear him out somehow to make it close. I have a feeling I'm going to be going in as a strong underdog. So, but yeah, it was exciting to hear that he wants to pull. So maybe we'll see that happen in February.
SPEAKER_02: I was going to say, John, do you think that there's going to be an issue with him returning to the sport after so long away, similar to what we saw with Eric?
SPEAKER_03: i i don't i i know he's been pulling with david uh datacon and um david looks strong against all the top arm wrestlers i i don't know why he's not putting his hat in the ring for right-handed super matches but um that guy looks like he could take on almost anybody and and dennis is holding him and and doing stuff with him and has been for months now so um
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I don't think I don't think I mean, I hear them saying, Oh, we're not sure if Dennis is gonna be we made one more doctor check and see if he's ready for his comeback. I'm like, he's he's plenty strong already. He's, he's already made a comeback. He's already been arm wrestling for how many months now, at a super high level point with Davit.
SPEAKER_03: that just just you know i don't know what more they're they're thinking that you know to make sure that he's able to to can you know be competitive or compete at a high level i to me it's visible that he's already there but you know his his shape was good enough to just see 99 beat 99.9 of the public right maybe maybe he needs it once told me that engine
SPEAKER_00: I was in best ever shape, like better than you have seen me, you know, another time. And he said he directly went to pull Dennis. And he said, Engin, I hit him as I have never hit anyone else. And he said that he hit the wall. He said that like a bus hit him. And then he said, how long the match was? He said one second. And he said next day, he felt like a bus hit him, you know.
SPEAKER_00: He was in pain everywhere because he hit him so hard. You know, people see his match with Dennis after Pushkar and Dennis killed each other. But, you know, when the guy is really fresh, he was just a different animal. Right, right. So, I mean, the big question will be for most people, including myself, can Dennis get to the level to give LeBron a match? Like I said, he's, to me, he's at, he's at,
SPEAKER_03: the pinnacle of 99.9. Other than LeVon, I think Dennis probably could at his current state could probably pull with anybody right now. Whether or not he can get to super massive debt, Dennis said pull Devon and actually give LeVon
SPEAKER_03: know stop lavon somehow and and give him a match that that's the question that needs to be be asked but um yeah my personal opinion the best of leon would be best of dennis
SPEAKER_03: but just open you would you would think just because of the the hand and the the size domination that levon would have he would be able to put dennis out of position but devin's there dennis has got that that that pronating not worried about losing your hands you know almost king's move lock i mean he doesn't need to use the king's move because his biceps so strong but he's got an incredible you know sticking point there that might
SPEAKER_03: be just enough to stop levon and you know like i said we still don't know how you know all that muscle and that size is still the same little heartbeat in there that you know does his does his endurance level go down you know down really quick if he gets stopped so i'd still like to see it i'd still like to see it yeah first round when when levon when pure outside like wrist to wrist you know
SPEAKER_00: Right. Against Devon, he was just like one something. He hardly came to the pad. Right. But the round two, whenever he went more sideways. Right. Blast right through. Yeah. Yeah, of course. So I don't know that kind of pressure on the round two. People said Devon got injured, but Devon got injured because of that hit and pressure. Right. Of course. So I don't know if that kind of side pressure that flashed Devon. I don't know if anyone had
SPEAKER_03: that strong terrible right right well yeah so the question is whether or not dennis is stronger than devin to be able to stop that stop that yeah and then then we'd see maybe possibly a match i mean i don't i'm not saying that dennis has the kind of endurance that devin does but um maybe i mean maybe it would be interesting well i mean he's the only
SPEAKER_03: So there's a few other competitive matches out there that I mean, Jerry Catarat with the dump rest getting locked in there. You know, if LeBron doesn't play a smart, it kind of be, you know, a little lazy and just figures he can just control it. It might be able to do something. Every week he's like, I'm telling you, I can, I'm the one that's going to be LeBron. Stop that. It negates his strengths a lot, you know, of course, because he doesn't care. And he just, if he can get jammed in there, it might be enough, but.
SPEAKER_00: Levan's a beast. I mean, he might just turn things different. Irma says that, you know, when Levan has this position, he said he's like solid and to go this way is so strong. He's saying that the way to beat Levan is top role. And he said that he's the one that, you know, who has the chance.
SPEAKER_03: he's got he's got that posting style top roll that's effective against strong hand pullers like that so yeah i mean i would agree with him i mean i think even even um you know well he's got the same style as travis does i mean if travis gets big again and gets throws his hat in the ring and starts arm wrestling hard and solid again he's another one that's explosive enough that
SPEAKER_03: could do something more like right now lately it's just more like you know this Travis is more like you know yeah well yeah Ermes needs to he needs to be like that with Jerry he needs to definitely um not yeah not be so much back pressure because he'll end up putting himself in a horrible position yeah he needs to be almost his hand needs not to be pronated at all it needs to be this way into Jerry I mean um
SPEAKER_00: But it's a gutsy move when you got such a big guy, you know. I remember two days before the last East versus West, and we were eating, and I said, like, do you really believe that, you know, Jerry, like, can beat Gennady? And you said, like, just if Gennady tries to top roll? And he said, just watch. This is what you said. I was like, are you serious? And you said, yeah, just watch it. And do you have any similar feeling if Jerry is stronger?
SPEAKER_00: Then August, because in August he just had like two and a half year break and then three months preparation. He came to August. Now he had another three and a half months. So my question is, do you think that if, if Jerry's 10, 15% stronger than what we saw last time, do you think that like, or what is his chance about, you know, beating Ermes or what's changed?
SPEAKER_03: against it is it about the power or is it about the pulling the right style yeah both of them have plenty of power to beat the other it's going to be about in my mind it's going to be about technique it's going to be about ermy's being in his head uh confident enough and brave enough to stand up with jerry and and and take him and be aggressive and i know army has got the speed to get him off center if he is tentative or has any doubt in his mind at all and lets jerry get
SPEAKER_03: just this much you know behind his arm then then it's going to be a whole different ball game for ermie so hermes needs to make sure that that that balance tips his direction ever so slightly if he does and he doesn't run away from jerry um then i think he's going to have the side pressure and the power to put jerry in a bad position and possibly flash jerry
SPEAKER_03: So I think it's going to be, you know, Jerry's going to come in probably with the mindset that he always does. I don't see that variable being as big as the confidence that Ermes is going to have to have, you know, that bravery and being spot on right and not being intimidated. But I think Ermes is capable if he goes in with the right game plan and attitude. The thing is,
SPEAKER_03: Jerry is going to do what he has been doing for the last 30 years while Ermes needs some modification. The evidence is out there. Ermes can definitely do his research and see the few arm wrestlers in the world that have been effective against Jerry and see how they approach Jerry. But it's still different watching and then actually getting across the table.
SPEAKER_03: Do you see the match like this? Yes, of course. I feel the match is going to be all about the setup and all about the go. It's going to be more about reaction and speed and just awareness and getting where you want to be than it is going to be about strength. I think the match is going to be won or lost on the go, on the setup. So Ermes is the one who shouldn't make any mistakes.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he just needs to be confident. Yeah, not not so much mistake. I mean he just needs to be spot on off at the at the ready. You know when right before they say go and have it in his mind that this is, you know, it doesn't feel right, but this is the best position and way to pull against Jerry. It's gotta be aggressive and it has to be knocking him off center. Devon't let him get behind his arm and don't let him bust his wrist back. Devon't let him jump his own wrist.
SPEAKER_03: Let me ask you, do you think that fouls are going to play a big part in the decision? Well, anytime Jerry's up on the arm wrestling table, there's fouls. Well, typically because people are trying to still extend Jerry out and Jerry's still trying to, you know,
SPEAKER_03: apply that side pressure so the people are it's not completely jerry's fault that people are running off the back of the table and trying to pull jerry out but jerry's trying to save himself but in keeping that a decent angle by coming off the off the front of the pad and sometimes it ends up completely coming off the front of course it's funny i mean it's they're almost you know they're almost arm wrestling the same they could arm wrestle on a little one centimeter pad because they they're both shifted
SPEAKER_00: that full eight inches or whatever it is of the elbow pad. Right. I mean, so, um, yeah, that's what I'm worried about. I'm worried because I know Engen is going to have a little bit tighter roughing for that match. Yeah, but the pads will be from front and sides and back will be one centimeter bigger.
SPEAKER_00: one or something from back so jerry will have one something more from the back front and then enemies will be one something which is equal and then from the size but we will say hey listen jerry you have one more something at the front there must be one more something from the back
SPEAKER_03: So it equals. So the distance between their elbows is what's key with Jerry. I mean, if Jerry had his way, I'm sure he would love to arm wrestle on a table that's closer. The elbow pads are closer together, of course. Right. So like on W.A.L. when they're they're really far apart. I mean, Jerry's going to have a Jerry has a really difficult time because somebody has that much room to really create that.
SPEAKER_00: long angle Jerry can't really get that you know we also have extra space but any any even tiny from from here this way is okay but if it is out from the edges I will call it because then yeah I get headache so much headache why you didn't call it right I have nothing to do I tell refugees to just call what it is and then at the end
SPEAKER_03: I get all the right hopefully hopefully we'll see Ermes not running off the back of the table I think that's a mistake I think Ermes needs to stand tall and and fight and and have the confidence that he has the the power to to to um go through Jerry's you know the center um if if Ermes is in the mindset of he needs to run away
SPEAKER_00: it's going to be you know then it's going to end up being bad for hermes and it's going to be how about like pulling again you know jerry goes like this and he press you know like but if you somehow curl his pronator and put him this position right it is hard to use the tricep your tricep will work that way now it's working there so
SPEAKER_00: like is it possible that you know with your bottom finger and bottom wrist tendon here to just a little bit side pressure and curl and roll and yeah you said that he shouldn't go back you know going back this way with the brachial radialis and going back this way but not pulling your elbow only
SPEAKER_00: but just making a lock here right and then you want you want to you want his arm to hit you here and so you almost want to be that's needs to be your top role it can't be like this no no no if it's like that right that's why I said that the curling not from this tendon but from here right and you know
SPEAKER_03: roving and opening his biceps so that you know we are we all we are none of us are uh yeah it all sounds good in theory until you get up against that 300 plus pound monster and he's like breathing fire on you and you're like oh i need to get away from this yeah yeah yeah two super chats and again they're both about uh dennis and then for john the first one is from lavon's liver
SPEAKER_03: And he's like, what body weight would you plan at for Dennis? And what kind of training would you do? Well, my training is my training. It'll be the same. I mean, I am who I am. I don't expect to be able to gain any much more weight. I got way uncomfortable. And I think I was not as effective when I got up to 250 to pull Devon. I think...
SPEAKER_03: It caused a lot of negative effects as far as my endurance and blowing up way too easily and quick. Possibly peak weight would be 240 pounds. It seems to be a pretty comfortable, just eat whatever I can eat type of weight.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but training, like I said before, at my age, I can't really train harder because it's got to be a balancing act. Because if I train too hard or try to push it too hard, I think I become hurt and more inflamed and I've just become less effective. So, yeah, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the key is just training just enough to be sharp. And like I said, for me, it's more important to be healthy and not have that inflammation and not have that soreness here and there and wherever else than it is to be extra bulky, extra strong, a little bit extra muscle.
SPEAKER_03: uh but yeah for dennis i don't know i don't know i i gotta i would have to figure something out like some type of game plan i don't know i obviously i can't compete with them in a hook and um my only chance would be to top wrong um and i don't even know if that's possible but um
SPEAKER_03: yeah I'd still give it my best in my best effort I think the way that you pull against him in Vegas in a super match is the way that you should pull what you will yeah but but look but looking back on that I you know I'll be honest with myself that you know he was kind of young he wasn't as good as he he ended up turning into or probably possibly is what he is even now I think he's stronger
SPEAKER_03: and definitely smarter. In Vegas, even though it wasn't any strategy of my own, you know, looking back, especially with all that talk lately about the hustle strap, I was on the good side of the strap. It was the old way to apply the strap. It was the hustle strap. Old six rounds? Come on. No, no, no, no, the first round. But in a six-round match, that plays such a key, important role.
SPEAKER_03: role in the outcome of the six matches because of those factors and that first match of taking him out of position and having him pull as hard as he did, it ruined him for the next six matches. If the rules were reversed and he had the good side of the strap in that first round, I think even at that time, he was probably strong enough to put me out of position that I would have worked
SPEAKER_03: extra hard and and then it could have been easily six zero for for Dennis so um I think I think everything was perfectly in place at that time in Vegas um yeah so I I don't I don't see that repeating but I I I see you uh too humble yeah well I I I just know you know I I understand the situation better now especially um yeah but
SPEAKER_03: Your face looked like you were in control the whole time. I was in control. Yeah, but it was almost like, well, I'll switch the roles and say that this happened to me exactly the way I made it happen to Dennis is my match with Devon.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, he had the good side. It was the hustle strap. He, he basically destroyed me mentally and physically after the first match that I just was like, I could never, I could never recoup. I mean, it's, you know, when you're talking about a minute, two minute rest and you expend that kind of energy, um,
SPEAKER_03: it ruined you. I mean, I, I felt the same way, even though, you know, the hustle strap wasn't used. It was just the regular strap. I felt my match with Unger Bayev when the, when the position switched and I got on the bad side and I felt like,
SPEAKER_03: he got just enough jump instead of letting it go. If I'm fighting, expanding the energy in the defensive position, especially, well, I guess it just depends on who you are. I mean, if you're somebody that's got great endurance, that doesn't seem to have
SPEAKER_03: be a big, huge factor, but for someone that, that relies on still a little bit of expulsivity, um, that's, that basically ruins the super match. I mean, there's just no way to re for, for me personally, or a lot of people that are explosive arm wrestlers to recover in that amount of time. So there has to be some, you know, definite strategy as far as, as that goes in my mind, anyway, it's still important to me. I mean, uh,
SPEAKER_03: How can you and Todd Hutchings, like he thinks that it doesn't make any difference at all. Well, you know, I watched in the past, it was making so much difference. But yeah, well, and Devon is absolutely correct in that the way the old strap was applied, it was a huge difference. But the new strap is debatable. And in watching your guys discussion, I'm thinking to myself, OK, well,
SPEAKER_03: you can both be right. I think that the strap, the buckle on the, on your opponent's hand still is a disadvantage. I think it's still an advantage to not have the buckle, but there's another, there's another couple of variables in there that, that Todd is not,
SPEAKER_03: not using for his argument okay so statistically he's looking at matches left side right side yeah but that it's also not symmetrical i mean the the you're the referee's on the right side of you now instead of on the left side of you so there's other factors that are playing that might equal out the fact that the strap is in my mind still an advantage when i don't have the buckle um
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think building style probably makes a big difference, too. I mean, if you're in top row versus top row, it makes a difference. Yeah. Yeah. For me, for me, it's huge for me. For me, any benefit of being on the left of the referee versus being on the right of the referee.
SPEAKER_03: is is way less than me having not not having the buckle still even with the fair even with the fair strap I'd rather always just have the not have the buckle and be on whatever side but for a lot of people it doesn't matter and obviously statistically it's showing that being to the left of the referee is sometimes better than being you know on the right of the referee so
SPEAKER_03: There's other factors. I mean, if the referee switched positions too, then I think maybe Todd's, you know, Hutchins' statistics might be a little bit more in line with the way I feel that how the strap has an effect on the outcome. Yeah. When I go...
SPEAKER_00: Like I tried, you know, usually I had solid wrist and then I didn't so much feel that like during my career. But whenever I really paid attention, you know, if both guys are going top row, that buckle is just a little bit enabling your ability. But if the one is going inside, one is going outside or both going inside, it's just kind of different. Negates it, right.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Like I told them that, you know, it is, they said that it is not about the buckle, but to me, you know, whenever you're tight, there is a plastic there, more you're tight is putting there some pressure to one point, instead of a smooth strap like this, one point is getting locked there, you know, it's just, yeah. So, but, but,
SPEAKER_00: they will in part, you know they they didn't think that you know it was about the bucket but for me that the plastic that is just more you're tight it's just like putting some. This joint you know they're you know right, but I have another question how much. There is an effect negative way you say, but does it also.
SPEAKER_00: uh bring you down psychologically that oh i'm here when maybe it's causing more than what it is but also another thing of course after round one was so
SPEAKER_03: dominant against uh you said the second round you just wanted to also see what he is yeah yeah sometimes yeah yeah well that's that's reflection afterwards I think to myself did I let down did I did I end up trying to be me be um cute and try to pull like Devon and and pull a little bit more outside and defensively uh after the goal because I because I knew I was on the wrong side of the strap I mean yeah there's I mean yeah
SPEAKER_03: I analyzed it afterwards thinking oh did I did I it was it my brain and head but then again maybe it was just on grab was you know virgali was just spot-on better and just revved up even higher I mean there's a obviously there's so many factors that go and go into it but yeah I know but I I talked I talked with on their way they will say that they won't pull with on their way two three days before
SPEAKER_00: Ongarbe pull against Alex Kurdeca. I was so surprised. You're going to have a match with Alex Kurdeca? That's crazy. That's so crazy. I asked Mazgan. I said, Mazgan, we are friends. How did it go? He said that they were close. Yeah, yeah. Ongarbe and Devon were close. But the interesting thing is that Devon went there as a guest. He didn't go there in a competition mood.
SPEAKER_00: right while on that way i was ready to you know to fight i mean obviously obviously he walks around always ready though if he's he's willing to pull two three days before he's pulling a super match with credential that's crazy that one day we just had like some hours of pulling in germany and then he went to france and trained with all those
SPEAKER_03: you know, Kalinichenko, Prudnik, and some other guys who trained there. I was like, like, how? If I would do six hours, next three weeks, you know, you don't expect anything from me. Yeah, no, no. Looking back, I can remember back the good old days when that was possible for myself. And I think that I was probably my strongest when I was my body responded and I was able to do that. My brother for a while there was pulling almost on a high level on a daily basis. And
SPEAKER_03: It was a little bit of a downward trend initially, but within a few weeks, he was actually seeing his endurance and his strength and ability getting better. But yeah, at our age now, it's impossible. It's impossible. In two or three weeks, I'd be crippled. I'd not be able to push myself out of bed. When you were young, I could do it too. I could do it too. I would just train lifting hours and arm muscle after that.
SPEAKER_00: But now I don't know how he does. I don't know. Maybe the stem cells that he had maybe help him very good. Your stem cell thing is too early for you to say whether or not it's helping or not. The thing is, I feel my knee elbow joint inside and wrist and fingers are better. But here is still pressure because probably they injected more than the capsule can handle.
SPEAKER_00: to my lateral epicondylitis, you know, here. And that is good. After that gets healed up, I will lift. And then he said that, you know, after four months, that healing will continue. It doesn't mean that it will be bad after four months, but the healing will continue till four months and then we will see, you know, like how it will be. But mine wasn't like the others are doing with placenta or something. They took my own fat from my belly.
SPEAKER_02: and then yeah and then they injected they took the stem cells and injected yeah and what was the other other super chat was um from juji and it says john if you had to pull a sibling cough in two weeks can you beat him and would you do well with him right hand left hand
SPEAKER_03: Oh, left-handed at left-hand is easy answer. I get, I get crushed. I get crushed by anybody left-handed right-handed. It all depends on how good Dennis is. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm in arm wrestling form. I mean, I am who I am. It would depend on, on Dennis and.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, just watching some of the matches he's pulling with at the high level guys that he's pulling against. And like I said, I'm comparing how he's been training with Davit, Davit Adam Khan, and how Davit's pulling against some of the top, top guys. I think it'd be as, I think it'd be a lot closer match.
SPEAKER_03: than sitting around waiting for him to get in shape the next four months for sure. So I definitely would rather pull him right now in two weeks and then wait till January, February or whatever they're proposing. Yeah. After you quit for like some weeks and I saw you training with Eric Wolf. Yeah. Yeah. You didn't seem very good.
SPEAKER_00: So there is improvement since that time to this time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. That's what I was wondering. But you will go up to the Petrenko match, probably. Yeah, well, like I said again, to me, it's all about...
SPEAKER_03: having a good you know like devin will say strong frame i mean as long as my every the joints and my inflammation is low and i i feel healed i can mentally go in and and pop and and be and hit hard and and put i mean it's not about ramping up and being that
SPEAKER_03: half a percent stronger because i'm lifting a little bit more i see that all my my curls are you know oh i'm in top shape because i'm that's to me that's never been what's been the key for me for arm wrestling condition um it's more about going in feeling good and feeling healthy so and that's that's the struggle that i've been trying to deal with it's not so much about being bigger and stronger it's about how to keep this freaking
SPEAKER_03: inflammation down. I mean, arthritis, whatever the hell it is, whatever's going on in our, you know, our bodies at this age, I'm trying to, you know,
SPEAKER_03: you know, kill, get rid of it. Because if I push myself too hard and I have that achiness, it can sometimes last for weeks. I mean, so to me, that's more important. Do you think, is there anything that you don't know? No, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I, you know, I've told you before, you know, I've been living on the anti-inflammatory, the assays and I'm prescribed myoxicam and I've tried the
SPEAKER_03: uh naltrexone and you know and you know occasionally i've armed us with you know the day with predisone i mean i've been doing everything that i think that i can you know possibly do to to feel feel healthy but it's still it's still you know it's not it's not 100 i mean if if somebody out there knows you know what's going on chemically inside the human body
SPEAKER_03: at the age that we are that causes this degradation of just feeling sore all the time. How about stem cell that you know? I don't know. Because yeah, stem cell would be the only place I would consider stem cell would be this knotted up
SPEAKER_03: shoulder, this back shoulder of mine that I've been dealing with for years and years and years. And, um, I've actually been, I got reintroduced to talking to some guys that are into the rehab thing. And I've been using the, uh, the racquetball to try to roll it every night. And I've done this in the past and it never seemed to seem to help, but, um, I'm attempting it again to try to try to get everything aligned and, and, and, and, and unknotted, but, um,
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, that would be the only the only thing that I would actually consider stem cell. And and that would be me thinking that my my something is actually torn in there that they haven't saw in the past. I haven't seen in the past. You know, of course, you know, I went in for shoulder surgery. I went and had the MRI done and they really couldn't see. But they went in there anyway. And.
SPEAKER_03: It was six anchors and my labrum was pretty much completely tore out of my arm, but it still never fixed what I went in there for. So sometimes in the back of my mind, I think to myself that the couple of doctors that I've gone to, just they haven't really put the effort to investigate to find it. I know it's there. I know it's there, but no one's found it yet. And when I go back... Can you ask your tapes before trainings?
SPEAKER_00: Because I've never messed with those. I don't know how that would feel. It would help you to not to have maximum pressure there. You know, it would. Right. Right. Well, here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
SPEAKER_03: right here we go back here we go back to the the question how hard would you train what I mean so yes that that train you know that's my weak link when I start pulling really hard and and my shoulder goes click click click click pop up you know then I think oh well that's that's gonna screw me up for weeks now so I mean it's really um yeah I mean but
SPEAKER_03: To me, I mean, I got to do that right to get stronger in the other areas. And I'm hoping that it eventually will strengthen that shoulder. But that seemingly always seems to aggravate it and make it
SPEAKER_03: make it worse. So I don't know where the balance is on that. Maybe supporting it with tape and not putting so much pressure on it, but you know how important that downward elbow to your torso movement is. I mean, it supports everything. It's what makes the stability in your hand and wrist, even with the side pressure.
SPEAKER_03: And that's not there. It's just it's it's a whole different ballgame of trying to control somebody and bring somebody down, you know, to the without without it. So but my my struggle shoulders. But I think that's building up here. I don't want these guys to start yelling at me. So I'm going to ask a couple of them. Lavon's liver is back with another question he wants to know. Back in 2006, when you were in your prime,
SPEAKER_03: Did anybody give you a hard time in practice? I trained with a pretty good group back then. I'm trying to remember 2006 where I was at, but I had some really great training partners and a really solid big team in Utah. Fresh for fresh with a tournament situation or ready to go, I would blow all the guys out of the water.
SPEAKER_03: When it's when it's practice and you're purposely pulling slower or easing into it and creating a pump and getting the work. I mean, a bunch of high school kids, 2010 high school kids could give you a good workout. So, yes, there was people that were.
SPEAKER_03: giving me good work back in 2006, but on a, on a fresh for fresh ready go, I was, I was, yeah, there wasn't too many people at that point that was, was, were messing with me. It's nice to see that my, my top competition, Farid Usmanov at that, that day back in 06, 07 was, is, is still doing really well to this day. So it makes me think, okay, well, yeah, we're,
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, arm wrestling wasn't at such a low, wasn't such a low level back in 2006. When you pull Patrick, he will be there. Oh, okay. Yeah. He will be coming as a visitor. Yeah. You got, you got a lot of big, you got a lot of big stars coming, uh, for this next one, which I, yeah. And then it's all, these are not pulling, but they will be there, you know? Yeah. I'm wrestling with those guests, honestly.
SPEAKER_00: I want to be grateful to people, you understand? I want to feel like a family. That's how it is. The whole world knows that you are, Engin. I'm telling you, everybody knows. I invited Devon too, but he wasn't available. If Devon would come also, ah, come on. Right.
SPEAKER_03: weights of the greatness in the building would be right right right right i'm surprised i'm surprised that he doesn't he doesn't figure that that would be something that would be beneficial for him as far as his uh his followers and the youtube thing i mean it's got to be a money maker for him he said he's going to come in january okay we will talk a little bit more you know
SPEAKER_03: Okay, what's the other question? Sorry about that. The next one is from Armwrestling Hooker. He wants to know, are John and Devon going to have a practice soon? We are practicing on Monday at noon. And Devon's documentary team is going to be here tomorrow. And they're spending a little bit of time with me just by myself tomorrow.
SPEAKER_03: but they would have to release that footage. So don't expect, I can't, they promised me to tell everybody that's gonna be at the practice, no video, no taping, no iPhones. So there's not gonna be probably any footage of it unless they say it's okay.
SPEAKER_03: um to leak whatever out but yes we are all pulling uh on monday at noon uh devin's coming out um travis badgent's gonna be here um brandon allen um the guys that i pull with eric uh dustin uh and a few other local guys so should be a pretty solid practice hell yeah that sounds awesome i'll look forward to that footage that's going to be amazing when it comes out i don't blame them for telling everybody not to film it
SPEAKER_02: it's going to be like millions of years I have a question for you John you are training partner of Jerry do you see him stronger than other shape yeah he's stronger than he was uh when he pulled Gennady for sure absolutely yeah he's been straight through the whole time and I mean it's kind of hard for us to tell because he's you know he's a lot better than everybody up here honestly
SPEAKER_02: But you can still like, you know, we can watch how fast he breaks down in practices. And like, for example, the last big practice we did with Gennady after about, let's say, 45 minutes in, he started to be beatable by some of us. And then this one we did a few weeks ago, at the end of the practice, he was still crushing everybody. And it was the same group of people. We had a lot of people just beating him up. And his endurance is significantly better. And I think his overall strength level is better, too.
SPEAKER_03: That other one is more important. Endurance, the endurance game is the favorite for sure. Is his cardio based on just arm wrestling a lot for a lengthy period of time or is he doing any like road work or bicycling or anything like that? I actually, I talked to him about, a few of us have talked to him about that, John, because, you know, he tends to get big with all those chicken wing eating contests and everything.
SPEAKER_02: I was like losing 15 or 20 pounds. It's not functional weight that he's losing. So it's going to help him in terms of like his blood flow in the event. So he did actually drop.
SPEAKER_02: uh like I think 25 pounds training for Gennady and I think he was he had a gold weight in mind for armies which is a little bit loader lower than that okay right you know it's basically he's just he's trying to eat a little bit smarter and he's training more so I think right right right right because I I was I was I was stage side when he his first match with Gennady and it looked like he he definitely needed some help and some oxygen because he was he was uh
SPEAKER_02: Not only just looking tired, he was looking like, I can't get enough air in my system at all to even stay alive. It's scary sometimes watching him pull, to be honest with you. I think it's something that a lot of us talk to him about. People have to do things their own way, as you know. Right. A couple more Super Chats, a whole bunch of them now. This is from Jarvis Wilson. John, you utilized a super fast shoulder press against Dennis in one of your matches. Do you still have that transition to flop press?
SPEAKER_03: uh I still have it um the only reason it was effective against Devon or Devon Dennis um at that particular moment it was that he was completely blown up to the point where he couldn't function at all so I was just kind of showing off just you know it wasn't something that you know I needed to do um but yeah no I still have kind of I have a shoulder press um um but yeah I don't expect that I would use it and I have a question
SPEAKER_00: just one second if like how much uh petrenko match is important before the dennis match would it affect you in a negative or positive way you know the results of that match no
SPEAKER_03: Justin say that if you would lose to. No, I'm hoping it won't affect them in a positive or negative. That's more important to me than how it's going to affect me. I pretty much would say yes.
SPEAKER_03: know if i was 80 years old to pull dennis if they asked me to pull dennis i mean i'm it's not it's not about my yeah i mean i'm gonna give it my full legendary match i'm gonna yeah i'm gonna say yes no matter what what kind of shape i think i am in or what my chances if it's a million to one i i still would say well you know i still got a chance i would still say yes well to gauge yourself the trinco match is more of a challenge
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yeah. Petrenko, I expect, will be just as high a level as Angrabaya. If it could swing either way for myself, I could be super, you know, or, I mean, that's the thing with arm wrestling. I mean, you can be that...
SPEAKER_03: one hundredth of a percent equal and it could look horrible and um the only you know only the two competitors know how close and afterwards one percent or less than one percent is just going there and if it comes in your way and then the rest is very easy as you say yeah exactly but um yeah I was gonna I had another thought but now it's my old age I forgot what I was gonna say
SPEAKER_03: but oh back to back to dennis i mean i'm hoping that i mean i don't even know i mean it's funny like i said the with their their confidence level of we're not sure if he's going to be 100 or we got to make sure that you know he's able to i'm like okay well what kind of version do they really want of me i mean do they want me smashing people and being like like i'm you know level of the highest level or do they want you know sacrificial
SPEAKER_03: I just, I don't know what's going through their head. I mean, what kind of person do they want me to, you know, they want me to show up in destroy mode or do they want me to show up in, oh, this is a little teaser match for Dennis on his first comeback I made. So I'll accommodate either. I do have to.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think that your opponent is going to tell you. My point is, if I smash Petrenko, which I'm just saying what if, possibly, I just mow through him and like, is that going to make them go, well, maybe Dennis isn't ready yet. Maybe we'll...
SPEAKER_03: wait another year there no no no no they're still going to want it so they probably want to see me be I mean maybe they will not want to pull you if you lose Petrenko but no that's and that's that's the other side of it too like okay well are they going to just dismiss me as being really weak my opinion no matter what the result of Petrenko versus John right jumpers Inc versus Dennis match
SPEAKER_00: It doesn't matter. There is nothing that can affect this as long as you guys are able to train and get ready. Right. I mean, that match is just like a very big match, you know. Right. Very big match, yeah, in any ways. Agreed. Yeah, because after Petrenko, was it three weeks, four weeks, three, four short weeks after that, I'm facing Michael Todd. So, I mean, I...
SPEAKER_00: I could be a three-time loser here shortly. Michael is not going to come there 100% either. Michael is going to be 100%. Michael is the best version of Michael. I don't know what kind of war he's going to have with Prudnik. We don't know. He recovers better than you do. That's what you're saying. Excuse me? He recovers better than you do.
SPEAKER_03: oh yeah i think jim wise he's definitely 10 times better shape than i am as far as um you know he's got 10 years on me so he's got the youth factor but yeah he's definitely i'm sure he'll bounce back you know i think he's i think that's all that's going to improve for him too because he's a little bit lighter you know his commitment to being in shape versus as big as he could be i think that's going to help too yeah no i think so too i think he's better than the the hardly breathing you know just
SPEAKER_03: 290 pounds yeah this one is looking very healthy very athletic and he can do all kind of things i think his endurance will be there his speed will be there you know yeah yeah i agree i agree his his frames his frame's not big enough to be you know levon no matter what he does so it's it's i think it's it's a better choice to stay in the light heavyweights i'm just thinking that uh there's only three of us on this show and i think
SPEAKER_02: We still have 150 years between the three of us. But speaking of old guys, another question from Macadonic111 says, what is John's opinion on Engin versus Devon at 100 kilos? He says he thinks Engin could surprise and cost him. John, not the 90 kilo Engin, but just like. Yeah, 100 kilo?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't go to that match, you know, like how I am, you know, just I would go there. You can imagine how I would go there, you know. Yeah, I mean, if I'm honest, I don't know. I mean, I don't, I don't, I've never, I mean, last time I experienced your hit was when you were 150 pounds in Reno back probably 30 years ago. So
SPEAKER_03: I mean, if you tell me you can get to the point where you've got, get that old explosiveness back, I mean, that's Devon's weakness. I mean, Devon can be exposed. We've yet to see how Devon...
SPEAKER_00: is able to handle guys like our similar way of uh the super explosive arm wrestlers I mean that's the way to be yeah yeah the only way to beat him yeah yeah he's gonna he's gonna beat you he's gonna beat you so if he stops you he's gonna beat you yeah so but 100 kilo Devon I just do not know like the Devon at the Y shape he's still gonna be super strong super strong yes but he is not like
SPEAKER_00: unbeatable you know like there is some people in 100 kilo versus wild shape of Devon in the world they could could cause problems I think at 100 kilos yeah I don't hurt kills Devon's gonna still have the great endurance probably even better than he does that 120 if you are pulling Devon you you shouldn't worry about his endurance right you should worry about his explosive power right right yeah
SPEAKER_03: No, I agree. It'd be interesting to see Devon at 105, 110, or whatever size he wants to get down to. I think it's way better for him for super matches. There are going to be a ton more matches that people are going to want to see that are way more interesting than him staying in the heavies. I mean, he still should dabble in the super heavyweights, obviously. A lot of people would love to see how he would do against Gennady and
SPEAKER_03: and all the all the big guys yeah everybody except lebanon but um yeah yeah he's yeah he's got definitely a lot of options uh what do you think how do you see that uh
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think I've got a lot of chances that I wasn't able to utilize the last time we pulled. Obviously, I feel like without the strap, it just depends on a lot of factors, the rule set,
SPEAKER_03: referees the situation um i mean i would love to still have i would still love to be in a class at devon's in a regular arm wrestling event that's that has uh double elimination i think i'd be so much more effective to win the tournament than devon would be because at 230 because
SPEAKER_03: he typically is going to be in, you know, some tougher matches or endurance matches where I would be pop, pop, pop, pop. So, I mean, obviously the situation would be a lot better for me in that situation to be able to have one match and then sit down and rest for 20 minutes instead of having to arm wrestle again in a minute. But yeah, no, in a six round super match, it's still tough with Devon, but just because he's so... Five rounds, five rounds.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so even if I felt like I could pop a match out of them, you know, one match, two matches, three is tough, four is tough, or five, you know, so it's tough. You need to have this set up as quick as possible. Yeah, no, I don't feel like he would just crush me like he did in Dubai, I mean, and just shut me completely down from match one. I think I have enough...
SPEAKER_03: still left in me to, you know, to make that questionable. And, you know, it just depends on how that match would end. The first match, the second match, obviously, you know,
SPEAKER_00: But yeah, it wouldn't be a cakewalk, I don't think, but I'm sorry. He says he's going to, he would crush you. Crush me, right. Yeah, I see. I heard what, I heard the crushing. Yeah, yeah. He said to Rymond, and he asked Rymond, what do you think? And he said, I think John would beat you. He said, like, really? Really? Yeah. He asked, like, really, really? And then whenever something is surprising to Ermes, Ermes says, Sirius, are you Sirius?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. One is from Kazzy and it says to John, if you have shoulder pain, try not to sleep on your shoulder. It's gotten to the point where my left shoulder hurts as much as my right one. Well, not as much as my right one, but it hurts enough where I roll over a
SPEAKER_03: a hundred times throughout the night. I mean, I'm just, I can't sleep on my back. I'm a side sleeper and it's just, I, I need to investigate and maybe try to find some special arrangement or pillow or something that could prop my arm up a little bit better, but yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah you know when you get older you are like after the point you are thinking that you know I mean it's not worse I'm gonna say yeah sleep is still more important to me than than damaging or making my shoulder hurt I still gotta and then uh the HF razor says Legends keep pulling and don't worry about winning yeah
SPEAKER_03: No, I mean, yeah, I think I've accepted the role of being the old guy that a lot of young gunslingers want to test themselves on. And, you know, I'm willing to accept that role for the next, you know, five, six, seven, I don't know, maybe even 10 years. So, yeah, win or lose. I like to be thought of as the gauge of success.
SPEAKER_00: gatekeeper of excellence so we'll see see how long i can i can maintain that we'll lose a lot you know once you stop pulling you know just while they can still see it it is good you know even you are limited don't get me wrong when i said limited because of your injuries you can't do everything you could when you were young correct right right yeah but yeah yeah but i can still put up a decent fight yeah yes yes yes yes this one your limited version is better than
SPEAKER_00: rest of us it's competitive at least still competitive i mean about the the arm resting ability and quality i'm talking about you win you lose a different thing you know that but the way that you play the way that you're doing transition the way that you know you have um ability to generate finishing power in almost any position which is incredible you know well thank you there is no no hand position that you are put
SPEAKER_00: that you can't apply pressure to the pimpet especially shoulder back shoulder i remember you taught us put you everything out like this all right all right right you know like we were like what the hell is it how how can that be yeah we were like that's probably what screwed my shoulder up yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. That, that is why you are, you are, because you were 90 maximum, a hundred kilo guy, all your life pull against those monsters. I remember in us when there is enough money, you were pulling 90, a hundred over or whatever, you know, fully many categories. So all that puts so much pressure. And do you agree that the shoulder is the late career injury? Like the early career is that this inner elbow, elbow, elbow, right. Develop here.
SPEAKER_03: And then this is coming the latest in my opinion and experience. Yeah, but when I really analyze it, I mean, I think that that area is definitely an indicator of a good armrest. I mean, I look at the biops and it's funny how as you get older, you start to realize, oh, okay, the structure of that lat and that shoulder is actually...
SPEAKER_03: way more of a key indicator of, uh, potential great greatness than, than, you know, the biceps or the pushing or the triceps. Um, it's, it's such a, you know, obviously once it's hurt, you realize, oh, wow, I really use that a lot. That's definitely a super important, super important muscle to have that for, to be effective at arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_02: yeah once it gets broken you you you realize the absence of it and then you yeah I wish I wish I knew how to strengthen it without irritating it I yeah but I I haven't figured that out yet billionaire what's that I said if anybody had figured that out they'd be a billionaire because right interesting question
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there's another question. I was just saying, I think you're right about how much interest is seeing Dennis versus John because most of these questions have been about it. This one's from trailblazer. What is it? Trailblazer82 says, John, did the thickness of Dennis's hand cause you any issues in your last match?
SPEAKER_03: No, because the thickness, he didn't have any, he couldn't really close his hand because it was so thick that he couldn't really control the back of my hand. So I felt somewhat comfortable with Dennis just because I knew I could put my hand and get my hand in a cup position to apply maximum pressure. He wasn't so swallowing that he could turn me over.
SPEAKER_03: The only, his hand was obviously strong and thick, but it wasn't long enough and coupleable, you know. So, but he's realized that he can just kind of pronate almost with his hand open now and be way more effective than what he was trying to do. But yeah, no, it didn't affect me as much as someone like Devon's hand does or some of these, you know, mass hands that are more,
SPEAKER_03: um you don't like the people they are more gain going away and with heights you know just like like travis or man yeah yeah well yeah those are different strengths that i've hated also in my career because i'd like to be able to have the hand control to pronate into their into their hand and those guys that have the high posting top rolls
SPEAKER_03: uh make that difficult off the go you almost have to change your strategy of almost trying to hook to get them at an angle before you apply that pressure so it's kind of a timing thing more of a speed thing and it makes you vulnerable to getting top rolled if it doesn't if you can't control it to the hook first uh but yeah guys that are
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, posting with a longer fingered hand, stronger hand than Dennis is. Dennis pretty much in our last match gave me every opportunity to apply maximum effort to roll his hand out.
SPEAKER_00: yeah as thick as it was it wasn't somehow not other people could find that that opportunity with him even in those years that you said he wasn't experienced yeah yeah there's another question from uh lasia who says who are john's current favorite pullers to watch oh that's one
SPEAKER_03: maybe put a prudnik one maybe um yeah prudnik's kind of boring though i mean he's just so dominant it makes it look so easy uh what can he do if he's so good yeah he's so good that it's just not it's not fun um and boy i hate to jump on the bandwagon of of the
SPEAKER_03: of all the fighting and arguments that i'm going to get from saying something like you know uh jerry catarat or monster michael todd but yeah i mean i like i like watching these crazy uh
SPEAKER_03: unorthodox, horrible positions that people are just fighting, fighting through with every last bit of energy they have. I mean, it's definitely more enjoyable to me than watching even just a smooth, you know, you know,
SPEAKER_03: effective great technique match so um yeah boring as well then because i thought during your career you were yeah i i i would i would hate watching myself i mean i think i'm the most probably most boring arm wrestler on the planet
SPEAKER_03: Because most of my matches, I'm not the endurance guy. I don't have the long, drawn-out, hard-fought, blood, sweat, and tears match that some of these other guys do. And I think most of the public likes the drama that goes along with these two, three, four, ten-minute matches. I mean, the Dave Chaffee, you know, Batali match. Yeah, I mean, who doesn't love that? I mean, so...
SPEAKER_03: any match that's a hard fought match and it's just it's it's hard with arm wrestling arm wrestling the the rule set is such that it's normally pretty decisive right one way or the other i mean it's if you get the last 30 years or 40 years 40 years i should say who is the who has been the most famous boxer in the last 40 years from 1980 to today
SPEAKER_03: well to me it was always Mike Tyson and he's what kind of boxer he was yeah yeah yeah explosive just knock knock your butt out you know different things to see that yeah yeah dominant people they see like a Superman you know I'm touching right right yeah it's true yeah very true I don't know I think more people get inspired by watching two guys really leave it all on the table and gutting it out though than they do just watching someone be so dominant in
SPEAKER_03: don't know to me i don't know i understand and how do you see britney versus michael people says that it is like mismatch very easy match for prudnik this do you agree with it no no i think i think michael's the fate in my mind michael's going in as probably the favorite uh again he's gotta just do everything right and i'm not sure if gany's
SPEAKER_03: ever been put in the position to, you know, to really think about what's going to happen to him. I think Evgeny is going to be a lot more effective against Michael the next time they pull. I think this is going to be a learning experience for him. I think, yeah, he might end up... He cannot dominate him? I don't think he's going to dominate him, no. I don't think... Yeah, this is what I was asking. Who did dominate Michael? I mean...
SPEAKER_03: in last some years you know like who dominated him yeah yeah i think i think again he's probably yeah he's probably going to be the most i mean hand wrist solid cupping ability other than lelan i think
SPEAKER_03: Evgeny is the second best at probably doing all those things, but as good and as strong as even Dave Chaffee is with that move, and he has a difficult time with Mike. So it will all be told how much effort Evgeny – I mean, if he's –
SPEAKER_03: strong enough in the hand of wrists and the cup to be able to really put mike out of position and beat him quick i mean i could see the match going quick for evgeny but i i i see michael being able to stop it and then then it's going to be how smart is it again hey is he does he have we ever seen evgeny do a shoulder roll never ever shoulder roll when you are so dominant technically
SPEAKER_00: that is the problem because you are so dominant in technical you always get the match in your way because you are you have so super control but once you meet someone like michael and somehow if he puts you in a unorthodox arm wrestling then there the trouble starts because you are not used to
SPEAKER_03: Right. Right. Because you like to control the pronator, do this. Right. Yeah. And I'm not. Yes. But if he's not that strong, he may be in trouble. Right. Well, and the problem is, even if he is that strong to get that position, if he can't quite finish, is he going to be smart enough to go, okay, center position, just hold, maintain, let my opponent wear him out, wear himself out just as much as I'm wearing myself out? Or is he going to be a push car of just...
SPEAKER_03: hard or hard and just and just burning himself out by trying to win with what he feels is the the best possible way i mean so i think evgeny is strong enough to get the cup get the position on mike and not have the arm strength to finish but he's going to have to be smart enough to okay set back to center just maintain this position climb a little bit if i have to maintain be very patient be very patient
SPEAKER_03: count to 20 count to 30 and then maybe hit again and then if that doesn't work then commit to the commit to a press i mean at some point i think the match is going to have to be won with a press um and i i don't know i don't know if that's in his brain to have that the reason the reason i'm laughing when you're talking because you're gonna pull michael three weeks
SPEAKER_03: and you are telling us exactly what he knows exactly what i will try to do he knows i i in my mind there's only one key that will unlock michael and it has to be performed perfectly for me i mean it's it's it's a tough challenge but and i think prudnik is definitely way more capable than i will be it's whether or not he has mentally gone through it in his head to to to deduce
SPEAKER_00: and if if we if we just quickly just uh predict the matches quickly and then we can finish we don't want to keep you so long and also josh um like you say that michael rudnick if you go by percentage you would say like 50 50 or it's just john
SPEAKER_00: Oh, me? You're asking me? I'm going to go, I'll go 60-40, Michael. Wow. And you, John? I agree. You agree? Wow. I mean, I... He's down like 70, 30, 80, 20. You know, Michael is underdog on the social media. To me, he looks very close, yeah. Yeah. And you saw...
SPEAKER_03: Sorry, sorry, go ahead. Go ahead. No. So, yeah, I mean, I see Evgeny, even if he explosively is able to control and pop Michael the first match, second match, I still think Michael has a chance to win the best of five. It was going to be some point in that super match that Evgeny is going to have to do the right things technically to win.
SPEAKER_03: it's not going to be about his strength his power is absolutely and and John versus Petrenko come on don't be yeah I I'm gonna I'm gonna say he's probably gonna I I don't know he's gonna be just as good as uh uh so I'm gonna say 50 50. I'm I'm feeling like it's gonna be
SPEAKER_03: Also, you're not healed this time. You're not healed this time. You're healthy. Oh, yeah. No, I'm healed. I don't have any cold or cough or respiratory issues. But I'm not sure that made any difference with Unger Bio. Unger Bio was just, yeah, just that I left that match thinking, oh, man, I screwed up pulling just way too hard in that second match when I got put out of position. And that ruined me. I got to be smarter. It's hard to.
SPEAKER_00: know it's easy afterwards but you get caught up in thinking you don't want to say as an excuse but only two days before you come here you said you almost called me and saying and i'm not coming and so i know you cannot say if you say these people say oh excuse this but i i know you told me that
SPEAKER_00: you know i had fever and i almost told you i couldn't get up from the bed i am sure that i'm not saying that ongar bear won fairs but you know if we touch it like not as the from the perspective of the john but with an objective eyes there was a condition like and you had yeah
SPEAKER_03: I don't, it's more to me, arm wrestling is about more, I mean, yes, you need to be strong, but that wasn't a factor as much as just the situation, the timing and just letting, you know, it was a mental failure more than a physical failure for me.
SPEAKER_03: to me. I mean, I didn't, I didn't feel like, Oh, I'm trained. I'm more on. I felt like I still had the strength and power to put up, you know, just as normal. And sometimes I, sometimes in the past, I think, you know, like I said, I've performed actually better when I've just healed and not in any kind of good shape or even being a little sick. I mean, uh, so it's, it's not, it's not as big a factor as just the way things happen and, and how you respond to them during, during the match. And it's,
SPEAKER_03: It can mess you up so much worse in a super match if you don't respond correctly and do the right things because you don't have 20 minutes or an hour to go back and sit at your seat and think about it and completely recoup. Something will change when you meet him again? I'm super excited to pull him again. I would love to pull him again. The first time, I didn't know where I stood against him. Like I told you before,
SPEAKER_03: Igor proposed it to me with the top eight. I thought to myself, well, I'm just too out of it. I won't be able to compete with those other seven guys. But now I feel like I could still be competitive. So, yeah, I look very much forward to a rematch with Kregali. Yeah, I will ask whenever you want. And how do you see this, John? I think John has an edge because of the hand fighting.
SPEAKER_02: Justin because I've seen Oleg get his hand taken a few times and end up pressing, I feel like that's a window for John that he didn't have with Ongarbaev. So I think I'm in favor of John on that one. I understand. And Ermes Gasparini versus Artem Taino. No, Artem Taino. Artem Morozov, left arm. After that King of the Table match a couple weeks ago, I think
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to go with Morozov on that one. Morozov. And you, John? I'll stick with my boy, Ermes. I think he's going to be able to pop him. Yeah. But if it gets stopped, then Ermes will be done. But it depends on the position, too. Yeah, of course. And Jerry versus Ermes?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think Jerry's going to win. I mean, I, my only concern, as I mentioned earlier is the fight is if he keeps his elbow on the pad. I think if he does, I think army is, I just, we've seen the best top roles in the world, try to beat Jerry and fail in the past. And I know armies is a very different person and he's got different skills, but I still, until somebody, a top roller beats Jerry, I'm going to, I'm going to keep picking them. Right.
SPEAKER_03: i think it's a 50 50 match also i i well ermy's is getting gotten bigger and gotten stronger and i've seen him when he's been a little guy he will commit with pushing and and going sideways with the shoulder when he pulled michael todd back way back when so i know he's capable and he has the arm strength and the ability to uh
SPEAKER_03: have a lot more side pressure than most great top rollers do so uh but ermy's just got to be able to be smart i mean he can't he's got to rely on his side pressure and his arm strength more than his um than his top roll so and if he does that i think ermy's probably has a little bit of an edge but it's i think it's going to be another learning experience for hermes
SPEAKER_03: everybody that pulls jerry walks away going okay all right now i know and now i see and then and then can refigure but yeah and and revas versus morozov how do you see that much john do you see this you think it may be a good match or oh yeah they're both i mean that's a battle of the hands right i mean yeah but what he can also he has also hooked the ability morozov has the plus
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Morozov can book a top role, but while Ravas is mostly outside, yeah. Yeah. To be able to stop Dave Chaffee like Morozov did, I think that, you know, that's super impressive in my mind. Ravas, I don't know. I don't have much experience with him. But he looks like he's got an incredible top role. But I don't even know. Two big, strong guys seemingly having the same strengths should be fun.
SPEAKER_00: And the only thing is about that match, Morozov have been at top and pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing. While Revaz was away since 2018, Moldova event that you competed. And almost three and a half years he was away. And then only two months,
SPEAKER_00: I called him, and he was not training. In two months, he trained. He pulled with Michael. And then he trained a little bit more, two and a half months more. There was two and a half months between East versus West, three and four. And then he beat Derek. And now he has another three and a half months. I think that because of his size and structure, he has something more to go than Morozov. Morozov is going to, but Morozov is already pushing. He's going tiny bit, tiny bit, tiny bit.
SPEAKER_00: while the other guy just started. And he has never been at his best because he never took arm wrestling that seriously. But he said now he has a dream to beat Levan. Right, right. I don't think either one of them, I think, I hate to say it like this, but I think that match will be
SPEAKER_03: Neither one of them have much of a defensive. I see that match as being boring one way or the other. It's going to be boom or boom, right? As soon as one guy gets the better position with the hand and wrist, they're going to be strong enough to beat the other guy.
SPEAKER_00: Sometimes, you know, if it's boring or not, some matches needs to happen for the rankings. Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. It's still exciting to see what happens after that go. Yeah, yeah. Like Devon versus Devon, technically, it was not also so exciting match. But we had to see it. We had to see what's going to happen there. So that is. And how you see that match, John? I think what John said earlier, I mean, what happened with Chaffee,
SPEAKER_02: is the answer for me. I just can't pick against him now because that was so impressive to me. And plus, I mean, just he's such a resilient puller that I feel like he's emerging and he's getting better and better to reframe what you just said as well and again. So I'm definitely picking Morozov on that one. And let me add in a comment from Arun Prasad. He said, John's match with Corey was exciting to watch for everyone. It was a long fought war and he had a lot of fun watching it. Justin a comment on that.
SPEAKER_00: Thanks. I waited till 4 a.m. to wash here, you know. And then the next thing I was like, you know, Ermes is sending me a WhatsApp message. Did you see that? Did you see it like 4 a.m.? John's good. Did you see what he did? I'd like to pull Corey again. That was enough fun for me to do it again. We'll see if that's in the cards for me. Justin don't get hurt. I like Corey. Shoulders.
SPEAKER_02: There's one more paid question here. I'm going to ask it, but you don't have to answer it if you don't want to. It's again from Devon's Liver. Who are the top three cheaters in arm wrestling right now?
SPEAKER_03: Cheaters, I mean, how are we defining cheaters? Someone that exposes the rules to their fullest without being caught, that's the cheater. Then I'm going to put, you know, the guys that are so obsessed with the sport, like, yeah, Devon's got to be on the top of the list. He's not a cheater, but he's, I mean, is there a guy out there other than yourself, Inga, that has analyzed and spent the time and hours and effort looking at every little aspect? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: i i analyzed to how to win but he analyzed how to yeah super super deep thought thought there that that yeah so i'm gonna put devin as probably the most deep thinker slash cheater just say you know best analyzer of the sport for you the prudny prudnik versus matt mask did you watch that match like closely later or something
SPEAKER_00: um yeah i just got caught up in the dds did you like like i didn't watch it was just so big you know argument you know but like i asked the referee christo from bulgaria i said like was he was prudnik really cheating you know
SPEAKER_00: And when I say cheating, you know, it does not like cheating, but it was he really like doing things that, you know, Matt was saying, you know, he said, yeah, right. And so, so he asked to, he asked to put it in, you know, like why you were even stronger, you know, why you needed to do that. Because after the round three, when Brittany won quickly, and then
SPEAKER_00: Matt asking brother, like you, you are clearly stronger. So why you did that? You know, all this. Right. Right. It is to ask to, um, uh, Prudnik and Prudnik said that, you know, he didn't have very good preparation. And after he lost against Tobias with left arm, so he was kind of a little bit, you know, I cannot say really cheating, but he was just like,
SPEAKER_03: using his house like same as that one you know using it right yeah yeah yeah fullest fullest abilities every option available to make the match get over with me yes people people approach matches differently though right i mean some guys
SPEAKER_03: they feel like they're super strong will want to give a little away and test and and you know give you know give the competitor a chance that others are just still completely frightened to death and scared maybe it's a sign of respect i think that that prudnik had of matt feeling like matt could have possibly popped him if he let down even in the slightest so i mean i i don't know he didn't take a risk
SPEAKER_03: he didn't take a chance so he didn't want to didn't want to take the chance yeah and to me it doesn't hardly make any sense just for me personally the position you know in the situation with super match i mean it's different if if it's an open tournament and there is a semi-truck to be won then your then your mindset is cheat as much as i could cheat to get rid of this field of people you know but if it's if it's a super match and you're wanting to test your yourself and your all your your abilities and
SPEAKER_03: and you want to you know allow your opponent to test his abilities and it's a it's uh i mean and there's nothing to be won uh it's it's i don't know to me it's a different approach i mean i would i would definitely compare then devon and travis with each other um
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, well, Travis does what he does because of his capabilities. I mean, Travis needs to be the way he is before the go because he's all about being super explosive. Bang. Yeah, the start. So, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Devon, on the other hand, is... Devon does the same thing just to catch the guy. He's doing the opposite just to not get the great start, but he's doing it just to... Not to get flushed. Piss the opponent off and get him all worked up and riled up because he's sucking the energy out of him. Yeah. Imagine, you know, Devon is pulling. When they are pulling, they're getting gripped
SPEAKER_03: and things will be interesting to see yeah but yeah Travis doesn't want to spend a lot of time on the setup if he if he had his way because he's he's you know he's a explosive you know pop hitter he doesn't want to you know show you anything until after the goal so I'm completely different completely different set of saying that Neil pickup calls it the tricky bastard scale
SPEAKER_03: The tricky bastard scale, yeah. It's not a negative to be on that list. To me, it's... Well, it's Devon. Everybody's a bunch of comments. Travis, Devon, Devon Underwood is one that's shown up. Nobody's mentioned Mason Vale, but he was definitely high on the list up here in the Northeast. Yeah. Dave Patton. Cheating, cheating, cheater, cheater, cheater. Because
SPEAKER_03: He just never, he would, I mean, he could be arm wrestling a sixth grade school kid and he would not allow, like I would say, Dave, I mean, you're,
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. He just didn't have the confidence in his abilities to even try to, you know, let out a little rope for the poor guy to see, you know, to test himself and allow the other guy to test himself. So, yeah. So, yeah, Dave was definitely probably giving Devon some competition because there was just no room for anybody. Dave came to the table giving it his 100% best no matter who you were.
SPEAKER_03: some people thought that was you know that just was not sportsmanlike and cheating and you know you know give the poor guy a chance i mean he's just a school kid but nope dave would hammer him wow yeah um john uh sundries versus matt mask i don't know how good sandras is i mean i hear the name all the time i've seen him a few times he's big and posing but um yeah um
SPEAKER_00: chance was better in hook and chance was better in uh before the match we expected the opposite way right right right yeah but we thought that you know sundries was gonna try to hook him or something but it's the opposite way
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah Matt Matt's definitely not as strong as chances I think in a armed arm I mean Matt's a little bit better with the height and the hand strength but I'm not sure what kind of if if Matt's arm side side pressure would hold up to Sandris so it's how did you how did you think you know like when when you saw Krasimir in the mad mask did you think that it was as dominant as Iraqis win against Krasimir
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. Repeat that question. Krazy and Arekli. Yeah, you saw the Matt Mask versus Krazy, right? Yeah, Krazy. I don't know where Krazy's at, though. I mean, Krazy's, yeah, I mean, it's hard to gauge not knowing when the one-sided verbal that we put at such a high level two, three years ago is now getting beat decisively by guys that you think, oh, I mean...
SPEAKER_03: We put Vitaly at number two in the world just because of his match with Krazy, how dominant he was, and to be able to play with him in a hook. And it was like, okay, but nobody took into consideration that Krazy is not the same Krazy as we remember him. So, yeah, hard to say, but both of them were probably the same Krazy. And the thing is, when you saw Dave Chaffee versus Laletin match,
SPEAKER_00: and did you think that is there is there any possibility that jerry gennady morozo and say uh these guys are now uh close to that that where we thought that la latin is of course of course anything can happen in there right yeah of course of course especially when you saw ferret beating no yeah yeah no yeah that's yeah definitely definitely that
SPEAKER_03: How do you think he's going to go? From what I saw of Mr. Usmanov in Russia, I think he's well-rounded enough to beat Gennady. I think he's not only got the top role advantage, but he also possesses, obviously, the inside move to finish it once he gets that hand advantage. But, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It goes wrist to wrist, and Gennady somehow is able to keep it wrist to wrist, and it's a war. If they both go outside, I think Ferit is going to top. Ferit is stronger. I think it's a stronger hand, yes. This is solid, yeah. By the way, Ruslan Babaev is also coming in January to East vs. West. Oh, cool. Who are you going to put him up against? Is he going to pull? I don't know if I should say the name because he has a match, then after that match. Okay, I will tell you.
SPEAKER_00: he wins or if he doesn't win i don't know if pauline beats uh but rustam is not rustam is not trained okay he's coming back you understand he is he just started right he will have like three months or something preparation and do you think that he versus pauline 95 kilo anything or uh it depends on rustam i mean rustam is
SPEAKER_00: i mean he goes through todd hutchins so pauline's gonna have to be like but don't you think that pauline is more explosive to get a position than touchings i'm not talking about strength but you know you said that you yeah did you hook paul did you allow him or he poked you and you said no yeah yeah so yeah the question is the question is uh todd hutchins probably has way more side pressure than pauline
SPEAKER_03: uh hooking ability on his side of the table but Paul Linn might have a better bicep to be able to stop that that downward pressure that that Rustem puts on people which exposes Todd Hutchins I mean Todd obviously seemingly has a problem with people really pulling hard on his bicep
SPEAKER_03: So, yeah, I mean, I'm not going to count Paul N out, but that's a tall order for Paul N. I mean, that's jumping right to the top of the mountain there, right? Where does he go if he beats Rustem? I think you're good. Arsene was going to come back, but Arsene now was one of the guys that may be called to army in Russia.
SPEAKER_00: And I asked him, are you still training? He said, we are waiting. Maybe they will call us to army. And he said that he is not motivated. But if he's not called, then hopefully, you know, the match that I wanted to see would never happen. Ruslan Babae versus Arsene Lillia.
SPEAKER_00: that right that must never happen you know that right right yeah I was there I was there when his brother Ruslan pulled him and that was a great match but that was when arson was a little 165 70 pounds yeah and the last match I will ask you is you saw the lately Ryan Bowen Ryan after he lost against uh Ray he went to England he gained weight
SPEAKER_00: And he beat Bogdan Stojko. Bogdan Stojko is not joke. Bogdan Stojko is not like elite level, but he's not a joke. You know, he could be around top five if he's good internationally. Right. So he beat him. And then I don't really judge anything about his win against Halit.
SPEAKER_00: now he said he will be about hundred five hundred seven kilo you know whenever i said chance show versus uh zurab match people like are you crazy like zurab is gonna kill him and like what are you doing i said no no no no i mean you may top roll chance but even even touching said problem to beat the guy even doesn't give his tornadoes
SPEAKER_00: like this and i said the style that i see zurab is giving his pronator to hook and then the style that i see that once chance has his wrist fully flexed the guy is very dangerous right i think if i know about arm wrestling i don't know who's gonna win but i said you know that is not gonna be easy match and then chance one three zero i'm not saying that ryan is chance but do you think there is a possibility to him to stop zura somewhere at all or not at all
SPEAKER_03: yes I do think he I think people way underestimate Ryan and Ryan definitely possesses enough enough back pressure in the strap to negate that the side pressure and and I mean yeah I mean he's probably going to go and for sure he's not going to be the favorite but I do think you know
SPEAKER_03: Of course, nobody wants to bring up the fact that Ryan beat chance. I mean, it's three or four years ago and it's not the same chance and whatever, whatever, whatever. But Ryan is in the same league. I mean, he's he's not as explosive as chance to probably expose that weakness of Zara off the ready go.
SPEAKER_03: uh is the side pressure that transit much more than i yeah i think it's i think it's a a great great match and it's it it could be another ron bath is a rub match in my mind i mean i think that ryan possesses enough back pressure and side pressure to possibly make that really exciting a really long match and i think he i think he might fail at the end but i think he's strong enough to make it exciting stop him and give him a match you think
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's going to give him a match. He's going to give him a match. And Ryan has shown that he's pretty resilient. He's got pretty good endurance. So there you are saying that Ryan that we saw last time at East versus West against Ray is not the Ryan that we're talking about now. This is what you're saying. Yeah. No. Well, and Saurabh doesn't. There are so many things to consider. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Ray really took Brian completely out of position and turned his hand up right. I don't see Zurab doing that. I think Zurab's hook and just going side pressure and I don't know whether or not his hand holds up enough. I think it's a good match. I don't think it's an unreasonable, crazy, one-sided match that people have been saying. I think it's... I think if I would have said only Ryan versus Zurab, it could be tougher. But now...
SPEAKER_00: zurab has a left arm match with petrenko so i don't think he's gonna come there by like underestimating the competition because his competition main competition for in his mind is petrenko with left arm and petrician that he can with left arm at the last vote in 2019 yes i saw the match he just who came in comfortably with him it didn't even take three seconds the match that i saw
SPEAKER_00: I saw only one match. I don't know how the other match was. The match that I saw was maximum three seconds. He hooked him and then beat him comfortably. So what I'm just saying is Zurab, I don't think Zurab is going to go there in a regular shape. If he knew that he was going to pull only Ryan, then he would go different. But if he's pulling Petrenko, he's going there differently. Be in top shape. He's going to be in top shape. Anyway, so that is what we...
SPEAKER_02: wanted to ask. Anything you want to add, John? Sorry for taking so long. I'm having fun listening too. I mean, if Ryan wins a single match, I'm going to be shocked. I've been shocked before. Win or stop him? Slow him down or what? Stop him? I mean, I don't think Zurab is a flash pin guy anyway, so I don't think they'll be a legitimate stop, no. So you are saying that the match is not going to take
SPEAKER_02: 10 seconds. Yeah, I think they're going to be, I mean, I just, I don't see that Ryan can possibly have improved that much since the match with Ray to give. A match in a few weeks. I just don't see it. I think that maybe when the version of Ryan that pulled chance would be different. Cause I think he was stronger back then. Um, I know he's a lot bigger. I mean, just in my opinion, I saw a chance. He was much smaller.
SPEAKER_00: much younger. He's now even 24, then he was probably much younger. I mean, I'm just not taking any side or something, but if you want to be dropped, the blocking his wrist down here is not enough because he will drag you. So what you need to do to not to allow you to drag you, you also need to curl him without losing your own pronator. And then if you make him turn that way, he may not drag you because you're cutting his pronator the same way that Chen Xiao did it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I just don't think Zorob's hand is possibly strong enough to really use his arm strength against Ryan. I think that that will be his weakness is he's just, Brian's going to be able to put him in enough out of position that he's just not going to be able to, you know, pull maximum effort. He does that with his hand too, though, John, like he didn't match with you. You know, it's like he has that bizarre position and ends up somehow pulling a pin out of it. So I feel like, yeah,
SPEAKER_00: That's something he can use. John was John to hold him drop was not the problem, but to finish him was a little bit problem at the end. But just you also, whenever you waited also a little bit in a losing position, you waited, you allowed him to lock his everything on you. You didn't right away, put him out of position and beat him. You allow him to apply his horsepower to the end. Then you wanted to put him out of position and beat him.
SPEAKER_00: That was hard. To finish him was hard, but to hold him, was it hard, so hard for you to hold him whenever he was attacking? No, even when he took me to the center of the table like that, I felt like this is, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: i was i felt like i was in control and i had plenty of strength it was just awkward it didn't i was very shocked that that especially i you saw how displeased i was with the first call of that because i was actually i don't remember if i was in the strap or other strap i just remember like i was pushing pushing to make sure that he didn't slip you know so that's why it happened the way it happened but yeah yeah yeah those two matches like it was just kind of like
SPEAKER_00: weird you know second match you said it was your mistake to hold on and then he just brought you there but you could easily sleep and go to uh strap strap yeah yeah yeah but I think the third third round when you go to strap I think the reason that you waited you just also wanted to prove something you were not happy what happened in those two rounds of course of course yeah of course you are better you know this is right what I realized yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, so thank you very much, John. And thanks to everyone who watched us. And thank you, John, for helping me. And hope to see you tomorrow. And John, see you in five weeks.
