SPEAKER_01: heal up after the last match and then you know prepare for this one so you know i'll be ready i still got a couple weeks left to go you know i've done my last hard training and i'll be ready to go no doubt so yeah just make sure that rest well you know rest well yeah yeah i need it no doubt because you are already trained that match was hard but it was also an incredible training which needed a lot of you know recovery but once you recovered
SPEAKER_01: that match also was part of the, you know, your development, you know, because I mean, you did a lot, you know, so you, we can consider like you are totally out of training while we know that on the amount that you, you were in, I mean, incredible shape. Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, definitely that match was definitely about 15 trainings in one. So I definitely got a lot of work and you're right. It's it's that match was 1% training. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I normally advertise live on social media, Facebook especially, but I wrote on Facebook to a guy, I answered, you know, I don't know about who he was, but I said, he needs to pull and beat. And Facebook said it is against the rules. I don't know what they understood from that. They gave me 57 days of restriction. What?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, put an arm wrestling comment. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow, that's crazy. They are crazy. I disagree. They said we check again, you know, we are right. Like, I mean, what the hell, you know, just. Yeah, Facebook's really weird with stuff, man, and people and kicking people off. It's crazy. Yeah, yeah. Like, like, I mean, come on, you know, and I wrote this in an arm wrestling group, you know, arm wrestling group. So they, I mean, they need to listen, you know, they need to listen, you know, I, I, I,
SPEAKER_01: I explained to them, but they still, you know, I don't know what their problem is. Like, pull and beat. Because of these two words, I even posted on the Facebook that, you know, what they sent me, you know, what offended them and what was the decision. I mean. Yeah, they just used a couple of words that they don't take in the context of the words that were used, you know what I mean? So it doesn't even make any sense. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know where Ermes is. Anyway, we will be very happy to see you here again. What do you think about the whole card? Exciting?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the card is amazing from, you know, top to bottom. I mean, it's incredible. Our team is stacked, really. You got Devon involved now, John, myself, Matt, Mask, Paul. We have a team that's just incredible. So I'm really looking forward to watching almost every match, honestly. You know, it's going to be super exciting. I guess not expecting to, you know, I was hoping to get a little rest, but here I am, and I'm a part of it, so I'm super excited to be a part of it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, John Burzing, personally, he wrote me on WhatsApp, can you please make my match earlier? And I said, how early? He said, early enough to watch, you know, those Dave Chaffee, Ermes, Devon, you know, Matt Mask, you know, Morozov. He told me, so he's going to be the ninth match. You know, I need to explain to people that, because I have so much respect for him. And I...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yeah. And I, I will, I mean, people will think, oh, look at there. What did they, what Angin did to John? You know, he put him to the ninth match, but he requested from me because he wants to sit down and relax and watch the event because he always pulls the last and then he can't enjoy the event because of the pressure he has. But your match is also big pressure, big pressure. Yeah. There's, there's a lot on the line. Uh,
SPEAKER_00: this match so but with the john thing i see where he's coming from i see where you're coming i know you you respect him so much and you always want him to be the last match but he deserves it he's done you know everything in the sport so he he's he's you know the best of all time so he deserves that and i see his point where he wants to you know to go down a little lower sit down relax and watch the other matches so i definitely see both points i mean i could put him that much you know if he would ask me to put any earlier
SPEAKER_01: I would say, you know, not that much, you know, I'm not going to put you in earlier. He asked me, can you put me in the beginning? I said, oh yeah, sure. You know, first match, you can open up the card, first match. No, I would never do that. The matches that, you know, we made agreements, you know, like the Morozov versus Revaz, Matt Mask, Cobra, your match, you know, Ermes and Prudnik Devon, you know, they are understandable, you know.
SPEAKER_01: but anything before of course those are also very important matches but i would tell him you know come on you know just you can't be any earlier than that one you know no he's john he definitely definitely can't you know as much as he wants to i'm sure just to relax but he's john so he's unfortunately yeah i don't know where where hermes is but um i don't know i don't know what's what's going on but you know that right your your match is interim title
SPEAKER_01: uh i no actually i didn't it's for the it's for the title since jerry can't pull yeah yeah yeah what i said that i i somebody asked i was doing live with hermes and then somebody asked you know about you know what was this what was it going to be the last match or something and hermes and then something happened you know and i said
SPEAKER_01: I told Ermes, it is not the title match. He was like, why? I said, I mean, Jerry has a title. Justin because he got injured, I cannot take the title away from him. But I am not so knowledgeable about how the other sports are doing. But then I read that when somebody, a champion, is injured,
SPEAKER_01: and cannot pull so they do the match interim title and then so now this is a temporary champion until the champion comes back and later now we have two champions but later when he comes back they pull you understand and normally their first match needs to be this but
SPEAKER_01: we all know that you need rest for sure you know i mean i would never even ask you such thing again you know i i hardly convinced you to pull in january and now can you imagine that now you're coming here and pulling in november it's just like oh i mean i was very ashamed to ask you you know about that i was like oh i mean i should should i not i mean i mean who's gonna replace him you know and then thank you very much that you know that's why i said your heart is
SPEAKER_01: big you know your muscles are this big the heart is this big you know so you accepted and thank you and not only me that the whole community they they appreciate you know uh that you oh yeah somebody came you're always i i appreciate you you know thinking about me and giving me the shot um i definitely was looking to forward to a little bit of rest and then you sent me that message i'm like
SPEAKER_00: okay um now you're gonna make me make a decision here uh if jerry you know can't pull and stuff and i know i know me i'm a i'm a competitor i usually don't think with my brain i think with my arm so uh here i am you know and i i appreciate the the chance to uh you know to compete again your events are awesome and i'm looking forward to it i mean we appreciate we are honored to have you and and you know the real reason that ermis came late we said you know
SPEAKER_01: is how many minutes eight minutes late like do you know the reason because he sees himself superstar so he just comes like you know the guy is just too prideful we are only me and jeffy or more or two
SPEAKER_01: No, no, Morozov, because if Morozov comes, I need to bring translators, then there are like five screen, and then one is divided, but what to do, you know? It's good for you that Morozov will not be here. You couldn't handle both Dave and Morozov at once. Okay. Okay, so tell us, Ernest, what are you going to do to Dave's tendons?
SPEAKER_01: He was going to say that. It's good that you're seeing, you laugh, you laugh, you know. So, okay, I thought that it cannot be real, you know, because I don't think you have such power to do this. So you're laughing, so you are only joking. Okay, I understand. My friend, every time when I speak about Dave, you know,
SPEAKER_04: And Dave, you know, I respect him because he's a super athlete. He's very... He's another gladiator, you understand? Because he doesn't have to be scared to fight anyone. And he's super, super strong. Yeah, yeah. I mean, if you talk a little bit more this way, Dave will have mercy on you on that night. Mercy? What is it?
SPEAKER_01: mercy is just he will forgive you that night he will beat you slowly not easy you know like like if you talk like this okay so Ermes can you beat this man I think my style is very dangerous for him
SPEAKER_04: But we do my best and we see. Because now I don't know where is my level because in one year I think my powers grow up a lot. And yes, I tested with practice with some guy but
SPEAKER_04: the competition is different, you know? Sure, Davit, he has more confidence because this year he has a lot of matches. Maybe he has more control of adrenaline like this. Because if you compete many times,
SPEAKER_01: Emotionally, you have more control. And this match, for me, is a very, very good test. Yeah, yeah. This is what I was thinking, yeah? Yeah, this is what I was thinking. I mean, I'm telling you, I don't know if you can beat him or if you cannot beat him. I don't know that. But no disrespect to Dave.
SPEAKER_01: But if you cannot beat Dave, I think that, I mean, it means that you are not at somewhere to beat Levan. I don't know if you would agree with this statement, Dave, or would you take it as an offense? I mean, as of now, the guy seems like he's the best one, Levan, Dave. Not for me? No, no, I'm just saying that if Ermes cannot beat you,
SPEAKER_01: it will automatically mean that he's not ready for Levan. Would you take this comment as a disrespect to you? No, no, I don't take it as any disrespect. It could go either way, too, if I don't... No, no, no, but I'm just saying, no, not that way. I mean, Levan right now being stronger than you, I mean, he proved. Yeah, that makes sense. You proved otherwise. For now, Levan is the best.
SPEAKER_00: So what I'm just saying that if Ermes cannot beat you, it will automatically mean that he cannot beat Levan either. Do you agree with this? I mean, in theory, yeah, that makes sense. Justin because the way the match with Levan and I went, and if I do beat Ermes, then yeah, he, you know, you would think he's not ready, but who knows? I mean, different styles make different matches and you do never know. And I don't take that as any disrespect at all. I think Levan's incredible.
SPEAKER_00: um i know both of us would love a shot to pull him myself again and ermis would love to pull him so i think this this match we're both going to be incredibly fired up um it's going to be a war um and like you said i don't i don't uh feel any disrespect about that comment at all no no there is nothing disrespectful but you may think that you are better than levan so that's what i am saying that for me you and ermis
SPEAKER_04: For me, I'm an organizer. I wouldn't comment, but it's a big question mark for me. I really do not know. I really don't know. I mean, but yeah. But for me, I don't know. Maybe Dave, he knows more than me. But for me now, Dave is not the same shape when I fought with Levan.
SPEAKER_00: Because what do you think, Dave? You are the same shape when you fought with Levan or now more power or more endurance? I think I'm a little more well-rounded now. I know a few more things than when I pulled Levan. I think it would be a little different if I could get him in the strap, see what happened.
SPEAKER_00: But, yeah, I think I'm a different puller than when I pulled Levan, especially mentally. Like, I waited forever for that match to take place. Yeah. Because you think with the strap, you have more chance with Levan? I think so, yeah. I think, you know, his hand's so strong. Try to contain his hand so big. I mean, it's just, I think anybody has a better chance to do it on a strap. It's just my opinion. Ah.
SPEAKER_01: sorry guys yeah i don't know we will see we will see this guy and this match this match will tell i mean the truth is um we know where you are dave we know where you are because you in this year you have pulled a lot of very very high level matches while hermes since early uh 2022 he did not pull
SPEAKER_01: uh right arm matches and we do not know where he is at he is young he is improving and this match will be a test for uh hermes for us to see where he is at do you agree with that hermes like because yeah yeah i think i think you improve a lot uh but this match will show us where exactly you are yeah
SPEAKER_04: because you know here in italy i don't have a yes with your friend with the the the elastic band like this but it's not same like if you have a good good trainer trainer with a good strength you understand same maybe when a georgian guy like
SPEAKER_01: Lewandowski with Revaz or Revaz with Gennady. This is a good test for... Ermes, do you think that during the off-season or when you are getting ready to competition, you should travel in short distance and then train with some other people? I think you do sometimes. You have done training with Kurdesha, you have done training with Ermes. Yeah, yeah. But I think that
SPEAKER_01: after you accepted the match with uh jerry and then now it's become uh david you we didn't see you training with with anyone who is known you know only probably against two hands with your italian friends yeah yeah yeah i tested only two times with kurdeca in march and in august in istanbul yeah
SPEAKER_04: But after this, you know, the different styles maybe are more different. You find your weakness if you compete or you train with another athlete. Yeah, let's see. Dave, do you think that on the competition day against Ermes, you will be ready?
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely. Um, I'll be a hundred percent ready. Um, I have no excuses. Um, I'm coming in, you know, like I said, I had the match, you know, it took it on short notice, but, um, um, I rested a few weeks, about three weeks. I didn't do anything after I came home from the battalion match.
SPEAKER_00: My elbow started to feel a little better. Um, I'm actually getting a shot in my neck here, uh, next Tuesday. So that hopefully will help with my left arms. Like now I'm having low most of the time. I, two left, two of my fingers on my left arm are, are totally numb, but that's my left side. So, you know, that's going to take care of that. Hopefully. Um, my right, my right side feels pretty good right now. So as long as, uh, you know, I get over there, get some rest, um, I'm coming to one day earlier. So hopefully that'll give me a little more, you know, more.
SPEAKER_00: you know, another day's sleep to try to get used to the, you know, the, the time change and jet lag and stuff like that. Um, so yeah, I'll be ready. No excuses. Me and Ermes, I'm looking forward to this. Ermes, uh, you know, I've been pulling a long time. We get up, we've been, you know, pulled a ton of guys over the last couple of years and there's not a ton of guys I want to pull. Um, I'll accept matches, but Ermes is one of those guys that I want to pull. Um, he's, he's incredible what he's done the last couple of years. Uh,
SPEAKER_00: And yes, he's looking big. So it's definitely going to be a challenge for me to see where he's at. And you were saying that you want to know where he's at. It's going to be a test. I think everybody wants to know where he's at actually right now. So everybody's going to be able to match closely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And do you have any kind of prediction? Because you both just exchanged some words. And then is it because of like,
SPEAKER_01: one once uh because when erma said that you know uh like he's afraid to put uh pictures and this and this he actually was he actually was laughing you understand but whenever i i wrote those things you know on social media when you don't put anything with smile or something it sounds like very serious so it is naturally that you also answer him so when you answer him he answered he said he's gonna apart your fingers from your
SPEAKER_01: arm hand you know whatever and then and then you said we will see you know and like does it does it like um how to say does it represent your real thoughts when you are exchanging words like this to each other uh maybe just a tiny bit you know but it's some good good joking you know back and forth i know he is he has gotten a lot bigger so i you know i talked about you know he was 175 pounds when you know 10 years ago whatever that was
SPEAKER_00: messing with him and stuff you know try to get his head a little bit um but you know look at him now he's huge so that's a different guy i know that um i have 100 respect for ermys uh he's an incredible athlete incredible puller um but you know just going back and forth it's kind of funny i'm just happy he's gonna save my save my tendons rather than you know take them too so i appreciate that
SPEAKER_04: It's very difficult to write this thing with Dave, you know, because it's too much... Respect, you know? Yeah, maybe with Matt Mask or Dave it's more easy, you know, you have more... Yeah, because they have the same type of person.
SPEAKER_01: With Dave it's too difficult to write this message. With Matt Mask and Devon it's easy because you think you can beat them. With Devon and Matt Mask it's easy for you to talk because you think your chance is much higher. With Dave you cannot talk that way because he's too strong.
SPEAKER_01: I understand you, yeah. Yeah, you understand. Dave, I always like to tease this guy, you know. He's like a good brother, you know. I like to tease him and he knows that I'm joking with him. He never gets upset with me. Yeah. That's it. I can tell. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so, I mean, so.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, unless you said like respect and respect again, respect and respect, you know, Dave, be easy on this guy, okay? You saw how much he respects you. I'll take it in general, don't worry. Yeah, I really don't know. I really don't know because Dave, you are, I mean, especially the fresh rounds, last match you also showed that
SPEAKER_01: not in the way that you pull in but in different way transition like maybe the way your main weapon got tired but you just added something totally fresh against your opponent's tired pulling style which was already
SPEAKER_01: like had the bottle with your main weapon, and then you both get tired and then you suddenly added something fresh, but you were not very experienced about it. But I realized that once you put your heart in it 100%, you don't really have to plan anything. You just do whatever it takes to win. And that moment, I have a question.
SPEAKER_00: Did you make any plan to beat him that way? Or dare you figure it out? No, well, the first match when I got the top role, I couldn't quite pin him. And usually I just, I'm not thinking, I just, you know, I'm really aggressive trying to pin the guy. And I'm like, you know what, I'm going to just relax and hang out here for a little bit. And as I'm hanging out, I'm thinking, okay, maybe I can transition to a press here. And, you know, I waited for the right moment and it worked the first match. I was like, wow.
SPEAKER_01: I can actually do this. Okay. But did you plan this before the match or there? I think the reason Dave, his arm is so tall, like over two meters. So the more you pull you, you are out of like space anymore. His arm is just coming so much.
SPEAKER_00: So even you take him down, you know, he still doesn't come to the pin pad. His reach is so high, you know. So, okay, tell us the rest of the story. After the first round? Like you said, though, his arm's so long, he wasn't easy to pin, but I ended up getting him. And then the second match, the same. But then later on, when I got really tired, I'm thinking, okay, I can try to go back to what I was doing before, you know, try to get him there and then press him. But...
SPEAKER_00: I was so tired. Like it was unbelievable. You're right. You just, you just do what you got to do. And, and, you know, someone might've been helping me in the corner, sending text messages, you know, what to do this or when to do that, you know, which kind of helped out. And so, so, but yeah, later on when I think it was the sixth, the sixth, there were so many fouls too, like in restarts and it just, it was ridiculous. And I was, I was so tired, but I'm looking at him. I'm like,
SPEAKER_00: he's more tired than me. So this, this, you know, that made me more fired up. I'm like, I got this. There's nothing I'm going to lose this match. I came out the sixth match actually, you know, fired up. I was like, this is, I'm going to, I'm going to win this thing. And there's nothing he can do to do it. Cause I'm, I'm, I'm pressing them and I'm thinking,
SPEAKER_00: i've said this before i got nothing left i'm like my son can probably beat me right now there's no way but he's more he's more tired than me and that's going through my head right now so just waiting waiting for the right time to you know just to adjust and then pin him and then and then the seventh seventh match was the same thing i was there was no way i was gonna lose i was just i was just fired up i knew he was i i was tired i knew he was tired and it was just all all mental there from from there on yeah yeah yeah and um have you ever
SPEAKER_00: Ruben Duran- One that way, have you ever tried that before in your during your career i'm not really not like that, no I can't think of me don't remember I at least I don't remember. Ruben Duran- yeah I think left handed I did in 2010 w w af but that was left handed that was that was you know different just because I don't realize my left hand or whatever, but I can't really think of.
SPEAKER_01: of a time that i've done it honestly another question this it when it is something that you didn't try before and then you try first time and it wasn't easy did it cause any uh elbow uncomfortable joint anything like that later that that there's something that you didn't feel before or after recovery everything is okay you know
SPEAKER_00: I was pretty sore after the match, you know, for a couple of weeks. Cause you know, that's a lot of pressure on the elbow, but honestly I took a few weeks off and it feels, it feels good. My elbow's fine right now. So, but that's the thing. I don't practice that because it hurts. Now you do that press. It hurts my elbow. I got, I have something wrong with my elbow. I don't know what it is. I probably should get it taken care of. Cause it, cause it always hurts a little bit, but it's the same, the same as it was. So it didn't do any more, any more damage than my regular pulling does, which is surprising to me, honestly.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but you also gain some confidence, right? Now, like, nothing is better than training for it, you understand? And you did this during a very important match, that level, like, at the practice training is easy to do. It's not easy, but still, you know, but when you do this against someone like Laletin, I mean, you now like, should have some confidence that you know, if I am
SPEAKER_01: Like, necessarily, I hit, you know, Ermes comes here, I transition, and then Ermes is down. Right, Ermes? Definitely. My friend, it's better you don't put your shoulder like this. It's very dangerous for you. Against you? Against you, too. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah it's like you know it's like having another another weapon in your in your in your holster if you got to use it it's there so i i never practiced with it ever ever at all so to actually pull that out of the mask for the first time i know the video maybe you can you use this style for for going the strap or not
SPEAKER_04: I mean, it could, yeah. You go under. Maybe with Travis, like when you are, your wrist is open, you use this movement for going the strap. But no for this. Not for winning. Yeah. There is a super chat. Matt Kruger, thank you for your super chat. Everyone says it is going to be a grip fight. Who has the strongest grip? Dave or Ermes?
SPEAKER_04: I don't know it's going to be a grip bite. I don't think so. Like this? I mean, that like, I don't know. But the grip is not very important. Yeah, I mean, if you are strong. When you test your grip like here with machine, you know, like this. The important grip is here, not here. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: yeah i can tell you i can tell you this the latin latin's grip on the machine is twice as strong as mine so yeah but here is about two different too much differently here yeah no and the reason yeah i understand and and another question uh um dave which lalatin
SPEAKER_01: you took the center i'm talking about fresh best matches you know right away you took the center with alex kurdecha he took the center and then you you remember you went here first and then first round i'm talking about yeah and can you compare them to each other like would it be good match
SPEAKER_00: I think it would be a good match. It's hard because, I mean, I don't know how much Alex has gotten better. We pulled in April. So to compare April to now, that's a big difference. But I think the Latin compared was a little bit stronger. I couldn't quite pin him, you know, with a top roll. The defensive position is strong, but at the center, you took him down here. So what I'm just saying is
SPEAKER_01: Alex may not be strong enough at the defense, but his offense, he started so quick. I'm just saying that if he takes the center with Laletin, could Laletin survive like you did against Alex? I'm just saying that you have so much horsepower. I don't know if Laletin has the same horsepower or not.
SPEAKER_00: So I'm just saying that if Alex got some better, and I see that he's bigger now, so do you think that there is a possibility it would be a good match between them? I do. I think it would be a good match. Like, you're right. If Alex gets explosive and takes him over to the defensive side and adjust, I don't know if Lalletin can come back. Like you said, he's really got a really defensive hold. I think it would be a really good match. I think it could go either way for sure. It's interesting. We know Lalletin has
SPEAKER_01: Position gainer, you know, he just takes everything. With you, he was in kind of like defensive position here. He lost probably here, the riser, but he was still hanging here and holding that way. That was interesting that he had that kind of luck at the losing position. Yeah, it was interesting. He was really strong there. I was impressed. He was holding power there, definitely. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: with the lady is very impressive when you you go on the table with him because i remember with the lady you you came on the table and you is a giant you there are a lot of pressure when you fight the lady because there's his arm is longer like this super giant
SPEAKER_01: He's so big. It's uncomfortable pulling because he's so big and so long and his hands are so big. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the super heavyweight category, I have been involved in arm wrestling for the last 30 years internationally. I have never seen that hard competition in the super heavyweight. I cannot say for the weight classes, the level went up so much.
SPEAKER_01: because that competition has been there forever. But for the super heavyweight, the things that just so, I don't know, like the whole world can't pick with the numbers in the world. That is, I mean, no matter who you ask, everyone has different opinion. And people at least at the end, they agree that, okay, we don't know who he is. It's not clear yet. And I think soon we will find,
SPEAKER_01: even i don't think that there will be a permanent number two you know like levan look looks like like a solid number one because the style makes matches and then this guy can be that guy that guy with that guy this guy beats this guy so i mean you understand like some guys are just because of the style maybe dangerous for the
SPEAKER_01: other ones so we will never know you may be somebody and somebody beats that guy and other guy beats that guy also we don't really keep the same shape you know non-stop you know all years or all two years long you know sometimes you're a little bit this sometimes you go a little bit down you know i mean do you guys disagree that you know that is do you guys think that there is a clear number two in the world right now i i totally agree there's no there's no clear number two there's
SPEAKER_00: five six guys I say that could be that could be number two um yeah I think Lavon's number one and I always say this before be it'd be like awesome to have just like a tournament of like eight eight other guys to to see who who the number two is um because there's and I agree with you too like people don't yes with the top eight like the number eight guys but uh it's difficult too because uh
SPEAKER_04: Like you, Dave, when you fought with Levan. If you go immediately with the strongest guy, you go immediately in the low class. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And maybe you can beat the third or fourth, but you can't pull with him. You understand his point, Dave?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, if Levan is number one, whoever is meeting him on the first round or the top eight or something, he won't even top four because he already lost on the first round because he was unlucky that he met Levan.
SPEAKER_01: early so i i kind of think that the number two guys are having super matches against each other and then the one that looks you know better that he would have a shot with levan i think this is a better way because i mean anyone anyone who meets levan first round he's losing his chance to be number two so there needs to be a number two guy there needs to be top eight without levan
SPEAKER_01: That's what I meant. I was trying to say that. Not including all the other guys. Then you have no excuse. You cannot say, I meet this guy. If you want to beat number two to Levan, whoever you meet, you need to beat. Absolutely. This is what it is. Anyway, there is a super chat that I want to ask. Sorry, guys, but I really need to answer. I don't want to upset them.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you for your super chat. This is my favorite match in East versus West 5. Great matchup, Engin. Davit, regarding Levan, how much more power would you need to win? 20%, 40%? Thanks. Before I ask, thank you for your super chat. I mean, 20% and 40% are incredible. If you are like this with a guy,
SPEAKER_00: 5%, you would do like this, you know, with the guy. 20%, 40%, you would just lift the guy off from the pad. But what's your opinion? I mean, I don't know about a percent. It's hard to tell a percent. Like you said, 20%, 40%, that would be crazy strength. Yeah. Honestly, I'd like to pull him in the straps if I got a shot. Win or lose, I don't know. I can't say I would win, but I think I would have a better shot to beat him. Strength-wise, he's incredible. His hand is so strong.
SPEAKER_00: he's so powerful. Um, I'm hoping he gets just, you know, kind of complacent at the top and he doesn't train quite as much maybe. And he just lets us, you know, catch up to him a little bit. That that's, that's my hopes. So. Yeah. Um, I don't know. I will not answer the question. Sorry guys. Devon't please ask this kind of question. I'm not, I'm not, uh, I don't care about who is kissing who, you know, just,
SPEAKER_01: that they're not talking about us you know they're talking about someone else kissing someone else what do we think about um so let's see okay so we can we can go back to the subject so uh when we chat with you and jerry you said jerry's chance is two percent and when we chat again you said david's chance is one percent do you still
SPEAKER_01: Are you still behind your word or there was a joke as well? What? Are you behind your word or you were joking again? No, no, my friend, possible now. 1% only, yes. 0.5. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_04: And you are serious or joking? Now my shape is very, very good and I felt my wrist and my pronation, my finger, arm, everything super strong. And I saw many matches with Jeffy, but if I take a little
SPEAKER_04: his wrist, the match is already finished. Yeah, maybe he can do something in the center. Maybe I pull for... No, I go down. I don't go down immediately because it's very powerful here. So once you stop... In my mind, I don't think he can do... My arm goes in the lowest position.
SPEAKER_01: So you are saying that your arm will not go into the losing position. So you said that even the match can be a little bit tough, but it will not be going down like here. Like I don't know. I don't. You don't think so? Yeah. And do you think there is any possibility for him to take your wrist?
SPEAKER_04: Only if he has too much different power of my arm. I know, I know. That's how it can be. If his arm is too much powerful, yeah, it's impossible. But do you think that his arm is too much powerful? No. I don't think it's too much powerful to take my wrist. Okay, so you are saying that your wrist is strong enough to handle his back pressure.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Yeah. And Dave, you have any, any, uh, else about this one, what he says? 1%. So, you know, they're saying that's a chance. That's good. So I got a 1% chance. I'm going to show up and take that chance. That's good. Ernie's is strong. He's confident. I give him credit there. And I think the match is going to go a little bit different than he thinks in his, in his head.
SPEAKER_00: Um, so unfortunately he's not going to be too happy once he grips up with me. Um, I can't wait for this match. It's going to be awesome. Um, I'm really looking forward to it and you know, the best man win. Definitely. I'm fired up for this one. Yeah. You don't want to talk like so confident, but you are saying that, uh, you are thinking that the things will not go as Ermes is thinking.
SPEAKER_00: absolutely yeah his his head his head's got his uh you know thinking a little bit different than the match is going to go so yeah it's going to be going to be different he'll be sad but it's okay i'll buy him a drink after the match but it's normal that you know he
SPEAKER_01: needs to feel that way. I mean, his training is getting big, his numbers with the weights and everything is up. So there is nothing more normal than him to be confident. I think there is nothing wrong with it.
SPEAKER_01: And because you can go to a match that, you know, thinking that you need to make everything, every plan for winning. I mean, if you don't believe you're going to win, you don't accept the match. Did you accept the match, Dave? Justin thinking that, okay, I'm going to go. Most likely I will lose, but, you know, okay, let me go. Probably you also believe that, you know, I mean, you're training. You are one of the best in the world, Dave. And I'm sure that even when you go to Levan, you went there to win, you know. You lost, but you didn't go there to lose, for sure. Am I wrong?
SPEAKER_00: No, you always do win confident. I'm not the type of guy that's going to come out and say, you know, I'm going to win. I'm not going to boast about how strong I am. My actions are done on the table. And you're going to see that. I'm 100% confident I'm going to win this match. I wouldn't have accepted the match if I didn't think I could win. And you're going to see that November 19th. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, we all are different, you know. Some like Devon, Prudnik.
SPEAKER_01: You know, they are different. You are different. Some like to say like, okay, I'm going to show at the table. Some even make songs and sing for each other. Yeah, I'm here to wait the song. Every time I check YouTube. Ermes, how about let's make a song with you and you sing for Dave. What?
SPEAKER_01: You and I, we make a song together and you sing for Dave before the match. I don't. I'm not an actor. You don't need to act. Justin sing, you know. Your voice is a little bit terrible, but so what to do, you know. I want to hear a song from him. I want to hear this now. Dave, it is very, very hard for someone to make a song for you.
SPEAKER_01: It is easier to make song for Devon or Nick or Michael or something, you know, a lot of things to use, you understand? But with you, I mean, when people look at you, they see only respect. I mean, they better not sing at all, you know? If instead of you, there was Devon, who is going to pull Ermes now, I mean, now this conversation would be woo!
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, there is Dusty Rabion. Hi guys, how would Dave do against Devon today? Do you have any opinion, Dave? And do you think that when there is no wall, elbow pads, and then the question.
SPEAKER_01: If the elbow pads were the ones that, you know, how is the East versus West right there? And if this would be prohibited on that day, could you be there? I know you don't like to talk these things, but just ask him. You don't have to answer. No, I think I'll be honest with you. Yeah, I think I would have won if that was no King's move and the pads were different. Yeah, I think I would have won. Unfortunately, it is what it is. The match turned out to be the ugliest match in the world.
SPEAKER_00: in the history of armwrestling. Devon't like to talk about it, unfortunately, but that's the way it went. But yeah, I think things would have been different, I think, if there was no Kings move and the pads were different. Yeah, I do. I understand. I remember when I saw this match, it was very, very shit. With a double key move. Horrible.
SPEAKER_01: Hey, Devon fans, don't attack me, Devon fans. This is a super chat. It was a super chat that I asked, okay? Okay, anyway, so another question, Dave. If it is unavoidable, would you pull another American at the East versus West, or if it is a title match? I'd rather not. I would if I had to.
SPEAKER_01: But I mean, it's East versus West. I like coming over, being part of the team, pulling, you know, the East. That's kind of the fun part for me to do that. Yeah, but if you have the title and the other guy is the, like, for example, if you beat Ermes now, and then this is the interim title that Jerry has it. So, I mean, you understand? Yeah, so you both would,
SPEAKER_01: i think that it would be better if you would both defend the title against an eastern guy and then if one of you loses then then then that guy and the american guy would pull each other maybe we should do that way right i like i like that idea yeah definitely yeah yeah yeah i understand but here we also have many east versus east matches but it is different okay why why not west versus west matches we do east versus east matches but we're talking about kazakhstan let's say
SPEAKER_01: um georgia you understand we could be talking about like italy we're talking about different countries we say east but we're talking about different nations but whenever you say you versus jerry it's the same as like levels is pulling with gennady yeah yeah yeah so so we better not do that that's good good idea i i will have that but if somehow like for example someday if revas somehow beats everyone
SPEAKER_01: And then that's unavoidable that he needs to pull with Levan. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways, so Ermes, so what we understand that Dave is not going to pass the center. He has only 1% of chance. Oh no, sorry, 0.5% chance. And then he thinks that, you know, the things will go different than what you are imagining.
SPEAKER_04: and on november 19th i don't know what he think to do uh he said he's gonna show at the table the only specific saying oh he go in the hook on the top row there are no magic techniques i don't need i don't need magic i can beat you i know i know he wanted to go in the top row like i understand it doesn't mean that you said that
SPEAKER_01: He cannot take your wrist and he cannot pass center. So it doesn't mean that he needs to go home. He can take your wrist. He can pass the center. He can even beat you. So this is what he means. He says that the things are not going to go as you expect. He doesn't talk about the way that he's going to pull that you think. He's talking about the result will be different than what you are thinking. Am I wrong, Dave? I don't know. Oh, yeah, you're right. You're exactly right. Yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so let's see. I can't wait. I'm just now closing my eyes. And then the announcer, I'm not gonna say who will be the announcer because Devon Underwood had an accident. He cannot come. And we found another guy to announce. And I'm not gonna say who he is, maybe a few days later. But I'm just thinking, he is announcing.
SPEAKER_01: and then and Dave Chaffee comes there and then Ermes Gasparini is coming there and they are gripping up Ermes is your heart start beating a little bit faster every time my friend when I pull yes yes it is of course normal it doesn't mean you are scared it means that you are like I mean
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah there is no warrior that goes to battlefield with a sword and is yeah yeah yeah well whenever i imagine you guys coming to there you know and gripping up just ermes gasparini and dave chaffee together gripping up and the redigo is coming that that picture when you look at it you too i mean you both are i mean incredible incredible and then finally you two meeting
SPEAKER_01: Wow. Wow. I mean, it is. And after he shake my hand, his face changes immediately. Oh, he will hold your hand. Change immediately, my friend. No, no, Ermes, I think this is my guess. He's going to hold your hand. He's going to say, oh, did I train with this weak guy? Oh, you like.
SPEAKER_04: okay okay maybe i misunderstood you what did you mean maybe i misunderstood you what did you mean his face will change what do you mean when he shake my hand in the setup yeah and he will he will feel everything my hand yeah he his face change we change immediately but to which way
SPEAKER_01: He will think that you are weak or he will think you are strong. My friend, no joking with me like this. Okay, what you are saying, basically, he will hold your hand and whenever he feels your incredible power, he will say, oh, shit. I never accepted this match. Is this what he will say? My friend, don't pull. You're weak already. You're weak already.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, he's going to tell you. I'm not going to fool you. It's already your victory. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, Dave, I'm not going to say anything. Dave, you have the microphone. Yeah, I don't think it's going to go like that. Like I said, all that weight he's gained has gone to his head, apparently. He's not thinking straight. So it's going to be different than he thinks in his head, definitely.
SPEAKER_00: I cannot wait. Like I said, he's one of the guys I've been wanting to pull here for a couple years now. So he's going to be very disappointed. I've pulled bigger, I've pulled stronger in my career. So I'm not scared, not going to be scared. Justin really looking forward to this one. Yeah, yeah. And then he will probably say, I wish I never gained after 176 pounds, you know, just five.
SPEAKER_01: you are the young one here so this is why i'm teasing you yeah yeah did you did you see dave the prudnik's last video no i didn't he told the devil go down with the weight yeah yeah yeah he says that he says that uh he said he is worried about his match with devon he says he admits that
SPEAKER_01: but he said he's worried for Devon because Devon tried to win the super heavyweight title and he says Devon destroyed him and he now goes to heavyweight and Prudnik says he's going to destroy him there and he says that he is afraid that he will go down to light heavyweight and Ongarbe will destroy him and he says will you go down to
SPEAKER_01: middleweight and then Rustam Babay will destroy you too. And he said he is afraid that Devon is going to end up lightweight in a year because he cannot win another category. Those are some strong words right there. How do you see that? Does it make you excited? Before that, I will ask you to read because I'm missing later.
SPEAKER_01: you are mighty thanks for this epic event engine i love you um brother i think for your support and everybody's support and i'm happy that whenever you guys are happy and uh like what i'm doing and then i'm more motivated curious thank you for your super chat dave he has a he has a better chance over jerry versus hermes um he's
SPEAKER_04: If Dave will go with Jarry, he will win 100%. I understand. Because his style is too powerful for Jarry. Or not. Jarry, he couldn't go in his position.
SPEAKER_04: dave is strong yeah you go in the hook like this and jerry he couldn't go in the flop press or wrong correct or not dave um over the years i've been very successful against jerry we've pulled
SPEAKER_00: I think six or seven different matches and tour matches, and I've won them all so far. Things might be different. You know, maybe, you know, you got a little stronger and stuff. But my style does match up good with Jerry's. You're right about that. Yeah. Anyway, so let's go talk about Devon and Brittany. Does it excite you? What do you think about Brittany? Do you think he's a dangerous opponent, Dave?
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely. Like, I'm really excited about this match. I think it could go either way. I don't know. I don't think Devon, I know he wouldn't take this match if he wasn't ready, wasn't prepared.
SPEAKER_00: So I know he knows in his mind he can win this. Prudnik's very confident. He's so powerful, so explosive and strong, you know, hook, top roll. I don't know where Devon's going to go. He'll probably go into the open top roll type thing, you know, if he has to. And, you know, if he can wait out Prudnik, gas him out, I think he's got a good chance. Devon's super smart. He knows exactly what he's got to do to win. Same with Prudnik, though. You know, he's very intelligent on the table.
SPEAKER_00: They're both strong, great, great warriors. I'm looking forward to this match. I got to go with Devon, of course. He's on my team. I'm rooting for him. I think he's going to win. So 100%, that's where my vote is right there. Yeah, I'm happy that you guys have team spirit, you know? Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, it's good. It's good. I like it.
SPEAKER_01: the how did you like today today the the song that i added to uh did you see that the the burning heart he says that is it east versus west or man yes that's perfect yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean we need that that kind of uh competition as long as everything is you know like not toxic
SPEAKER_01: know but in in a like teasing each other competition competition is good you know that is what keeps us you know you know alive you understand but you know it doesn't have to be dirty we will never be like this you know i'm sure you guys will pull after that you guys will hug each other and then chat and laugh and have a picture and you know that's the beauty of it but at the table hermes you will be right destroy you will destroy
SPEAKER_01: dave dave write this down you know don't forget this thing come on believe me i won't forget yeah after you beat him what happened you know you were gonna destroy me remember i'd be like i'm still standing here here i am yeah wow wow i can't believe that that was two powerful men wow it will be incredible and and how do you see i know you support devon but how you don't want to give prediction
SPEAKER_00: 3-2 Devon. Another question. Were you surprised when the way that Prudnik beat Taka Shinks? Yes, I was. I really was. Because I know Todd is strong. I wasn't expecting that at all. I know I pulled with Todd, you know, numerous times over the last couple of years and come and train with me every now and again. So I know he's strong and to watch Prudnik, you know, beat him the way he did. I was impressed. Utterly impressed. Do you think that Prudnik
SPEAKER_00: could be at CRED even for superior weights? Absolutely. If he put on some weight, 100%. Evgeny at his weight now, he can be. But if he puts on a little more weight and power, definitely could be. Yes. Yeah. So do you expect a close match? It could go either way, even if you support Devon? I do. I do think it could go either way. Because like I said, I don't think Devon would take this match if he wasn't prepared and ready for it. So I think it could go either way. I think it's going to be a really good match.
SPEAKER_04: Devon, in the last month, he trained a lot with training partners around the world. Or not. Yeah. I mean, he did a lot of pull. I mean, we need to accept that this guy... If I train like him, for me it's impossible.
SPEAKER_01: yeah your power would go for inflammation for tendon for everything possible yeah the guy is crazy if he can pull five six hours non-stop and next day he can still pull i mean forget about it i can't do that i'm hurt i'm hurt for like two weeks i don't know but he's putting mileage you know during the trainings but the guy is still very good you know still very good and the guy is
SPEAKER_01: unlike some people are thinking the guy is very brave, you know, I mean, he was going to come here right after the surgeries day before he was going to be with his son during the surgery, he was going to take him to the home, put him in the bed and talk. And then he was going to come with the plane. And then only four hours before the competition, after 14 hours playing and then seven hours,
SPEAKER_01: time difference and imagine the jet lag and everything. And then four hours later, I said, you sure? He said, yeah, I'm going to come and show. I said, you better start changing your sleeping time so that you will not be like this. You know, he said, no problem.
SPEAKER_01: Good that they changed the date of the surgery so he doesn't have to come in the last moment. But I can tell you he was 100% ready to step. And then imagine from airport to there, you know, Dave is about like one and a half hour, you know. And then he would have like only a few hours to pull against Prudnik. And he was going to do that. I don't think that anyone else would try this, you know. That's crazy. That's impressive for someone to do that. That's wow.
SPEAKER_01: witness because about one hour you know we talked video chat with him he's like we were planning planning planning how we can you know to bring you here you know and we were like you know how to call miss jody and this and that and then yeah and then with the day change and thanks to jody that uh she allowed you know uh and so anyways how do you see that match
SPEAKER_04: I think Prudnik will go down not too fast to win and the match is very close. The endurance of Devon is too much.
SPEAKER_04: The first and the second round, I think he will win Prudnik. I don't know the third match, the third round. So you are saying that Prudnik will win the first two rounds? Yeah. And with a fast, fast win, you are saying? Not fast, but a little bit. But he will probably take him to the bad position because... Yeah, maybe...
SPEAKER_04: they won't he can hold him in the bad position okay yeah but he could work in the second match but the public if he will win and the third match i don't know if bruni he have enough power to beat the andrews yeah yeah but the king can you imagine how interesting match wow i mean incredible matches like sunday is like for example i saw
SPEAKER_01: Only a few weeks ago at the WAF, he won the WAF Worlds. You know how strong is Alexander Getalo. Remember, Ermes? He had like 10 minutes match with Vitaly. Remember when you won the World Championships? Yeah. In the 100 kilo, he had a 10-minute match with Vitaly and he is many times more. More, 15. I don't know. I remember 10, maybe more. And then, Sandris beat him in hook this event. Long match, very big war.
SPEAKER_01: But Sandris beat him in hook. And I was thinking that Sandris is, wow, incredible. I was thinking that Matt is going to beat him when I saw Matt against Krasimir. And then now I saw Sandris and maybe Sandris has too much horsepower. Then today I saw the forearm video, Matt Mask. Did you guys see that one, Dave? He's looking beautiful. And I was like, what's going to happen? You know, like, what the hell, you know?
SPEAKER_01: I'm so confused you know so and then today Sunday is also made it arm, but I mean he's not like you're really muscular guys super super muscular guy you look big, but the way that map looks he just. I don't know any opinion, they.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I seen the way Matt looks. He looks monstrous. I was like, holy shit. That form was ridiculous. Sandris is, like you said, he won the WAF title a couple weeks ago, a few weeks, whenever it was, a few weeks ago. He looked really amazing. I don't know. It's going to be a really good match. I got to go with Matt, of course, but I think it's going to be a really good one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But that...
SPEAKER_01: The excitement is off the roof right now. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, that's crazy. It's going to be a fun match to watch. You know, Matt's always fun to watch. He's very exciting. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It actually didn't want to pull him because he's cursing so much. For the mind, he's very dangerous, Matt Mask. Too much. See, it's very, very, in USA,
SPEAKER_04: When I fought him the first time, my mind was completely down. I saw only the loser's position with him. Because he's too much aggressive, you understand? And for me, Matt Mask,
SPEAKER_04: I think he is the most dangerous set-up for everybody. If he has a good shape. Now I prefer to go with Dave for the set-up than Matt Mask. Because Matt Mask is very smart, big hand.
SPEAKER_04: It's very difficult to take it the same, you understand? But he's super, super strong in the pronation and breathes everything here. Yeah. Anyway, so Furious is asking, Dave, grow your hair back for one of your matches. It would look pretty silly because, I mean, I kind of have a nice bald spot right here. It would look
SPEAKER_01: quite absurd, but listen, if I could grow my hair back, I would. Unfortunately, I'm too old. And Russell Tyrone Jones, thank you for your support. If you win Ermes, who would you want to face next? Me or Dave? You, you, you. Me? Yeah. I want to go with... If you win, if you. After I win, I will go with Levan.
SPEAKER_01: no no not after you beat dave if you beat dave if you know after no no not after okay if i will win with baby i want to go with the liver okay i want to try oh yeah and lewan's english teacher thank you for your super chat lewan look at hermes he never missed my class
SPEAKER_01: oh okay Devon's English teacher he says that you know look at Ermes he never missed my class so this is his nickname is Devon's English teacher and because now you're speaking good English you start to speak good so he tells to Devon that look at Ermes you know he never missed the class it means that you were a very good student that's why you are speaking good and then he's telling Devon to learn as well I think
SPEAKER_01: Top roll for Smart, the nickname. Greetings for Ermes. Dave, incredible match against Vitaly. Question for Ermes. Who is easier opponent for him? Prudnik or Devon? For me? Yeah, which one is for you? Which one would be easier for you? Devon. Devon would be easier for you? Super easy. Super easy, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I understand. And this has Davit has stronger. And these guys are asking funny questions. They're asking you if you were stronger when you had hair, they're asking you there. Yeah. I'm much stronger now. I'm going to say I'm stronger without him. Let's go with that. Yeah. Okay. Another question. This is a good question for you. Were you stronger when you pulled Dennis?
SPEAKER_00: than when you face the one. That's a tough one. I think I was stronger in certain areas. My neck has caused a couple of different injuries over the years. So I was stronger in certain areas when I pulled Dennis. I would say maybe a little bit more in the hook area, I was probably a little bit stronger. But my hand is stronger now. My formation is now a little bit stronger.
SPEAKER_01: yeah in the past you had like kind of like a dragon you know type but now you are all the time going outside outside i think your outside became i mean can you imagine you pulling an outside match against vitalik an outside match against uh alex an outside match against morozo i'm talking about your fresh matches restaurants i mean you you you beat all these guys you know we can
SPEAKER_01: the outside move, you know. Of course, you finished, I think, Lalletin with this pressure, but you brought him to that point with pronation, right? Am I wrong? No, you're right. You're absolutely right. Yes. Let's see. Rafa, who will Dave face next when he beat Ermes? Thank you for your question. No, no. Who will Dave, you, will arm wrestle after you beat Ermes?
SPEAKER_01: they just i must don't get angry with me this is the question before yeah yeah but the first guy first guy asked if okay if i if i win you know i'm like i'm i'm a competitor i would like another shot of levon absolutely um why not why not go for the top one more time
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And did you know that I asked Levan about you and him in Strap? You did or you didn't? I did. Oh, okay. I said, Levan, in the King of the Table, because there was a rule agreement, after a certain time, you know, the match started, you know, remember Devon and Levan? The match directly started with Strap. I said, with the same rules.
SPEAKER_01: Would you pull Dave? He said yes. Well, there you go. There we go, Dave. Here we go. Now you got me going here. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know the result. Maybe he still wins, but I'm sure you will feel more connected. And then I think even if you lose, at least you will enter the match somehow. Yeah, I agree 100%. I'd like to know personally. Absolutely. That'd be fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey.
SPEAKER_01: If he doesn't accept, call me. I have the video proof. Video proof I have. I'll call you. Okay, yeah. Anyways, by the way, I also love Levan. Levan is like a brother to me. Levan is a good dude, real good dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you too, you too. I mean, not Ernaş, but you. Anyway, so I think...
SPEAKER_01: we can finish it is one hour and 15 minutes and i don't want to keep you guys so uh busy again uh you know that this interim interim title match you know right what in interim title um remember i said that this is not a title match remember because jelly has the title yeah remember yeah but people the fans they said that engine
SPEAKER_01: In UFC, when the title owner, the guy who has the title, if they get injured, they cannot pull. And then the other guy pulls with someone at his level for interim title. So this match, you and they will be also for the world title. But it will be two titles now. Like Jerry will also have, you have, you know, when I say you, I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about they.
SPEAKER_01: anyways okay by the way you don't get upset with me okay okay so you you you if you beat dave you will have the helmet now now that that 0.5 is totally gone
SPEAKER_04: no truth we i will have a two two titles yes because i will beat the model two models of two okay yeah yeah yeah but just remember that the helmet i can give one to dave after i beat him thanks i appreciate that thank you so you don't be disappointed but
SPEAKER_01: the helmet is given to you only on the stage. When you go home, you only take the shield. The helmet is going to be given to you permanently. Ah, three times. Three times, yeah. Evgeny the shield is temporary. You will take it, you will bring it. When you win three times, you will have the helmet and the shield permanently. And I think I'm going to make you guys, how do you say that? What's that you put around your neck, you know?
SPEAKER_01: Like a medallion, you know, I think I'm going to make it here for the old title winners. But this medallion, you're going to have it right away when you win, Dave. Yeah. Anyway, so every time you win a title match, you permanently take it home. You don't bring it back. You understand? The medallion. Dave, so
SPEAKER_01: we will expect it to come back again to win another two title matches. And then, yeah, you can permanently have the helmet and the shield, my friend. Sounds good. I'm ready. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. That's good. Look at that. This is going to kill me. We are finished now. Let me check you in a super chat. And do you want to say anything? Last word? Before we finish? Ermes, do you want to say anything? Last word before we finish?
SPEAKER_04: For me, yes, this match, I changed a little bit my mind because with Jari, it's difficult to predict the moment of the match. You understand? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: but here i know chief is more powerful but i'm more confident because i needed to use my power without uh so he is his technique for predictable the way that he pulls is something you are familiar yeah yeah it's not a king move uh flop press like did you understand
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah you have experience about it yeah yeah you need experience for for this i understand yeah this time yeah but with the normal technique yeah yeah anyway so the strongest will win are you are you going to bring um extra luggage for your uh shields
SPEAKER_01: Ah, I love it. Anyway, so one more question. Vinjar, Ruth Holt, Superchat, Dave and Ermes, he's asking, can Denis Siplenko beat Devon Saginashvili? No. No. And you, Dave? Not right now, no. No. No, no, no.
SPEAKER_04: Because he can use the top roll and the hand of Ciplenko is not too much stronger than Levan, I think. If Levan goes immediately in the top roll and he takes the hand of Denis,
SPEAKER_01: I don't think he can. I mean, let's see. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. My personal opinion is, I don't know. The guy is also, I don't know. I don't think that anyone is close to him until someone proves me. But again, as you said, Ermes, it is hard to control him, beat him like this. Maybe an outside move.
SPEAKER_01: far his hand maybe maybe so i don't see dennis is holding him grabbing like low like he does everyone and then just just drag him you know i don't know but they would know better dave is the guy that you know pulled both of them and they said that not right now not right now means that but i understand there was a possibility but we would like to hear from dave
SPEAKER_00: I think if Dennis got back to his, you know, his biggest, strongest shape, he'd definitely have a shot. LeVon's hand is so strong. Obviously, I think LeVon would take him over with the top roll. Now, if Dennis can hold, you know, into his semi-kings move or something like that, still have the side pressure come around, I think Dennis would, you know, have a shot. But I think right now LeVon's hand is just way too strong. It's too powerful right now. So, best of Dennis, best of LeVon. By percentage, how do you see the match?
SPEAKER_01: I would say 60-40, Devon. 60-40, Devon. Do you think that you haven't been pulling so long time, you know, not from early 90s or something, but in your opinion, this guy might be the strongest ever in history? I think so, yeah. I do, yes. Anyways, guys, thank you very much, Dave Chaffee. It was an honor to host you, and it will be an honor to host you in
