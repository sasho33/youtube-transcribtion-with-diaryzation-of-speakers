SPEAKER_00: in four minutes, he should join. I didn't invite any translator. I thought that it would be better if he, hello guys. Hello. Uh, you may see me competing after I start training and getting in shape. I just had stem cells and then I went to workforce as a trainer and then
SPEAKER_00: I got ill, now you can hear from my voice. Thank you guys. And as soon as I will be healthy, that healed up. No, no, no, Mustafa. Devon versus Prudnik is like set for January anyways. I mean, we want to make it happen in November.
SPEAKER_00: But the first match of Devon will be Evgeny Prudnik. Yes, Devon got his stem cells after his match with Levan. Probably about maybe three months ago, probably about three months ago.
SPEAKER_00: sorry guys phone call came you guys hear me stem cells is that they are i mean i had stem cells they are taking they took my fat from belly with the vacuum and
SPEAKER_00: They separated stem cells and then injected. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It will be incredible. It will be incredible. You know, I'm teasing Devon and like friendly provocation. He knows it. Some people think that I hate him or something. They are out of their mind. I will tell you how it happened, how it happened.
SPEAKER_00: yesterday after Michael announced that the match was canceled because he was injured. And Devon is the one who called me. And as soon as he called me, I joke with him. I said, Hey, you know, I already announced your match with Rudnick and Rudnick is gonna make a video, you know, that is gonna, you know,
SPEAKER_00: destroy you or something. And he was like, good, good. And I thought he was joking because I was joking. I mean, there is no way that you know, I would, you know, expect him to replace. And then I realized that he's serious. He's very serious. And I said, Are you serious? And he's like, Yeah, I'm serious. I want to come in. Oh, I'm ready. He said, but there is there are some some things in his
SPEAKER_00: personal life that he needs to fix. And don't, some people are blaming me. Like, how can you invite Devon when it is like less than four weeks away and this and this? No, I didn't ask him. I mean, I would love to ask him and he's not a kid, you know, he can make his own decision. He can say yes, no, whatever. Devon is smart, experienced, knowledgeable enough to make his own decisions, you know? So, but he is the one who really wanted to pull him.
SPEAKER_00: So it is seven o'clock. I don't know where Brody is. I mean, Devon today, he wrote me that his spirit is already in East versus West fight. And he's really working hard to make the things work.
SPEAKER_00: So trust me. I think I'm feeling better. Now I have here a drink type of tea with lemon. It's too hot. I better wait a little bit and waiting for it to come.

SPEAKER_00: I had to go 1 p.m. east, which is 8 p.m. Turkish time. And because Prudnik said that he had to take care of his baby and he can come at 7 o'clock with the Belgian time and 8 o'clock my time. So I came one hour early and I'm like, why did not Prudnik come, you know?

Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.

Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow
SPEAKER_00: Devon, he pulled it or not? Devon, we will soon know. We will soon know. By the way, people on the chat are telling me that Dave Chaffee is watching this interview and he saw you and he just made a public video. He cancelled the match.
SPEAKER_00: I told you not to come with the tank top. I'm joking. My friend, after our live with Jerry, he told me it's better to cancel the match. Oh, it's because he saw you, huh? Yeah. I don't want to post many photos or videos because maybe Jeffrey
SPEAKER_00: Oh, you can't do the same. Okay. So you are saying that during the live chat, he saw you. Yeah. Why he canceled the match. And now listen, you are saying that you don't want to post many videos because you don't want Dave Sheffield to also cancel the match. And then you come in here with a tank top. Why are you doing that? You don't want your t-shirt is tanked up your shoulders. Everything is now seen.
SPEAKER_00: is ski skinny no no no it is very muscular so ah one moment it was better to take a more the long t-shirt yeah yeah i just should put something you show us some bicep that's not bicep that's forearm ah bicep
SPEAKER_00: One moment. Yeah, your forearm, everything is big, yeah. I trained a lot this morning. Yeah, I saw. It's a little... It's not very like a rock, you understand? After the training.
SPEAKER_00: but important my friend is not quality quality my friend quality my friend inside too much quality my thing yeah yeah i understand today when you call me with the video chat i was gonna joke you know i was gonna say that oh why are you getting so skinny what's wrong with you
SPEAKER_00: and then when you really show the arm from the middle i was like it wouldn't be a good joke you know you really look big okay listen are you gonna say the truth or you're gonna be political about your chance against dave my chance remember remember you said that you know like what you think about my chance with david what
SPEAKER_00: One hundred percent. One hundred percent. Oh, no, no. One moment. The life is no. Is it pretty good? Is. Ninety nine. Ninety nine. Why ninety nine? You told me that it would maybe be up the phone up. I don't see half of your head. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe when we come, I'm sick like John Brzezinski. It's difficult to defend. It's impossible to preview what will happen. So you are saying that if you lose,
SPEAKER_00: you will say, oh, I was ill and that's why I lost. No, no. If I lose, if I'm in good shape, good moment, if I lose, he is stronger than me and I don't have any excuse. This is important for the good athlete, good respect and for the good career. So maybe we make a...
SPEAKER_00: We make a poll, Emir. I will make a poll. Let's see what people think, who is going to win you. I see on the polls, people think that Dave is going to beat you. He is like 65% and you are 35%. 35% only? Yeah. See, there is one guy says,
SPEAKER_00: His name is Sam. He says, Chaffee will crush you. It's what he says. My friend, I will do my best. Believe me, he never played the top role like me. Like you, right? No, my friend.
SPEAKER_00: and may reach the formation. In history, has there been any man, any armwrestler who has a top role like you in the whole history? In? In the whole history, is there anyone who had a top role like you? Nobody. Nobody, right? Nobody. So you are the best top roller in the whole armwrestling history, correct?
SPEAKER_00: Come on, just tell us how you think. Tell us how you think. I mean, listen, whatever you have here, whatever you have here. The good technique, because Taras Ivakin very good top roller, but no. Who, who, who? The lady you said? Taras Ivakin. Oh, Taras Ivakin, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: but he is not very, you know, not much control hand, too much brachial radialis and go down like this. I saw Amoris, Janis Amoris, he have the top row like me, because he very smart to
SPEAKER_00: he is like more like yeah like yeah she's more like yeah more or less but i like the top roll about uh for me the best ever top roller is cobra rose you you didn't see him in his prime if you would see in his prime you you would understand yeah yeah he was 75 kilo front of me he top rolled
SPEAKER_00: john's wrist and john then pronated and then they sleep they give a winter yeah and in 1999 love in russia he top rolled uh wakhtang was super overweight and he had many times beat alan carrera yeah yeah nicolas he told me a lot about cobra who said this to you
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he knows it. He knows it. You know, you know, and he told me a lot about Cobra Road. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He was not armresting. He was just like, um, whatever called John Bersink in his prime was about all techniques. You know how smooth if you say that John was doing everything 99 99 99 99.
SPEAKER_00: Cobra wasn't doing hook, not so much side pressure, but the top roll, he was doing hundreds. And Cobra told me that one time John Bersink told him that he is the best top roller, but I don't know when it was, but John also told me that Tarasi Joaquin is very, very, very good top roller. But I think that right now you are also, Minda Agost Tarasaitis is very good top roller. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because the top roll... For the smart people, right? Yes, only for the smart people, but there are people smart and the people a lot smart, too much smart. Oh, okay. The people smart, he can do the top roll, but not perfect top roll, understand? If you are too much smart, you can do the perfect top roll.
SPEAKER_00: And yeah, for the top row, the best way is to take the wrist immediately. No, only this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you take the match, you immediately finish it. Yeah. The people are asking,
SPEAKER_00: What kind of top role do you need to beat Levan? They are asking. And we didn't do the poll yet. Okay, what kind of top role do you need? For Levan. You want to say or you want to keep it secret?
SPEAKER_00: My friend, everybody knows how to put your opponent in a difficult situation. The first part when you use the technique top roll is to open the fingers.
SPEAKER_00: I will attack his finger a lot. Even in the strap? The strap is too much difficult to push with him, like the side pressure or... I think the only way is to open his wrist. Like when he fought with...
SPEAKER_00: Trubin, one time he... I know now he's super double, stronger than... Probably 30% stronger. Yeah, yeah, I know. But I want to... to speak like this for the technique, you understand? Or Badulescu, no, he opened his finger like...
SPEAKER_00: I think this is the only way. In the hook, it's impossible. Impossible to beat him. In the side pressure, it's impossible. Because if Dave Chaffee, when he fought with Levan, maybe he has a little more strong wrist, maybe the match changes.
SPEAKER_00: You understand? Because Jeff is super strong here. First, Jeff is better to go with, like, Ciplenko than Levan. Because Levan, he takes his wrist and Jeff, he couldn't push his 100% power. You understand? With Ciplenko, he could push 100% because he's...
SPEAKER_00: understand arm to arm yeah yeah i mean i mean dave's wrist was more enough for splenco but not for uh levan's back pressure because he he he he pulled him back i mean dennis also is doing but dennis's technique is not like no no and he cannot he has so big hand he's not able to use his hand like so
SPEAKER_00: effectively like like he so he is just holding and he is more like holding and doing arm you know arm arm curl you understand holding yeah yeah yeah that is how it is it's two two different thing to me when lebanese are missing uh other guys it is like uh
SPEAKER_00: a middleweight is arm wrestling a lightweight guy or a heavyweight guy is arm wrestling like a middleweight guy when he's around 180 and you are about 130 kilo of course when you are super heavyweight there is no excuse either you need to go to weight category or you need to not to find excuse oh he's so big or something if he is so big it is so big it's super heavyweight you know then go down yeah yeah yeah yeah but remember
SPEAKER_00: John Brzee, he won with Cieplenko with 45 kilos of difference. 45. But Cieplenko is only quality. You remember, not a lot of fat. When he was 140... Yeah, but it's different, different. You know, like Cieplenko holds like this. No, no, no. It's possible for John to apply his technique and everything.
SPEAKER_00: Whenever you pull someone like Levan, I mean, Levan is very, very, very technical guy. Seriously, people don't understand, but he is very technical. I'm not saying you cannot beat him, but it is very hard thing to do. If Levan was 130, 140 kilo, it could be more possible than how it is now. No?
SPEAKER_00: He told me when he was 190 kilos in the top eight with Ungerbaev. And after this match, he was 165 with Laletin. He told me... He was lighter with Laletin? Yeah. Wow.
SPEAKER_00: He told me he was a lot stronger when he was 165 than when he was 190. Because your body, my friend, if you push too much and the system is not going in the correct way, you understand that.
SPEAKER_00: you need to find your your best best way for the for power for endurance for because because if i want i i i can do to do to go uh 140 kilo if i want but maybe with the fat like these these
SPEAKER_00: my you understand that point you know from 165 to 190 maybe it can be case but when you bring from 165 to 140 135 then that 30 kilo is more yeah yeah from 165 to 190. yeah yeah yeah it will be it will be good yeah and i don't know are you are you excited
SPEAKER_00: For Cefi? Cefi, yeah. Yes. But if you remember, it was one year that I wanted to speak with you to compete with him. Do you remember? No, I don't remember. Yeah, you remember.
SPEAKER_00: people here on the chat because you're because of your italian accent they think that whenever they hear you they get hungry to eat they want to eat probably pizza or spaghetti they want to eat water because because of your italian accent people says that when they hear you talking
SPEAKER_00: they want to eat probably they mean spaghetti or pizza because you are Italian so they remember that, yeah. So can you tell us that you are in your best ever shape in your whole life? Only if maybe yes.
SPEAKER_00: I want to try only one thing because maybe I want to prove my endurance. Maybe now I'm more muscular. I have more muscle, but maybe less endurance. I don't know. But I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah. Say, say.
SPEAKER_00: And surely in the first round, my power now is more than... Yeah, but you just recently had a table training and your endurance felt good or no good? I think I trained my biceps Friday, last Friday.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And then Saturday I trained with my friends. Adrian is an Italian champion, 100 kilos, with two hands like this. How many times, how many sets did you do?
SPEAKER_00: How many, 10 times? 15, 20 times. How was your endurance? Because for you, endurance is important not only with the weights, but at the table. So after 15 times, you felt like you finished or you were still strong? Maybe 70%.
SPEAKER_00: 60, 70 percent. But you are not going to pull Dave 15 times in a row, you know? No, no, no. It's enough three times. Yeah, you need to win three rounds and you will rest between the rounds. Yeah, yeah. But we know he has super power now.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah and if you if you do your maximum only one time is maybe 10 times with my friends you understand it is the same 10 times with my friends with the two hands yeah we see we see i think it will be a very very good fight very good fight because
SPEAKER_00: I think my style with him is good for me. And I don't think he takes my wrist. Yeah, if he takes your wrist, he's going to beat you. Yeah, sure. The only way for you to survive, I don't think he will be able to control your pronators. Yeah, if he takes my wrist, it's really finished.
SPEAKER_00: He is not going to control. And if he takes your wrist, he is going to beat you. And if you both go and then like flat wrist, I still think he has more chance. But if you want to win, you need to control his pronator. If you don't lose, if you don't lose your wrist, I think that you have a chance to win. On the pulse, you know, people were thinking that you are favorite against Jerry.
SPEAKER_00: But against Dave, they think that Dave is favourite. Yeah, because they saw the match with Lalletti. But I think Lalletti now is not in the same shape as when he fought with Levan in the final top eight. I think.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe now the level of the super heavyweight is more than the last two, three years. We don't know. And the question. And if Michael, I mean, not if Michael, I mean, Michael is injured and the match is cancelled. If Devon comes to Istanbul next month,
SPEAKER_00: What's going to happen? If Devon replays Michael and pull against Prudnik next month, what do you think is going to happen? Fantastic match. Fantastic match is a very political answer. What's the prediction?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, I don't know. Because I saw many... I heard in the air... I heard in the air that Devon, he takes the risk of prudence.
SPEAKER_00: so if you had money if you had money you would bet on devon 50 50. oh okay and and and hey we don't know my friend maybe now if devon if devon beats rudnick and if he gets the title would you consider to try
SPEAKER_00: a heavyweight match by going down. I know you are like 127, 128, but you eating spaghetti like crazy. You can easily be 120. Do you think you can beat Devon? Yeah. Very easy, my friend. You gonna say sure? Sure. 100%. Listen, you can beat Devon.
SPEAKER_00: In the super heavyweight or also in the heavyweight as well? Or both? I think 120 kilos is enough. At that weight? If you would mean... In this shape, impossible. Impossible. He cannot. He can't.
SPEAKER_00: If he is in the shape that he pulled Levan and you now, who wins? Me. You? Yeah, easy, my friend. Easy. Okay, which one is more difficult opponent for you? Dave Chaffee or Devon? Are you kidding me? No, no. Why? I mean, is Dave Chaffee or Devon is more dangerous for you? You think?
SPEAKER_00: You think Dave is more dangerous than Dave? I'm not asking. I'm not saying that he is. I'm asking your opinion. You're going to answer, not me. So you are surprised that Engin even asked this question, huh? No, I want to hear what... My friend, now I think...
SPEAKER_00: I think Dave is number two in the world. Because he never lost the first and the second round with nobody. Come on, I don't understand that one. You don't win the Supermatch because you win the first two rounds.
SPEAKER_00: you win the i mean if you go out like that yeah yeah yeah okay but now we have more endurance yeah but when you say more endurance if in dubai when we tell you in uh they pull it was three two four
SPEAKER_00: So it was because it was seven rounds, then they won 4-3. So we cannot say that way, this way, you understand? They won because the rule says that there needs to be seven rounds. But in Istanbul, Morozov just recently won. You can't say this. This is why we are doing best of five, you know what I'm saying? I mean, how would you feel if you would beat
SPEAKER_00: if they is beating you 2-0 and then you come back and beat him 3-2 and then if somebody says david's rank about you wouldn't you say that i beat him 3-2 if you were morozov but the latin are more ranking than other people i mean to be ranked above them i don't know i don't know i don't know my friends
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I don't know. There are too much ranking. We don't know. Yeah, yeah. I have tons of respect for Dave. You know, Dave knows it. But, you know, I mean, it is hard to say number two. I mean, he really, I mean, he had some losses against Gennady and Morozov. I mean, he can pull with them and the next time he can beat them maybe 3-0. I mean, it was that close, that close.
SPEAKER_00: We cannot discredit the other athletes win because we like an athlete a lot. There is a super chat for you. I mean, thank you for your super chat. Hermes versus Davis, perfect matchup. To me, it is 50-50, they say. This is a 50-50 match.
SPEAKER_00: No, Timmy, Dave didn't beat Gerrard. Last match, Gerrard won. Anyway, so... I think if I can stop him in the first round... Dave will destroy Hermes.
SPEAKER_00: what they are saying okay my friend my friends my friends they think i will destroy you and i want to i want to tell you one thing because
SPEAKER_00: Dave is a very great person and I respect him because he pulls with everybody. He pulls with everybody. No scary like, you know, you want to go with him because it's more easy for you or like a snake, you know.
SPEAKER_00: This is a very great athlete for me. Super, super, super. Yeah, Dave is strong in his heart as much as his arm. Dave, I have huge respect for him. Yeah, he's a very nice person, if you don't... Super, super person. And I never see him making excuses.
SPEAKER_00: no no no like even when he lost he says i ran out of gas i need better endurance i will go and train harder i mean like he's just seriously like i mean it is impossible to not uh respect dave yeah it is too hard thank you for your support my friend and the amori show uh thank you for your support my friend
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and you are saying that 50-50, Devon and Prudnik. Yes, because maybe Devon, I think he can take the risk of Prudnik.
SPEAKER_00: But we don't know. Maybe Prudny will go immediately in the top role and he will win immediately. We don't know. But in the hook, I don't think Prudny can beat Devon because of his style of Devon. Prudny cannot get Devon in the hook? No. Oh, okay. But if he gets, he will win, right? If you catch him in the hook. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: If you are very, very close, his side, the winning position, yes. But I don't know if maybe he can put his shoulder, you know, when he has a big position in the hook. But in the hook, Prunik is very strong, super strong.
SPEAKER_00: For me, the best way for him is to go in the top row, take his wrist and continue, continue, continue to go to the victory. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it will be an incredible match, but we will see. I saw the comedy of Broodnick.
SPEAKER_00: for Michael Todd when he broke everything. I laughed many times. Yeah, it was incredible. Crazy. It's like a circus, man. Yeah, yeah. I was like, wow. He was like so psychopath. You know, he's breaking everything and he's saying
SPEAKER_00: oh what did i do sorry michael i'm sorry you never see that i mean i was like what is he doing you know just i i would never expect him to uh before maybe you should just him to do this
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, no, no. Another level. Another level. It is like a horror movie, you know. He's just like... I mean, it wasn't normal, you know, what he did was not normal. He's just... Guys, I will share the link if you want to sign T-shirt link for the East vs. West
SPEAKER_00: Levan Saginacvili will sign, and Denis Tchipenko will sign, and all the athletes who are participating will sign. Hermes will sign as well. If no signature, no money. No money. Me? Me, me.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, it's cramping, right? Yeah, why? It's because you train so hard today. What did you train today? Yeah, it's just because it's tired, tired. It's cramping. It's normal. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I train a lot. Yeah, yeah. There are some super chats. Quickly, I will read them. And then...
SPEAKER_00: I don't transplant hair. You need or me? No, no, me, me. Ah, you have. The people go to me to talk. He don't have a hair. Look that one. How many hair? There is a question for you. Would Hermes beat Alex Kurdecha now?
SPEAKER_00: Who? Would you now, could you beat him, Alex, if you would pull him now? You ask him for replacement. No, I'm not asking. People are asking on the chat. Yeah, but you ask Alex for replacement for me. But he don't want. Oh, it is not because he doesn't want to pull you. It is because he said he made his plans for
SPEAKER_00: January. My friend, I repeat many times, when I fought with Alex, I don't want to make an excuse, but this is the reality. I underestimated him too much, too much. And it was a very big mistake. And I was 118, 119 kilos like this.
SPEAKER_00: i am 10 kilo more you know is a big difference my friend thank you more of my master good master and weight make difference okay huh so weight makes difference yeah if a good master yeah yeah and uh 10 kilo more is completely different and uh
SPEAKER_00: I pull it with him in the bedroom like this. I know there are no competitions like this. But sometime in the future, maybe you guys will pull again. I think if I can do the good things with
SPEAKER_00: Dave Chaffee is enough for response to many, many questions. You understand? I understand. This is insulting your question. I'm not going to read this. Sorry about that for your £5. Please make sure that you don't insult anyone when you ask question.
SPEAKER_00: morris moritz geister geister whatever thank you for your super chat hermes why are you scared of devon i'm scary they think that you are afraid of them is it true no i'm afraid it's not uh it's not true this uh answer oh okay this question
SPEAKER_00: No, I want to pull with Devo. When he wants, no problem. I think they just want to provoke you. Thank you for your super chat. I think if they used Prest against Morozov and Gennady like he did with Vitaly, he would have won. Yeah. It's just different, different because especially the last rounds, you know, they hook him. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah another way it's not the same as like you know like but still you know maybe he could just do with even shoulder pressure in hook yeah but you know it is good that he tried something that we didn't expect and it was successful it was incredible match it was incredible match yeah anyway so i i have okay i will ask you uh now when
SPEAKER_00: when we know that, I mean, there's a possibility that until now we had four East versus West, and even probably the best team of the West was like, I cannot say the best team, but the strongest, like everyone thought that they had the advantage against the East.
SPEAKER_00: It was in the May event, East versus West three, but they, are you gone? Okay. Okay. Big Grow Golds. Thank you for your super chat. Hermes, what does John Bersink mean to you?
SPEAKER_00: and the sport of armwrestling. Okay. There is a question for you, Hermes. Yeah. Big glow goals. Thank you for your support. Hermes, what does jumbo zinc mean to you and the sport of armwrestling? I also like that you continue to improve your English. They say that your English is getting better and better and they like this.
SPEAKER_00: But what do you think about John Brzezinski? What do you think? What does John Brzezinski mean to armwrestling world and to you? He's my hero, my friend. Yeah. This world is enough for a sponge. When you grow up, you were inspired by him, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: My technique is not the same as John Bruce's. Everybody has a different technique. But he said a lot of times in interviews like this, if you have a strong technique,
SPEAKER_00: and you are stronger in one technique, it's better to train, train, train this technique. Many techniques and you don't have, you understand, too much power. I understand, yeah. I mean, people like John, they had incredible genetics. They could just, I mean, for me especially, I really didn't have so good one.
SPEAKER_00: And I tried to develop a technique to make the least mistake, not to make the mistake, understand? The same way I had a very strong hand when I was young and healthy. And yeah, it is very, very hard to be super good in every technique, in hook, in side pressure, deadlifts. Yeah. For me, it's impossible to have the same side pressure like
SPEAKER_00: Like Dave Chaffee. Yeah, but you don't have to have the same. You still need to have the same. Yeah, yeah. And maybe Levan, he has a totally stronger technique. Maybe him. But we don't know because in the future you will see a lot.
SPEAKER_00: many, many things. For me, John Brzee in the top row is not stronger than when he pulls. Maybe I won't, I don't know. But his top row is not good like when he hooks. You understand? When he uses the hook technique.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I agree. I don't understand his top row, you know, because he uses a lot of his form like this, you know, with straps. Yeah, yeah. But if he don't use a lot of his fingers, wrist, you understand what I mean? Yeah, yeah. But it wasn't like that all his career. When you get a little bit older and the signals coming quite late to your hand,
SPEAKER_00: and then you are more dependent on strap, more dependent on pronator when you are getting older, you understand? But when he was young, he was more dominant with hand wrist and, you know, he was doing full hand. Ah, you mean when you are older, you change? Yeah, yeah, yeah. His hand is not like when he was young. Maybe his arm, everything is okay now, but the hand is getting less signal from the brain. There are so many problems, you understand?
SPEAKER_00: And your brain cells, the reaction, everything, the control. So his wrist is not like when he was young. He had much better hand and wrist when he was young. If you ever come to age of 58, you will understand what I'm saying. I mean, I didn't get to 58. I'm 48. I already have the signal problem.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, my father, too. Yeah, he have his two finger without that, since he don't feel the touch. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And this one here in the in the elbow is blocked. Yeah. O.D. James.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you for your super chat, my friend. Who does Hermes think should be the main event? Him versus Dave or Devon versus Evgeny? Which one do you think that he's thinking that, you know, should be the main event? You and Dave or Devon and Evgeny? Or do you even care about it? I think it should be the main event. I understand.
SPEAKER_00: But after Jerry got injured, that match is not anymore the title match. Why? Because Jerry has the title. Emma, you give me another...
SPEAKER_00: Another title, my friend. Hey, my friend, I don't come if you don't give me the helmet. Why would I give you the title? My friend. Why would I do that? Call Jerry to send the helmet here. You call him, you call him. I call him later.
SPEAKER_00: Look at that. His question caused so much problems now here. My friend, I don't come if you don't give me the hand if I win. Of course you will come. It's the title match. Jerry is the champion. You need to be here. No, my friend. He will do everything. He is better. He sends everything. Okay, call him. Call him. If he sends you, I will give it to you. I promise.
SPEAKER_00: My friend, you are the organizer, not me. You are the organizer. How can I take the title from him just because he hurt his shoulder? It's not my problem and not your problem, my friend. I mean, the injury... He's not going to be away for one year. He's going to be away for three months, you understand?
SPEAKER_00: An example, if I have the title and I don't compete for five years... No, not five years. In January he's going to compete. If you want, you can pull him. It's up to you. My friend, I cannot take the title away from him just because his shoulders... If I win, who do you give me? What do I give you?
SPEAKER_00: you extra money my friend extra money if you don't give me a hand this is the guy that is causing me problems all the time thank you my friend these guys are the ones that are the best
SPEAKER_00: whenever they see me they are looking at me oh this is atm machine this guy caused problems you know okay living niles hints thank you for your superjet oh again you are saying work well in 70s for the arthritis okay my friend thank you wish the blue is coming who thinks putting can be zelensky on the table um
SPEAKER_00: Thank you for super chat and thank you for your good wishes, my friend, about the second part is too political. We don't want to get in there. And Jovica Markowski, thank you for your super chat. Current top five in the world, according to Hermes, including people in order. Hermes, who are the top five? Including you.
SPEAKER_00: No, I'm not in top 10, my friend. Come on. If I look at your ranking, I'm like 15th. No, it is not you. You know, now that ranking, I'm a second. Your ranking, I'm a 10. It is not 10 or something. You just need to beat someone, you know. What can I do? You need to, the last time you pulled Arif Ertem,
SPEAKER_00: and then you beat bortalato left arm and then gennady when he was not oh my friend if i if i give you opinion i would rank you somewhere else but by the results of the east versus west yeah if you would be jerry you were taking number one
SPEAKER_00: now if you with dave you're gonna rank the ranking of the the world ranking or the of the east person west i mean the guy is asking you what is your opinion about the world ranking top five i know number one is yeah yeah number one is levan and you are thinking that you are number two i'm sure right come on you don't need to laugh you cannot think it different you are not gonna say
SPEAKER_00: Oh, you just said that Dave was number two in the world. Oh, you mean that Dave is stronger than you. I understand now. Okay. Tell me top five. Leiva. Second place.
SPEAKER_00: Believe me, now I think Dave Chaffee. Okay. Okay, I understand. Now, this time without any, you understand, without any... Okay, you are basically saying that Dave Chaffee is going to beat you 25 days later. No, no, no, my friend. Okay, I understand. Because he pulled one month ago and he took a big win.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, one month ago, how can Laletin was number two when Zaur beat him, when Ferit beat him? No, my friend, this is not correct. What do you mean? What's not correct? Zaur is strong, but if you want to see a good fight, it's better to put in a super match with five rounds or six rounds.
SPEAKER_00: In the competition, it's difficult to see who is stronger. Because Naledi, he pulled it the first two, three times with Shelyaev. And you know you lose a lot of power if your opponent is strong, very strong. And after this, he loses with Zhao. Maybe he loses two. No.
SPEAKER_00: Zaur was better than everyone there. Anyway, so, okay, you are saying number two is Dave. Okay. Now, number three. Number three. I think...
SPEAKER_00: Revas or me. So you are saying that Revas is going to beat Morozov 25 days later? Yeah. Yeah. If he will come with a very good shape. He is coming with very good shape. He leverage with a very strong wrist is very dangerous for Morozov.
SPEAKER_00: the hook no i think the hook he will lose but if she started with he he he have a good fight i know i don't know three four years ago with the lebanon you remember yeah there is one guy saying jace hermes is not joking hearing it um
SPEAKER_00: Five place, Morozo. Morozo, wow. No Vitaly? You said that if Vitaly was in second place, then how did Dave Chaffee come to the second place? I forget. If Vitaly was second place after Dave beat him, he should go down. I forget. Fourth place, Vitaly.
SPEAKER_00: Third place, Vitaly? Fourth. And you and Rewaz is third? Yeah. And then don't you think that if you're third, Rewaz should be fourth. If Rewaz is three, you should be fourth. So, Laletin should be fifth, not fourth. Right? Now, for me, it's fourth. Laletin. Okay, but who is three?
SPEAKER_00: me and the reverse you cannot be three you can either you three there was four or reverse three you are four if you both are for three and then the next place should be fifth place because there are four guys already up there ah okay reality in five okay 95 will be tomorrow also and it knows aura no okay no
SPEAKER_00: I don't know who is this level. If he fights with someone like top five, we will see. But you can put the ranking only if you compete. You understand? I understand. Yeah. Let's see. Let's see how it will be.
SPEAKER_00: My friends, it's very difficult to follow the rank because there are Gennady, there are Rudnik, many people. That's why I organize so many matches and we see who is where, you know. It's very difficult. Very, very difficult. And where is this guy, Rudnik? Now it's 8 o'clock and I can't believe that I started everything in one hour.
SPEAKER_00: uh before can you read the chat do you see the chat or not on the internet no no right maybe maybe just one second i will disappear just to check prudnik um i i will come in 10 minutes okay i prepare for eating another meal my friend okay wait five minutes five minutes

SPEAKER_00: I already sent to Devon. I said, if you feel, you know, to join, just you're more than welcome. And I think Gary's injury is not super, super terrible. I think he will be ready for January. He was going to get the results today, MRI results. And now Prudnik is coming. And somebody, Maurice Geisler,
SPEAKER_00: And you really bring us out to eat super much in East versus West. My friend, I would really would like to, I would, I would like to, um, but, um, um, what for the federation, which is Turkish Federation is a member. They don't allow me.

SPEAKER_00: you only made a video and he got only i made the video and he got injury without him yeah yeah he he saw and got injury without my touch oh only i made the video only and what what would happen if you would touch him he would be even more injured
SPEAKER_02: but uh i don't know i think it's good for him that i didn't touch him uh i think it's good for him oh okay okay so you can you can uh
SPEAKER_00: dream about what's happened with him if i touch him if i pull ah okay okay okay so let me let me see if i get correct you're saying that you made the video and then by watching the video he already got injured and you are saying that imagine what would happen if you would arm wrestle to him okay yeah okay let's see what michael will say about it yeah it's it's
SPEAKER_00: The video that you made, you are out of your mind. I was like, this guy is psychopath. I thought you're a psychopath. How did you figure out the video that you break everything and then you are saying, oh, I'm sorry, Michael. I'm sorry. Oh, what did I do? What did I do?
SPEAKER_00: i was like wow what is this you know your your acting level and everything you're i mean is incredible and then you come to camera and you're like you didn't see that you didn't see it yeah and the part that you are like you know michael hey i was like you know it is like a horror movie you know yeah yeah yeah you're psychopathic
SPEAKER_00: yeah that is that is um yeah there are some super chats and all the james evgeny who should be the main event you and devon or ermis and dave ermis says it should be him um some of these guys are gonna put me in trouble uh by this question so that he is asking you what should be the main event if devon larat comes to istanbul what should be the main event you versus devon or ermis versus dave
SPEAKER_00: They asked the same question to Hermes. Hermes said this is a super heavyweight match, so he and Dave should be the main match. How do you think about this? You mean what is the most important match? No, no, no. What is the most important match?
SPEAKER_00: if if Devon comes Istanbul which one is more important match Devon versus you or Dave versus Hermes which is more important important for him for important no no like important for the event which is the most important of course me with Devon why you ask why you asking
SPEAKER_02: I don't know who he is. Oh, you don't even know who he is. I don't remember who he is. But you will remember him if someday he becomes very popular. Maybe someday. Maybe later, okay. Maybe. I forgot.
SPEAKER_00: This is Jovica Markowski. Engin, do you think Jerry had more chance against Hermes or Dave? My friend, I really don't know that before they pulled. But with Dave, Hermes knows what to expect. With Jerry, he didn't know what to expect. But it doesn't mean that Jerry had more chance or something. So I don't know. Only table would answer that. But mentally, Jerry match was...
SPEAKER_00: uh harder mentally because i don't think anybody ever pulled someone like jerry before yeah and and do you think that do you think that uh prudently is there anyone in north america in your weight category that uh can beat you in your weight category from north america cool i don't think i don't think anyone uh
SPEAKER_02: uh can't beat me in my weight anyone in the world in the world the world yeah but if somebody for example devon has a balls to face me and he can come and try pull with me and i am uh
SPEAKER_00: Teach him the difference between training and competition. You know? Okay, okay, okay. So you are saying that you are not only the best in, like nobody can beat you from North America, but you are saying that nobody in the world can beat you in your category? Yeah. And then you say, and then if Devon what? If Devon what? If Devon has balls, you said? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Can I ask Devon now? Devon, do you have enough balls to face me? Are you going to go? Double two. Do you have enough balls to face me, Devon? And then what did you say that you are going to teach him?
SPEAKER_00: yeah i didn't understand difference between the training training and the competition oh i understand i understand i understand um that's funny funny your your your your level of this
SPEAKER_00: the competition challenge is just like out of my imagination. You know, your level is different level. I was thinking that I was thinking that you would be maybe like a little bit, a little bit scared of Devon, but now you are saying that if Devon has enough balls to face you and you're going to teach him the difference between training and the competition, that that is a big challenge.

SPEAKER_00: Do you like him? I think you all should do some videos. I don't know what kind of videos he's talking about, but like you all are joking, he says, but Devon thinks that you are great. Devon thinks that you are great. Me too, my friend. Same word for Devon. Yeah. Do you like him? They are asking if you like him. I respect him a lot, yes. But sometimes we have a video chat, sometimes for speech.

SPEAKER_00: If there are, if the people respect everybody, there are no problems. I understand. And, and, um, Brittany, a question for you. If, if Devon accepts to come here, um, are you worried about the mental game of Devon or it's no problem for you? Uh,
SPEAKER_00: only about pay-per-view because i need more more uh people yeah but but he's not only doing pay-per-view he likes to also have mind control on his opponents he likes to intimidate you he likes to confuse you are you afraid that he will be no no no you think and are you afraid that at the table he will be doing some you know
SPEAKER_00: Before the match starts, you know, he's doing all kind of things. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I do this too. Yeah. Okay, okay. I can do this too. But just remember, just remember. But just remember, this guy has incredible endurance. If you do this and give power, your hand will be pumped before the match starts. No, I train him.
SPEAKER_00: without pump oh you can do without pump yeah okay and the question you said you didn't really arm wrestle him to win you said you found the weak points with him um did you find yeah but i uh you are not gonna tell don't don't don't tell yeah i understand
SPEAKER_00: and just honestly what is your chance percentage with devon honestly my or uh what what i think we will know his as well hermes with steve chippy no no you and devon uh
SPEAKER_02: okay i play for devon and uh to say uh 65 uh 35 yeah who has more chance me yeah but when you said that you when you pulled michael you said 50 50. now you say 65 35. so you think more than just it it was uh later yeah
SPEAKER_00: had a few power. Oh, now you are strong. Now you are strong. Oh, okay. But if Michael would come 25 days later, what would be your chance against Michael? 80-20. 80-20. Against Devin? 65-35. And against Ermes? What then? I'm asking his chance against you.
SPEAKER_00: brooding with me yeah him 85 percent you 85 no him and you 15. okay yeah okay and what do you think how you think i don't understand
SPEAKER_00: If you put Hermes on Hermes, what is your chance? With me? Hermes with me? Yeah. Eighty-five percent. Eighty-five. So you both agree about it. You listen. I understand. There is a super chat. Ivan says you can see strength in his arm through the screen.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know which one of you is talking about, but, um, they, he says that he, thank you for your super chat. He can see the power even through the, or maybe he's talking about both of you. And there is another super chat proving astrology. Rudnick, will we see you pull Michael Todd when he's healthy? Will you pull Michael Todd when he heal up, when he's healthy in the future or not? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: will pull him yeah i i uh i won't yeah um you already have one win to defend the title you beat hutchings and now you have if you pull larat you have larat and then if you beat larat you have michael so if you win three matches you're gonna have the the title and helmets and the shield permanently
SPEAKER_00: and if you can do that this is going to be incredible job because the guys that you would be facing is tatashins devonara and michael todd it would be incredible if you can beat them let's see let's see what are you eating non-stop hermes what are you gonna be 140 kilo look at my mask for it every time

SPEAKER_00: It will be interesting. It will be interesting. And I don't know. And how do you see, honestly, not joking, how do you see Dave Chaffee and Hermes? I think Hermes has more chance.
SPEAKER_02: more chance because uh he has a start start but you you see you saw uh him fight with lalitin i don't know what's happened with lalitin if he's stronger like early then chafee now is very very very
SPEAKER_02: good form and good stamina because you you saw how it it was uh seven round and cheffy pull pull pull early cheffy uh lost position uh after second round you know and now
SPEAKER_02: he keep in position, he lost wrist, but he keep position seven round. Seven round, it's good stamina now. I think Jay Chiffey catch, catch secret, catch case for him power. Do you think Leleitin is strong same when he fought with Levan?
SPEAKER_02: now stronger huh now a little stronger more stronger than when he fought with levan well yeah but uh he now more lost he more loose uh has more loose do you think he's the same power than when he fought with levan same power same yeah
SPEAKER_02: i don't know no more down i don't know i think uh less less because he lost uh yeah because he lost uh he lost uh silayev he lost paul zulayev he lost more power yeah
SPEAKER_00: but uh laden has a great start and this this start don't help him yeah if you don't have a power if you ever start don't change it i think he has power but i think dave chappie was stronger that is we don't need to take away anything matt murphy i'm sorry pat murphy apple pie for dessert are you eating apple pie

SPEAKER_00: um important is you give me a lot of money and this for me is okay is it enough for you no no i don't know i thought i i thought you had dreams now what are you calling hey demo
SPEAKER_00: Hey, buddy, listen, I can't talk. I'm just going into a meeting. What's going on? Anything urgent? Turn to me. Turn to the camera. Look there. Turn to the camera. Up, up. Hello, Devin. Hello. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm breaking the law, and I'm late. I'm late for my meeting.
SPEAKER_00: I am even more merciful than you are. You wake me up 3 a.m. in the morning. You see that man here, sitting there? One moment. I am prepared for you. I'm late, man. I'm fucking late for this meeting I'm supposed to be at. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: i gotta let you guys go i gotta let you guys go okay okay uh i'm saying i'm thinking about east versus west every day believe me i'm trying my best but the problem is that you europeans are also scary and i'm afraid to lose okay so this is what we were talking about this is what we are exactly saying we knew that you are scared and we already knew that you are gonna find an excuse and not to come here
SPEAKER_04: That's the thing. You see, the thing that you guys need to understand is it's okay for me to lose to guys like LaVon or like Dennis. That's no problem because everybody expects. But when I lose to somebody like Prudnik, oh!
SPEAKER_00: Do you hear me? said that he is asking if you have enough of balls to come to Istanbul.
SPEAKER_02: what he said yeah balls yeah i don't i don't i i'm scared i'm scared to come i might maybe if somebody pays me enough money raise the camera yeah you can only lose
SPEAKER_04: Come and pull with me. I didn't even know you were there. Hey, listen, you were too strong in practice for me. I don't know if I want to pull you anymore. You'll have your answer in 24 hours. What do you think, Gene?
SPEAKER_02: He change passport and go in other country. In Africa. They have grown up. There is question, Mika. What is that magic chair, Prudnik? Prudnik, is that a magic chair, magic?
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah for uh grow hair in my back deep pocket they win first and second rounds hermes takes the next four rounds but it's best of five my friend last six rounds so hermes they are saying that thank you for your support dave is gonna win
SPEAKER_00: round one, round two, and then you're going to win the rest. That's what they say. The important is the victory, my friend. Yeah. But it's possible to change with six rounds. Why? Because I want to win 6-0. No. No. 3-0 is the maximum you can do. I have a question for you.
SPEAKER_00: For who? For you, Andy. Okay. Okay, okay, one second, one second. First of all, I'm not going to pay you more money, if this is the question. And the second of all, I'm not going to give you the title, because Jerry has the title. If you have different questions, you can ask. First of all? First of all... I don't...
SPEAKER_00: i was just joking joking okay okay tell tell i don't understand nothing yeah i don't understand repeat for me i don't understand nothing but why you don't give the opportunity to pull the fourth and the five match oh
SPEAKER_00: it is it is do you know why um so you are saying the full five rounds yeah yeah maybe we should but only if i make the event less matches because even now too much longer yeah yeah but after uh maybe the main event is the main event is i mean no but no if i change i will change for everything you know but
SPEAKER_00: Next year I plan to do 10 matches and if I do 10 matches then I will probably change to full five rounds instead of because maybe after 3-0 somebody is beating somebody then you want to try maybe hook maybe you want to try something. Because if you pull only for the victory maybe
SPEAKER_02: they pull only in his technique, but maybe the people want to see in another position, you understand, who is stronger, like this. Ramesh, can you pull with Dave without wrist? Yes, it's my first technique, my first. Flop, press, like this. You can do this with Dave. Dave? With Dave, you can do this.
SPEAKER_00: Cadoret teach me. Every day I call him to teach. It's a good way to beat Cefi. I don't know about that. Or in the hook, defensive hook. Deep. Not in the winner position. Defensive hook. It's a good way to beat David Cefi.
SPEAKER_00: When are any of you going to come here to a USA tour? Thank you for your super chat. Jesse is asking, when are you guys going to America for a tour? Maybe. Do you know what we can do? Maybe.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe I will go in December. Maybe. Maybe. I don't know if I can tell you. I understand. But maybe one day we all together go somewhere. All together? Yeah, yeah. Nice.
SPEAKER_00: Las Vegas. Las Vegas. Okay, why Las Vegas? Because... That's a city. Las Vegas is Sin City. Sin? What is it? You know, in there, the cities have some names, you know, like nicknames. As far as I remember, I competed there. It was a Sin City. It was called. Everywhere I go, there was those
SPEAKER_00: There are good parties for us after the competition. Gambling machines, you know, there's gambling machines everywhere. You go restaurant, gambling machine. You go restroom, there's a gambling machine. Those, you know, I don't know, block machine or something, you know, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In Las Vegas, there are a lot of competitions, MMA, boxing. Okay, we go and watch for UFC.
SPEAKER_00: No, no. If you want to, you organize an event in Las Vegas. Oh, okay. East versus West? In Las Vegas. Okay. It's possible, no? Yeah, anything is possible. Yeah. We can talk about it in Istanbul while you and Prudnik sign in t-shirts. Then we can talk about it. It will be very funny.
SPEAKER_00: Or it's very beautiful, my friend, in Rome, inside the Colosseum. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Try to think the competition. Ah, again, inside the Colosseum, the table in the center, you enter like a gladiator. And, Hermes, I talked already with Claudio Rizza
SPEAKER_00: yeah and i said i i may do uh east versus west qualification event in italy maybe qualification what do you mean i mean i will do tournaments like categories and the winner i will probably give chance to compete at the east versus west
SPEAKER_00: And the winner of each category or the winner of the winner of the each category, I will give them a chance to compete at East versus West. Maybe we can even do East versus West in Italy and tournament as well. Maybe one day tournament. Maybe next day is the. Yeah, because I like Claudio. Claudio is very, very nice person. Yeah, we can. And he have many contact here.
SPEAKER_00: and a very good place to... And you want to... I want to set you with Prudnik in Italy. Supermatch with Prudnik. But maybe you pull Prudnik somewhere else. You don't want to lose in front of the Italians. You wouldn't want that.
SPEAKER_00: I don't understand. What do you mean? You lose in Italy. Yeah, I lose in Italy. I mean, I want to set you with Prudnik, supermatch, but in Italy, I said, but then I thought it's no good idea because you don't want to lose front of Italian people, you know, to Prudnik. It would be better to go in Belgium or in Ukraine.
SPEAKER_00: beat him there you will beat him there yeah let's go with the ukrainian in the in the t-shirt signing room this time there will be dennis he will sign t-shirt and there will be
SPEAKER_00: the one moderators if you have the uh link can you please uh post the link of the t-shirt every athlete will sign the t-shirt official t-shirt and also dennis and levon will sign the t-shirt if devon comes devon also will sign the t-shirt and we will cover the shipment we will send you and then it's 100 if you donate um imagine that in the same room dennis is there

And then in the final, he beat Klivdine once and then Klivdine beat him again. But in 95, John Burzink went down to middleweight, 90 kilos. And in the super heavyweight, he beat Klivdine, Jerry Cadoret, all of them he beat, Rambet.
SPEAKER_00: And in 96, he also, there was no Clive Dean, he beat Jerry Cadoret in the final. 95, 96, on this earth, there was nobody that could beat Gervais. How old is he now? Probably, maybe late 50s, maybe late 50s. 50 years old? I mean, 55, 56, I don't think it's 60, but I don't... What?
SPEAKER_00: John Brzenk, 58. Yeah, John Brzenk, 58. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And, you know, he was also MMA fighter, you know, he was a UFC fighter, yeah. And there is one question. Sorry, yeah, Kirsten Rodigi. Thank you, my friend. Thank you, brother. Keep it up. And you are doing an amazing job. Can't wait to see Hermes versus Dave and Matt Mask to Sanderis.
SPEAKER_00: A very beautiful match. Yeah, Sanderis also was super good at the WAF. Sanderis was very strong. Yeah, but Matt Maaske is very smart in the top row. And there is Bruce... In the top. Thank you for your support. Long leverage.
