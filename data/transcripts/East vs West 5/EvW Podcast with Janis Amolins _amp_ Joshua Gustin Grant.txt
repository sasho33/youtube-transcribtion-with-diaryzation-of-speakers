SPEAKER_01: hello hello hello how are you oh thank you fine fine um is it possible that you turn on sideways just to have more room on the screen like this yeah thank you that's better we are live
SPEAKER_01: okay yeah joshua you know joshua augustine grant yeah yeah i know joshua yeah yeah he will also join us uh-huh good how are you how are you tired very tired tired i i see you doing uh live streams some youtube youtube chat almost i think every day and
SPEAKER_00: and a lot of other things a lot of other things of course of course of course but uh i i know that you love arm wrestling and i know that you like uh live in arm wrestling but still uh in one point it could be could be too much and like a little overdue it's too much but you know um one of the reasons that you know we don't uh we had been you know or have been you know successful is that we don't give up
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's just part of the process. And once you started something, and a lot of people are waiting for you to do something good, then there is no return, you know.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, absolutely. And also for you, that you wanted everything to be in good standard, in high standard, and everything is fine and good. And of course, understandable. But yeah, it's always a question how much you can handle. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, when I was young, I wasn't this experienced about life, about things. But I was stronger physically and maybe even mentally.
SPEAKER_01: Now I have more knowledge, but less power. Same thing about our investing as well. It's similar. So you have to spend your energy smarter, yes? I mean, yes, but whenever you're trying to do something without calculating if it is
SPEAKER_01: more than what i can handle and or not you know then then then you start and then you realize after that you know that you know it's very hard but again you know because because here is still thinking that you know is limitless you know my name in turkish and in english it means boundless boundless yeah and and and like no limit you know boundless but um but
SPEAKER_00: I have. I mean, when I was young, I was feeling that way. Now I'm feeling very, very limited here. Yeah, it's usually usually the thing is that maybe, maybe, maybe not even maybe not even like physically you get tired of all this. I think it's more like mentally like doing something, some same thing over and over and over. It's maybe tougher than physically. Yeah, but that's stress.
SPEAKER_01: that stress is also affecting you physically. You understand? Like, when you are here and then your body is also not super good. I don't know. I mean, like... Hello, hello. Okay, Joshua is here as well. Good morning, good evening. Good morning, probably, for you. Afternoon, it's noon. Afternoon, okay. Good afternoon. I think it is five minutes to noon, 11.55. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah so how have you been joshua great man i mean uh actually yannis you've inspired me the last couple weeks i've been watching your videos again and i started doing a lot more bodyweight exercises on uh just every morning because i haven't been doing those to the same extent over the last year just like the arm wrestling training so i feel like i was just watching you and i was just thinking like the the amount of attention you give to the
SPEAKER_04: like lesser muscles in terms of the arm wrestling stuff. I feel like it's got to increase your overall power level. And so I'm experimenting with it. I've been doing it for like three weeks. And again, I haven't really done stuff like that for a while because I've been focused on just like the climbing and the arm wrestling exercise that both of you guys have worked with me on. I think that especially off season, we need to focus on general strength and health and everything. And then specific should come
SPEAKER_01: later later whenever coming closer then we should be more specific i mean when i was young it could be all the time specific but but after the point no way
SPEAKER_00: absolutely yeah it's it's it's not like uh you you should you should cut like a specific arm wrestling exercise at all but uh a percentage usually is like uh when it's more far away from competition or after competitions and this general training or a general exercise should be more and it's getting closer and it's always getting more specific and you still need some general but not so much and about body weight of course it's great but
SPEAKER_01: i think main main like uh best benefit is like difference always it's good if you can can do something different and anything is good anything is working but not not forever yeah all right anyway so we have a competition that is coming very soon almost like eight days eight days later at this time we will be
SPEAKER_01: about to start the competition like like last one minute yes no two minutes eight days later two minutes later you know after eight days and then then then then neil will be ladies and gentlemen yeah it's exciting yeah you always do it and get every card is better than the last one i keep thinking there's no way you're going to be able to make a better one but just because of like
SPEAKER_01: luck and chance and injuries, all of a sudden you have this incredible card again. I do my best sometimes. I mean, I'm only responsible to do my best and then whatever result comes this time, the result is like this next time may not be as good, but still, you know, I mean, we, we should, I don't understand. I mean, I think we should not focus on every, every event that, you know, like, I mean, I, I do my best, whatever result comes.
SPEAKER_01: what it is, you know, I mean, I don't have like, I mean, it's not only up to me as well, you know, Atlas needs to be available, Atlas needs to, they need to accept the offer, you know, so I just do my best. So people should not expect that, you know, like it should be forever going, you know, to different level, you know, but I mean, every event is good, you know, every event doesn't have to have all these matches. And there are one thing I think I proved,
SPEAKER_01: And I'm sure Yannis would agree that a lot of not super famous guys are involved. And now they are known even by the, like for example, I will tell you, Yannis, for many years, I was very...
SPEAKER_01: i would say i i was i was involved with social media if you remember that uh northeast message board yes yes of course you know i was very world of arm wrestling you know and then i kind of stopped for some years and then whenever i come back during the pandemic then i saw that arm wrestling you know fan base grew a lot and then whenever i come back probably i can say five percent of the
SPEAKER_01: the people knew about me. Whenever I start talking and they're like, who are you? That, you know, how are you talking? You know, like, what are you? Who are you? You know, at the beginning, there was like a lot of reactions like that, that then, then later they get to know when the other people talk about me. Oh, okay. This is some guy I think knows about arm wrestling. So it is, it is the same about many of the Eastern pullers that were not known by the, uh, the, the big arm wrestling fan base.
SPEAKER_01: that mostly knew about some of the pale guys and some of the wild guys, but not so much the guys from the WAF. While you and I especially, we know that most of the top guys of today came from WAF.
SPEAKER_00: Hermes came from WAF, Lewand came from WAF, Rewas came from... Almost everyone. I don't know who from armorslaves who are competing in East-West, who has never been competed even in WAF. I think everyone does. Everyone does. Everyone, maybe like Tata Ching and some other guys. Okay, don't... Dave, even John, even Ryan Bowen has competed in WAF, so I think everyone else...
SPEAKER_01: probably probably catching his only example yeah alex kudashev will come he didn't compete and maybe maybe a few other guys you know like uh american guys maybe didn't come with some of them i remember even even uh corey miller competed 2008 or not 2000 2010 in usa he did in 70 kilo glass oh he did too yeah yeah yeah and anyway so what i just tried to say that so
SPEAKER_01: my intention was to show the world that you know there are a lot of people but who didn't have chance to pull at this level so now i mean many people knows about you know this guy so that is i don't know where the subject
SPEAKER_00: come yeah but but did if i can if i can say about that is it it's not the only arm wrestling it's similar another any other sport in boxing or so on right now often we see that uh not always best athletes get some best fights but sometimes some uh i don't know louder mouses or or some
SPEAKER_00: some some who are more social active get some better fights and and we see kind of similar situation right now in arm wrestling as well not always best guys or maybe best athletes who who really deserve to have some uh some some some some spotlight in a in arm wrestling they're not always getting best fights but it is how it is for funds and for for for entertainment it's anyway great yeah yeah i mean but you know what i'm just saying the professional pool of the
SPEAKER_01: the elite level arm wrestling is not that big, wasn't that big, it was limited. You understand? So that is why I'm organizing so many super matches. Because I want to give chances to lightweight and this and that, left arm and this, you know. So that I think it needs to be either more often, because or if I do 20 matches, it will be, that is why in January, most likely I will be doing two days event, most likely.
SPEAKER_00: Not 100%, but... Every time you say like, okay, five, seven, maybe maximum 10 fights, but you finish with 15 and more. And right now, probably I can't name all of those fights, if you would ask me, I don't know. But it's... But Yanis, Yanis, think about it. You see this event, it's a good event, right? Absolutely, it's fantastic. But just imagine how many, how many more guys are out. They're not out.
SPEAKER_01: See, Ferit is not here right now. Arif is not here. You don't need to name it. It's impossible, of course. Probably you could name 100 armistice in the world who could be in the event. That's true. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So that is the reason. We need to find a solution and do either a qualification tournament, something we need to do it. Anyways, we can talk about that. And so again, as Josh said,
SPEAKER_01: I mean, this is better than earlier ones. But again, we don't have to, I mean, we must not expect every event to be better, better, better, because there will be a last point. And I don't think there is any other sport event on this earth that in one event, they have all the best. Not in UFC, not in anywhere else. I mean, in one event, you have some. But in East versus West, you can see that
SPEAKER_01: a lot 70 80 percent or best guys or different categories are here so let's start let's start about talking about east versus west yeah so let's start from the the the order of the matches if i am not mistaken about the order of the matches so ryan bowen and zurab taber is there
SPEAKER_01: You know that Ryan was 88.7 kilo on the way in against Ramos. Now he says he is near 105 kilo. Yanis, how do you see? We saw that he also had a good win against Bogdan Stojka.
SPEAKER_01: He beat Khalid, but Khalid had some wars, so I don't know how to judge that match. But Bogdan Stojka, you know that he's a good puller. Yes, yes. How do you see this match right now? You said, okay, 88 or 89 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: we have to remember that also also before that fight he probably was walking around like i don't know 95 or 97 and he was cutting rate for that fight with raymond his natural weight maybe is not 15 kilos more now but of course he's bigger and heavier of course yeah yeah yeah would you agree would you agree if i say that zurab had a match with petrenko with left arm even before i said ryan versus
SPEAKER_01: So Zurab was getting ready for Petrenko. So do you think that the things would be easier for Ryan if Zurab had only a match against Ryan and there was no Petrenko? Maybe his preparation would be, I mean, less than what it is now. You think he would take Ryan easy and then wouldn't prepare at all? Zurab is a serious guy. He's training hard.
SPEAKER_01: no not prepared at all is different but you know uh just taking the preparation so seriously and saying that okay i would beat this guy anyways you know but he was still trained but don't you think that he would be i mean do you think it would be the same exact i i am just saying is i'm unfortunate for uh ryan that you know zurab will be in super super shape there you know
SPEAKER_00: It's a question what mentally push you more to train. Sometimes being afraid that you are favourite and to lose to someone who you think theoretically is not on your level. Maybe it can push you even more than fighting against someone when you are not favourite. And if you watch it from this mental side that probably
SPEAKER_00: the the idea that you can lose is more motivating than the idea that you will win i mean i talked with zurab he didn't sound like he said he's gonna give his wrist he didn't look in his scared at all you know yeah so yeah no but we can also talk about ryan he's he's doing some uh general strength training right now doing a lot of bench presses and and he's claiming that he's getting
SPEAKER_00: 30 or 20 or something percent gains in in in general strength and of course it's good but you you know probably plenty of people who are benching 200 and they are still uh not serious in arm wrestling so it's not it's not uh speaking much about your arm wrestling skills or abilities and will it help him i don't know so how do you see this match i think zurab is clear favorite yeah
SPEAKER_00: and and yeah like what percentage percentage uh of course always always anyone has a chance in a fight sport but uh we saw that uh john was trying to top roll uh zurab and then in this uh posting position uh zurab was uh pressing john's uh john's uh john's top roll
SPEAKER_00: road boss was struggling to top roll when he gets in that position he was not able to win with top roll so uh for joy it was easier to go against arm against arm with with zurabs and go for top roll arm but he went like more like like this lot of rotation too yeah yeah so if if ryan is expecting to top roll zurab
SPEAKER_00: It could be a mistake. We have seen many like also in Evaf and Europe and like Plamen and many others struggling when they get in good position. And it's not easy to finish their ability. It's a fight, but...
SPEAKER_00: i i i think that uh ryan is in big trouble and okay he's heavier he's bigger he's maybe stronger but even if we compare uh his previous uh when he pulled against uh ray and ray is good armistler but we have to understand that ray is maybe maybe in a buff he could be in top six top ten uh somewhere but really not really in a final or podium somewhere
SPEAKER_00: this year 1685 is right arm okay but he's yeah okay ray is good armistice but he's not like uh top three in in in uh in like his weight class but zurab for many years was top three in his weight class okay it was 80 85 but still he was top three so he generally he's i would say higher caliber armistice right now and
SPEAKER_00: And Ryan didn't look too good against Ray. Okay, he won against Bogdan, but still it's, for me, I will be very surprised if Ryan will be successful against Zurab. How do you see, very shortly, if you would answer, how do you see Georgians and Russians not being allowed to compete DWAF, affecting the difficulty level of DWAF?
SPEAKER_00: Of course, in many weight classes, top three could be different in many weight classes. I don't know specifically if we can talk about some arm wrestlers, but you can check any result from previous years and then see how many Georgians, how many Russians were in top three. Usually, all of them.
SPEAKER_01: are in top 10 and most of the times there are because there are two russians and two georgians in each category almost and then usually we see all of them in top 10 and we see one of them from each country in top six somewhere you know so yeah absolutely and uh it's it's it's uh of course that would be different with with russians with georgians uh
SPEAKER_00: But about Georgians, it's a federation question, but with Russians it is how it is. I don't know if politics and sports should go together, but also I don't know how it would be like when it's in one competition, 100 Russians and 100 Ukrainians together right now. I don't know. So it is how it is. And also I think I wouldn't support
SPEAKER_00: Russian teams this year in WAF as well. You mean their participation? Armwrestling is not the only one sport where we see that. In all Olympic sports, I think right now, if we talk about world championships,
SPEAKER_00: no no no one from olympic sports uh no one not the independent decision of each federation but olympic committee says we strongly so exactly you know that there were only athletes from russia in some professional events like uh tennis or or cycling but uh only in some uh like uh commercial tournaments nothing like official world or european championships or
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but I will invite Russians as soon as possible because it is more possible to control. You understand? If you are not like yours, like under Ukraine in that,
SPEAKER_00: there may be some trouble. Just months ago, Vitaly was pulling in Dubai against James. And Skolboj was there. And Skolboj as well, yeah. Skolboj right now, I think he lives in Poland or somewhere else. He's not in Russia anymore. He escaped. And Josh, how do you see Ryan and Zurab? I mean, I agree with Yanis. I think it's probably 90% Zurab. But Ryan is one of those guys...
SPEAKER_04: So your earlier point and getting about how seriously Zahrab would take him. If you remember Michael Bisping in the UFC, he was one of those guys that I feel like a lot of people were more talented than him, but he was continuously underestimated and people didn't take him seriously and ended up winning some matches, I think, because people took him lightly. That match he had with Luke Rockhold comes to mind. And Ryan is like tricky like that. Like you remember a few years back with
SPEAKER_04: Alan Guerra in WAL and Alan really crushed him the first match. And then he started playing around the second match and just holding Ryan in the center. And before he knew it, he had drained himself and he couldn't get the rest of the wins. So if there are plays around, like you were saying, if he gives up his wrist and just sits there, that can be dangerous, you know, because he's not like unlimited endurance machine, you know, Ryan could end up surprising him, but I think if he takes it seriously,
SPEAKER_01: and pretends that he's pulling Oleg, then I think it'll be a very easy day for him. Yanis, this one is specifically for you. Mindaugas Tarasaitis, Justin Bishop. I don't think there is anyone on this earth who would have a better opinion
SPEAKER_01: than yours but it doesn't mean that yours will be perfectly you know fitting because you don't know their current shape you don't know it has been long time but still yours will be probably the best in the world yeah we can we can always uh speculate about results but uh we don't know nothing about uh probably shape right now and especially if we talk about uh just justin as and uh
SPEAKER_00: Last time I saw Justin competing was against StarVJ in WSL, I think. So it's a long time ago and I haven't seen him in some serious, serious competition. So I have no idea about his shape and how good and how prepared he is. He can say that he's in great shape and we have to believe him.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. And we just saw Mindaugas in a Vav. Mindaugas is good as always. Maybe was not so lucky in a Vav. Had some tough fights, tough draw. With Daniel? With Daniel and also with Armenian. The match that caused maybe Armenian match like that, everything started with the Daniel match.
SPEAKER_00: He took it and then he was just like this, this, this. He already got exhausted there. When you have a 30, 40 seconds long match with Daniel, it takes a lot from you, yeah. When I was stepping up to table in second round, probably first, when I saw that I have to pull Daniel, first thing in my mind was not to spend too much energy. But it was not my problem. And I lost quickly, so...
SPEAKER_01: and yeah but uh if seriously about the fight is there some weight limit i i don't know 82 kilo we changed the weight categories like in the past we were making some deal with the athletes for the category and but now we like it was 80 90 it was going like this but after this match
SPEAKER_01: We changed the category so we couldn't play with the weight that was agreed already. But now it is 75, 85, 95. But when I set the match, there was no official weight classes this way. So they agreed at 82 at that time. But it will be considered as 85 kilo category. Yeah, probably Justin will be around 82 as well. And Minder will be some 76 or something, 77. I haven't seen him being much bigger yet.
SPEAKER_00: That's how it is. Stylistically, if we think about the fight, it's very, very hard to hook Mindaugas and there are not so many arm wrestlers who can get inside with Mindaugas, but I don't think that
SPEAKER_00: Justin will try to hook Mindaugas. He will go with his posting top role. And also, also right now, just a few weeks ago in a WAF, we saw that Minda lost his wrist against Armenian. We have seen this in an arm wars.
SPEAKER_00: in few fights that he's struggling more often when someone is trying to top rolls and hook. Nannestad, also I think Filip from Slovakia top rolled Minde in Lithuanian Championship last two years.
SPEAKER_00: sharuna's monarch has won against minde who is good top roller who took four plays this year 80 kilo class always posting always good yeah same as yeah it's showing that it's possible to top roll minde and uh justin has all that all that all that strength all that understanding about about that style and he could he could do but how strong he will show up i don't know
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. If he is in his best shape or somewhere close, he definitely has a chance. Okay. Stylistically, and from what you remember, remember Justin is not 75 as WAL, but 82. Probably he will be 85 kilos on the competition day. And you'll still be 76 kilos. And then whenever you judge this way,
SPEAKER_00: Who do you give the edge? Like I said, I have no idea how strong is Bishop. We can talk about weight, but not always it's saying all about your shape and about your performance. He has not been very active lately, and I don't have any data to compare with. You talk about Nannestad, but Mindago said that Mindago's pull, another super match,
SPEAKER_01: only 20 minutes before Nannestad, and Nannestad didn't have a super match before that. But Nannestad was fresh? Was fresh, yes. Yeah, and also the rounds that Minda was at the buckle, Nannestad was able to pin him, and then rounds that
SPEAKER_01: I was surprised that the buckle was so, I would say, important for both of them that they couldn't do anything without. I was surprised. Round six, Mindaugas had everything. And he was very smart. He just waited, waited, waited, waited, waited, like he cannot pin him or something.
SPEAKER_00: He made Nannistar tired in the round seven. When Nannistar had the buckle advantage, he still couldn't finish him. And then Milagos was able to... What I see with this fight is that if this fight will stop somewhere in a more or less decent position for both of them,
SPEAKER_00: and it will start some technical things and longer fights it's definitely advantage for Mindaugas. He's one of armwrestlers I would say like it's you can always say it's like he's a good armwrestler he's technical armwrestler and he's like master then I say Mindaugas is in this highest class he's like I like to say virtuoso he's like an artist of armwrestling and
SPEAKER_00: his arm is one of arm wrestlers i like to watch how he pulls and in a longer fight where it's both athletes are even physically more or less even
SPEAKER_01: he definitely have advantage over Justin in a longer fight. But Justin has his first move, start, hit. That's his advantage, explosiveness. He can be very good from start. And he can take it with posting, with even a little bit lost wrist. If Justin, with the start, would take Mindaugas' wrist, he would win. But if he just goes, and if the match stop in an equal position, Mindaugas will find a way to win the match. Yes. Same. Agree. Agree.
SPEAKER_04: And Josh? Justin, when he's heavy, it can be very dangerous. Again, going back to WAL, he took that first match off of RBJ. A lot of it was speed and position, but still, it was impressive to me. As a heavier person, I think it does make a difference, but I know he had some injuries, and I haven't seen any videos of him pulling lately.
SPEAKER_01: I feel like that's a major detriment for him. I mean, he said he healed up. He said he told me that that that is a good thing about the like a cooking for some time. He said he started training even before I offer him the match. He said he did a training. He said that his elbow was good. No pain at all. You know? Yeah, I mean, I think that's great, but I still feel like you know the experience in competition. You gotta give that to Mindy.
SPEAKER_04: He's pulling under the strict rules for the last few years, every couple of months. So he's very comfortable on it. That's not a, uh, style of rules that Justin has pulled really in a while. I mean, the rules here in the United States tend to be looser, even when people are doing WAF style rules. So that's always a factor for me. And I, and I think top rule to top rule, I think it's going to be tough for Justin. I would say his best chances in the first match. Um, but.
SPEAKER_04: All of your points make sense to me. Mindy definitely has lost a lot more in the last two years than he had been the previous three or four. So I think it's a very interesting match and I wouldn't, I wouldn't want to predict it. Um, but I do think, uh, I would give the edge to Mindy still. Yeah. I mean, that was his losses usually against the people who are heavier than him. Usually, you know,
SPEAKER_01: one is 80 kilo guy, other one is 85 kilo guy usually. And the Armenian he lost, it was right after he had a long match with Daniel Prokopchuk. But he still managed to beat him with a dead wrist. Anyways, so yeah. And did you guys know that they, in my program here, they made a deal that if Mindaugas loses, he will shave his head
SPEAKER_04: And if Justin loses, he's going to shave his beard. Okay. That's a good one. I like that. Yeah. Draw a possibility, some draw or something or health. Yeah, then you have exactly. That would be great. Best of five. I don't know how we can draw, but let's see. I think that should happen right after the match. You should have a barber ready to just come over and that would be fun.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm going to bring one to the stage right away. Yeah. So this one, let's start with you, Josh. Adam Wojcicki and Bozidar. 92 kilo weight limit and Bozidar is 85 kilo. Adam is about 95. He will make 92 in the competition day. He will be 95. How do you see that one? Bozidar.
SPEAKER_04: I will literally be shocked if Adam beats him. And I mean, I know Adam a little bit, just obviously he's United States polar super strong. Um, but I just have so much confidence and, uh, especially his right arm Bozy. So it just, uh, I just don't see it going any other way. I think it's really awesome that Adam's coming over. Cause he's, he's one of those guys around here that not even everyone in the United States knows, but he's very skilled. He's got wins against big people. I think it's going to be fun for him.
SPEAKER_04: But I'll definitely go on Bozidar on that one. And you, Yanis?
SPEAKER_00: You showed him, right? When you went to pulling Corey Miller, he was there as well. Yeah, we were in the same competition. And of course, he's a strong, good armwrestler, good inside game. But Bozidar can pull much, much and can do much more than just a good inside game. And if Bozidar will feel that it's not working and you can go through this hook, he can find another way.
SPEAKER_00: We all are human and we saw just Bozidar, okay, it's much totally opposite style, but how he lost against Cvetan Gashevsky. And also we know that Bozidar time to time have some bad days and then he's not always winning. And he has lost before, for example, to Vladislav in Europeans in a hook.
SPEAKER_01: and then some others so also in his previous super match against uh samushia so it's possible but if if we ask who's favorite of course bojder's favorite yeah the one one one small note before he lost to vladislavs he had a war with the moldovian what was his name the guy oleg tudorian yeah oleg and him just literally killed like one minute match you know just like bojderian
SPEAKER_01: and then right after the people uh not to take anything away but that wasn't like a super fresh refresh yeah but not not like super much not like super much yeah oleg used to uh live in boston he trained with us on our team for about a year it was really fun having him over here super powerful good kid oleg oleg from moldova yeah oh yeah i know that he is in the united states but i didn't know that he is he lived in america as well
SPEAKER_01: I didn't know that. Yeah. And you are saying that Yanis shortly Minda Bojidar is going to win?
SPEAKER_00: We will see who will win, but Borzder is favorite and even with all the great difference and usually Borzder is great in a super match format and he can pull for long and he loves those deep inside game and then he can also do some different things on table as well. Have you heard of Chad Silvers?
SPEAKER_01: Sorry? Chad Silvers. Have you heard of him? Yeah, yeah. I love Chad Silvers. I even have pulled him, Chad Silvers, in 2004, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, oh, Zlotyser. Yes. Oh, you guys met each other there? Yes, yes, yes. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that event was first Rustam, second Gachevski, as far as I remember. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. Anyways, this is his training. And I lost to Chad Silvers and Gashevsky, yeah. And Chad Silvers lost to Gashevsky and Rustam Baber. Yes. And Chad Silvers is the trainer of Coach Adam. And he's coming to Istanbul to be on the stage just to coach him. Yeah. I've also lost to Chad Silvers. Yeah. Chad Silvers, especially very strong hand fingers, very strong grip, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so let's move. Sergei Kalinichenko versus Georgy Dzeranov. I don't know as much about these two guys. I mean, I know Dzeranov more, and he's super impressive to me, but I really am not familiar with Sergei. Sergei didn't pull a lot. He pulls a lot, too.
SPEAKER_00: about it will be right right or left right arm because he broke his left arm i just yeah i wanted to ask which which which arm he broke in it was lottie 2018 17 when it was 2018 i think yeah in a in a final with uh alan mckeo he broke his arm yes i think so um cobra what do you say will england after pull devon or too big
SPEAKER_04: What do you mean? Can you clarify what you're saying? He's giving you a hard time. He's basically saying you guys aren't going to pull because he doesn't know you. That's just another person who's got an opinion, you know. I think it'd be fun if you guys after pulled. I think Devin's not going to do a lot of after pulling though. Yeah. Anyway, so and your opinion, Yanis?
SPEAKER_00: Gerrano is very good. His shape time to time could be different, but we have seen some incredible armwrestling from Gerrano when he's just playing with everyone in Russia in Motoshino tournament, when he was winning against Hajimura Zuruya so easily, when he was winning against
SPEAKER_00: matushenko in in in a waffle so gerardo could be could be could be great when he's in good shape not always but uh he's very good uh sergey sergey uh last time we saw him pulling was probably as well not so not so not so i don't know lately it was lotto tour after that some uh
SPEAKER_00: some some some maybe top eight fights or was was he in some uh tournaments in nepal i don't know right right now he lives i think in uh france oh uh france yes i think france or belgium somewhere there you know yeah and he looks much bigger than before and then definitely has gained some weight
SPEAKER_00: but it's just the only thing we can see is his Instagram or Facebook some videos from training and some practice with Devon or practice with
SPEAKER_00: with uh vz or some other arm wrestlers but that's it i don't know i don't know i don't i don't have any information how how good or how strong probably they both will be very prepared but that's it i i don't have any other information but they say potentially potentially they both are very strong arm wrestlers and uh has proved that before one has won uh
SPEAKER_01: world championship other has won lotto tour they are super high class arm wrestlers that's what they can say yeah anderson yeah anyway so and then we go another one and cobra and hyder both of them are untrained some people says no cobra is not untrained i saw him in the event is in a state event
SPEAKER_01: I think it's the same about Haider. I saw him in Antalya just a few weeks ago. I saw him pulling and he did good. I mean, he had a tough match with a guy from Norway. But usually the prime Haider that we know that has wins against like Rick Pia and some other guys, you know, and Bondo Hupalo and
SPEAKER_01: and other guys and he even has a win against shamil karajayev you know so normally uh he wouldn't perform like that i offered them match at same time both were like years of no training and then they they start training of course by the time of the competition they both will be training for three months after many years of absence yeah i mean i would love to see cobra win it
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I'm obviously a big fan of his. He started off in the Massachusetts area where I live, and his top role is still legendary. I mean, I don't know what kind of shape he's in. I know he's been up and down the last few years, but I would love to see him win. I have a little bit of optimism that he is going to win, but it's kind of hard to, I mean, again, like you said, they've both been training for three months, and I obviously saw him in Antalya, too. He looked good. He traded shirts with one of the
SPEAKER_04: guys from Team USA, super nice person. So I'm excited that you have the match. And again, because I think it's really cool to expose like modern arm wrestlers to some of these great names from not too long ago, but certainly in the past that are, you know, my age and older. So I think it's great that you're doing it. I hope you keep doing it. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. And, you know, right, Yanis, in January, Zaur and Sharon will go.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes, yes. You said before we were talking in porn and you said that, yeah. It's great and it's...
SPEAKER_00: For me as an armwrestler who was pulling also 20 years ago and then I was watching to Haider and I was watching to Cobra and actually I pulled them both as well and for me it's great to see them back on the table and I will absolutely enjoy that fight. It will be a clash of styles. I think there will be no big surprise that Haider will try to go inside and Cobra will go for top roll.
SPEAKER_01: I think both will go outside. Yeah, Haider is not inside. I saw Haider in Antalya. He was pulling everyone. And I was like, what's happening? Why don't you sprint? He said, my arm doesn't want to go there. He didn't do any table time at all during the preparation. He just lives. He was saving his inside game for Cobra. I don't think so. I don't think so either. We'll see.
SPEAKER_01: anyways um um so what is the next one we have many many many many but uh let's go okay yeah it's this one david samusha versus daniel prokopchik oh man that's gonna be great daniel said he will be around 82 kilo
SPEAKER_01: by the time of the competition. And interestingly, like long time during these interviews, people said, oh, Samusha, Samusha, Samusha. Last a few days, I started to have opinions from Matushenko, Krasimir, and Bojidar. And then these people are saying, Daniel is going to win or 50-50, they are saying. And how do you guys see it? Well, Daniel is so impressive.
SPEAKER_04: At WAF, I mean, I can understand why, like, it's going towards him a little bit. I agree. I think it's really, really close, but I feel I would vote for Daniel right now. I think Daniel's form right now is excellent. So you think Daniel is going to beat Samusha? I do. I think it's going to be close. I think it'll be, you know, three to two, but I think he's going to win. And Giannis?
SPEAKER_00: In a slow game, in a slow hook, it seems like our own same weight class. It's just very few who can fight even with Daniel. But also we saw that in a slow fight, in a long fight, Samusha was able to win against Bojidar inside. So also like opponent is doing, can do the same, but and then,
SPEAKER_00: like shape like shape and and as a strength levels probably it's it's it's very very even fight it's very even fighter i think uh samushia will get in a better position with his wrist with his hand he can really have this deep turnaround position and maybe he can get in a better position with daniel and i see that daniel probably will be in this defensive uh calling position but uh
SPEAKER_00: who will i i don't think it will be fast i don't think it will be fast and some flash pins it's definitely will be will be some uh technical tactical game who will win from that it's it's very hard to predict it's very hard to predict i think it's even five that's that's that's i don't know great it's gonna be an amazing match i agree that'll be slow i think um
SPEAKER_00: position and be in the middle and they're going to say samushia style is a is a in in inside he could he could take uh daniel's rotator pronator like uh like uh like he was doing with uh
SPEAKER_00: and in in uh but for daniel sometimes it's not a problem but still he in inside he loves to keep active his rotator his pronator but uh daniel with a very strong hand and wrist which is it which is stronger than uh daniel's he could take that rotator and then it could it could be that uh daniel have to hold in not so good position that he could be in a bad position but he can still maybe find a way out of that
SPEAKER_00: With left arm, I think Daniel could win or would win that fight. With right arm? What do you think, Engin? Or you are not saying? I'm an organizer. You are not a referee. You are not a referee. You will not stand. A lot of people are waiting. Oh, Engin is biased. He said this.
SPEAKER_01: wants this guy to win you know a lot of paranoid people like two percent two percent in the community but still you know enough to give headache you know so i better keep uh keep it to myself and but i am i can say that you said about bojidar bojidar's hook is like fully supinated and given his own pronator while uh
SPEAKER_01: uh daniel also has a good top role and he's protecting too yeah he's perfect the samusha can also protect it depends you know yeah yeah especially daniel uh samusha whenever he hooks a hook puller usually he doesn't try to catch but he goes to his own angle like he even drives his elbow back and rolls so
SPEAKER_00: let's see let's see i mean yeah that's that's why i think he could get in a better position that he could he could uh a little bit over like rotate uh daniel but uh about that arm strength that arm strength daniel's arm strength is incredible so we will see but you said you said about this uh those opinions and the fans are saying
SPEAKER_00: We all are. Same me, same you. We are trying to be fair and trying to save my opinions. And I'm not saying like that I would like to see or that I know. But whenever, whenever you're on the phone with Daniel or I'm not one of you, I don't want to be fair. I try to say what I'm thinking about the fight, not like supporting one another. That is different thing that when an organizer is saying, I think this this guy is going to win. It kind of little bit sounds different. You understand?
SPEAKER_01: And if I say, I think this guy is going to win, then that little bit, like I gave my prediction, whenever someone else is organizing, you know, no problem. Whenever I'm organizing, then it is a little bit different, you know. Anyway, so other than this, so Bortolato versus Zerano. Yanis, let's start with you.
SPEAKER_01: Have they pulled before? I think Gerrano was not active yet when Bartolotto was winning his titles. Early 2010s, you know, Bartolotto, and then he went to more professional. And then, I don't know, even like four years ago or something, he was still around like sometimes 100 kilos. It was 2018, I remember, I think he was 100 kilos. I think, if I'm not mistaken. But 2019, he won...
SPEAKER_00: 110 kilo yeah so they both have been world champions in uh one one ten kilo plus and uh but it's like different generation and uh bartolotto was winning in uh 2000 2006 2012 2000 yeah yeah yeah yeah and and i saw the because we asked them we make the graphics for their weight height and everything portolato
SPEAKER_01: He's not fat at all, and he's 151 kilos. 151? Zerano is 123 kilos. Zerano trains all the time. He's absolutely a maniac in the gym, so that doesn't surprise me. I think he's underdog, personally. Wagner? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I think maybe in the United States, he's not as well known, but he's, um, I remember when you were thinking about putting him up against, uh, uh, Jerry a while back and Jerry had never heard of him. So I sent them some videos and he was like, Whoa, cause he's very impressive. And so it's just one of those guys that maybe is not as well known in the United States, um, North America, but he's so strong and so technical and Wagner is, um,
SPEAKER_04: think he's in great shape but i'm not sure if arm wrestling is still his number one focus maybe it is but i i feel like uh he's the underdog yeah do you guys suggest me to put extra balls on the table for for referees called each leg and like he's gonna shake it yeah
SPEAKER_00: No, Wagner is good and I know him for many years and it's always fun to sit at the table. He has never been the most, I would say, technical and when you see him in the gym, it's not looking that he's training for arm wrestling, he's just trying to break something or the biggest possible plate in the gym. But he's strong, he's strong and he could prove this as well.
SPEAKER_00: You talk about who has more chance, probably Gerrano. Because lately, lately, lately, I haven't seen much from him as well. But at least what I saw from Gerrano three years ago, three, two, four years ago, it was very impressive. And I think even 2019 shape of Gerrano,
SPEAKER_01: I think could win against Bortolotto. But if he's even bigger right now, but we'll see. It's just predictions. Yeah, yeah. And I think both of these guys would easily beat Cody Merritt. Cody, you are in the chat. Sorry, Cody. He just said he wins. See, Cody Merritt says,
SPEAKER_01: i am way more than 150 kilo and almost zero fat he says i can confirm that yeah we we love you cody we love you absolutely yeah anyways so let's let's move pauline and gamtanaza i'm looking forward to that predicting that i'm i'm a huge fan of paul and i think i said it before in the show and his work ethic
SPEAKER_04: And I think everybody knows he's better. I mean, he's a guy, he hasn't been around as long as a lot of other people on this card, but his, uh, so he's still, but I think works in his favor because his trajectory in terms of technique is, uh, it's better than a lot of other people because he's still learning. And, um, his power level is so high that every time he has a match on, you know, an international scene, I feel more optimistic about the next match that he has.
SPEAKER_04: think he's still an underdog here but i i i would not be surprised if paul if paul wins and i hope he wins because i'm a fan of his and i'm a friend of his but um i just think he's getting a lot better and i'm glad that you keep inviting him here because it's motivating him to train even harder yeah any honest yeah every every time i see paul in pools uh
SPEAKER_00: He seems like sometimes when he's in his positions like a newbie or beginner, he's not technically like, he's not looks so effective, but it is effective. It is effective and it's working and he's winning. And I was very surprised about his win against Samushia and also how he pulled against Ron Boss, Gentanadze. When was last time we saw Gentanadze on table? I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I don't remember even when I saw Gentanadze pulling, but Gentanadze has been a European World Champion. He has won over many best or greatest armwrestlers that time around his weight class. He has a very strange style inside. He has this open hook game and not everyone is able to get out of that position.
SPEAKER_01: It will be interesting. Yeah. But I don't know when Gentanadze was active last time. I don't know. He said that he's in his best ever shape of his life. What else he can say? What else? No, I mean, he doesn't have to say this, but he really, he said that even if Paul was 110 kilos and he is 95 only, he would still beat him. This is what he's saying here, yeah. Because best from Gentanadze, I think what we saw was like around 10 years ago or...
SPEAKER_00: or something like that, like the beginning of 2010 or 2000 or maybe 2012. Yeah, no, no, no. Meet 2010. I think he won the World's 2015 or something. He won 16. Not in Malaysia. No, before before 1617. Maybe I don't know. I know that he won the World's. I think before and he has four years disqualification as well. So it was all before that.
SPEAKER_00: time is running. I think it was some 2000, maybe, maybe 13, maybe, maybe 2014 when, when, when we saw really good Genta Nadze, but okay. Yeah. It's definitely, he have all potential to be strong because we have seen him doing great things on table. That's for sure. Yeah. Anyway. So, Pauline, you know, I was just, I mean, the guy just surprises me, you know, when I was,
SPEAKER_01: He won one round against Samusha, and then Samusha won the next two rounds. And I was like, okay, I think he's over. And then he just went back and he just won the next two rounds. And I was like, wow. You know, it was just very surprising. And him hooking and beating Rambeth and him giving a hard time to John, even injuring John's pronator. And I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I don't know. I think there will be an incredible match. If one of them dominates the other one, I will be very surprised. I will be very surprised, yeah. Anyway, so let's move. Let's move. I don't know if I'm missing anything. Petrenko versus Zurab, left arm. Yanis, you start.
SPEAKER_00: Most likely Petrenko will take Zurov's hand. That's kind of what I expect. Can he finish from that? Usually I would say yes. Petrenko is strong enough with his arm strength and I think he could. But I think Petrenko, nice poster. It's not paper, it's just very high quality.
SPEAKER_00: like yeah and uh why we are not seeing you in the middle of it some uh yeah i i am not at the middle but i am behind all of this okay yeah yeah okay it's it's uh maybe i don't see you i don't see you anyway i don't know when i say i'm behind like i'm the one you know behind all of this yeah guys if you want one of these with sign you know
SPEAKER_01: Denis Tsiplenko will sign and Levon Saginashvili and all the other athletes who are competing, I will sign too. And so just before, because last time we did the... Okay, he says the GP says that 2016 Europeans, Kamtenadze won gold with both arms. 16. Europeans, yeah. 16, he says, yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: and i think that was a competition when he get disqualified after that i don't know i have no idea and i am not sure because in 2019 or 18 or something we again i saw him at the europeans or something anyway so whatever and
SPEAKER_00: So you are saying that Petrenko will take Zurab's wrist with left hand? Yes, I think Petrenko will take Zurab's wrist and also I think that Petrenko is favorite in this fight. But what is Zurab's advantage is he is great in longer fights. And we saw that also Petrenko, when he was pulling Raimonds Antonovic, he was gassing out at later rounds.
SPEAKER_00: his endurance at least in that fight was not so great so only advantage where i see for zurev is if he's able to stop petrenko and maybe maybe have some longer fight and then petrenko could get tired but uh fresh for fresh i can just see that uh
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he will. But that's my prediction. And it could be absolutely different than maybe Zurab can do some super strong fast press. I don't know. But I think that Petrenko is his favorite in this one. Petrenko said that here, he said he is now 30% stronger in the gym.
SPEAKER_01: compared to the times that he won Zloty 2019 and Rimon match. And he's about 10 kilo heavier. Because those were in 95, now he's 105 kilo.
SPEAKER_00: He doesn't say about the table, but the ways that he is lifting. People want to say those numbers and percents. Okay, I saw him doing some that he was doing sitting biceps with 100 kilo curl. So it's like if we are taking mathematics, it's 70 kilo he was doing in
SPEAKER_01: one rep max in Zloty 2018? Mathematically it doesn't work that way because 30% of the 70 kilo is 21 kilo. So it is when you think about the whole 100 then 30% but if he was doing 70 kilo and if it is 30 kilo more sorry 30% more it is the
SPEAKER_00: 10 times 3 21 he would be 91. so his his weight was lifting he was about 78 kilos okay okay 75 30 percent of uh 30 percent of 75 is 25 okay 75. he was doing 75 kilo biceps curl we can do 75 kilo biceps curl in sitting position we can do it
SPEAKER_00: I don't think it's true. I don't think he would lie to us. People want to say some numbers and maybe it's true that in some exercise he's lifting 30 or maybe even 40% more. It could be true. It could be true, but the table will show most likely. When somebody says that I am 30% stronger, like arm wrestler, I am like,
SPEAKER_01: But about the weightlifting, the numbers, I don't know. But translation to table is never the same, you know. Absolutely. Super chat. You got there, Engin? Yeah, Alex. Thank you, my friend, for your super chat. Hello to you, my friends, Engin, Yanis, and Josh. A plus card. Thank you, my friend. Can't wait for Devon to get the stuff.
SPEAKER_01: And by the way, let's get Yanis and portray some matches. Hopefully January, if Yanis wants, hopefully January. Hope you are getting better, Engin. Would love you in a match. Thank you, Dr. Alex. I don't know. I just had stem cell, Yanis. I did do this middle knuckles, wrist, and the elbow capsule here.
SPEAKER_01: he the guy said that it will take four months for the full effect can i can i say like it i feel better maybe yes but he also did to my this lateral uh yeah like lateral epicondyle or yeah yeah that one where i also had the surgery that one like
SPEAKER_01: Even if I do three kilo hammer curl with dumbbell, that still hurting in a point whenever it's passing here. Something is wrong there. I don't know what it is, but I don't think it has anything to do. The moment that hurts me, Yanis, is like this hurts. You see? This one hurts. This one hurts. And this hurts. This area.
SPEAKER_00: is killing me you know but you have to understand that not always uh problem is where the pain is it could be could be much different region and very very often we'll feel some pain but problem is somewhere else so uh yeah maybe you're right uh class will come to this event east versus west class will be yes in istanbul yeah oh that's great that's great you can do some uh traction
SPEAKER_00: my yeah yeah neck traction yeah yeah neck traction ask him he have some good neck traction device at home do you think it helps it works you think good
SPEAKER_00: uh if if next traction is helping you then why not why not because if if it helps with you when someone is doing it manually with hands it will help as well if you will do it with distraction system yeah if it's helping for you at all they put their fingers and something they just move you know this is just like a different work you know manual work is different than you put in something and then pumping in a yeah
SPEAKER_01: know just pressing believing in treatment is making big wonders so uh yeah i mean i i believe that i when i tried but i'm sure it's helping i'm sure 100 is helping but i i just don't think it is as effective as the other one
SPEAKER_00: But you know better, for sure. Of course, of course. Sometimes with hands, good specialists have this, like he feels a difference. And sometimes with just touching, he can feel where at some points, of course, of course. One time somebody did, Yanis, you will not believe. Normally when I arm wrestle, my arms, because of the pain, to recover, it takes like
SPEAKER_01: one week, you understand to have like, finally, I mean, I can still train, but to have like, totally, I feel fine. You know, I had table training. And one guy did that to me. Next day, I train again. And another thing you will not believe my arm size get bigger. Maybe one something maybe maybe some kind of signal wasn't coming. You understand?
SPEAKER_01: whenever he upstairs or maybe the thing is muscles muscles are not growing in a day or even a week so far so the difference is probably with some uh blood flow what what you expected it was uh some difference in blood flow don't you think that when the signal doesn't go like when when i had the 2012 you remember right the left side was totally yes yeah and the signal didn't go there in in one week my arm like was 30 something just born you know
SPEAKER_01: and the chest was only ribs and the leg was gone shoulder was gone no signal and suddenly it became you remember that picture right yeah but yes probably probably that the problem with signal was even before that for a longer time that that one week was very like acute period but probably problem was much uh for a longer time but yeah i don't know you were you were talking about it went down in a week yeah it was probably but this one after he did sometime later i saw
SPEAKER_01: but there was like probably more signal to my arm. But you say like one day later. No, no, no, no. One day later, I could train again. No pain, I could train. But my arm slowly get bigger. I think there was more signal. And whenever I feel my hand like this, now I don't feel that the ear, the signal is going so quick. But at that time, I was like my young years. You understand? The hand was so good, you understand? I could feel everything in my hand.
SPEAKER_01: So I think that the signal, which is coming from brain,
SPEAKER_00: helps a lot. But you can do some diagnostics, you can do a narrow miograph, you can do and check how much signal is going to your fingers and where it's lost, where it's in elbow or it's in shoulder. You can do it, diagnostics, make narrow miograph and they will say, okay, there is a compression and then maybe like 50 or 60% of signal is just going through, which are coming from your brain or spinal cord.
SPEAKER_01: guy who did the stem cell to me gave me a some type of mixed uh b12 and i think maybe even vitamin c something injection yeah i did that like six days in a row you know that that thing it's usually a big vitamin b complex length like narrow ruby or something like that b complex which are helping with uh but i can tell you something my brain also was trust me sharper
SPEAKER_01: but but you know what it's helping only if you have uh this deficit if your vitamin b level is already good you will not feel any difference so it shows that there was some deficit but whenever i had it i felt it i kind of i don't i didn't i don't know how much i felt because i wasn't training but about my brain and then thinking thinking you know i said i felt it i don't know yeah anyway so
SPEAKER_01: Yusuf Danisman- Caroline Thank you, my friend, for the chat blood flow police system back work and arms. Yusuf Danisman- Thank you, thank you for your support Alex this I love how I started this conversation the other day, I want him he'll up he'll for a mess yeah yeah yeah, but we need to pull. Alex Sarkissian, You want to start a long conversation with armors as I have to do is bring up injuries and then we have a lot to say.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, if we wanted, we could talk three hours about all the injuries, you know. Jan Janis could preach us. He's the one that I can talk only because I have so much experience. He is the doctor. I'm the one who fell down from the roof. What do you think about stem cells? What's your opinion on them? Stem cells?
SPEAKER_00: I don't have any personal experience, it's just what I have heard, what I have read about, and I was surprised actually that in Europe it's possible to do that, but I think in the European Union it's not allowed yet, but as we say in Turkey, you can do it. In the USA,
SPEAKER_00: I think you have more experience than we have. You have more examples, and many armistice have tried. That's the opinion what we want to hear, and also from Engin's experience, we can learn. There's a lot of people, you can go to, I mean, it's expensive in the United States. It's a different type, right? You know, Josh, it's a different type. It's a different type. In Mexico, they do with, I forgot, what's that thing that,
SPEAKER_01: when the baby is feeding himself. Yeah, problems. They say embryo, placenta or placenta? Embryo, but the other thing, placenta. Placenta, yeah. Yeah, yeah. They do from that one. Mine is they took my fat from belly and then they took the cells and injected my own cells to me, not from another. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Everybody that I talked to has had it. Basically, it comes down to
SPEAKER_04: There's not enough information to have a definitive answer, but it seems like some people say it was a miracle, and some people say it did nothing. So I don't know. Every time I look it up, it's kind of the same thing. We're not sure what it does. We're not sure if it works. We're not sure if it doesn't work. The people that it works for obviously think it was a miracle. But I mean, honestly, Yannis, it reminds me a lot of what you mentioned earlier, which is the belief in healing, placebo effect kind of thing. I wonder.
SPEAKER_04: how much of it is a real thing and what Engen mentioned, I mean, the different types that you can use, how much of a difference that would make. I guess I don't feel like we have enough evidence yet, but I think about it, you know, with my right arm, which has been bothering me almost a year now, like sometimes I feel like it's worth a try to go down there and see what happens, but there's just not enough evidence for me to be sure about it.
SPEAKER_00: It's with any injury and with any treatment. It's not like my neighbor or my friends did that to his shoulder and it helped. It will help for me. So it's same with stem cells. If it's some inflammation, if it's some tendinitis, if it's some degeneration, it could help locally. But if your problem in elbow is because you have some narrow compression in neck or something else,
SPEAKER_00: You can put as many same cells you want in your elbow, your problem is somewhere else. That's why also we get not always the same results. To have this understanding, you need very good control group which are doing those treatments and they should have similar problem and also similar pathology and then we can maybe understand what's happening.
SPEAKER_01: these guys to like waf one year and just have everybody line up and get it and have a control group yeah that'll give us a lot of evidence for our sport at the very least i mean uh the the problem with me is that i have many problems janice this may fix one of my problems which is those the cartilage you know the doctor hold my fingers here he said that like they are garbage he said they are like
SPEAKER_01: gone you know he said that this this knuckles here gone he hold here and he catch some like nerve damage here and then he hold here he i don't know i didn't tell him anything he just holds and finds it but the ones that he did into the uh the joint capsule and the wrist joint and this they may help but that's not the only problem as you said there is some nerve problems and other things
SPEAKER_01: I need to fix all of them so that I can come back. Fixing one of the problems will not be... Yeah. Anyway, so let's go. Let's go. Pauline versus Sandis. Pauline? I talked with Krasimir. Krasimir said that Krasimir Kostadinov. I talked to him. Yes. I said, right? Mathematics guy said, right?
SPEAKER_01: And Krasimir said that the mat that he felt, he said, it was incredible. He said even he made it strapped so tight, still he took his wrists so badly. And he says that recently he saw those forearm, you know, video, and he said that he's even bigger than last time he saw him. And he said that he is right now in very dangerous form. This is what Krasimir said. But from other side, we also see Sanderis, Sanderis,
SPEAKER_01: The horsepower, I mean, beating Alexander Getalo in hook, wow, you know, not many people can do that on this earth. And we see that he can top rope, he can side press, he can go hook, he can even do this. So I'm not expecting an easy match. How do you see that, Marcianis? I know you cannot be objective about this match.
SPEAKER_00: I have probably much more information about Sandriss and his current shape and his current problems. I don't know if I have to talk about that but also in my gym we were talking about that fight much and I say that Matt Mask is favorite for this fight.
SPEAKER_00: It's just four weeks. It will be just four weeks after WAF and it's a short time. And Sandris is trying to recover from WAF, but it's not easy. And he's struggling a little bit with some illness. So it will be very tough for him to show his best shape. That's what I'm thinking. Sandris is always optimistic and he's as a younger and
SPEAKER_00: I don't know how to say, athlete who always will fight to end. He believes that he has a great chance, but I think Sandris is underdog in this fight. He was struggling with Ukrainian, he was struggling with
SPEAKER_00: both arms, also his right arm when Ukrainian was going for top roll. Samir was struggling to go top roll against him and his wrist was losing. So he was like kind of pushed to go inside with him. And to have a very good hand is a main thing you need when you fight against when you fight against Matt Musk. But does he think that he is like optimistic and
SPEAKER_00: is gonna win yeah yeah that's that's what he's believing and uh you you can't go to any fight if you don't have believe in yourself he should have but uh what what i'm saying is that uh
SPEAKER_00: definitely do sundries have chance yes he he does but uh i think matt is a favorite and uh i think in in this situation in this situation it will be very hard for uh for sundries to win that's what i'm thinking yeah you are saying also also stylistically also stylistically matt is matt is pulling in in a style which uh which could be could be could be tough for sundries to to face
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but again, you know, even at VARF, you said that he was struggling against the top rowers. Yeah, so probably Matt's top row will for sure not be any less than Sandry's. Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's a short time, and we came back after VARF, and Sandry tested positive with COVID, and he's still struggling.
SPEAKER_00: but he said that he didn't feel like so terrible he said he's at home but was he really he told me like two days ago it's still temperature for him it's still uh so very and it's already like a temperature for for 10 days so it's a
SPEAKER_00: He was better. He was in a gym. He was training again. But right now, again, it's OK. It's just like there are no complaints. He will do his best and then he will try to fight. But just what I think is in this situation,
SPEAKER_00: it's very tough for sandris to to to to show like his uh best performance and then to do good against matt and uh what i think that mark after his previous defeat is is a is very well motivated and uh he he i think stylistically also he's uh have very good chance against sundries and uh
SPEAKER_01: yeah that's what i'm thinking that uh he's his favorite in this fight jamie says thank you for your support engine i hope you have a spare table in the back which matt and wagner wagner arounds yeah we will make strong screws you know matt is not dangerous matt only this the problem is wagner you know and what is more talking than doing yeah you want you mean
SPEAKER_04: I think, you know, Matt said it himself that he was not going to lose again. And I think he's been training out of his mind since that last match. And he's been very impressive in the videos and he kind of had like after a WL, he had like a little streak of not great performances. And I think, um, he's when he's really motivated, he's super dangerous stuff. He said about Sandra's.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, obviously I thought he was really impressive at WAF, watching him, his matches were amazing, but they were also brutal, a lot of matches. And just to go what you were saying earlier and getting about how long it takes you to recover from that. I know it takes me more than like a month to be honest with you. And I'm older, I'm 51, but I think it does take a lot out of you. And just hearing what you're saying about his struggle with COVID, I have to agree that Matt is definitely the favorite. I understand.
SPEAKER_04: So let's move on and talk about Hermes Gasparini and Artyom Morozov with left arm. Artyom Morozov for me. I think Morozov wins. I mean, uh, I know Armi's left is really good and probably underappreciated, but, uh, Morozov is such an impressive person for me. And you mentioned this, I think in the last show we talked, uh, Engen is that Morozov's
SPEAKER_04: trajectory is is better than most of the other pullers on this card because he is still young and still learning and still getting stronger um like almost on a weekly basis and I think uh it's a very tough match for Hermes um even stylistically Morozov is just he's really clever you know I mean he's watching him pull in the last few matches he's impressive to me and I think that uh
SPEAKER_04: he's going to become a very tough out for everybody left and right in the next year or two. I mean, he already is, but I think he's going to, and then, you know, people said as before, like he's the next guy that might give, um, or maybe Ravaz, uh, Levon a serious match. Um, so I think, I think Hermes has got a really tough match ahead of him. So you are saying Morozov is going to win? Yes. Lefty. I agree. And Giannis?
SPEAKER_00: Morozov pulled six weeks ago with Dadakyan in Dubai.
SPEAKER_00: during the during the competition it will be exactly uh seven weeks okay so yeah seven weeks ago it was it was top fight and uh also it was with left arm and also we saw that the morozo was not going inside at all and yeah but the main thing where he was not even trying to go inside because he was injured with his
SPEAKER_00: in a row and uh okay so seven weeks later it's still short time to to to get better so so it's he didn't use here during that match so just imagine that seven more weeks
SPEAKER_00: I don't think that he hurt inside of his elbow during that match because he was more like pronated, but who knows? Yeah, but we can also say, okay, it's maybe enough time to recover, but is it enough time to train that position and be strong if you haven't pulled two months or haven't two months trained but just recovered? But we will see that.
SPEAKER_00: uh hermes hermes left is is not as he's right but it's not bad as as well it's it's good he's right of course he's more dominant but he can be dangerous with his left uh for for both of them they are they are they are growing they are adding they are uh they are getting bigger every time i see them i like both of them but uh
SPEAKER_00: For me, it's a question of how much you can handle. Morozov is competing so often, every time in better and better shape. I don't think it's a big secret for anyone. He's like...
SPEAKER_00: Uh, he is not natural athlete and, uh, and to be on, on, on, uh, on, uh, something for all the time and, and to, to push your limits, to push your body to such a, such a stress for so long. It's questionable how much he can handle. He looks bigger. He looks, uh, stronger. We will see. I feel like, you know, his window is going to be short because of the decisions he's making with his body.
SPEAKER_04: but he's so young, I think that he's at the time where his body can take it. I think he's going to pay for it later, but the next couple of years are gonna be very successful for him. But I do agree with you in general, because of the decisions he's making, he's gonna have a shorter career. Yeah. And one thing I wanna add, Yanis, just because he didn't use that area during that match,
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't mean that he started that kind of rehabilitation and strengthening after that time. Maybe he had been doing it for two months. You understand? The healing process.
SPEAKER_00: And then that match he didn't use because he wasn't ready. After that match, he continued adding. You know what I mean, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It would be true. But also, I think it's... For anyone, it's not too smart to try to hook Hermes. I haven't seen many who has been able to hook Hermes, so it's... Maybe it's... Maybe also for Morozov, it's better to... Yeah, yeah. Keep going to the front. Remember when...
SPEAKER_01: morozov tried to top roll tobias he couldn't and then he beat him with you know with this and then the same tobias top roll rudnick um i don't know yeah it's yeah it's saying something of course but uh but it's we're talking about yeah again different styles different arms yeah it's it's it's good it's a good fight are you talking about different arms talking about hermes you mean
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah you're talking about right and left and i was saying no it's the same arm left arm yeah so who are you saying basically i didn't understand who is winning that match i i like uh who who was who when was there was pulling left arm last time when hermes was pulling his bottle and before that i remember him pulling krasimir
SPEAKER_00: in the the croche event or italy event or somewhere he's not pulling it often with left arm but when when he does he's doing good when he does he's doing good and uh and uh so it will be a battle of the hands
SPEAKER_00: absolutely absolutely i i i don't i don't think that uh ermis will go inside and i don't think that morozo will be able to get inside so it will be only about hand yeah for for me and uh ermis hand is very solid but same same same with morozo and uh but he can also has very strong hand but it only handled three rounds after three rounds he started you know
SPEAKER_01: losing so but here this best of five winning three times is enough we will see we will see i mean there's another match that you know with a big question mark for me yeah we can have a bet janice and if i pick morozov and you pick armies whoever loses has to uh okay the one who loses shaves his head exactly
SPEAKER_01: Tough to lose. Let's see if Mindaugas is going to lose his hair or Justin is going to lose his beard. We will see. I'm trying to decide who would look weirder. I feel like Justin without a beard is going to look weirder than Mindaugas. Yeah. Anyway, so let's move.
SPEAKER_00: couple more very very important match very important match again Artem Morozov versus Revas Lutize Georgians like Gennady and other Georgians they are saying that Revas is the most potential of all of them and that he could be like uh
SPEAKER_00: strongest georgian out there and then and that he could be even biggest uh challenge to lebanon that is what georgians are saying so uh and and it's it's always questionable how much we can believe but they are saying that the rebels is uh not even preparing too seriously and training just uh twice a week or once a week or so it's hard to believe in the past now
SPEAKER_01: Revas personally told me that, Engin, I have never taken arm wrestling super seriously. But he said, with your events, now I am taking seriously. And my goal is to be number one in the world. Right now, he's taking seriously.
SPEAKER_00: and the guy is huge he is and that's what also saying his teammates that his potential is uh still still still far far in front and that he could be much much better and uh if like like you said if he's taking if he's taking this those trainings really seriously yeah yeah because we could see and uh yeah i really do not know how it will be
SPEAKER_01: but if they both go outside versus outside i'm not saying who's going to win it's not prediction only saying stylistically if they both go outside you'll say round one fresh round i'm talking only fresh round i see rewa's better outside but i also see a possibility morozo who who they've cheffy to be able to hook right inside yeah possible it doesn't mean he will
SPEAKER_01: But I can see, like, if he hooks him, I kind of think that he's going to win. But if he cannot hook, and if the boat goes outside, I don't know. I kind of think that was maybe better outside, but who knows, you know? Who knows? Who knows? Yeah, yeah. Who knows? But, yeah, like, Morozov's...
SPEAKER_00: Hook ability seems better than Reba's. Reba is strong inside, but he's still focusing mostly on outside. And he was great with press, actually, with Michael, but still his outside game seems better. But inside, yeah, it's advantage for Morozov. I don't know who's going to win that match. I'm looking forward to watching it. I think it's going to be amazing, but I would hate to guess who's going to win it.
SPEAKER_01: have another super chat i don't know if you missed that and okay caroline yeah she says latvian power and undeniable probably they're not talking about you yes um janice will bowen ever beat coach ray and who are your top three in north america you like to pull janice uh
SPEAKER_00: Bowen could beat Coach Ray. It is possible. The difference is not so big. Will it happen? Who knows? Maybe. But in a previous Supermatch, Ray was very dominant. Yeah. And he was better. Who are my top favorites in the USA? No, to pull against. To pull against. Right now. Sam Harris. Sam Harris. Justin.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if Tony Kitovsky is still active. He said he cannot come back. I want to win against Adam Wilmot. I was so damaged after Joseph in a while and then Adam won against me. We have pulled before, I have won, but last time we met he beat me. Adam Wilmot, you know Adam? Angry bird.
SPEAKER_01: angry bird yeah exactly so uh i kind of have some history with him next time you come over he'll make that happen he does not live that far from me you can easily make that happen yeah yeah and my opinion in the same way 90 kilo bovine cannot beat dry monster both are in the way that they feel comfortable
SPEAKER_01: than Ryan beats Bowen beats, Ryan Bowen beats Ramos. Like the Ryan that today, in my opinion, would beat Ray, but in the same way, 90 kilo, I don't think he can beat Ray. I agree with that. I agree with that. Anyway, so let's move. A few matches left only. Ermes Gasparini, Dave Chaffee.
SPEAKER_01: Even to think about it, it just like blows your mind, right? Yeah. Just imagine that, you know, last few matches and Neil is there. And ladies and gentlemen, you know, Dave from United States and Hermes Gasparini from Italy. And then they come to the table. I'm going to be completely honest with you on this match. I think if this was a match a month ago,
SPEAKER_04: that I think Dave would win this match. But because Dave has been, you know, very vocal, but he feels like he needs to rest and recover. I think he has a lot of stuff going on. He will only have 10 days after the Latin match. I don't think. I think because because one month ago would be 10 days after his Latin match. Yeah, so I don't mean two months, whatever. I mean, I mean, I'm just giving you a hard time. I think I think if if
SPEAKER_04: If he was going to beat Ermes, I think he would beat Ermes. Right now, I think Ermes has an edge, but obviously, I love Dave and I want Dave to win, but I feel that Ermes has an edge today or will have an edge on Saturday just because of the accumulated injuries and mileage on Dave's arm and his neck and stuff, but nothing would make me happier next week than for Dave to win. Of all the people that I'm
SPEAKER_00: pulling for Dave is the one I want to win the most but I enjoy I just feel that army says an edge Dave said he will be 100 on that day that's hopefully hopefully yeah that's what he would like to see but uh after after such fight he had with uh Vitaly I I couldn't uh couldn't uh recover for a month at all probably it's it's a it's crazy to to pull out of your position without and
SPEAKER_01: Genetic freak. I said, did you have any injury? He said, no, he was sore. And that's all. But he said he's recovered. And I kind of believe that I kind of take those kind of things, very good preparation for the future if you totally recover. Because once you recover, you seem like you didn't train for three weeks. But in fact, that is a perfect recovery after such a super performance, you understand? And then once you recover, you are like rock.
SPEAKER_01: You know, in my opinion, that people think that that three weeks is like waste. It's not waste. It is the perfect house of progress after such as such as long as he's he doesn't have any pain. And OK, what's your take, Yanis?
SPEAKER_00: dave dave is always for me very strength based armor slur and uh usually in a fight when someone stops him and and gets some advantage dave is dave dave is done only time when when i was surprised and i believe he
SPEAKER_00: himself was very surprised with his fight with Vitaly when he was losing and after that he was able to get back on a winning and fight in advantage for him. But usually when I see Dave pulling, when someone finds some point where he can beat him, I think because he's
SPEAKER_00: he's strong he's super strong but it sometimes doesn't matter when i saw some of his videos he's doing in a gym with some wrist range it doesn't matter which side he's wrapping his wrist range he's just just doing some crazy number weights and and he's super strong but i don't see him as a best technical armistice for example if we compare that with hermes i think hermes is one of
SPEAKER_00: rare super heavyweights which are very good technically he he he knows how to arm muscle one of the best top roller on the earth one of the best top rollers on the earth even he is a supreme yeah i'm i'm not i'm not saying best or not best but he he he's really good technically and and that could make a difference and and it again again it will be fight for hand for wrist
SPEAKER_00: dave dave is super strong but uh most likely he will go for top roll as well he will not go inside and he i don't think he will get inside it will be in his traps and uh they will be doing outer side pressure you know yeah yeah that's that's how dave could pull yeah but it will be it will be in straps and the question who will have this hand control yeah
SPEAKER_00: usually usually usually usually yeah airmas need more releases with all finger risk pronator control dave could go really with uh also a little bit lost restore riser just push to side but uh with all that with all that uh and also remember all all that crazy fight just seven weeks ago i think airbus has advantage um would you agree if if
SPEAKER_01: Like for example, Hermes gets this much of cup, he's going to win that match because I don't think Dave can control Hermes' pronator with his wrist. And the only way for Dave to go sideways to protect his pronator and Hermes to do this much of wrist means that he will have some control over Dave's pronator and then he will slow down his side pressure. But if
SPEAKER_01: the wrist is not like this, but just totally flat like this. And if they stay both like this, I kind of give the edge to Dave, because Dave is more used to pulling this way without having this, while Hermes is someone that always have, you know, full control of the wrist. And so I think that it is, everything will be up to Hermes' wrist.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, absolutely. It's not enough for Hermes just to do back pressure. He needs to control his hand with the ringer rotator, for sure. And if he can control that rotator-pronator, he will win. Dave cannot hook him. There is no way that Dave can...
SPEAKER_00: control here is incredible you know yeah i don't i don't think so if if if we look from historical fights uh ermis lost against kurdecha and kurdecha lost against dave so it's kind of like uh kind of like uh simple mathematics makes uh advantage for dave but uh we don't know which shape they are now
SPEAKER_01: yeah exactly we are talking about yeah but uh absolutely i agree with you as well yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let's see let's see let's see i think i mean you will be incredible you want to think about those matches it is too much too too much for
SPEAKER_01: uh an armless infant to handle you know all those you know that wow i mean we can never know sometimes uh sometimes like huge match and you expect something and then it's like okay it was good but that's it some other fight could be so great that you are remembering and talking about that but to find out the answer is also very important like because you don't know who's gonna win two big names you know mike tyson was one of the most
SPEAKER_01: exciting armistice usually one round two round it was like out you know and just but he was i mean so for me is like if there is a war it's incredible but for me to find answer to see who is where you understand where is hermes
SPEAKER_01: Where is Dave? If Hermes dominates him, this is also you will think, okay, this guy is ready. Or Levan, you know, I mean, if he can beat Dave that way, or if Dave dominates him. And then I asked to Levan, I said, would you pull, because you pull against Devon with the rules, the direct strap after 30 seconds, would you pull the same rule? He said, yes, he's ready. And then I said this to Dave, he was so happy. He said, let's go, you know. And this was what people wanted to see.
SPEAKER_01: You understand? Yeah, that much. So we don't know. For me, like right now, a lot of questions. For me, if there are like wars, I will be very happy. But we will find out a lot of answers that we don't really know right now. So let's go last two matches. John Burzin, Petrenko. Petrenko. I would like to see John win. But I mean, I've been watching Petrenko a lot.
SPEAKER_04: his power level is scary and his diversity and pulling reminds me of John and the extent that he's really strong in a lot of different positions. And I think that's why he probably, you know, him saying like the new generation kind of thing. I think he probably sees a little bit of, of John and himself because he's so good in many angles and that he can never count John out, especially if the match, any of the matches are hard. But I think Golik has, has an advantage in this. I think, um,
SPEAKER_00: would love to see john win obviously but um i think for me petrenko's is going to win this one yeah petrenko is saying that he's yeah like we thought before stronger than ever but uh
SPEAKER_00: uh if if we talk about uh similar shape at rank always so against raymond santanovich then uh no i yeah i i i would doubt that uh such a shape petrenko could could win against uh uh john brzenk with all my biggest respect to my team and dry months uh i i still uh not not like uh saying that raymond is on level with john i still always see john uh much much higher so but
SPEAKER_00: of course he's young he's uh he's uh preparing very seriously as we can see and uh he he will be in his best shape and uh he's super dangerous we have seen before how great he was in his lottie uh in 95 kilo class and uh but also also it's john and uh
SPEAKER_00: you you it's it's it's a that's that's that's the beauty of of those uh great armistice it's so hard to bet against them it's it's it's they always find something else when it's necessary and then john is you you you put put somewhere this uh limit and you think that's it he can't do any more but he always finds something else and and with john absolutely
SPEAKER_00: Can he win against? Yes, he can. You can never say that, John. Even in his previous fight against Ongar Bayo, I think with maybe a little bit different tactical game, John still could win. Yeah. Guys, a call came, and then whenever the call came, the sound went bad, so I will get out and come in a second. Yeah, we can talk and we don't need you anymore.
SPEAKER_00: yeah plenty of knowledge what does he know anyway yeah we can we can we can be selfish linguistic and then talk about like our self-heart what we are doing honestly not only about others like who cares like who who don't i don't know i don't know how you are doing how you did it well that's that's that's interesting he's back already that was fast
SPEAKER_01: yeah we just started to make fun of you and you already you came back so now we have to stop can i not turn my back to you guys anyway so caroline says engine would you ever combine two events like bodybuilding men's and women's and arm resting to boost both sports on stage to both fans said um it's possible because uh in my country the federation is the same preparation yeah
SPEAKER_01: bodybuilding and bodybuilding fitness and arm wrestling federation but i need to discuss this with my uh friends thank you for your uh super chat and and janice do you agree that uh to beat john i mean the strength alone sometimes is not the key but the the control like hongar was tall and technical enough like very dangerous opponent for john while
SPEAKER_01: Oleg is very strong, maybe even stronger than Ongarbe, but more predictable and more orthodox, you understand, way. Ongarbe is also orthodox way, but he's just like, he's like an artist, you know, like he's incredible about like, not many people can pull, even when Prudik tried to top roll him in top eight, when they both go outside versus outside, Prudik lost his wrist, you know, and so,
SPEAKER_01: So I don't think that Petrenko, because of his height and because of the way that he is pulling, I don't think it's dangerous for John, but he is strong. So John will have his chance to apply his power.
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely. I'm not saying that Petrenko is not dangerous. He's very dangerous. But I see also that John has some good chances to do good. And I see that Petrenko's hand before has been flopped back. And it is possible. It is possible. And John could catch him, especially in a longer game.
SPEAKER_01: i don't know about john's endurance lately but uh petrenko's endurance is not great in in a super match format and uh i don't know what i just say that shortly ongar wave stylistically is more dangerous opponent for john yeah yeah yeah this is what i want to say okay let's go to the last match devon lara then brudnick we saw yanis sharing his uh opinion
SPEAKER_01: think last night was it yeah yeah yeah two days ago i think we recorded it or it yesterday yeah yeah yesterday yeah it was let's start with josh well i i have a i have a very clear opinion on this one i'm curious where yours was janice because i didn't see it but i think um prudnik is going to win easily that's my opinion did you guys see the the footage
SPEAKER_00: you janice no i was not watching no i i saw just photo but i i i thought it's probably not real video so i even didn't watch it yeah but you had the chance to watch no i didn't oh you don't have the video i i have it i haven't seen uh just just i i saw that there are some video but i thought uh
SPEAKER_01: it's like uh too short before fight is that there is any way they will not put any real fights there so i didn't watch no no that's not on youtube that's private that i saw it okay okay okay yeah yeah and and josh you are saying that he's gonna win easily and and can you remind us your opinion
SPEAKER_00: uh what i'm thinking is that uh uh evgeny is uh generally stronger evgeny's arm probably is better than john's he's he's more explosive he's uh younger he's growing and uh i see many advantage in in in in uh evgeny but uh
SPEAKER_00: Also, when we compare his historical fights with Todd Hutchings, with Matt Mask, we can see how dominant Yevgeny was against them.
SPEAKER_00: from other way of course it's history but how fights when Devon pulled Evgeny Todd Hutchings how he was struggling we could say and then always war with Matt Mask it's all some different fights and for Devon what I see
SPEAKER_00: What I see Devon's chance is, or probably where I see he could win, is to stop Evgeny in this defensive pronated position and maybe separate a little bit away that arm from body and stop it.
SPEAKER_00: theoretically theoretically uh from from last all those fights it seems like it's advantage for uh for evgeny and also we know that uh devon has have to cut weight it maybe it's not a much but still he have to cut some weight three four kilos three four kilos
SPEAKER_00: uh it's it's still but but we also know that uh uh even cutting few kilos could be could be different but we know what knows that the day one day one before has pulled in a hundred seven hundred eight hundred ten kilo and then being successful while under two kilo 225. yeah yeah as well when when he pulled when he pulled against john brzenk when he pulled against andre puskar he was under one one tenth
SPEAKER_01: But it was a long time ago. In arm wars, he was 245, like 111, 12 or something. I remember, yeah. But again, yeah, I mean, he can do that. But 115 kilo, no way that it is like killing the devil at all, you know. And it was Friday morning, and the Saturday evening, he's going to pull. The only thing is, the start, I think, is very, very important. And you reminded us, his match with Tata Shinx, his match with
SPEAKER_01: Matt mask, but you know, this, this type of pullers, someone like Devon, whenever the arm heals, some parts you can use this guy, these guys can make some radical changes in their pulling styles. So I kind of see Devon coming more to the table, you know, with time, you know, and, and even when I saw him training with
SPEAKER_01: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, He he wasn't going down, you know he was just like maybe like this, not even this, but like at the table, but a little bit open and so. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, There was no start and before the start, there was a lot of.
SPEAKER_00: know just warm-up type training is training you know they want uh probably devil can pull anyone in training and uh it seems like he's struggling but uh competition is always different story we don't know and uh
SPEAKER_00: that's it will be it will be buff referees it will be maybe more strict but what they will need is this little pulling before start already loading Yevgeny's finger but it's so hard Yevgeny is so tricky as well on table and
SPEAKER_00: I don't know who will be a referee in this fight, like Hristo or Oleg, or who will be a referee in this fight, but I believe they will be sweating for 30 minutes before the fight will start. I think Prudnik is the first person that Devin has pulled in a long time
SPEAKER_04: who is just as cagey and just as smart on the table as he is and can do all the same kind of games and mind games and playing around the grip as good or even better than Devin. So that part fascinates me. And I really, I'm looking forward to that setup battle. And I think it's going to mess with Devin's head a little bit. Because, you know, Prudnik is so good in so many different places like Devin. And I just think everything that Jana said, I completely agree with.
SPEAKER_04: But I'm really looking forward to that setup fight because it is going to be really fun to watch. Also, we need to know who was intimidated by the practice pool. Who knows? I don't think either of them will be. They both know the deal. Like Yana said with practice, I feel like it's just a game. And they both know they're going to find out on Saturday. I know more, but I'm not going to share it. It's not my place.
SPEAKER_01: and yeah I don't know I kind of see both of them very smart both of them are well rounded they can pull in any position I see one with incredible explosiveness the other one is incredible endurance so we will it will be up to which is game will be
SPEAKER_00: but you again you believe like uh fresh against fresh uh they won't they won't can uh can uh fight even with with you right now if you talk about arm strength to go against the arm or go inside with this i mean the the the the the one doesn't really pull with bicep like this but he just puts his uh body behind and you know and yeah i go like somebody like this
SPEAKER_01: I have heard that whenever he pulled with Sonev, Jordan Sonev in Europe somewhere. Yes, in Germany. What people told me that Devon already pulled for some days, every day. I don't know for a few days, but he was pulling for two hours at least before that when he met with Jordan. He was pulling for two hours. I was going to come there.
SPEAKER_01: Early in the day, he pulled, pulled, pulled. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was pulling every day. Even that day earlier, he was pulling. And then he pulled against Jordan. So his hook is not really a bicep hook, but he can put his body weight over somebody's bicep and can block. But without making his shoulder not like this, you know, at the start, he needs to be spared. Until he comes there,
SPEAKER_01: maybe he will get flashed, you understand? But once he puts his shoulder behind like this, I think it can be very dangerous. It depends like where, I mean, the match will stop, you understand? If he can get his move or before he gets moved because
SPEAKER_00: Rudnick is just like this. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like, I don't think in fresh against fresh he can get on this, on Yevgeny's bicep. He will be the one who will be in that holding position, in defensive position. And that's why what only I see is that he needs to catch more on this pronator than go against arm. Otherwise he will get flashed. I think he will try outside first.
SPEAKER_01: For sure. In the East versus West, we say WAF rules, but you both know that it is not like strict WAF rules. We don't foul people because they don't hold or move or something. We make sure that they start correct, but we don't foul out because of moving or something. And another thing, we said this already before, any slip is not a parallel pin.
SPEAKER_01: your winning side you understand or other guys lose inside if it is not by any sleep as long as your elbow is on the pad is step so kind of looks like the match is gonna go uh to yeah most likely and most likely in steps and advantage for advantage for uh day one i think
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So what happens is that Brutnik needs to be very careful to not to spend even this much of power before the goal. And Devon needs to make sure that he loads it enough before the goal, because he's zero to 60 miles is not that quick. And the other guys, zero to 60 is super fast, but once it goes to the horsepower,
SPEAKER_00: then this guy that doesn't have a good 0-60 has much more endurance, you know. When I say horsepower, I don't mean... It's no question. It's no question. If the fight will stop in the center and be there for like a few seconds, every second after that, it's more advantage for Devin, for sure. I don't know. I mean, remember, Prindik used to have those really, really long matches with Zolove and Sasha year after year at WAF. But his endurance is excellent as well. As well, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: listen this this guy josh i i'm convinced that there is no human being that is like like they will not i'm convinced with that that that guy is about endurance that guy is not normal you know i understand i don't know yannis do you agree with that that that guy in an equal position you know in an equal position he he sucks your blood you know just you know he even takes your spirit you know
SPEAKER_00: i i i don't know uh just just right now we haven't we haven't seen anyone who has been able in that uh long fights to really be like uh successful against the devil maybe there are someone who is i don't know but we haven't seen we haven't seen yeah i mean until until i see uh i mean uh once i saw that even pat hashings quickly gassed out against him
SPEAKER_01: And I was like, wow, that match should be, you know, like forever, you know, it shouldn't be ending that quick, you know. But it didn't end quick. But once Devon get, bring it to do like a neutral position, the medium, you know, middle of the table, then everything was all over, you know. Yeah. The guy is different, you know. So we will see. We will see how quick. I don't know if Brittany can beat him without the strap so quickly or for sure it's going to be.
SPEAKER_01: strap match, you know, and I'm going to talk with the athletes front of the cameras about the rules. I don't want anyone to complain after that. I will talk with the referees, also referees. Everyone needs to do their job, you know, athletes, referee, everyone. So I don't want, because if anything happens, people just start poking, gives me a headache, you know. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. And there is one more super chat.
SPEAKER_01: Caroline, Joshua, do you think Austin Jaegers could beat any European in his weight class? I'm sure he would beat any Europeans, he asked you, but to which level? I don't know. He beat Myrtilla at Arnold's last year, so he definitely can. He pulled Myrtilla at Arnold's last year. From Azerbaijan. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah he's strong he's a good armistead he's strong good armistead probably probably not yet uh to fight with with like top very top or top three or top six europeans but uh definitely yeah could be somewhere in this yeah absolutely yeah yeah anyways guys thank you very very much janice are you coming uh no not this time oh not this time yeah you'll miss you
SPEAKER_00: When you said that Klaas is coming, for a moment I started to think maybe I should check flights. Who is coming? Klaas from Sweden. Oh, Klaas, yeah, yeah. Klaas Martinsson. You can come. I mean, you can stay together with me. There's no problem.
