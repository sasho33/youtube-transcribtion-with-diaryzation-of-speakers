SPEAKER_04: Oh, there's the sign, we cannot talk trash. Can't let me.
SPEAKER_04: okay so so far it actually looks like me in your life so i don't know if engen met for that to happen but oh engen is here too all right we are live i'm just trying to make the connection and now we are live i think um with the youtube i was trying to connect and devon just showed tom up so it means he's coming soon i'm here reading the chat so if you don't want to i'm here
SPEAKER_01: yeah but you you can join as well you don't not only because of reading the chat but we are we are live so for those who just joined we are waiting on demo layer to start a discussion yeah that that that's interesting that you know just god already god already has his um
SPEAKER_01: as i said you know pen and paper he made all his notes and the guy is just i can't believe that you watch all those hours of videos you know it's incredible you know it yeah it it actually sounds easier than it is it it's hard when you're watching them
SPEAKER_03: to note because if they felt start or something, I mean, a lot of times I go, okay, I can't remember if they're in a ref trip or not in a ref trip. And sometimes you miss who wins because they don't always have a scorecard. So I go, oh, this guy won. And then I pull it back and then restart it. I go, oh, I don't remember if I wrote it correctly. So I have to go back and watch it again. Who is this young guy? Hey!
SPEAKER_01: Okay, is my internet bad or good? Do you see me like without any cut or? I'm watching on live and you look good. Okay, I know I look good, but I'm just talking. No, like it's smooth. The picture is there. It's all good. Yes. Are we live right now? Hello everyone. Today we meet to discuss about if the strap buckle is disadvantage or not.
SPEAKER_01: and we have here Devon Marat and we have Tata Chins looks like they have opposite opinions and we have Artem Taranenko to help us and hello Devon how are you hey guys i'm sorry i'm just i'm very excited to be here today yeah i'm running all around like crazy sorry but i'm paying very much attention i promise
SPEAKER_01: what are you doing well is that toilet paper yeah yeah yeah it's toilet paper i gotta i gotta blow my nose i always have to okay okay that's good if it's about your nose it's okay we can't handle that nothing okay okay okay so i want to i want to start
SPEAKER_01: because I have watched what you guys are thinking. So I want to say my opinion about it first. I don't see this subject as like playing if it is disadvantage or not at all. I think that the pulling styles, my opinion, pulling styles makes difference. If both guys are going outside, I think buckle is disadvantage.
SPEAKER_01: If both guys are going inside, probably it is the minimum, minimum effect. If one is going out, the other one is trying to hook, depending, maybe putting some pressure to the wrist and like to pronate it a little bit more. But, so I think that all those match, first of all, Tatasic did an incredible job. I mean, it is an incredible thing that he did it, but it is, it should be used as a base
SPEAKER_01: then it should be detailed, you know, after this one. And another thing that I want to say, I don't think that only by the result of the match we can judge exactly if it's his disadvantage or not. Because it can give you advantage from the wrist and pronation, but you can still beat a guy without the wrist, you know. It doesn't help you to gain finishing pressure power, you know.
SPEAKER_01: So, like, it actually made top roll Todd Hutchings, but Todd still can press him. So, like, we cannot come to a conclusion that, you know, because it gives advantage of the wrist and pronator, in my opinion. But the winning or not winning the match is not dependent only this. So, this is my opinion, and you guys can go ahead. Can we start with some history first?
SPEAKER_02: yeah can we can we put to bed that we all agree that there's a massive difference between the old strap which we can call the hustle strap and the new strap which we can call the fair strap yeah there's a difference it's a big difference right yeah there is a difference but it's still in my opinion doesn't provide like equally but i mean to i mean i will tell you honestly i came to this age
SPEAKER_01: until you guys like discuss about this i never noticed that advantage disadvantage and i know he will not sound polite but i have very solid wrist so it did not so much make difference with me just watch my match with arthur round one the last time we pulled round two even both times i took his wrist easily but that was the new strap
SPEAKER_01: I understand. But still, even even the before all my career, you know, my wrist always had the control, you know, so for a solid wrist, it didn't really make difference because it only it only matters when it's close. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did. I can agree. I can agree. But what is your description? Like, it matters. Like, would it put pressure to your wrist? You cannot apply pronator. Like, how do you see that exactly?
SPEAKER_02: to me to me it's it's very simple the whole the whole strap discussion to me is very very simple and i am and it will and i'm glad we get to talk about it because i am so convicted in my belief of it and uh it will be a pleasure to debate this with you guys um because when i saw todd put his um
SPEAKER_02: this video out well it's it's a subject that greatly interests me and obviously data does not lie but there's also i think i think that there's just a division point that we we have to kind of frame the discussion and and i and i would say that it would be good if we could all kind of look at what happened before now when we talked about the old strap the hustle strap
SPEAKER_02: the reason why i used to and i know that i'm not the only one run and try and get that side of the table and that's why it mattered so much in coin flips because in the old style system so the way i see the strap coming into play is obviously there's interface between the hands right any part that touches between two athletes there's an interface
SPEAKER_02: and there's also interface face with the strap you are applying pressure to a strap and that strap is in turn applying pressure to your opponent through the strap or you know and the and the thing that i notice is the way that the strap binds and what i will what i observe is that when the match initiates
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so there's two parts. There's the setup and there's the initiation. And the setup remains basically unchanged in both systems for the advantage. But what happens when they say go in the old system to me is just so huge because when the straps start to come apart,
SPEAKER_02: based off of like so like a like a triangle the greatest distance is the farther you go down right like the the farther you go down off the wrist the bigger the distance and so it catches first so the bottom strap in the in the hustle strap or the old-fashioned strap runs from uh the person without the buckle so the person without the buckle it runs from their wrist
SPEAKER_02: It's the bottom strap, and then it goes to the opponent's hand. So this is the first strap to bind. It's the first one to come under pressure. So what that means is that the highest tension point in the strap goes from the wrist to the hand of the opponent. And that's why I always said it's like 15%. It's huge. To me, it's so perceivable. The way that you, like if you're attacking a person's hand,
SPEAKER_02: with the hustle strap it's so easy it's so easy to do um to me it's to have the discussion about it is is interesting but i'm so concluded and i would love to start there if anybody has any retort to that statement you are saying the 15 difference with the old size strip and then what's the difference with the new one okay so the the new one
SPEAKER_02: It's symmetrical, okay? Except for one thing. So the symmetry in the new strap is completely fair. So what happens is in the new strap now, the base strap, the bottom strap, the first strap to bind goes from the inside of the wrist to the inside of the wrist, okay? So that's even. All the straps run a symmetrical pattern, okay, in the fair strap.
SPEAKER_02: they all do but the bottom one is is where all the discussion needs to be first of all so inside to inside so that's that's a fair bind the only difference is in the tightening process and and to me having a buckle is irrelevant the buckle to me doesn't matter it's the the way that the strap becomes tightened that allows a manipulation to happen by any kind of
SPEAKER_02: mid-level skilled arm wrestler and that is in the uh well when you tighten the strap the one guys gets the hand gets pulled down slightly other guys get hand gets pulled up slightly which which is really now if reffed properly and accurately is very much minimized and um it has the fair strap has the potential to be in my opinion extremely fair if not taken advantage of however it will be taken advantage of but the difference is
SPEAKER_02: because it's still a symmetrical wrap it it's it's just what you can kind of get away with and pullers if they negotiate well it shouldn't it should be minimized um but there still is an issue in my in my mind like I would still if I was having a match I would still want to not have the buck because of that before Todd Todd answers all of this I will ask you something you know how do you call it in English sorry my English when there is no buckle but when
SPEAKER_02: I've seen different velcros. I've seen velcros that pass through a buckle and then it's no different.
SPEAKER_01: but if you just think alcohol system it's fine it's just it's just it won't tighten very well those those that's not what listen when there's buckle here and then when you type it you know this it is there there is a one single point that actually just put in pressure right right here you understand it is not yeah but once you know you you to move just wait we talk to buckle you to move in the like strap like this and then whenever you have this
SPEAKER_02: then you tighten on it tighten on it and then there is something here at this point that is actually really putting some pressure there yeah so then yeah i don't notice that one so much i i notice the pathway the pathway of the strap regardless if it's through a buckle or fabric to me it's about the pathway and where where those points uh give you better leverage you know
SPEAKER_01: And so long as the wrap is even, it doesn't matter to me if it's fabric or a buckle. The buckle only makes a difference because of the way it tightens and the way you get to take advantage of that tightening process. You tighten the strap, and there is something there in that point that is putting pressure there. And then it doesn't slide. Your hand doesn't slide in it, like doesn't move in it as it is moving if it is only the strap. There is a certain pressure. The strap is going like this, the other side.
SPEAKER_01: It's just going like this. But here, there is a tightness. They tight it, and then there is some pressure. OK, this is when the two guys are going outside. That is the difference I noticed. But again, I said I personally don't feel so much. OK, Todd, you listened a lot. Thank you for your patience. And just go ahead. All right. Let's start with the more interesting terms about
SPEAKER_02: like one one section of the strap tightening before the others or how it's set up when you apply the strap you very easily can load the two hands differently you can load the bottom strap can pull tighter up and that's only because the only way you can have an imbalance in the strap tension is due to the friction of the strap touching the competitor's hand if the straps free to move around then the tensions equal all the way through
SPEAKER_02: when they apply the strap if you're in a free grip and you can move your hands around all that tension gets relieved all the unequal tension gets relieved and the straps doing nothing but applying compression if you are in a rough strip but even in a rough strip there's some moving because you can tell the ref no lower it here you know you move your shoulders but even if you are perfectly frozen when they put the strap on and there was that
SPEAKER_02: um uneven and tension between several segments of the strap as soon as they said go and you move that straps allowed to slide and then the strap goes from applying um unequal sections of tension to just come so the strap might start out unequal but it's going to be equal tensions once you've pulled
SPEAKER_02: And if there is a disadvantage to the buckle, and if it's anywhere near 15%, you would expect to see a lot more flash pins in the strap. Because if I'm 15% stronger than you, that's an incredible difference. If I'm two or 3% stronger than you, that's an incredible difference.
SPEAKER_02: Just to put it in context, if I'm 4% or 5% stronger than you and we're in a weightlifting competition, you hit your max, I still have two more attempts because a percentage point or two is a big difference between two players. You don't see a lot of flash pins in this draft.
SPEAKER_02: But, and I agree that it's not the buckle itself that matters. I only call it the buckle to distinguish buckle side versus non-buckle side. You know, we don't really have sexy names for which side of the table you're on. The hustle strap versus the fair strap, I just flat do not see a difference.
SPEAKER_02: in the win-loss percentage of you know between the hustle strap and the fair strap i looked at 148 mats well i looked at the 1990 tournament and a 2004 tournament which was pre fair strap and then i looked at the fair strap tournament which was the wl 500 series before that i looked at the 2004 unified nationals and a 1990 tournament
SPEAKER_02: in Canada, and there the buckle versus strap was almost equal. It was like a 9% difference at 1990 and a 2% difference in 2004. In the WAL 500 season, the buckle actually won 13% more matches than the non-buckle side did.
SPEAKER_02: So buckle side versus non-buckle side. In the WAL, using the fair strap, the buckle side actually won 13% more than the non-buckle side. So it didn't make it fair, but all that indicates is that these small sample sizes, maybe the statistics don't apply.
SPEAKER_02: we don't talk about the strap is just one difference between the two, whether it's distinct or not, but nobody ever talks about if there's a lucky side to the table, because even if you're not in the straps, a certain side of the table may or may not win more than the other, depending on whether you face the rep or not. I think that was all the points that were made. I just don't see
SPEAKER_02: If the buckle only matters, if two people are completely equal and doing the same move at a certain condition, then it really doesn't matter at all. The other thing is, is the styles change anyways. Just putting a match in a ref strip or putting a match in a strap almost forces the two pullers to pull differently than they would if they were in a free grip anyway.
SPEAKER_02: which is why I wouldn't analyze any results that had amateurs or beginners in it because they would just do other stuff. Obviously, if you're in a strap, you're gonna pull a little bit differently just because you don't have the flexibility to have one before. But if any professional level puller mitigates any effects of the strap or the table side, then it doesn't matter in a professional level arm wrestling. I'd love to answer.
SPEAKER_02: Go ahead. So I agree with a lot of what you said, Todd. First off, the 15%, I'm probably wrong on my numbers. Okay, 15, whatever. To me, it's significant. And this 15% quote for me, this is with the hustle strap. It is not with the fair strap. The fair strap, I agree with you.
SPEAKER_02: Once the advantage you get in the setup is negated, it's completely even. It's completely even. I personally don't fuss that much. I'm not that worried if I don't get it with the fair strap system. And I believe it is completely even and fair, except for the advantages that you can gain in the set. The data from...
SPEAKER_02: from the old way i would be so shocked if if you could gather all of it and you couldn't prove i remember a match like this is completely anecdotal evidence but you remember uh ual when we all got together when marvin stuff crashed yeah you remember that match between janice amelins and uh bishop yeah yeah so they went up the table
SPEAKER_02: i saw bishop uh i saw yannis had the buckle and i bet bob brown like 100 bucks i'm like he's gonna beat him this time that can be because that back then they were using the old the old rap and it can be enough it can be enough to make a big difference um let me see where else were you going oh um pulling styles
SPEAKER_02: I don't think it makes a difference whether you're your top or your bottom, just because I just think the ability to negotiate is greater when you're you're just like you said, with the friction like you are getting pulled up, your webbing will it will be easy if you are a guy who's trying in the set to either climb higher or go deeper. It will be easier to do this
SPEAKER_02: during the tightening process when you do not have the buckle i agree i'm just saying that while they're applying it the strap can have unequal tensions in its different section but i agree as soon as there's any movement in the hands that uneven intention disappears and the strap does nothing but apply compression and i totally agree with you
SPEAKER_02: So if the advantage is just at the setup, whether it's 3% or 15%, then I would expect the non-national side. It's only in the setup in the fairer strap. In the hustle strap, that percentage remains always. Okay. So I looked at the 1990 Trout Creek Tournament and the 2004 Unified Nationals.
SPEAKER_02: And in both cases, the buckle side won more than the non-buckle side. Yeah. With a non-fair strike. I would say, let's do a statistical study in Ontario. I don't know where Trout Creek is, but Mike Gould was in it. Really? Yeah. And it was 1990, so it was a young Mike Gould. But on 17 to 14...
SPEAKER_02: And in the 2004 Nationals, the buckle won 24 to 23, which is dead even because you can't have a half number of matches. But even then, you would expect more flash pins.
SPEAKER_02: yeah strap matches aren't usually flash pins I mean there's not a predominance of flash pins with the buckle within straps there's not a there's not a significant more number of flash pins in straps if anything I don't know this but I'd be willing to bet that there are less flash pins in the straps this part I don't understand when you guys say that gives advantage like I mean
SPEAKER_01: do you think that it is about the risk losing the wrist or not or something why would it be a flash pin like that that flash pin is about the pressure that you're applying there not always the case that you know i mean the risk position i mean you may have the risk position but the pinning may be problematic but again you know with 15 i mean you are way off that one uh i know i know you you don't think that you know it's 15 now you are changing but um like whenever somebody
SPEAKER_01: arm wrestling is like an explosive strength you know and then especially the start and the weightlifters when they do 150 kilo they lift and then when they do for a record 152 and a half kilo it is only 1.7 percent and they go and then they can't even lift it it's 1.7 percent so at your max that five percent fifteen percent you would just kill a guy
SPEAKER_01: well i think that it does make a big difference okay it might not be okay even the five percent is big difference that's what you meant it gives you a difference to change the result of the match is what you are saying 100 okay and then when you are saying that the pulling style when the both guys are going top row or one guy is going i'm saying i'm saying with the hustle strap with the old-fashioned wrap yeah it doesn't it doesn't matter what you do
SPEAKER_01: it doesn't matter any way any look okay if both guys are just both slamming in their shoulders pressure do you get the pressure on your wrist what is the advantage of the thing yeah you'll take the guy's wrist way easier if both guy is going inside then then how could it be advantage okay listen
SPEAKER_02: If both guys are just pressing and that's it, okay, there might not be an issue with the strap. But as soon as there's any kind of a separation between the wrists. You mean any kind of pronation? Any kind. It doesn't even matter if it's pronation or supine. If they're coming apart, if there's any kind of pulling going on where the wrists will naturally create distance, the bottom strap goes from the wrist to the hand. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: and it's just that simple it's going from the wrist to the hand and you let me pull on somebody's hand with my wrist it's a big difference i try it try it like i mean i try with my students you know we tried both go outside because i i never paid attention before you know i have a long career you know i pulled probably 5 000 times buckle side 5 000 times the other side but
SPEAKER_01: uh we tried you know we tried and then when we both go outside the where the buckle is that guy just is less effective you know but when the guy had the buckle on his hand you know i i tried to topple i can move here much better you know we thought we talked to i mean a little bit more free movement there yeah in my opinion it's got nothing to do with the buckle and except for when we talk the tightening process it just has to do the path of the strap
SPEAKER_02: and and if you go hustle it's just it's huge you can't get away from it there's no cheat that can beat it like i can have the hustle strap and just pull and just set up like a dummy and let a person have everything and i would still have the advantage just based off of the path of the strap you can't cheat it you can't cheat now if if the guy's a good arm wrestler just gets even worse but fair strap
SPEAKER_02: to me is very even you can just cheat it better and and look at like i i think the answer is we have to come up with a new strap we do um it's just that this is so convenient like look i mean i i got this thing ready to go like it's it's always here like it's very convenient it's cheap it's easy but it's not perfect it's not so okay question is since we did we change the strap then
SPEAKER_04: and if you are thinking that there is not much difference now what are we talking about now we actually had two we actually had two euro super chats says genius is out there get rid of the buckle somehow it's it's i think there's maybe some kind of a loop system or like i know we've been of i i know that
SPEAKER_02: i went through a big strap push like five years ago or six years ago when the wal was going on live television and we were trying to come up with something that was faster because it takes it takes a good referee you know i don't know maybe 45 seconds to apply a strap and that's way too long i have a question for you said that the sticky one doesn't tight enough you know many times when we want to when we want to uh just like not to
SPEAKER_01: tight the buckle, we just put in them with Tom's, you know, we just hold it in. Right? That is holding. So what if we just Yeah, but it's holding because you're holding it yourself. I understand. But you know, when you are muscle, you will also be holding yourself. But what I'm just saying if it is also that that's that sticky thing, you know, I don't know how you call it. And if the help comes to this side, and the other help comes to other guys side, and then you also have Tom and your grip, you know, why not?
SPEAKER_01: Well, if there's a buckle, is there a buckle in it? No, no, no. You don't understand my point. I know the system. Yeah, they're good. It's just, in my opinion, it's just not tight enough. You'll come out of it. You can really tight and from both sides, the help of them will be this side and the help of them here. And then you will have your thumb and your grip and everything. So then we will have that. I think that the buckle thing, you think that it doesn't make difference? I think it is putting pressure that this is,
SPEAKER_02: my opinion, you know, it is something is holding you there, you know, but I mean, I would agree with you very simply and say, anytime there's a not symmetrical setup, there's, there's a problem. And, and, and whatever we believe in what the buckle does or doesn't do, one guy has it and one guy doesn't. And that shouldn't be the case. If one guy has it, the other guy should have it. And two buckles, even though we all know it's a more fair tightening process and it's symmetrical,
SPEAKER_02: it's kind of in my opinion it's not the right answer because of the administrative crap to it it's just it's just not worth it i think that there's a more simple way to do it um yeah i don't know okay todd you are not in so you must have a lot of things to say well only that um if you can't prove there's a
SPEAKER_02: advantage in our current strap, how would you prove the new straps any better? I mean, people can have opinions and preferences, but you didn't actually, if you can't recreate the problem and solve it, then you didn't really, uh, you can't prove that you actually solved the problem.
SPEAKER_02: if there was a problem in strap matches due to the buckle or not, instead of changing the strap, you could just make people pull every strap match is pulled twice, one on each side, or the buckle switched to side, and then you used to allow draws. A lot of sports have draws. Well, that's why we do it. We do switch sides of the table. But you'd still have an odd number of matches. You can still pull with the buckle two or three times without the buckle. Armors six, king table six.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm just looking at the tournaments that I'm seeing. I mean, I like the original super matches in PAL a lot of draws as well, but it's not like when they pull out the strap, you don't automatically pull two matches in the strap. Here's another interesting one for you, Todd. One more, just one more statement. I have yet to see any advantage in a tournament with the hustle strap.
SPEAKER_02: If the strap is not affecting the outcome in the hustle strap, then what we're arguing about with the fair strap is preferences, not distinction. Let me show you some distinct examples, okay? Because yes, I have not done the work that you have because I feel it's so obvious because I know it as an arm wrestler. I can feel it. I know it.
SPEAKER_02: but I'll give you some more anecdotal examples. Some very, very high level credible ones. Okay, this was the last time that the Mike Gould Classic happened. Okay, it was the last big one, Drake came up, Richard Lepkis pulled Mike Gould. There were a couple really high level matches at that event. A really good one that speaks to this exactly
SPEAKER_02: is Matt Mask versus John Brzenk. Do you remember that, Mask? I remember Mask versus John. Yeah, every time I saw that. That's right. And for some crazy reason, at that event, they used the hustle strap, which is completely crazy to me. Every time people use a hustle strap in a high-level event, I'm like, are you freaking insane? Me personally, I would lose my mind as an arm wrestler if somebody did that to me. But
SPEAKER_02: but uh yeah they did it at this match and it was so clear it's whoever had that because both those guys know how to pull in a strap you know in a hustle strap and they just murdered the other guy respectively both ways i i have a question when did we find out about this who found out that you know this is not a good idea the buckle side
SPEAKER_02: Well, I felt, so here's, here's what's up. So I thought it was just such common knowledge, like in Ontario, like, like, what's that? Everyone knows about this in Ontario. Everybody, everybody knows. And, uh, and, and it got to a point where I just started thinking about it and think about it. I'm thinking about the strap, thinking about the path. And I'm like, it's, well, it's not symmetrical. Why don't we start off with doing a symmetrical wrap?
SPEAKER_02: And I proposed it. I made a video about it. Like, geez, it must have been about 15 years ago now. And that year that I proposed it and put it out there that year, the WAF changed it. Right. So that year, the WAF switched from hustle to what we call the fair strap.
SPEAKER_02: and i don't know if i was the only one but i certainly made a video about it like 15 years ago and and john brzing thought when do you think that he started to think that you know that the battle side is well to me anybody who's a smart arm wrestler can figure that out i mean if you spend any amount of time in the strap
SPEAKER_02: pulling with a guy who's close to you that you can like beat them half the time maybe you will very quickly figure out that the buckle matters a ton in a hustle strap a ton like you will win every time if it's close between two people i'm telling you it's to me it's just it's so obvious like i can't believe we have the discussion but i will tell you something during my prime uh i top roll everyone yeah but that's because you're awesome
SPEAKER_01: Oh, no, no, no. Because because that is why I mean, like, we pull in our trainings here for many years, and men world champion was from here. And we all together train. And I don't know, we always do this. But we never we just say hello, how are you? But we never you, you could beat them all, right? I mean, I mean, the worst case, I would probably but they never toppled me. They never hooked me. I was, I mean,
SPEAKER_01: worst case you know just taking maybe i would lose if the guy is heavy or something but i mean i don't know i don't know so that that is why i didn't realize until but the question that when i'm asking that john bersink when did he realize todd you were answering sorry about it i believe john always believed i think he believes that to this day that the buckle side matters i mean
SPEAKER_02: teases me every once in a while when i say that the buckle doesn't matter i believed it up until a few years ago i just wanted i just set out to actually find proof of it um because you know there are certain things that have advantages incompetent you know casinos have an advantage in gambling there's an advantage to the white pieces in chess there's always lane choice and drag racing there's you know i was just trying to set out to prove it
SPEAKER_02: and I couldn't find any indication whatsoever that the buckle side mattered, which is what led me to start looking at the side of the table without the straps. And it's the same in the East versus West matches so far, the side where you're, if you're going to get the buckle, so if you're on the side looking away from the ref, that side loses more without the straps.
SPEAKER_02: And when you put the buckle on, it still loses more, but it loses less. If anything, the buckle averages out the table side a little bit. So there might be a disadvantage to which side of the table you're on. And we've just been attributing it to the buckle instead of to the fact that one arm wrestlers looking over a shoulder at the rep versus, or the refs like looking at your wrist a little bit more careful than the other.
SPEAKER_02: But we might have attributed all this stuff that's attributed to the strap and the buckle might very well be due to the fact that, you know, the ref is not looking at each arm wrestler the same. And TV's probably made it worse because now the down ref is like down and in the second row of the audience. They might not even be doing their job.
SPEAKER_02: i i agree with that i i would agree that even without the strap that's the better side i would agree with that because you get to see the ref and he has there's like a he doesn't see your wrist so he doesn't see your rest and you can and you're turned in anymore the guy the guy whose back is to the rest their shoulders are super square and the other guy is almost always crooked i i agree i agree but i i would still rather have a hustle strap
SPEAKER_02: well but there's a difference between preferences and advantages well i have that preference because i am so certain i'm so certain like i i think that if you looked at look i can think of matches from my own career like when i pulled marcio barbosa back in 2008 back when it was um this is back when it was hustle strap time um
SPEAKER_02: round one he beat me lefty and then after that i was able to turn it around the difference between the strap versus not strapped was massive john brzenk 2008 round one i had he had the buckle and i pounded him and then around yeah he was trying to topple around he tried to hook you that's the right well around it was not because of the bottom we switched side of the table i understand but he the first round when you flash him he tried to topple you
SPEAKER_04: He attacked your hand. Second time, he didn't attack your hand. He went inside. That's the difference, not the buckle. No, but also he had the good buckle on the second round. I think he could hook you anyways. Whatever. Hey, we have a couple of things. We have a super chat for $10 out there. Hey, Todd, if you were to have an engineer design a strap, which type of engineer would you hire?
SPEAKER_02: I was probably a material scientist or a mechanical engineer. Okay. And apparently Krasimir says that the new strap gives extra advantage to top rollers and it's bad for hookers. Devin, what do you say? I would disagree. I would say that it's symmetrical. I'd say that the new strap is symmetrical. And to me, it's just all about who can cheat better in the setup. Other than that,
SPEAKER_02: hookers top rollers i know that if i get an advantage in a strap i can hook better in it if i have an advantage in a strap i can top roll better in it if i have a disadvantage both those things fall out it doesn't to me it doesn't really matter hooking top rolling it's just your leverage points are better yeah the reason i asked about john when he realized that i i was thinking if it's psychological or not after some people says or he also really felt that
SPEAKER_01: Because he really, he really, and you too, you know, in Dubai, you guys were like, oh, you're going to have the buckle first. I'm going to have the buckle first. We know. How can you say that today it doesn't make so much, you know? No, I'm saying it does. It does make a difference. You said that now a little bit, but in the past it was like big. And I say it depends on the style. I think we all are disagreeing.
SPEAKER_02: so i don't think it matters about the style i think it used to matter like massively and now it still matters a bit yeah regardless of the style it doesn't matter to me if i'm hooking if i'm top rolling if the guy i'm facing is a hooker if he's a top roller to me it doesn't matter this side is better because i can cheat better in it the old system forget about it to me i can't believe people even talk about the hustle strap because to me it's like
SPEAKER_04: Take some time. Take some time and just go back and forth with somebody who's close. You'll see. It's so clear. Are there more Super Chats so we can continue? No, guys. More than two, I think I saw. There was a $4.99 Super Chat. Laugh listening into this legend and argue him too. There was a silly one earlier for $5 about John, but I'm not reading that.
SPEAKER_04: why was that it was a little silly one yeah you can read it if you want to and you know i don't know it's about like injections and stem cells it's nasty uh about john brzing to come to uh istanbul have the stem cell yeah i understand yeah and so far that's it be good there is um yeah no super chats you guys go ahead hey todd so i got a question for you so so based off of this information
SPEAKER_02: would you be comfortable to pull a guy like me who claims it's like everything like and give them that would you be willing to like just
SPEAKER_03: it was not this last east versus west but two east versus west ago me and engen were talking about this in the lobby and i said i should be able to sell my side of the table so if you and i were in a match then when it comes up to choose a side i said look you can have this side of the table support 15 percent of the purse or we would start we would start a negotiation but i would sell
SPEAKER_02: the buckle side i think that's brilliant i think that's a brilliant idea so you could sell you could sell either buckle side or you could sell the hustle strap if you felt really brave you could be like i'll sell you a hustle strap for this much man that's smart and what is that what's the organization rules are doing at this time
SPEAKER_02: We're just talking about potential week that I think that's a great, I think that should be common from now on. I think it should always be on the table. I feel like that should be on the table. Like people be like, okay, are we going to flip for it? I don't care. Oh, I don't care. Oh, I care a little bit. I'll buy it from you. I'll buy it for 20 bucks and be like, nah, nah, more than 20 be like, I'll buy it for you for 20 bucks and see, it's like a shotgun clause.
SPEAKER_01: Exactly. I like it. That would make things interesting. You can start bidding. You can probably get people in the audience to start bidding, and you could go fund me that. Man, I like that. That is great. That's a great idea. Only around that, yes. Only around that Matt beat Hermes in Yalova, East versus West one, was when the buckle was on Hermes' wrist. I'm telling you, it makes a difference. It does.
SPEAKER_02: like uh it absolutely does i can't believe that people don't to me it's just so obvious but you can keep that the problem is you can't prove it i can prove it but you feel it can you prove it yeah i can prove it i can prove it off of matches that i've had in the past but that's
SPEAKER_03: you might have a problem with the buckle. That doesn't mean the buckle's unfair. You just, you know, there might be something in the way you pull that disadvantages you. So it's one thing to say the buckle matters to Devin as opposed to saying the buckle matters to everybody. But Todd, even if it is the case, it is still, you know, it means something, you know. It means that in this type of style, it is disadvantage, even if it is the case.
SPEAKER_02: Well, if it's just one person, cause Devin arm, Russell's in several different styles. I mean, no matter what side of the table you're on, the buckle changes your style. So I used to, so back in the old system back when, so now it doesn't matter to me. I will arm wrestle the same, basically regardless of the side, because I don't think it makes as much of a difference.
SPEAKER_02: But back in the old system, depending on the side of the table I had, it would affect my plan on whether I was going to top roller hook. Or if I was going to try without straps. If I had the buckle, if I was on the side with the buckle, I would potentially attempt to hook or go inside much more often than I would the other way. Much more.
SPEAKER_01: I think i'm gonna i'm gonna make i'm gonna make the strap you know we talked buckle for the smart. No, no, but you said you said that it is lose it's gonna be but i'm going to make sure that it's going to be tight. that's smart. it's hard to tighten a velcro strap. But we need, but, but not only. I can make it, I can make it, I can produce it's not hard, you know. I think I think. it's hard to get tight.
SPEAKER_02: I agree with Todd. It's really hard to get it tight. That's one problem you're going to run into. I've pissed around with it a lot. To me, it was a fail. But if you can do it, that's great. Just make sure that it's symmetrical. It has to be perfectly symmetrical. What about the double buckle? Double buckle defeats the fairness issue. So double buckle is great.
SPEAKER_02: It's fantastic. I'm a big fan of the double buckle. The problem is now look at the only problem with a double buckle is the time it takes to set it up and the administrative cost and efficiency of making it and selling it. And it should it should be simple. I look at I like a double buckle when the WL was doing their thing and we were trying to advance it. I came up with a double buckle system as well.
SPEAKER_02: um but it it failed because it was a bit too complicated administratively to make it to carry it to uncoil it it just had it had other problems let me interject something here so let's say so we got two proposals we got a double buckle and a velcro strap right well there's another option how would you prove they're better than the current strap
SPEAKER_03: If it's just a survey of what people like, then they're going to have like a bunch of people that like it just because Devin voted for it. And a bunch of people, I'd have to go get like Brad Pitt and Kim Kardashian to advertise the other side. So you can't prove it makes a difference. How do you know you saw it? Yeah, yeah. But my friend, my friend, the one for sure has buckled at one side.
SPEAKER_01: The one that I am talking about, those that stitch apart will be from the equally from the both sides. And you are saying it will not be super, super tight. I don't think that strap should be super, super tight. I mean, as long as it does, I mean, it doesn't allow you to just get separated. It's holding you. I mean, it's normal that you can move with it.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, just like it has never meant to be. I mean, as long as the hands are holding each other, it doesn't get apart. I mean, of course, we're going to make it so tight, but it doesn't have to be really squeezing, squeezing, squeezing. People are going to slip out in that strapping, and I'd caution you early. I'd caution you early that there's a reason why that buckle is on there. There's a reason why we tighten those hands up so much. You get a flop. Do they get apart?
SPEAKER_02: listen you got ermys versus jerry i'll tell you in a in a in a in a in a velcro system it's not going to work i'll tell you right now yeah you have to duct tape those so much pressure and jerry's trying to come out the bottom and ermys will be coming over the top they're going to come apart in a in a velcro system you got to take you you got to tighten those guys up like crazy
SPEAKER_02: otherwise look at you it'll be like michael and jerry the thing is um look at yourself so todd like when it comes to uh like how do you prove and everything and look if there's a big study that you could do i i wouldn't have time for that myself what i would say is if if you want to just look very very simply you can say and i think we can all agree that the hustle strap
SPEAKER_02: was unsymmetrical because of the buckle and because of the wrap the fairer strap is unsymmetrical because of the buckle the goal should be symmetry if you have symmetry then there should be no advantage to one arm wrestler right
SPEAKER_02: I can't find an advantage today and I can find an advantage 20 years ago. So that's fine. You can't find an advantage. And there's people who are saying that there is an advantage. So let's just say that those advantages are found through a lack of symmetry. Nothing to oppose. If it is like symmetry,
SPEAKER_02: then there is, I mean, there is nothing to argue about it because it's symmetric. I mean, what would we lose? You understand? This is what you are saying. Exactly. So if we can create a system that is completely symmetrical, administratively easy and fast to apply, we're winning, right? So that would mean, look, and I don't, and that's the reason why I caution a double buckle because yes, it's symmetrical. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: but just the simplicity and the ease of administration hasn't been improved. I think that there's potentially a system that tightens from the bottom with loops that you just put your hand through, whether it's two loops or whether it's three loops, there's a looping system that has a single point attachment, tightens from the bottom, everybody gets pulled down. That's what I'm envisioning, but it has to be symmetrical. If it's not symmetrical, forget it, we're failing.
SPEAKER_01: if you ever make it unsymmetrical it's not a step forward you could just handcuff people together there's that you know what i will do i i will just just make nothing on it and i will use very strong glue between the strap every round i will cut it out you know and then use the new one just joking somebody said it in the chat super glue yeah you know
SPEAKER_02: um you know siamese twins are like melded we need to create a very like uh some kind of a a cream that we can rub our hands where automatically our skin just sticks right and like we become like become like siamese twins for a second that's an even worse idea than handcuffs
SPEAKER_02: uh devon uh 20 20 try super chat devon strap on tournament or not if it's up to you uh whatever like i i think it's fine i i don't have a problem with the strap only tournament um i think that it might even save time um
SPEAKER_02: i don't have a problem with it i just feel look it everybody knows my opinion on straps versus no straps i feel like if if someone wins when both guys don't have a strap on that somebody didn't try hard enough that's the way i see it i feel like oh or one guy's just way stronger you know oh bob brown just texted me bob brown just texted me and he said oh my god this is so easy to solve hey bob
SPEAKER_04: And I know what Bob's going to do. I'll tell you, he's probably just about to attack me. I've been attacking the chat by saying that all you have to do, I think, is to wrap the other guy first. If you simply wrap the other wrist first, you have symmetry. No, you do not, Bob. Bob, you do not. We already have symmetry. Bob. Wait, let me go. Before we go too far down the symmetry discussion,
SPEAKER_03: Once the hands are moved, the strap is doing nothing but applying compression. I am not on board that this symmetrical wrap thing has any effect or is even important. It's only important when you apply it. As soon as there's any movement, that strap's doing nothing but compressing the hands together. Hold on, hold on, hold on. That's not true. That's not true. That's absolutely true. It's true in the fair system.
SPEAKER_02: it's true in the fair systems no it's not it's true no it's not okay let me let me let me let me add to the debate here a little bit now imagine a system todd when we were strapped together where the only straps went from my wrist to your hand those are the only way we're tied together so you have so it's a loop around your wrist and it goes around my hand yeah
SPEAKER_02: okay so it's like half half the strap right okay how would that be well that would that would that would be an advantage to you because you're attached lower than i am right okay good okay so i'm saying then the old strap it's half of that the old strap that went around both our wrists and both yes however where's the lowest strap
SPEAKER_02: The lowest strap is the person has to be on low. The strap ends up right below your wrist bone. Yeah. Okay. So what's the lowest strap? What's the lowest strap there is on the hustle strap?
SPEAKER_02: You're saying, I mean, why don't you just tell me what you're getting at? But what I'm telling you is, is moving that strap, whatever that was from below the crossover to above it did not affect the leverage advantage. Once the hand- Devon, if I put the strap low enough with the buckle, that's the lowest strap. Even if you, if I have a buckle and I just apply it myself lower, that's where the lowest is. I'm not doing it.
SPEAKER_02: No. Yes, I'm doing it. If me and you are muscle, and I put your strap higher myself, as I've done to you in practice, I'll just lower mine. Mine is lower. Nope. Not in the hustle strap. Not in the hustle strap. Watch how practiced they do. Listen, listen. If I give you the buckle, you have the buckle. Just hear me out. If you have the buckle, you have the buckle. There we go.
SPEAKER_02: and you put that thing you can put that bottom strap down to your elbow i don't give a put it down at your elbow okay and then you go to me and you wrap that thing around my wrist okay okay and guess what then it comes back up and it goes to your you the buckle you look at that you tell me which is the lowest buckle which is the lowest strap what is the lowest strap
SPEAKER_04: well i still can readjust after though no it doesn't matter it doesn't matter that strap's gonna ride up to your wrist bone no matter where it's not gonna even bite because the lowest strap is the one that's gonna bite and that goes you know what i see what you're saying about biting yourself i think i i can agree with you there i think it will depends on the build of the person too like no it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it
SPEAKER_02: gonna be the same anytime the wrists come apart in the hustle strap system it's always going to be the bottom bite that's always going to be the bottom strap and it's always going to be an advantage it doesn't matter what the other guy does but imagine if the other guy cheats it how bad it gets you can't ever lose in a hustle strap if you've hustled strapped the person you cannot ever lose the the the battle of who's got the better strap you will never lose it stop yelling at your poor friends debbie
SPEAKER_02: happy all about this it's very important but the problem with all that supposition is the buckle side doesn't lose more in the hustle strap well i'll tell you that if you so i don't know what advantage it got but if it didn't help you your study is flawed i'm telling you it's flawed i know myself
SPEAKER_02: listen maybe some people just don't understand how to use it but once you do i'm telling you you will destroy people who don't have it and i'm fine look it i didn't i don't make this argument for myself as an athlete okay i make this for the community because i know okay listen me as an athlete please let me hustle strap you please let me let me do that and listen do you remember oh my god yes here's a great one for you
SPEAKER_02: todd do you remember when we pulled yes and do you remember that bart came up with that new strap i i mean i remember all that but i look i was never remember i cared i would have sold you the tables
SPEAKER_02: That's right. Do you remember that Bart came up with this new strap and all the athletes were like, yep, sounds good. Yep. Sounds good. Yep. Sounds good. And then I walk in and I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm like, okay. All right. You want to do that? Then I want this side of the table. Right. Because all he did was flip it. He did. He tried to make a new, new wrap and it changed. It still at the buckle side had the bottom strap. I don't know if you remember.
SPEAKER_02: And I was like, okay, that's fine. And I'm like, but listen, and I started to explain that all he did was reverse the side that he had not, in fact, made. And then we ended up going back to the old system. I don't know if you remember. I remember when we pulled and I remember the strap discussions. I never remember hearing. I just don't understand what, if there's, what kind of advantage does it result in more wins?
SPEAKER_02: Hold on, hold on, hold on. If you look at high-level arm wrestling, if you just look at top guys, guys who really know technique in close matches, matches where it was like 3-2, 4-3, 4-4, or not 4-4, but like...
SPEAKER_02: Look at those style of matches, high-level guys, super matches in the era of like 2008 and before. And I will be so shocked if there's not massive statistical evidence to back up what I'm saying. I'll be so shocked. There were a lot of super matches in 2000. Super matches didn't get popular until way after 2008. There still were some.
SPEAKER_02: And I'd only be interested, like the only statistical data that I would think would be valuable is in guys who were technically competent,
SPEAKER_02: and who were close like i don't like one guy like england was saying like he beat all his guys he's gonna beat all his guys regardless like if you put me up against some guy who i'm i'm better than i'll beat him all the time regardless it doesn't matter it's only when it's close wait come on man come on you are talking like i have been pulling at the local events here you know
SPEAKER_01: no i'm saying that i'm giving you world championships european championships against the kazakh russians guys and then you are saying like oh i mean regardless or something like it is not that i haven't been pulling in ontario i'm saying who beat you i'm saying find a guy that beat you during that era have a super match with him
SPEAKER_01: i know you won i'm saying like even but listen first of all you said one second first of all you said um okay talk i have to go okay just wait one second todd you said you said that the buckle side won more right at the east versus west and devon what was your argument to this
SPEAKER_01: i'm not arguing i'm saying that the the fair strap is much more fair the only argument you can make if you are saying that it's given more advantage to the non-buckle side the only argument may be a further further uh investigation to find out if it is styles up to styles but you say that doesn't make difference and right east first west the buckle one a little the buckle one last and the two other tournaments during the hustle strap era the buckle one more
SPEAKER_01: oh that's interesting even more yeah so you are saying that the all is maybe giving the advantage to the buckle side in the in the 1990s 2004 unified nationals the buckle one more than it than a box okay anyway so maybe but do you do like plan to is it possible to make a furniture
SPEAKER_02: you know, study about the style of the guys or something, or it's too difficult? Todd? Oh, I mean, anything's possible, but I mean, I didn't write down whether they were both top rolling or both hooking or something. I just took
SPEAKER_01: So you personally didn't feel this, right? You personally. Is it maybe you don't go in so much forward or back, but just going sideways? Do you think that's the reason that maybe Todd doesn't feel at all the difference? I don't want to have the buckle either. Don't get me wrong. I prefer to not have the buckle. I just don't think it matters whether you win or lose. Okay, okay. Then why wouldn't you want? There you go.
SPEAKER_02: And then why wouldn't you want if it doesn't make difference? You said you wouldn't want I want to face the ref. Oh, that's the only reason. That's the only reason. If I could face the ref and put the buckle on the other side, that would be fine with me. But I like facing the ref. I think that's a bigger difference. You got a hilarious proposal for you. Hey, what are you doing this weekend? Oh, we're doing inventory. I'm busy this weekend. What about Monday? Monday.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just working. You want to take a day off? Oh, I can't. Damn it. I'm going to the States. I leave the States. I go to Modesto, then John's Place, then LA. I would face you anytime. You could face the referee and I would have the hustle strap. Okay, I have a question. I have a question, Devin. Can you be taught
SPEAKER_01: at same weight without having the extra one two inches from the back side and without the shoulder going below easy day easy day
SPEAKER_02: Maybe. Well, I think you should put that. He's coming to East versus West anyways. You should set that up. Baba, does he want to pull against you or because you lost? I'm way too big and strong. Even when I'm little, I'm way too big and strong. With Todd, I just go like this. I go, boom, boom. Bring my shoulder forward, bam. I throw my bones into it. I test my frame. Todd wouldn't want to come in there with me. That's what happened last time?
SPEAKER_01: you gotta go okay so you would what you would accept him right if he challenges you again i told you i'd pull anybody you picked anyway okay okay i i would just call that one hey if you get free if you get free give me a call i'm gonna be in the states for the next week we can piss around with it
SPEAKER_02: You're going to be like 800 miles away from me. Yeah, yeah. I live on the other side of the country. All you need is somebody to pull with you a few times back and forth with this system, and you'd be like, okay, I see it now. Okay, 61% says disadvantage, 39% says not advantage, not disadvantage. Is that in the fare strap or in the hustle? The new one, the current strap. Yeah, there is a small advantage.
SPEAKER_01: 61% say it's a disadvantage. Okay, Todd, you take care of yourself. And Devin, just stay a little bit. Just stay a little bit. Bye, guys. Love you, Todd. Yeah. So, Devin, are you coming to East vs. West? I think that's the plan, isn't it? I mean, it's a plan between us, but would you like to say anything about it? Well, I'll tell you, the future is always uncertain.
SPEAKER_02: you never know what the future holds but if the right things happen 100 you will see me if the wrong listen listen what you think is the right thing right now may not be the right thing in actual it's true so so what what what what you think is it's just certainly a very easy easy match that
SPEAKER_02: here's for me there's a couple things that are going on um and when i think about my competitive arm wrestling uh i do not want to go after levon right yeah yeah not right now no no listen jody's like he's like never go yeah yeah she's she's right no need no need look at you look you look like 15 years younger
SPEAKER_02: so um so there's still there still are some super heavyweights that i'd like to pull there are but um but what i'd really like to try and do is i'd try and like to move into the divisions okay so there's a few divisions there's 115 there's 110 there's 105 and all of these i feel as though are in striking distance for me the first one is 115 and the 115 kilo when i think who is the best on the planet there's just a few names
SPEAKER_01: right now people think that it is like hands down prudently what with what is proven what's proven yeah and you would love to pull prudnik if he keeps holding the title is it correct 100
SPEAKER_02: Okay. What if Michael proves otherwise? Right. So and that's the thing. So if Michael beats him, look at Michael and I are for sure going to arm wrestle. It's inevitable. Michael, Michael is going to be 80 years old and I'm going to be 50 years old and I will probably still arm wrestle. Yeah. But I just know that for Michael and I, it's a whole lot easier. And I and I just pulled Michael just recently.
SPEAKER_02: Um, not to say I don't want to pull Michael cause if, if Michael really is the guy, then geez, I might, I might have to pull them, but I just know that we have arm wrestled recently and there's a lot of people that I haven't arm wrestled and I'd like to get to arm wrestle some more people. And if Prudnik wins to me, it's just very easy. It's very easy. That's the number one guy in the class. Oh my God. I would love a shot. I'd love a shot at the number one guy at one 15. Um,
SPEAKER_02: so if prudnik is that guy that's great but if it's michael if michael's the number one guy at 115 i don't know what i do do i do i there's something i have to make it depends because if michael beats prudnik for sure he will be proving something very important correct very important that's a huge match yeah yeah that match at 115 to me there's like a couple other names that are maybes like i think uh at 115
SPEAKER_01: I'd be interested to see what Sandra Sedis can do at 115. Can he beat Michael? I don't know. I will tell you something. For example, last WAF, Sandra took third place. Okay. Alexander Getalo beat him. Also, the Russian. Yeah, yeah. I mean, Sandra is incredible, but Sandra has not won any WAF title. And this year, he may.
SPEAKER_01: the Getalo is coming, but the Russians are not coming. Georgians are not coming. And it's in Russia because of the war, Georgia, because of the problems. So it still doesn't prove that, you know, but I would love to see, for example, with Getalo, Getalo beat Arif Ertem in a super match. Right. So that's, so that's what I'm talking about. So, so it's that, those kind of athletes that I'm looking at right now. How about Ungar? Do you know what happened? Only 10 days later,
SPEAKER_01: Ozan Kocak, Margarine, who beat Rewaz and John in Moldova, and he's a current world champion. And Ongarbaev, Krasimir, many guys, they are pulling, wow, 100 kilo. And your guy may be Ongarbaev. And also remember, just because you are, how to say, maybe just say Ongarbaev can be 100, 700, 800, 10 kilo.
SPEAKER_01: yeah and just because you are the title owner in the 105 kilo it doesn't mean that you are not going to pull in 115 kilo right so yeah like that's the thing right remember one thing when when putting the gang on that way when top roll versus top roll on that way was the one who took the risk you know he couldn't topple him so yeah that may be another match for you because for sure we'll be pulling in two categories by gaining weight
SPEAKER_02: yeah but you wouldn't want to maybe pull a match which is not for title and then you may try i would i would for sure i i'd like to get more active again uh like i i uh i had to give myself some time to uh to kind of figure out exactly where my arm is i'm happy i gave it a really good test i'm not worried anymore yeah i gave it a really good test
SPEAKER_02: um i feel like i still have a bit of work to do like i still am still filming i have a couple more seminars there's a few little bits and pieces but once that's done i will switch back to uh getting ready to compete again and yeah and that's gonna happen i'll probably start to switch sometime november december so that'll set me up for you know january february march getting back into the swing of competitive arm wrestling
SPEAKER_01: January, January. Maybe. Maybe. Yeah. I thought it was talks, but, you know. Yeah. It's looking very good to me. It's looking very good. I don't know. People who I talk with, you know, your training performance in Europe, especially after playing six, seven hours in Germany and then having some other very successful training sessions, you know, people are just, I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: There's a big difference between practice and competition. We all know that is a big difference. And what I'll say is that I am happy that my arm held together because what I put it through for those that 10 day or whatever I was gone between Germany and Paris, like the amount of volume that my arm with with withstood
SPEAKER_02: I'm very happy. I know I'm in a place now where I don't need to worry about the injury and I can start to take steps forward and compete again. So, yeah, we'll see. We'll see. I'll be in there shortly. Will you be surprised if Ongarwev loses at 12? I know that the world is a big place and there are killers. Ongarwev never had a ball title at 12.
SPEAKER_02: yeah that's what you're saying to me like i i no longer buy it i've actually i actually pulled on grabayev on a on a workout bench on a gym in malaysia like a couple days before he pulled kurdecha and he was super he was awesome like uh we pulled pretty hard uh two days before he pulled kurdecha yes i'm like yes
SPEAKER_02: yes i told him i'm like i'm like dude i'm like what are you like i'm like you're pulling in like two days like he didn't care he didn't care he just wanted to pull me so we did we i know he's i love the guy he's incredible yeah it was it was uh him and there was another guy from uh shot her there a littler guy really good hook cooler um tall or short
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We were all pulling all that whole time before he pulled Kardeccia. We were arm wrestling. Yeah. And I know he's good. I know he's incredible. So, yes, I would love to face him. There's a lot of matches that I haven't gotten to do. You know, I'm looking forward to having them. Yeah, yeah. We really hope and plan to have you here in January. Okay. Yeah, come on, come on.
SPEAKER_01: come on make your mind up we talked about it we talked about it we already have talked about it have you invited his wife yet of course of course listen listen i already invited you guys for november and previous 20 events you know every time i organize i tell him just come and then be our special guest always always of course judy what are you talking about
SPEAKER_01: She says she's just teasing you. She says she's just teasing you. Oh, okay. She's just teasing you. Anyway, so let's see. I will be bugging you, you know, right? Yeah, well, don't bug me too much, Ang, or else I'll end up top-rolling you. You're not going to top-roll me. No, that's right. I'm going to hook you. No, you cannot do it. I'm going to top-roll you.
SPEAKER_01: uh that's possible you may exhaust me and beat me like this but you know just open from bicep but doctor said that only 20 percent is that this long head of the bicep is holding the 80 percent is gone yeah he told me already yeah i'm good yeah but if you're going down there our match is going to happen you know right i know your fans will be uh laughing at me but uh
SPEAKER_01: yeah i i i love you know how how i was just playing with you after the my gold classic is a 70 kilo guy 154 guy and you show me how you do that and you show me how you do this hey arne you believe this guy man i i've seen that video man i i i could yeah i can see that happening i'm sorry no no i i don't know if it can happen but it happened in 2005 my gold classic
SPEAKER_01: And then he came to Istanbul to my guest, but I was totally injured. But he beat everyone there, including Krasimir. He didn't pull, but I couldn't do anything. I was injured, and he was much better. 2012, right? Early 2012. Yeah. 2012? I don't remember. It was great. Devin, you better be careful. Engine Don rolled his sleeve up. He's ready. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Anyways, so I hope everything will be okay, and I will be bugging you. You are not top-rolling me. If you go down to 105 to pull John or Ongar, babe, you're going to lose that extra five kilo, and we're going to keep our word. I will flag you. We will go directly referee's grip. Strap, yeah, as you want. Strap. Whatever. Doesn't matter. You pick the rule. You pick the contract. No, no, no. Not the rule. If we agree, we go strap.
SPEAKER_01: The referee's grip, you know, it's not that hard to go. And then close the hand. I will hit you sideways as hard as possible. You are not going to top roll this risk. Just look at it. It doesn't look like it's going to go back. John, be careful because you're going to start to say that I'm the greatest if you pull me. You don't want that. Nobody wants that. Why would I say that? I never thought that the guy I beat is greatest.
SPEAKER_01: you'll you'll start saying if we arm wrestle why some because you'll you'll have felt it and you'll know just just you will go down to 100 and i'm very fat 90 kilo and then i will go up to 100 kilo can you imagine me at 100 kilo i see this belly tiny that shoulder 50 something biceps and i have just stamped it wouldn't look anything like that again
SPEAKER_01: If you pull, you will be just, I will hide myself. When I do live on the internet, I will be doing like this, not showing anything, just my head like this, and then you will not realize what's happening. Angan, Angan, you don't want to go down this path this early. You don't want to start here. You don't want to start. We will, we will. Hey, listen.
SPEAKER_02: i gotta get out of here before this gets crazy just remember just remember that i'm i'm huge and i'll be huge when i'm 105 huge when i'm 110 it won't matter see that we agreed 100 100 and then you will see don't forget that again right there yeah it's all you need you will see you have been very you have been technically technically
SPEAKER_01: uh how say being in the guys that you are superior to them but whenever you meet something is just like much more coordinated and superior and smarter and then you will be like what's going on you know just like wow it's a mistake you know what i did you know hang in when you're ready just open up that pocketbook just open up that pocketbook so you can put you can put bacon in that pan right jody
SPEAKER_02: yeah but bacon in that pan for us hey i'll even buy my dog a new bone if if i get to pull you what does it mean a new bone yeah i mean what is i know i know but what does it have to do with our match oh i'll be rich afterwards because you'll pay yeah you know just just just just watch your mouth don't involve country
SPEAKER_01: don't involve anything family or anything, then do whatever you say. I will just not listen to you because you will give me a headache, you know? No country, no family. And not hurting the honor type of thing, but you can say, Engin, you are scared of me, but you don't call me something bad, but you can say that I'm going to crush your arm. I'm going to broke your arm. Like you can say, Engin, oh, tomorrow,
SPEAKER_01: at 2 a.m in the morning i will be smelling the the salt of your tears you know i i can't believe that you were having the biggest match of your life and the last word of you was me how i lived rent free in your head at the moment i was just do you remember when you arm wrestled john brzenk and he destroyed you yeah you mean you mean i had a torn bicep and the the like he like made it just look silly i just i just that's enough
SPEAKER_01: right and you know that like just a couple days before that i just totally destroyed john right yeah yeah yeah yeah but just remember one thing i had call it five training five trainings called no no i really was dying everyone sold for him yeah and i had torn bicep i was like you know fat fat 90 kilo john was 109 kilo understand and we
SPEAKER_01: yeah okay whatever you will be going 100 i will go 100 good training no injury are you serious right now again what do you mean you really want me to destroy you is that really what you want you can i will flash you and you're gonna have that low hand top row right above your thumb you know right above your tongue wow you can't actually be serious right i'm very serious
SPEAKER_02: like it's cool and all like i know it's but but really like do you really want to arm wrestle me if i am ready i am like more than ready to just hit your side i will tell you something very honestly okay okay be very honest with you okay i really like you engen but it doesn't it's not going to change i really like you i really like you
SPEAKER_02: this is the strategy right that you to make me like so i'm just telling you yeah okay i really like you okay i really like john brzenk but i destroyed him he destroyed you too he has in the past and i'm telling you i mean if you really want to face me if you really really want to face me i'll put it on the shelf for a bit and i will
SPEAKER_02: destroy you people in the chat saying sign that contract but listen hanging it's silly seriously that the problem is the problem is is nobody actually thinks that you could beat me that's the problem that's good so what does it mean i mean what does it change well it just it just means that you know like nobody would bet on you it's okay it's just the people who bet on me will make the most money probably that way nobody would that's the problem
SPEAKER_02: let's see i mean the people who support me they don't gamble that that okay listen let's listen say that can you make a poll nah like say that there was no ethical and it was just you and you had a thousand dollars and that's all you had left and we met at a hundred kilo
SPEAKER_01: Would you really put that thousand dollars? My friend, I don't really know that I even ask you to not to put my matches on the staking because I don't want to be part of the gambling. You're asking me to bet now. I mean, I only know one thing that, you know, I would really like you go down to the weight. I go after that weight and then there will be a hard time for you. Now, you know a lot about arm wrestling. So what percentage would you give yourself?
SPEAKER_01: Just like, I will tell you something for sure with the goal, whenever I hit you, you either will end up on the path or just want something about or something, but I think I will, I will flash ping you. Okay. Oh my God. Oh, okay. Oh yeah. Hold on. Hold on. I can, I can hear all the laughter. Everybody's laughing right now. It's okay. It's okay. I mean, they are laughing at someone. They are laughing at someone that.
SPEAKER_02: probably has done things more than 99 for that's why look at i agree engen you're incredible but if you were to face me at 100 kilo you would call me the greatest you'd just be like oh my god devin oh my god why thinking i would destroy you i would destroy you
SPEAKER_01: You are not going to destroy me. You will end up like this somewhere. I don't know if it is going to be just boom or just like one something and come back and hit and pin or I don't know. We will see. Yeah, okay. I will be honest with you. To do that three times, maybe probably. I was about to interrupt you guys. The first time, I think it's possible. I think Angin is the flash. What about the second round? What about the second round and the third? Yeah, it depends how quick the first round is.
SPEAKER_01: guys just seriously seriously seriously like i can't believe we're even discussing this this is even more absurd than talking about the hustle strap i will tell you something when i pull the the john like trust me i really was really cold just i was dying you know and i had only five trainings and the bicep was still injured but i promised the guy so i pulled it but john especially on the second round he said he i
SPEAKER_01: separated good right i i talked to him you almost had me engen was there raymond was there he said that whenever he i hit him um also we did a training later i didn't join but he said that whenever i hit him the role he was a part of his he thought that the next i was gonna flash him but he said i didn't have the side pressure to do that and he said whenever he pinned me he said it was the 95
SPEAKER_01: his max afforded he pinned me but that trust no no i talked with him you know whatever whatever i know what i felt and then when i made the mistake in the second round he was my max my friend nyazi told me to roll and then whenever i wrote i was vulnerable to do the side pressure but till that moment like i was more moving that way trust me that the match was stuck there
SPEAKER_01: then whenever i wrote just if you would know turkish you would hear from the video and then he slowly pressed me but he didn't have the wrist but this is probably i will be 30 stronger than how i was there and i believe that john at same weight would beat you no yeah you super heavyweight john john heavyweight you beat john now listen john was like 250 when he pulled me
SPEAKER_02: yeah but he was just like bloated you know yeah yeah look at so so what is it guys i mean are we signing this contract for main entertainment card match east versus west to me it's just here's here's what i know will happen okay the first thing i know is that engen needs to really think about this
SPEAKER_01: because i think deep down he knows that it's mission i have no doubt as devon and can roll two sleeves up listen i had just stem cell probably i can say that biggest reason is you you're gonna need to have five more sessions no no i don't know we will see today i started training he also did not to the joint but also to the lateral here even with the empty bar it hurt me
SPEAKER_01: If this goes well, listen, I really want to pull, you know. But if this goes well, if I'm in good shape, I will pull you. Oh, sure. But if the elbow joint doesn't handle, I mean, I can't. Because my chance, I cannot go into with you endurance game. We both know that. I really need to just take you and hit the pad, you know. That's all I can do. But if I am hurt, it doesn't help. Because right now, I can't even press as much as my junior students.
SPEAKER_02: But if I can press, yeah, sideways without pain, you know, those cartilage grows here, I mean, I will pull you. I promise. Okay, so that's the first thing. What? The second thing is that once we were to sign a contract, before we had the match, you would probably end up in an insane asylum. I will what?
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah you would probably end up in an insane asylum you'd go crazy you will be in the place with crazy people that's what he said oh you're gonna you're gonna provocate me no you'd provocate yourself you just spin out into you just completely no no no no no i mean i have handled i have handled
SPEAKER_01: Just imagine how much pressure during my career. It's not going to. But if you go too disrespectful, then let's not go there because it's going to affect our friendship. We don't want that. A question. How many people are on the Arm Wrestling Engin Facebook page right now? 752 people watching us live. No, no, no. But how many people are on the Engin? 18,000. How many? 18,000. 18,000? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I bet by the time that match happened, it would be down to about 10,000 and you'd blocked probably 8,000 accounts. Oh, it's time to end this voice. Why? What do you mean? It's time to end it. Like I have to go. I gotta go. Hey, I will destroy you. I'll destroy you.
SPEAKER_02: The time has been coming for a while. You know, it's inevitable. It's inevitable. Jason Statham is here. Yeah, we're going to pull. It's only a matter of timing. And I get skinny enough and you think you can get me. I will crush you. Also, also, also, also the people in the chat that are saying. But Engen, it'll hurt you very badly. I have done things during my career that
SPEAKER_02: couldn't even do one percent of it oh stop you don't even understand the hustle strap you don't even understand the hustle strap i need you to do something around here get off again okay be careful be careful okay bye bye bye bye it'll be very bad for you again very very bad no i'm sorry listen i just
SPEAKER_02: We're still friends, Engen. We're still friends. Yeah, we will stay friends. Be very careful, Engen. Be very careful. I got to go. I love you guys. Yeah, just...
SPEAKER_04: boss yeah we have a 50 uh we have 50 turkish dollars man i love that one against engine at 100 kilos but i will be challenging for both athletes can't say who will win it looks like a 50 50 chance yeah but you you are right you are right you know just just just trust me one thing uh my friend artem i would i would um
SPEAKER_01: no i don't need to chill with the curse but i can send you uh away from this channel so you can shut the up yeah see um that's easy uh hey well while you read guys since i got the times to talk uh um
SPEAKER_04: we do have east versus west youtube channel so and i'll be throwing the links make sure to comment subscribe to that because we need a thousand subscribers before next east versus west hopefully so make sure you click and subscribe and you know it will be a lot better for all of us comes next next event yeah i mean just i will tell you something i will tell you yes uh
SPEAKER_01: But I believe if that match happens, we hold, the strap is tight, and if he would be dominant right away, right from the start, you understand? I will be very surprised. For sure that I will be hitting him so hard, he won't be taking my wrist or anything. He will be coming somewhere, either we go to the pad or he will just stop somewhere. I'm not talking about
SPEAKER_04: best of them. Many people here are the, okay, one guy, another guy. Well, and in my question, because I've pulled them in a bunch of the practices, right? So do you really want to like, you know, I'm entertaining the idea. Well, do you really want to hit him?
SPEAKER_01: why why of course i mean you you cannot listen any second i've seen him i've seen him in practice whenever he goes that's usually when he breaks apart that's why i didn't know listen listen every every every uh match um that is like active every second you understand he is like a vampire he will be sucking your blood
SPEAKER_01: And my, my, my police style, I am, I don't know if you have seen when I'm healthy, how I can eat. I can hit so terribly, you know, just to the director to the pets, you understand right from the start, without positioning without positioning this, I can go right right to the if elbow is healthy, right now elbow is not healthy. That's why I can hit with the elbow, I need to pronate and risk or, and then
SPEAKER_01: after I unlock the guy and then I ping. But if I am healthy, I can really hit sideways so strong. And I wouldn't want to pull him like referee puts strap, we close the hand, close referee's grip, and then I would probably put pressure right two seconds before the goal and then right to the pad. You know, I would try to go. That is what I wanted to go.
SPEAKER_01: more you stay active with him more you know you will go down and i understand he will go up so you wouldn't i'm not underestimating him if he's just 120 kilo 113 kilo 30 kilo even 110 kilo i wouldn't put him i'm talking about a wild devil you understand w.a.l when i'm talking about and i'm not talking about any kind of earlier shape of mind you understand
SPEAKER_01: I'm talking about 100, maybe even 105 kilo and making 100 and again reaching 105 kilo. I wouldn't pull with him.
SPEAKER_04: within the condition that I am. But all you're saying that you genuinely believe that he's in that 225 pounds to, you know, whatever. 100 kilos to 20 pounds until, you know, what's the limit, I think? 240? 110? Where's your cap? Where do you think it's capping for Devin? What's that? What's the weight limit? So you want him at 220 or what's the heaviest can it go?
SPEAKER_01: You mean Devon after the weigh-in? Yep, yep, Devon. No, no, not the weigh-in. Where are you comfortable? Where are you comfortable in Devon if he is between what weight? 220 and 240? So like 100 kilos, 105? I mean, we agreed 100 kilo limit. We agreed that. Anything below that would be unfair to him. Anything above that would be unfair to me because the WAF, I never competed above 75 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: right even if you see me 100 kilo you will see me with minimum 10 kilo fat still yeah i am now about 90 kilos still like if i would be ripped right now i wouldn't be even weighing 80 kilos so anything what what's your weight right now because people in comments have have important thing is it healthy for you to to try to bulk all the way to your 100 kilos is this healthy
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. Probably it's not. Well, it's not because you know. Okay. Yeah, I mean, but whenever he comes here and then he provocates me like, you know, just like, I'm going to do this and I'm going to do. The only problem with me is here, you know, the car has, you know, reverse shift as well, right? I don't have that one. That's the problem. I never had like that, that, that.
SPEAKER_01: Sorry about it. That reverse shift, I never had it. So that is why, I mean, if I'm healthy, I will go for it, you know? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: be careful just be careful i see what you're saying yeah pulling devon here what i was trying to say my friend this guy is not 100 you know what you know what but i think what i'm referring to you're right just attacking him as he sucks you in it's a bad idea i think what i'm referring to i know if you notice that if on practices if you tell devon to go
SPEAKER_04: when he goes on his own that's where he actually that's where he breaks apart a little bit well he just waiting for you to make a mistake for the position yeah it just you're gonna be done and that's it but if you're like well no no no you go let me hold you that's where devon's wrist can fall apart a little bit you know my friend i i cannot i cannot depend on where he is yeah you cannot tell ship that yeah i need to depend on what i am doing at best you know you understand
SPEAKER_01: With my right wrist, my right wrist is flexor to the end here to lock here is not super good. But the wrist to handle at the beginning position, even I hold like this, you pull with two hands I press. I mean, this wrist is not this is handling you understand whenever I press the wrist is not going back at this start is
SPEAKER_01: really solid wrist to not to be bent so more i put pressure more evil handle you understand but i need to be here strong and then so that i can put this strong wrist behind so much pressure you understand but if the elbow is hurting your wrist being solid doesn't matter there needs to be a force behind so that i'm not going to try to control his tornado with my wrist i'm going to try to control his tornado
SPEAKER_01: with the pressure and then handling. More I will, like some people goes, goes, goes, the risk goes back. You understand that? Yeah, that's normal what happens, yeah, against him. Yeah, that is not the, I don't know. And people are- I mean, you are correct. That's exactly what happens. You go sideways with the schema normally, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why I'm saying. And then some people, when they go sideways,
SPEAKER_01: Because they want to press more here, they are losing their pronator. I have never used my pronator in an active way. I don't try to totally pronate out. My pronator actually is, whenever the pressure is coming, it is getting even more effect. I know I think me and you disagree. I know you like that static pronation, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just people, like I hold people, they don't feel any active power on my pronation. But they try to beat me, the risk goes like this.
SPEAKER_01: I don't really apply so much. I just stay like this solid. That's enough. The pronator is more blocked. So many people, either they need to pronate or go side pressure. When they go side, they may lose their pronator. With me, my side pressure and the pronator and the wrist handling is all working together. So there is a possibility that I would try to keep his wrist at the neutral position.
SPEAKER_01: and attack on his pronator at the same time. You understand? Sideway, over. And then it can handle. I'm again saying 110 kilo, 115, 120. No, I'm not talking about that. But just people need to understand that 100 kilo Devon is not Superman. I may not beat him. I think there's possibility at the end, most likely he will end up winning 3-1, 3-2. This is what I'm just saying. But that first couple of rounds or something, you know,
SPEAKER_01: If people are thinking that he's just going to hold me like this and look at my face, then they are the ones who are delusional. I'm talking about the right from the start, you understand, to do directly going to the pet.
SPEAKER_04: mean so what's your how do you do so what you're saying don't understand it you're saying your your style because i'm trying to see how you're going to defeat that if he potentially stops that the depredation you're saying your specific style is actually perfect to go there and not get your hand open
SPEAKER_01: yeah so what you say like how are you going to not get i think that if i would try to totally top roll him it's no good for me i will be missing i will be missing his pronator if i totally try to control that maybe i may be having problem with my own pronator so that the thing is just to keep
SPEAKER_01: both of them at the natural position and then almost like justin bishop very natural you know have control all around but not to over rotate anything just go ahead i mean just just i i need to attack on his pronator i really need to hit like this but i know it is not going to be like this but we'll stay most likely uh flat you are correct yes because that's what just just watch just watch the
SPEAKER_01: uh second match with arthur macaro okay you know i've seen those yeah but on the second round when i win i tear the bicep and and even including in the match he got there but just watched around one and round two um and then watch alan zole versus arthur macaro
SPEAKER_01: At the WAF, when Arthur was doing like this, when Alain Zoller was going, his wrist was like going, but with me, it wasn't the case. Arthur, even in the strap, just look at that. I can show you the picture. In the step, you don't see like this, but even in the second round, his fingers went into his own hand because of my pronator. I will show you the picture. It may slide down, but it doesn't happen like this.
SPEAKER_01: The reason that I tear my bicep during that match, because I saw the second match, he was closer. So I put my feet to the right corner of the leg and I pull him so hard that his fingers went sliding on his hand. But the problem is after I took his wrist, whenever I pull more, you know, wrist came, only the strap is holding. So more you pull,
SPEAKER_01: You are not actually putting pressure to his shin, but you are trying to pull his lat from the pad. You understand? There is no bicep which is stronger than the lat, especially Arthur's lat. You understand? And the more I pull, so that is where the bicep went. You understand? And then I came closer and I won. But just look at those matches. My wrist didn't go back.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, matches. Yeah. But look at Alain, Alain Zola beating it off. Just watch three matches took more than two minutes. But round one and round two me are against Arthur took nine seconds. First round four seconds in the second round five seconds and trust me, Arthur here is brachioradialis very, very strong guy. So I'm not saying that Arthur comparable that but I will not be that that way either. I will be 100 kilos. So if people are thinking that
SPEAKER_01: Those guys in super heavyweights and heavyweights, pound for pound, they are much superior to those lighter guys. They are mistaken.
SPEAKER_04: They understand what I'm going, those guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. You take, you take an elite in shape, you know, those WF champion guys and you put them against, you know, or not, not in shape of whatever regular day, heavy day. Yeah. You will see some weird upsets and you know, some, something you're not going to like for sure. Yeah. So what I just tried to say that Devon hundred kilo, I don't think it's his comfortable zone and hundred kilo for me is not my category.
SPEAKER_01: So it would be probably fair, it would be fair if I can be in a, like, for example, I will tell you, Devon had the stem cell and then I saw him five days, six days later, he was at the table and pulling nonstop. I had stem cell and nine days, now I did the hammer curl with the empty bar, it was still killing me from the lateral epicondylates. So I really do not know my condition, but if I'm good, people knows me.
SPEAKER_01: yeah how do you how do you like that because i was offered sorry i was offered by my sponsor the stem cell treatment how you like that do you yes no is it i mean no no it's just only nine days he said it will be the effects will be seen after four months oh okay okay gotcha yeah after after four months you know so but this is only nine days he said that after 10 days do with 30 percent
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, 30%. So we will see. We will see. I mean, if I am just believing one thing, if I'm ready, if I'm ready, I can pull anyone at my weight. If I'm ready, I can pull. See, I pulled Viorel Dobrin. Did you see that match? Yes. I beat him 5-0. Except one round that I over-pronated. All of them were easy, just flash pins. In the same year,
SPEAKER_01: We ran WM on 85 kilo volts. He is the current version, but in 85 kilo. He beat, who did he beat in the final? He beat Tautiev. Yeah, in the final, he beat Tautiev. He toppled Tautiev. And every round I toppled. Easily took his wrist, you know, and beat him flash pit. See, many people, if you are an outside puller, and when you go sideway with Vioran, you are losing your wrist. I mean, you need to go a little bit inner side way.
SPEAKER_01: with him. Every round, when our wrists were just matching each other, his wrist was going back. You understand? You don't see that. Like Mindagas, we pull, every time I pull, his wrist goes back, you know? So what I just said, I have good wrist handling. Right, you have a better hand control, yes. Yeah, but the only problem is how much joint will be healthier and how much pressure I can add behind so that I can hit, you know? That's what it is, you know, just
SPEAKER_01: nothing else so anyways my friends it is long time you know yes sir and then so anyways so let's let's we can finish uh but a lot of people have no idea a lot of people have no idea about what they are talking um again last time i'm saying i'm not talking about
SPEAKER_01: the Devon that they saw against Levan or Michael or John or something. I'm talking about wild Devon. And do you think that, I will tell you something, Artem, do you think that 100 kilo Devon, for sure the best in the world in 100 kilo?
SPEAKER_04: no so for that to be said one that one gets to the 225 i mean no like one last time when he was that weight he was losing to john right that's what happened last way to 25. i think in my opinion yeah he there's like 20 more people there are 20 more people that he needs to beat and he's like all right he's in the top 10 top five and whatever you cannot you cannot say 100 percent no not at all not at all he has too many dudes
SPEAKER_04: yeah you have too many dudes that still look normal that still can do that like as i said hunger by f probably get tallow is like also looks healthy there's a lot of people that steal in that tolling lanky 220 you know pounds if i say that i can pull this guy why is it not like super super super surprising for people that whenever you said devil is because he's so famous
SPEAKER_04: Well, I guess it's two things. I don't know, to be fair, obviously it's fame, right? Second thing, probably the initial weight difference, right? Because as you said, you're pulling Arturo and all those mainly middleweight, lightweight guys, right? And Devin is like in an outer frame. It really depends how far does he really sit in that 100 kilo? Is he like really the top five guy and he's really like in that top 20 guy?
SPEAKER_04: i guess how good he really is over there it all depends so i don't yeah i mean i agree with you it's not too too crazy but i think people disagree with you for this thing obviously he's famous second that he uh just went after levon so he's bigger and i think that i'm saying that you know we're not talking about that devil right we are not right right right yeah i understand yes we're talking about 100 yeah yeah
SPEAKER_04: yeah i guess i guess people i i guess people will well in devon's point good too you know i mean because technically you know yeah even though you know you were in a bad shape pulling john but like even if you want to come back to that he was being john land but yes the weight is not the weight is not the same still right so i guess people people can refer to that
SPEAKER_01: as devin was referring to that right there's obviously a lot more circumstances is it you were saying like you had covet you know all that was happening listen in june 2021 i tore my bicep and then many months later i started with one kilo two kilo and then i thought i would come in a good shape and by the time of new year i was in a like very hopeful shape that i had two and a half months more and i was like yeah i will be good and then i went to do
SPEAKER_01: uh seychelles island with arif and then i got covid and i come back there i thought i was dying you know yeah and then from from new year till the the john match i only had five matches which was a five uh not match five trainings and which was like when i had just covid i get out of covid you understand and just i don't know
SPEAKER_01: john john john even made it people say people doesn't know people just wants to believe what they want to believe you understand they don't believe what's the fact when john said that he at the i know what john felt i know john himself felt and he told his front of many people as well you know and and he even next day or a few days later he made he said that you know english grenade that is probably better than crazy george bernard and we all know that the guy has incredible grenades so
SPEAKER_01: the the only only difference is that you know i can tell you maybe i should pull john first at 100 kilo and then then we can see that we can see the difference and then maybe then maybe we can um we can understand if i would be but can you for sure say that 100 kilo devon would be 100 kilo john for sure like he asked devon asked to uh
SPEAKER_04: raimon's raimon said john would beat him hey i mean some might say right now but last time it happened john won and not only john won last time like all the years ago john also won technically coming back he was not acting he was not part of wl he was you know he came back that year and beat devon and you know if you were our master back in those days
SPEAKER_04: you know the feeling was not there you cannot you know people know john is the goat but you cannot think it can happen so with me seeing that years ago yeah i can't i can't tell you who beat who john or devon for example right now david is gonna pull prudnik and then when he's gonna put pruning at 115 kilo uh and then maybe on garbaev if he comes close to 105
SPEAKER_04: then if i get healthier and ready good shape i think i'm not going to start right away with devon i would like to yeah i would like to see prudnik and devon for sure because i will because devon been pulling levon who's like you know well if you can't beat him it doesn't really tell you much because he's the number one guy but if devon beats prudnik it actually will tell a lot about devon's level uh around everybody right because yeah actually too much more you lose weight
SPEAKER_01: if you are near two meters and more you lose weight, more it is your comfortable auto, comfortable zone. The only problem with those guys that the height remains the same. Their forearm is still long. It's still hard to deal with. Yeah, long, but you know, there needs to be some muscles, strength, horsepower, sports, you know. Yeah, yeah. And sometimes, you know, when you have long arm, especially with the Wafruz, referee is going to pull your elbow back to get the center.
SPEAKER_01: understand and your arm will not look anymore like this but your arm will like look like this ah so you're saying another thing you also get in a better position for the top pearl huh because we are going to be at the center you know okay i'm going to stay like this you know he's gonna the referee is gonna make him go back and then he will give me more you know you know what i mean especially in this let's see let's see how it will be you know
SPEAKER_01: But people, people are just so much intimidated by the fame. I know he is very strong, but it's not Superman, not Superman. Yeah. As Devon said, you cannot read comments. If you have the match does happen. Yeah. You cannot pay attention to people. Anyway. So thank you very much for joining exactly two hours and hope to see you.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, sir. I'll see you. I'll see you like four or five weeks. Five weeks. Yeah, five weeks in Istanbul. You take care of yourself.
SPEAKER_04: yes sir yes sir before we go guys there's still 455 of you we have east versus west instagram we have east versus west uh ebay uh ebay youtube account feel free to sign up uh and subscribe because we need all those people to get east versus wet a lot bigger by the next one the next one and we don't want it to stop so please make sure go like and subscribe engines page go click on the all the new youtube links that i guess throughout and uh
SPEAKER_01: yes and you guys will see anger next time i read these comments that you know these people doesn't know i think you and i we get upset with each other too because when i said that i flashed travis badge and i was only 70 kilo
SPEAKER_04: i in the same no no no no no no no no no you did not read my comment back then
SPEAKER_01: i'm willing to lose my job not to give it i never said that all i ask you is their video so i can find it because i can find it no no you don't remember your comments you blocked me you blocked me after that listen your comment was how can you be travis you are not even at same weight
SPEAKER_04: this this I remember like yesterday right and right right right you know why I said that see you didn't read it right you're gonna read it right that's why you have problems if you message me hey Artem what do you mean I said engine I mean that you and Travis are not in the same weight class so there's no way you will pull each other so you will have to tell me why would it be in the same weight so yeah you have to tell me you have to explain it to me hey Artem
SPEAKER_04: you were just meaning like you know you're lying no no no i know what i meant i know i know i got upset with you because oh my god this guy can't even listen and i was trying to be nice i was not trying to upset you and then after that day i'm like oh yeah i will never want to deal with engine because i was trying to be nice i was trying to make sure i will find the correct information you were being sarcastic you were being sarcastic
SPEAKER_04: I know I was so glad you unblocked me. I'm in this group. You messaged me. I'm like, yo, Engin, how does it happen? What the circumstance? Let me find this. No, no, no. Oh, you're making fun of me. I blocked you. Why would you even question such thing? If I said I beat him, I beat him. Some people come to the right. I get a question if you beat me. I get a question if you beat me.
SPEAKER_01: listen some people say that oh and in practice pool doesn't count who the said that you know it was a practice pool you know it was just like i beat guys like michael thought i'd be i i was 70 kilo ron was 110 kilo because there was no 100 kilo category i gave him a hell you know my tongue was get dislocated like you still have you still owe me explanation how do you and travis pull each other i mean i i won the my category he easily beat john he beat easily
SPEAKER_01: all those guys in supers and then he had like maybe 20 seconds match with dan victor but it was just an hour before we pulled and i just flashed him you know just like nothing how did you pull you pulled his class or it was overalls no no overall overall but the only match you had to tell me that couple months ago and you will never block me it was not a couple months ago it was two years ago
SPEAKER_04: Well, no, you blocked me first time years ago. I don't know why. I think I was young. I don't know why, because you blocked me like very, like when I just started arm wrestling. I don't know, you know, I was, I probably said something else. Probably you were being a smart ass again, you know.
SPEAKER_04: No, I understand. I started messing young and arrogant at 18. Everybody hates me. How old are you? I'm 27 now. Oh, you're very young. Oh, you're talking about maybe like eight years ago, seven years ago. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: because you blocked me the first time and i don't know why you know i mean that the second time that what we're talking about i understand that was this you just misunderstood me i just legitimately wanted to ask you how did that happen so i can find it because you know i can go i can go to places people cannot go i can go to like vk i can find stuff i was so trying to find you that video and you're like no no no you're making fun of me i blocked you
SPEAKER_01: I'm like, okay. Because I felt like, you know, I wrote all those names that I beat, Rustam, Babaev, Zole, Awaji, Murad, all those world champions. And then you are like, you know, how can you beat Travis? You know, you are not even same class. Yeah, you guys, I get that. I get that mental like that. I really, I just meant how did the weight class, that was my only question so I can find it. I get that mental because respect you. I'm glad we're talking about this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's okay. It's okay. Yeah. Probably I misunderstood you, but it's okay, you know.
SPEAKER_04: that's all this i was legitimately i understand like 10 years ago you probably blocked me for me being a young like i'm i've been doing that for like the second one second probably i probably had
SPEAKER_04: some memory from 10 years ago right right right i mean i understand like there's so many well i think me and you had like the longest like thing where you blocked me but i think it was just a misunderstanding i really like never had like i've always liked you right but then like if i pull if i start pulling you know after this if i start getting better who do you think i should i'm not gonna start with devon but who do you think i should start uh what's your what's your weight
SPEAKER_01: mean probably i will be around 187 85 kilo or something okay i'm so fat i i hardly breathe you know just like i mean just like i really need to move but i can't even go training because of this east versus west i'm all time calculating making calls and this i know i'm communicating with five people at the same time you know their answer their answer all day you know athletes and you know social media and
SPEAKER_04: yeah i'm on the phone with you my wife is asking me questions i'm like oh no i need when you message me if i'm going to be live i'm like i can join but i was doing my side pressure workout i'm like well i'm just warming up i can come back and i can redo the workouts so let me do this i understand you busy uh but you will want to pull is that going to be part of east versus west so you get the western person or you want to do something around there i would like to pull i would like to pull you know i'm at
SPEAKER_01: end of my career you understand oh you know what you've been you're gonna like me for so many years you pull me i i really want to pull someone you man you can pull left-handed because they'll probably beat your left hand it can motivate me i have pulled a lot in the past so now i would like to choose opponent and i would like to do something that i couldn't do before you understand i would like to pull i know you are a very good puller
SPEAKER_01: but it is not really like beating Artem Taranenko. If I would write like my CV from the past, you understand, I wouldn't just say like Rustam Babayev, Hacim Radzolev, Travis Bergin, Artem Taranenko, I wouldn't even mention you there. Sorry, I know you're getting angry with me, but you need to put a little bit more. It's all good. You give me a couple of moments. Give me a couple of moments. It's all good.
SPEAKER_01: i'm not saying i'm not saying that i can beat you i know i know you can't because i know i see you lose to valentine at worlds and i beat valentine that's all good yeah see the one guy right engine alan zoleo these guys all are pulling 70 75 kilo i'm not i was about to say alan but i don't know if you want to do the the russian guy right if it's uh if love allows me i i'm going to do what championships
SPEAKER_01: This is Saturday, and then I will talk with the WAF officials and I will just say, you know, if they allow or not allow, because, you know, they have power to stop even this event, you know, because through the Turkish Federation, you know, over here, you can't organize an event without the permission of the Turkish Federation. It's all under government control. Yes, I don't know if this is the right thing, you know, just like Engin, don't pull while organizing. Trust me, I will tell you something.
SPEAKER_01: The only thing, especially the last weeks, is just getting incredible. Especially last few days, I have like three hours sleep, four hours sleep, you understand? And so I'm getting exhausted. Just say that Tuesday before the East versus West, I'm 100% ready. Trust me, by this Saturday, I will be 70% or 80% maximum because it's so exhausting, you understand? To meet people, take them there, organize this, organize that, you know?
SPEAKER_04: lot of things especially the yeah that's another thing yeah i don't know yeah i don't know if you want to do all of that yeah all the smashes because you are part of it it's almost like you have to set something for a separate event that's not that's not your event that maybe you're going somewhere right because yes yes the people that's a correct thing because you do a lot and doing a match on top of that it's also going to be hard especially if you want to have a strong like you you don't want to have like just a match if you're pulling somebody you want to beat like
SPEAKER_01: devon you want to beat some even if you go for a lower you know guy that you wanna not my name but the name you want to remember you have to be serious two two things i i can do um one thing just i would try to be best under 85 kilo and the second thing second thing i would like to do to try to do something very close to mission impossible that has a meaning like like pulling on garbaev
SPEAKER_01: Even if Ongar Bayev is better than if, if I say if, even if better than Devon, I would like choose not to become the best, but I would, pulling Devon or pulling John would have a different meaning, you understand? Than them pulling those other guys, you understand? I don't have any dream of becoming the best in 100 kilo. That's not going to happen, you understand? But if I'm going to, if I'm going to pull Devon, if I'm going to pull John,
SPEAKER_01: I would just do that the crazy thing and try to be a hundred kilo, you understand? But I wouldn't want to be, try to stay at a hundred kilo and become the best there. I cannot do it. And again, somebody will say, if you cannot become the best in a hundred kilo, how can you be Devon or something? Which I think that Devon, I don't think that Devon is the best hundred kilo. He may be, he may not be, but I don't have a plan to stay there. I would plan to stay 90 kilo.
SPEAKER_01: and make 85 kilos and try to be the best. You can say that you cannot become the best 85 kilos. I mean, I just flashed 5-0, the current WAF champion. And we all know that from 55 kilos, Artem to 90 kilos, all the best guys are in WAF. Even maybe in up to 100 kilos, you know, look at the 100 kilos in the professional, look at the things that Ongar Bayev is doing in WAF. I don't think he has been even a finalist.
SPEAKER_01: i think not maybe third place yes but for sure he didn't win anymore and he has been competing for many years i've heard you say it earlier but i was not sure no never one never one it's not that easy prudently last a few years i i know people you mean you mean you can have interesting discussion you know uh one time maybe you remember this because it was an armed power maybe but uh i remember zambalat zambalat sorry zambalat has a good story
SPEAKER_04: If you know about this example a lot, he won.
SPEAKER_04: Fuck, he won Zloty first. He won Zloty first. Only then, a couple years later, he maybe won WEF, and he still could not win Russian Nationals. I don't remember. Zloty was first. Yeah, I think Zloty was first. Then maybe he placed at WEF, but he could never win Russian Nationals. But Zloty was the easiest one out of the three. Then WEF, you cannot, because everybody shows.
SPEAKER_01: That type of thing. But you know, Russian nationals back in the day were crazy too. They were like, you know, if you're top five for Russian nationals. I spoke with Cobra. Cobra said that he's 80 kilos now. Cobra wants to be 80 kilo number one guy in the world by May. He told me on the phone, he said, just give me just one second. We are finishing, but just one second.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you could be right. I think or under by if you're not doesn't have WF titles. Oh, okay. So just me over here. Yeah, I mean, he said that he probably is thinking that Yannis is the best guy in the world under there. But he said that he would like to he would like to
SPEAKER_01: He said he's going to beat Yannis in a year or something in less than a year. But you know, just there are some other guys like, you know, have you seen matches with Makaro and Alain Zola with Yannis at the last swap? I did not see Yannis in them. I know Alain and Artur. I did not see Yannis in the mix. So first Artur and Yannis met and Yannis just started. Artur hold him and just flash pinned him.
SPEAKER_01: And then Arthur and Alan pulled. It was a long match, which Arthur won by fouls. And after that match, Alan met Yannis. He also beat him comfortably, very comfortably. Yeah. So those two were just like much above.
SPEAKER_01: the rest of the poolers. So Cobra said he's coming back. Maybe he should pull Yanis. I think Cobra and Yanis can pull in a legend category as well. In my opinion, Yanis is another legend. He's not young anymore. He's over 40 as well. But, you know, let's see. Let's see how it will be, you know. But again, if I pull, two reasons, again, I'm repeating. One is just to become the best under 85 kilo. I don't know if I can or not.
SPEAKER_01: And the two, if I pull something like that one, John, as I said, you know, like that, yeah. I don't have any intention to pull Ungarbe or Zurab or whoever, you know, I don't have any kind of intention. Let's see first, you know, if my elbows are gonna handle or not, I would love to, trust me, I pay a lot of money. If I didn't have intention to come back,
SPEAKER_01: I didn't have, I wouldn't try to, um, have that pain, you know, just like I can show you, but it is just still here. So bloody you see here. Yeah. Yeah. And they, they took from there, they put from the both sides, they put the vacuum four holes and they took the fats. They, they separated the cells and they injected elbow, wrist, middle knuckles, knees. It was very painful and very expensive.
SPEAKER_01: So I really want to, because all my life I pull now it hurts me. I cannot leave. It hurts elbows and everything, you know? So, and I just feel like I'm a, like a Eagle with broken, you know, wings, you know, just that I feel, I feel so, uh, terrible, terrible. Yeah. Let's see. Let's see my friend. And yeah, maybe, maybe I should pull. Do you think that after.
SPEAKER_01: if I started pulling tough, you know, just if I feel good, and then you are saying that I should start pulling not with someone like John or something, I should start slowly, right?
SPEAKER_04: all right find a good find maybe a good person from out here in the weight class right i'm just saying you should definitely not do it as you're organizing right because it's going to be crazy pick an event pick that person really the best way for you to do it so you can be in a great shape and you are not going crazy with this preparation for like something like other you have to want to make sure like maybe like what you did with john like it's someone someone else's tournament
SPEAKER_04: Well, you don't have to prepare, like, you know, be picking up, you know, where you're not going crazy with other things because it's important. Pooling and organizing is hard. So pick a tournament or a big event that's, you know, not yours. So you can, you know, go after the person. Yeah. I just like psychologically, you know, just like if somebody is challenging me.
SPEAKER_01: like like that one is doing you understand and then it just hold you do you have an interest of somebody from america you know maybe under you know anybody interested from out here like i will i will pull someone like i will just check the results of it maybe i would pull i would pull maybe 85 kilo bojidar simeno aha okay so like yeah
SPEAKER_01: Okay. I think I would pull. So what if Adam beats Tim? Will you want to pull Adam from America? I don't know. As I said, I want to become best under 85 kilos. Adam is 95 kilos. He is making 92 kilos with the agreement with Bozidar. I would pull Adam, but I don't have any goal to become a 95 kilos best. I cannot. No way. 85 kilos, maybe.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe, you understand, maybe 10% chance I can. But 95 kilo, there's Sasho, which even when I think about it, just my elbows already hurt. Whenever I think of his, you know, even you make his palm go up and you block his wrist, to pin him is still problematic. You know, he can give you everything like this. He can still hit you sideways. You know, he just, his joints are, I don't think my joint would handle
SPEAKER_01: such a pressure, you understand? Many people, when you put them in that position, it's almost over. Not the case with him, you understand? He already gives you that. I don't know how he's applying that pressure. Maybe, did you see his match with Taino, Artem Taino? Hold on, what we're talking about, I missed the name.
SPEAKER_01: What's that? I missed the name. Who are we talking about? Who are we talking about? Sasho. Sasho. Oh, yeah. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. You're right. Sasho. But do you know how Artem Taino beat him? Artem Taino went out like this and he was like this. So what Artem did just to...
SPEAKER_01: Catch him, I know Sasho gave up many things from the angles. He just came and pressed his pronator, but he was open in here. But he was still, if Taino tried to go out, his pronator would get tired and then it would beat him. But what Taino did was very smart. When Sasho got open,
SPEAKER_01: And Tino, suddenly when he is like this, he just went jump and then press his bicep. He won't easily. So he opened up the arm. Yeah, yeah. He opened up the arm. But so one needs to have that kind of elbow held, you know, just to put that pressure as well. Right. That's all it is. Yeah. If your elbow doesn't feel like that, you cannot go sideways like that. No, you're right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Who says that? Jay? He wants to someone. Oh, Jay, he's talking about that. By the way, guys, if you are listening,
SPEAKER_01: Rustam Babaev will be part of the East versus West in January. Rustam Babaev is making a comeback, and he will be part of the East versus West, and most likely someone from America. Most likely. But just remember, don't expect him to be in a super, super shape. He is making a comeback, you know, after 2019. Hold on. I feel like I already know who's pulling.
SPEAKER_04: But we don't know. We need to check the results of some matches. Hold on. I was thinking he needs to pull Todd Hutchings. I don't know the results, but I think he needs to pull him. That's like the last person to disrespect Todd Hutchings, right? At a similar weight. See, Todd Hutchings...
SPEAKER_01: Um, maybe that, that shouldn't be the start for Rustom because it is coming back after three years. It's a great match for Todd. Usually it doesn't end up good for Todd, but you know, hopefully it will change because Rustom's trial is very explosive, very explosive. And then usually right before, before Todd even positions, the match is over, you know, he beat him before at the Zloty Tour and he also beat him in a super match 6-0.
SPEAKER_01: uh after zloty and so that that i don't know i don't think but also rushtam wouldn't i don't these guys are not that that like crazy you know like me you know they would just come and they like arsene lily he was getting ready and i talked with arsene arsene stop training it is because uh the russian government asked certain age groups to the army and they are all waiting to be called
SPEAKER_01: to the army, and he said that it's not possible to get out of the region for those people. They cannot. So he said that he can't really motivate himself while he's thinking that he may be called to army. It is not that possible for him to get crazy and trained and motivated. I'm going to come and pull internationally. I hardly convinced him. And now this happened, so he may not be coming.
SPEAKER_01: yeah let's see how it happens and i hope everything is fine and i know that people are just gonna storm me on the social media because i said you know i would be pulling devon and i would hit him sideways they were just you know you know yeah there are a lot of them they just go like oh you're delusional i mean trust me uh artem i am the last person to be uh called delusional when you do a lot of crazy things
SPEAKER_01: I won my first world title in 1994. I won last world title in Seniors, you know, 2018. So if anyone, and people said, oh, when you win, it was in the past when arm wrestling was easy. And how is it that I won 2018 Worlds, 2018 Zloty, beating Minda Aguas, almost beating Arthur Nguyen. That's not far. That's not that far. Beating Viorel Dobre. And now who is the world champion? Viorel Dobre, now beat him. Bojidar, 80 kilo world champion. Ask Bojidar.
SPEAKER_01: would you be 100% sure beating Engin? I am not saying I would beat him 100%, but he would tell you that he wouldn't be sure of beating me either, you know. But those people at the top, they show me enough respect, while these keyboard warriors, you know, they just go, oh, this and this and that, that, that, that, you know, just, I mean, that drives me crazy, you know. Anyway, so. Yes, sir. Thank you, thank you. It has been 20 and a half hour, and I think that if we both would have time, we would,
SPEAKER_04: we could talk about our mess in five hours i think you and i we should do podcasts together we can but we have to we have to block a day like from from eight in the morning till eight at night if you're there we definitely can't yeah no no but we can do a weekly podcast or something you know and then talk about yeah make it part of this channel or east versus west yeah whatever yeah yeah it's better
SPEAKER_01: yeah not this channel the east versus west channel is good so that you know we can make it yeah and me and you can have live episodes whenever i'm in turkey we can have like one hour thing set a camera both of us in the same place but i think i think i will be super busy and i want you to just
SPEAKER_04: just cover everything just yeah i'll be out yeah i did not i was you know i have ideas right i know i'm gonna you know it's easy you got an athlete ask questions post but the more you post like the guests here new oh there's so many people
SPEAKER_04: yeah it's great it's great it's a great that's why i always wanted to do that that's why i wanted to message you like me when me and pradeep were talking yeah i've been i've been talking to england like man i had that i guess you don't want to talk to angel until i had it but now because we're in the same page like it is awesome because you have all those people out there my friend my friend i have passion for arm wrestling and with anyone who has that passion and some abilities that i don't have
SPEAKER_01: but it is needed. Understand that that makes a good team. So while you are here, it's the perfect time, you know, to do all kinds of interviews, you can be you are going to be the interviewer after the matches on the stage, because I also speak Russian.

SPEAKER_04: not a good idea you guys realized that right then that's why you stopped no no no no no no no no we didn't realize that we are devon got busy pulling levon devon liked the idea even more than me uh it was i did not i personally i stopped it myself because i know i cannot do it myself because then it's gonna be me making fun of other people
SPEAKER_04: When it's me and Devin, we were kind of discussing why it's bad, and it's me and Devin, it's between us, and then we're like, well... We were just discussing it and making sure that it's kind of less offensive. We will make fun of you, but, you know, we're also like, what's good, what's bad.
SPEAKER_04: That's why, while he could not be part of it, I did not do those because now it's just me talking shit. Like, it's not good. Like, no, no, no. Devon has to be there because Devon likes it. Devon enjoyed doing those, and it was really easy. And people love those. Like, people keep asking about those. I'm like, yeah, I can't do them myself because, as you said, it's not a great idea. I feel for the same way for some of Devon's training as well.
SPEAKER_04: right right and that's why there was an episode that never came out there was an episode of like uh not that there was a lot of episodes that i wrote down that it was great ideas like just doing some random it was one episode just about devon stuff right
SPEAKER_04: Nobody was safe. The last episode was about me and him, I think, right? We were making fun of the stupid stuff that I've done, the stuff that he's done. We were making fun of us. I thought you guys were only making fun of other people.
SPEAKER_04: No, no, no, no, no. One of the, like, one of the episodes, we're like, hey, let's be honest. Like, we need to start with a clear state. And I start making fun of, like, I found my videos of me doing, like, silly stuff. I found Devon's stuff. You know, we made fun of us, too, included. Wow, okay, okay. So you were objective. Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we knew, we knew, like, we want to make sure that if you're talking bad about somebody, we want to make sure why, because me and him disagreed on some stuff, right? Because I, you know, like lots of like, vertical stuff, and me and him were debating, it was fairly healthy. But you're right, the idea is, you know, you don't make too many friends that way. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so
SPEAKER_04: yes sir let's we have to wrap it up this time this time i'm not opening another subject okay everybody sign the youtube engine i'll see you in the five weeks bye-bye
