SPEAKER_04: World workout, training pronator statistically is better overall than training pronatical motion. I think we need to train both of them.

SPEAKER_02: I hear you. You, me, no. I can't hear you. Now? Yeah, now, yes. Yeah? Yeah, what happened? I don't know what happened. Because you made something? Okay. Too much power inside, my friend. Too much power here.
SPEAKER_04: and so you have so much power in you and then you put extra power out in the night yeah okay come on you did something technical there and that's why you asked me if i hear you now jerry is here as well are you are you nervous that jerry is coming
SPEAKER_04: why i'm just i like to tease you because you are younger than me and i because yeah i'm happy to be here yeah i know i know i know um i don't know jerry still trying to come but maybe okay big daddy came hello hello jerry what's up
SPEAKER_01: Hello, hello. How are you? I'm fine, you? Living the dream. Dream? Living the dream. Let me figure out how to set this freaking thing up. Okay. Jerry, you look bigger than the
SPEAKER_04: Last time I saw you. I'm in better shape. Yeah, I can see that. I can see that. So, how is everything, Jerry? Feeling good? Yeah, I feel kind of bad. Why? For Hermes. Oh, okay, okay. I know you have a good heart. I know you have a good heart. And he is young enough to be almost your son. And then you will just come and beat him. It's just...
SPEAKER_04: I understand why you feel bad. Yeah, he can chalk it up as a lesson. Oh, okay. It will be part of the learning, right? Experience for him. Yeah. And Hermes? Listen, listen, I just had operation. Oh, they took fat cells, you know, for stem cell from my belly, you know, here.
SPEAKER_04: Now, whenever I laugh so much, it's hurting me. Okay, not so much laughing, Hermes. Or, you know, I will be bleeding here. So, what do you think about Hermes? Is it going to be an experience for you? A bitter experience? No. Every match is an experience. Yeah, but is it going to be a negative experience or a positive experience for you?
SPEAKER_02: absolutely positive positive he don't know what we will happen november he doesn't realize that he doesn't even realize no he's dreaming too much it's beautiful dreaming
SPEAKER_04: Hermes has to pinch himself and wake up. What? You need to pinch yourself to wake up. Wake up. You need to pinch. He's still sleeping. No, no. I wake up this morning. Yeah. It'll be fun. Yeah, Jerry, just go back to August 6th
SPEAKER_04: night you beat Gennady and here you are about six weeks before your match with Hermes and can you say you feel more confident than other six nights or about the same? How do you see yourself?
SPEAKER_01: same same i feel yeah i i never go in thinking you're gonna lose always go in you know visualizing yourself to win if you think you're gonna lose don't show up right so yeah yeah the uh i expect ermys thinks he's gonna win i expect i think i'm gonna win and uh i think it's gonna be good match um you know i have my ideas he's gonna have his ideas so it'll
SPEAKER_04: But Jerry, a good match means a tough match. Do you see Hermes winning a tough match against you? Honestly. The only way he's not going to beat me in a long match.
SPEAKER_01: the only chance he has is if he wins in the first few seconds, right? He's not gonna outlast me. He's got an explosive hit, he's strong, and he transitions well, right? So all three of those factors need to happen at the highest level in order to take me out of position. As quick as possible.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he has to be fast, he has to transition quick, and he has to be strong, right? So if those three factors are all at 100%, then it could be a tough match. The question, by objective judgment, we know Hermes is a very explosive puller, and we know you are very fast as well at the start. How do you see the speed of
SPEAKER_01: like compared to each other both of you i think he's explosive back right now i'm explosive diving in so it's yeah it's gonna come down to i think one of the major differences is gonna be that he's never pulled anyone like me right and uh i think that daddy remember i told you i go in the hook remember inside
SPEAKER_01: you're gonna hey ermine absolutely uh engen can we get that written up um i i i don't think he is serious hold on my back there um i don't i don't think he's serious so i don't think he's gonna go inside with you now we have it recorded he said he'll go inside the hook
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, maybe he's joking. I mean, just, I mean, I don't know. Ask him, you know. I have a question for you. What match do you want to go inside the hook, Armys? All of them? What? I don't know. Which match do you want to go in? All of them in the hook? Which match? Which round? Which rounds? All rounds? Which round? First round? Yeah, you will go inside the hook with him? Every round?
SPEAKER_02: First three? First round. No? Yeah, first round. Okay. That'll be good. Hermes, are you serious or not? The people don't... They show me go only in the top row, but...
SPEAKER_02: is not only my way good technique, you understand. I can go in side pressure, I can go in a high hook, like this I'm stronger in this technique too. Depends of my or who I challenge. Yeah, but when you say hook,
SPEAKER_02: If you mean high hook, I understand. But you don't mean like fully go inside spinated hook, right? I never try in the competition, hard competition. But the people, they never see me go inside like this. I think you should.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. I mean, I see, I see, I see Hermes maybe trying going sideways, maybe, but deep hook, I mean, there are better ways to suicide. I mean, one round, Gennady tried that. I was thinking that Gennady could do something, but once he tried to hook, the same second he got pressed, you know, like, do you think that
SPEAKER_02: You're talking about going fully inside and aren't you afraid that you may get... Or are you playing mind games, Hermes? We'll see, my friend. We'll see. Maybe he will feel my power and he won't laugh anymore. Understand? He doesn't know.
SPEAKER_02: He doesn't know my power. He thinks I'm the same as Travis Beige, but he doesn't understand that. Hermes, do you think your shape is better than Travis's best shape? Sure. Now it's a different level. You know.
SPEAKER_02: So today is armwrestling in different level? Different level. The super heavyweight is different level. In the heavyweight, little more, but you know, John Brzezinski, now he still beat a good champion. But in the super heavyweight, I think another level now. Yeah, but how did Gennady beat Dave?
SPEAKER_02: And Dave is beating Vitaly. And like Jerry beat Gennady. So, I mean, Jerry would know better, you know. Jerry, today's arm wrestling is totally different level or how do you see that? Gennady, he told me the second round he has an injury in the chest here. It's because he couldn't go the side like the first round.
SPEAKER_02: So he says that's why he lost? Yeah. And I think he underestimated too much Gerrard. You know, when you underestimate, you don't push yourself 100%. You understand? So you are saying that basically, Gerrard... Because Gerrard is, I don't know, now is...
SPEAKER_02: When was your last match before Gennady? Five years ago? Two and a half. Two and a half. Two and a half is a big time. Yeah, but two and a half years, almost everyone is inactive. Because of the pandemic, everyone is inactive the last two years. The people are still training in the pandemic. Yeah, I didn't say I wasn't. I just didn't...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, people, nobody competed, yeah. Somebody's saying they only lost Levan first round. I mean, the Supermatch has never been one round first round, my friend. It has nothing to do first round. You go Supermatch, you go by accepting the rules, which are also the number of the rounds, and then that's how you win, you know. Dave is my good friend, but I mean, come on, you know.
SPEAKER_04: Anyway, so what I just tried to say, I think, I don't know, Jerry, do you feel yourself like, do you feel yourself like, I mean, behind today's superhighways as Hermes is climbing, because he says that Gennady lost to you only because of that reason?
SPEAKER_01: We know that's not why he lost. Right. But I think everyone wants to come up with excuses. Don't be a sore loser. Right. I mean, it is what it is. There were battles. It was a long war. Right. And each match was difficult. The only one that I think to that. But after he told me like this, I saw the video very good. And the second round, if you if you see
SPEAKER_02: the video, he continued like this before the second round. He told me he was injured when he fell in Dubai. After this, he trained like this and the injury grew up. He told me like this. After, I don't know
SPEAKER_04: I saw a video of him training last month, so it must have been a real bad injury. The truth is, he asked me to set a match for November right after the East versus West in August. After his match, he asked me to set a match for East versus West 5. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but I told him to just a little bit rest. But I don't. For me, it's not important. The chest injury. I'm another athlete, another person. But so you are basically saying, from what I understand, Gennady lost to Jerry because he got injured. So it's just, in your opinion, Jerry is not at your level. No. No?
SPEAKER_02: You don't say this or he's not at your level? I know if I wait in the same position like Gennady and I see I wait in his position and I hold him like this for two minutes, I know maybe I lose 90%. I want to...
SPEAKER_02: to to don't go in in this position you understand but everybody know this this position is very dangerous with it everybody know or not i understand i understand but but hermes do you think that jerry in this event against you will be stronger than uh how he was in august
SPEAKER_02: maybe a little bit yes because we have a genetic we prepare training like this but in the two three months it is difficult to change it 50 percent or i understand but if you think that jerry wasn't training for two years and then he came with three months training
SPEAKER_04: Gennady, now he had another three and a half months. Do you think maybe he could be better because of more training? I think he will become better than when he fought with Gennady. In August, yeah. Whenever you look at Jerry now from the screen with those shoulders and biceps, are you getting intimidated? No, I knew he'd be. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But the important, my friend, is the quality, not fat. You understand? Fat? Do you think Jenny is fat? Yeah, too. Is the quality masculine important for the power? I have another...
SPEAKER_02: I think the weight, yes, is important, but not too much. Look at Dadikian with Morozov. There are 20 kg, 20 kg difference weight. And Dadikian, the first, the second, the first round, he won very easily. Or not. He lost for endurance.
SPEAKER_02: Depends, same John Brzezink with Szyplenko. John Brzezink, I know John Brzezink is a legend like this, but there are, in the Sloty tour, he was 95 and Denis 140, more or less. It's a 45 kilo difference.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the weight is important, but not too much. I know if I will go in Istanbul, maybe 140 kilos, an example. But with fat like this, the fat is not important for the power, you understand? So why are you saying... The fat is good, but not too much. Do you think jelly is fat?
SPEAKER_04: More than me, sure. Because he likes to drink too much. Jerry, what do you think about all this? You know, he's talking, talking, talking, but it looks like he's not intimidated by you. He doesn't give a, you know, shit. You know, he just... Yeah, you know, it's like a keyboard warrior, right? You can talk all the shit you want. You can say whatever you want, but...
SPEAKER_02: I know he's going to be nervous when he's on the other side of the table. Every time I'm nervous because this is normal when I have a match. You know I'm nervous, you are normal, normal like going to the bar. No, my friend. You will feel after the first round,
SPEAKER_04: You are more, more, more nervous than me. More, more, more. Oh, you mean, you mean, you mean, Hermes, you mean after first and two rounds, he will be more nervous because he will realize that his next opponent will be Levan? Maybe, yes. We don't know.
SPEAKER_04: i like to tease you anyways i like to tease you yeah and jenny what what does he think you know you say something and he starts talking you never finish your work what is he talking about he he thinks you're fat he thinks you are not at their level he says i'm messing in supreme with different level you are a has-been travis has been just tell us
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I think he's a delusional, but I mean, you, you gotta be a little bit excited, right? I mean, if he's going to go in with this type of attitude, I want him to think that he's going to win. I want him to come in strong. I want him to come in ready, you know? So when we go, I get the best version of Hermes, right? Because he's been progressively getting better. You know, it's just, uh, I don't want to, I don't want to beat up on a little guy. Hmm.
SPEAKER_04: i understand i understand um there is a there is a question so i'm trying to you know get smaller so he won't think i'm fat he will get smaller so you will not think he is fat he will get smaller so you will think that his chance is bigger because he is less fat now i don't understand
SPEAKER_04: He is going to lose weight. Less fat. He will get smaller. He will get more ripped. He will lose his fat. Yeah? Nice. And you will think that he has now more chance because he will lose weight. Because you think that when you lose weight, you are less fat and you are stronger. I don't know. Everyone has a difference.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, no. There is a there is a super chat. He says the razors. Thank you for supporting it will be a war. We know how capable Jerry is. Everything depends on how sharp Hermes will be. Like how good shape you enjoy that. I don't know how to pronounce that. Sorry, Williams, Jerry will break arm before getting ping.
SPEAKER_04: Jerry will break arm before getting pinned. It means that you're gonna probably put your everything. I don't know what it means. Anyway, so let's see here the results. 54% Hermes, 46% Jerry after 177 watts.
SPEAKER_04: Must be all the Europeans. Yeah. The young buck. Just to let people know, guys, this is our main event. This is the East versus West right arm world super heavyweight title. The title holder is Jerry Catherett. And Hermes is the challenger.
SPEAKER_04: and this is our main event at the East versus West five. And this is the, so far, most likely looking the best event, best cards. All of them are good, but this is even better in my opinion and in other people's opinions. Jerry, you have been pulling for around 30 years and have you pulled people like Hermes, you pulled against a lot of top rollers,
SPEAKER_04: And who do you think that because you, I mean whenever you're pulling with people, people try to top roll you so everyone is naturally a tablet even touching side stop roll you. So what i'm just trying to say, who is this top role and Mrs like. Well.
SPEAKER_01: i'm thinking that ermys is going to come in like travis was in his best shape right because travis when we went against each other in oh six i think it was when we went for a 15 grand um travis came in like 290 and uh strong in the best shape just got done beaten um uh
SPEAKER_01: what's his name, the bobsledder from Russia. Oh, Alexey Voevoda. Yeah, he just beat Voevoda for the world title. And I went against Travis and he was in great shape. And we know that he was phenomenally fast. We know that he was super strong. And I'm envisioning that Hermes is going to come in at that level, right? So that's saying a lot, right? Because, I mean, Travis was at the time the best in the world.
SPEAKER_04: in uh until our match right and then uh i beat him i understand so stylistically stylistic one is austin other one is full hand control hermes is with the full hand wrist control while travis is most like austin top load but stylistically i mean who who do you think that you have faced in the past that pulls like hermes
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I know you have pulled a lot of people, but. Yeah. Yeah. I pulled a lot of people. I mean, I, uh, I don't know. I mean, the other, the other genius when it comes to matches, you, you don't forget a thing. So who would you say I went against that, that I should be equating them to? I mean, I've pulled every, every person there was really, you know?
SPEAKER_01: i pulled uh you know gary when he was at his best right but he was more of a top role um then uh richard was just strong right then uh different style yeah maybe you haven't pulled someone like hermes either or not possible i don't know i mean uh i pulled the whole bunch of times against john right and john i think is probably one of the smartest pullers yes yes yes yes and uh
SPEAKER_04: Paul Devin. So I don't know. I mean, I know you pull all the best, but stylistically do they like maybe John with a good hand control? But do you think John was as explosive as Hermes? No. That's why I say I think the best one for me to
SPEAKER_01: envision him being with Travis because to me it doesn't matter if you want to go high hand if you want to go low hand if you're just going to do this couple all that matters to me is that I can get into my position and then stop them from getting me outside my shoulder if if I stop them from getting me outside my shoulder you know and I can stop the match I'm going to win the match do you think there is any possibility Adam has to go sideways against you
SPEAKER_01: No. If he goes inside, then like Gennady's match three. What's that? I said if he tries to go inside, it'll end like Gennady's match on number three. Or was it not Gennady trying to go inside? He was trying to go sideways? He went inside, but I felt like he was trying to go sideways, but he tried to do it with hand control inside. And then I went inside and did a shoulder roll and then was able to go in a hook and press.
SPEAKER_04: But do you realize that, I know you will be much stronger, but you will, like, I can say that, for example, Gennady may have stronger hook than Hermes inside and maybe more horsepower, but he pulled against you. The only way he had against you was top roll. But when it comes to top roll, Hermes is a better and stronger top roller than Gennady. You realize that, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah. So that is why probably in the shape that you were in August wouldn't be enough for Hermes. But you had to be better than August because his outside skill is his profession. You know, he's incredible, but totally outside. Wrist, pronated. While Gennady is more divided. He can go hook, even dead press and top roll and everything, you know.
SPEAKER_04: And Hermes also can do that, but his main thing is top roll. And then he may do the transition to shoulder pressure after he takes the wrist. Yeah. So what do you think about this? That, you know, you agree that, you know, you have to be in a better shape than your other shape to beat Hermes? Yeah, I agree.
SPEAKER_01: understand but i mean if you look at if you look at me physically before that last match and look at me physically now you you should be able to see somewhat of a transformation a little bit you know what i see right now is bigger than last time when i did the interview with you before the gennady match for sure you look you look in better shape yeah
SPEAKER_01: But you know yourself better. Yeah, I mean, my weight levels are going up. Not my body weight. My body weight's coming down, but my strength is going up, right? So right now I'm probably 318, 317. And for Gennady, I weighed in at 326. And so I'm down like eight pounds, but my strength is up.
SPEAKER_04: So you are less fat now, so it means that you are more dangerous, right, Hermes? That's right. That's why I said it. Look, ready? Oh, Hermes is in trouble. Where's Hermes' abs? Are you fat on your stomach? Show your stomach. Show my stomach. A little bit, but not too much. Oh, that's a chunky bunkie.
SPEAKER_04: okay there is one thank you Yanis for your super chat or support if you don't have question and thank you for your super chat Hermes looks nervous than ever he can't hide it are you very nervous or annoyed no I'm I'm tired today but uh no
SPEAKER_02: Yes, every time. I repeat, every time when I have a fight, it's normal to be nervous. But are you nervous already or you will be nervous at the competition? A little bit, but it's normal. Because now you are chatting with your opponent, maybe it makes you a little bit like... I remember when I was too nervous,
SPEAKER_02: a lot, a lot, is when I fought with Matt Mask the second time. Revenge, you know. I understand, yeah. But now, yes, a little bit, it's normal. Can I ask you something, Ernesto? It's better to be nervous than not nervous. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, being nervous is, in fact, necessary.
SPEAKER_04: But if you mix it with fear, it's bad. If you mix it with courage, then it gives you even more power. I have a question. This match, everyone in the armwrestling world community, I mean, they are thinking this is a qualification match to face Levan. And if this is the fact, this is one of the reason that makes you extra nervous?
SPEAKER_02: because to face Levan, you need to win this match. That also makes you a little bit extra nervous? Yes and no, because I don't think I lose. I think I will win, maybe easy. But if I lose with
SPEAKER_02: 2%. No, there are only 2% I lose. If I lose in the 2%, next year I compete with another athlete. And I don't think he can beat Levan. If he beat me in the 2%, I remember.
SPEAKER_02: Because Levan, if you go inside and he has control, it's impossible to beat Levan. Only this way is a little bit open his wrist. This is the only way to beat Levan. But with his technique, yes, maybe for me, for the top role, it's dangerous. But for Levan, no chance.
SPEAKER_04: Because Levan can go side pressure very strong. He has too much power. Side pressure. He is too close. I understand. I understand. So you are saying that if Jerry beats you, he will barely beat you. But there is a possibility that you will beat him easily. This is how you estimate the match. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think I beat him very easily. I understand. Maybe in the first round, I give him a possibility to put himself in his best position to try his power. So you are saying that if you win two rounds easy and then third round, maybe you would allow him to put his power
SPEAKER_04: and then control him like where the Gennady was. Yeah. But don't you think it's risky? After 2-0, just one mistake, and then you get exhausted and then lose the next two rounds. We see the first and the second round. Okay, you will understand if you can do such things. And I want to feel my arm is too much pumped or not. But if you are totally fresh, if you beat him easy, you will also control him. That's what we are saying.
SPEAKER_04: There is a super chat. Yannis says, thank you, my friend. Do they think they could beat Levan in the future? I think Ermes already answered this. And what do you think about this, Jerry? No, you already answered. I will ask you too. What do you think about this, Jerry? You versus Levan or you are only concentrated on Ermes right now?
SPEAKER_01: No, no. Obviously, Levan's on the radar because Ermi's match is, you know, I've already won that. And I think that with Levan, I think he's in the same boat where he's super strong. I'm cutting you. Did you just say that you already beat Ermes? Yeah, in my mind, I've already won that match. Oh, you already won Ermes' match? And now, okay, you can focus on the...
SPEAKER_04: No, I'm not. Okay, because I was. If Adam is on the. He said, I got a 2% chance of winning right 2%. That's not what he said. Let me explain. He said that he thinks he's gonna beat you easy. But he said, if you beat him,
SPEAKER_04: It will be only, you will be like 2% better than him, better than him. No, he will say, yeah, yeah. He doesn't say that you have 2% chance, but he said that if you lose, I think it will be by 2%, you will be stronger than him. Or maybe I misunderstood you. Maybe I misunderstood. How did you say about 2% Hermes?
SPEAKER_02: His chance of winning is 2%? Or if he wins, he will be only 2% stronger than you? What did you mean? No, no. He has only 2% to win with me. Oh, okay. Jerry, you are right. You are right. I understand. I understood. He understands, my friend. Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah. That's all right. But he needs to know. He has a better chance of hitting one of those scratch tickets and winning that than he does of winning against me.
SPEAKER_01: So he should go out and play like the Powerball. I don't know if they have that in Europe, Powerball and the lottery, right? The chance that you win lottery is higher than beating geniuses.
SPEAKER_01: So to answer the question about LaVon, uh, training would be different for LaVon because what I'm training for right now is to be Hermes, knowing that he's going to come out of my hand. I think LaVon is going to just try to do straight power straight through. So, you know, I won't dive across the table like I would with, uh, Hermes. So it'll be different. I understand.
SPEAKER_04: I'll put more weight on. I'll come in fatter for that match. Leaner for Ermes, fatter for Levan. I understand. So you are saying that after you beat Ermes, you're going to train differently for Levan? Yep. I understand. And there is another question. Does Ermes mean only a top-roller can beat Levan? Ermes, you think only a top-roller can beat Levan? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yes. Only a top-roller? Okay, I understand. I saw only one moment when he... Vitaly? No, he was in a difficult position. Do you remember the first round when he fought with Trubin?
SPEAKER_02: Now it's a different level. No, I know now it's a different level. Four weeks from the 2018 WAF to the Zloty four weeks and that was a tested tournament. And what we saw after that is totally different. Yes, I understand. But I think this is a good way to
SPEAKER_04: to take the position with him. I understand. I understand. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. And it will be very, very, very intense match. As I said, this is the main event, main event at the end of the year and super heavyweight East versus West world title with the right arm.
SPEAKER_04: And let's see, let's see, it will be breath cutting. And Hermes, you, I see you even sometimes when we chat, you look very confident, very confident. So it is probably because your shape is very good. I think that I saw you some lately, physics, you know, you look at the different level than before. Am I right? Or maybe I missed something?
SPEAKER_02: i think yes now very good shape now yeah and do you think in six weeks we will see even something more i understand not 30 percent more like five percent maybe five yes because in the fight you have only the mind the aggressive mind grow up your power
SPEAKER_04: a lot. Anyway, so let's see. Let's see. Let's see how we will be. I mean, I just can't wait to watch the event and it will be bread cutting, you know, bread cutting. And I mean, to be honest, Hermes before before Gennady versus Jerry match, I really didn't think Jerry had so much chance, but he won. Now he's coming in.
SPEAKER_04: better shape i know you're also in incredible shape so i don't know what's going to happen there i really don't know what's going to happen there and time will show only the time will show and anything anything jerry no just uh what size shirt does hermes have on a medium or large a medium okay medium yeah
SPEAKER_01: That is enough for you, my friend. I need you to come in heavier. Get a little bit bigger. That is enough. Believe me. Believe me. It's enough. What are you weighing, like 250, 240? I don't know. Are you 110 kilos, he's asking. 105. Five? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's going to be fun. I think it's going to be good. I'm looking forward to it. I expect a good match. I want him to come in strong. You know, I don't want to beat up on a little kid. I want him to, you know, at least get stronger. I understand. I want to ask the chat who hide all those guys and now we are unhitting them. Who did that? I mean, if there is a problem, I will
SPEAKER_04: Is any of the moderators are causing problems? Anyway, so I don't know. Let's see, let's see, let's see how it will be. And you also will have another match, not the main event, but we can say maybe like third main event, fourth main event, but still, you know, very important match. And does it, does it take your attention away from this, this match? What?
SPEAKER_04: I mean to, to, you know, at the end of the, you wanted to pull Jerry early because you take Jerry so seriously that you don't want to spend any of the energy before, before the Jerry match. So what I'm just saying, but still two matches later, you will have Morozov match. And to think that you have a Morozov match, does it take your attention from there, a Jerry match or not? Or you are just talking to me.
SPEAKER_04: uh these are another important match but my focus is more with right arm yeah yeah yeah i understand yeah yeah as i said you know this looks like it's a qualification match to pull levan you know to me right now it's the most important match in the world because we are trying to find an opponent for levan everyone is looking for an opponent and now everybody's eyes are here
SPEAKER_04: know who's gonna win this match you know so people are trying to find an opponent for um um the one um the thing is do you think um you will have another uh chat with morozov as well but you watch the daddy cam versus morozov match yeah just shortly i will ask you after you watch that match
SPEAKER_02: you think your chances are now higher or lower? Honestly. Honestly? Honestly, I know that he has a very, very strong hand and a finger. Yeah. You showed a good response. And I think I have a little more chance after this one.
SPEAKER_02: but i don't like it too much this match because there are no fire too much friendly i don't like this this yeah but sometimes when you are very very best and your your good friend is also best yeah i understand but when you fight not too much you understand he don't yeah
SPEAKER_04: He's 100% power, I think. I understand, I understand. So you are saying that after you watched Dadikian versus Morozov, your chance against Morozov is now higher than before? This is how you feel? Yes, yes. I understand, yes. There is a super chat. Avi, what is your thought about the chances? Time will show. I'm the organizer. I cannot... I cannot have...
SPEAKER_04: any opinion hector about ermes do you still want to pull devon there's a super chat thank you he don't accept with me never he what he know he will lose oh he will not pull against you because he knows that he will lose oh now he want to go down with the weight
SPEAKER_02: because he here is very difficult for for him the top roller like me is very dangerous for him with his control i understand um let's see let's see how it will be and um i have a few questions about your
SPEAKER_04: uh predictions about some a few other matches jerry i will ask you uh how do you see michael versus prudnik match how do i see it yeah michael's gonna come in at 250 i think he's gonna have a tough time
SPEAKER_01: Um, after watching Prudnik and Todd Hutchins, and then Michael and Todd Hutchins match was, was so, uh, close. I don't see it, uh, being an easy match at all. I think, uh, Prudnik's getting strong and at 250 pounds, Michael's given up a lot of weight, right? When he went, he's dropping a lot of weight to come down there. I know that leads that now, but I, the way I saw Prudnik handle Todd Hutchins, I'm leaning towards, uh, Prudnik.
SPEAKER_02: And how do you see it, Hermes? I think it's the same. I put the video on my channel and I repeat. I speak like Gialli. Because I look, I show the match.
SPEAKER_02: with Toda Chin and Prudnik he win very easily very very easily and Michael Todd but maybe Michael have a little chance maybe he can avoid him he can avoid Prudnik move like this maybe he take the risk but
SPEAKER_04: I put 80% approval. 80% approval. Yeah, I understand. Hermes, the guy that you see on the screen, you're going to beat him? If I beat him? Yeah, you will beat him. 98%. 98%, yeah. I think he means 98% chances is odds. What? 9.8.
SPEAKER_04: Very, very funny. Engin, he's having trouble with the translation for the English, right? It's 9.8% chance. I understand, I understand. So, okay, okay, okay. So, Hermes is saying that Jerry has 90.2% chance and Hermes has 9.8% chance. Yeah. Is that true, Hermes?
SPEAKER_02: We see my friend. I'll still buy you a drink after I beat you. I want to look at his face after he shakes my hand and after I start. I want to look at his face after this moment. Coming from the same guy that had trouble with Megan. It's better to call an ambulance near the hotel
SPEAKER_01: thank you you understand what have him bring some tissues to you when you're crying over in the corner you understand you heard me yeah yeah so you want me to you want me to prepare an ambulance near the hotel yeah for him for you no okay but me what because because i'm gonna die laughing
SPEAKER_04: uh he's gonna he's gonna laugh at you he will be laughing and he will be having hospitalized by he's laughing at your like no power yeah now engen isn't this the same guy with matt mask like what's your overall record with matt does matt have more wins
SPEAKER_02: he is saying are you the guy who had the problems with matt mass in wl yeah same level than this time same level so you are at the same level when you lost against me yeah my is good it's good for him to to underestimate me and it's good for him to
SPEAKER_02: to sleep, relax like this. After I will shock him. But it's good for him now for thinking like this. Are you not also underestimating him when you say 2%? No, I don't underestimate him. Oh, you are only saying the facts. Yeah. Okay. I want to go, we go 100%. Maybe it's too much for him.
SPEAKER_04: I think. But I want to win. I want to win. Okay, okay. Hermes, why do you want to look into his eyes? So he will remember? You said that after he feels your power and starts, you said that he wants you to look into your eyes. You want to see his eyes. Why do you want this? Because you want him to remember what he was saying before the event? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: okay okay i understand i understand yeah but i don't know what he wanted to do with me what do you mean i don't understand what what did he want to do with me he said he wanted to cry he said that the first round he smashed him and my top roller is double then
SPEAKER_02: And I came to use the press. I don't know what he wants to do with me. I don't understand. Jerry, understand what he says? I understand this. I would bet a shit ton of money that Gennady would beat him right now. What? He said that he would bet a lot of money that right now Gennady would beat you.
SPEAKER_02: He put the money, then Gennady, he beat me now. Yeah, he said he would bet money that Gennady would win. Super. Nice.
SPEAKER_01: Well, Engen, he's putting Gennady at a lower level. I feel like Gennady came in and was super strong and was really good. And, you know, it was impressive. I don't think that, you know, Ermias, I think Ermias is underestimating Gennady and me. No, no, I don't underestimate nobody. I don't underestimate nobody. You underestimated me now. No, no. I'm just making sure you...
SPEAKER_02: i will show my power i will show what is my technique and i'm at you never you are you you never pulled the like like my style not trevis i pulled a ton of top rollers what what elite presser have you pulled
SPEAKER_04: i've pulled a ton of top rollers right yeah i i i know i don't i never like your style i know i don't understand he is asking you he has pulled all his life against top rollers but what and it's not like with me i understand but what elite level that this pressure
SPEAKER_02: you have pulled in your career like jerry before and never never okay maybe not like jerry huh no no only he he would like this but it's because i don't understand
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I understand. I know. But listen, Jerry, when he says that, you know, you have 2% chances, 98%. Seriously, he's not underestimating you. I don't know why he says that maybe he really believes but he's very serious preparation. He's doing it. He's not like, well, I'm good. You know, I can be Jerry, but he's making all kinds of calculations. He's just very detailed. He's making calculations, right? Yeah. Yeah, I know it. So
SPEAKER_01: And to be clear, I'm not underestimating Hermes either, right? I said, I'm the one that said that I expect it to be a very good match, right? And as long as it becomes a war, the wars always go to me. Yeah, but you said that and then you said that, you know, chance of winning in lottery is, you know, more than beating. Yeah, of course I said that after he said that he has a 98% chance to win.
SPEAKER_04: So your opinion changes according to his attitude. No, I don't care. I'm going to go there.
SPEAKER_01: ready to win i've been doing it more years than he's been alive and i look at it like you know i've done it all right so i'm excited to do it again and uh i you know what i i said a long time ago that i i love the way ermy's pulled i loved his passion i love this you know him person and uh you know i said it a long time ago even when people were all talking about him i said i like them
SPEAKER_02: And I said, I'd love to have a match with him. So either way, you know, to me, it's going to be great because I think he is going to be the future of the sport. I just think it's going to be tough for him on November 19th. I think the first thing is respect to everybody, to the athletes. After this, we know there are
SPEAKER_02: come back to the world like this. We know everybody wants to win. It's normal. But this is the spot. If you think to lose, it's better to stay at home. Or not? Ermes, I have a question for you. You didn't compete at the East vs West Forge.
SPEAKER_04: but you were at the press conference, you were sitting at my left side. And do you remember, do you remember, Gennady said to Jerry, he said, if you are confident, let's say, Jerry was kind of surprised. And at that moment, did you think that Jerry was kind of afraid? Did you think that way?
SPEAKER_02: Tell honestly, I thought that Jerry wasn't confident, but the next day he won. After when Gennady told like this, I remember I showed Jerry like surprised. Yeah. No, if your opponent speak like this,
SPEAKER_04: because he's very confident, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe a little bit for this world, for the... But the other thing is that Gennady just had previous matches against you, against Michael Todd, against Dave Chaffee. He was already warmed up while Jerry was coming after two and a half years break. So he didn't exactly know
SPEAKER_02: where he is he was confident but he was still like let me see you know a lot of people speak a lot of people underestimated him and i think if i fought with him before then after two two years and a half maybe uh i you would underestimate him
SPEAKER_04: More than now. Not now. I understand. Not like Gennady, but a little less. You are saying that if you didn't see that match and if you knew that Jerry was coming, his first match was against you, you wouldn't be prepared as seriously as you are now. You would just think that maybe it's enough. Not too much.
SPEAKER_02: because i done a mistake one year ago with with kurdeca and this is good lesson for me now and i know now i'm a heavy heavier than 10 kilo more than last year but now like a
SPEAKER_02: this year like when i fought with arifa 10 i i i remember now i want to go every time i want to do my best 100 because when i have done a mistake i don't want to repeat this yeah yeah yeah because once you make a mistake and you lose it is hard to clean the reputation
SPEAKER_02: yeah because when you know you don't do your best is very if you now if i go with that i know i want to do my best good training everything 100 and if i lose i know i i i now i do my best you understand
SPEAKER_02: And I'm happy. But if you don't do your best shape, it's not very good for your mind. I understand. And before the press conference, will you ask Jerry, the winner takes all? Me with him?
SPEAKER_04: no maybe he wanted to with me i don't know but you are not going to offer such thing right no need no no need to ask no no no neither why now you are saying that the guy lost and let him make some money as well right yeah yeah there are preparation everything is good all the people take
SPEAKER_01: he's popped get it is it are you provocated enough am i what provocated enough oh it's fine right yeah it's funny you know that when gennady had said that to me yeah you know it was i was taken back because i was thinking wait you well as you know right i you know
SPEAKER_01: Whatever, we won't talk about it, but that's fine. Because it is what it is, right? It's going to be good. I kind of think it's unnecessary. What's that, Hermes? Show me your forehead, Jerry. Too small, my friend. You see, this is all you need to worry about.
SPEAKER_01: Where's your muscle? Let me see your muscle. My muscle. Yeah. You got to put it more into that . Use more, my friend. There's more. What do you think, Angie? What do you think, Angie?
SPEAKER_04: ms looks incredibly strong he's gonna destroy you or not my friend i mean you you bring your elbow to the camera like this he's like look at look how big look how big just using my phone your your your your tricep looks so skinny the bicep tricep
SPEAKER_04: But I use my tricep only for the end fight, only for the end position. Yeah, and he's beneath the bicep or the tricep because when his arm goes... I don't know. I think Jadon looks more scary. His arms look... Maybe not. I mean, yeah. Because now he's more...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, not bad, not bad. Let's see. What's that? Was that just putting it up or was that actually him trying to make a muscle? I don't understand. I'm kidding. I'm saying what you said. Translate Engin. Translate. Everyone is on the phone saying that Engin is translating from English to English. Engin is translating from a native English speaker
SPEAKER_04: to like a foreign English speaker. So I'm in between. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Jerry looks very, we are going to finish soon. Jerry looks very, I don't know, dangerous. And I don't know. Let's see. Let's see, Ermes. You really need to make a perfect job, Ermes, to win that match. Any mistake, maybe problem.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I don't know how strong you are. Every time I talk with you and one time I said, who do you want to pull just in case if you lose? And you said, there is no possibility like that. Remember? And you, you, you, you refuse to answer, you know, and when to pull, who to pull. And you said that there is, you said that in the shape that I am in engine, he said, there is no possibility that I lose.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Do you think, Hermes, do you think that the way that you answer is very objective or do you think it is all from Hermes' perspective? These are for my perspective or? No, no, no. You think you are objective when you say that it is impossible to lose. Is it because you yourself is talking like, you know, I'm good, you know, nobody can beat me? Or is it like well calculated?
SPEAKER_02: Thinking, thinking, and thinking, okay, no way. Is it with the mind you're talking or with the heart you're talking? Both, because my character is a victory character, you understand? I think like this because I feel good now.
SPEAKER_04: very good and people are asking what's your biceps oh what my size your bicep size they are asking 53 but warm without a pound or cold 53 and in yours jerry i don't know
SPEAKER_01: 65, you see? Yeah. I don't know how to convert it into centimeters. Do you know in inches? Yeah, like probably 21 and a half. 21 and a half or three, it's about 55 centimeters, I think. 55 centimeters. But his is more fat, right, Hermes, than yours? Yeah. Oh, that's why. We already get the picture of the fat, and Hermes was fatter.
SPEAKER_04: was that we already did the picture to show fat and hermes had more fat oh you were just talking about the the stomach muscle right yeah yeah hermes looks like you had a little bit more fat than jerry had i agree are you are you serious my friend i don't know i i don't know
SPEAKER_04: one second one second do a poll and ask them i will make a poll yes you will show again who is this stomach one second one second one second jerry's air misses only five minutes i will keep this
SPEAKER_02: and then and then show again and show again no no he's afraid i eat a lot of sushi but look here my friend show you everything show everything i know look at the chest very fat look me oh it's muscle muscle not fat right jerry
SPEAKER_04: We were trying to establish who's fatter. Where's he going? Is he going to do some fucking sit-ups or something? He's fat. Just say up. We cannot see your fat belly. Okay. Ermes, so far you will not like the results. People said 54% Ermes' belly is fatter. This is what he says.
SPEAKER_04: just look at the love handles he's got those big love candles on the side and imagine jerry how old are you uh i am uh almost 50. almost 50 and look at you are even more ripped than hermes and he's not not even 30. what excuse do you have i know his excuse his excuse is spaghetti and pasta
SPEAKER_04: Ah, this is a problem. The question is, whose stomach is better? Jerry, 46%. Hermes, 54%. People think your stomach is better. OK, my friend.
SPEAKER_02: This is only your victory for this. I give you only this victory for you. Another thing is for me. Okay. So you give him this victory? This 50 years old man? He's a good man. He's funny like this. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So.

SPEAKER_04: okay just it's not a bad thing it's not a bad thing you know okay thank you anyways so i thank you guys very very much and it was fun it was some little bit intense and sometimes fun on the november 19th we will talk about every rule everything before the event we will put on the camera film it most likely pull on this put on the social media and then we will arm ourselves
SPEAKER_02: and then hopefully not to hopefully for sure the better one will be and then shake hands and then everyone else because i don't want to repeat because he speak for his spouse to understand it's better to to do agreement with us no jerry
SPEAKER_04: And after these, there are no problem for nobody. Yeah, I'm telling you guys both. I don't want to win on a foul and I don't want to lose on a foul, right? But I will tell you guys, the pads will be 8x8, 20-something, 20, for every East versus West from now on. What was the last one? But even this much. What was the last? Listen, if this match, it was 7x7.
SPEAKER_04: um but this one like even this much out from front side back foul as soon as we see it's foul don't no no excuse not for ms not for you your elbow will not go out from the front ms's elbow will not go from back anything we will call it just i'm telling all year already so
SPEAKER_04: no excuse from no side i'm not pointing you or you or something because i get so much after that all i care the better arm master to win in a fair and square match i don't want this i will talk with the referees your match is very important match the most important match of 2000 um after the devon levan finish it was very hype match but it wasn't so competitive in actual arm wrestling but this
SPEAKER_04: is possibility that it will be a tough match. And so we all will poke sit down and then there will be no. So would you do add one inch to the back? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. One something from front and one something from back. Adam S will have one something more to pull his elbow back. And then you will have one something more to bring your elbow from front. So you will have more place.
SPEAKER_04: from both front and both back for top roller is good for you is also good both but the only reason now you have one more something but if you even like half half millimeter gets out it's foul i'm not gonna say because everyone is saying oh his elbow was out mine was out this was out and i will try to make sure that there will be camera too so that's very important match so you both will get
SPEAKER_04: what you deserve, and I will talk with the referees to be very strict. Please listen to referees for both sides. Ready? Go. And then let the better one win, you know. Okay. Yeah, because I have nothing to do. RMS wins, you win, nothing to do. I mean, for me, you both are incredible athletes, and whoever wins or loses, I have utmost respect. I only care that I don't get a headache after the event, so that is all I care, you know.
SPEAKER_04: So make your plans that, you know, every little bit is a foul. There will be no excuse. And to me, the best referee in the world is Christo Delijako. He's an incredible referee. Most likely he will ref. We will put a side ref too. We will talk. You, I, Hermes, we will talk. And then everything, however we talk, will be applied at the table, you know. Whatever thing you want to say, whatever you want to, I mean, talk,
SPEAKER_04: just say that and then let's just go and pull because after the event people talk a lot and then i try to do my best and then people give so i don't want to hear that because i do my best to promote the event anyways guys i mean i have huge respect for you guys and again i'm repeating to everyone right now 448 people are watching it was up to 500 and
SPEAKER_04: This is the most important armwrestling match on the earth right now. Because right now everyone agrees that Levan Saginashvili is the best, strongest puller on the earth. Most likely he is the strongest armwrestler in the history. And what I hear that winner of this match will face Levan. The whole world is thinking who is gonna face Levan. So this is the match, this is the most important match
SPEAKER_04: Also, this is the world title match for the East versus West organization. So you guys are great. This is the main event. And I wish you guys the best. And I thank you very, very much for being part of it. Do you guys have anything to say? The last word. Hermes, do you want to say anything to Jerry? I hope Jerry, he training without injury. This
SPEAKER_02: in the last part of, before the event. And I hope he do his best and I give my best. He are stronger who will win. Finish. And Jerry, if you have anything. Before you say something, Jerry, Jerry, people thought that your belly is better, 52%.
SPEAKER_02: You will never win, my friend, with me. You lose no chance with every joke, every play. So, you said that he's going to win now and you will win in the East versus West. So, does it apply the same way? Now you win and he's going to win? No, no. If he loses with these... Both of them? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, uh, no, I'm excited to go against armies in a, to match. I've wanted them for a while.
SPEAKER_01: I've watched him progress. I think that he's awesome. And I am anxious to go because I want to feel how strong he is. And I love the excitement that he brings to the table. So I'm looking forward to this match. I don't think it's going to be easy for either one of us. So I think if he thinks it's going to be easy, he's underestimating it. But I think that I'm going to be prepared for war.
SPEAKER_04: and uh you know i'm just either way i respect them so i uh thank you thank you guys thank you and the the only thing that i want to add you know because you say something and that something comes to my mind that hermes he said that you should not expect a easy match i have a question for hermes if naturally if this match is a hard match you still think that you can win if if not
SPEAKER_02: If there are hard matches. Yeah, I mean, if he stops you, you couldn't go and then the match is long. I think if I go too much down with my arm and I wait like Gennady, it's very, very hard. But in the centre? In the centre, for me, my mind,
SPEAKER_02: it's difficult to match that are stopped in the center. On this way or another way. It's difficult to stop these maybe two, three seconds in the
SPEAKER_02: in the first part of the match. So, you are saying that he was... Or me, I take my position or he takes his position. Okay, I understand, I understand. So, you are saying that if the match starts, either you're going to take the advantage or he's going to take the advantage. Yeah. Okay, I understand, I understand.
SPEAKER_04: And Jerry, do you think that if matches just say like 10 seconds, it's stopped, fresh match, he still has chance to win or his chance is very low? Depends on where it stops, Sengen, right? Can you explain quickly before we stop? You can review the million matches that I've done and never got taken from a top role and pinned quick, ever. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_04: I understand. I understand. Anyway, so you just said something, so it just opened another question in my mind. So that's what I want to say. Thank you very, very much, guys. And just prepare very well. And hope to see you guys in Istanbul. Hopefully, we will have a good time. And at the end, everyone will deserve what they get. Sounds good. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Take care, guys. Thank you. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
SPEAKER_04: Thanks to everyone who watch us and you all take care. Hope to see you next time, my friend.
