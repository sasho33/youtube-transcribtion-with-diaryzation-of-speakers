SPEAKER_03: Hello, guys. My guest will come very soon to start. We are starting
SPEAKER_03: about 30 minutes earlier. Okay, let's see who are here.
SPEAKER_03: Hello, my friends. Hello. Good afternoon. Thank you. I'm tired. My brain hurts, you know. Hello, Mr. Teresa, how the recovery goes? I really don't know. I really don't have any time to go to gym and train and
SPEAKER_03: While I'm waiting like this, I don't understand. I really need to train and see like how much I can force. Easy does. Hello to the legend. That is Engin. Thank you, my friend. It's your kindness. Michael's workspace. Hello, Engin from Texas. Thank you. Hello, my friend. Hello to Texas. Hello, Engin. How are you? Tired, my friend, very tired.
SPEAKER_03: every day doing live and just doing a lot of things. And soon, my guests will join me in Douglas and Justin Bishop, it will be interesting. Two interesting personalities. Let's see how it will be.
SPEAKER_03: Hello from Macedonia. Hello to Macedonia. Hello. Hello, my friends. You must be very tired. You have been pulling this week. Since Thursday. Hello. Hello, my friends.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's see. Justin Bishop came. How am I feeling? I feel exhausted, my friend. Very, very exhausted, but it was workplace. Britney's new song was hilarious. Yep. I'm sure he will do more. See you. Hello, my friend. Yeah, two interesting personalities.
SPEAKER_03: In December 17, I will have a one-night service. I will try to master you best.
SPEAKER_03: Like yesterday at university, I was watching East versus West video during break, and one of my co-students seemed very curious about it and asked me some questions. It's nice. Hello, Justin. How are you, my friend? I'm all right, brother. How are you? Fine. I think who's coming there? I think Mindagos also came. Hello, Mindagos. Can you turn the phone sideways, if you can? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I can't see you. So how have you been, Justin? I'm pretty good, bro. Just got done eating some lunch. It's Friday, so I don't have to work all day. So it's a good day. Yeah. And so you told me that your right arm after a long break felt good and you decided to compete. Where are you?
SPEAKER_00: uh now and where will you be in 15 days about shape i feel good as far as uh you know pain goes uh my numbers are looking pretty good uh i feel i'm i'm a little bit sore in my bicep from my last you know heavy heavy uh day in the gym so i'll do some light stuff between now and then and i'll you know i'll back it off a couple days out focus more on
SPEAKER_00: uh making sure i'm healthy for the weight but i don't i don't have a lot to lose so i'm not too worried about it what do you mean you have not lost blood but a lot to lose what do you mean oh my weight i was saying the last couple of days i won't i'll probably usually i work out all the way to about three days out you know real light stuff nothing heavy uh but i'll probably stop four or five days out this time so i got a little more time to focus on uh
SPEAKER_03: know losing the weight what's your weight are you like about one about eight yeah about 86 87 right now so you have about like six seven pounds to lose yeah okay and then and then you're gonna come and kick this uh lithuanian's ass yeah that's the plan i don't i don't think
SPEAKER_03: I don't think he's quite big enough. Yeah, I mean, he doesn't even feel any shame to show us those skinny arms, you know, just I don't understand. I mean, you would think that, you know, oh, can I beat him? And then once you see arms, you would say, oh, OK, OK, not a big deal. No shoulder. I don't know where his shoulder is. Justin would have to be too big.
SPEAKER_03: What's that, Mindago? Sorry. I don't really have to be that big, you know. I'm using my frame. You know, normally the guys who have a smaller frame, they look a bit more muscular. To me, I'm using my joints and tendons. That's where power comes from. And that will be enough to beat Justin? I think it should be enough, yeah. I faced a couple of these bigger guys this year already. And I did really well in the Supermatch format.
SPEAKER_03: just and just stylistically doesn't seem to be too dangerous to me of course the only thing which could be dangerous is his just power because he might just be better than me at the same thing because we are i would consider us being very similar um he might just be better in the same aspect but i really doubt it i really don't yeah how do you how do you see your chances yes go ahead question
SPEAKER_00: I was just going to say there's one way to find out, though. But I take into consideration every match you've seen me in the last four or five years has been with somebody who outweighs you about 20 kilos. Yeah, but you are from the United States, you know, so it's different. You know what that means, Justin. I know what it means.
SPEAKER_03: Listen, it's North America versus the world. I've accepted that. It's what it is. Yeah, it's not East versus West. It is basically United States versus the world. And sometimes Canadians, like this event that we have two of them, they get involved, two strong ones. And in Mindagas, I saw Justin competed at Moldova.
SPEAKER_03: there he lost against Iraq Lee, but in the same event, he beat we are as Dobri. Who won the WAF was last year. And this year, it took second to Bojidar. And Bojidar just moved up to 85. If Bojidar would stay at 80. He was champion we are at this year as well, you know, of course, we cannot judge that way. But I mean, we are is a top roller. And like, does it not concern you at all? Or?
SPEAKER_03: Well, of course, winning against Viral is a pretty good thing, pretty good achievement. But I think Viral at that time was not as great as he is now. And also, I think being a strong, like posting top role, having a strong posting top role is somehow very, works well against Viral. But again, it didn't really work that well against Irakli, right?
SPEAKER_03: And I think, I don't remember what it was. Didn't I win that event on the right arm? What's that? Didn't I win that same Moldova event on the right arm? Yeah, yeah, yeah. After Emil and Daniel killed each other. Yeah. How long was it? Five minutes, Naples, maybe?
SPEAKER_03: Like many starts, many... You remember, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you play a super match with him. He won 3-0. I think three months later, but you gave him a hell. You were incredible. I mean, even one of the matches, you hit him like more than 30 times. I mean, yeah, you are very dangerous too. But I mean, what's your country name, a guy's name, the 80-kilo puller? Say it again, sorry. The guy from your country, the 80-kilo puller.
SPEAKER_03: uh monarca yeah yeah i kind of find similarity between his pool and justin's you know the style i kind of feel that you know he's also posting type of top role and then i remember he's beating you so like does it not concern you like when somebody is very solid back pressure no for sure it does concern me because
SPEAKER_03: It's one of the worst feelings when you lose your wrist and there's not much you can do afterwards. But even in that nightmare scenario, I think that now I still have my much better flop wrist press. You know, the one which I used to beat you, Engin. And also I beat the Armenian. You mean...
SPEAKER_03: not the match that i beat you 10-0 right right and left no not that one not that one no that are you talking about the one down to 143 and the more important one yeah and then when the first it was a pin okay okay i understand that one yeah
SPEAKER_03: But also when I look at my match with the Armenian guy just a couple of weeks ago. It was impressive. It was incredible, yeah. And I felt really very, very well as soon as I transitioned. You know, I was really, I was tired. I couldn't cup properly. But then as soon as I let it go, it felt very solid. So this worst case scenario, I think I still have another weapon to use. And then you will beat him with a dead wrist, you are saying?
SPEAKER_03: yeah but then you pull after you and daniel killed each other exactly so i i felt like i was damaged a little bit can i ask you something after i was right there when you top rolled daniel and then eventually when he beat you
SPEAKER_03: Did you let it go because, like, you could make it 30 seconds longer, but it was going to make you even more tired for the rest of the event? Like, could you make it, like, a little bit longer if you wanted? Because it seemed like you're like, oh, okay. I could make it a bit longer, but I felt like, okay, it's too much. It's not great. I would lose way too much if I kept going. Okay, okay. And then after that match, you pulled with the Armenian. I think he was second place at the Europeans. And he took your wrist and you still beat him like this. I was like, wow.
SPEAKER_03: So I made many stupid mistakes during that tournament, but I still felt like overall I felt good. I felt like it was fun to fight. Next time I'll try to avoid the mistakes and it should be better. I was in such an event with such participants. We already talked before. I talked with Daniel too.
SPEAKER_03: a bad draw can mess everything. You can be one-on-one the best guy there, but with a bad draw, you could end up in place there. Well, that is what happened to you. What did you take six or what? Yeah, 16. And you gave the hardest match to the Daniel there. And I, I am sure that you really messed up his plans for the rest of the event. Yeah. So Justin,
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about all this? That your Moldova event and your Austin type of thing and Minda was saying he can probably beat you with a dead wrist. How do you see all this? I don't. I'm pretty sure he can't beat me without his hand. So you may as well lay it down. If I take your hand, you may as well lose, you know, just lay the mask down, try again. Because I can't remember the last time I've lost when I've taken the person's hand.
SPEAKER_03: so the guy needs to be heavier right he needs to be much heavier right justin you know i mean someone to beat you with a dead wrist the guy needs to be heavyweight guy or something with a big big big mask behind it the pressure yeah any guy like this i mean i don't think that there is yeah you don't have enough arm your joints not going to help you when you're stretched out with no hand
SPEAKER_00: To me, it just shows Justin's inexperience. He doesn't really realize how much more efficient this thing could be against his style. No, it's definitely efficient. I'm just saying you're too small. You need to be a little bigger. How tall are you, Justin? Taller than you. No, I'm about six foot. I wear my boots, 6'1".
SPEAKER_00: Okay, you might be taller than me. We might be similar. Yeah, he's about three centimeters taller than you. Maybe one. I don't, yeah, I noticed, you know, you're, I don't know. I think you're going to learn that some of the things you're assuming about me or about things I can or can't do are flawed. But you'll learn, you know, same way.
SPEAKER_03: I learn and everybody else learns. Because I plan on not just beating you, top rolling you. I'm going to beat you in a hook too. Since you said I can't hook. I'm going to beat you both places. No, I think it's going to be a match about power a lot. Because I'm saying that Justin is comfortable to me. But at the same time, I understand that I'm comfortable to Justin. So it's...
SPEAKER_00: I think it's not about tricks this time. It's really about power. I'm very curious. I'm very curious. I think, I think, you know, a lot's going to be determined on, uh, you know, which way the, uh, you know, you decide to go as to which way I decided to go. And, you know, I think it's going to be more of a chess match, but it's definitely going to be who's stronger, where, you know, all of that. Uh, I was talking to, I think it was Artem and, uh,
SPEAKER_00: I told him personally, I thought this was a little more difficult match for me than if I say I pulled Daniel. Because with Daniel, you know what to expect, you know? Like with me, most people think they know what to expect with me until they arm wrestle me. And then they're like, oh, I thought you was going to do this. And it felt like you were going to do this, but that's not what happened. So, you know, like when I watch Mindy pull, he's got a good solid low hand.
SPEAKER_00: I think that's his money move. It's like not super committed low hand top row, but not posting top row. You know, it's kind of in between. And the thing about that move is you don't really know which direction I'm going, you know. But with him, nine out of ten times, he goes the same direction. So I don't really have to worry. But, you know, that move, you can disguise different things you're doing.
SPEAKER_00: So it's a harder move to read versus, say, somebody like Daniel, who you know they're going inside. Whether it be just coming across to get you or whether he's going sideways to get more shoulder in his offense. But you know for sure he's coming inside. But I think Mendoza is where he's at because he's smart on the table.
SPEAKER_03: And he's a good arm wrestler, so got to give him that. I just don't think he's quite big enough, but we'll see shortly. Yeah. Justin, can you do any low hand? You must, you haven't been doing your homework? Because I can, I just always see you posting hard. I haven't seen you low hand enough. I don't know. Let me shoot you some videos.
SPEAKER_03: I've seen all your matches. I'm a fanboy now. I've seen all your matches. You haven't seen all mine yet? Yeah, probably not all of them. They're out there. No, I think I have seen enough. I think you can do a little bit, but I never see you fully commit into his low hand somehow. And if you cannot do it, then it's good for me. Which move do you want to get beat with first? Hook.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, you going there with me or are you going to try to go out? I'm going in with you. I'm going in with you. Okay. Okay. We'll go there first. We'll just go there first. Get it out of the way, you know? Yeah. Why not? Yeah, just talk right before the event again, so then there will not be any misunderstanding. Oh, you told me this, but you didn't do this. So, I mean, you go or not, you know, you don't need to commit anything because there's armistice.
SPEAKER_00: But, Justin, don't you find it interesting that Indiagos already started to talk about this? Yeah, he's scared, bro. Look, I see right through that. I can't tell you how many times I flew to a guy's home state, arm wrestled in his backyard, and all barking the whole time leading up to the event.
SPEAKER_00: And I get there and there's no bar, you know, there's no bar until ready to go. And, you know, and then a lot of times you see that real fear come out in their eyes, but every now and then you run up on a guy who's actually as good as he's talking. And then it's a good match and you talk about it for years to come, but I don't know if you're that guy, you know, I see you talk. I've watched your last couple of matches. You like to, you know, have that conversation during the match.
SPEAKER_03: when you're winning, but when you're losing, you don't talk so much. The confidence kind of drops. That's when you've got to be the most confident. So, Justin, look, the event is going to be amazing, right? Like so many big stars are coming. Your team from U.S. is just amazing, Devon, Brzenk, and everyone else.
SPEAKER_00: How do you feel about, you know, maybe they will do well. Meanwhile, you are just going to be like minus one for Team US. Must be a bad feeling. Yeah, you know, it would suck if it turned out that way, wouldn't it? I mean, so you got the whole country riding on your back though, right? There's not another Lithuanian coming? No, no, I'm the only one. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Falls to the wall and you gotta take it home. Justin, I have a question for you. Have you seen Corey Miller's match with Dania Prokopchuk? I did. What do you think about the match? You know, I've been arm wrestling for. Like around 12 years. And I've still I pulled Corey once left handed in the first.
SPEAKER_00: I think it was the second year I had been arm wrestling, and I've yet to pull him again. I've pulled many people that have pulled both of us. I thought personally it was a bad stylistic matchup for him. I think Corey's an awesome arm wrestler, but at the end of the day, he's got one move, not many adjustments, and if he can't,
SPEAKER_00: If you can get any kind of good defensive spot on him, you're pretty much going to milk him and beat him. I thought it was a bad stylistic matchup for him. And I thought personally he could have swapped names. I don't think he swapped one thing. I think he got beat. Did they pull all five? Was it five matches or three? Whatever it was, he never swapped anything that I seen. He could have swapped some small stuff that you can't see.
SPEAKER_00: but I thought technically he did a poor job. He's one of many, actually, that are counting me out in this match that's from my own country. So I don't feel bad saying that, but he kind of, I don't know, he didn't look good in that one, you know? And either that's just a bad stylistic matchup or Daniel is really that good. And I think it's a little of both.
SPEAKER_03: Normally, Daniel is a hook puller, but with him, he went outside and even took his wrist and everything, you know. So what I just tried to say that, did you see, did you find that match like dominance from Daniel's side? Yeah, for sure. I mean, if Daniel, if you don't, you don't take out your secondary move unless two things happen.
SPEAKER_00: or one of two things, unless you're ace and the whole move doesn't work, or you feel comfortable enough you don't even need that move. Either way, it doesn't look good on Corey, right? Either way, it looks dominant performance on Daniel's behalf. So I don't think Daniel... What I wanted to ask you is that whenever I have seen Daniel trying to top roll Mendoza only once,
SPEAKER_03: It was last year at European Championships and Mindaugas almost flash pinned him. Because normally Daniel tries inside and Mindaugas takes his wrist, they have a war, war. So Prokopchuk is trying to improve his outside skill. And he was, I invited them to top eight 78 kilo event last year, two times in March and in April.
SPEAKER_03: So after the event, after the second event, after pull, he pulled with Mindaugas and he was top rolling him. Probably he thought that he can do it. So in the event he tried and Mindaugas just beat him, but Prokopchuk was lucky that he got a foul. So the second start, he tried hook again. So what I just tried to say that, that Daniel's performance, outside performance against Corey,
SPEAKER_03: And then when Daniel tries to go outside with Mindaugas, Mindaugas comfortably beats him. Does it give you any idea that this guy looks very skinny, but maybe generating much more than how he looks, you know? Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Well, listen, I've always been the skinny small guy, right? So this is the, that's usually what I, I don't, I don't underestimate him, but you know, by any means you don't beat the caliber of guys he's beaten without being a good, strong, fundamental arm wrestler, you know? Um, but I've also, I think the advantages that I didn't have the last three or four years of arm wrestling, I'm going to have in this match.
SPEAKER_00: which is why I'm not as worried about certain things that I normally would be worried about pulling in, you know, a 200-pound class. And I understand these aren't European arm wrestlers that I'm arm wrestling at 200 pounds, but many of them have done well against other European arm wrestlers.
SPEAKER_00: you know, I don't do it just against the middleweight arm wrestlers. I do it against super heavyweights as he does. I've seen him, you know, especially in his home country. They, you know, the smaller events they're running through a lot of people. You don't do that unless you're strong and fundamentally sound. And you can tell he uses his leverage. Well, he uses his length. Well, um,
SPEAKER_00: I'm expecting a good match. What I'm hoping for is I just smash him and go home. That's what I'm hoping for. But I'm expecting a war, you know, that I come out victorious in. But no, I mean, I've diagnosed all of his matches that I've seen on YouTube. There's two, I would say there's two things he does really well. Everything else is kind of middle of the pack. And
SPEAKER_00: You only need to do one thing really well to win, but can you make that move happen? I think he's got a plan B type of top role. But you don't see him hooking everybody for a reason, right? And it's not necessarily because he can't hook, because he don't want to hook. Same reason you don't see me hooking. Yeah, he's becoming very well-rounded. I have seen him try and hook.
SPEAKER_03: very well, I have seen him doing that deadlifts. His top roll is just like nine and a half out of 10, you know, in my opinion. And Minda goes, sorry for not giving you enough time. I want him to talk and give you some ideas. And then I want to ask you, like, what are you thinking about all this? Yeah, same.
SPEAKER_03: Do you mean the same like Corey thing comparison or what do you mean exactly? No, no, no, no, no. Like what did you think about all these things that we are talking? Do you have anything to say? Yeah, it was interesting. Justin's opinion about Corey, like clearly it didn't look good for Corey, but and I agree with the matchup was
SPEAKER_03: stylistically probably difficult for corey because if he is not able to flash pin people most likely he doesn't have that high-end power and then daniel was good enough to stop him and then it looks pretty bad um and you never know maybe it was pretty close um if you if you just had a bit more um explosive power sometimes it might work but um
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, otherwise, Justin seems to be a good opponent. It's going to be interesting. I want to ask you, when you beat Giannis, the once, I think, right, at the wild event that you won, am I correct? Yeah, right-handed, yeah. Yeah, and my question is, that was 165 pounds category? Yes, sir.
SPEAKER_03: So it was 165, and then the weight limit right now is 180. Like, what is the difference when you are 165 and 180? Like, how much difference, like, in your honest opinion, you know, like, does it make so much difference for you? Because you are probably a tall guy, you know, not like 6'3". Yeah. I mean, 165, I probably was...
SPEAKER_00: the top three biggest guy over here at that weight, as far as, you know, heights and overall stature. So it was the one, the time I pulled Giannis and made that weight, I was walking around about 180. And now I walk around about four or five kilos. Yeah. About four or five kilos heavier. So it's definitely a difference, you know, in my older age, uh, I mean, that was almost 10 years ago. So, you know, I'm in my thirties now. I can't.
SPEAKER_00: I'm just naturally a little bit bigger, you know, than I was. So if I went to 65, I would need, you know, four or five months. And I don't know that I would want to do that because I've cut weight so many times for events like that in the past that I think it may have done damage to my body that I don't, you know. That's not exactly what I am asking. What I am asking, how much stronger you are compared to your 165? I believe I'm.
SPEAKER_00: I think I'm definitely stronger, uh, definitely smarter because I had, I've been the same table IQ on that day. It wouldn't even have been a match the second time. Uh, you know, but Giannis being Giannis, especially, I think Giannis was on the, at the top of the mountain at that time. Pretty sure he won WAF like a couple of months before or after that. When did you pull him? The first time I pulled him, it was 2013.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, and then next? 15. Okay, you beat him in 2015? I beat him once. No, you beat him in 2015? Now, he ultimately ended up winning first and I won second. But I beat him left-handed in 2015. Okay, in 2013 he beat you? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I beat him right-handed. Then he beat me in the finals. Well, I say he did. Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I understand. So you are saying that you are saying that you are now stronger shape than when you face Giannis. Yeah. I mean, I was in great shape then. That was probably one of my best forms because I was, uh, I had a lot less going on in my life. You know what I mean? I had two less, two less kids. Yeah. But, uh,
SPEAKER_00: As far as preparation goes, that was one of my top five events that I prepped for the best. But as far as overall strength, overall arm wrestling, I'm a better arm wrestler now. Stronger and especially inside. If I knew anything about what I know about pulling inside now, I'd have beat him in a hook that day. Because he basically just held on until I drained out. Then I was no good.
SPEAKER_00: and uh but you know i was strong my top row was so much better than his that day and then uh every time after that i pulled him for some reason i tried to contain his top roll and go sideways instead of just top rolling myself and i get i get caught chasing him you know what i mean
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. It sounds like Justin didn't really get stronger since when. That's what it sounds to me, like somehow. You got to hope not. I feel like I got so much stronger since a couple of years ago. So that also gives me confidence, you know, a couple extra kilos. And what's your weight right now?
SPEAKER_03: Mine? Uh, 75 kilo just, but I'm, I'm cooking pancakes now. So maybe a couple more. Okay. So you will be about 165, 167 pounds 68. Yeah. Like this. Yeah. I don't know. I think, I think it will be very hard day for you. Could be. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, yeah, I think, I think, yeah. Um, let's see. I mean, you both.
SPEAKER_03: Let me just tell you, sometimes I find it difficult to come in in a proper shape. For example, sometimes I just feel a bit weak, maybe didn't eat enough calories during the past couple of days, something like that. But if I do show up and everything works, then Justin has no chance, zero chance. I just have to make sure that everything works. My best shape will always be Justin.
SPEAKER_03: Listen, that didn't sound good. So if you lose, you're going to say, I'm not in good shape. And if you win, you're going to say, did I not tell you? I mean, come on. Exactly what he just said. No, no, no. Tell me, are you in your best shape or not?
SPEAKER_03: My job is to come in at my best shape. If I fail to do that, of course, it's not an excuse. But I'm just saying that in my mind, to myself, I'm thinking, come on, let's be ready for Justin. Let's go 100%. So I'm just constantly reminding myself, let's not take it easy. And I will make sure to eat a lot of calories before this match. Okay, because it sounded like
SPEAKER_03: if I am in my best shape, he has no chance. And then it means that if I lose, so it means that I'm not in my best shape, you know? I mean, yeah. So it just felt like, you know, like, you know, some point or something, but it's still a sport, you know, it's a difficult thing. You can never be 100% sure. But, um, I mean, I mean, you can be at your best shape. Someone still can beat you. Not Justin.
SPEAKER_00: I tell my guys, I see, you know, the difference between an excuse and a reason is there's not one. You're both, you still lost either way, but that's what it sounded like to me. Cause you already coming up with excuses. That's all right, though, baby. I'm, I'm, I see it all the time, especially when you pull the bigger guys like I do. They always, you know, they don't ever want to pull you cause they're not supposed to get beat. And then they always, you know,
SPEAKER_03: As soon as you see him, how was the flight? Oh, it was terrible, man. You know, I was cutting weight and, you know, they lost my luggage and blah, blah. Anyway. Yeah. And then he will probably say that he was heavier than me. I mean, you shouldn't accept the match. Okay. No, no excuses. No excuses. Okay. Okay. Now, now good. Thomas. Thank you for your super chat.
SPEAKER_03: Hello everyone, are we already able to donate in order to receive armless in table cover signed by atlas very soon, I will announce it very soon, my friend. It is a kind of costing more than what I was thinking, but soon I will get the prize and then I will, I will decide if we can or not. Oh, my screen looks again, thank you for your spreadsheet I missed the T shirt, so I need to get the cover.
SPEAKER_03: uh yeah we will come with some ideas so i don't know if poster is what poster will be what broken on the road maybe sheep i don't know anyway so let's see i am i don't know very very uh two two two two guys different different personalities one is easy going looking easy but did you see his video that he made for you
SPEAKER_03: that he's saying you know you are like a good family guy and this and this and then you will lose like something yeah yeah yeah i've seen that it's like one foot in and one foot out you know what i mean just commit one way or the other you know i know it's hard what do you mean oh
SPEAKER_03: I commit to being playing the villain or commit to being a nice guy. You know, I was, you know, I was simply committed to being realistic, you know. Oh, I got you. Yeah, yeah. You know, he respects you. He's playing mind games, you know. He prepares your mind. Oh, what a respectful guy. What a nice guy. And then, you know, it's a shock to us.
SPEAKER_03: Chuck, like the way that Prudnik did to Devon, you know, when he said that, you know, like he wishes the best to that family. And did you see his video? Yeah. He will end up with a lightweight. Hey, Justin, how do you see the team West? I mean, I like our chances. We got some good matches, you know what I mean? Like, oh.
SPEAKER_00: And the guys we have on there that you know everybody's got holes in the game, but I think some of the guys we have on there that holds that they did have the fiction like for myself. I can say that Dave, you know one of his downfalls was his gas tank. He seemed to have fixed it. You know, Devon seems to be healed. John is John. I mean, I don't think he has any holes other than getting old.
SPEAKER_00: I like our chances, man. I think Adam, this is going to be a big chance for Adam. I think, you know, I've pulled with Adam before. He seems, he reminds me a lot of Devin, the way he can get stronger as the match goes. Yeah, yeah. His endurance, right? His endurance is very good, right? Yeah, yeah. And, you know, that's probably one of the matches I'm looking forward to seeing because I wanted to pull Bozidar
SPEAKER_00: last year i think it was a year before at armors and uh we set it up and everything but covert pretty much made it where it wouldn't happen so i was interested uh i think tony ended up going to pull him instead of me uh no they they pull through here you know in my event east versus west okay yeah yeah yeah they went long before that um okay yeah but uh one question for you they they're asking
SPEAKER_00: What does it mean to you to bring the victory to USA? Is it important for you? Oh yeah. That's, that's, you know, that's one of the top on my list because of, uh, right now. Yeah. For representing my country and bringing back to victory would mean a lot because, um, we haven't been doing that great, especially in, you know, in the sub
SPEAKER_00: heavyweights, you know, the lighter weights, um, and, you know, just to bring up lightweight arm wrestling back where, you know, it used to be, uh, I can remember actually we, there wasn't an American ranked in 2013 until I beat Giannis and, and kind of put that back. We was back on there. I think I was number five. I think it was, was, were you doing the rankings then?
SPEAKER_00: I don't remember. Yeah, but I ended up being number five and then Giannis was up there one or two or something like that. But, you know, after that, we kind of, you know, because of the WAL stuff, we had Europeans coming over here and, you know, and then our guys going over there. So we got a couple of guys back on the list, but I don't I haven't looked in a while, but I don't think we're on the list.
SPEAKER_03: anymore you consider yourself as a patriotic person like like like a what kind of person like patriots oh patriotic yeah yeah i would definitely say i'm a patriotic person i mean if you don't appreciate the country you live in i don't see how you're going to appreciate anybody else's country yeah yeah i'm almost the same way when i compete but when i organize i need to be objective
SPEAKER_03: But when I'm competing, I'm the same way. So it is very, very important for you to, you know, be the skinny guy and then bring you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you, Minerva, do your nationalistic feelings strong for your country, Lithuania?
SPEAKER_03: Somehow, as far as I remember, I was always really not nationalistic, not patriotic too much. I guess I just didn't like how sometimes being too nationalistic
SPEAKER_03: can be used to control the person you know sometimes it's not not for people are using it for a bad thing same religion for example sometimes also it could be used for a bad thing you don't have to be one of them you know you can do in pure feelings you can still be in love with your nation you know
SPEAKER_03: yes of course and of course i am of course i am okay so i'm just careful i don't want to be tricked i don't want to no no no no no i'm not talking about being a fascist or something you know just no no yeah yeah anyway so at least you know since i know that justin cares about it you know yeah that motivates me to to give him that so he okay okay okay so how how do you see
SPEAKER_03: The chances of team is, you know, I guess you saw the guys. Like you saw, let's start like one by one. How do you see John Brzezinski-Petrenko? I think Petrenko wins. Petrenko wins. He showed some very good power lately and recently. And yeah, he's just, I think he's just too strong for John. I got 50 on John. You have $50 betting on John?
SPEAKER_03: yeah what's up take that yeah sure i can take it sure no worries okay okay you guys can come back you know uh privately uh because it is against my belief it's against my belief so i don't get involved um because even if i have my match super match i i tell devon to not to put on the stakings you know because um i don't carolyn caroline loomis thank you for your super chat justin
SPEAKER_00: mindy sounds hurt drain him out usa right yeah plan on you ever yeah we're just gonna suck the life right out of them devin lorette style right here just look at you you ever paint yourself you have i've seen i've seen you pin yourself a couple times you're pretty good at it it's all right
SPEAKER_03: I have to admit that normally I'm really not taking anything personally. I don't get angry on any of my opponents. But here in this case, Justin touched one of the sensitive topics of mine. He was talking about my beard, yes. Ooh. Ooh. I would never think that it would be sensitive. It's a very sensitive topic. I knew it. I can read it. I'm telling you.
SPEAKER_03: patches over here he gets you know he gets in his his panties in a while about his beard now there's nothing i can do about it so i will just be angry i'll be justin just to show my anger okay well what are you gonna do once you take everything and look at justin's face if you can what are you gonna tell me tell him are you gonna remind him this
SPEAKER_00: I almost feel like I, you know, because of this anger, maybe I should just kill him three times in a row with no games. I almost, I'm almost leaning in that direction. Also, we don't want to get too emotional. Just to show that we don't want to get you too emotional. You know, I want you, if you get in that spot, I want you to, you know, hey, my beard is beautiful regardless. What you think? You know, something like that, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to bring you some beard balm. Help it grow. It could be useful. I'm nervous. Are you joking about being sensitive about the beard or you are serious now? You can hear it in his voice, Egan. You can hear it in his voice. He's dead serious. Listen, if it makes you feel better, I'm a little sensitive about my hair because I'm getting old now and my hair is starting to recede a little bit. I don't like it.
SPEAKER_03: Justin, what about you cutting your beard for the match so I feel less intimidated? I thought about that. I actually thought about bringing the chin strap back, you know, from when I first started. But that's too much work. I don't care. I just let it go. Justin, do you think Mindago's hair is better than yours? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. Hey, I'll be the first guy to tell you if you got something better than me. That's about the only thing he's got better than mine, but his hair is pretty. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. How about, how about me? If you beat him, Justin shaves. And if Justin beats you, let's see how confident you guys are. No, I can, I could take it. I could take it.
SPEAKER_03: Why not, yeah? But listen, if you don't shave, I will not invite you to East Georgia. I would shave, no problem. I would shave, no problem. But what about Justin? Oh, I don't know. You shave. No, you shave your beard. You shave your beard if you lose, Justin. Oh, man. That's been like 10 years since I've done that. I mean, are you going to lose? He's not confident. I don't plan on it.
SPEAKER_00: no i don't i don't plan on losing you know it feels like he feels like he knows more confident right now come on okay okay justin knows justin knows he knows what's up hey i'll go home and my kids won't even recognize me i won't even get back in my house you just have to win justin oh all right
SPEAKER_03: So we're talking about your head, though. You're shaving your head, right? I shave my head, yes. Okay, all right. If I lose it. Agreed. So deal? Because this is recorded, you know. This is on social media. This is recorded. No, you turn from here. Okay. You accept to shave your head if you lose it? I do. If I lose it. You got it in your beard?
SPEAKER_03: Yep. Oh. He goes like this. Even more satisfaction. Oh. More motivation. I didn't need any more motivation. Yeah. Okay. So another thing. Let's go to the next one. Devon and Prudnik. Devon.
SPEAKER_03: And how do you see the match is going? Prudnik cannot get inside properly. And then outside, there's no way? Or sideways, no way? No, something might happen, but I don't think it's enough. To win three rounds. Yeah. And do you think there is any way for him to win without the strap? For Devin to win? No.
SPEAKER_03: for prudnik without a set because devon usually depends on strap but i'm just i'm of course i'm not super confident about my choice but i just feel like that one still is gonna make it thing he's gonna of course i can see prudnik he might do well also i don't know if i had to guess i choose them oh okay so you you did
SPEAKER_03: But you said you would bet on Petrenko and John. Petrenko and John, I have a much stronger opinion. Here, not so strong, but still a slight edge to Devon. And how do you see Justin? That much? I mean, I would probably lean towards Devon slightly. I think it's really close. Prudnik and I'd say Prudnik and Hermes has probably been my favorite arm wrestlers for many years now.
SPEAKER_00: And, and for next one, a few people who can do everything extremely well, I would give him the power. It's just a little, you know, overall, but I don't, I'm, I'm with Mindy. I don't think he can get inside and I don't think he can win three rounds outside. So, and then again, you know, yeah. The only thing that's got me on the fence at all is that Devin,
SPEAKER_00: You know, if this was January, I would say Devin 6040. But because it's, you know, in two weeks basically, and I know what Devin's been doing, it's not like he's been on the couch, but he's been training, you know, sparring a lot. So I don't know, you know, I feel like he would be in better shape to do it. 5248 or something? Yeah, something like that. You know, if I had to put money on it, I'd put it on Devin.
SPEAKER_00: uh because he's just being the overall uh bigger human but i think slightly better endurance which what i is what i think is going to come down to you know who can go longer um but you know i also look at what devin did with todd hutchins and then what todd hutchins did with prudnik and you know that's it's a big difference you know hard to hard to
SPEAKER_03: predict right that anything can happen the only problem is that here we are talking about two of the best arm wrestlers about well-roundedness about table iq about yeah technique you know endurance okay about endurance that one is like
SPEAKER_03: without competition, in my opinion, against anyone. If it goes to the endurance. I mean, if someone is much stronger like Levan, of course you cannot talk about endurance there. But if the match is any close, I don't see Devon is losing if the match is close. I mean, even if he loses one round, next round is getting harder and harder for his opponents. But I mean, like both of these guys,
SPEAKER_03: I mean, we know that the open arm top roll with pronation, but he can commit, you know, even a shoulder pressure. He can do many other things, you know. So it is very, very hard for me to predict, you know, as you are saying, you know. Yeah. Let's see how it will be. Let's see. And how do you guys see, how do you see Minerva's Dave Chaffee versus Hermes? I'm interested in your opinion on this one. I say Dave Chaffee.
SPEAKER_03: horsepower will be too much you think yeah just like top roll wise maybe it's the power will be quite equal and then they will be a bit flat and then they will go sideways and then aramis will be somehow out of position and then but again not super sure just a slight same as devon match your opinion is
SPEAKER_00: Same as not like Petrenko-John match? No, no. Okay, okay. And Justin? I mean, I got Dave in that one. I think if Hermes wins, it will be 3-0, and I think it'll be fairly quick. But I think the longer the match goes, and I normally don't say this, but the longer the match goes, the more it favors Dave, I think.
SPEAKER_00: because I don't think Hermes has a big gas tank to begin with. And I don't think he's a very good inside puller at this level. You know, I'm sure he can beat most people in a hook. But I think with Dave's newfound moves and endurance, you know, it's going to waive his way, I think. And Dave is so stupid strong in the center of the table.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, not many people are that strong. I think Levan, other than Levan, I don't know that there's, and maybe Lepkis as far as center of the table, flat, you know, control in the center. I understand, yeah. Anyway, so I was going to
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's go to the next one. Minda goes Morozov and Hermes left arm. Morozov wins. Morozov wins. And this is heavy opinion or a light one? Yeah, this is a bit stronger opinion. Almost like John Petrenko opinion. Yeah, yeah. And Morozov is left-handed, right? Left is his main weapon. Yeah. I don't remember seeing Hermes.
SPEAKER_03: Too much on the left. I don't think his left is as good. I could be wrong. Yeah, I think that is right, but still good, but not as good as his right for sure. So I would say Morozov. He says he's going to win two titles because that's interim titles match. You know, it will be against Dave Chaffee because Jerry is injured. I didn't know about that thing, you know, but the people warned me. So I thought that he would be the better one. And how do you see that match? You follow Morozov?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think basically the same thing. I think you know his left his main weapon is stronger arm. I think he's gonna win. Hermes might slide a win in there. Are you surprised when he beat Cody comfortably? Kind of. But you know, I know.
SPEAKER_00: As much as I love Cody, he has the power to be that guy, but he lacks the speed and the well-roundedness to be at the top of the hill like that. So I wasn't surprised. I picked Cody to win because I thought it was close. And if it stayed outside, I thought it would be close. But no, I don't think Hermes is going to win that one either.
SPEAKER_03: And if you go quickly, Revas versus Morozov in Divas? Right hand? Yeah. Revas is great. He's a big boy. Revas is going to topple Morozov, you think? Yeah. And how heavy is this opinion? Very strong opinion here. Wow, it's interesting because Morozov beat Dave Chaffee. And if you believe Revas is going to beat Morozov,
SPEAKER_03: then you probably see Morozov somewhere very high. Maybe a possible opponent for Levan in the future? You are talking about Lutidze, right? Not Morozov. Yeah. Yeah, I do see that Lutidze could be very good. But maybe he has some motivation problems sometimes, it seems like. If he wins far enough, I'm sure he could be very good. I understand. And you?
SPEAKER_03: That's the same guy that beat Michael Todd, right? Yeah, but whenever he pulled Michael Todd, I mean, nothing to take away from Michael. He was great in that match as well. But from 2018 to 2022, Revas didn't train for years. And then I offered him a match two months before the match. So he trained two months. I mean, technically,
SPEAKER_00: Michael, I mean, took his risk, everything, but because he has huge frame and, you know, he still didn't give up. So his form is probably better than that match. Yeah. And, you know, as much as I like Morozo, and I think he's one of those guys that's going to be top two or three for the next several years, the way he's going, I don't think he's going to win that right arm match because the other guy,
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think if that's him off the couch with two months of training, I mean, now it's been what, four or five months? Two months before the May event. After that, he had another two and a half months. It was four and a half months. And now he has three and a half months more. So it will be about eight months he will be training for Morozov match. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: See, I don't, and a guy that, that massive and, um, you know, and you can say, uh, Mike was on a downward slope or Mike didn't show up that day or whatever, but I don't, I don't really care too much of training off the couch. And you're doing that with Mike, you know, pretty, you're pretty legit in my book, you know, and it's just such a massive guy. Uh,
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think, I think he's going to take, I think all of this inside power is going to be too much. Oh, he's a top roller. Well, I mean, the way he's, he's got this going with that, you know. I understand, yeah. Anyway, so, um,
SPEAKER_03: So we go, you don't know some of these guys, probably, Justin. But if you know, I want your prediction as well. But if you don't know, you don't have to give it. But Mindago's for sure knows. And Daniel was 75-12, probably on the competition day, right? I mean, he was only 78. And he said he will be about 82-83 kilos against Samusha. And Samusha will be 85 kilos, Daniel 83 kilos.
SPEAKER_03: and Samusha is also, you know, going inside. How do you see that match, Minervis? Your opinion is important. I think Samusha should be able to win because now he had enough time to somehow bring his shape up. I think he should be strong enough to beat Daniel because, you know, as long as you are mainly
SPEAKER_03: a hook puller you are comfortable inside that's the best technique to deal with daniel right just to go hook him because he likes the he has a lot of um press power transferred into his hook i guess i think if you're talking about daniel or the summer ship and now i'm about daniel like daniel you know i would consider daniel being mostly a press guy
SPEAKER_03: Not so much bicep. Yeah, you're right. Exactly. So I feel like Samusha being good in the bicep hook things, he should be able to take Daniel out of position and then finish. Yeah. I mean, I'm very interested. Very interested in that match. Do you know those guys? Do you know Samusha? Yeah, I've been studying him a little bit since I've noticed their pulling in his last match.
SPEAKER_00: I think I'm kind of with Mendoza. I don't think, I don't know that Daniel's quite big enough. You know, because. Yeah, I mean. That's why Mendoza will also lose against you. At some point, at some point it does.
SPEAKER_03: some point if they if it didn't you wouldn't have weight classes yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean i had mindagas we had some super matches and before the super match we tease each other a lot and from that time you know we have the little going on normally as an organizer i don't do predictions of the match or something and even again to you too i don't have any prediction i have opinions it can go either way if it goes it can go either way i say it because it can go either
SPEAKER_03: I don't say that, but I know that he doesn't get offended when I say that. He knows that I'm teasing you. You know, right? I'm teasing you. Yeah, no worries, Engin. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Engin, you also know that if he pulled again, you would lose. So it's like, it doesn't really matter. It's just... What's that? No, nothing, nothing. Never mind. What did you say, Justin? What did you say? Nothing, nothing. He said he would smash you.
SPEAKER_03: I felt so sorry that you know, like, like, I mean, I, I, I don't know. I was like, come on, it's not fair. You know, like I shouldn't be that strong. You know, I was like, I even hold him and bring him down to here. He went and I brought him back, you know, just, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You were definitely better on that day. Better? What better, better, better? What better is you? You mean like twice, you know? Yeah, it's okay. It's okay. I make a way better. Small. Did you see that, Matthew? It was like this. Whenever I hit, where do you go? But whenever I control, I was like this. I will tell you something, while you're here.
SPEAKER_03: I don't even try to topple you. Whenever I just wait, you try to topple me, you lose your own wrist. You realize that, right? Could be the case. I mean, when I was 65, I got so skinny, I still topple you. I mean, without my intention. You move, you do your move, you lose your wrist. I mean, his wrist is, I mean, Justin. Like butter. Yeah. I'm joking.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'll tell you this. Corey Miller had some high praise for you. Apparently, you got the message. I think he said he acted like he got the full world or something. Was it? And what did he say? Oh, he acted like I was going to get my ass whooped. So basically. Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But, you know, what's funny is he's never even arm wrestled me, so I don't know how, you know, just because he's weak, he assumes I'm weak, I guess. I don't know. You know. Well, it's still a good sign for me, I guess. Yeah. Well, I figured, you know, since Egan was ragging on you, I figured I'd give you a boost, you know, let you know my countrymen are looking for you to win, so.
SPEAKER_03: to get some lithuanian friends it looks like justin do you american lightweights have any kind of phobia against the european lightweights when you go there like do you guys say like
SPEAKER_03: these guys are damn strong, or do you guys like, I mean, not all of you are the same, but do you have this psychology that, you know, like Travis always portrays, I mean, don't go there, you know, don't go there, you know, I mean, if you are not a super heavyweight guy, just don't go there with don't pull those guys with weird last names or something, you know, like, are you any intimidated or you are like, I mean, like comfortable. I mean,
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm, I mean, I'm, I usually rest my confidence in my, uh, in my training and knowing what I have done, you know, um, I don't really build my confidence off, uh, false, you know, my, all my confidence comes from what I've done or what I'm doing. And then I judge, you know, I'm, I look through, through a non-biased lens. If I'm, if I have people to look at, like I've been looking at Mendoza's matches and things.
SPEAKER_00: I don't tell myself, well, he doesn't do this well, just to make myself feel better. You know what I mean? I go, okay, this man can arm wrestle here. Even when I pulled Ryan Bowen, 2017, I kept telling people, I was like, this guy can arm wrestle. It's just a matter of if he's strong or not. Luckily, he wasn't anywhere near my strength at that time. But, no, I mean, I know what European arm wrestlers can do. I've been over there a couple times. But then on the flip side, when they came here,
SPEAKER_00: a lot of times it doesn't work out. You know, so it's, I mean, they can come here and win, obviously. People can, as we can go over there and win. But, you know, if the, like, for example, the tournament I pulled in 2013 where I beat Giannis, I didn't know half the people there, you know. So I just come in knowing what I'm going to do, the move I'm going to try to execute. So,
SPEAKER_00: You know, it kind of helped me to not know who they were, you know. So, no, I'm never intimidated by an opponent. You know, like, I mean, obviously, sometimes you can watch too much on a guy and intimidate yourself. You know, like, I don't know if I can beat this guy. And you let that thought.
SPEAKER_00: lag around you know where are you now after watching all these videos where are you now you know what kind of psychology i mean you you must be in somewhere good you know that's on your beard right now i feel good um you know i'm pretty sure he's got one one and a half moves he's gonna try you know if the if the ace in the hole doesn't work i pretty much know where he's going and it's not much different than the
SPEAKER_00: ace in the whole move. You can try this if you want to, you know, but I don't recommend it. How do you judge my power level? Like, how do you know if you are strong enough, for example? It is hard to judge. That's one of the things I was saying, you know, one of the reasons I brought up Ryan is because it was hard to judge because he had arm wrestled nobody that I had arm wrestled or, you know, you'd have to put five or six matches together to get anywhere close to,
SPEAKER_00: what you think would be, you know, his power level, so to speak. So it's hard to judge, but I can, like, you got enough stuff on there where you're lifting certain weights and certain matches. Like I've pulled enough with Giannis and seeing you and him go back and forth. What's hard, I will say is hard to judge is the tournament styles. Cause you don't know where in the tournament you arm wrestled or any of that stuff. So, but I would say that,
SPEAKER_00: I would have to agree with your own assessment. I think you're a better supermatch puller than a tournament puller because you're a more defensive guy. Whereas that always plays to a better supermatch style than a tournament style. But as far as the overall technique with stuff you can diagnose pretty accurately through a video, I don't think you know any more than I do. So that gives me a lot of confidence.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you can ask the same question to yourself, Mindaugas. How do you know they are stronger? He doesn't. And the question is, when have you been bald last time? When you're bald? I think at some point during my student years, I was too poor to go and get a haircut, so I had to just do it myself and I kept it short.
SPEAKER_03: that's ballsy but yeah how do i know yeah i just know that i'm constantly fighting some of these best guys in the world like daniel and janice and some other guys or even some bigger guys for example uh to door oleg to dorian did very well during this uh yeah championship number one second or second on both arms i think okay he took second in the 80 kilo
SPEAKER_03: class above you yeah you beat him in a super match right arm badly but you beat him and left arm comfortably yeah so and um yeah again nanastad was another guy this year tom holland um one more guy um so basically i just know that it's hard to be that much better than uh than me at this weight right
SPEAKER_03: which somehow it tells me that Justin might be equal to me, but he can't. I don't think he can be that much stronger. There is one guy, Cody. I was going to say one of the matches. I'm sorry, go ahead.
SPEAKER_03: whenever i say i'm against betting i'm talking about money you know even this not not not like you know if i lose i shave my hair or something these are to me that the innocent thing is i don't call it like really gambling you know like like it's just different to me different at least sorry go ahead go ahead just i was just gonna say you know one of those two maybe two people that i could get a rough gauge and
SPEAKER_00: I don't even like going off of what I'd call a rough gauge because it is rough and it's not accurate. Uh, but I pulled with Tom on the side table a few times at, uh, WAL events and yeah. And I've pulled with, uh, Ray quite a few times. I think I've seen you and Ray practice before. Um, I've pulled with, uh, what's his name? Vlad. I've pulled with him on the side table before. Um,
SPEAKER_00: And then Nicholas, you know one guy that. He's pulled RVJ. You pulled him, you know and. He wasn't even able to crack RVJ's wrist at all, and I was able to cut roll RVJ so. You know, and that's a different. I feel like that's a different nonestead. I will say that because when when RVJ pulled him it was. I don't know 18 or 19. And.
SPEAKER_00: If I'm not mistaken, Nicholas has been on a little bit of a break prior to the match with you. I'm not sure. I haven't seen him in a while, I'll say that. You beat Rob one round in your match? Yeah. I had him beat in the second round and I got in a hurry and screwed it up. But
SPEAKER_00: But still having one of those, you know, is impressive. Yeah, I mean, he hasn't lost. I'm trying to remember. I don't think he's lost a match against anybody in the league except Craig Choulier. Me and Craig are the only people that beat him. So, you know, the only people that beat me that they lined me up with was Storm and RBJ.
SPEAKER_03: what was your weight when you pull uh rob i was probably 195 195. so you will be 180 here but probably competition day you will be over 185 correct yeah because i walk around about friday morning and then you're gonna pull saturday evening so yeah if you cut some water and eat good you know i think yeah
SPEAKER_00: So, and you were, what did you say? You were 195 when you pulled, Rob? Yeah, when I pulled RVJ. Yeah, I normally, it's hard for me to get that big. I have to eat a lot and I have to meal prep a lot. And once I hit about 190, I start feeling fat. You know what I mean? So, start, it's hard to tie my shoes kind of thing. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: because I'm constantly eating all the time. So I don't like to, I don't like to, I don't mind cutting a little bit of weight because I've been fat a good while, so. Mindago, do you think that Nanestad is stronger than Justin? Or do you think that there is a possibility that Justin could be as strong as Nanestad or even stronger?
SPEAKER_03: so none of that to me at least i felt him to be very explosive but as soon as he was stopped the difference was big in power so even if justin is like a lot stronger in the statical static hold well he is not that explosive is none of that you're saying
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, exactly. So, an explosivity, that's what I don't like. You know, as long as people are a bit slower, not too overly explosive, then I'm going to stop them. And did you tell me that you had another super match 20 minutes before that match? Yes, correct. So, I have another match. And then 20 minutes later, you put Nannestad. Yeah. Yeah, okay. And Nannestad was fresh. Same arm? Same arm, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: yeah but but your your match was probably walking in the park one before or maybe you shouldn't talk you shouldn't talk exactly exactly yeah yeah but but but i i'm my guess my guess if it was so hard i don't think that you could be honest that's my guess but just you again you don't need to say anything that's interesting anyway so this is good this is good that you guys you guys are uh caroline loomis again justin who do you think would win
SPEAKER_00: with Jaggers and versus Derek Smith, Matt, just postponed. That's a tough match. Right-handed? I'd have to give the edge to Derek right now. I mean, I think both of those guys are on a high trajectory. You know, the sky's the limit right now.
SPEAKER_00: I'd have to give it to Derek right now, especially, you know, he's probably got the experience advantage. If I'm not mistaken, he's taller, longer. Yeah, I think it'd be a pretty good match, though. For some reason, we're not having many good heavyweight matches lately in America. I mean, if you are a world-level guy, it is normal that, you know, the only match will be only in your country. I mean, it is just...
SPEAKER_03: after the point you know some unnecessary you know we have one world and if you think you are world level that matches you know not only american american american against each other of course that needs to happen too it is normal that we bring so many countries to one place and then they pull and then we see who is really the the the best but again you know we say east versus west but as you said at the beginning of the program that you know it is basically
SPEAKER_03: like us versus worlds, you know, and sometimes it's North America versus, uh, walls. Of course we have, this is the second time we're going to have, uh, pull us from Brazil as well, but, um, let's see. And the last things, you know, I want to ask, how do you generally see the cards? Do you find the card exciting enough? People say it's very good, but what's your opinion? It's amazing.
SPEAKER_03: Seriously, it's going to be such an honor to be part of it. It's I can't believe it is. It is also my honor to host you guys, all of you, all of you. And thank you for accepting me, Douglas. And thank you accepting the offer, Justin. Yeah, I will be honored. It's my pleasure, brother. I think you could argue this is the best card put together that I've seen. I mean, as far as matches go, who's going to be there?
SPEAKER_03: I mean, between the special guests. There is Devon Larratt. There is John Bersink. I'm talking North America is Dave Chaffee, Matt Mask, Pauline, Justin Bishop, Cobra Rhodes, Adam Wozniacki. I mean, wow, you know. And then you have the other guys in Descartes, not only against the Americans, but then you have Hermes Gasparini, Evgeny Prudnik, Artem Morozov, Ravaz Vuzice,
SPEAKER_03: You have Gamtenaze, Mindaugas, and Zurab. Haidar is many times world champion armwrestler. Petrenko you have, and Kalinyshenko, Dizerano, Wagner Bortolato. Come on. It's good. It's good. I mean, I hardly not to say my opinion about it, but it is good, you know, because if I say my opinion, you will not be humble. But sometimes I look at it that I'm organizing, and then sometimes I get out.
SPEAKER_03: And then just look at it. If someone else was organized, I would just say, what the fuck, you know, what's this? You know, just seriously, I would just say that it is amazing to me from my point. And I will just sit there and watch you guys. And then every or any or every of this match, because do you know why it's so interesting for me? I am setting those match because it is so interesting to me that I'm setting those matches. You understand? Whenever I look at it. Yeah. Because whenever I said them, I'm like, okay, who's going to win there? So it is.
SPEAKER_03: especially for me that is the most most interesting as well you know sometimes i didn't do so well job about setting these matches but most of the times they are they're very good matches let's see how it will be and i will be very very happy to host you guys not not so much left right probably in two weeks no no in 15 days 15 days the match is gonna have matches are gonna happen so probably in what 12 days 11 12 days i will see you guys yeah and then then
SPEAKER_03: I will bring you don't worry about I will bring enough of razor and the air machine, you know. Anyway, so yeah if you want to add anything last word you add it, and then we can we can close. You go, I was just gonna say I was just gonna say what you know, basically, what you said man honor it is I haven't been i've been on a card with.
SPEAKER_00: All kinds of superstars, but I can't remember the last time I was on a card with this many legends of the sport. It's probably been since 2013. So, you know, people on the card and the guests, like I'm a big fan of Gary. That's when you invited him. I think I've done a backflip. Because without that, I would never meet Gary. He doesn't arm wrestle anymore. He lives in Canada. Because I'm a big MMA fan.
SPEAKER_00: You know, I've watched MMA since I was five, six years old. So not only arm wrestling, you know, MMA. And I've never met Dennis or LeVon, so I'm looking forward to that, too. But, yeah, I'm just grateful to be a part of it, brother. And I appreciate you and all of your efforts and all of your team. Appreciate Mendoza for taking the match. And I hope you all stay safe until the time to do it.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah let's have some fun yeah and it is gonna be fun because of a bet it really makes it even better now somebody's gonna be hairless oh yeah the bet is only giving me motivating me even more yeah yeah just just save some fun for the press conference you don't want to look like you know huh you know like that i'm sure that the the the the
