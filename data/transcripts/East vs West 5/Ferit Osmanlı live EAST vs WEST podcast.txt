SPEAKER_04: Hello, guys. Hello, Yuri Makarov. Hello, Phil. Hello, Paul Strang. Hello, WTC HR.
SPEAKER_04: Michael workspace. Hello. And you're from Texas. Hello, my friend. AGM Hello engine. This is Hello, my friends. Get more regulated. Hello, Roman. How are you, my friends? I'm fine. I'm just not so motivated. Not so bad. You know, just
SPEAKER_04: I will have guests, my friend Ferit Osmanlı. Hello, Victor. Hello, my friends. Hello, Engin Turbo. Nice to see you guys. Very soon in probably less than... Guys, do you hear me? It says here that, you know, it's still trying to connect or something.
SPEAKER_04: Um, I mean, my friend, if, if Iraq begins to ridicule or this or that, you know, just, it's too early. We need to go, you know, step by step, you know, hello Iraq. Thank you. I'm fine. I'm doing good brother. Just planning my November month. It will be nice to see you. Yeah. I made a video already today.
SPEAKER_04: Um, a short, um, thoughts about King of the table. Okay. Sound is good. That's good. That's good. Thank you. Let's see what Ferit has to say about upcoming matches. Let's see if he thinks different than many of us.
SPEAKER_04: So, who do you think should be the next opponent for Dave? Secret. Saludos Jesus.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Neal invited me. Do you think Vitaly would easily beat Arsene? I'm not super sure, but he has a portion more chance. Do you still think Vitaly would... No, sorry. What do you think about Hermes versus Morozov?
SPEAKER_04: Um, just, you need to consider when you ask me these questions, because I'm the organizer. I can't, I can't like say everything I believe. Um, I can only tell you the possibilities, how the mesh would most likely will go, you know, let me bring this down a little bit to show my old school labs t-shirts. Um,
SPEAKER_04: Do I know anything about Devon and Evgeny's practice book? Maybe I do, maybe not. Alex, 1750, ferret wood, steamroll, brass ring. One is 58 years old, other one is much younger, around 40. So ferrets would be favorites in my eyes as well.
SPEAKER_04: I would join Brzezinski against Ferid right now. I think Ferid would beat him. Not many people on this earth can beat Ferid right now. Oh, Engin Drake says, you are like God. Thank you, I love you too, but that word is...
SPEAKER_04: big sin in my belief. Even it doesn't mean, didn't mean it to be said in that way, but thank you. I understand that I, you consider more like a servant of Armistice, like I'm serving the community to the support. So we tell him he will remain unranked until he beats someone in top 10. It's hard to, I think that I'm not gonna do the world ranking because it just gives me so much
SPEAKER_04: my ranking, but if I wanted to decide the world ranking, I can't, but now people will say, okay, where will you rank Vitaly? And then, then, then the other guy beat him, Zaur beat him and Ferit beat him. So Hermes will destroy Morozov. He says, let's see. I wouldn't be so sure anything can happen.
SPEAKER_04: Sorry if I'm pronouncing wrong. Hello Engin, thank you for your support. Hello Engin, hello my friend. I feel bad for schoolboy that under the table
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I'm not a fan of it. You know, everybody knows it's strength, old school. Hello, Engin Terzi. Hello, my friends. Perit versus Arif. What's that? Open class wins right hand. I don't know. I need to pull. Hello, Engin. Greetings from Poland. Hello, Zizemi. Sorry if I'm pronouncing wrong. Hello, my friends, and greetings to Poland.
SPEAKER_04: Revas is the biggest threat in near future for Levan. What do you think, Engin? Thanks for the interaction with people. You're welcome and thank you for following me. My friend, I cannot say biggest, but for sure one of the biggest. We don't know who is the biggest threat. Time will show. Yes, Ferit look insanely big and strong in Chechnya. He's too much for Burzink at the moment. At the moment, yes.
SPEAKER_04: We are talking, I and Ferit are talking about what he needs to do to be even better. He's a smart guy, very experienced. And Brzing versus Ferit, same weight? No, my friend. Ferit is probably 130, most likely 25. Didn't Ferit say he's nothing compared to his prime 2006 shape? He didn't say he's nothing compared to his prime, but he said
SPEAKER_04: As far as I remember, he said his 2006 shape was better. Hello, Engin, do you remember any of the winners, Europeans 1997? I didn't go to Europeans 1997. Ferit, can you turn your phone to the side? You have to turn it off. It didn't work. Volume. Click.
SPEAKER_04: Um, I don't remember. I was in the 97, but I heard 97. Um, no, I don't remember. I first time I put Europeans 98. First one I put was 93, but the Europeans was five years later. Okay. So let's start. You hear me Ferit?
SPEAKER_04: Do you think Shafiq could beat Gennady or Morozov if he used the block press? I don't know, my friends, I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I don't know how good is flop wrist compared to Jerry. I don't think it's as good as that one because Jerry has been pulling that way for 30 years. Hmm.
SPEAKER_04: I don't think I'm looking younger, my friends. I need shave. Whenever I shave, I look a little bit younger. And you are going to ask for his opinion about King of Table 5. Yes, my friend. I will ask, but I think there is an audio problem. And I don't know what he's doing, but he's probably. Alaykum salam, Kaan Yanar.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, but it was love and many do you understand it.
SPEAKER_04: Can you hear me? You can hear me now. Can you turn your phone to the side? Let the screen be big. Okay. Let me see if the headphones come out. Speak, brother. It's coming, it's coming. It's coming again. Speak, let me see. Is my voice coming? It's coming very little. If you want to wear it, you can wear it. Okay, Ferit says...
SPEAKER_04: he doesn't hear me well so he's gonna use the earphone yeah yeah we are just asking how are you to each other um
SPEAKER_04: There is a question. Thank you for super chat. Hello, Engin. Muhammad here. How are you doing? Thank you, my friend. I'm doing fine. Do you believe Ferit versus Dave Chaffee will be in a future East versus West? Let me ask him. For me, yes. But let me ask you. Ferit, there is a guy named Pabnaful here. In the future, will there be a match between Dave Chaffee and Ferit in East versus West?
SPEAKER_00: Yes. First of all, thank you for a good question. Look, why haven't I made it to the top so far? You know, we always had traumas. Right now, I'm ready to play with everyone.
SPEAKER_04: He says, Engin, you know that we have been having traumas and for many years, but he said that he found a nice way to keep his arm healthy. And he said that right now he's ready to compete against anyone except Levan. But he said at a point, if he feels himself, you know, that he deserves,
SPEAKER_04: He would like to also pull against Levan, but not as of now. And Umru is asking, Engin, are you going to ask Ferit's opinion about King of the Table 5? Ferit, what do you think about the match in Dubai? I liked it. It was a good match for Alettin. But I'm going to be honest with you. He's a great athlete.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, Ferit says that, you know, if he needs to be honest, he said he was like,
SPEAKER_04: great tough event tough match but in a technical point he didn't um it wasn't as good as he expected in a technical point um so yes for future events most likely 10 matches but i will have i will try to do every month um
SPEAKER_04: Okay, but it won't slow using hyper again, and it would be better. They have history of to predict then you are saying again, I didn't much die older, they were on the ocean and you saw a lot of you off. So do we get to see the watch?
SPEAKER_00: He says that he says that, you know, yes, he agreed that he needs to pull with
SPEAKER_04: uh there is something to be take care from the past and um um he said why not you know and someday yeah why not
SPEAKER_04: I think it would be a good match. Thank you guys. Thank you for the support. Yeah. He said that he is 130 kilo. Yeah, I was right about it. 130 kilo.
SPEAKER_04: He said that in Chechnya, when he competed, he was 137 kilos. Both were green shirts, white ones. Yeah, we didn't mean to. One of them was black, the other one was green. And the other one was white.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah he said that we are brothers so it's normal alaikum brother uh hello chance how are you my friends yep it's 100 correct translation yes um let's see yeah yeah you put in so many like question marks like not technical huh you know
SPEAKER_04: I mean, the guy that you are questioning is just, I mean, the guy has wins against Pushkar, against Kanai, against John Brzee, against Travis Bergen, whoever, just you think, just come on, just be a little bit, you know, know your place. When you say the technical point, he meant like he expected them to have better hand control. I think that's what he meant.
SPEAKER_04: In terms of technique, there are those who criticize me for not finding it beautiful, but I guess I didn't have a nice wrist control or something. That's probably why. Whose? Why do you think so?
SPEAKER_04: You know, instead of just having those angles and injuries like this, he was expecting more control with better angles. This is what he tried to say.
SPEAKER_04: But it was a good match. Respect to the great world champion Ferit. My question is that he likes more top roll than hook now. I know he can hook now due to injuries. He says he respects you a lot right now. Does he hook more than hook because his tongue is injured? Because my tongue is injured, I didn't press as much as I used to.
SPEAKER_00: Because I didn't do it, I adapted myself to pull myself a little more so that it wouldn't happen again. I don't have any problems right now. I've been treated. I don't have any pain in my arms.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he says that, you know, he has been injured from inner elbow, but right now he's healthy, but he will try to go hook, you know, slowly because even he's healthy for many years, he couldn't go inside and it is not as strong as before. So he needs to be careful and slowly needs to go there.
SPEAKER_04: abd min ibadallah um assalamu alaikum to you engin and ferit um araboli match off no araboli versus chance match will happen you know it is uh most likely january if we don't do anything in december but um i don't know if even uh chance would be available for this um
SPEAKER_04: Schoolboy Bowen. Yeah, Schoolboy Bowen would be a good one too, yeah. This is Dave versus Hermes would be amazing. Yes, I agree. Arif Ertem'le Ferit Osman'lı maç atarsa sonuç ne olur? Yapmaları lazım. Yapmadan bir şey demek mümkün değil.
SPEAKER_04: Dennis is already good enough to beat most of top 10 except Levan. Ferit Ferit doesn't think that way. Ferit thinks that he cannot beat most of the top 10 as you are saying.
SPEAKER_04: um but not as owner he needs to he needs to get uh better and stronger he says that you know to top rollers you know he would not he would not beat uh the top rollers you know
SPEAKER_04: for sure he says that good top rollers he would be some of the hook pullers uh good hook pullers but the top rollers he's not saying he cannot beat in the future but he's saying as of now he cannot in this way um
SPEAKER_04: Engin, who do you want to see Denis pull? I don't know. Let him decide because he's making a comeback. Yesterday he said that he would like to pull someone who is not very strong for the start. So let him decide. For those kind of people, I am thinking that we should not push them because they are special people. They are trying to make a comeback. You don't want to discourage them.
SPEAKER_04: You need to encourage them, so let them choose the opponent and if the opponent also accepts, so let them pull. Okay. Someone asks you, my friend, can you ask his opinions about Zaur and his chances against Levan? What do you think about Zaur and what can you do against Levan right now? How much chance do you have?
SPEAKER_00: I don't think there is a chance right now. Ferit says that he doesn't think that Zahur has a chance against Levan. Let me say this. Let me comment on this then. Zahur beat all of us there. But in a single match, if I were asked if I would play with Larittin,
SPEAKER_04: Zahurla mı yaparsın diye sorarlarsa ikisiyle yaparım. Ama kolay maç için Zahur'u tercih ederim. Neden? Yorulabilir mi diyorsun? Altıra aldım maç. Her türlü. Ferit says that Zahur beat both Laletin and Ferit. But Ferit says that if somebody would ask him, would you want to pull a super match against Laletin?
SPEAKER_04: or Zaur he said he would pull both of them you know different times but he said he would choose Zaur because he thinks that in a six round super match he says that um um Laletin may be uh more difficult than Zaur so probably he's thinking that you know Zaur's explosiveness is so good but possibly maybe he would he would uh
SPEAKER_04: That's out, but that is only his opinion. We don't know this. This guy is asking, can you please ask if it is possible for him to be top 10 in 2023? I don't know. He already beats Laletin and
SPEAKER_04: I know I don't put them in the ranking because they didn't pull anyone outside of Russia until yesterday. But if anyone thinking that those guys are in top 10 and I think that Ferit Ferit already is in top 10 in my opinion, but let me ask him. Sana soruyorlar 2023te Ferit dünyada ilk olarak girebilir mi diyor da benim düşünceme göre zaten ilk ondasın.
SPEAKER_04: I don't put my ranking because I haven't played with these sides yet. Only the Russians play among themselves. Laletin has just started, but do you see yourself in the top 10 right now? Or where do you see yourself? I see myself in the top 10.
SPEAKER_04: victor why are you all the time repeating the same thing my friend yeah we read it yes i understand i mean if it is a good i mean if this is the real news which i already knew already but um um
SPEAKER_00: He said that he sees himself in top seven. Um, okay. Dennis and John much of a bit of. Uh, Oh, but then isn't kilos to the ship. Yeah. And John February.
SPEAKER_00: John is now older, you know, compared to his prime time and his weight is
SPEAKER_04: lower than Dennis. And Dennis also is far from his prime. And he said that it would be an interesting match. And he thinks that it would be exciting. Shrek Wazowski, will Engin compete? Engin will compete. Tomorrow, I'm going to have a stem cell therapy tomorrow. And let's see how it will be.
SPEAKER_04: I'm hoping that he will help, and then I can see if I can make a comeback. We already asked him about Dave. He said he would pull. I mean, what do you want me to ask his matchup against Dave? He said he would pull anyone, but what exactly do we want him to say? If he can beat Dave or not? He said that he would pull anyone right now.
SPEAKER_04: And he believes in himself, except against Levan. This is what he said. Hi Engin, can you ask Ferit his strongest and hardest opponent? Andrei Pushkar. He says Andrei Pushkar, as you heard.
SPEAKER_04: Ferit vs. Prudnik is a good match. Ferit vs. Prudnik is a good match, they ask. And they ask, how is your left arm? My left arm is fine. He says his left is just healthy, it's fine. And they ask, would Prudnik's match be good? I don't know. We need to try. He said, yeah, he said we should try, you know, to find out how it would be. But if he offers, I'll do it with pleasure.
SPEAKER_04: He said that if there is any offer, he would pull him right and left, it doesn't matter. Ali for Ferit who is stronger, both are very strong, they need to pull against each other to find out. Ferit versus Gennady, Ferit versus Revas, Ferit versus Irakli, I would love to see him against any Georgians.
SPEAKER_04: Thoughts on the Dadikyan delay. Should he have been disqualified earlier for stalling? What stalling means? I don't know. I think there's a word that hardest and most uncomfortable hand he has ever... En zor ve rahatsız edeceği el kimdeydi diyor. O da puşkat galiba değil mi? Rahatsız edeceği.
SPEAKER_04: He said that his hand grip was so strong and he was just loading up, you know, so strong. So he was Pushkar. Can you ask Ferit about his training style with weights? How does he train his wrist and back grip?
SPEAKER_00: They ask me how I work my back, my pull-ups. How? Do I have to show it here? I work in the machine, with weights, with ropes and stuff. The workouts we know. I do barfix a little. I like barfix.
SPEAKER_04: I think most on depending on his let's draw instead of the brachialis and he said that he's also training with the weights, you know, I think he's just he's talking about I don't
SPEAKER_04: No, my friend, I don't know if Dadikian was making delay for the grip. I have no idea. I didn't feel so. He was complaining that he didn't see his knuckle. I don't know what the referee thought, so it is up to the referee.
SPEAKER_04: Why do they say that this wrist fight is not popular in Asia? Isn't it popular? Who says it's popular? The Kazakhs, the Uzbek, the Kazakhs, the Kazakhs, the Kazakhs, the Kazakhs, the Kazakhs, the Kazakhs, the Kazakhs, the Kazakhs, the Kazakhs, the Kazakhs, the Kazakhs, the Kazakhs, the Kazakhs, the Kazakhs,
SPEAKER_00: There are many in Kazakhstan and all over the world. For example, Şahdara is a famous club. Is it popular outside of Kazakhstan? It is popular. Uzbekistan is also doing it. They don't publish it, but they are doing very good tournaments in their own business. Of course, because there is no prize.
SPEAKER_04: Ferit says, I know you said not Kazakhstan, but in Kazakhstan, I mean, it's very popular. And also in Uzbekistan, they say that they are doing a lot of tournaments. They don't show outside, you know, but they are having a lot of competition. Ferit, are you in the best shape of life? Or are you better than you were in 2005-2006? Maybe you can be better now, but are you better than you are now?
SPEAKER_00: He says that in the past,
SPEAKER_04: He was very strong and energetic. Now he is more experienced. And I said, which shape of you would win? And I also thought that his shape from 2006 would hook his head right now. And he said, yeah, yeah, that shape of me would hook and beat him. Is his outside pulling better? Andre is asking.
SPEAKER_04: He says that right now his top row skill is better than the past. But in the past, his hook was incredible. Engin, does Ferit remember his left hand fight against Artem Klimanko?
SPEAKER_00: They're asking if you remember your last match with Artem Klymenko. I remember my last match with Artem Klymenko. It was a bit... A good match? No, it wasn't a good match. I got injured there. But here's the thing. I was stronger. I always beat him in the arena. But I was living in Uzbekistan at the time. I belonged to a village. I accepted the match there, but normally I shouldn't have accepted it.
SPEAKER_00: he doesn't like to make excuses but normally when they were pulling for training with klimenko in russia
SPEAKER_04: But it was beating him. He said that he said that he shouldn't share this with me. It sounds like an excuse, but he said he was in Uzbekistan and he fell down from horse everywhere on his body was in bruises. He said that he shouldn't go and compete, but he said there was a very good prize money offer. He went. It was a tough match, but he lost.
SPEAKER_04: I'm so glad that Ferid is with us in your channel. Hello and good luck. Thank you. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, Klimenko had huge potential. Correct, Andrei. He was, he was. Güzel, teknik bir sporcu. Güzeldi, iyiydi. Ferid also is thinking he was a very technical competitor.
SPEAKER_00: They are asking you what made you join Bilek Güreş? What made me join Bilek Güreş? We always do Bilek Güreş at weddings and associations in Sülale.
SPEAKER_00: My father was very strong. He used to beat everyone. When I was little, I used to come and play with my uncles. That's how it started. Then I went to the gym. We also have a lot of wristwatches in Uzbekistan. That's how we started. I already loved it when I was little. I watched it all the time. He said it is a tradition in his family.
SPEAKER_04: and with the relatives you know if there is any like a wedding or anything you know they were armless and all the time so that is how it started so it is a family thing family and also relatives um can you ask who is impressed in latest time of the youngsters like morozov iraqi dadikyan tobias
SPEAKER_00: Young people? Young people are the ones who are young. Not those who compete in young people, but those who are 20 years old and which one of them affects you from the bottom? There is Zalaev's younger brother in the younger generation, I like him very much. We are the remaining Zalaevs. I like him very much.
SPEAKER_04: And Tautiyev is good. I like Tautiyev. We're playing well. Tautiyev beat Gachevski. He said that he likes Tautiyev but he lost to Gachevski. No, he beat him but he plays very well. He doesn't even think about the press. He plays well. He said that he lost to Gachevski but his technique is very good and his top-roll ability is very good against hook-ballers especially. Gachevski beat him but I said that because young people asked.
SPEAKER_04: Clemenco versus Taras right-handed was good. Yes, I was right there 2004 European Championships. Clemenco tried to hook Taras and Taras beat him quickly. In the final, Clemenco top-rolled him twice and beat him. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So, and Ferit, I will ask Ferit, who does he specifically, you know, just want to pull against? Who do you want to compete with, Ferit? I mean, who do you want to do first? First of all, I will do it. I swear, I have a lot of people in mind. I don't know, I haven't decided yet. Would you like to tell me what you told me today?
SPEAKER_04: He says that maybe not as of now, but in the future, if after one, two matches at the East versus West, he would like to pull against Devon Larratt. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: He said that maybe in January he would like to pull against Devon Aras. Why do you want to do this? Is it because you haven't thought about it in the past? No, look. Why? Because he did it with a lot of celebrities. He is a strong person. Everyone knows him. Why? I see my potential up there.
SPEAKER_04: he says that devin in his shape good shape he says it's in top five in the world and but ferid also sees himself around there and he would like to pull against him you know if
SPEAKER_04: if it's possible. Can we know how tall is Ferit? Can anyone in the chat? He's 187 cm. It is about 6'1". Another question, if I may, how difficult was grip?
SPEAKER_04: that I was Beijing, what did he feel like, where did he hold the pressure when to start before the goal, that was the true can your name he said you he said to do not say he said to do and never did your basket to do. There are three of them. Which and on job on Madam me. They will be the right time they pull twice. And as far as remember,
SPEAKER_04: Ferit beat him once at Zloty Tour, 2005, and then 2006 Vegas, Ferit beat him. But let's see what he answers. What do you say? You beat him at Zloty and then at Vegas. Who are you talking about? Travis Bageynti. You beat Travis Bageynti in America once. You beat him at Zloty in 2005. You beat him at Zloty once.
SPEAKER_04: He said that he doesn't, as far as he remembers, he doesn't put a lot of pressure. He says with the hand, he says, and he said that he tries to not to allow you to get a good grip on him. This is what he was saying.
SPEAKER_04: Who was the fastest man you've ever raced with? Fast, fast. Can you remember? With the man I raced with?
SPEAKER_00: He said that
SPEAKER_04: he couldn't remember who was the fastest and i reminded him what he thinks about ivan matushenko and he said matushenko is very fast and he said if you are not ready if you are not ready enough then you will really get shocked um the way that he is attacking um
SPEAKER_04: very things he is at his best now or back in the past and we already answered it i'm worried he said that in around mid 2000s like 2005 especially six he said he was in better uh shape yeah yeah and andrea incredible hook inability probably he's talking about you want much you want much you should you know
SPEAKER_04: İnanılmaz hukuk alma kabiliyeti var. Güzel. Değil mi? Güzel oluyor, beğeniyorum. Ferit also agrees with you, Andrei. He says that Ivan Matushenko's hook inability is amazing, he says. Ama şöyle söyleyeyim, bütün dünya Avrupa Şampiyonası'nda ne zaman karşılaşırsanız her zaman yendim ben onu. Ferit says that he has beaten Ivan every time they met. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I always win. Ahmet Burak Atınç, love, respect, brother, love, respect, my lion brother. Ferit, who do you think is the best in the world in the past, in the past, in the past? Do you think, for example, Levan will defeat me in this state, or will Deniz defeat me in a good state? Your own personal, sincere thought. I think my personal thought is that Levan will win.
SPEAKER_04: Deniz had problems with Puskar and Devchef in the past. For example, I think of Puskar and Dimitri Turbin. They beat Dimitri too. He beat Dimitri very comfortably. He beat Levan. I don't know. What do you think? Who is the strongest person in the past?
SPEAKER_00: Let me be honest with you. I like Levan the most. He plays really good, controlled matches. I've never seen him play bad matches. He plays both good and bad matches.
SPEAKER_00: Deniz is very strong. He was a very strong athlete. He was a very strong athlete. I didn't like his matches at all. I have to be honest. He had a nice wrist. Not a nice wrist. He had a big muscle mass and he was hanging around. He was very strong. He was a strongman.
SPEAKER_00: Ferit also thinks as I do, he said that
SPEAKER_04: um he said that he would top roll dennis in his prime and this is prime and then he would beat him he said dennis is super strong and but he has so like big muscles that his open arm angle perry doesn't find dennis so technical while he finds uh levan very technical with great control and he said that you know he's
SPEAKER_00: Even his big size, you know, is incredible for a super heavyweight. He said that he really finds him very good. I mean, I've never seen Lewandowski like this. He's got his wrist out, he's got an ugly punch, his shoulders are open. But maybe, maybe, maybe he's got a nice wrist. Maybe he's not as strong as he is. But let's see what happens in the future.
SPEAKER_04: He said that right now he's the best by far and but who knows in the future maybe someone who would be close to him yeah may appear you know um um
SPEAKER_04: He said that his top row is more like a posting type, not the low and top row. Morozov, what do you think about Morozov right and left arm?
SPEAKER_00: He said that Morozov has good size and good structure, and he said that he is good now, but he said in the future he will be even better.
SPEAKER_04: This is what he's thinking. What do you think about who has the biggest chance to beat
SPEAKER_04: He doesn't see anyone close to Levan. He doesn't think that
SPEAKER_04: It is, I mean, there will be any match that is tough for Levan right now. If he improves himself more and more and more with his top reliability, maybe in the future he would like to pull it, but not now. Nobody is close to him, he says right now.
SPEAKER_04: Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um,
SPEAKER_00: He says that he doesn't know about it. It's hard to compare. Both Dave and Ferit, from hook monsters to top rollers, why not a match between them?
SPEAKER_04: He said he would like to do it. Why not, he says.
SPEAKER_04: And Engin, can you ask his opinion about Ongar Baya? What do you think about Ongar Baya? He is very nice. He is a calm boy. He is a nice guy. I like him. He really likes the way he armwrestles. He topples very good and he is calm. He likes the way he is. And he has positive opinions about that.
SPEAKER_00: They are asking if there will be a competition in Chechnya this year. I wanted to go to Chechnya. After these events here, after a little mix of Russia, and also because your tournament is in S2S, there is very little time left, so you are almost there at the same time. Therefore, in my own country,
SPEAKER_04: he says that he was planning to compete there and but he said that right now the things are getting a little bit confusing in russia um and he also said that he wants to compete in his own country turkey and he said that the matches that he will have here and the
SPEAKER_04: that event in Chechnya are very close time to each other. So he prefer, he choose to compete over here. Sana bir soru soruyorlar. Diyorlar ki, Engin, can you ask Ferit, what does it take to beat Levan? Where are the important strength to compete against Levan? In his opinion. Sence Levan'ı yenmek için ne yapmak lazım diyor.
SPEAKER_04: Levan's weight is very big. He is a technical man. He has a nice wrist. He needs to have a nice muscle mass to eat it. He needs to know how to use his wrist well. He needs to play smart. He needs to be resilient. Thank you. He said that Levan is very big, very muscular, very smart, and he is very technical. And he said to beat him, you also need to be big, muscular. You need to have some size. And also you need to know how to arm wrestle.
SPEAKER_04: What do you think about Rez? I won Rez in Kazakhstan. They played a game for me there, but I'll tell you later.
SPEAKER_04: Timmy Turner is asking, who felt stronger, Slayev or Lallatin? He says that, of course, Lallatin is tougher than Slayev. He says that he is sure of himself that he would beat Slayev in a six-round match, 6-0. He said that, you know, he just
SPEAKER_04: um yes uh nakoda yes ferit is gonna compete the east versus west but not not the next one november is too near right now he's resting and but in january or if we organize in one in december december whatever the first one um jerry le macho
SPEAKER_04: Let him let him keep as a secret. The fishing so far it used to go by Farid Usmanov. I explained that this this period is originally from here after World War One. They just because the border was
SPEAKER_04: They stayed outside of the border. And during the Soviet time, Stalin removed them from here to Asia, to Siberia, to Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan. These are Alaskan Turks. So they are originally from here, but they grew up in Uzbekistan better than his family. But 50 years later, the government right now said that you belong here. This is your land. If you want to come, just welcome.
SPEAKER_04: and they become citizen, but they are originally from here. So he's originally that it was that was his name was given during the Soviet time. Can you please ask athletes from history in their prime would have a chance? Can you please ask which athlete from the history in their prime would have a chance against Levan?
SPEAKER_04: He's thinking that maybe in a super shape,
SPEAKER_04: Maybe it would cause him some problems in his opinion. They will play a Cobra match with Haydar. They are asking about you. They are in the legend category. The legend category. Haydar and Cobra. The match between Haydar and Cobra will be interesting.
SPEAKER_00: If Cobra shoots, maybe Cobra will write. But if Haydar Abiy turns, Haydar Abiy will write. Can they shoot? Or will they fall to the ground? I think it would be like this. If Cobra shoots, if Haydar Abiy is open like this,
SPEAKER_00: Cobra vs. Haydar would be an interesting match.
SPEAKER_04: He said that as he knows, everyone knows that, you know, if Cobra Tappos, he beats, if Haidar Hooks, he beats. But he said that, you know, if Haidar can do that, this pressure. And I said, Haidar doesn't have such ability. He said, time will show, you know. Engin, can you ask him, was he tired when he pulled Ibrahim Sago? You know, Ibrahim Sago won in the Yorgun Muzun, he said.
SPEAKER_00: He says that after the Latin match, as you guys remember, it was a long match, a very long match.
SPEAKER_04: he said he was very very tired he didn't even uh write his name to open class but they they already write him to open class he said that i mean he said that come on guys you know just like and he's saying that can he write him sago pull against him this is what he's saying if he was fresh he said no way you know just andrea saying that what he thinks about jerry jerry
SPEAKER_00: If Ceri stops it, Hermes will finish it. Because Ekrem is playing a match with his wrist open like this. Hermes' arm and shoulder are swollen, so I think he won't be able to play for a long time. But I like Hermes' matches. He's doing a good wrist fight. He's shooting well. If Ceri stays in the middle, I think he'll write to Ceri. So will he stay? Will they take him or will Hermes step on him? Which one do you see the most? Hermes.
SPEAKER_04: He says that if, I mean, he says that Hermes needs to be quick and pin him, take him to the losing side, taking Jerry to losing side to win. He said that if somehow the match stops at the middle of the table, he thinks that, you know, Jerry has the
SPEAKER_04: Jerry said that he can beat Hermes if Jerry stops him at the center. How much did you earn in the AMC tournament? $4,000? $4,000. He said that he can beat $4,000 from there.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, no, Andrew, he already answered that. He said that strongest guy that he ever felt was Andrei Pushkar, he said. Hello, Randy Savage. Jerry has the endurance. What do you think about Michael Todd and Prudnik's match? Michael Todd, Prudnik. Michael Todd, Prudnik. Michael Todd. If he's in good form, I think Michael Todd will win.
SPEAKER_04: He says that he says that if Michael is in a good shape, he said Michael is going to beat Brudnick is what he's saying. And he says that it's going to be a tough match. And he said he thinks that Michael has the edge. And
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Andrea says that I think running is in trouble. It will not be an easy match. In my opinion, he will not. I'm not sure who's going to win, but. It's not going to be easy match. Oh. Oh.
SPEAKER_00: Very strong. Very strong. Very strong. Very strong. Very strong. Very strong. Very strong. Very strong.
SPEAKER_04: He said that if John comes in the shape that he was against Ungar Bayev, he thinks that, you know, Petrenko has more chance to win. He said that John has chance to win if he is in very, very good shape. Very, very good shape, he says. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Well, how do you think the match will be? Morozov and Hermes Solkov, is there a chance? I think Hermes will take the match with Dadikyan that I saw last. But maybe Dadikyan can also be very strong? Is Dadikyan strong? Dadikyan is strong, but his wrist is falling apart, you say.
SPEAKER_00: Ermez, I think it's Ermez. And Dadikyan is not the one who shoots. The one who shoots is a hooker. Even the hooker broke his wrist a little bit. That's why Dadikyan is not that. Ermez is a little heavier. He's both tall and he's fast and he plays controlled matches. I think this match...
SPEAKER_04: Okay, Ferit is thinking that after seeing Morozov versus Dadikyan match, he thinks that Ermes is going to beat Morozov. He says that Dadikyan was able to take Morozov's wrist without a strap. And he said that Ermes is a bigger guy.
SPEAKER_04: then then daddy can and he's more explosive and he thinks that he would he will take more of those risks um
SPEAKER_00: And Ferit says that he prefers Supermatch because it is
SPEAKER_04: like um because in tournament you may meet some rush comes and beats you and in the super match if they get in that way so yeah
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I have no idea. He said he has no idea about that. Um...
SPEAKER_01: He thinks that between 23 and 27, 28 is the strongest time, he thinks.
SPEAKER_04: They're asking what stayed in Ferit's memory from the match that he had against John Brzenk.
SPEAKER_00: And what was the experience out of that match? What do you think of that match? What do you think of that match? What do you think of that match? What do you think of that match? What do you think of that match? What do you think of that match? What do you think of that match? What do you think of that match?
SPEAKER_00: I was late or something happened. I could have gone to the A group. I did some matches because I fell down there. I don't know if it was with Travis or someone else. How was it there? It was a nice hook match. I did a wrist fight with a professional. I gained experience.
SPEAKER_04: He said, you know, people still watch us. He said that he tried to top roll John in the first match and John took his wrist and he was sent to B side earlier and he had to pull a little bit more matches. And he said that, yeah, people still, he said that he pulled against a very professional athlete. And he said that he learned a lot of lesson from that match. Um,
SPEAKER_04: Which one do you think is better, Hermes or Prudnik? Hermes is better. He said Hermes would beat Prudnik. That's what Ferit is thinking. Anyways, guys, thank you very much. Ferit, is there anything you'd like to say to us? Thank you for all the questions. Thank you, brother. You made it so big. Which channel is this? Is this Zoom or YouTube?
SPEAKER_00: This is a YouTube channel. Yes, brother, I hope this series is your tournament. I want to come to good places in this tournament. I caught my form right now. I'm going up. I just said, I don't want to fight with someone, I don't want to fight with anyone, I don't want to fight with anyone.
SPEAKER_04: Yavaş yavaş ağırları yenerek iyileri. En son finali Levan'la yapmak istiyorum. Thank you everyone for the questions. And he said that, he says that he, I asked him, you know, who he do want to pull. He said at East versus West, he wants to win and continue winning. And he wants to do the last match against Levan. Not, not right now, but at some point, if he beats everyone.
SPEAKER_04: He said at some point he wants to do his final in his career against Levan. So he has a goal to do this. Anyway, so thank you very much, everyone, and hope to see you guys next time against, I mean, with someone else, another guest, I meant. Sorry for being a little bit tired.
SPEAKER_04: There is one more question here. What's Ferit thinking about the future of armwrestling will be? Do you think that in the future, people like Levan, even stronger people, will emerge? God knows, I don't know. Only God would know. He said he doesn't know anything about it. Andrea says good luck, Ferit is one of the most underrated bulls. Andrea gives you very good chances.
SPEAKER_04: Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, it will be at East versus West. Bye Shrek. Bye Engin Turbo. Take care guys. Take care. Thank you very, very much.
