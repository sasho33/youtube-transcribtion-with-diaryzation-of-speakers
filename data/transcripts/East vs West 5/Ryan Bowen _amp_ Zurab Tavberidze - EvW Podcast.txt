SPEAKER_00: all right how are you my friend oh good afternoon good afternoon sorry not good morning good afternoon and for you good evening correct yes um ah i'm busy mine is tired you know just trying to figure out everything what to do trying to cover the event and this hello adnan how are you my friend
SPEAKER_01: and yeah i'm very well i just got back from training um had a good group up tonight with a group of about 20 20 guys so yes it was good do you know how to make them my my uh screen bigger like like yours oh um are you what camera are you using your phone or your laptop on but there is some options on it but um
SPEAKER_01: Is your phone horizontal? Or is it vertical? Now? Sideway? Yeah. I'm not sure. Yeah, because yeah, Watson, that should make it like aspect ratio. Yeah, it's not filling the screen. And how do we record this? How do we record from more? Are we recording? Or are we going live? No, we go in live, but I also want to record so
SPEAKER_00: uh we make clips short clips oh yes um i i'm not certain off the top of my head i know that i mean if you can always download it from youtube um going down i think yeah um show me but i forgot how it was um yeah i'm not i'm not too familiar with zoom off the top oh yeah i found it i found it yeah it says record yeah oh yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's beautiful. Hello, guys. Hello, everyone. And so you said you had a training with training.
SPEAKER_01: yeah it's probably probably probably my last really hard hit out tonight um a little bit over two weeks away I had a group of about 20 guys tonight that were trading with all all big guys all big strong humans and um it was nice once I got it was table time right you're talking about yeah table time how did you find yourself
SPEAKER_01: I feel really good. I feel really amazing. I'm confident. I mean, I'm in my best shape ever. Tonight, I was getting it I was pulling everyone like there's a rap I was getting once once once the fatigue levels in people were kind of becoming apparent, I was gripping them very low and top rolling from there. So it was very I was making it very difficult for myself to top roll people. You are you are holding low grip. So you're making everything harder for your tornadoes.
SPEAKER_01: they can use their wrist i understand yeah yeah because i respect so much of what zurab is going to bring to the table that i'm i know it's gonna i'm gonna have to fight the urge to go into a hook um i'm gonna have to just stay persistent and just just get that outside no matter what yeah i mean for me it's not like about doing this because like it is you need to also cut the connection you know
SPEAKER_00: need to keep oh yeah yeah you also need to make his angle open so he can't put pressure this is not exactly his hand and wrist when you put in pressure his body is put in so once you turn here and roll here and then then you can even hit the wrist like this can still open so this is why to to me i mean to
SPEAKER_00: like putting pressure to his little finger, keep it far while keeping the pressure here. If you also turn his pronator and roll him out of angle, you know, I will tell also Zurab, because you are for sure underdog here. And I don't want, yeah, I will just openly say that, Zurab, I will be at the corner of Ryan Bowen, you know. Do you have a problem with that? I'm sure that you will not care.
SPEAKER_00: I think he will be so confident of himself that he can say that, you know, you can have John, Devon, Levan, Danny, yourself, all of you. And, you know, yeah, the Ryan corner, he will not matter. This is what he will say, in my opinion. Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. I look forward to it. What's that? I really look forward to it. I mean,
SPEAKER_01: might save some of this for when we're live i'd like him to hear it too uh but i but i genuinely believe that um he is the favorite he should be the favorite but one thing that comes with being the favorite is the immense pressure of being the favorite he is i'm pretty con pretty sure that he's he's been told by a lot of people that he not only should beat me but that he should crush me and uh
SPEAKER_01: if if when he grips me he can't sense that he's going to crush me if he can sense that it's a battle the mental pressure is going to skyrocket
SPEAKER_01: It's going to skyrocket. If he feels a battle, it's going to skyrocket. That's a tough place to be for anyone. When your mental pressure skyrockets, it's hard to perform. Although he's confident, if it goes even slightly towards a battle, he's going to be challenged mentally, I think. If it comes to that point, yes, for sure. But I don't think that he has
SPEAKER_00: Like he has, like my guess, slight pressure, not like, you know, real pressure because he's so confident of himself. And I mean, this is my opinion on it, my opinion. I know that you have, I mean, tools to be dangerous when you are in good shape, not the last time you showed up here. Can you tell us, you know, how much difference you think that,
SPEAKER_01: Uh, you have from last time that, uh, 89 kilo or something Ryan to this hundreds over 105 kilo Ryan. Yeah, like this, this is, this is 17 kilos difference. Uh, if we go in from my weigh in weight of, I think I weighed in at 88.7 kilos and, and tonight I'm 106 kilos. So there's a, there's a big, big difference. It's, it's, um, it's, it's hard to describe, uh, but.
SPEAKER_00: The version of me, I'll never do it again. The version of me that turned up at East-West-West 4 was a mistake to try to cut that far on weight. Yeah, it was not the right move. Can I cut your thing? Armless in Asia, that is actually a very bad match. And the only reason my friend and I are not going to buy this paper in the short, my friend, please, please, never ever buy
SPEAKER_00: east versus west pay-per-view never ever buy east versus west t-shirt and please if you ever see any east versus west match on social media please ignore and i will block you you'll feel relaxed i will feel relaxed i mean i am the last person to be threaded by not by pay-per-view i'm the yeah who was that who was that was that just that random idiot
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you know, it's a funny one when people, when a random individual tries to make a threat of, I'm not going to watch your stuff. It doesn't bother you, does it? Yeah, he's just coming here. Probably he's your hater. And then he is just, the people comes. Oh, if you do that, if you invite Devin, I'm not going to buy this anymore. If you invite this guy, I'm not going to buy that. I mean, come on. I mean, like, there are like,
SPEAKER_00: tens of 1000s of people who are supporting East versus West. But if someday, I respect the community, if they say, we are not going to support you. I mean, I would just go away, you know, to understand people are thinking that probably I'm a money guy or something. I am, of course, I'm worried to not to cover the event. But I'm not worried if you call me. Oh, again, you've muted it. You've been muted. Oh, yeah. You're back. Yep.
SPEAKER_00: yeah because if you got your uncle came so he gets cut you know and then when community i mean tells me that and you know okay we don't want anymore and then yeah i mean but it needs to be majority understand not not like you know one single kind guy with troll account comes and okay you set a match for ryan bowen and then i'm not gonna buy the event please don't buy you know i i honestly ask you something you and i we also have private chats yeah like
SPEAKER_01: Do you believe that I'm doing all this to make money, to become rich or something? Yeah, it's so far from it. You're doing it for the sport, the community. I know very well that you popped up and kind of saved the sport during the COVID period with this event.
SPEAKER_01: i don't i don't think i could correct me if i'm wrong but i don't think you actually intended on this being a ongoing thing and it just through service to the community you actually you've actually ended up here at east west five and and six and um and yeah it's it's it's been a way where you've actually highlighted so many names uh i know like you we shared it the other night
SPEAKER_01: i didn't even know who morozov was until he's first west like that's that's an honest thing and now he's a superstar like so you you've already brought out and uh highlighted athletes that wouldn't have otherwise been as widely recognized so yeah you're not doing it for the money i'm well aware because i know what the costs of all this are as well it's it's yeah whenever i treat a guy like this people should not make this like oh did you see what he needed to offend this is not to offend there are there are arm wrestling fans
SPEAKER_00: don't threat me like this, you understand? Like when Jerry was out, I mean, I didn't go for a cheap option. I went with Dave Chaffee. And then when Michael was out, I went for Devon. Devon versus Pruden alone, if you put even like not so many important matches, it could be papery by itself.
SPEAKER_00: And yeah, because we thought that was still was great. You know, even we thought that this card was the was the best one.
SPEAKER_00: compared to the old earlier ones. But I still added Devon here. You understand? I try to make the public happy. And then someone just comes here and then with his paper retread, if you have Ryan Bowman, I'm not going to buy that paper view. The other guy says, never invite Devon. You know, you have very high quality event. Devon is going to lower this.
SPEAKER_01: i mean what the hell are you talking about you know just like i mean what are you doing you know just come on just enjoy it i spoke to i i chatted with devin earlier today um and we were we were reflecting on how amazing
SPEAKER_01: the room is going to be and we were just talking about the names of people in the room and and I want to say as a fan just as a fan I I just go I said to myself present saplankov saganishvili larit uh Engen Terzi Gary Goodridge and I'm like I'm like like
SPEAKER_01: It's like a who's who of arm wrestling. It's like so many of the best that have ever been.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. It to me, it's like it's pinch yourself stuff that that that that all those arm muscles are in the same room together at the same time. It's, it's amazing. So yeah, what you've done is phenomenal. I take that all together. We do all together. Well, let's, let's encourage each other. Let's let's make our medicine bigger, better. Instead of just saying that, you know, like, if you do this, I don't do this. If you do that, I don't do that. You know, come on. Yeah, come on. I mean,
SPEAKER_00: He's not him. There is a super shed Sweden arm wrestling television. Thank you, Christian. Thank you for your support. East versus West five will be a big one day I will be in Turkey to see East versus West in person and to hang out with you guys. Anytime my friend anytime. We love you. Yeah. Darko. Thank you for your support, my friend. Thank you. We love you too. And
SPEAKER_01: um anyways i can see some i can see a question in there that i'd like to answer just looking through the comments so someone said engen asked us ryan if he genuinely believes he can beat zurab yeah um i i'd like to answer that question in in in the sense that
SPEAKER_01: i have i've been really consistent in the sport for 10 years in respect to how much of my life and energy i've poured into it and i know that i have continued to get more conditioned i've continued to get stronger and i've continued to get better i've always been leaning in leaning in leaning in and i feel like my consistency in doing that
SPEAKER_01: is constantly dragging my standard up and people put limitations on their expectations and people laugh at my own goals and whatnot. But I just know that I'm someone who won't stop leaning in. And look, win, lose or draw against Zurab, I don't go into this match with any expectation of a victory or a loss or anything. I go into this match with an expectation of performing at the best that I've ever performed before.
SPEAKER_01: And I'm super curious to see where that lands me. I think that if you do all the armwrestling math, clearly Zurab is the favorite. His achievements in the sport far outweigh mine. But you can draw straws, long, long conclusions to go, oh yeah, look, there's enough data there that Ryan's a shot at this. Stylistically, yeah, I have a shot. It's just a question of am I strong enough? Yes, yes. And as I'm saying...
SPEAKER_01: And as I've said, I know arm wrestlers say a lot that they're at their best. And I've said it many times as well. But never have I been more certain that I'm actually at my genuine best. With all the fundamental strength training that I'm doing at the moment, I'm 106 kilos. I've never been this weight before. I feel phenomenal compared to anything that I've felt before in respect to the way my training partners feel.
SPEAKER_01: So it's more of just an exciting moment for me to see whether this version of me is up to Zureb's standard. Win, lose, or draw, I'm excited to pull. I'm going in very fearless, very relaxed. And I know that that will produce the best performance. So do I have expectation of beating Zureb? No. Will I give it my best? Hell yes, I will. Will I be surprised if I get a victory? Um...
SPEAKER_01: i i'm a dreamer i i won't be surprised uh i'll be very happy but look if i don't get it oh good crack on um too good i'll shake his hand and say well done but that's kind of how my my mindset is going into this match yeah um ryan uh i was gonna say but i was
SPEAKER_00: too many things that you're playing yeah i was gonna say something there was a good question in my mind but um what was i gonna say i better not read the chat i i whenever i read it just like seriously um that's okay yeah like when i look at zurab when when you offered me all these uh i remember the question
SPEAKER_01: Just tell me, totally honestly, has there been any point that you regret accepting that match? Oh, not even slightly, Ege. No way. No, this is the sort of match that just feeds me. My mom and dad will tell you that I've been this type of person since I was a little kid. And what I refer to is the jump. I'm the jump in the deep end kid. I'm the kid.
SPEAKER_01: I'm the kid who, when I was seven years old, hassled the tennis professional pro that was running the tournament to let me play in the under 16s. Not because I thought I could win it, but I just wanted to play the best kids. I wanted to play the kids that were better than me. There's something about me that...
SPEAKER_01: I feel like I progress best when I jump in the deep end. So I live for these sorts of moments. And I love jumping in the deep end like this. I perform best, my best. Within myself, I've always performed far better against someone that I shouldn't be able to even hang with.
SPEAKER_00: than I do with someone that is perceived to be at my level. It lifts me when I play better people, big time. I mean, I don't even sound like a tennis player still. Sometimes I also make very quick decisions because of my personality. Later, I think that, oh, maybe that was not a good idea, but you need to back it because you already decided, you understand? And you decided, announced.
SPEAKER_00: and then now okay you have to do it you understand so i i thought that maybe it was like that you made a quick decision and then after the deep calculation because you know you and i we talk and suddenly you accept it you understand so what i'm just saying like maybe sometimes you think more clear and you're like okay did i make a mistake you know should i just
SPEAKER_00: continue you know with guys that you know like after losing uh ray i i pulled against uh bogdan stoika and then yeah and then you pull against khalid tired or not you know it was accepted match within the rules that you know was there you know so so like did i make a mistake you know like i was just going up here would it be going here again you know maybe i should just continue going
SPEAKER_01: by taking more like how to easier opponent like you know yeah no i i i again if if you could have been a fly on the wall to my childhood and you'd you know it's just i i don't know i feel like i am a little different that i i do pursue very uh happily within my my soul i happily pursue people that uh just
SPEAKER_01: reputation reality everything they're better than me I I just that my happiest place in sport is taking on the the guys in the division above me um always that's always brought the best out of me and I I there's no regret there's no hesitation there's no there's no moment of going oh what have I bitten off here um
SPEAKER_01: I'm really happy to be in this place. This will bring out my best performance. I'm certain of it. What would you do if you would go back four months ago? One, you wouldn't set that match. Yeah, I wouldn't have won the 90 kilos. Okay, so yeah. So I understand.
SPEAKER_01: if you would go back in time you wouldn't accept the pull ray yeah i i i accepted that match out of respect for the storyline that ray and i had like we've we've been parallel in the sport for a long time in terms of our uh our uh we've been back and forth there was a lot of we we saw a lot of value there in the uh the clash because of people just wanted to know who would win out of the two of us um
SPEAKER_01: So subsequently I thought there's a great story there. So I'll take that match and okay, I'll get to 90 kilos for it. I think when I accepted the match, I was probably 97 kilos. And then I dieted down to 93 before I got to Istanbul. And then I dehydrated from 93 down to 88.7 for Wayne. And it just, it cost me too much. I don't want to take anything away from Ray. Like at 90 kilos, Ray beats me every day of the week. I'll accept that.
SPEAKER_01: um but it did it did it did highlight to me that i'm no i'm no longer a 100 kilo i i wouldn't i wouldn't even accept the match at 95 kilos now i'd say no way um like i would be you'd have to twist my arm to get to 100 kilos um i'm really really happy mentally to just say i'm not going to the i'm not going to cut weight ever again i'm just
SPEAKER_00: I'm excited more so, Engin, by what I can achieve in five and ten years than what I can achieve this year. If Zurab is going to join us, yes, Zurab is going to join us. He said he will be a little bit late. He's waiting for his translator. And the Sweden Armisen Television has a question. Ryan has a narrow but possible shot. The real test, though, if
SPEAKER_00: ryan is strong enough to get past the arm lock of zurab this is what they are asking they are asking that um that like you may neutralize his wrist but will you be able to in his that's that's yeah i've recognized that as a sticking point when i prepare for a match i think about
SPEAKER_01: I go into my dreaming state and I imagine where all the sticking points are and all the various, and then I prepare for those sticking points. And certainly one of the sticking points is if the match is going well, and I would consider this match to be going well if we're here, that I've somewhat flattened or kept neutral his wrist, but I've then attempted to go sideways and it's just got stuck right at center.
SPEAKER_01: And I've seen him in that position against Ron and against John. He's got an amazing hold there and he can last a long time. So I've been preparing for that immensely, both in the gym and on the table. So I recognize that as an area that needs to be addressed. I've worked on my back pressure and side pressure in a pronated wrist position very, very heavily. I'm really happy with the numbers I'm moving in the gym sense.
SPEAKER_01: Technically, I think I'm very sharp in that situation. I think that I can move sufficiently to be one step ahead of Zurab on a technical level. Again, to me, it's just, do I have the horsepower and endurance to outlast him there? I think if the match does stop there, if it's going my way, it's going to be slowly coming towards a point where I'm going to look to transition to get my shoulder behind my hand.
SPEAKER_01: I won't be at any stage willing to go wrist on wrist with him. I'll be always staying above his wrist line, pronation high, and looking to press outside of his hand. If I'm losing the endurance battle of center, I know you don't like this, Zengen, but I'll definitely go to an open arm top roll defense if needed. It's not because I like it. There are rules.
SPEAKER_00: If your arm is, the humerus is down angle, then you will get a direct foul. There is a super chat. Rosie Benjamin is asking, Benjamin, or hello guys, Ryan, opinion on Sheffy versus Hermes and Devin Rudnick, glad for your match, Ryan. We will thank you for your super chat. We will go there when we talk, we finish talking about
SPEAKER_00: uh ryan and zurab at the end but now we want to talk about robin ryan ryan i have a question for you you used to pull yeah 80 kilo not long long long too long ago and like how does it happen that making 90 kilo made you so weak you know while you started 80 kilo i remember you were pulling in the door i truly started at 80 87 kilos 87 kilos was my first australian nationals very first australian nationals right
SPEAKER_01: Then I went down the path of thinking, okay, look, I want to be a national champion. I didn't think I could make it at 90 kilos then. So I dieted down and became an under 80 kilo puller. I won a few national titles at 80 kilos here in Australia, did well there. But then I recognized that I no longer liked making under 80 kilos. It was kind of the same situation that I'm in now.
SPEAKER_01: um dieting down to be in dehydrating down to be under 80 kilos i remember the last time i went under 80 kilos it was a it was a it was a diet and then a seven kilo uh dehydrate and i i think i nearly killed myself getting under 80 kilos that day like there it was terrible i spent six and a half seven hours in the sauna that day to get to under 80.
SPEAKER_01: So when people talk about me being under 80, it was never that I was walking around under 80. You were really... 87. 87 is where I started. 87 is near 90, yeah. So I understand.
SPEAKER_01: understand so and so now i'm 10 years in the sport so my my walk around weight like at the moment if i if i'm not force feeding myself my walk around weight is like 103 104. um so i've really put on 16 kilos in 10 years i have another one right whenever people talks about like god's ryan you know ryan versus levan on these kind of things you know like
SPEAKER_01: apparently they are just having fun but just how do you feel about this do you feel do you feel offended oh look it's honestly that all those comments have just become white noise to me now i like i think they're ridiculous i think like i don't even notice them they literally just fly past i just think uh okay cool yeah that joke again i see that joke joke 50 times a day uh it's it's i don't care about it in any way let me ask you let me ask you on the chat
SPEAKER_00: Who is the goat, guys? Just write here. Who is the goat? You will see now. Some will say John, but some will say Ryan. Maybe one out of ten guys will say Ryan is the goat. This is ridiculous. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't think it is toxic. I don't know. But they just, I don't know, like to tease you or something, you know. This is what I say, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: See, one vote for Brink, Ryan, Ryan, Ryan, and Ryan. But stop to be even says Ryan. See? You see?
SPEAKER_01: that's it and they look the internet that doing its thing and having fun like that uh look it's it's got its place it's got its place in in i recognize it and i actually value the fact that look the community the community helps helps me do my thing by by having fun like that so i i accept it is i think it is ridiculous in in in a reality sense obviously it's ridiculous um yeah but it's all born from the fact that
SPEAKER_01: that I I wear my heart on my sleeve when people ask me what's your goal in the sport Ryan and I say I want to be recognized as one of the all-time greats like by the end of this story I hope to achieve that so that I'm not I'm not afraid of saying that I'm not shying away from that like I've been in the sport 10 years I'm 37 years old I intend to be at it for the next 10 years as hard as I've been at for the first one so
SPEAKER_01: yeah so I I don't shy away from saying I hope to be an all-time great in the sport and so hence the ones that think that's impossible they enjoy having a laugh and enjoy calling me the goat because of it so yeah here's what it is yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's good that's good that you know I don't know where where um I don't know he said 10 15 minutes he will be late
SPEAKER_00: Probably his translator didn't come, or what happened? I asked him if we need a translator. He said he's going to come with a translator. So what to do? Since he didn't come yet, let's talk a little bit about the matches. Let's start. Since you are one of the guys who knows
SPEAKER_00: worldwide arm wrestling you know who is who you know so let's let's start uh adam worzinski and uh bojidar simeno how do you see that match
SPEAKER_01: I think that's Bojadar's match to win. I think he has the advantage of familiarity with the situation. I think Adam is someone who is full of promise from the USA. However, there has to be something said for stepping out of your comfort zone and competing on a stage on the other side of the world.
SPEAKER_01: that's something that takes familiarity. No matter who you are, we've seen plenty of champions go from their home ground to the other side of the world and struggle to perform to the level that they had anticipated. I've certainly felt that in my own performance. I've seen people like
SPEAKER_01: Ermes Gasparini go to the wal and struggle we've seen Americans come to Europe and struggle we see it often and I think this is one of those opportunities for Adam where he's full of promising uh he's coming to prove a point but I see this as as bojada's home ground and he's home ground in terms of familiarity with the referees with just the conditions and the pressures and all that uh I think bojada will win this one um
SPEAKER_01: i think i think he'll dictate i think he'll dictate terms and uh he'll he'll he won't be moved that far from center um he'll he'll get it to his his lane and then it'll be one-way traffic that's what i anticipate for this one you know chad sewers chad sewers yeah yeah he is coming together with adam to be at his corner as his trainer and yeah i am i kind of like that match
SPEAKER_00: will not be an easy match for Bojidar, I can tell you. And I'm not sure if he can win, but I see like a 50-50 match. I'm not seeing that, you know. What is Adam's weight? Huh? What's Adam's weight? What's Adam's weight at the moment, do you know? I think he's around 95 kilo, but the weight agreement was 92 kilo. We made the categories after we set these matches. So...
SPEAKER_00: Bozidar is about 85 kilos while Adam is about 92 kilos. He will be 92 kilos, but maybe on the competition day he will be around 95 kilos. So I think it will be... I have watched him, you know. He's very good. He's very good. He's very technical, incredible endurance. And he's not super fast, but once he stops the guys, you know, and Bozidar is not a super fast guy either, you know. He's not that
SPEAKER_00: flash spinner he just goes I mean he can flash pin too but it depends you know it depends on opponents and especially against the hook pullers top hook pullers you know always you know some battle there so let's see yeah yeah one guy said Bojidar not only pull off not long ago but also in Dubai tournament last week he may not be properly recovered I don't know about that because
SPEAKER_00: these guys when they are training they even train sometimes twice three times a day you know i know their trainings uh but i mean if it was next week the east versus west i would say yeah it's too close a week or something you know but when he has what three 22 days i think he will recover yeah that's funny yeah so another one justin bishop versus mindagua star ascites
SPEAKER_01: I have a question. How did you find Nindago's performance in England? In England? At Armours? I've got to make sure I don't talk about anything that hasn't been released yet. Which match? We've seen him pull Nanostad, haven't we? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so look, his pull against Nanostad was very impressive.
SPEAKER_01: He managed to chip away at the hand and wrist of Nanastad. It was very buckle-side dependent. Early on, it was just whoever had the buckle. But over time, the hand and wrist integrity of Mendoza came through and he was able to gain control on that buckle side. I think that this match with Justin will have a shape where...
SPEAKER_01: Justin Bishop has great back pressure and solid side pressure. And he's comfortable letting his wrist slightly go and then pronating through his thumb. I think that he's going to have to go there because I think Mindaugas will have the ability
SPEAKER_01: to take control of the hand and wrist if they're both low-hand top-rolling. I think Justin has a slightly longer forearm than Mendoza, but Mendoza just has really nice dragging back pressure. And I think that his familiarity, again, if we're talking whose home ground we're at, I think Mendoza has the edge there with referees and conditions. Like, Justin's a hard one for me to get the level of. What do you mean by saying referees?
SPEAKER_00: As in he's familiar with the referees? I'm not sure. East versus West is not as strict as Wofford.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I agree. Definitely not a streak, but even still, I don't know if Justin's ever had a start with the referee that will be there on the day, where Mendoza probably has. At least he's been in the room, and there's something to it. They're not huge factors, but they are factors nonetheless, familiarity with the referee. And I think that those things are in Mendoza's camp. Justin, for me, is a hard one to get a read on. He's had very...
SPEAKER_01: very pendulum results and what i mean by that is like if we remember justin's breakout performance that got him into the spotlight it was uh in the ual he beat janice amelans um over there in the usa and everyone was like wow look at this guy this the bama bull the real deal beating janice the way he did was very impressive um that was like in 2014 or 2015 or something like that um it was quite a while ago but he did amazingly well and then contrast
SPEAKER_01: He's going to be 82 kilos. Okay. And then the contrasting side to that is we've seen Justin struggle in Moldova. And again, I think Justin is someone who hasn't quite yet bridged the gap on...
SPEAKER_01: The, the Eastern arm wrestling conditions. He's very, very solid in American arm wrestling conditions, the wild west where there's a lot of load before the go. Um, Justin does very well. Uh, he's not so good with, with, with fast starts and, uh, and lacks lack of pressure in the load. So I think you've been dog is takes it, takes it to that style. I expect him to take control of the hand and wrist. I expect Justin to dig in.
SPEAKER_00: But I think, ultimately, Mendoza is the favorite in this match, if I had to pick sides. I understand, yeah. I mean, Justin, in fact, didn't do so bad at Moldova. When there, he lost directly. But he beat Viorel Dobrindev. I mean, he wasn't bad. Yeah, but Levon Saganashvili's liver. I think he's from your country. And in Ukraine, Prince of Coin...
SPEAKER_01: to East versus West if beat are there. Who is the prince of the coin? Who do you bring the prince of coin to East versus West? If beat are there. I'm not sure who the prince of coin is. I'm trying to work out this code. The prince of coin.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I can't work. I'm sorry, Levon. Second, this really is liver. I can't work that one out. And he's an Aussie too. Yeah. As you said, so I don't know. Look, uh, training with Lachlan has been fantastic. He's, he's been simulating for me, uh, the style that I'm anticipating to face. Um, so, uh, I'm very blessed to have had Lachlan in, in this preparation and, uh, yeah, excited. So sorry, Levon's liver. I'm not sure what the question was actually meaning. Um,
SPEAKER_00: this one i will only ask percentage not the detail because we talked about already ryan bowman versus rob uh look look look it's i i oh here here we go here's here's the man is as we're talking about it yeah yeah it's definitely okay definitely 100 tell us what it is can you turn the phone sideways
SPEAKER_01: connecting to his audio yeah yeah but look look whilst they're getting their audio sorted out um hello can you turn hello hello okay okay
SPEAKER_00: hello hello hello okay can you guys turn the phone sideways yep thank you so zurab you told me 10 15 minutes you will be late but you are 34 minutes late that means that means five millimeters higher as a penalty
SPEAKER_03: He can't open it. There was a ride that's invalid in the address in the Zoom. Okay, okay. Because Ryan Bowen thought that Zurab was scared and he already escaped. He changed his mind about competing.
SPEAKER_03: I was a little bit scared, but there we go.
SPEAKER_01: how are you feeling how are you feeling but are you are you i want to know are you are you feeling the pressure on this one has has everybody told you that you need to destroy me or are you where are you at with that
SPEAKER_03: He thinks there was a lot of pressure about this, what you said. And he thinks he will defeat you, Ryan. Very good. But there's pressure. I like that. I like that. Don't be scared right now.
SPEAKER_01: I'm winning the head dimensions here tonight, so I think that's good. They say that the head size means victory. Tawiyo didi gamikhtawo karuchewo da. Gargantz uznofo da. Tawiyo didi deyoso ze ari damukidebuli gamarjujwa ura. Ke khumra.
SPEAKER_00: okay please what was that again no can you translate you you said something you guys left but you didn't translate anything yeah uh the bowen said that's a head size matters meaning
SPEAKER_00: yeah this was a joke it just translated nothing said about it just love oh he didn't say anything okay okay okay yeah tell us that ryan may cancel the match if he doesn't if zulab doesn't take his legs away you know from the camera
SPEAKER_03: What are those things measure? What, what, what, what are they? What do they measure? What do they measure? The Ryan has growing the head. My hands are growing.
SPEAKER_03: and do it do you know what what is the rabbit's bicep measure this one doesn't measure oh 50 50 50 50 50 centimeters 50 51 centimeters yeah it's when when it's 20 20 but when it's pumped it's like a 90. can you tell him can you ask him in percentage
SPEAKER_03: What is his chance? What is Ryan's chance in percentage? But tell him honestly to tell us.
SPEAKER_03: I'm just reading the body language.
SPEAKER_03: For example, if you are a sports fan or an athlete, I would tell you that you are physically strong. And in this physical strength, I was able to win. Therefore, I can say that I was able to win by 10%.
SPEAKER_03: So Zurab thinks that's 100% of money his size and he will defeat without any...
SPEAKER_03: uh like a trouble uh but he also said that ryan bone is a very good uh sportsman uh he feels fight he he is a good bowler but uh wise from zurab he needs to get more strength physical strength because zurab thinks that he's a stronger and he can easily defeat
SPEAKER_01: I was just going to offer, if Zurab has a rematch with Chance Shaw, does he want me to coach him or it'd be in his corner? Does Zurab want me to help coach him how to beat Chance? No, no, no. One second, Ryan. I will add something. Ryan is asking if Zurab
SPEAKER_00: would pull with chan xiao who beat zurab before does zurab want ryan to be his coach because he asked this because he beat chance before i understand because now he said he's gonna win 100 so in a some circling way he's reminding him that hey i beat the guy that beat you so
SPEAKER_03: You understand? Now you can make the question. I understand, I understand. He will teach him the big sides of the show. Zura, how we are going to conduct the show? So, who in the end, I am going to host him. So, I am going to host him. So, I am going to host him.
SPEAKER_03: can you also ask him uh people are teasing ryan as ryan being goat you know what goat means yeah
SPEAKER_00: God, greatest of all time. And many people, I just made a, I asked this question and people who answered that the God is Ryan was more than the people who answered God is John Bersink. Does this make Zurab nervous?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, that's right. It's been a long time since Ryan Bowen and Jon Zenk met. He is from Guatia, right? Yes, he is from Guatia. Ryan Bowen is from Guatia, right? Yes, he is from Guatia. He is from Guatia.
SPEAKER_03: If many people say that Ryan Bowen is a god, he also will agree about his opinion. Does it make you nervous? Does he get scared? Ryan, you need to make this guy watch your matches
SPEAKER_00: know after the event and put this part of the chat on social media and remind him that he is laughing at you well every everybody knows everybody knows zengen that
SPEAKER_01: If you lose to me, it's a long time before that footage disappears. Just ask Evan Burgoyne how many times his match has been seen. So there's a lot of pressure. If you lose to me, it ends up being immortalized in the internet. So there's definitely pressure on anyone if they face me. Yeah, yeah. Can you tell this to him? Is there pressure on him? No, no, no.
SPEAKER_03: I would like to say that I am very grateful to all of you for your support. I would like to say that I am very grateful to all of you for your support. I would like to say that I am very grateful to all of you for your support.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, it's not a big deal, but it's a big deal for everyone because it's a big deal for me to be able to play with my team and play with my team. There is no chance for Ryan, as far as I'm concerned, to be able to play with a big team like Bialysti.
SPEAKER_03: Zurov just said if Ryan beats me, it will be great for Ryan and for society, for wrestling discussion, for everything, for popularity. I don't know what to say. Ryan is a good sportsman.
SPEAKER_03: It is ideal to use a technical weapon. In any case, it is necessary to have a physical weapon. A technical weapon is ideal.
SPEAKER_03: zora says that ryan's technical side is a perfect he's doing his technical side perfect uh but one uh one thing is that uh he's a stronger just with the strengths whole strength is stronger so he thinks that these strengths will be the main thing in this fight and can you also ask him how much
SPEAKER_03: more power does he think that Ryan used to get to beat Zurab? In percentage or? Yeah, percentage. Yeah, he thinks. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage. Yeah, percentage.
SPEAKER_03: If Ryan physically will be gained like twice, his whole physical strength, he will be at the same level.
SPEAKER_03: You won't have a choice.
SPEAKER_03: It's going. I am not training the wrist for you. I don't need the wrist for you. What are you training? One second, Ryan. One second. As a moderator, let me handle. One second. Can you ask him if he does 2-0 against Ryan in the round three? Just say in strap.
SPEAKER_03: Will he give his risks? So I have three
SPEAKER_03: Every type that I want to win, Ryan, one will be top roll, second one will be hook, and third one will be in triceps. You get a top roll in the first round. You top roll in round one. No way. You won't top roll.
SPEAKER_03: But if the audience is interested in what I'm going to do, I think that if the audience is interested in what I'm going to do, I think that if the audience is interested in what I'm going to do, I think that if the audience is interested in what I'm going to do,
SPEAKER_03: okay if everything goes good for zurab and he will beat like a 2-0 without any trouble to ryan in the third round he thinks he has no problem about giving rice to ryan and he thinks also that it will be very interesting and it will be good for the show
SPEAKER_03: i think i think he's saying that if i will be lose this much i will be disappeared from our wrestling
SPEAKER_01: you wouldn't be the first one that said that look you wouldn't be the first one I've made a few people disappear so just just be careful just be careful it's a bad bad thing but here's what I think is going to happen I think look if you're if you're crazy enough to try to top roll round one you're if you lose your wrist in that round you're going to be so out of position that you're going to blow up your arm I want to know
SPEAKER_03: in round one if you're out of position are you gonna fight and try to win ugly or are you gonna you're gonna pin yourself if you're out of position
SPEAKER_03: If you don't do this, you won't be able to win. If you do this, you won't be able to win. If you do this, you won't be able to win.
SPEAKER_03: if he will lose his position to try to control or something in the just fear sound he will fight absolutely with his full strengths because he's doing every much like this if he's losing or winning he's fighting like he's fighting from any position he's fighting
SPEAKER_03: Beautiful. All right. I guess I'm going to have to press you at the end. Beautiful. All right. I guess I'm going to have to press you at the end. Beautiful. All right. I guess I'm going to have to press you at the end.
SPEAKER_01: I'll be honest. That's the only way I can win. I'm not coming in here. There's no victory in there. For me, this one, two, oh, it's stuck. Endurance over here. Done. Yeah. Okay. I know.
SPEAKER_00: the width of that thing. Oh, it's huge, man. Looking good. Looking good. Are you awake, Engin? I am awake. I'm just waiting for you guys to finish. I don't know. So what I understand is
SPEAKER_00: round one zurab is gonna try top roll and then if he wins then round two he will try hook and if he wins both of them easily round three he's gonna give his wrist and then he will try to beat him that way is that good what about the king what about the king's move are you good what if if i go down into a king's move that is this is okay open top roll here
SPEAKER_00: Open top roll or desperation move? Desperation move is a foul. Open top roll is allowed. So he's asking about open top roll. He, by mistake, on my channel, calling it King's move, you know. Okay. Are you ready for an open top roll? That's what he called me. That's what he called me. I know Zura. I know Zura. I know Zura. I know Zura.
SPEAKER_03: In the first round, you played well. In the second round, you played well. In the third round, you played well. In the fourth round, you played well. In the fifth round, you played well. In the sixth round, you played well.
SPEAKER_03: Zura is changing his mind and telling that first two rounds will be the prize for Ryan and third round will be the wrist. He will give his wrist. Okay, first two rounds. Can you say again? First two rounds?
SPEAKER_03: first and the second round will be surprised for ryan she's not telling that yeah he will follow or he will hook and he drowned absolutely will be like he will give to ryan the question after he gives his wrist during the match can he recover or he's gonna beat him like this
SPEAKER_03: People are starting to understand. He said that people do three or four exercises with his wrist that he will win.
SPEAKER_00: i'm starting to understand why why you're gonna quit after this loss with all of this let's see let's see it will be it's getting i mean interesting and imagine that he's giving his wrist and getting exhausted
SPEAKER_00: And another question, Zurab, when I had Oleg Petrenko as guest on YouTube, I asked him, he said his chance with John Burzink 50-50 with right arm, but against you, he said he's clear favorite. What do you think about this?
SPEAKER_03: What do you think? Petrenko said that there is a big chance that he will help us. There is no doubt that Petrenko will help us.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think Petrenko's chances are high. I think it's 50-50. Zurab thinks that Petrenko and his chance to win is 50-50 also. It's like Brzezinski and Petrenko's chances.
SPEAKER_01: I feel like you should have pulled Petrenko first because you're going to be so, so crushed and your mood is going to be so low that you're not going to be able to get up for Petrenko. I feel bad. You should have had him first. You would have had a better chance.
SPEAKER_03: We're first up, aren't we, Engin? We match one, yeah?
SPEAKER_00: First match because Ryan will be commentating so he needs to commentate and then yeah we thought that he would be very good after he beats you he will just go and commentate the matches.
SPEAKER_01: I have one more question for you, Zurab. I look at your beard and I see a little bit of red in there. Do you identify as a redhead or not?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_03: Zulab thinks you both have the same beard. He says yes, he's a redhead? Not quite. He's like a blonde. Strawberry blonde, okay. That's okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. I was gonna, I was gonna, I thought we, as I, I have a quest of becoming the world number one ranked ginger. So I just wanted to know whether I was crossing one off here or not. Okay. Yeah. I know. And Jerry too, apparently. Oh, Jerry too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so, so let's talk about some other matches. So I will ask the opinion.
SPEAKER_00: And there is a super chat from Dizzy Das. Thank you for your super chat, my friend. Thank you so much, Engin, for all these amazing events you keep putting together. I am so, so grateful, legend. Thank you, my friend. Thank you for your support. Again, I will repeat, I'm organizing these events because of the people like yourself who are grateful, and I am also grateful to you guys for the support. So we do this all together.
SPEAKER_00: So let's, we were talking about the first matches. I'm not going to ask Zurab about the, some American guys that he probably doesn't know much like Adam Wojcicki and Justin Bischoff, but I will ask, like, for example, let's start from if, first of all, can you ask him, will he be objective about the Georgian guys or he will be,
SPEAKER_03: looking at the subject from, you know, as a Georgian guy. Can you ask him? At least we will know this. Okay, okay, I will ask. Zura, do you think that the Americans will be able to do the same as the Americans? I mean, I don't know if they will be able to do the same as the Americans, but I would like to ask you one question. Do you think that the Georgians will be able to do the same as the Americans? Zura, do you think that the Americans will be able to do the same as the Americans? I don't know if they will be able to do the same as the Americans.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that supporting
SPEAKER_00: attracting every georgians is their friends but he will be objective in this okay then let's start samushia versus daniel prokopchuk in percentage look at the video he's showing you how he beat chen shou
SPEAKER_01: ryan bowman is beating chancellor in the video what's his list what's his listing 20 years ago hey uh okay everyone everyone tells me the chance sucked when i beat him you know chance one month before i faced him beat nick zinner and brent rackers i'll just remind everyone of that
SPEAKER_03: Don't mention Coach Ryan. That never happened. Do you remember Ryan's movies?
SPEAKER_03: do it i don't want to i don't want to remember it anymore that was that was 18 kilos ago let's talk about zamusha and prokopchuk
SPEAKER_03: Samushiyam in the quarterfinal, in the quarterfinal in Marjana Khel, with a weight of 35 kilos, ZZ Samjer won the championship. Daniel Prokopchuk in the quarterfinal with a weight of 35 kilos, who was damaged in the final, and now he's in the final, he's in the second place.
SPEAKER_03: The objective would be to give 90% of the company to Namduilat, because Namduilat is a priority. The company will grow in the future, and the company will grow bigger with Daniel and the company. 90-90% of the company will be given to Namduilat. This is not subjective, Namduilat is objective.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, he's telling that Samushya had so many titles, he won 80 kilos or 85 kilos world championship. 75 kilos also and for this moment Samushya is looking bigger and stronger and he thinks that the percentage to winning this match will be like 80-85% to Samushya.
SPEAKER_01: And Ryan, how do you think this? I lead that side as well, David. I think we'll win it. I just feel like he is the bigger framed competitor out of the two.
SPEAKER_01: As much as I respect Prokopchik, his defense is amazing. His supernated side pressure is truly world-class and legendary. But I think Samashuria's offensive surge is going to be too much. And I think he'll open him up and get through. Ultimately, I think he should win. He should win in my eyes. Anyways, I missed a super chat from Cobra. Cobra said, arm sports, legendary Cobra, one of the best pounds for pounds.
SPEAKER_00: arm master in the history. And oh, the weight limit Josh is asking is 85 kilo, my friend 85 kilo. Prokopchuk said he will be around 82 kilo and Samush is going to be 85 kilo. And so another one. Wagner Bortolato versus Gyorgy Dizerano with left arm Zurab.
SPEAKER_03: How do you see the match, Ryan?
SPEAKER_01: Look, Zoranoff is one of the guys that I don't have a lot of data on. I feel like Wagner is a beast left-handed. He's very fiery. We know that he's got the press if it comes out. I feel like Zoranoff is the favorite. To be honest, when I look at his company, he came off, when was he won the WAF title? Two years ago, was it? 2019.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know what's done between them. After that, he pulled some super matches in one event in Siberia or something. I forgot. He's a great armwrestler, for sure. He's a great armwrestler, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I feel like he's got a high posting style. I feel like I feel like he's static set up. It's going to look at the end of the day, they're both killers. I don't know who's going to go get the edge on this one. So I'm reluctant to pick either side. I understand. GP, why do you time out Silky Winky? I mean, anyway, so how
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to ask again, Georgian, Revas versus Morozov. Revas is very progressive. He is very active and very active. Morozov is a new player. He is a very active player. He is a very active player.
SPEAKER_03: he is saying that there was a lot of progress with the weights he's getting stronger and bigger and morozov also is a young and the time is going going and he's also growing very strong and he thinks there will be a 50 50 percent so he had no like a pay for it
SPEAKER_01: this one for me is interesting because i i've i've kept my eye on um just where the markets are at and i've noticed that that rivaz is simply the the favorite in the eyes of the people that are yeah that are that are placing bets anyway um so i don't know that that's the case like for me instinct told me that uh morozov was going to be the the favorite when i think of morozov's performance against dave chafee um as his last right arm performance that was
SPEAKER_01: That was pretty spectacular. I rate Dave tremendously high. I put Dave above Rivas. So the way Morozov dealt with Dave was super impressive enough for me that I think Morozov is the favorite going into this one. That said, Rivas has a great set of tools on him. Very tall arm wrestler. And I have heard people...
SPEAKER_01: from the Georgian camp speak incredibly highly of him, saying that he is someone that could become one of the Levan type level guys. So I feel like there's prospect and promise in him that he could really be the top guy. But I feel like Morozov is the favorite based on most recent performances. And Zulab, Sandris versus Matt Mask.
SPEAKER_03: I think that matmaski will be very important and matmaski will help you to get better. Matmaski will help you to get in shape. If you don't do it right, you won't be motivated and you won't be able to achieve your goals.
SPEAKER_03: uh so matt musk was a week at the previous event so he had a lot of motivation and for this time he's in the shape so he will win matt musk will win that man will beat sundries yeah and and how do you see that yeah look look look it's a it's a it's a pretty brutal match uh i i give sandras the edge in terms of his
SPEAKER_01: His technical discipline, I will say that Matt Mask is a very, like the name suggests, the wild horse. He's very frantic. He will hit and hit and hit and sometimes be prone to make errors. I feel like Sandrus will be very rock solid and looking to protect his pronator very, very strongly. I think Matt Mask is the favorite in the early rounds and Sandrus is the favorite in the later rounds. It could go either way. I couldn't pick the winner.
SPEAKER_00: I understand. And do you know where is Zurab? I believe he is trying to somehow get out of the match. He's a little nervous. He saw my likes before. Is he nervous? He's scared of Ryan? Yes. Oh, okay. Tell Zurab that he doesn't
SPEAKER_03: I have to pull Ryan. I mean, if it's too much stress for him mentally, then tell him that I can cancel the match. I can find him a weaker opponent. Okay, I'll tell you. Zura, I was very nervous. I was very stressed out. I thought I was going to die. You were on the phone.
SPEAKER_03: He's connected with the iPhone. Tell Ryan that I am not your friend. But if I will lose with him, it's right.
SPEAKER_03: Ryan, do they get cut to you as well? Like, do they? Yeah, dropped out. Dropped out just a good bit. I don't know. What did he say? I don't know, because your internet is bad. The Zura says he's not afraid of Ryan, but if he will lose the match with Ryan, it's very frightening. He's afraid of Levard, man. So if he loses to me, he's worried what Levard will do to him.
SPEAKER_03: What did he say? He's just saying nothing. He's sure that he will win.
SPEAKER_00: yeah but when he is saying that he's gonna give his wrist or something i mean does he not think that it is a little bit dangerous because once his wrist goes like this and if he cannot finish and then later rounds may go the same way because he's exhausted and then everything turns like a nightmare he's not gonna do it when when we when we touch hands for the first time
SPEAKER_01: And, and he feels that it's a match, all of this will disappear. But the problem is he'll remember it in the back of his head and he's going to start imploding under pressure that he's put on himself because he doesn't want Levon to kick him off the Georgian team after he loses. So he will, uh, he, all of that won't happen. He'll fight hard. He'll fight hard because he'll have to. Right. Right.
SPEAKER_01: You are thinking that he will never come to this point because he will not be 2-0 again. I intend on forcing him to that point. I'm saying he won't be gifting anything. He'll fight as hard as he can. I'm certain of it.
SPEAKER_03: Sura, first of all, I would like to say that there was no risk of losing the match or losing the match. It is not possible to lose the match and win the second or third round. You can also say that you lost the match from that position.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's very important. What do you think about this? I think it's very important. You know, when you go to Magyarom, you go to Bursola, you go to Midi, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola, you go to Bursola,
SPEAKER_03: I think it's not a problem because it's not a problem. If you're a big guy, you can do it in one round. Then you can do it in a round. I think you can do it, but you can't.
SPEAKER_03: okay that's the end is uh the questions uh zura is answering that if he will like lose this one round when giving the wrist uh he has a lot of stamina and a lot of power so ryan also will be like lose his power when he will pull
SPEAKER_03: from this side too and uh he believes that it's no problem if one round he will lose the second round he will like him be more power he will have more power on the next round because he has a lot of endurance endurance yeah and silky wilkie is asking a super chat five million percent mad mask
SPEAKER_00: for the win, turn and burn. Do you think Matt can do a flop press? This question just confused me. If Matt Mask is going to win 5 million percent, then why would he need to do a flop press? Because, I mean, that's not where he is best, you know. Andy Beckett, thank you for your super chat. Keep up these great streams, Engin.
SPEAKER_00: We appreciate you. Thank you, my friend. I appreciate your support as well. And so let's see if that is okay. So we continue. We continue. We talk about draft. I'll simply say that Matt Mask has flop-pressed Devin in rounds in Supermatch before. So he does have a flop-press. If he needs it, he's got one. Yeah, I understand. But, I mean, Sander has so much horsepower. I don't know about that one.
SPEAKER_00: Um, and when are you going to compete again? When I'm ready, my friend, I just started to, and after this live, I will just go and train. And so anyway, so let's, let's throw something, uh, even more exciting. Dave Chaffee and Hermes Gasparini. Zurab, just stop doing this. Your arms like, like legs, you know?
SPEAKER_00: just open and open and what's the the guy is gonna see that's also terrible too you put this way that way whatever you put your arms are too big you know yeah he's also yeah tell him tell drop that ryan is text messaging me he says you know i want to cancel the match you know i want to cancel the match
SPEAKER_00: Don't kill yourself, Engin. I would never do such a thing. Yeah, don't kill yourself. Yeah, I know. I know, Engin. Anyway, what do you think about Zurab? Dave Chaffee, Hermes Gasparini. Dave Chaffee. Dave Chaffee. Lalit Intangible.
SPEAKER_03: Can you guys use only one phone together? You are in the same home now?
SPEAKER_01: and be together because your voice is coming from two different. I think I think I think perhaps one of you guys has YouTube playing at the same time, maybe something. I don't know. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: No, not about YouTube only. They are in the same home now, in the same apartment. So whenever they talk, we hear also from the other side as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I gotcha. Anyways, maybe you answer because the connection is now... So for me, this match is a pretty... Obviously, it's one of the biggest matches of the card. I think that...
SPEAKER_01: In the early rounds, I think Dave Chaffee's side pressure, I think Dave Chaffee's hand and wrist is going to be sufficiently solid in the early rounds that he's going to be able to utilize his dominant side pressure. I think Hermes will acknowledge that Dave has more side pressure if the hands are balanced. I think early rounds, we're going to see Dave
SPEAKER_01: get away with an early lead. But I believe that Hermes has a very efficient ability to continually put bullets and a lot of work into Dave Chaffee's hand and wrist. And I think we're going to see the pendulum start to swing. Now, where that pendulum is when it swings may determine who wins the match. I suspect round three, the classic Dave Chaffee round three fade is going to happen again. And his hand and wrist will be compromised round three. And I think Hermes round three and four will probably take it.
SPEAKER_01: then to me it gets interesting because by round five i think that uh the back pressure of ermis is going to be somewhat fatigued uh despite taking the hand and wrist there's still going to be work into his bicep um and that newfound flop press confidence that dave chafee has that we saw against vitalio and the uh king of the table i think he'll he'll hit that in round five um
SPEAKER_01: So I think it's going to come down to the wire. And it's going to be a flop press from Dave up against the defensive top role of Hermes in round five for the win. So you are saying Hermes is going to win? No, I'm saying Dave with a flop press 3-2 in round five. Oh, Dave, Dave. Okay, okay. Sorry, sir. I was looking at the chat. And what did you say? We didn't hear Zurab's answer, you know, because your internet was bad.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, Zurab said that Dave Chaffee beat Laletin and Chaffee for this moment is in good shape. So if he will fight like he fought with Laletin, he is a favorite.
SPEAKER_03: And also he... And also he...
SPEAKER_03: Now he knows how to fight with the top rollers, you know, as he did with Laletin. So if he will try this with Gasparini too, he is a favorite. I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Silky Wilkie, thank you for your super chat, my friend. Will Hermes be able to stop Dave's hit in the center or on the losing side?
SPEAKER_00: Just.
SPEAKER_01: Ryan, do you think that round one, it will start and Dave has a side... Round one, Dave will go sideways and his wrist will go backwards just as he pins Ermi's, is what I feel is the most likely scenario. Ermi's will have a very... It will be on the winning side for sure. You are saying Dave will be. I think it'll go Dave's side of center for sure, off the go. I think Ermi's hand will be forced into a defensive low hand top roll.
SPEAKER_01: and dave will probably like i said in him just dave's wrist will crack but it's dave's back pressure he'll be close enough to his to his hand that we'll get through um but if either man's if ermy's wrist
SPEAKER_01: in the early rounds, then it's a whitewash. Dave will win the whole thing. But if Ermi's wrist stays solid and Dave pins him with his wrist back, then we're going to see a down-to-the-wire match. I understand, yeah, yeah. And SilkyWilkie, thank you. One more super chat. I have the same long sleeve shirt as Zurab, except when I move my arms, the sleeve don't rip off. Can you tell me?
SPEAKER_00: I'm not gonna try that. Yeah, do you realize that Ryan is not looking at you like I mean to the camera, you know, just like where they... Yeah, I can't match that pose. He's looking at the microphone, he's looking around like that.
SPEAKER_03: i said this is the measurement that matters this one it's a psychological pressure for ryan yeah he's trying yeah uh it is interesting that zurab needs such thing i was thinking he was more confident
SPEAKER_03: He thinks he needs that pressure also. And Sho needs this, yeah. Keeps you alive. So he's preparing Ryan
SPEAKER_00: uh for what's gonna happen he doesn't want the shock so he's just getting in his head with this so that you know he will realize already slowly accept so he will not be a shock for ryan okay i understand is
SPEAKER_03: All I'll say is your head looks very small on that angle. It looks very small. He's saying that his strong and favorite subject is hands and he's not saying that
SPEAKER_00: Okay, okay. John Brzenk has a massive head. Just remember that. Okay, so let's talk about Devon Laratt and Evgeny Prudnik. Zorab. Laratt. Devon wins, Devon. Devon wins.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah? Yeah. They will win. 100%. 100? Wow. Win. Wow. Interesting. Wow.
SPEAKER_03: That's a very cool ball. Because if you know that Rudnicki is going to be a big hit, you know that Lara is going to be able to create some kind of impact and help the team. It's very important.
SPEAKER_03: So Larath has a lot of endurance. He's very strong and if he will feel the big pressure from Prudnik, he can do many types of like hooking, king small. He has a big experience, so he thinks that Larath is a favorite and he will win 100%. I understand. And so let's start right.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think it's a far more balanced match than that. I think that these guys are way closer. There's a factor that Devin is cutting weight for this. Devin's got to drop, I don't know, four to five kilos or something like that. So there's that factor that he's coming in with a bit of a cut. Again, he's coming in happy and fed. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: also if both these guys very technically well-rounded I think they're they're amongst the best technical arm wrestlers there that compete in the world today I I say Evgeny has the edge on explosive offense and Devin has the edge on defense and endurance I think that um
SPEAKER_01: I think that for Evgeny to win, I don't think that he can just flash pin. I think that he has to hit the position and have Devon extended.
SPEAKER_01: and then play the endurance game from there. I think Devon will have the ability to stop the match for sure. I don't see any flash pin routes at all. So I think it's going to be a stopped match. We're going to look at a technical war. If it's a neutral stop, if they stop dead center, then it's Devon's. But if the stop is with Devon open, then I don't know who wins.
SPEAKER_01: But yeah, both, I think it could be an amazing match. Both guys are so well-rounded technically that we could see, we could see, even within the same round itself, we could see the match go from inside to outside multiple times. I think it's going to be a spectacular match. Yeah, I talked today with Brutnik. Just to remind you guys, Brutnik was, he weighed 107 kilos when he pulled Tatachins.
SPEAKER_00: and now he's about 115 kilo and devon that people are talking and levan is talking was very near 130 kilo no 125 kilo what's that yeah about yeah 280 probably yeah yeah yeah and and so he's going down to 115 kilo and i don't think and i ask
SPEAKER_00: I said, like, are you stronger than when you practice with Devon? And I said, are you going to beat him? He said, yes. And this was like a private talk, not to intimidate anyone or something, you understand? So he believes he's going to beat Devon Arath. You know, he's not only
SPEAKER_00: um i don't know he's not looking only for a match with devon lara he's looking forward to beat uh devon yeah both these guys incredible technical they'll both they'll both fight for the setup i hope the referees just let let this match uh
SPEAKER_01: be everything that it can be in the sense that let the setups run because I think both these guys are very good at taking stuff from their opponent in a setup and I want to say I as a fan of the sport will enjoy watching that setup battle as much as the ready go and beyond I think that the grip negotiation is going to tell us a lot and both of the guys masters at it they'll hide what they're doing very well
SPEAKER_00: they neither neither man will start unless they're confident that they've got the lane uh secured so that in itself is very exciting as well yeah mario she says that he weighed 107 but water cut didn't he say he was under 12. i don't know but on the the day of the competition when i asked he said he was 110 kilo but and if you are thinking that the water cut is not affecting anyone
SPEAKER_00: it's power you are wrong my friend the water cut is affecting your power and he was not 112. he told me personally he was under 10. he said 112 probably with the clothes and everything you know i don't think he was naked under 10 kilo anyways does devon silky wilkie thank you for your super chat my friend does devon have good flash pin power he did to john but maybe he wasn't expecting it at that time no he doesn't really have that
SPEAKER_00: unless his opponent is exhausted. Um, I don't know. He's much stronger than his opponent. Um, he did to John in the last super match, but it was after the round one, John was already done, you know, after round one, maybe, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. We will see. And, um, so that, that is very interesting match in that, that this story is also very interesting, right? That, um,
SPEAKER_00: You know what, what happened that, you know, I, um, like everything that, that some people are thinking that there was a, like a makeup story or something. It is not. He wanted to pull his family out. It wasn't a good idea. And then we put some pressure.
SPEAKER_00: And he decided not to come. But at the beginning, he wanted to. He told me. I didn't offer him the match. And then after he denied the match, he still wanted to come. But he wanted to do both, like with his son after the surgery, take care of him. And he wanted to just jump into play and come on the competition day, like four hours before his match.
SPEAKER_00: And I said, yeah, 14 hour flight, you're going to have jet lag and then time difference because of the like, you know, day night thing, you know, he said, no, I don't care. I'm going to come and I'm going to beat him. And then there was another option, which was to change the date of the surgery. And finally, they had a date that everyone is happy now.
SPEAKER_00: He's going to be with his son and spend even some more days, you know, after the surgery. And then he's just going to come in time, rest well, and then compete. And yeah, it's incredible. But the guy is seriously, he's crazy. He's crazy. Like, I mean, I would never, never, ever like do such thing, you know, maybe when I was young. Yeah. But now traveling 14 hours and then the time difference.
SPEAKER_00: And then four hours before the match you arrive, you will still have like near one and a half hour from airport to, you know, venue. And then you will just jump up to stage and pull someone like Brutnik. And it's just crazy, you know, but he was going to do that. So that moment I realized that when people are saying that, oh, he's scared of this, scared of that, you know, I kind of disagree with that one. You know, that kind of convinced me big time that the guy is crazy.
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so there is another match. Morozov versus Ermes Gasparini with left arm. Morozov. Morozov with Gasparini. Morozov wins. Morozov wins. He didn't see, he didn't see even his countryman Rewaz favored against Morozov. So it means that Zurab is
SPEAKER_03: a lot intimidated by morozov's power this is this is what i am thinking yes it's right i'm going i'm going with with uh hermes on this one because
SPEAKER_01: Just like in this match with Zareb and I, top roll is for smart people. So top roll for the win. Yeah, but Morozov also knows how to top roll. Yeah, but Hermes is the more pure top roller. So top roll for the win. You know, what is my concern about that match? Whenever Morozov tried to top roll,
SPEAKER_00: uh tobias in february he couldn't and then he grabbed him low and hook him and beat him but now i know that he has an injury here that's why he couldn't go inside with david that he can so he had the only top role and so his only option is outside now there is no other option so he will be for sure
SPEAKER_00: couple versus topple as you say but about the outcome i don't know i don't know how good uh hermes's wrist because we at the professional arena the only match we saw him was against wagner bortalato who is going you know this way not the top row so we i really do not know how good hermes's left wrist is
SPEAKER_00: compared to his right, because I know that Morozov's left is nowhere any less than his right. So that is, I don't know. Because his right is at the level of, you know, you saw with Dave Chaffee and some others, you know. So if his left is around there, Hermes' left is at that level.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know about that. There is another super chat. Silky Milky, thank you again. Hermes seemed injured versus Bortolato. And I think Morozov will give more of a strain. Hermes was hurt a little bit, but he's totally fine right now. Totally fine. I chat with him almost every day. His arm is totally fine. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: And which match? Oh, Pauline. Pauline versus Irakli Gamtenadze. Because Pauline pulled some shit. Now we have 95 kilo limit. 95 kilo limit and Pauline against Gamtenadze, I think.
SPEAKER_03: If you compare the weight of Pauline and Samusha, you can see that Pauline weighs 1-2 kilos more than Nagleb Sportsman. And Gantenadze weighs 90 kilos.
SPEAKER_03: The European champion is in the second place, the overall prize is two. Iraklis has a weight of 99.8 kg, 10 kg, about 5 kg, and Chava has a weight of 99.5 kg. It is not subjective to say that Gantenadze has 3% of the minimum weight in the world, which is Iraklis' 3%.
SPEAKER_03: The 60% for Irakli as well. He's a European champion, he's a world champion and his mass is bigger than Samushia's mass. And when Pauline had a battle with Samushia, it was a weak battle for Pauline. So he thinks that Kamtenadze will win and there will be 60% for Kamtenadze.
SPEAKER_01: and it's objective what's that it's a it's an objective opinion of europe i don't i don't know enough about uh how do i pronounce that one yeah i'm gonna get it wrong i'll just say iraqli um i i don't know enough about him to to to know uh how this match is gonna go in a percentage sense uh paul lynn i will say of him
SPEAKER_01: But I think he's still finding his feet, and I think he's going to put in an even better performance this time around. And when I say finding his feet, I think he's an incredibly diligent professional, very committed to bettering himself, and I think he'll be sharper this time than he was against Samashuya. So I think that it'll be a good match. If Zurab is saying it's a 60-40, I think...
SPEAKER_03: it's going to be closer to 50 50 because i i think paul will be uh a better version than he was against david uh
SPEAKER_03: Freak of Minds is my favorite. I think Pauline is very good at sports, but she is the world's favorite. Objectively speaking, she is very objective.
SPEAKER_03: his objective opinion is pauline also a very good arm wrestler he's also very strong he believes that he's in better shape for now as he was uh with the david but uh anyway iraqli is a stronger he has many titles world champion experience world champion he's a world champion right
SPEAKER_00: So I think that Irakli is a favorite in this match. I understand. Isaac Gomez, thank you for your super chat. Ask Jurab's opinion about Brzing and Petrenko. Yes, I will ask. Jurab, John Brzing and Oleg Petrenko coming to the final.
SPEAKER_03: John Brzezinski, who played with the Hungarians, was the first to play in the national team, and I think this shows that the Hungarians did not lose. In the first round, the Hungarians played very well.
SPEAKER_03: okay the john zanker had the many uh matches before he hooked with uh so he was typed and because of this he had no um endurance with this much but first round we all see that he won too much yeah
SPEAKER_03: And now he's relaxed, he's in good shape and he thinks that John will win this match without a percentage. His opinion is that John is a favorite and he will win.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Right. Let's go. Yeah. John always just finds a way to win. Um, every, everyone you match John with, you always, you just know that John has the right set of tools to evolve, to be able to be one step ahead. And, uh, and I think that this is a case again, a young Petranco with an immense side pressure, um, uh, aggressive risk selection.
SPEAKER_01: Um, I think John will be able to put a stop to that and win the long battle. I think, I think the, the, the combination of John's wrist flexion and pronation will have ultimately flattened, but drink his hand. When I think back to the way Raymond's Antonovic, uh, came close against Petrenko when he last pulled a super match. I think that John is, is that plus more? Um, I think John takes this one. I understand. And, and.
SPEAKER_00: Zorab, you don't know Cobra, you don't know Haydar? This is the legend. Cobra and Haydar. But they are... He knows. What's that? He knows? Okay. Do you have any opinion about this match? I usually don't ask so much because people haven't seen them recently.
SPEAKER_00: Because they both quit arm wrestling long ago. They are just making a comeback. So it is hard to predict, hard to talk about it. They both are, in my opinion, legends. Cobra is an international one. But how do you, do you have any opinion about it?
SPEAKER_03: I don't want to say that he was a sportsman, but I think that Cobra was a legendary international athlete. I think that when you look at the history of Shesabami,
SPEAKER_03: Kobra is going to be an important player and he will be able to play from a different position. I think Kobra will be able to play from a different position, he will be able to play in the top role, he will be able to play in the top role, and he will be able to play in the top role.
SPEAKER_03: uh he's saying that as an event is coming cobra will be prepared for this much uh also he is saying that he saw many videos of cobra and he's saying that he can fight with any position he can top roll he can hook he can almost everything but yeah but okay
SPEAKER_03: He's a he's a favorite coverage favorite. Does he does he know? Web here some currency. Here's some kind of a tradition. They are friends. They are friends. Yeah. Yeah. Does he ever tell him about Haider?
SPEAKER_03: Do you want to say something about the fact that you are an athlete? No, I don't want to say anything. I've been watching your videos on the web, and I know that you will tell me how you used to play and what kind of sportsman you were. On the web, right? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's saying that Engin better now, how the sportsman, how his adversary was Webkija, but he don't tell. Haidar has defeated Webkija in, let me finish, 1998 Waffles in the final and 2000 Europeans in the final. Haidar has defeated Webkija Samparazze in both events. Twice, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Twice, twice. I think they only met twice. They didn't meet other than that. Haidar is older than Webkhia? How old is Webkhia? 47, 48.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, Haidar is about seven, eight years older than him. Haidar is 56 years old. He is 56 years old. Haidar is 56 years old.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, it is true that the category of great sportsmen, who have reached the top of the world, are all of the same era. The greatest sportsman, who will win the first place, has one career in PIK, and the second career is in the team of Akhvamloubi. There is no doubt that he is a great athlete. He can do anything.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I don't know. I don't know if it's a good thing or not, because it was the peak of his career. It was the beginning of his career.
SPEAKER_03: okay the many athletes many are monsters when they are growing up with their careers uh there are some who had his prime and he's like a shining he's winning everything but uh they are the another one is on their own you know they are growing growing growing to be also their pride so no no i either be right here in webcast prime that's why that's why they were in the final
SPEAKER_00: either was first there would be there would be first place that was not true what he says is not the fact so you know better no no what i'm just saying that if a guy is not he's in prime he wouldn't be in the final of his love so
SPEAKER_00: Webkia won his first world championships in 1994, WAF wars. And then also he won in 1996 WAF wars. At that time, it was like from 90, midnight 90 to end of 2000, his prime. So this match has happened in 98 and 2000. So they were in Webkia's prime. He can be sure about it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: The fact is that Haidar was better for this moment. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, what I'm just trying to say that he doesn't know about Haidar. So the best way to describe who Haidar is, so that is why, but this also,
SPEAKER_00: In the same year, Haidar beat Vecchia, the Europeans, 2000. Same year, the Walls was in America, and Georgians didn't come. And there, the final was Cobra and Haidar. And there, Cobra beat Haidar. Hey, Ryan, these are information for you. Just write down.
SPEAKER_01: sorry i'm getting sleepy okay i've been trying too much yeah yeah it was the last one and then very short opinion from you hyder cobra any any idea probably you don't know hyder at all you know i don't i don't know hyder but i've spoken to cobra a bunch of times about this match and all i know is that he is very motivated cobra is very motivated to uh not just return like i think like he
SPEAKER_01: He believes that he can not only just win this match, but go on and win the world title at his weight again. So he's lining up everyone. So I think that I'm looking for Cobra to just come out with crazy aggression. I respect Haida, no doubt. I don't know the man.
SPEAKER_01: But I know that they've met in worlds, as you guys have discussed, and there's a history there between them. But I'm excited to watch it because any time Legends step back on the table is an exciting time, and especially...
SPEAKER_01: I personally consider Cobra potentially like he's right up there as one of the pound for pound best ever to be in the sport with yourself hanging as well. So I can't wait to see this match for sure. Yeah. I mean, on the paper, Cobra looks favorite because when Cobra and Hyderpool, Cobra won comfortably at that time.
SPEAKER_00: And now Haidar hasn't been training five, six years maybe, I don't know. And then Cobra is not training either. So I informed them. So they both had three months to prepare. So let's see what's going to happen. I have no idea. Haidar just pulled in the grandmasters in WAP. He won. One match he struggled, but the rest he won easy in the final even. Some had a pause for picture and then win. But let's see what's going to happen. Anyways, so Zurab, my friend, thank you, thank you, thank you very, very much, my friend. Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: And be, be easy on Ryan, be easy on Ryan. And, you know, just, you know, he's going to commentate after this match. So, you know, be easy on him, please.
SPEAKER_03: He's joking that he will carry about the show and he will lose 3-0 after the try-on.
SPEAKER_01: just don't do what bogdan stalker did don't capitulate once you feel the hand and you know all that pressure that you've you've got just just overwhelms you i look forward to a good battle and uh and again i can't wait to put on a good show
SPEAKER_00: right right i i'm curious when people are saying that you know you are heavily underdog and when i just tell him that be easy on ryan he's gonna commentate i'm curious you know when we joke like this how do you feel you are like you know okay let me surprise you i love it i i genuinely love it like i said i love jumping in the deep end i love being the underdog i i i almost feel sorry for my opponents because of the amount of pressure that they get put on like it's it's unfair
SPEAKER_01: It's an unfair situation for me. So I'm sorry, Zurab, that you're going to have the weight of the world telling you to win easy. Like I said, there's something happens when that moment arrives, when you realize it's, oh, hang on, it's not as easy as everyone said it would be. That mental pressure gets a bit crazy. So I hope you handle it well and it's a good battle. That's all I'll say. Yeah. Let's translate this one if you understood because you have some heavy accent.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, sorry, Ron Barth can't understand me either. Can you translate this, what he said to Zura, if you understand? Yes, I will translate. Zura, in the end, I would like to thank you for all the support you have given me.
SPEAKER_03: I would like to thank you for the opportunity to talk to you about this topic. And what I would like to say is that I would like to thank you for the opportunity to talk to you about this topic. And what I would like to say is that I would like to thank you for the opportunity to talk to you about this topic. And I would like to thank you for the opportunity to talk to you about this topic.
SPEAKER_03: If I don't win, I'll lose the whole year. When I won the World Cup in February, I went to Brazil, and I went to see the Red Bulls, and I went to see the game, and I was amazed.
SPEAKER_03: When I will defeat Ryan, I will give him a friendly hug. And when he will be commentating, I will bring him sometimes Red Bull, sometimes coffee, and I will be caring about him. Such a gentleman. Such a gentleman, I love it. Best friends afterwards. And one last thing. I, Zurab, I, myself, John Burzink, Devin Larat, Denis Shiplenko,
SPEAKER_00: And Levan Saginashvili, even Levan Saginashvili and Hermes Kasparin and Dave Sheffy, we will be at Ryan's corner to coach him. What are you going to do? Zura, I'm going to tell you everything. I'm going to tell you everything. I'm going to tell you everything.
SPEAKER_03: It will be very interesting. But will it change anything? Tell me, will it change anything, the result? Well, it depends on what happens next.
SPEAKER_03: so you think about the results but he's sure the results will be like okay okay let's end it with one more flex off come on i want to bicep flex off from zero
SPEAKER_00: Look at the farm. I think I'm closer than people expect. I think I got him. Look at that wrist. Yeah, yeah. Yours is bigger, yeah, Ryan. That's bigger forearm. You have bigger bicep. Yeah. Anyways, Silky Wilkie, Ryan, it is not East versus West, but would you face BLM?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I know BLM. BLM is in the pipeline for sure. We were meant to face the WAL just before COVID killed it all. So I haven't forgotten BLM someday for sure. Okay. Okay.
