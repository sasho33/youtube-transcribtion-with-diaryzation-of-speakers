SPEAKER_03: Austin Wade. Hello, my friend. What's up? Hello, Marius. Yeah. Also, how are you? How do you feel after your match with recovery? Yeah, we had to do an interview with you, right? Podcast.
SPEAKER_03: Um, yeah, I feel good. Yeah. Yeah, chest will be okay. Like, I think I did already one training, but not I didn't push it. And the next time I think it will be a bit of Hello, die. G. Alexander, what is he basically Murat Muharrem? Oh, hello. Hello, Michael.
SPEAKER_03: Hello, Daniel. Uh-oh, Kirill Bogdansky, my old and good friend Kirill Bogdansky is here to watch his countrymen. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we need to do this, my friend. We need to do this. Just like incredibly, incredibly busy. I don't know what's that, but hello, Joseph. Hello, my friend.
SPEAKER_03: John Brown, hello from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. My first World Championships, Edmonton. Wow. Ernesto will not wrap his match. I don't know if I should do something crazy and wrap their match. Thank you, thank you, Pulcero. Thank you, my friends. Viva Puerto Rico.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Risto is very dangerous guy. People are underestimating him. They don't know about him. He is world champion. His unorthodox style is very, I'll say, dangerous. Let's see. Windagos is competent and I see that Risto is training. I don't know who is crushing who, but
SPEAKER_03: I'm not interested with their parts as an organizer. But I mean, they always have big dreams, so. I wouldn't mind seeing you in this. Yeah, I'm Jay Klien. I'm senior level WAF referee.
SPEAKER_03: I remember in 2015 I went to antalya they did the Asian championships there at that time I went there as an announcer and then they needed referee I started referee and then they made me do like I don't know which army it was, but all the senior finals, you know the guy the Asian Federation had said no, no you stay there, you know. And then come to you. yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So I'm not only trainer, I'm not only arm master, I'm not only organizer, I'm also WAF senior level referee. But usually I go to WAF as an athlete or technical director, so I'm not allowed to ref there.
SPEAKER_03: because my official duty is different. Yeah, people thought that Arsene was early, but I just showed with the slow motions that it was not the case. John could have won that match if he didn't try to hook him.
SPEAKER_03: without the strap, you know, every time he just sleep in the strap. Anyway, so we are waiting for our guests six more minutes and then they will be here. And East versus West coming very soon.
SPEAKER_03: I believe there will be some unforgettable moments. John was like, you know, just, he could just go and then go strap and, I mean, take Arsene's wrist, you know, but he was like, you know, still jumping in, you know, and then it's just so, it's possible to get Arsene Lillia back. I don't know, my friend, Arsene, Arsene as a guest here, I also invited him, he had like business or something, but I will, again, you know,
SPEAKER_03: alexander head shell sorry if i pronounce wrong yeah let's see how it will be i don't know i every time i see a mirror or camera i just like i like to look at the forearm here oh somebody came let's see who is that
SPEAKER_03: Is 70 kilo back pressure good at 78 kg body weight engine at 18? Yeah, it's good, but I need to see the form, how you do. You know, the single cable or like... Hello, hello, hello, hello. How are you, Christo? Can you turn? You need to, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You let them dictate matches. Much. Do you do her me. yeah yeah I need to answer. So much noise. So.
SPEAKER_03: i'm outside my friend um this is disrespectful do you realize that devon lost his last match and i took tons of that you know referee was against him just i mean if he wins people like you just bullshitting like this if he loses the opposite way is just going attacking like i mean what's wrong with you guys you know so just
SPEAKER_03: i don't think i need someone like you and then people just get angry with me but you know the life is better without you guys trust me ah mr ref no uh no my friend it is if i do only youtube then then you can do that but if it is through the zoom they allow us to do
SPEAKER_03: um one second i've been johnny nation youtube the denouement yeah i mean he just tries to disrespect you know you can see that that's that's not a like a question they just come here just try to create perception you know just like they i mean this is the reason they are coming you know anyway so christo i see you are training all those training videos i see
SPEAKER_03: and like how do you see this it is so do you see like it is because i i said um yannis he got hurt and then i said dog ehrlich he got hurt and then i i said arthur macaro and arthur macaro i forgot that i promised petrenko and the ukrainian federation that ukrainians who live in ukraine let's call on the phone and i just are you in here
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah um so the question is like how do you uh how do you feel this about this match like i said yanis
SPEAKER_03: He got hurt the elbow, and then I said, Doc, early he got hurt, and then I said, Arthur Makaro, by forgetting that I promised the Ukrainian Armistice Federation that the athletes from Ukraine who lives in Ukraine can get permission only
SPEAKER_03: to pull events where the russians are not part of it so why what i did so i put augusta went the russians and then i put petrenko to the joy event and some people says like prudnik and russland is also ukraine but they don't live in ukraine they don't need permission to get out of ukraine
SPEAKER_03: so it's different things you know i need to explain so then after match i have i also at the council so now you are pulling mindagos do you see this match is something like a beginning or like you know or east versus west that is so as an athlete or like how do you see this magic are you gonna kick this guy's ass
SPEAKER_02: I think I will kick his ass. The only thing I worry about is my IQ to be enough to lose my weight for the tournament. Like a power, I feel very strong now. I don't know. I know he's very good. I see how he beat Cherkasov, but maybe Cherkasov wasn't in good shape exactly in this moment.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know, but I saw them I saw them pulling at the Moldova event there he also be check us or even easier, maybe you remember 2018 yeah I think mean that was a style is so dangerous for me not for check us out and.
SPEAKER_03: and then yeah um timmy turner i have no idea my friend i have no idea when you are when you hate someone the your hate makes you blind that's why probably they just like still see something there you know i have no idea my friend i feel sorry for those people and so as like as as einstein says that you know it is harder to crack the prejudice than at home so this is what it is you know
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. And so world's strangest man. I saw your last video. It was very nice, my friend. Very nice. Yeah. And so but you know, you will weigh in Friday morning and your competition is Saturday evening. So I think you will you will you will recover. But like, are you in a shape as good as your European shape?
SPEAKER_03: uh maybe a little bit better maybe a little bit better oh that's good yeah and it is one minute after seven and this mindagua sky is not here so it just means that um no there is no problem maybe he's scared he's scared yeah that's what it is i i know that i know that he he hates to pull against you i know that and so also
SPEAKER_03: maybe he thinks that he's just like a superstar and he needs to come last, you know, like, see, he came, you know, now we're going to ask him, okay, Minagos, you came a minute late. Is that because you are scared of me, Hristo, or you feel like you're a superstar that you need to, I'm just joking, you know. Yeah, I was just trying to quickly set up this background. Oh, nice.
SPEAKER_03: yeah tristo was telling us how he's going to kick your ass is this what he said okay let me hear it from him directly so i can be sure okay i will ask the same question tristo are you gonna kick this guy's ass i i will i will i will kick his ass
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, what is the record between you two? I saw Mindagos beating you, I think 2018 or 17 Europeans, 18?
SPEAKER_03: maybe and it was a long match you took him to the very bad position and then he just held you there like maybe like one inch on the pad and then he put his shoulder with the dead wrist you know and but i think there was like a some protest and rematch or something i don't remember exactly but did you guys also pull this last one uh yeah we pull we did and then there you go right
SPEAKER_02: I won easy you know it's with just fast start you know but he was tired he he made very long match with Armenian that's the truth you know but I think even if I had this much I will beat him yeah there's no doubt about it you know like I mean that was is nowhere at your level mister I have to be a little bit careful now because I lost too many opponents and I think
SPEAKER_01: part of like partly the reason was because i was too confident and maybe i was talking in a way which was a bit scary so the crystal i have to be very careful i i will try to be humble and life is humbling you huh it's good different i would never think that anything on this line would humble you but oh wow wow so crystal let me ask you one question
SPEAKER_01: uh you probably know but uh i have mastered arm wrestling completely right what have you heard about it what's that no no about me mastering everything completely
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy is just mastering arm wrestling. I'm going to make it his trading card with all 10s. 10, 10, 10, 10, 10. Inside 10, outside 10, shoulder pressure 10, side pressure 10, IQ, wrist experience, endurance, explosiveness, everything. Hand control 10. Yeah. So, Kristo, you would obviously agree with this statement, right? Oh, yeah, I'm agree. I'm agree.
SPEAKER_01: so we have no issues here that's fine now another question since you know you are a very good referee everyone is respecting you for that refereeing also requires a lot of skill and understanding right like you you cannot take good decisions if you don't understand the sport law so would you be able to say that you have also mastered armwrestling like me
SPEAKER_02: or do you think like maybe you still need to improve a little bit maybe some still some areas where you could train more and maybe get better what do you think i think i i must train more to improve some of i understand everything you know like i know exactly what's happening why that's happening but i didn't training the small things what i must be training like
SPEAKER_02: You and Engin, you have very good wrist control. You pull before the start a little bit in every inch of the match. You know, you take the small advantage, very small advantage on the referee's grip all the time. You and Engin also. No, wait a second. It's actually only Engin, not me. No, this is me. I can throw it. And Hristo, you too. You too.
SPEAKER_02: it's it's millimeter you know it's millimeter it's millimeter and when i fight with you and in and also with the mindogas it's not necessary to to go there to uh how i see to to go in this game to fix this millimeters no i leave leave you to do your game and i just start with the force you know only first i'm too strong now
SPEAKER_01: But okay, so I'm glad to hear that you can still see some areas where you can improve. Because, you know, I was, instead of training, I was preparing some lessons for you. And I feel like I will be able to teach a couple of things during the match. I mean, you took his last question very seriously. He was actually making fun with you that he mastered the armresting.
SPEAKER_03: Like, how do you see yourself? Like, he is just like, you know, like you said, it's too serious to answer the question. He's just saying that you can only be a student for him. You know, this is exactly what he was. You know, I can learn something when I win, you know. Also, you can learn when you're winning.
SPEAKER_03: yeah but but i mean that was cannot he already mastered everything yeah every step is already kept so no nowhere to improve yeah there is the do you guys wanna see my trading cards that i asked to i asked to uh four people yannis but my prime my prime not today when i was in good shape you know when young
SPEAKER_03: um i asked to devon neil pick up yannis and travis versions uh but don't be so i mean you wouldn't be jealous i mean i guess because you are already 10 10 10 10. so inside in the prime 8.5 outside 10 side pressure 9.5
SPEAKER_03: Shoulder pressure 8.5, table IQ 10, wrist 10, experience 10, hand control 10, endurance 8.5, explosiveness 10. It's bullshit. It's too good. No, this is not true. Maybe inside it's 5. No, you don't know my prime. I even won world titles in the final matches in hook.
SPEAKER_03: You are just talking about the injured engine, not the prime engine. By the way, did you guys ever fight each other? Yeah, yeah. Left arm I won, right arm he won, yeah. So you won against Tengen? Yeah, yeah. I mean, from 2007 to 2018, 11 years with right arm, I never won even a medal.
SPEAKER_03: because he was terribly injured right arm, but left arm still was winning second, third, winning, you know. But then I took a break like one and a half years after 2016 Europeans. And then after the one and a half year break, then like I should have done this long time ago instead of pushing everywhere when Europeans, world's nations, European world's nations, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: you see christo and me we actually have some similarities when because uh when i met engen at zloty i also completely destroyed the destroyed him so we have we both destroyed me i beat you 12 times 12 times and then it was super easy i will tell you how the first match i pin you referee didn't give it okay and then there was a foul you won i went to the b side
SPEAKER_03: and then in the final again i took you like that close and then okay you i was just playing your wrist was just you were like a waiter like this like this so you see how much i gave you and still do you know do you know do you know it was only four weeks ago i competed 143 65 kilo
SPEAKER_03: So I lost so much weight. And then three months later, we did a super match. I beat you 10-0. 5-0, right? Good that you reminded. And 5-0. And a year before the Zloty, again, I just throw you in like a second. And then also I beat you in Europeans. Oh, you don't remember that. I can make the video just watch already. I only remember Zloty. Oh, yeah. So I beat you 12 times and you beat me twice with fouls. So just don't go there.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, just focus on your match. Let's focus on mine. Yeah. I think, how is our score, Minda? 1-1 on the right? So, to be honest, I really don't remember. I just remember, yes, you did get that win recently, last year, WAF Worlds. We did that in Moldavia. We didn't compete on the right, yeah? We met on the left only. Yeah, my memory is really bad.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I lose from Emile Sherdaryan in Moldova in the right, or I didn't remember who also beat me, but I think it was you. That's me in 1-1. Maybe I do remember beating you a couple of times, like more than twice. The left arm, left arm. My left, it's, you know, just hold the table. I have only third place in the world before, I don't know, 2006 or 2007 was in Manchester.
SPEAKER_03: so we have to admit that in 2015 third place in kazakhstan when when when when i zaira everyone was in one group and you were in the other group so you you get undefeated while we all kill each other but then you lost to me and then you lost to uh zair ahmedov yeah
SPEAKER_01: So I have to admit that, yes, Christo is really showing some good results. I would even say that recently he's better than I would expect him to be. Because this last Europeans, first place on the right hand, right? Yeah, yeah, in 85 kilos. And you almost kind of stopped even the champion, 85 kilos. Yeah, so which is a very heavy class. I didn't meet him. I met the second, Nedelin.
SPEAKER_02: i think i can beat the first first first one i can beat him but the second uh i lose with two fouls no but even the netherlands are very close you had a good stop yeah yeah he lost yeah i beat him on the national i beat him on the national oh let's let's see let's see you find that video no no no i just want to remind somebody sex just helped his
SPEAKER_01: memory yeah that's not yeah no that's a fake video fake video okay by ai no no no no it didn't happen
SPEAKER_03: Anyway, so I was asking Hristo, like, is it gonna be a match that he was replaced or he come and pull or he wants to make a new beginning as a pro start? Like at the East versus West stage, like Hristo, is this the last time are we gonna see you at the East versus West stage as a competitor or more?
SPEAKER_03: I think it must be more, you know, if I beat Minda... Yeah, but you don't. What do you mean? One second, one second. Every time I say, Jerry, Jerry, if you win against Hermes and this is the belt, and he says, what do you mean if? He tells me that I should say when, not if. And then are you going to beat this guy or not? You will, right? I will beat him.
SPEAKER_01: but if he start to crying, you know, I must give him so much, you know, it's because I know it's very important to him to, to win. You mean, you mean one round or one round? Oh, one round. Yeah. You can, you can just more than that. Okay. So how can you really get that pin on me? I really don't see any, any options for you. Just a, quite a short arm, short hand, small hand. Um,
SPEAKER_01: know that you will not get not get into the hook you will do a desperation move at the end how did he not get in the hook he hook you even when you beat him one time he didn't remember the last time when no no the last time when we competing i just hooked him very fast you know yes and exactly he was tired he was tired as you said but but even when he beat you
SPEAKER_03: you did that your style you took him down he stopped you like one centimeter from the pad and then you held him there held him there and he was just holding and then he did very smart thing he just let his wrist go and then put the shoulder and then beat you i don't know if you remember or not i remember of course i remember but that you know the referee first the referee give me the pin but because the first referee give me the pin not the second and the second referee
SPEAKER_03: wait too long you know oh you think it was happy you think it was happy you think it was happy i think few of the the few of the times was a pin yeah oh so so as a referee you also get unfair calls you know what i will do i'm gonna call devon larat and he is gonna ref your match oh that's where we got it
SPEAKER_01: why do we even talk about the past it it's really not so relevant anymore this is a different time different me different crystal so i feel like it's gonna be super easy oh and listen are you gonna listen since you have an opponent now you had uh either hand
SPEAKER_03: and now you had after that you had uh chat castle even with chat castle match you were a little bit you know like I don't want to mention how you were but you know you just look at the crowd and you know I think that you will do the similar things with Christo as well well Christo you know
SPEAKER_01: we don't need to make fun of christo too much right we still respect respect him a lot as a referee and so on maybe not not so much as an athlete but i know that christo likes refereeing a lot i feel like this the faster i do this three zero three zero and he can go back to refereeing i feel like the more happy christo will be so he wouldn't make he wouldn't make
SPEAKER_03: mistakes for the next of the evening i mean by not losing so much energy yeah exactly so he needs to concentrate on refereeing we just finish it quickly and you know move on did you hear what he said he said he respect you as a referee so much not as an athlete did you hear that part yeah but but you know probably he didn't know me like athletes he he competing uh not so much time you know it's uh when when
SPEAKER_02: Minda, when did you start competing in car wrestling? In 2010. 2010. And when is your first World Championship? Yeah, I don't remember. Bad memory. I remember for sure Lithuania 2014 because I flashed him. Right.
SPEAKER_03: 2012 i take the world title in brazil yeah brazil yeah just to inform you and can you ask him how many world titles uh mindago says how many minutes but look brazil is very far away i i was not going to brazil engen was again were you going to brazil yeah yeah yeah yeah i was in different class
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah different classes it was just i made a huge huge mistake i had do you guys remember my photo with left arm is like 30 centimeters have you seen that photo that like i had the neck hernia yeah i don't remember you remember that right yeah i i shouldn't doctor said i could become even a paralyzed but i still travel there you know yeah and so i don't know tristo is still dangerous he just took third place at 85 kilo do you think you can beat thomas
SPEAKER_01: uh good question yeah thomas is good but so yeah maybe just one more thing uh the crystal which we saw maybe like three years ago or earlier i would not be worried about that crystal i am still a little bit worried about this new crystal who is going to 85 kilo classes and winning third places so but actually i'm i was 82 kilo not 85 i was 82 and i'm fat i'm still fat um
SPEAKER_03: so i can see something i can see some good change but 77 will be perfect you know i will feeling category category is 75 just to remind you there's yeah anyway so anything else i don't know i asked you a question but you kind of ignore you know about okay yeah sorry say it again about thomas if you could beat him or not you know
SPEAKER_03: I think it's difficult, I think it's difficult. Because you're attacking to his hand while he's attacking his arm right here. Yeah, his hand control is very good, very good. Yeah. His hand control is very good, but again, you know, it's more possible to beat him inside than beat him outside. So I think that is why Hristo has better chance. But how do you see that? Do you think that Hristo cannot hook you?
SPEAKER_01: he could hook me let's say if i didn't lose against him just recently like last year then maybe he can trick me again but now i lost and i learned my lesson i mastered arm wrestling completely now and it is impossible at this point i will be very super ready to catch that hit so we are not going into a hook no okay you what tristo i i training a lot my wrist and i improve my wrist and
SPEAKER_02: Now, even when I competing in a European championship, uh, going in hook because he knows if he tried to pull me like example in the nationals in Bulgarian, he tried to pull me in the first round and I smashed him, you know, because my wrist now it's very good without strapping. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. You will beat him, right? Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. I will just be waiting for Kristo to finally start giving up and go into a desperation move so I can showcase my new techniques and new skills because I'm pretty good at pressing without my wrist now. So I'm ready for it. That must be when my biceps is tired. If it's not tired, don't do this because we'll be, you know, must hold a long time to go this way. I know exactly what I'm doing.
SPEAKER_03: Don't worry. If you start in the beginning, it's dangerous. Yeah, I mean, right. But, you know, it's a direct foul, right? If you're Goumeros, you know that it is so, you know that, right? Yeah, I know. But I will be in the winning position if I stay in this position. I mean, your shoulder position is not important. Your hand needs to be here, right? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: okay okay yeah yeah so i mean as as long as as long as you stay in the losing position with your hand there is no problem who knows maybe i will put the stripes on and then maybe i will be wrapping you guys yeah i i hope i mean it's enough strong can make a good long match not fast wing
SPEAKER_02: wow do you do you do you uh how much do you believe in what you said that like it may be a quick match you think that it may be a quick match um first or second first and second maybe and when i going tired because he he say he's very have big endurance um after that will be a long
SPEAKER_01: Hristo, did you ever beat Cherkasov? Never. Okay. Did you fight him a lot? One or two times, maybe one time. Yeah, but again, you know, Styles, you couldn't beat Toms probably. He did. He couldn't beat Cherkasov, you beat. Let's not say that. I could probably beat Toms. Oh, okay. No, no chance.
SPEAKER_02: No chance. No chance. Tom's will be very, very strong for you. After this match, you'll probably change your mind. After our match, you'll probably change your mind. Tom's lose only from me and from Nedelin only in hook. But on the left arm, he was amazing. So yeah, left arm.
SPEAKER_01: i would maybe admit that yeah thomas is probably better than me left arm left arm he is amazing right arm let's see but just he's right he's stronger i don't think he's right it's stronger it could be but maybe he's also a little bit injured or something is wrong um maybe something was wrong during that european tournament so yeah
SPEAKER_03: yeah this this is what i was talking about yeah crazy stuff you see that left arm only only only only bone left you know nothing no chest no shoulders still probably bigger than mine at the moment come on it's like yeah
SPEAKER_03: anyway so it's good it is good that you guys believe in yourselves and it is always good to good to um have a podcast with guys like you too because if i ask you the matches and predictions you for sure would have an opinion about most of these matches so let's start first
SPEAKER_03: This one, as always, I just want, uh, a quick, um, just percentage. No, no, I don't want any kind of prediction, like in a detailed way or something. Just say 70, 30, 80, 20 or something. Okay. I start with Christo. The first, Christo Delizacco, Mindaugas Thalassitis. 90 to 10. Who is 90?
SPEAKER_01: Me? Or Hristo? Hristo is lying. There's no way he has so much confidence. Hristo is lying. Are you lying, Hristo? No, I just will give him 10, you know, because it's... I told you. Do not crying. Okay, okay, okay. Good. And you, Milagros?
SPEAKER_01: 100% to 0%. I'm winning. You're winning 100%. Wow, that's interesting. I, I don't remember when last time, both sides were just that confidence, you know, and how about you? Are you really 100% confidence? Yeah. I'm like, I'm always I'm never lying, always saying serious thing I would never really
SPEAKER_03: i would not do it just for a trash talk right okay would you would you directly go to strap with him or you're gonna try your chance without strap i like this okay okay and you dristo no without set oh without step oh that's what i thought wow that's interesting that's interesting here
SPEAKER_03: I remember you lost a match while you didn't know what to do against Giannis in 2021. You tried to go strap, something happened, and then this time you wanted to deceive him. I don't understand. You lost with the fouls, elbow fouls, right? Yeah. Yes. Wow. I thought that you would directly go to strap. That's interesting. That's interesting.
SPEAKER_03: yeah and then let's go to the next one thomas versus justin bishop in douglas you start first well if thomas was in his best shape
SPEAKER_01: which I am starting to doubt a little bit. Okay, yeah, maybe it should be a quick one, right? Maybe I will quickly just say that I don't think... No, no, this one doesn't have to be quick. This was only for your match, but it didn't go so quick. Okay, so we can get a little bit into these matches, okay. So if Toms would be in his best shape, I would be very confident in Toms, because also styles matters a lot, and then Toms can really handle all the top rollers well.
SPEAKER_01: so all the top holders right except me because i'm a hook puller also and the traps so and then uh that justin is also bringing a good shape so um i would i'm actually rooting for justin because uh i beat him like it was nothing so i would hope that he is now doing well
SPEAKER_03: oh okay so then you will prove like yes exactly i beat this guy and that guy so if justin beats thompson i can also say i beat thompson you are a terrible representative of baltic you know you should be supporting the the neighbor and harry so what do you think about justin bishop and um thompson just in 20 bish uh thompson okay okay okay one second let's stop here
SPEAKER_03: do you think that okay one second i will make a poll since you are a referee there rest of the event uh okay i don't know should there is no i think i think you shouldn't because people are already people are already looking for a reason you know not everyone that there are like yeah
SPEAKER_03: people are just fans who are messing with positive intention but there are some people are just waiting like this you know oh did you hear that did you hear that and then if something happens then they will be just attacking and then they will bring probably i'm agree with you yeah yeah but look look guys ask us only ask only mindogas you know only he can answer
SPEAKER_01: But look, I think... Isn't Kristo... Kristo, do you feel like you are not professional enough to be non-biased? I feel like... He is, he is, but the people... Some people, I should say, they are just... Engin, don't you trust Kristo in... No, I trust him. I think you don't understand what I'm saying.
SPEAKER_03: i i just say that even if he doesn't make mistake or he makes mistake if he makes a mistake i understand people criticize that's more than welcome but even if he doesn't but if his favorite guys or even if he makes a mistake people just think it's intentional you know
SPEAKER_03: anyway so it's better to not go like that okay yeah yeah but you can you can still time to time just tell this guy something you know just just but kristo could simply say what is his opinion he doesn't need to say that i i like toms or i like justin yeah but even if he says opinion you know people some people will take it wrong i catch with justin i catch with justin uh
SPEAKER_01: think when he competing with wind august i make after pulling with him and i feel i i can beat him yeah the situation between you and justin is interesting because justin is saying that i can easily beat christo i didn't feel him at all yeah yeah i heard that and christo is saying that i can be justin okay you heard what justin said that he doesn't feel irish so yeah justin said that uh no problem where did he say that
SPEAKER_02: he kept repeating to me a couple of times whenever we were talking a little bit so oh okay but is this on the social media or something or is it like maybe personal probably oh okay okay okay and then he listed you are saying that you beat him at side table yeah i i feel on the side okay we was in the middle you know i just you know when you when you do something and you don't want to show
SPEAKER_02: your best best moves just feeling where you can beat him where not you know and i i feel i can beat him so interesting okay so so what i understand from here after you beat mindagas you want to pull justin if he also wins or can be also uh
SPEAKER_03: yeah my friend i feel you're going to laugh listen that that is that is very how to say difficult how very i don't know how to say in english it is just more complicated now daniel is going there mindavas is going there kazakhstan you go in kazakhstan aydar khan is going in there you all are in same event so
SPEAKER_03: To pull against Aydar Khan is a lot up to the result of the WAF. Alan Zolaev cannot get out of Russia as of now because he goes to Army Academy. So he's out of option. And Makarov didn't go. Makarov is the second. Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: But I will not compete in the right hand on the WAF because I will go back to Sofia because I'm on the waiting on Kristian Tsanof. You're waiting on what? You know the referee, Kristian Tsanof? Yeah. And I'm on his waiting. Oh, you're going to his wedding? Yeah, yeah. Why did he put the wedding on the WAF day? Maybe a week after. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: but it's because anyways it's not my business but um because he also pulls right son of also pulls he was at the europeans right yeah but now he is 75 kilo big forearms no no no this is malakoff yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know it's an office the um he was uh in uh lithuania he took the i think
SPEAKER_02: third or second place in 100 kilo uh he he is uh son of uh stefan tanoff if you know stefan tanoff who competing with august missile on the final in heavyweight when uh the pushcart take the third place okay okay 2010 or five no ten maybe okay um
SPEAKER_03: And also as far as yeah, somebody just also wrote and I remember I doubt him is gonna pull 80 kilo at 12. Yeah. So, like, if Mindaugas wins 75 kilo, I don't think he's gonna get right away a match. But first of all, he needs to beat you. Yeah, first he must beat me. Yeah. And he wanted to say something.
SPEAKER_01: so what i understood from christo just now is that he thinks that he can he is stronger than justin but still he doesn't want to face justin so i feel like he really doesn't like justin so most likely he will be biased and he will help thomas no no i i like i like justin look at i i like i i really want to compete with justin uh just because um um beat me on the
SPEAKER_02: words and I feel I can beat him you know but he he beat me with start and I feel I catch him and I want to to try to compete with him I see I see but maybe I I will go I don't know if if Nordaleck going in um um as they get strong you know they get strong it's after one week even not one week more how many days it's uh competing there
SPEAKER_02: probably i they all the time they compete they going in competing and and i will be there and it's i'm not sure now it's good to competing on my right hand or not you know i understand anyway so this mindagos is saying that
SPEAKER_03: if you ref justin match you will not be fair to mean daggers even in a joking way there are a lot of a lot of hate and perception about these kind of things please you know don't don't put more right yeah but uh okay but i'm not gonna put you the justin match after what mindy just said just remind me you know you're not gonna have that much but um by the way um
SPEAKER_03: I don't know how to pronounce his last name or he is coming both July and August events and as the referee from us and we will add another referee from us for the future events. We were going to start already with the August, but the person is not available. I will announce his name later.
SPEAKER_03: What was I going to say? Okay, the thing is, Alonzo Lev cannot leave Russia. And the second best look like it's Makaro. You know, he will stop him first match really long again, minimum 30, 40 seconds. They never had an easy match.
SPEAKER_03: so i think that if the waff if daniel wins and then he may he may get the uh the match title match with against uh macaro oh no either macaro doesn't have the title and but if mindagos wins i think macaro is gonna pull either hand because mindagos already
SPEAKER_03: little bit delayed his so okay so if i win or it doesn't matter if i win or if i don't win right now i still don't get it if daniel wins the rough and if i said daniel against either hand and then maybe you will pull makaro then i mean trust me you can trust me i'm gonna do uh a lot of things you know as much as i can you know me and i really want to see daniel with makarov
SPEAKER_03: I didn't remember, did they meet somewhere or not? They did. In 2018, I think Europeans, Makaro was first and second was Daniel.
SPEAKER_03: Daniel was in the same category as a weight with Makaro, but in 2017 Hungary and 2018 Antalya. I think Daniel didn't pull with right arm. He just pulled with left arm. He won, but he didn't pull with right arm. What do you guys think about their match? Daniel and Makaro? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: uh you mean the match if which could happen right now at this time you just say like 75 kilo if they pulled yeah i feel like it's interesting it might maybe now it's a bit closer than before so maybe daniel has a bigger chance now still you think that daniel has more chance than arthur no i mean more higher than before okay specifically what is that more than before me
SPEAKER_01: Maybe it's getting to 40-70. Let's say 40-70. 40 and 70, I would say. 30-70. Yeah, because technically it's still a difficult match for him. Very strong hook puller, Makaro. I feel like he can deal well with Prokopchuk. Yeah, 30-70 for Artur, you are saying. And what do you think about that? Both are 75 kilos each. 50-50. I really didn't know who would win.
SPEAKER_03: yeah okay i understand and i asked to i asked to Mazgan Shamir about a possible left arm match between Daniel and Alain Zoller because if you guys realize that Mazgan had final with Alain in 2021 75 and then following year he had the final with Daniel at 75.
SPEAKER_03: And I mean, who could say a better opinion because he might be inside with both of them. And he said 60% Alan, 40% Daniel, he said left arm. Wow. Yeah, this is what I thought he would say 50-50, but probably he felt something stronger with Alan. But you can never underestimate Daniel. Yeah. Wow. On the left arm. Yeah. Interesting.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's interesting. We need to do the left arm world title as well for 75 kilo. Well, it's happening now, right? Yeah, this is what's happening. And then what do you think? I'm not asking you this stuff. What do you think about Emil and Daniel left arm? I remember last time they pulled in the same category, Emil won 2019 world. And then
SPEAKER_03: 2019 or 18 bulgaria europeans when you did the final with emil and i think tork was chakazo and daniel wasn't in top three in the category that emil won how do you see that
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so many things have changed since when. I feel like Daniel is maybe a bit more solid now. So I would maybe even guess that Daniel would actually take that win. But we know that Emil is also very special on the left. So it's just a good match. But you are saying that Emil also has a chance to win? For sure, for sure, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, okay. So you are saying the both have chat. Because a lot of people on social media, they don't know Emil. They just say that like 100% Daniel is going to destroy. Who knows? But Emil is not someone to underestimate. Do you think Emil's left arm is same level or right? It's better than right, for sure. Better than right. Okay, I understand. He told me personally his right is better, but I don't know. Anyway, so who knows? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: anyway so another match uh reno message versus opperman ah so only me right like yeah um opperman is not bad as as i know because he recently pulled at armors um but reno is also amazing so it's just maybe this is one of the matches which we just have to see
SPEAKER_01: i still don't feel like i have enough information on on both of these guys both of them are quite new so when you say quite new you're talking about terence after he made a comeback yeah for example yeah exactly and reno is just quite still quite young still growing i don't know exactly where he is yet so but if i had to guess maybe i would even guess reno wins i understand
SPEAKER_03: yeah he put his yeah he had a very good match against lamparelli it was very good you know and and then another one we can talk about chance show versus petrenko but just i'm just warning you chances in the chat room right now so okay cool no chance they are pulling on the right yeah i feel like i need to mention that chance is very weak on his left even i'm much stronger than chance yes
SPEAKER_01: okay something off topic but it's still nice to mention on the right hand chance is not bad i feel like technically he could be in a good spot here like because um we saw petrenko losing to brzenk losing his wrist against brzing so i feel like chance can probably do the same and then uh and then maybe he can just finish the match little by little okay so you are giving the edge to chance
SPEAKER_03: yes yes but does it have anything to do that because he's in the chat room right now no it doesn't no no okay i'm just teasing you yeah anyway so let's go latin versus mike aiello
SPEAKER_03: uh interesting i've so we did meet before maybe quite recently last or no four years ago okay met and mike won comfortably as far as i remember and but both are i mean improved even more because he was a newer puller yeah
SPEAKER_01: so should be a cool match quite even i would say local probably caught up a little bit he did great um just recently against um who is who was that guy the guy who went to australia and pulled him just recently now did you see the message that chance wrote mean that i will get my left rematch with you soon wow chance i wish you never said that you know you just admitted that this guy beat you he just said that you are not so strong but
SPEAKER_01: he didn't have to admit that front of everyone that you know i'm joking they have to make a super match world title world title world title world title superman about what about uh trash talk oh yeah that would work yeah
SPEAKER_01: anyways so that's what we said jordan celia so lachlan just defeated jordan cell which yeah so looked very very confident to me very solid so i was i would assume that lachlan is ready i'm not sure if mike is in his best shape at the moment but um 50 50 good match 50 50. okay mike competing a long time ago
SPEAKER_03: don't know i didn't see some i think he said like one and a half year or something he had like a four-way super match with jordan seal chance show himself and one more guy i forgot uh who was that the other guy uh don underwood i think don underwood and what do you think about elizabeth versus carolina um i like carolina more
SPEAKER_01: i'm not asking uh hi if about if you if you're talking about arm wrestling um i don't know elizabeth i haven't seen her pull so it's difficult to say okay this one we need to pass then then okay let's go to the paulo versus sandras
SPEAKER_01: People like Pavlo, but I don't like him so much. I don't think he's a good armwrestler yet. Just a big guy. Can you clarify when you say you don't like him? As an armwrestler or as a person? Yeah, as an armwrestler. Not enough skill yet. I don't like how he is just being very big, but not so skilled. So I think chance will handle him. Maybe he'll make him tired over a couple of rounds and then get it done.
SPEAKER_03: okay okay so i'm saying sandra 70 and there's finally you felt your baltic blood you know in your face yeah okay yeah and then let's go okay we passed this one already and daniel procopchuk emil we talk also and you said what how much would you say 50 50 or you said a little bit today let's say still 60 40 to daniel but emil has a very good chance
SPEAKER_01: okay i'm waiting to see if he brought a good shape okay and wagner bought a lot of ferrets also wagner is coming i didn't even notice cool i'm gonna kick him out from the car you know he doesn't even know cool very cool so uh must be ferret ferret
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, my opinion is that when Wagner is put in his shoulder, it really requires very strong bicep. I think that for Ferit to win, Ferit needs to take him to the
SPEAKER_03: know this side so that wagner's hand can be here once wagner puts the shoulder many people feels like a building is collapsing on their arm you know just like and so i i think it's all about the starts all about we know what exactly wagner is gonna do it's all about how ferret prepared himself for this match you know he has chance to win if he does the right move he is going
SPEAKER_03: chance to win if he if he just tries to hold him there on his bicep not sure about that the guy is just really um yeah so ferret needs to follow a good strategy okay let's go i'm very very interesting about your opinion not your opinion mr not yours
SPEAKER_01: These are the matches that you will be reffing. So Artem looks very good lately, right? He's gaining a lot of mass and strength quickly. It seems so. But Gennady is also not bad at all. So it's difficult. It's really difficult.
SPEAKER_01: maybe let me try to predict the future maybe i will say gennady i know it doesn't sound that i really don't have any good arguments but i still feel like gennady can can hook marozo well and beat him
SPEAKER_03: um but i know that you know it's difficult when these guys are jumping up and down so much they are not very stable one day they are like crazy strong and nowadays they take a break the one thing about gennady is that i think this guy is mentally and spiritually very strong guy it seems to me very very hard to intimidate the guy if devon
SPEAKER_03: Like Devon win or lose, it doesn't matter. But Devon could not intimidate getting the guy's head, you know. The guy was not like, he didn't give a shit about the mental game I'm talking about. So I think that once the match, if he stops someone in like an equal position, this is where you really need to dominate the guy, you know. Like how Devon got the first round position. Otherwise, the guy is just different, you know. The guy...
SPEAKER_02: like mentally the guy is i don't know to me very strong big hearts you remember you remember in moscow when was um european championship yeah and have a mass wrestling championship oh yeah this one you're talking about yes and uh also the plank of competing in this and ghana competing
SPEAKER_02: and won World Champion of Mass Wrestling from Russia. Gennady beat Teplenkov and after that Gennady beat the World Champion of Mass Wrestling and take a win. He said, I never do this before. He also competed in the European Armwrestling Championships before that.
SPEAKER_02: yeah but because he on the left arm he was i think uh he was in uh one of them he was in uh the finals on the first three uh he was medalist but another arm he competing with um thompson's for fifth and sixth place yeah yeah okay yeah so he competed the arm wrestling and then he beat those guys
SPEAKER_03: yes yes yes wow i'm telling you the guy is not normal some some people are not normal you know that's because mentally he just he never give up you know he hold it he say don't give up and that's all yeah and also we have to remember that gennady is in a very good spot as well now like i remember him a couple of years ago
SPEAKER_03: um somewhere in moldova also and then a couple years later he was he was struggling a little bit yeah he was just a bit terrible something was wrong he was he was injured and he got even more injured there as far as i remember and he couldn't pull after 2018 moldova until endo 2021 where he pulled hermes it was his first match yeah and he was terribly hurt
SPEAKER_02: and but now he's now lately every single match he's better and better and better yeah it's very beautiful now like i really like to watch him yeah he says that he says yeah in moldavia he competing with uh dimitri vizin i think and they're going to the strap match and when they slip out he fell down on the floor
SPEAKER_02: and he cannot stand up because he was very very fat you know and i give him a hand to pull him to the to the table and he watched me on the ice and i watched him and it was very very funny you know because he was fat there you know he wasn't strong he was just fat he couldn't get up yeah he could it was very very funny yeah yeah and and and uh chris is making fun of ganadi like he is biased again
SPEAKER_03: look at the the minagas we really need to do something with this guy when he comes here we need to take him somewhere quiet and then just take care of him and and and morozov is also the guy is just the the way he performed against uh corey west i mean he was incredible and
SPEAKER_03: I'm guessing his right arm is even better because left arm still has the issues. He told me this. And I don't know, Morozov is there also to prove himself. And let's see what we can do. I mean, like,
SPEAKER_03: I will be watching like probably my elbow will hurt everywhere because like I love arm wrestling whenever I watch I live it you understand and then imagine the Morozov and Gennady Radigo boom you know probably my elbows will hurt so terribly you know like I'm like I would I like have you guys so you were in you were not right you were no it was before your time it was 2003 Europeans
SPEAKER_03: and in 78 kilo and rushtan babayev had a hook match in the final like it was just like incredible the the pressure there where was this where was this hanoi germany hanoi oh no it wasn't but i was before that i 2002 i was in uh czech republic in brazil okay my first my first european
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, first time I remember you were in 2005, three years after your first time. We were in the same category in Sofia, where I won right and left. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a tough category. There was Zolev, there was Lubomir, there was Rez Serdekian, Yijaba Getirashvili. The Georgian guy who competing in disabled class now, how was the name? No, that's not the guy.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, is he competing there? Yeah, yeah. He's competing in Cebu. Yeah. Matias Vili or something. What was it? I forget his name. Yeah. And there was Kazimir Iskandaro. You. It was tough club. Yeah. It was the first doping tested event. First doping tested event. Yeah. I remember. Yeah. When I competed there, they said, oh, Zola is there. He's going to do like this and that and that. You know? I remember. Yeah. So let's go.
SPEAKER_01: last match jerry cadoret versus hermes gasparini in davos it's difficult to predict but i go for jerry oh you go for jerry i really you know i have this theory where it's like a rock paper scissors
SPEAKER_03: jerry has a good technique against uh hermes i hope my theory works because i you know so i want to see jerry win if jerry doesn't yeah why is that you are a top roller usually usually you know when whenever i see a top roller and hook puller pulling like i'm like you know i go like with the top because i i'm
SPEAKER_03: I feel myself more close to the top roller guy, you know, what to do about, you know, like against the hook puller. But what is your reason? Is it because you are close with me, Jerry? No, you see, for you, since you only know how to top roll, of course you are close to top roll, but I'm close to every technique.
SPEAKER_01: So I just want the balance between the techniques to be in place, right? I like to see even these techniques. Yeah, you are like that. Just next time, please prove this, what you are saying by going inside with Daniel and Makaro. And then I will say, yes, you are close to every technique. Like, come on. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: 10, 10, 10. You can go in hook in the middle, in the beginning of our match if you want. Yeah, forget about Makaro, forget about Daniel. Just go with Hristo right away. Sure, you know, we will try some top roll maybe at the beginning. We will go in the hook later, sure. And then the press to finish. No, you can, when we are fresh, you can go in hook just to improve your stronger. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: All right. Right. Okay. Okay. We, we approve that you just bullshit, you know? No, we will think about it. No, no, no, no. But you are not like, I mean, I have won WAF world titles in hook. I have won like this in the final. I don't pull myself. Like, you know, I am, I'm like good in the, all this, this, this, even I won world titles in that technique, but like, how come you're just feeling like you are dead? Like I have never seen you.
SPEAKER_03: just going inside right away. I mean, with someone you like really good, try to do your best to escape from there, you know, against the top hook puller, you know. It's because I just mastered armwrestling quite recently after I was defeated by Nord Olet. So everything before that doesn't really count. We start over from now on. So then I will set Makaro match and then he will directly boom inside. And then he will look at Makaro's face and he will do some bicep curls.
SPEAKER_03: turn and then finish with the tricep yeah yes exactly yeah okay so just you just tell us what jerry and um um jerry and hermes thing so uh let's say um 70 and 40 i'm going with jerry
SPEAKER_03: 1730 wow do you believe that do you believe that uh hermes is gonna you are one of those a few that gives the chance to more chance to jerry you know and do you believe that hermes is just gonna go like classic outside like this or do you think that he will have something
SPEAKER_03: prepared for jerry specifically for him because of his style because we know that everyone who goes like this against jerry they are in trouble he is just they are carrying all his uh all the pressure on the bracket idea as well jerry is all over it's hard to bring him here do you think that jerry is gonna go like classic top roll way or do you think that
SPEAKER_01: there is a chance that he may be bringing here something specifically for Jerry I would not be surprised if Hermes is getting ready to do something different but I don't think it matters I don't think he can just choose to do this new thing okay quickly okay so you are saying that you are saying that
SPEAKER_03: Hermes will probably bring something prepared for Jerry, but you say that it may be prepared, but to make it effective, you need
SPEAKER_03: enough time to master it like you yeah and also straight it requires and you say that Hermes's preparation will not be ready for yeah i don't think it will be enough yeah i don't think it'll be enough to move the match to his side i understand i understand
SPEAKER_03: yep that's interesting that's interesting and i think that jerry really likes that because you are someone who mastered the arm wrestling and then your opinion is about all of us yeah and basically i'm never wrong so yeah yeah you never wrong since after i don't have measure even before yes since uh
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he's just so interesting. He just said, you know, after he beat Sherka, so he said, last time I came here, you know, this and this, and then
SPEAKER_03: I went and then did everything, you know, how it should be. And now, today, I came and win, like Aydar Khan and Cerkasov with the same style, same type of puller, you know. Maybe you could have beaten Cerkasov even when you beat Aydar Khan, but you had to portray it that way, right, as a show. Let's not get into this, like, too deep. Like, I feel like we are going too deep now.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, let's just do it. Okay, okay, so, okay. You are the master, so I will just say whatever. Okay, so let's see how it will be. You guys want to say anything? Risto, you are still sure you're going to kick this guy's ass and then you're going to give a pause for his dreams and you will ruin his hopes for the
SPEAKER_02: title match i will not going to uh to make some show or something i just go there i beat him and i start to referring you know that will be you know i i i didn't i don't want to give him advantage to make some good matches i will just i will kill him that's all okay so you're gonna show people because i i i set your match i did the poster people are like oh that ref
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah. Don't listen. Don't scare the guy. He's not going to show up. Yeah. You know, I'm on vacation now. Just to show you my view on this. Right, right, right. Yeah, we are in Greece. And the only problem is I didn't eat good.
SPEAKER_03: You know, because I must lose my weight a little bit, but yeah, but you don't. But you don't regret that you're coming, right? You don't regret that you, you are losing weight right now. No, no, it's okay. It's okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I must lose my weight. You know, I am too fat. Yeah. Whenever, whenever, whenever I said your match people looks at the poster, they said, oh, that ref, you know, they say ref.
SPEAKER_03: They don't know that you are a world champion armwrestling. They don't know that you just took third place at the 85 kilo when you were like 80 kilo. And so they don't really know who you are. Are you also coming there to show people at the professional arena to show who you are? Yeah, I really want to show them because it's a lot of people didn't know it and they must just must to know it's I'm not so bad.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yeah. But can I ask you something? You are coming here as a referee all the time, but Minda was the only way him to come is as an athlete. Will you feel so guilty after you beat him that, you know, maybe he will miss the next event? A little bit. A little bit. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Kristo, what do you think? If I wanted to become a referee, do you think I could be better than you at refereeing? I don't know how you're refereeing. Come on, Kristo, just say yes. But you are a master, you will be perfect like a referee, I'm sure. So that's what I'm thinking. I have a suspicion that I'm most likely a better referee as well.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, probably. If he loses, are you not afraid that, you know, people will just bring this part of the conversation, you change after a match, you master the arm wrestling, and then they will just put this part, and then they just put the next thing, so he's beating you, and then this part. I don't lose. I don't lose. They will say he loses from some referee, you know.
SPEAKER_01: It's actually good that Christos seems to believe in himself a little bit here. It will make it feel better when I just kill that dream and he can go back to refereeing and everything is back to normal. So you're going to put everyone where they belong, at their place. Exactly.
SPEAKER_03: yeah at the beginning of the conversation you said that like you learn after a match and then you said you you're gonna be humble and this and that this is like this is exactly that's what i i was ready to be as humble as you can be right yeah okay there's no need to disrespect the referee okay okay
SPEAKER_03: Okay, guys, so it is only two weeks and then I will see you guys. I can't wait. I can't wait. I'm really confident. Tristo is also very confident. I know they both can be very dangerous. I don't know whose day it will be.
SPEAKER_03: whenever i say like this tristo gives me right he says yeah that's true engine but mindagos is looking at me with the eyes like you can't be serious you know that i'm gonna smoke the guy and he hardly holds himself you know to to not to say anything am i wrong i mean i was
SPEAKER_01: yes now we just have to be careful like we have to we need to really hope that crystal doesn't suddenly feel some elbow pain because it's very likely you know maybe he'll just turn the camera off and then he will text you ah my elbow is a little bit hurting now maybe i should not come there is a chance so i'm a little a little worried about that but that's the only thing my elbow was hurting a little bit after the
SPEAKER_02: uh european champions here we go here we go but not so much to not competing with you you know it's you know like my elbow i feel my pain my elbow like a match with daniel prokopchuk or something you know with you it's okay no problem little bit pain in the elbow no not big deal let's hope it doesn't increase
SPEAKER_03: Before we close, I will admit something. All those athletes that canceled their match, Yanis, Doug Ehrlich, and Makaro, in fact, there was no problem with them at all. They all were scared of you. And they all said, including Arthur, they said that, you know,
SPEAKER_03: like and you know like we really are not at his level he mastered the arm resting like can we all find like a reason excuse and save us you know they are like we made a mistake by saying yes to you but then later we sold you i'm not surprised level and yeah and then you are right the next thing aristo will do the same you know he privately told me this but you you already realized everything
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah he's a master yeah yeah yeah yeah don't give up crystal don't worry okay okay i i was gonna finish but is he really as confident as he he looks or he's just playing mind games crystal this guy he's playing my games he he
SPEAKER_02: at he he looked me i'm big you know and when does somebody is big he thinking oh probably he takes some steroids he's go bigger and bigger don't worry i didn't take nothing no no no i would my life i'm sure about that i'm on the level i'm on the level of the 75 kilo not different you know like a power um it's my my shape is the same almost all the time uh when you see the video how
SPEAKER_02: i competing with golemanov don't worry he injured his bites before one year and he's little bit you know he didn't pull so strong with me you know okay so you are not trying to call me so you you're trying to make me not worried right that's what it is don't worry i'm not so strong you know i will beat you but i'm not so strong to be scared of me you know
SPEAKER_03: he will he will beat you nicely he will beat you nicely he said that don't be like worried about getting injured or something he's not gonna smoke you he will beat you very gently is this what he's saying and he said he doesn't need to be so super strong to beat you yeah it was 2017 and then i saw this uh mindagos was hoping that he would meet you
SPEAKER_03: he's like he's like yeah maybe at some point i i'm not gonna pull the i hope i'm not gonna pull the history but i think it was it was not because it was not because he was afraid to lose but he knew that even if he won that would just take a lot away from him you understand like yeah yeah i think back when i was afraid of the king's move that's true yeah now not anymore
SPEAKER_01: not anymore yeah you even beat the armenian guy with the dead wrist you know like yeah so i have a very good training partner who is um replicating crystal style perfectly quite a good hook very strong hand little by little the biceps get tired he transitions into a king's move and then i can finish it with my flop wrist yeah his name tobias peterson
SPEAKER_01: Good. Yeah, one more question. Mindago, what is your chance to beat Hristo inside? I'm not telling you to go inside, but do you think that he can comfortably beat you inside? I... You doubt, right? It would... I'm not good at quickly finishing in the hook. I would need to make him work a little bit, and then I little by little overpower him. But you would beat him, right? You would still beat him? Yes, yes, of course.
SPEAKER_03: So there is no way he can beat you. He hooks you, he top rolls you. I don't know. That's what I'm saying. I don't see him pinning him. Yeah. All the options are close. Exactly. He can get in. Only hook. I will go only hook. Don't worry. I will not throw nothing. We will see about that.
SPEAKER_03: okay okay anyways guys i thank you very much this is all about the joke you know from my side at least that you know thank you thank you yeah i thank you guys and and i really can't wait this this is this interesting match and on the eyes of the community they know who mindagos is
SPEAKER_03: they don't know much about you, maybe 5% knows, because not everyone follows only WAF, you understand? They look at more like, you know, big events. And Mindaugas has been there. And so he looks heavily favored on the eyes of the community. So you have nothing to lose, Hristo. This guy has a lot to lose, so. Yeah, but I don't lose, so it doesn't matter. So it doesn't matter, okay. We'll see. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Take care, guys, and see you soon in two weeks. And thanks to everyone who has been watching us. Hopefully we will show you guys a great show. See you soon, Kirsten. See you soon. See you, see you. Bye-bye. Bye.
