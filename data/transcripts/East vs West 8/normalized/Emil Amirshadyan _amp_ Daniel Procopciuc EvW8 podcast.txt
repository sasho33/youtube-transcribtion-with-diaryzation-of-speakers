SPEAKER_03: Okay guys, sorry about that. Anyway, so this is an interesting match, and this is not only a super match, but this is, I will also mention when my guests come, this is a little bit personal. A little bit personal, but I will tell you guys. Ando gaming, it is important, yeah. You need to keep here and the backside of your shoulder, you know, very strong.
SPEAKER_04: So Mario, you think I look like 75, huh? Engin, thank you. Thank you, Richard. Thank you. This might end up being crazy as much of the cut. I'm telling you, there is something personal in this match.
SPEAKER_03: I will mention maybe now, maybe when they come, but it was 2018 when there was a big tournament in Moldova and there Emil and Daniel, they had a war, big war.
SPEAKER_03: Emil won, there was protest, they had to pull again and something like this, which at the end, Emil wasn't so happy about it. Um, and so, and right after the following year at the 2019 wars, Emil came and won the world championships over Daniel. And year before that, um,
SPEAKER_03: I think 2018 Emil also won over Daniel at the Europeans in Bulgaria. 2017 Daniel won. So these guys are very close, very close. And I remember having a conversation with Emil and he was not happy about his experience in Moldova. And so I will ask them, I will ask them,
SPEAKER_04: No, there will be a translator. Thank you, Akagami. Thank you, Chris. Thank you.
SPEAKER_04: Hello, world's strangest man. So this guy has had some kind of, you know, small issues.
SPEAKER_04: but let's see if anything anything left since that time to this time yeah this is for world title yeah yeah this is for 75 kilo wall panel um
SPEAKER_03: Alain Zoller barely beat Emil with right arm at the previous AMC. I don't think they met in the last one. It was close. Emil top rolled Alain Zoller and it was a very tough match as far as I remember.
SPEAKER_03: Hello, Pavlo. And who else came? Okay, Daniel. Daniel is here with Tiberio. Hello. Hello, Daniel. Hello, Tiberio. Hello, Pavlo. How are you? Good. I have no opinion about the matches, no predictions.
SPEAKER_03: Daniel, I'm sitting there. So we are waiting. Do you guys hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Can you speak again? Yes. Why do I hear you barely? Yeah, now I think I turned the sound on. Can you hear me?
SPEAKER_03: How are you, Pavlo? We didn't see each other for what, two days? Two days. It's too long. Unacceptable. We have to see each other every day. I don't know why. I cannot hear you. Daniel, do you hear me? Yes, I hear you. Everything is fine. I cannot hear you guys somehow. We can hear each other very good. Something on your end again. Hello.
SPEAKER_03: Daniel, are you speaking Russian and Moldovan? Yes, yes. Okay, okay. Do you speak English a little bit too? A little bit, I understand. Okay, now I understand. If you don't need it, just say no. Okay? Emil should be coming any moment. So, how are you, Daniel? Good?
SPEAKER_03: good good good yeah okay uh very soon i think emil will join us very soon i think any moment let me see if you send a message or something by what's up yeah and so daniel i was telling uh to the people here that
SPEAKER_03: there is a little personal between you and emil so daniel says he wants first of all he wants the title and second of all he wants revenge
SPEAKER_03: so uh yeah yeah yeah i think i think you want revenge um i remember emily's winning your category probably in 2018 uh europeans in bulgaria and 2019 romania yeah it was the last time you guys met and then you you won against him in 2017 hungary
SPEAKER_03: yeah hungry yeah and so i after you you had a match with him in moldova the the big tournament in moldova 2018 you and him had a long match long match you know you were like this he was like this and then i remember after that he was very upset
SPEAKER_03: And I remember that he made it. It was like, to me, it was a little bit personal after that match. And so I think you go in there for the title and for the revenge, while I think he also has something left from 2018 Moldova for you.
SPEAKER_03: Daniel said probably it's because he injured his arm a little then you know because in his match with Daniel he injured his arm
SPEAKER_03: But I think not only about the injured arm, I think he was not happy with the referee decisions as well. This is what I remember. Maybe, maybe. Yeah, he is asking me, I mean, I've never used Zoom before.
SPEAKER_03: so he's hopefully coming anyway so follow how how have you been last two days i didn't hear you when you talk the the sound was not on i think no very very good very good all the preparations
SPEAKER_04: yeah good good good hello emil you hear us do you hear me you need to click on the um you hear me now
SPEAKER_03: Hello. Not yet. I think he needs to press on the press on the Wi Fi and data, you know, to hear the sound to get the sound. No, I think there is something that he needs to press on, but he needs to press the screen. And maybe
SPEAKER_04: i sent him um so let me send him this so maybe he can see now
SPEAKER_03: And I'll figure out how to... You need to press the screen to see those options to turn. You hear us, Emil? Good. That's good. Yeah. How are you, Emil? Good?
SPEAKER_02: How is your shape? To be honest, it's not the complete peak, but it's not bad. It's not bad. Is it good enough to beat Daniel?
SPEAKER_02: He said to be honest, I think it may not, but it depends how it's going to start from the beginning.
SPEAKER_02: So he is coming there with health hearted, right? About winning. So you come and you have doubts about your victory, right? Well, I'm not afraid, of course. I don't have that. This is probably my first plus. I know that the opponent is not afraid either.
SPEAKER_02: And very rarely such opponents as Daniel, that he also always fights with spirit. And about me, what I am afraid of, there is also no such thing. And I will try to do everything.
SPEAKER_03: yeah he said no i'm i'm not i'm not afraid of anything and i know that daniel uh is not afraid and he said we will see i will i will do everything uh to you know to win so we'll see yeah yeah emil can you turn your camera yeah yeah thank you thank you yeah um
SPEAKER_03: I was, I was just before, before Emil came, I was trying to steer the pot while saying that there is a little beef from 2018 Moldova match. Uh, does he feel like, uh, it is a little, a little personal and Daniel said that he's coming for a title and for revenge or last time that they met.
SPEAKER_03: Engin says that after your fight in Moldova in 2018, Engin thinks that it all became a little personal. Daniel said that he comes to take the title. Well, what about the rematch? After Daniel's fight, I have a right hand.
SPEAKER_02: I was injured, as everyone probably knows. After that, I can't restore my right hand. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. But my left side works better at 90 degrees than the right side.
SPEAKER_03: okay uh he said yeah that after the match uh he cannot uh he cannot uh heal completely the right side right arm unfortunately but his left side is working much better in that 90 degree angle
SPEAKER_03: What did you say about that match? I'm talking about like, is it any little personal for him this match or not? Yes, he did not answer that, let me ask again. Do you feel that it's a bit personal between you now, a rematch or not?
SPEAKER_02: That is, how exactly? What do you personally feel a little bit that you need to come and win, that it's a little bit like that, not only a sport interest, but something like that? Well, that, let's say, each other, as it were, have something bad, wish each other, I wouldn't say, but what I think the left, yes, let's say, is now considered, as it were, you can say,
SPEAKER_03: he said that no no there is no nothing like you know like we are enemies or something but he said that uh yeah left side is very interesting and he think it's going to be a very good match
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I hope so. I hope so. Did Justin remember? Daniel, do you remember how many times you guys pull in the same category? 2017 Hungary, 2018 Bulgaria and 2019 WAF and then Moldova events. In Bulgaria, he didn't.
SPEAKER_03: He didn't fall because he had different route. I know, I know, but you were in the same category, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And did they meet in 2016 or no? No, no. Only 2017, 18 European, 19 WAF, and then Moldova. Yeah. So four times, four events, yeah. Okay. And yeah, and with left arm?
SPEAKER_03: that those categories two times Emil won and two times you won. You won in Moldova left arm, and you won... Yeah, after 2018 Bulgaria, Emil won the category, 2018 Moldova.
SPEAKER_03: Daniel won the category. You beat Chertasov, right, in 2018 in Moldova? Those four times you were in the same category, two times Daniel won the category, and two times Emil. See, I know better than you guys do. Emil, you always know better than us. Yeah, they don't have to meet in the same category. They are in the same category, so it means that...
SPEAKER_03: I'm live on YouTube, can we talk later?
SPEAKER_00: so uh um daniel says uh um
SPEAKER_03: he won one time and Emil won another one because they only faced in the other events they didn't face
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah. As a general, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, it doesn't matter. In general, it turns out that physically you fought only once, he won once, you won once, right? No, no, no, no. Let me remember everything clearly. Let me tell you how it was. In general, in 2017, at the World Championship, I won with my left hand, but no.
SPEAKER_02: It was WAF, right? WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF. WAF.
SPEAKER_02: No? No, you say it yourself. I don't know, it wasn't there until the end. Then I got injured and the match stopped. No, it didn't stop, this match continued. Well, then you need to make an arpati on the right, to look at it. No, it's not about that, just to be honest.
SPEAKER_02: I won one more fight in Moldova. Then we fought again. Then I got injured. And it also went to the pillow. Anyway, the injury touched the pillow. And then in 2019, we had a fight with the left hand.
SPEAKER_03: So there is some confrontation about Moldova event because Emil thinks that he won a right hand match before he was injured with Daniel. There's a little confrontation because Daniel says, come on, you get injured and you did not finish. And Emil said, but I won the actual match.
SPEAKER_03: so uh and then 19 uh worlds uh emil one left yeah emil one left yeah emil will left and i think emil took what second place to check us off i mean i know
SPEAKER_03: Who was second? Who was first? Emil was first in 19. No, no, no. I'm talking about right arm. Where was it? Was it Georgi? Second place was Georgi? He said no, he never pulled in Georgi.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, no, I mean, first was Sharkatov with ranker bravo. And who was second? Oh, no. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I think I think I mean, lost to Murat Murat Warhan. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was tough category. It was just like nightmare. Huge category, you know, just like
SPEAKER_03: People underestimate the lightweights. This is like the highest quality. I'm listening to the names and I don't want to pull that category with my weight right now. What's that?
SPEAKER_03: I'm listening to the first three, and I don't want to pull that category with my weight right now. No, you are too strong for them. You are just being so polite and nice. And what does Emil say? He's saying something, but... No, Emil's saying that we made the first three pretty much every time with Daniel. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand, yeah. Yeah. It was interesting. Top category, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Let's see how it will be. Emil, when you went to AMC tournament, did you do any side table with left arm with Alan? Did you do any sparring?
SPEAKER_02: No, they didn't do any of the pulling. And can you ask Emil right now, his right or left feels better?
SPEAKER_03: so he said it depends which part uh let's say uh fingers and the wrist right is better right uh if we're talking about the angle the actual yeah then it's left better yeah tell tell him that he exactly has what he needs to pull daniel with left arm
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, because right arm, right arm, Daniel can go this way, but left arm is only inside, Daniel. Yeah, so you need this angle against Daniel with left arm.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it will be a good match. It will be a good match. Yeah, I cannot wait. And can you ask Daniel Tiberiu, what does he think? What's his chance of winning? How comfortable, how confident he is right now? I don't know. I haven't lost to anyone since 2020. I don't know what my level is now.
SPEAKER_03: So it's a little tricky because from 2020, he didn't lost with the left arm. So I mean, he doesn't have any competition. So he doesn't know exactly what's the level. He only knows it's above anybody else that he faced.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think I need to do some provocation here. I need to do some provocation, tell him that he didn't lose since 2019, it's because since then he didn't meet Emil.
SPEAKER_03: I'm joking. Tell him that I'm just trying to provoke, you know. Yeah, yeah. Daniel said that he hasn't lost since 2020, so he doesn't know at what level he is. We'll see. I want to ask Daniel a question. It's interesting to me.
SPEAKER_03: Emil asking Daniel how many percent over the last three years he gained. Daniel says he doesn't feel like he's...
SPEAKER_03: He doesn't feel really he's progressing, you know, but at competitions, you know, he always delivers with the left.
SPEAKER_03: What does he say? Daniel says it's hard for him to give a percentage. Mostly because we're mostly training at the table. Yeah, hard to calculate.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Weight wise, like with weights, I think he says he progressed a little.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, but in armwrestling, the weights are... You don't know how it translates, you know, to the... Yeah, that's what it is, you know. For armwrestling to be more effective, it is all about the coordination of the muscle groups that makes you stronger, but you cannot calculate, you cannot know how much it's better, but it makes so much difference.
SPEAKER_03: Because you may have very strong here, very strong here, but if no coordination, then you cannot affect, you cannot bring the gym numbers to the table. But once you coordinate, which is not countable, you don't know 10%, 15%, you don't know, but he is for sure more experienced. How old are you, Daniel? 27 or 28? 28. 28.
SPEAKER_03: Let me translate to Emil. Give me just one second, because Emil doesn't understand. Okay, yeah, also you can ask him his age as well. He says it's hard to say in percent, because he mostly works at the table. He says he has progressed a little in weight. There is a small progress in weight in the gym, but there is definitely progress at the table, because he gained experience, he constantly works at the table. He says, well, I can't say how many percent he works at the table.
SPEAKER_03: 30. What's that? 30 years old. 30 years old, 30. Yeah, so they both are very young and then they are still at their best years, still progressing up. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And can we ask him the same question? How much did you progress since 2019? Do you have any numbers in your head about your progress? How much have you progressed, Emil, since 2018, for example? Well, about Paranator, I've changed a little bit. I'm still in the grip.
SPEAKER_02: he said on the left arm he doesn't know he didn't pull for a little long uh for a couple years but uh he said that pronator and the grip is progressing pretty well
SPEAKER_03: I understand but but his left arm is very healthy right now because he didn't really push so much like in a competition. He said that left was never injured really so yes.
SPEAKER_03: And, and can you, can you ask him how important he is for him is to win this title match, this world title match? Because, because East versus West, as you realize, like Daniel is the current world champion of 75 kilo. Adair Khan is current world champion of 75 kilo in WAF and also in, uh, East versus West. And then we have Atlas like, like Sasho.
SPEAKER_03: Ongarbe, Devon Larratt, Ermes Gasparini, Jerry, and Alican Murado, Gabriela, Barbara, Artem Morozov. So this is, in my opinion, the heaviest title right now in the world. So how important is it for Emil to win this title?
SPEAKER_03: Emil asks, how important is it for you to win this title on East vs. West? Because Engin has listed all the names, you've heard them, I won't repeat them. And he says, it's probably the heaviest title in the world today. So he asks, how important is this title for you now?
SPEAKER_02: It's more important, I think, than, let's say, going through this championship. Well, for me especially, because even a month ago, when I fought, I realized that I wasn't as ready as I wanted to be, because I felt good. But there were moments in the AMC, yes.
SPEAKER_02: I understood that I didn't work at all, but I understood it now. The next time I go, I don't know if I'll make it in September. This time I'll try to be in good shape with my right hand. And now, yes. I don't know, I don't have any pain. I feel good.
SPEAKER_02: Now it's interesting who will win. You can say that the first number in the world is considered, although there is another athlete from Ossetia. Daniel knows. If, for example, Daniel wins. What's his name? Zaloev. If Daniel wins for me, then he deserves to fight him.
SPEAKER_02: If I, for example, am worthy to fight, and I don't know about the left hand, about Adair Khan, then it will be clear who is the strongest in the world up to 75 kg.
SPEAKER_03: so he's saying for sure it's much more important for him than uh AMC tournament which he attend well he said that he is it's good that he pulled a right arm and he knows you know uh where he's at approximately but he said
SPEAKER_03: left is not injured left is feeling very good and he said for sure after this match uh we will know who is a true champion uh of the world and who is the best in this category because this is the best event uh but uh he said there is another athlete in asetia in russia
SPEAKER_03: who in his opinion uh the winner of this match have to face him and then it's gonna be yeah can you tell him that i offer alan zola but he said that he is in like military academy or something he cannot get out of russia as on air and you understand right emil yeah
SPEAKER_03: if he gets out he will directly pull world title match right and left against who the title owner but as soon as he he can get out but as of now we cannot do anything because he cannot come so that that is the only problem but anyone who deserves like we will invite him no no no no matter like for me
SPEAKER_03: These are all brothers and sisters in our nursing. You know, we don't care about from which country, where they are. You know, if you are the best, you will be invited. It's totally up to you to accept or not accept. But yeah, it will be it will be great. And maybe, maybe. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Danya, if you win this match, who do you think that you should be pulling?
SPEAKER_03: if Alan cannot come? He wants the champion for 85. Oh, so he would want to pull the winner of 85. Who does he think they will be?
SPEAKER_03: does he think that target is going to win the waft with left arm does he think yeah yeah and is he is he really ready to pull target yeah yeah you're ready wow wow it will be incredible it will be incredible yeah yeah and
SPEAKER_03: If Emil wins, I think Emil is going to stick with 75 kilos because his weight is like barely around there, 75 kilos. I don't think he would want to pull 85 kilos, but we will see. So, Daniel, your eyes are on 85 as well at the same time, huh? Your eyes. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Daniel, I have a question for you.
SPEAKER_03: do you think do you think that i have if i come back do you think i have any chance at all at 85 kilo like just say that now who's gonna pull wala is gonna pull samusha in august 7 for the world title 85 kilo do you think that do you think that if i can come back somehow do you think any chance for me for 85 or no chance at all
SPEAKER_03: So, Daniel says, if you really want it, you will certainly get it because you are like,
SPEAKER_03: a tough minded person that really gets what he wants you know so you have to really want it to really want to come back you know for real i really want but that's why i have potential at this age in this condition yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay so he he is he trying to make me happy or he really believes that no no no no no
SPEAKER_03: okay okay yeah it will be great and i want to ask about the the other matches uh i want to ask first match only as an uh percentage nothing no no comments first i want to ask daniel by the percentage only what is the percentage you give yourself against emil
SPEAKER_03: he said 50 50. wow i don't believe him you don't believe him right because you know you know how he really feels right you don't believe him because you know how he feels really
SPEAKER_03: No, I don't know how he feels, you know, but I know how strong he is, you know, and with the left and what's found for found, you know, so. Yeah, rock, rock. I should say rock or steel, steel I should say. Can you ask the same question to him, Emil, and then by giving also answer of the Daniel? Rock.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, okay, these guys are
SPEAKER_03: I feel like being some politics, you know, not, not really giving the answer, you know, but it's okay. Yeah. It is normal from the Eastern guys. Eastern guys are more like, more like, I don't know, just, they like to keep their feelings inside or maybe they really feel that way. And let, let's talk about some, some big matches also, uh, probably they may not have opinion about every match, but I will ask.
SPEAKER_03: Like, what do you think about Wagner, Bortolato, Farid Osmanli, Emil? It's a left, right? It's a left hand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Farid, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Valeriy Pyakin'ki, he said that if it's right, but left probably for each week, he will apply his preparation. Valeriy Pyakin'ki, I understand, so he's thinking that if very prepared himself good enough, yes chance to win and Daniel.
SPEAKER_03: So he said Farid because the left is more fresh, more uninjured and he's fighting at home also. But he will have to really stay away from the press, you know, of Wagner. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: and i will ask like this one only to daniel justin bishop versus thompson he he said he doesn't really know the the form of justin bishop because he put on a little bit of weight recently you know
SPEAKER_03: but he thinks slightly favorite is um thomas uh the way the way he he was at the european championship you know because we we saw him his left arm uh performed better than his right yeah yeah yeah yeah and and can you ask emil about the the mindagas versus
SPEAKER_03: I think this match will be very interesting. We will fight together all the time.
SPEAKER_03: Which one do you think has more endurance? Because it's going to be a very hard match.
SPEAKER_03: yeah either way but based on endurance so no uh easy match like uh everybody thinks uh-huh i understand and let's go to the uh petrenko versus chance show does emil know chance show
SPEAKER_03: What do you think, Daniel? Yeah, Petrenko. Petrenko is going to win? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He said Petrenko, and he said he pulled at the side table with him, so he really, he knows how strong he is, so he was very impressed by his strength and hand strength. He's talking about Petrenko, he pulled with him side table? Yeah. When did he pull him? Recently?
SPEAKER_03: He pulled with his right arm or left arm? Left arm. But this match is right arm. He said he thinks both arms are equal.
SPEAKER_03: sort of so okay i understand and what does he think about reno versus terence does he know terence openman so he doesn't know the the shape terence
SPEAKER_01: uh is going to come in because he didn't pull for a while and reno is a very he's on a on a roll right now you know so he tends to favor reno okay i understand and what does he think about paulo versus andres but just tell him remember paulo is here
SPEAKER_00: So he better be careful. What arm? The right? Right arm? Yeah, right arm, yeah. So he said...
SPEAKER_03: He trains with Sabine, so if Pavlo will come with the same shape he was with Sabine, he has every chance to win Sandris. If he has the same form, the same shape, he has the chance to win, 100%.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, he has chance 100% meaning chance or he has chance for sure. Uh, I mean, he, he, he would be favorite, you know, favorite. Okay. So Pavlo, you will be in better shape than when you pull against. Plus 5% plus 5%. Okay. Okay. So you, you can, you can measure better because you, you are a gym guy, huh? Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: yeah always unfortunately i always measure by my uh gym performances not by my table performance unfortunately and and emily what do you think about gennady versus morozov emil gennady morozov right
SPEAKER_02: He said Gennady is unpredictable sometimes too, but he thinks that Morozov is slightly favored, 55 to 45. 55 to 45? And what do you think, Dania?
SPEAKER_03: So he says it's depending the style. If Morozov will pull outside, he will win, but he would like to see
SPEAKER_03: uh a match inside because he thinks he's going to be very uh balanced you know very tough match can go either way in hook inside does daniel think that i mean if morozov would go outside and win why would he go out inside like when you say that if he goes outside he's gonna win it doesn't mean that he can he can he can for sure top roll him
SPEAKER_03: or if he can couple him what what they mean i didn't understand so the thing is you know one thing is the game plan you know so maybe uh the first match you know but it's a super match
SPEAKER_03: so down the line gennady can can force the cooking stop you know with with a little bit of shoulder you know so um then the match will be interesting so the match will get interesting once gennady will will manage to to get the match inside so okay and then then inside so sorry so uh percentages inside
SPEAKER_03: So 60-40 Morozov inside. So hook inside 50-50 and outside 60-40 Morozov. Okay, so he said that if they go hook,
SPEAKER_03: He doesn't know he's going to win that match. If it goes strapped, big possibility Gennady will force him inside. I cannot wait that match either. I really don't know. On the paper, Morozov young, healthier, but whenever you look at... Great shape right now. Yeah, and Gennady, also you don't know. You cannot underestimate him. Any moment he can do something crazy. Both guys have great endurance. This is the...
SPEAKER_02: And can you ask Emil, what does he think about Jerry vs. Ermes? Well, Jerry vs. Ermes. I think Ermes will win. Because apart from the top, he also works with the triceps. And against such a technique as Jerry, which he holds,
SPEAKER_02: gives the brush and so on, this triceps works well against this technique, so the couple is very interesting, as it were, chosen, but I think that when the brush will open, the rms will not be able to go with its top, I think so, you need to add another triceps there, without it, I don't think so with him,
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Okay, yeah, he thinks that Ermes is going to win because he has not only the top role, which may not work with Jerry, with his position, but he also has very good triceps. We saw that at King of the Table. Yeah, yeah. Ermes got it. You're right, yeah. I mean, you're right about not Ermes got it, but about the shoulder pressure, yeah, he has it, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: About the other one, I don't know who is it. Daniel? Yes, he has every chance to win against Ermes if he starts quickly. But if Jerez takes his position and passes there, he will tire the pronator. The pronator will tire the pronator faster than the press. So, Ermes has a better chance to win if he gets a good start?
SPEAKER_03: because if jerry gets in uh in his position the pronator and the back pressure muscle will will always fatigue faster than the tricep and the the joint strength you know joint pressure you know so um just airmen has to keep jerry out of his position you know
SPEAKER_03: I know what he has to do, but what is the possibility that he will do that and win? Can you repeat, sorry? No, I mean, everyone knows that he needs to not to go that position, but what is the chance?
SPEAKER_01: possibly he that he will he will be able to do that this is what i am asking here so jerry's also
SPEAKER_03: fast you know he's not a slow puller you know uh at the start but he he he thinks you know 55 45 air mass yeah because it's it's easier it's easier to to get the top wall because of the shoulder uh position you know with the press you have to change the shoulder position to to to really get inside so you have a slight uh um uh delay okay
SPEAKER_03: Okay, I understand. And Daniel can top roll, hook, and even press with no risk. Whenever I see a match, if the top roller is pulling against a dead wrist pressure, a top roller is pulling against a hook puller, my mind is always working that what the top roller needs to do, you know, because I feel closer there because of my technique. In this match,
SPEAKER_03: Daniel, where does he feel himself closer? Since he can top roll and he can deal with pressure, he can apply both what Ermes is doing and Jerry is doing.
SPEAKER_03: so how does he feel like if he sees that match his mind will be more like doing empathy you know to which side you understand my point yeah yeah yeah i'm going to explain so which is
SPEAKER_00: As a style, who do you think you could win against? I have never seen such a strong finish as Georgi Karsapiea, to push so hard with... I always try to pull him from behind so I can give him more pressure. I can't put that on Georgi's feet.
SPEAKER_03: so he said it's hard to put himself in the position of jerry because he he not he he never lets the wrist go 100 like jerry he always tries to to get on the opponent's pronator to to to to activate the the wrist even if it's a little bit uh
SPEAKER_03: lost you know he's still trying to you know so he he uh he empathized more with with the top hole you know like uh okay so he doesn't find his style so close to jerry's yeah no no because he the position may be may be similar you know but jerry rely relies a lot on like giving the the
SPEAKER_03: the risk completely you know to get the position you know when you are saying that daniel even his this goes he still tries to curl it he's still exactly he still tries to put pressure here you know he still tries to to get the back pressure you know to to to open uh the guy's pronation i understand there is a super shed for daniel thank you does daniel see himself as one of the best
SPEAKER_01: lightweight puller all time one of the best i mean in the history whole history because he's himself like one of the best ever
SPEAKER_03: So he still wants a few guys, you know, to beat, you know, to really, because every tournament, you know, there are guys, good guys missing, you know. Can I say my opinion about him? My opinion, I think left arm, he already proved. I think right arm, he needs to do a little bit more.
SPEAKER_01: The right hand is...
SPEAKER_03: Like, it's a work in progress, but... Yeah, yeah. So, for the first time in a lot of time, you know, Daniel thinks the right is actually better than the left right now. Yeah, but there are, like, much more, like, world titles with left. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. So, we can say that left is a little bit more dominant, but right in competition may be
SPEAKER_03: more difficult so he gets tired and last year he had a long match with Mindaugas and he was very close but left arm he was more dominant yeah anyway so anyway so okay guys I I thank you very much and in 10 days not 10 days in one week one week I will see you guys yeah one week wow another one is coming
