SPEAKER_02: Hey, what's up? Yeah, I hear you. Yes, that's it. Yeah, but now you did that. It started. We are live now.
SPEAKER_00: Tired. How are you? Tired. It is because I had a tough training and then I came home before even I ate. I had a podcast with Denis Shplenko, Morozov. You watch?
SPEAKER_00: Guys, you write like Jordan Sonev is banned by East versus West. That is not true. Justin like, please, just like stop doing this kind of nonsense. Jordan Sonev has problems with Bulgarian Federation. That is their internal problem. It has nothing to do with East versus West. So stop spreading, you know, like this kind of
SPEAKER_00: untrue, you know, like propaganda, just stop doing it. Okay. Justin respect East versus West, like either poke with facts, truth, or just shut your mouth, you know, and because I'm sick of it, I'm trying to motivate myself to serve you guys more, more, more, more. And then you guys just go there with just like, listen, I wasn't going to go into this thing, but let me go when.
SPEAKER_00: I want to ask them, 2018, when Krasimir also had a problem with Asten, where was, they are my good friends. I would even consider them like brothers, Gachevski, Clement. I know Gachevski for 30 years, Jordan. You know, these are like brothers to me, but it has nothing to do with me. So don't involve me.
SPEAKER_00: When you don't say that it is, you can say banned by WAF. He cannot compete, but don't say banned by East versus West or something. Justin use your words like more carefully. Okay. Justin say as it is. Like five years ago, when Krasimir was also complaining about ASEAN, where did Gachevsky, Blemen and Jordan stand? With ASEAN or with Krasimir?
SPEAKER_00: They stood with us and so they they complain and they want everyone to be on their side, it is. i'm not saying this side is right, this side is wrong, it is their internal problem internal problem, I have nothing to do with it, so just keep me away.
SPEAKER_00: I know this is a false propaganda from some people who are jealous of East versus West. So they use every opportunity to throw mud and I'm sick of it. These people are enemy of our message. I'm telling you. Every opportunity they find something negative and they try to involve. Justin keep it away. East versus West. I try to serve our message. You enjoy, you're more than welcome. I will be serving.
SPEAKER_00: You wanna pull me to do your mud? Don't do that, okay? Justin stay away. I finally, after decades, like brought East, West together, trying to do something good, okay? Anyone who is trying to harm this, I'm sick of it. Every event, everything, they find something and then they go to do,
SPEAKER_00: Facebook pages and then groups and then like, they like, like a bitches, you know, they, they, they do every time they find something else. These people, I'm telling you openly, enemies of our medicine. They are enemy that happens every good thing in our medicine. Trust me. Trust me. These people are enemies of our medicine. I see. No, I mean, listen, they will be, they will evolve, but let me address them.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes, but I'm not saying... Listen, Ermes, I know they exist. I don't have a problem with their existence, but I am also going to address those people. If they are throwing mud, I will also address them, what they are, how they are.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, every opportunity they find, they look at it, they see 100 positive things. And then they are like, they see one thing negative. They are like, oh, did you see that? Did you see that? You understand these people are unhappy people, you know, just let them stay away. We focused on arm wrestling, real arm wrestling. Why can we not, oh, why can we not see you in the chat?
SPEAKER_00: They said that they cannot... No, they don't see you. I see you, but they don't see you. Why is that? No? No, no, I see you, but the people on chat, they don't see you.
SPEAKER_00: Did you enter with your YouTube account? Did you go with your password YouTube account? No, no, you had to enter with your YouTube account as far as I know. Okay, maybe you get out and then you come with your, when you enter, I think you need to enter with your, I think YouTube account.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, I met someone from, like, they are like, oh, you know, East versus West, Ben, Jordan, and this. I mean, I invited Jordan. You remember? He pulled against Katashins. And, okay. Okay, but now... One second. Now he's with my YouTube account. Same as before.
SPEAKER_00: First one was this. OK, yeah, you came. Good, good, good, good, good. Yeah. We are happy to see you. People, people talked it on the chat that I was talking with them. OK, now, yeah. I think it is good.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. How are you feeling? Super power, my friend. Super power? Super. You're going to show your forearm like this. Of course it looks big. When you look like this. Because the camera is too small, my friend. Camera is too small, right? Yeah. You cannot show your forearm. If you compare it like this, you see the difference. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: My weight is a little bit less, but... Only quality. The size is the same, all quality, best quality there than ever. You know how you sound when you start, like, all quality? You are like trying to sell a product or something. My friend, it's very high quality. You know, trust me, you won't be disappointed, you know? Very funny.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah training a lot and i'm very good shape now yeah yeah yeah yeah salesman you are a salesman yeah lagia said it yeah lagia is my savior lagia is one of my best supporter okay so did you hear what dennis said you watched the whole program or no
SPEAKER_00: He's angry with Devon. But did you hear the part that he was talking about you? No. He said that if Devon doesn't pull him, he would like to pull you. But he said that many times he offered you, but you were scared of him. Is that true? No, I've heard many messages from him, but I'm too scared to respond.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he never said that, you know. I'm scared to respond. I don't want to play with him. When he won, it's very big. I have a lot of respect for Denis.
SPEAKER_00: Whenever he wants, I'm ready for him. He's one of my dream mates, you know, like with John Brzezinski. Ermes, you know that I'm joking, right? He never said that. Yeah, yeah, no, no. I don't want to misunderstand it. There is Spermis. Thank you for your super chat. He says, Jerry will crush you, my friend. Who? His name is Spermis. Jerry will crush you. Jerry?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Jerry will crush you, my friend. My friend, we will see, we will see. Yeah. I don't understand why the people, they say they underestimated, really underestimated Jerry, but it's not true. Yeah. They say this because every time you said you're going to break his bone, you're going to do this. Yeah, yeah, for sure, but...
SPEAKER_01: I will come more stronger than the last time with Lewa. Every time. So your shape will be better than your shape that was against Lewa? For sure, 100%. For sure, yeah? Yeah. Wow. Every six months or one year, my power will grow up. Yeah. Look one year ago. Yeah?
SPEAKER_00: No, one year and a half ago when I fought with Matt Mask and now. When you beat Matt Mask was exactly two years ago. Two years ago, yeah. Yeah, June 12th, 2021, when I injured my bicep. Yeah, yeah, I remember. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_00: I kind of feel that you're going to go out and then Jerry is going to put the whole building on your arm and then the rest is just dark. A dark night for you. We'll see, we'll see because he has only this option with me. But it's against everyone.
SPEAKER_01: His problem, like Ermes, he has only one technique. And he's not smart to do another technique. He can do only this. But he's winning. Not very good winning. We will see. We will see. I kind of feel that after the event, I'm going to ask you, what happened, Ermes?
SPEAKER_01: You're going to like, no idea. I don't know how it happened. Oh, I am very curious to pull with him. I want to, when I squeeze his hand there, I want to see him, his face will change immediately. Ooh. Yeah, yeah. Wow. Without straps.
SPEAKER_01: See, that is the speed. I squeeze his wrist like, you know, when you put a lemon inside. Like a sponge? Yeah, yeah. Yeah? And he could do nothing with the wrist, with the arm. Yeah, but he gives the wrist anyway. He doesn't give a shit. No, no, no. I block it here. I want to see what he wants to do. Nothing. Listen, you be careful, huh?
SPEAKER_00: You may be holding so tight that whenever he hits you, you will be boom to the pad, you know. You be careful. Mario says, Mario says, Ermes, new East versus West champion, my friend. They see the future, my friend.
SPEAKER_00: uh yeah you know people says that jerry wins ugly because he wants to create very bad feelings with his opponent very ugly memories you know he wanted you said that you know jerry wins but not not pretty you know you said ugly you understand you said something like this not good or something you just said five minutes ago and i think that you know he wins in a very ugly way
SPEAKER_00: So that this creates very bad memories, ugly memories on his opponent. Like Devon. No, I was just trying to tease you. Like after he beats you, you will be just remembering like, how did he beat me? You know, like I had everything, everything. In this mind, there are no these options, my friend. I have the server here. You know, they don't look this.
SPEAKER_00: Do you know why he doesn't read? Because you never experienced such thing before. Never. You will have new memories after this match. Yeah, every time. Yeah, so he will create them.
SPEAKER_00: You are the only guy that I tease like this. If anyone else, they would think like, oh. But with you, I always say, Dave is going to crush you. This guy is going to crush you. I hope, really, I hope because I show many people they believe in me, in my victory.
SPEAKER_00: But sometimes I hope in the opposite way. Because I need more motivation, more, more, you know, like with Levan. For the fight. Yes, but you said sometimes you need this motivation. But when you pull Levan, people say that Levan is going to destroy you. Yeah, but for me it's better. For me it's better. Yeah, I understand. But when you are tough,
SPEAKER_01: I understand. But yes, now I want to come every time stronger than before. Every time. Because I want to revenge with Lewandowski when he comes back. I will be ready stronger than last time with him.
SPEAKER_00: After this match, how do you think that it's going to be between Jerry and Levan, the title match, next match, after this match, East versus West title? After? Yeah, after this match, how do you think that it will be Jerry versus Levan, the title match? It's not going to happen? No, possibly. No? No possible, eh?
SPEAKER_01: No, no. Because for me, if I close here, I never lose when my wrist is closed, when I have the power here. And now sometimes, now with Levan, I block him like this, but when I have the control here, yeah, I understand there is...
SPEAKER_00: another technique, but... I don't have only top players. I can do pressure, I can do... Do you see any danger of him beating you? Do you think it's possible if you make a mistake? Yes, for sure. Or do you think that no matter what you do, you will beat him? No, no, no. I know
SPEAKER_01: If I wait for him and he pulls and he pulls in this position with his shoulder like this, it's very dangerous for everybody. We are talking about the top five in the world in the rankings. It's impossible to score without problems.
SPEAKER_01: and yeah we needed to do uh the moment to do the best technique to see the movement there are many things to do it's like now it's like to to play a video game you know if you if you put a a wrong button you lose if you put a good water you win
SPEAKER_01: understand this label yeah yeah so you are saying that you need to you need to make right choices you need to make right choices when you are yeah i will go prep we prepare 100 with many options to do many techniques and now i do cardio more than than last time for for to have
SPEAKER_00: more endurance and my training is a little bit different. Yeah. Every time. What I understand from the things you are saying that you realize that he is very, very strong, very, very dangerous, but you believe in your abilities that you have more than he has, you know.
SPEAKER_00: That's why you're going to win. Not because you think he's not strong. You are saying he's very, very strong. But you are saying that you have tools. You have power to find a way for your victory. That's what you're saying. Yeah. I don't underestimate him. I don't want to do this big mistake. This level is better than don't do this.
SPEAKER_00: In fact, you say things like you're going to crash him or something, but you have big respect for him. That's what I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a good guy. Everybody in this community, we have respect with everybody. Yeah, but you call him Cadorette. Cadorette?
SPEAKER_01: What's that mean? Cadorette, what's that mean in Italian? Cadorette is like to go in the toilet. Are you serious? Yeah. But it's not offensive. It's only a joke. Okay. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: now now jerry's gonna crush you after the same yeah the people like this new name a lot people likes it but let's see if jerry likes it yeah you know jerry jerry is old enough experienced enough to bring
SPEAKER_00: there his best and I am I see that you know he's coming like like I'm sure he's gonna come there with his best ever shape and let's see you if you make mistakes he will make you pay the price bitterly trust me yeah anyway so what do you think about Dave Chaffee and Devon this 25th of uh 24th of June Dubai
SPEAKER_02: I think he's frozen. Or I am frozen.
SPEAKER_00: Ermes is still thinking. I think I asked him very, very tough question. That is why tournament of champions, East versus West tournament. Anything is possible, Marco, anything. I'm still trying to
SPEAKER_00: I don't know why you are so frozen. Now? You look frozen. To me, yes. I mean, to me, you look frozen. Because with telephone it's not good. One moment. Get out and come back, yeah. If I beat Ray, who do I want to arm myself? Hmm.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know much. Let me put on the next one. Now I realize what a big pressure it is to ask the next machine. Yeah. Battery is very low. Oh, okay. I understand. I understand. Yeah. With this program, I can't do it with my computer.
SPEAKER_01: They will come stronger than super strong, but I don't think it will come like Hulk. Who is it? There are limits of genetics, my friend. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Before you left, I asked you, how do you think about Devon versus Dave Sheffield?
SPEAKER_01: I think the first and maybe the second round, Chafee will go very close to win. But I think Devon will do what he needs to do. I have a question for you. If Davies hits and Devon just stops him right here.
SPEAKER_00: And if Dave switches the shoulder pressure as he did to Vitaly. There are good possibilities. Yeah. There are very good possibilities. And he's very strong in this position. Yeah. I felt. Yeah. And if he does this, there is a possibility he will win. Yeah. But I think he can do this maximum one or two rounds.
SPEAKER_00: There is one question I saw the guy is interested in. What do you think about Gennady versus
SPEAKER_01: more of a Devon match that just happened at the East versus West. What do you think generally? Next time? No. Ah, okay. If Devon, he will go very fast and don't talk with your opponent like this.
SPEAKER_00: He can win. We are talking about the match that happened already. Yeah, he made a mistake. He played so much? Yeah, he played so much that he won. If he didn't play, he would have won? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You think that next time when they pull in... We go very fast to win more fast. You think Devon will win the next one? In August? You think Devon will win? Because Gennady, he has this technique, it's very dangerous for them. Now both, they know the technique to use.
SPEAKER_00: This is very interesting. Yeah. But, but, but Ermes, do you think that, do you think that like, if you do this flow works, but if, if Devon goes like this, not hook, not out, but more like high hook like this, do you think that, yeah. Yeah. If he, he,
SPEAKER_01: He will stop his pronator of Gennady. It is hard to do this. Yeah, like this is good, but it's impossible to push. Not possible, yeah. Because if you push, he wants to do this, but he blocks like this. He can't push nothing. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think that one needs to work. 50-50 for me. Oh, 50-50. That's close, huh? Yeah. Wow. And it's very interesting to Moro with Gennady. How do you see that? Good match? Super. Incredible horsepower. I think Gennady has more endurance than Moro.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, Morozov has good endurance, but Gennady has proven more. More. More than Morozov. So we will see. We will see how it will be. But when Gennady pulled Devon, we were talking about, Gennady, what do you think about Devon's endurance and this? And Gennady always told me, you guys always talk about Devon's endurance. But he says that, when did you see me?
SPEAKER_01: like give up he said when did you see him like tired and say okay i'm tired you know he always fights with me he never yeah even when you beat him he was still fighting you know yeah yeah he's super he's a super and i think he if he have a more endurance than devon for sure he have more endurance than morris
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but do you think that Gennady really has more endurance than Devin or Gennady look like he had more endurance because Devin didn't, couldn't use his endurance. Like his endurance is built this way, not this way. Devin trains 1000 times this way, five times this way. And whenever he pulled this way, he get tired quickly because he didn't train that so much. But if Devin's elbow wasn't out, if he would pull this way, he can pull
SPEAKER_00: forever. He doesn't get tired. Yes, so his endurance, he couldn't use his endurance. He had to use something that he doesn't have endurance. Listen, you have your hook endurance is as good as your top roll? No, you can top roll one hour.
SPEAKER_00: But if you go hook, five minutes, two times you're out. This is what it is, yeah. There is a super chat. DB told, at East versus West, Matt pinged you one time, but he could not ping Evgeny. Is Matt weaker now, or would Kurnik beat that version of you that Matt pinged?
SPEAKER_00: Thank you for your super chat. He's asking, when you pulled Matt Mask in Yalova, you remember? He beat you one time, but he couldn't beat Prudnik in the Supermatch in Istanbul. So he is asking, is Matt weaker against Prudnik or Prudnik that beat Matt Mask would beat you when you were in Yalova?
SPEAKER_01: I mean, just like he's thinking. I remember, I don't know if you remember, but when he fought with me, Matt, it was more, more, more. Yes, yes, yes, yes. That match was more personal, personal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. After this,
SPEAKER_01: It was 117, 118 kilos, I remember. Yeah. And now it's 113, 114. Because if you have a lot of fat,
SPEAKER_00: If you lose 3-4 kilos, nothing. But if you don't have fat, if you lose 3 kilos, it's a lot. It's only about the kilo, but I think that Matt in Yalova, when he pulled against you, I think he was stronger. I'm telling you, that was more personal. Much more personal.
SPEAKER_00: because you said that you know he beat you because of the referee it is and then they said ah you are just a practice champion and then talk from both sides you know and then so yeah it was very personal so i think that he came here with more motivation to beat you yeah he didn't look good against rudnik i don't think he was in very good shape when he
SPEAKER_00: But it's just an opinion, no disrespect to Prudnik. But the truth is, even when I talked with Prudnik, even Prudnik wasn't in super shape at that day. I think they both didn't have their best shape, but Prudnik's shape was better. This is my opinion. And I think the style changed a lot.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I agree. Let's see how it will be. What do you think about Reva's... Are you frozen again? Okay, now it's moving. You're moving, yeah. What do you think about Reva's Latin match? Good match? Very good match.
SPEAKER_01: But I think Revas will win. Is it because of style? Yeah, you have more power when you fight. Do you think that if Revas goes for the pin, somehow Revas' wrist goes like this?
SPEAKER_00: Lalleti, he can hold him like this and the match will go like this. So if both of them lose wrist like this, who is winning there? But you remember, Rebas against Michael Tox, he was able to do this. Lalleti has more height, I think. Yeah, I don't know how they would go, but two big giants, very dangerous guys, very dangerous. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Very super fight. Yeah. Yeah. It's beautiful. You know, finally, after many years, we dream, we do it. Yeah. Many polls on social media. Oh, who would win this guy or this guy? Like years. All the time. Golden. Who, who did it? Golden. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All this time, you know, but it's all dream, you know, now we dream.
SPEAKER_01: fans dream we do it we do it again and again and again and again yeah they will now he have a lot more respect from european people now because we he want to fight with us yeah yeah yeah yeah maybe before same but with the contract you understand now yeah yeah super beautiful see now
SPEAKER_00: The things are out of control. From now, no back step. No. No back step. Everyone is gonna just do their best and we will see the result. But to me, 115 kilo, that one is right there. Yeah. Do you ever consider, ever consider like to pull for the heavyweight title or no? Probably no, right?
SPEAKER_00: My mind is only to wait to number one. Super away, super away, yeah. Yeah, I want to be number one. Because sometimes Devon goes down and then goes up again, but you don't want to lose him. Maybe in the future we will see, maybe in the future. Yeah, in the future, yeah. 115 is very difficult, I think. Yes, I understand. So, do you think that... A question for you. What do you think about Cedric Alion Garboev?
SPEAKER_01: Fantastic. The last match, for a smart top-roller like me, it was incredible to see. Super technical, super professional, elite technique. Incredible, right? When he went in the hook,
SPEAKER_00: It was like boom, boom. You do this in the practice. You do this against a weak opponent, but you do this against someone like Irakli and it's a world title match. And in a round that he took you here, you brought him here, you bring it and then you were like boom, boom, you know?
SPEAKER_00: he was like i was like yeah the new name of uh is bruce lee for sure is right here um do you realize that like he is fast he has incredible endurance
SPEAKER_00: And he has a lot of power in the hand. Yeah, and intelligence. And he can pull here. I have seen him hooking Slav, beating Slav, super heavy Slav inside. I have seen him beating Kurdesha like this. I have seen him top rolling everyone. But this guy is not only all this. This guy is doing everything with fast forwards. Like, you know, with top roll too. The guy is just boom.
SPEAKER_00: Boom, boom, boom. He's just incredible. I don't have any words. Do you think that if he makes 115 kilos, do you think he and Devon would be a good match? Super. Super good match. But I think Devon will win.
SPEAKER_01: Now, for sure, not the same when I thought we survived many times in the past. But he had a lot of problems with a wrestler with a very good hand. Like when you remember with John. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: If you take his hand, he can do nothing. And I think Devon, the set-up like this... Yeah, but he can also hit this way. I don't think he will go like this. I don't put Devon 90 per cent like this. For me, it's 55 to Devon 45. But it would be a good match, I think. It would be a good match.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I was talking with Niazi, we were thinking like, what do you think about like Ermes and not Ermes, Ungarbev and John, then like John is for sure superior because the best time of John's, he had incredible like hand control. Ungarbev is also good, but he is more likely, you know, you know, just not like that dominant like wrist, like John had it, you understand?
SPEAKER_01: He wasn't super hooker. He was not. Yeah, John was super. You remember the fight with Semerenko? When he pressed him like this and he hit Semerenko. Engarbert or John? No, John with Semerenko. Yeah, 2005. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he was like this, you know, and then he lifted and then Semarenko was like, you know. But where is Semarenko, Trubin, you know something? I have no idea. I have no idea. I don't know where Semarenko is.
SPEAKER_00: I have no idea. Trubin had a lot of injuries. I don't know what Trubin is doing. I don't think he's getting ready. I have no idea what he's doing. The first thing he needs to do is a rematch with John.
SPEAKER_01: There are a lot, a lot, many fights to do. Many, many, many. Sometimes I think you put too many matches together and after a year you don't know who
SPEAKER_01: who they made to put together. But in the times, you find something new to put with another guy. There are a lot of super fights. My friend, the things are changing. Because every result, when the results are coming, the things are changing. They look at Morozov like this,
SPEAKER_00: one and a half year ago, but now they look at Morozov up here, you understand? So like the things are changing, more of the matches are happening. Some guys are going up, some guys are going down, new guys are coming. So we need to make it run and then we will have new superstars. So, but if we don't give them chance, if we don't motivate them, then, then
SPEAKER_00: They are not going to harm us. They will just come and see, look at it and say, okay, let me do something else or let me just, I don't know, quit. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, it's an amazing moment for arm wrestling now. Super. Yes, yes, yes. The history, the total history, I think. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So, yeah, I just had a podcast with
SPEAKER_01: Tennis and Bob Kane and Artyom, Bob Kane also said the same things, you know, that he thinks that East vs West is like never happened, something like that before. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Little bit like Zloty Tur, but it's not comparable. East vs West is here, Zloty Tur is
SPEAKER_00: Are they? We all together, we all serve to Armless. I don't really compare, but I think that right now the things are very hyped, never dies. Like we just finish one event and then people are already waiting for the next event. And you are ready for student day?
SPEAKER_00: He will be upset with you. Today I trained. I wasn't going to do training, but I felt good. And then I trained. I am good.
SPEAKER_00: Easily, easily, 80%, easily, 80%, 80% easily. And, and I don't know, but I don't know. Uh, less pain, less pain, less pain. And, um, I think that when I rest more and more than he will be, um, even, um, probably less pain if I don't make any mistake, but this was probably the last, last table time I had is I did with control and.
SPEAKER_00: First time, after my bicep, I let my student, Yusuf, to hold even with two hands. I didn't top roll him, but I stay. I stay so he can put his wrist power. Because if you hold like this, if you take his wrist, it's no good training. No. If you just wait, and then he puts pressure here. If you allow him to put pressure, it's good. And then he also puts some pressure, more pressure. It's good training, you know. So I did that.
SPEAKER_00: I hold it like 15-20 seconds and then per 10 seconds it was okay and then I slowly a little bit open here. But it is good for the beginning. I will slowly try to have more this, more this, more this. You understand? I need more and maybe a little bit more bicep power. If I continue like this, then maybe... 90%. Not this event. This event, no. But maybe...
SPEAKER_00: september october maybe 90 maybe i don't know but i need to beat him first if i lose against him then then i mean there is no sense to continue not not that i i underestimate him but i don't think he is at the level of samusha or other people you know how much days if if zolev hajimrat wins amc zolev hajimrat and samusha will pull for the title 85 kilos good match
SPEAKER_00: And today, I think I'm expecting answers from Mange. Mange was so happy. Yeah, I spoke with him two hours before. Yeah, yeah. And then he was happy.
SPEAKER_01: He needs to talk with his job. He needs to talk with his job. Yeah, because he works with the state army. What is the name? Oh, he's in army? Army. I don't know what is the name. Is he soldier? Soldier, yes. Oh, Toms the soldier? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I didn't know that. Wow. Oh, he's a very good guy. Yeah, yeah. Very good. And super top-roller. Super. His coordination, everything is so good. Yeah, he wants to come maybe next month to train with me. Oh, to you? He would be good. Yeah, and if I have time, I want to come to support him in August. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Justin let me know. I will give you your ticket. I'm going to put him against Justin Hyatt. This is the guy that won the qualification. He beat Sam Harris. Sam Harris is the WAL champion. I remember Sam Harris was very strong.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and then Justin is very good hook puller. And Toms is very good. Toms is very good with the hooker. His style is very super good. But he needs to gain weight a little bit. He said that he had some problems and he lost weight, but he will gain weight. He said he will eat more. Teach him how to eat spaghetti. I ate it before. 300 grams.
SPEAKER_01: It's too much good spaghetti. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they're like very beautiful. Spaghetti with McDonald's, Jerry. No chance, it's impossible to compare this quality food.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, but it's also the matter of taste as well. Sometimes you want to eat this, sometimes you want to eat that. No, no. Spaghetti, if you eat spaghetti, it's the best choice, my friend. It may be the best choice, but sometimes you want to eat hamburger. You just want to eat, you know, just like you cannot eat the same thing all the time. I'm for the power. It's better to eat spaghetti every time. Yeah. And Jerry, he will see.
SPEAKER_00: You say Gennady, when Gennady is going, oh, Pana. And then you go like... But what is it, Pana? I don't know what is it. I have no idea. I have no idea. Yeah, but let's go a few more matches and we finish. Ermes, Dadikian. Ermes? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Me wish that he can. There is this thing. Russians are not banned, my friends. Russians are not banned. Russians are allowed to compete all the IOC federations, including WAF. But they cannot represent Russia or Russian flag. So they don't compete Europeans. And because I think the Russian Federation wants them to represent Russia. I think that is the thing, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Prudnik vs. Dadikian? 8? No, at the 9 in August. Prudnik vs. Dadikian? Dadikian is going to win, you think, against Ermes? Augustian? But not Ermes. I say Ermes. Evgeny, Evgeny. I don't understand, my friend. Okay, Prudnik is going to pull Dadikian. I'm sorry, I said wrong.
SPEAKER_01: Rudnick and Dadikian. Left-handed in August. August, yeah. I think... It's too close. If you compare the last match when I fought with Morozov, it was super amazing strong.
SPEAKER_01: little bit favorite to that I can left. I understand. I understand. But Prunik in the hook is very, very smart. He knows what he do and to hold to check. Prunik in the hook is very super. And Janis and Mindaugas, who is winning this in July?
SPEAKER_01: Mindaugas, he pulls like this a little bit. Mindaugas is, you know, pulls the strap, yeah. He pulls, but he holds. From here, he rolls you. He rolls, you know. He rolls. But from here, he also pulls the strap. I don't know. It depends if he comes back in the best shape or not, Giannis.
SPEAKER_01: If you speak for the hand control, I think Giannis has more power here. But maybe Mindaugas has more power in the back pressure. It's very close, 50-50.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I understand. And Wagner versus Peric, left arm? Wagner. Wagner? Because he's going to put pressure on Peric. Super Wagner. Terremoto. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah they they say that they say that your spaghetti is burning you need to the alarm is coming you know wherever it is yeah and what do you think about corey west versus morozov
SPEAKER_01: uh if i put the money i put for morozov but i think he will go and he underestimated corey west i will tell you something from the information i have i do not know the shape of corey but the information i have that
SPEAKER_00: Artyom is in good shape. Every time he's in good shape. If I tell you good shape, you understand. Yeah, yeah, but I think Corey West is very dangerous. Yeah, no, no, I know, I know. I don't know his shape, but I think Morozov is in very good shape. Let's see.
SPEAKER_00: I think he will win Morozov, but it's better not to underestimate Corey West. He's 200 kilos of man. I don't know if Corey's hook is better than Morozov's, but if somehow Corey puts the shoulder like he did against Ferit, then it's too much pressure that the bicep may not handle. So he's better
SPEAKER_00: up roll him good and take him here because even you top roll him here he pushed it's too dangerous that the guy yeah i saw him his mask is very super this position yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let's let's see how it will be and the jar is in good shape you have information from that i i i cannot tell you but if you are asking me this it sounds like you are not
SPEAKER_00: confident enough. I kind of feel that every day your confidence is... My confidence?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you're asking, you have information? No, no, you have information from everybody. Tell me about that. Yeah, yeah, it comes to your mind. You talk about Corey versus Artyom and then you're like, do you have information? How is Jerry's shape? My friend, don't worry, it's not important. He will lose for sure.
SPEAKER_00: I have been chatting for a long time on this YouTube podcast. This is the first time I see the fear in your eyes. Really? Yeah. Very fire? Fear, fear. Fear? What is it? Fear, like scared. No, no, no. Yeah, I see this is the first time.
SPEAKER_00: I'm very surprised. It's better you put the... Glasses. Yeah, yeah. Chance it. Okay, okay. Yeah. I can't believe that. The guy, I mean, this is the first time I see you being so scared. You look or not? Look at the quality. Quality, but they are like
SPEAKER_00: like probably looks like they are like five centimeters smaller than last time i saw yeah it's only 38 centimeters 38 centimeters is enough listen i saw how you measure you go measure here and then when you come here you go like
SPEAKER_01: Everybody do like this, my friend. Everybody. Not me. I saw how you measure. This is true. Everybody put the measurement like this. Everybody. Why? It needs to be like this. Listen, listen. Look at here. It needs to be from here to here. You guys are going like...
SPEAKER_00: down and up again. It's good that you don't make it like this from here to there. No, my friend. By the way, it's not that bad, huh? No, no. It's very big, eh? When it just warmed today... Yeah, yeah. It grew up a lot.
SPEAKER_01: It was today 42 cm, but not like yours, like this. It's like straight here, like straight. No, more down. Not like this, but like this. No, like this. Yeah. You see or not? Yeah. Yeah. Think about when I squeeze his hand like this. He doesn't give a shit. He gives his hand and he just... Sorry, his wrist like this.
SPEAKER_00: I broke his bone, his wrist. Yeah, I will tell you something. I have pulled for like more than 30 years. Of course, I never felt like Levan's hands, you understand, wrists, like we never felt. But I pulled with some... You fed my hand. You fed my hand. And you remember very well. Your wrist is very, very strong. Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, it's true. But whenever I give you 9.5 wrist, people say it needs to be 10. And then I remind you. Yeah, people are correct. No. And they say, Engin, Engin, you need to make his wrist 10. Didn't you see against Levan? I was like, yeah, I saw against Levan, that's right, 9.5. Levan, what does he have? 10.
SPEAKER_01: yes i mean you and that one with that pressure each response like this was like that what do you expect okay okay next time we change the car okay okay okay yeah i give it to level 9.5 meeting okay yeah and i know i don't don't remember top road thing got it yeah yeah yeah i mean like i i cannot imagine anything
SPEAKER_00: Better than that. Yeah. Yeah. And then I will bring it down to 9.5. Impossible to hook me. Forget this possibility. Hook the shit out of you. Impossible. We will see. Rewaz was saying the same thing.
SPEAKER_00: And my Revas now very smart technique, top row, like top row. I will tell him this. Wait. Hello, Revas? Do you know what Edmund said about you? Oh, you're watching. You're watching. Okay, you know what to do. You know, but I will tell you something. And my shoulder pressure, what do you put?
SPEAKER_00: It was three, I made it 3.5. It's very strong, my shoulder press. 9.5, what is it? It was three, now it's 3.5. But listen, yours was not like directly like Jerry's, you know. You just stop him here, stop him here. Yeah, it's better. Yours is probably, what did I say? Maybe nine, nine probably.
SPEAKER_01: Jerry is better than yourself. No, I will beat him with his technique. If I will start like this, I want to see what he does.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, you're going to do this versus this? Yes, I will start like this and him too and we will see what he wants to do. Listen, Ermes, you're going to get injured while you are trying to do fantasy, you understand? You will get injured and then he will cause you a super match and then you will ask Jerry for a rematch. Jerry, he knows he will lose. He knows already he will lose.
SPEAKER_01: in his mind. He will come and he will lose. He already knows like this. And I hope he doesn't retire this match before. Same like last time. If you start with him flop versus flop, he's going to injure you. And then you know what will happen? You will lose the match.
SPEAKER_00: And then he is already 50 years old. You will not even get a rematch with him. And then you will, the rest of your life, you will be like, oh, how did I make that mistake? Before, I want to check his power. Only check. Maybe like this, like this. Yeah, even if you check his power, listen, never start making mistakes. Very, very good check. Very good check.
SPEAKER_00: Super check. Super what? Good test. Good test, yeah. But listen, we never seen you doing shoulder pressure right away. You go up, up, up, up, and then go, and then finish. That's good, that's good. But this is a different thing, you know. To use it as a primary technique is different than, you know, transition. Yeah, no, it's different.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah but so what i'm just saying that you know like it's we cannot give the as much as credit as someone like jerry has you know from it you know yeah yeah it would be yes yeah anyway so that's what we were talking about before that you said something and then we were talking oh morozo morozo we just boom boom yeah yeah we were talking about your stats yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: Listen, I wouldn't underestimate him. Who? I think... What? I would not underestimate Morozov. Morozov is dangerous. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure he's dangerous. He's super mega strong. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. And then I versus Ray, who is winning.
SPEAKER_01: Ray, 100 per cent. Ray, you are too old. Why do you still compete? Justin to make young guys happy. Justin to make young guys happy, you know, yeah. No, I think... You're not enough. Not enough? For students.
SPEAKER_00: He will give you a good lesson. He will close your pronator. I think that even a round one, he will hold me and... Yeah. Do exercises. Exercises, yeah. This is how it will be to me. If you will come, like when I show you,
SPEAKER_01: 2021 March. We have a photo. Not like this, but a little near. I am now 20% less than that. You will do your good technique very fast. Like every time you pull like this,
SPEAKER_00: You will win very easy, I think. My friend, the shape that you saw me two years ago? Maybe, maybe, maybe he can hold a little bit like this, but I don't think. Yeah, but I'm not overpronouncing him. Yeah. Yeah. I will be attacking here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But like right away with the ready go, you know, like not like if I overpronate and then it is maybe dangerous. But if I block here and, you know, you know how it is. Yeah. And then let's see. We will see how it will be. It's very interesting. It is very beautiful to see you again to compete.
SPEAKER_00: yeah let's see i want to i want to beat him four times quick and then if i can i don't know but but plan if i win four times quick and then fifth six rounds i may try to a little bit go inside and then out in out you know but we will see yeah yeah you need to stay
SPEAKER_00: because maybe in the hooker you have pain, you told me. Yeah, but I am holding with the... Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like this is safe. To reach my bicep, you need to do something different, you know, just because we are like this, it doesn't mean that I'm holding with the bicep, but it is just all the time constant pressure to open his wrist. Yeah. Yeah, you know it, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, it's a very beautiful fight, yeah. Now, to restart, he's a very good opponent, student Ray. Yeah, yeah. The guy officially, you're right, my friend, I love to look at my arms, forearms especially. The arm is not that good, the upper arm, but the forearm, I love it. Don't you like looking at your forearm?
SPEAKER_01: What? I mean, when you are alone, you don't look at your forearm on the mirror? I think 50 times a day. Every morning I check my measurement. Every time I see the mirror,
SPEAKER_01: When you look at the mirror, do you look at your face more or your arm more? Arm? Arm, yeah. No, no, only arm. The photo, when they do a photo with me and my friend, if the arm is good enough, it's a good photo. If it's not good, it's better to do another photo. You understand? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: If I look at me with a good arm, okay, very beautiful photo. Yeah, today I had a photo of my forearm, I don't know, but... Is it from today? Today, today, after training, yeah. Ah, it's the same, I already said...
SPEAKER_00: see this photo in the past same position same position yeah this is this is how i do because i do a little bit of branch here and then the flexor muscles from under and then the the yeah it's very clean but super photo yeah yeah yeah anyways my friend hermes it's always fun
SPEAKER_01: Do you have any message for Jerry? I hope he will give me a hard time in the match. If he gives you a hard time, you're going to lose. Don't hope for wrong things. We will see. You can do this.
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah. You know how many power have inside this? Oh yeah. I heard it's like 500. It's like you remember a little bit same. Oh yeah. Jerry now maybe Jerry if we see this part of video you will retire. People here says that they want you to say poor Jerry.
SPEAKER_00: What? Poor Jerry. Yeah, yeah. People in the chat, they want you to say poor Jerry. Yeah, poor Jerry. Yeah. But I will also have a podcast with Jerry. And then we will see what he will say about you. Yeah, I already know he will start again to...
SPEAKER_01: To speak, I will win, my technique, blah, blah, blah, super mega strong. My dream will finish on the 29th of July. Finish, close. Finished? There is Paul Italia's cigar. He says, what will he do when Jerry sticks out his tongue? What? What will you do when Jerry brings his tongue out?
SPEAKER_00: what I will do. Yeah. Maybe with a seizure we cut. Yeah, but then you will receive a foul by leaving the handbag off during the match. You need to hold the bag, you know, when you're arm wrestling. Yeah. So, you know,
SPEAKER_00: No, no. Yeah, yeah, we make a foul, but I will cut. We can restart. No, no, no problem. But I will cut. Okay, I understand. I understand. We cut his power. Yeah, yeah. But will you be very, very upset when you lose against Jerry? You know, every time I say,
SPEAKER_00: Like Jerry, if you win, and then he goes, it's wrong. Don't say if you win. He says, say when you win. He tells me, you understand? Yeah. Yeah. What do you think about that? You know his finger? His finger? Yeah. After my match, his finger will be
SPEAKER_01: long more than with a will be longer five centimeters more why you will stretch you will stretch yeah yeah his arm will be longer five centimeters more you will stretch him huh yeah very good stretching for him good stretching for the foreign very good
SPEAKER_00: My friend, I have a lot of fire, ready fire. It's better to speak. I don't know. From one side, I think that Ermes is right. From other side, where are you? Frozen again. Anyways, guys, this guy is scared of Jerry. That's why when the subject comes to Jerry, he's always frozen. So I better finish this.
SPEAKER_00: I think he's not coming back. Okay, he's thinking again. Yeah, you're right. Len is right. Ermes Frost Parani. You know, guys, I need to go

It is Derek Smith and Devin and Bob Kane and Pauline. Okay. I need to answer them. I think Ermes is not going to come back. Ermes is scared of Jerry. Officially, it's proven.
