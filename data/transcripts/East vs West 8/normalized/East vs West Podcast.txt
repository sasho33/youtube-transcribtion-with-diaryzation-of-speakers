SPEAKER_01: just train this is my gym and just wanted to have a chat with you guys let me check from here my channel
SPEAKER_01: Thank you, Shannon. Thank you, my friend. Thank you, Jobs. Hello, hello, hello, hello, Jesus. Hello, Adnan, Victor. How are you guys doing? I will be ready. I will be ready. It's already getting ready.
SPEAKER_01: but you see the four are not bad huh yeah um okay guys today i'm in the gym so i don't have computer as i always said i need glasses to read all this chat um
SPEAKER_01: The bathroom? No, it's in the gym, gym. This is... What bathroom? This is arm wrestling gym. Okay, I need to turn it a little bit this way, so... I don't know why people think it's a bathroom, but... Anyways, Mustafa is my brother, my lion. How are you? I hope you're fine.
SPEAKER_01: Any plans for Croatia regarding arm wrestling soon? What do you mean, my friends? Hello to Alberta, Canada. Hello, hello, hello. Thank you, Avatar. Hello to Nevada. I have been in Nevada. I have competed Lake Tahoe events.
SPEAKER_01: a few times, I think, 97 for sure, 2003 for sure. I don't know if I went there another time, but. Okay, I have some news. That's very interesting, you know, something. Like I said, as you know, Yanis Amolins versus Mindaugas match.
SPEAKER_01: And Yanis got hurt from his elbow. And then I put the garlic and he also got injured. And then I said, Arthur Makaro and Arthur Makaro accepted. So today we bought his tickets, we bought his tickets. And then, then I realized that I promised to Ukrainian Federation that any athlete that's coming from Ukraine, I'm not saying
SPEAKER_01: they are from Ukraine, but any athlete is getting out for this event with the permission of the Ukrainian sport ministry, that they don't want to compete in the same event with the Russians. So this is how I am bringing Oleg Petrenko here. So I promised them, and then somehow, like I'm looking for opponents for Mindaugas, I said Arthur, and then
SPEAKER_01: Petrenko wrote to me, Engin, like, you remember? And I was like, oh, how did I forget that, you know? So we need to find... So three opponents, Mindaugas already eliminated, and then we need a fourth opponent for Mindaugas. And so, but I said a very good match, very good match, I said, for the East versus West, 9, August 26. I think it will be the biggest event that I ever organised.
SPEAKER_01: And in this event, if you guys remember, Tata Sinks was going to pull Zurab Taveridze. And Zurab broke his arm. And so the replacement match today, it is finalized. Both sides accepted. It will be Ibrahim Sago and Tata Sinks. So Tata Sinks is going to
SPEAKER_01: Guys, I'm sorry. I know you all want something different, but I'm going to set the matches that I think is the best. And so, Ibrahim Sago versus Tata Sings. And so this is the match I set. I also offer a match to Sarmat.
SPEAKER_01: to pull 85 kilo world title of East versus West, but Sarmat couldn't get permission. Somebody told me, I don't know if it is, I don't know what it is, but somebody said that the same case with Alan Zolaev. Alan Zolaev also cannot get out of Russia because he is in the army academy. Somebody wrote, I don't remember who, but they also said that
SPEAKER_01: The Sarmat was in the same condition. So Sarmat told me that he needs three days to answer me. Probably that's why he asked for three days. And he said that this year is not possible. And he said, hopefully next year. And probably that's why. And the truth is, I was going to say David Samusha versus Sarmat. And I was planning to pull the winner of them, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Robert Gould, thank you for your super chat, my friend. Engin, we would love to see Artem get a super match in one of your East vs. West event. He is a fan favourite and get him very strong. My friend, he won the East vs. West qualification and he's going to have his match. He's going to have his match, but not sure exactly when.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Vitaly versus Rewazin, East versus West, yeah. Yeah. It's gonna be East versus West. I'm not sure, my friend. Maybe, maybe... I don't know, maybe the world is changing. I don't know, maybe... I don't know, social media may be surpassing TV. I have no idea. Um...
SPEAKER_01: But I have also bigger plans. I'm not going to announce already. I plan to do something really big. And... Thank you, my friend. Thank you. And... Yeah, GB19. We will see. We will see. I think every event will pass the next one. John Brzing could come, but John Brzing...
SPEAKER_01: is pulling Tata Chings only two weeks after East versus West, eight, and two weeks before East versus West, nine. But there is, like, October or November, I haven't decided yet, the next East versus West, John will be right there, and then it will probably be the biggest event in the history. You know. Um...
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if internet is the way to go or something. I don't know, my friend. We are just doing our best. And just one second. Hello, Hristo. I am right now live on YouTube, but we can talk shortly so people can listen. So what do you think about the offer? You agree?
SPEAKER_01: Any opponent or especially Mindaugas? Oh Mindaugas you are ready to but he just wrote to me I will tell you exactly what he said just one second wait that's interesting that people are witnessing live you know you know that I'm setting a match one second what let's see what Mindaugas said um
SPEAKER_01: I said, you want to pull Hristo? He said, I can do that. I know Hristo is strong now, but don't be surprised if he cannot resist much. So he says that you won't be able to resist so much. What do you say about this? Very good. Very good? I have very good endurance. I have very good endurance now. Okay. I'm not so heavy. He's thinking because he sees me competing in...
SPEAKER_01: different weight classes, but actually I'm 80. I know, I know. You were not 85. You can't beat 85, but you were 80. So that's why I think that you can make the weight. But... So you're going to kick his ass? Oh, yeah. So that's what I wanted to hear. Because this guy is just so confident that he can beat you. And I think that as an old school guy, just...
SPEAKER_01: Right arm, yeah, right arm. Yeah, right arm. And maybe, maybe I ref your match. I ref your match, you know, with Minda I was. Super, yeah. Yeah, and then let's see. So we deal? We agree? Yeah, okay, okay. Now let me go back to the live, and then because people are on the live on YouTube right now, and then we can talk again for more, okay? Okay, take care, take care. Bye-bye.
SPEAKER_01: So, guys, you are now, like, witnessed live, you know. Yeah. Oh, did I show the number? Oh, I hope I didn't do it. Did I? I didn't do it. Yeah, Vitaly is putting Revas on the East versus West nine.
SPEAKER_01: If I speak Turkish and do something international, how am I going to do it in Turkish? If I speak Turkish, how am I going to introduce these matches to foreigners? How am I going to do it? For example, if you have a product and you sell it internationally, how are you going to sell it in Turkish? Speak a little more logically. There is no such thing as 10 pay-per-views.
SPEAKER_01: Merhaba, Yakup. Tabi ki yabanc覺lara sat覺yorsun. Tabi ki uluslararas覺 kullanacaks覺n. Hristo is strong enough to beat Mindaugas. I don't know that. Mindaugas is also very good. I like to tease Mindaugas. Even if I say these things, Mindaugas will never get upset because he knows that I'm just trying to tease him, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Every time I have very good relationship with these people, you know, they are like my brothers. We know each other. I have been competing for 33 years, 32 years. And these are just like family. And when I sometimes tease them on like there and there, you know, and then people goes, oh, you see that Engin hates that guy. You see that Engin is just favoring this guy. Justin guys, please get over that, you know.
SPEAKER_01: They themselves don't get upset. They know that I'm just still in the pod, you know? So just don't tire yourself, no need, you know? My bicep, my bicep is not that big, my friend. My bicep, not that big, but the forearm, as you see, kind of big. Popeye the Sailor Man. You see? And...
SPEAKER_01: are you training very hard no my friends i'm not training very hard i just came back um and i just came back and i'm starting from like middle way middle way but it doesn't mean that it will take forever to go up because i have the power but i don't want to i want to do very uh high reps right now and then
SPEAKER_01: I will lower the weight and then also lower the... I will increase the weight, but lower the reps. So that is what I want to do. Engin, David Samusha could pull, but I'm not ready right now. I want to pull at the end of this year, but I want, like, I want another match at 85 kilos and then we can see. Um...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, Hristo. Hristo is, yeah, very good. Hristo is world champion. Hristo just took third place at the European Championships, and he beat Toms Roses. And he was only 80 kilo, and he pulled 85 kilo, he took third place. He's very good. Yeah, he's very dangerous. Very unorthodox style, you know. Um...
SPEAKER_01: My chest is now 80% okay. Today I did some like those cable cross, you know, and then I didn't, of course, force it. I did like bench press up to 50 kilo I did. It was like, you know, I didn't force more than that. Yeah. Hello, Cere Antila.
SPEAKER_01: Will you put when Alan Zolov is able to against Nurdaleh Strait? Of course. I don't know who will be the champion when Alan is able to travel, but Alan is just going to go like a lightning fast for the, of course, for the world title match left and right. He should pull with left arm with the winner of Daniel and Emil and then right arm Adair Khan or if anyone
SPEAKER_01: change there in those categories, you know. The current world champion for sure. Will Hristo be reffing his own match? No, probably I will be reffing his match. And... Yeah, Hristo's style is very similar to Gamten Aze, you're right. The pack, Jay, is feeling okay, but...
SPEAKER_01: Like, I cannot really force it. I feel uncomfortable there, but it's not like a major injury. I don't think so. Viking mode. Next interview will be tomorrow, 12 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Carolina Pettersson and Elizabeth. My next opponent, I don't know. Nur Dalet is going to pull, but...
SPEAKER_01: Nurdalet is going to, yeah, yeah, after the WAF. I just talk with them all the time, and they want to... No, I didn't hurt my shoulder. I hurt only the back here. Yeah, Adnan Nurdalet and the Kazakhs, warrior guys. Yeah, and then, yeah, guys.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I am Prokopchuk. We can pull, yeah. But right now I am still 90 kilos. Prokopchuk is 77, 78. I am for sure, if God will, I'm going down to 85. But if I somehow win 85, I may even go after that to 75 as well, you know. Yes, Ongarwe, Kedirgali, hopefully will happen this year. There is no escape.
SPEAKER_01: I will put my life on the table, you know, just like you guys are going to pull. John is ready. I'm sure that, yeah, Prokopchuk was pulling 85 kilos, but he never was 85 kilos. It totally depends on the opponent. Like, I asked Prokopchuk if he would pull Talcat Akteyev 85 kilos. He said no, because Talcat Akteyev and Prokopchuk, similar level, at the same weight.
SPEAKER_01: When talkative is much heavier, then it is people's talks like, you know, weight doesn't matter or something. It's like the biggest bullshit ever, you know, like weight doesn't matter or something. I am 48 years old, my friend. I'm 48 years old. In October, I will be 49.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Tip. Hello, Engin. I'm so happy to see you and congratulations on your big win. You look great, my friend. Who would you pull next? Time will show. Most likely, when I'm ready, the current 85 kilo East versus West champion.
SPEAKER_01: Really? I emailed message Engin for VIP tickets. Are they sold out? No, they are not sold out, my friend. We have, just don't miss it, my friend. We give one deck of the cards, signed trading cards, which is $150. We give one signed poster by everyone, which is $150. And one signed t-shirt, event, which is $400 this. And then we give...
SPEAKER_01: three nights on the five-star hotel. You can come alone or with friend or wife or whatever, you know, together. And then you're going to have a dinner with the athletes. You will be part of the press conference and ask a question. You will have a photograph session with the superstars. And then you will have the VIP seat with the food and drink service during the event at the very front.
SPEAKER_01: row. And so, I mean, it's, it's, it's just, just remember we have July 29th, uh, event, and then we have August 26th event. Both are available for the, um, uh, VIP Jay clean scene and motivated and puts a smile on my face. I don't know why I feel motivated. Like I will tell you honestly, during this time after I injured my bicep and I was like, you know, organizing East versus West, I'm like dying.
SPEAKER_01: I was just like almost putting a gun to my own self, you know, threat myself to just go to gym, you know. Many times I came to gym, I look at the waist, waist look at me, you know, and then I went home and I didn't do anything. I was like, I don't want to do that. But now I'm not rusty. Now I feel like, you know, like today I trained because last training,
SPEAKER_01: My brachioradialis get a little bit sore, not injured, but sore. So today I couldn't really do so much with the pulling weight. But I did today chest, but not so heavy because of my back. And I did some finger training. And so like I can wait next two days to pass and then I come here for training again, you know. So I kind of feel it's too hard, you know, because I organize East versus West.
SPEAKER_01: July and then August is waiting, like so many things to do. And I also train a few students, you know, just, but yeah, I am motivated. Yeah. Because I see good response. You know, I feel like, you know, whenever, like at the beginning, you are so doubtful, you know, like, will I be the same again? Like, am I trying for,
SPEAKER_01: some good result or just it's, I'm just wasting my time. But whenever you see that, you know, um, that, uh, like you are like, okay, you are not at where you want to be, but you are on your way, you know? And then I'm like, okay, you know, let me, let me continue. Yeah. Yeah. Anything is possible.
SPEAKER_01: Can we see Indian Arm Master on East versus West? I mean, if there is a world-level puller, yeah, possible, you know. Anyone that is, like, winning WAF Worlds or some big event, East versus West qualification, you know. October or November, soon to be decided. There is a reason. Yeah, Jay, I think it's, as you said,
SPEAKER_01: My favorite hand exercise is, um, like parallel bar, but you put the flat wood and then you do pull up like this for right here. It looks like it's only finger, but it's also wrist because you cannot grab anything. And if your wrist is not strong, then you lose. So you train your, the beginning position of the match angle, you know? Um,
SPEAKER_01: Hajumrat is heavier than Mindaugas. Guys, I don't know. Sarmat said he cannot get permission to get out of the country. And guys, Ermes is pulling Jerry Morozov.
SPEAKER_01: some other matches while the guys are going to pull in three weeks against some opponents, you know, that are serious, you know. I mean, I don't think so, you know. Justin three weeks you have an opponent and then you are saying, let him pull this, let him pull that. How about we talk about Ermes versus Jerry, Morozov and Gennady. Like, are they not good enough? I mean, even if I said the biggest match, somebody is coming and saying, how about this match? How about the match I said, you know? Why do I say this match, you know?
SPEAKER_01: Um, who is the best of all time armors? Of course it is. It is John Bersink. Hello to Rick to Boston. Hello, my friends. Um, your ghost, how many years need one athlete to reach one? It's totally true.
SPEAKER_01: intelligence, his training methods, like how advanced it is, you know, like so many things, you know. Yeah, it is only three weeks and two days away, Jay. Yeah. Before I started organizing this event, every day we were seeing like people
SPEAKER_01: like talking about how about this guy versus this guy, this guy versus this. I think that like almost 15 years, people get so much used to only about dreaming. And then when it is like coming true, they just can't believe. I think that they just have the same habit of, you know, like not to see what's coming in three weeks, but just talking about like if a match set,
SPEAKER_01: They don't see that one. They go, let's see what I can find. Okay, this match, you know, they find a match that is not set while we already have July and August almost, I mean, two months, you know, like. A gripper can help, but it depends. If you go to my videos, you will see that, you know, there is a video how to use the grippers.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, my friend. I hope so, Jay. Yeah, I hope so. Levan's injury, I talked with Levan. He was on vacation. And I asked him, how is it? He said he feels good now, but he needs to, he's going to come back probably less than a week to back to Georgi.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not gonna mention, I don't know if you guys know or something where he has the location, but he said when he comes, he will see a doctor and then he soon will know, he soon will know where the, like when he can pull again, you know. Do I think Jerry will surprise Ermes? There is a possibility, but like, there are possibilities, nobody knows the,
SPEAKER_01: fact nobody knows we don't know their current shape we don't know how to measure from outside look yeah we we see all the possibilities which one will happen is totally depending on how they prepare how their current shape is how much they will carry themselves to the table you know
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, promo for Ermes versus Sherry will be nice. Thank you, Roman. Yeah, everything looks good. I don't have the pick for Vitaly versus Revas. I don't pick anyone in the events like I'm organizing. It is not really good, you know. I only joke about it. I tease the guys, but I really...
SPEAKER_01: In fact, don't even care who is winning, because I have enough respect. I know that each of those guys at their home, they are really doing their best, you know, to prepare, you know. I really respect all of them, and I just say that let the better one win, you know, between two athletes. Thank you, my friend, thank you.
SPEAKER_01: No, Hristo Delidzhakov is the replacement match. Mindaugas is only a 75-kilo guy, you know. People should just stop, you know, just like trying to pull people, you know, like 15-kilo, 20-kilo, lighter guys, you know, just... I'm going to find Artem, if he's going down to 85-kilo, I will find him 85-kilo opponent and then...
SPEAKER_01: If he's going up to 95 kilo, then I will find him a 95 kilo opponent because he won the qualification. I have no idea when the king of the table is going to put the official footage, you know. I have no idea. I don't know if Dadikian was allowed or not allowed, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, yeah, weight really matters so much.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, John versus Kedar Ghali. And then another match that I said is Sasho Andrei versus Tata Shinks for the 95 kilo world title. Sasho's next match will be Tata Shinks. Yeah, I would.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know when Ongarweo said, where did he say that? Can you remind me where he said this? No, you cannot wear rings in the arm wrestling hands.
SPEAKER_01: I think Todd and Sasha only pulled once at the Moldova event some years ago. Alijan is not exception about the weight, you know. Alijan is just great, but it doesn't mean the weight doesn't matter. Alijan at 105 kilo is stronger than Alijan that years ago pulled 70 kilo.
SPEAKER_01: Or Ali Can, they pull 78 kilos of Zloty. Or Ali Can, they pull 80 kilos. 105 kilos Ali Can would beat the shit out of 80 kilos Ali Can. So it just means that weight makes difference, you know. You think Rustam Babayev and returner Rubacho? We will see. Let Rustam be ready. Guys, do you know what is the bad part about, like, way too many...
SPEAKER_01: like planning is that because what you think is very exciting today after some results may not look as exciting as how you are thinking right now. So that is why we need to set a match and then maybe one more and then, then see the results and then decide what's best for the next one, you know, instead of just so much planning.
SPEAKER_01: No, that's not what John said. And everything John said on the Travis Bejan podcast is what I told to John because John didn't have, he didn't say that he contacted Ongar. I don't know if he said that. It is what I saw that John said. I contacted him to try to set the match and Ongar said he's going to focus the WAF wars. And after the WAF wars, he will, he will.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if I'm going to pull at the East versus West or different organization. We will see, my friend. The only problem is that East versus West world title is best of five. King of the table is six rounds. So if I want to have the East versus West world title of 85 kilo... No, this is just bullshit rumor. When is Tozilo pulling?
SPEAKER_01: Sarsho, East versus West 10. I'm going to pull the winner or the champion of the East versus West. Are there any good armors? In the past, there were some known ones, but I don't know. Using what to sharpen a sword? I mean, just guys, you guys need to understand that the Kazakhs, they...
SPEAKER_01: are hosting the World Championships in Kazakhstan. So they want to, they went to, they want to just like honor their country in their homeland, you know? So that's why they are so much focused, you know? Yeah. Yeah, Jaqueline, yeah, it's so much effort, but let's see, if I can make my team at the East versus West
SPEAKER_01: you know, a little bit even more, more people, you know, that maybe can take some of the work away from me, you know. See, the tournament format is not always like, like, look at the, like,
SPEAKER_01: I was gonna set Zurab versus Sasho this event, July 29th, 95 kilo world title. And then now, like, he decided to go to AMC. He broke his arm and then, yeah, it could happen anywhere, but... Um...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Anyways, guys, um, some guys are just here, just a provocation. They know the current situations, but they just come and just do that. And when I blocked them, they are like, Oh, and you blocked us, but you just come here for provocation. You know, God knows. And I know just, you know, you know, the matches I can, some of the matches I cannot say, you know, the reason, but you just come here just for provocation and
SPEAKER_01: I'm not stupid, you know. You know, you're not stupid either, so just why? Why continue, you know? Why? No, Jay, you don't need to explain. They know everything. They just want to start shit here, you know. Yes, Andrei, yeah. Todd Hutchings. Yeah, he agreed to pull Ibrahim Sago. August 26th.
SPEAKER_01: Ibrahim Sago, Tata Ching, incredible match. Morozov and Gennady live stream probably this Sunday. My forearm today, I measured cold. It was 40-something, but this, like, people measure, like,
SPEAKER_01: including Ermes, they go like this and then go down here and then go up here. I don't measure like that. I measure right here and here. Like, you know, parallel, you know, right here. 90 degree arm, not like this either. Justin I do like this. The reason I do that, because I need to show the brachioradialis as well, it's forearm muscle. And then, so it's 40 something cold.
SPEAKER_01: Two trainings earlier or two days ago, it was 142 centimeters. Why would I measure unflexed? Do you measure your bicep unflexed?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, one more time I will say I plan to pull against the champion of the East versus West at the 85 kilo when I'm ready. No, my bicep is 41 cm cold. 41.5 cm. And forearm is 40 cm cold.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think stem cells help, yeah. That's what I think, yeah. And so, guys... I'm going to put one other match. I tried to put...
SPEAKER_01: Sarmat versus David, but Sarmat cannot get out of Russia, as far as I understand. So I think I'm going to do something, you know, really tough match as well, you know. I don't know if I'm going to pull anyone before I pull the champion. We will see. Maybe we can. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: No, my bicep has been cold 43, 44, 43 for sure, 44. I have seen warm 45 cm, warm for 45 cm, so probably 43 cm. This is 41, this is not that big, you know. Thank you, Silky Wilkie, for your super chat. Engin, can you please get athlete measurements by sub-measurement program
SPEAKER_01: water and taking volume measurements i think it would be a good start thank you for your suggestion yeah 2023 looking exciting yeah and in your plane style where you feel the most pressure looks like a lot elbow involves
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, because I'm hitting all the time. I was hitting when I was younger. Yeah, my elbow, yeah. Um, Haji Murat Zolev and Alan Zolev, I don't know. If they are in both shape, Haji Murat. But I'm not sure what Haji Murat's shape right now.
SPEAKER_01: 45-something more to bicep or forearm? I wouldn't think. I would look so ugly with this weight, this forearm cold, 45-something. I don't know. I don't really care. I mean, I like big forearm, but I'm not going to dream about it. I dream only things that can actually happen, you know.
SPEAKER_01: What manager, what you guys are talking about? Thank you, Roman. Thank you, my friend. Arsene does what his manager... Arsene, I just checked him some days ago. He said, yeah, he's training a little bit, but not so much, yeah. Does weak shoulder prevent...
SPEAKER_01: side pressure. Yes, my friend, you need everything you need, everything. You need your fingers, your wrist, your, I call front wrist, people call riser, your back pressure, your pronator, your bicep, your back, your back shoulder, everything you need, everything. I mean, you don't need to train everything to beat some people, but when you go to do like really, really, really elite level,
SPEAKER_01: And then when the goal comes, when you hit each other, you will be as strong as your weakest link. So you better get ready everywhere, everywhere. And then make sure that you coordinate them very well, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Arsene Leliev, yeah, we really need the guy, but as a guest, yeah, at least, yeah, you're right, yeah. Any Canaan-experienced athlete know when the arm is about to break or when to let go? I don't know. I have been pulling so many years. I pull, even when I was like 65 kilos, I pull guys like John Burzing, Eric Walford, Rambat,
SPEAKER_01: Travis Berge and Michael Todd, many, many superheros I pulled in America. And somehow, I don't know, I never had such issue. I don't know. But I don't really... My style of pulling is like, how to say, all about the angles, you know. I don't actually pull outside of the angles so much. Thank you, Muhammad. Thank you. A chest feels better, Abdullah.
SPEAKER_01: If Ermes beats Jerry, then who can be his next opponent? If Ermes beats Jerry, if Levan is ready, most likely Levan. If Levan is not ready, most likely the winner of Morozov-Gennady match. OK, guys, let me slowly finish and...
SPEAKER_01: Morozov is not deceived, my friends. Justin choose your words, you know, carefully. Engin Terzi doesn't deceive anyone. You can ask each of those athletes. If Engin Terzi tells you a word, he does. It totally, every matchup is totally the conditions at that moment, you know. No update from Taras Ivakin.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, how can I do Andrei Pushkar card without the permission of the family? Maybe I should ask the permission of the family and just, I kind of feel like to make money through, maybe I should do something and then I need to contact the family. I cannot, you know, directly do such thing, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, pronation, cupping, yeah, but the most important is the beginning solidness of the hands. You cannot cup anything if you are not strong at the start position. You need to handle the pressure first and then cup. Otherwise, you see even those guys that have very strong cup, but at the beginning, when the mat starts back pressure, their wrists are moving like this.
SPEAKER_01: Hi, Engin, will you compete WAP Wars in Kazakhstan? No, my friend. I'm not going to. Around the same time, I'm organizing East versus West 9. And East versus West 9, next year possible, next year. Yeah, I can sell the Pushkar card separately, yeah. But I still need to contact with the family.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you, Mikhail. Is Devon Davis? Yes, East versus West, yeah. I think Taras is still in military, yeah. And, yeah. Anyways, guys, I better finish. And then I thank you guys.
