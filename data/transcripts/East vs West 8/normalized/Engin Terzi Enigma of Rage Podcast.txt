My friend, I'm organizer of East versus West. At the King of the Table, I only arm wrestle. I have no control, you know. You need to ask to King of the Table. Hello, Akram.

SPEAKER_00: your shoulders looking jack hanging. I don't know how it looks but I haven't trained yet. Yesterday I did some only 10 kilo bench press and only 5 kilo cable cross just to see how it will feel and it didn't hurt badly but with such a lightweight it was so uncomfortable I couldn't bring the even 10 kilo so much because more I
SPEAKER_00: So I was like, like this, you know, with 10 kilo, so five kilo each arm. So I think, I think it's not a tear, but something is there, but it will be okay. Yes, like, yeah, I cannot wait for that match either.
SPEAKER_00: Rajan, how would you analyze Kedirgali versus Tatasic? That match was set already, my friend, for May 6th, East versus West 7th event, and Tatasic got injured, and then I had to do replacement, and I replaced with Irakli. East versus West 10 in October or November? Maybe early November, we will see.
SPEAKER_00: Amin Kardeş. Ivan Kozlic. Best regards Engin. How is injury? Any matches for you planned in this year? Yes, end of this year, yes. But if I cannot control myself, you know, I cannot control my own self. And I may do something, you know, maybe September, around that time. Radu Lifestyle. I'm planning to come to East vs West 10 as VIP. You will enjoy for sure.
SPEAKER_00: i don't know if amc is today or tomorrow it says like first and second of july i don't know exactly which like day maybe tomorrow clerks i have no idea hello to texas michael workspace my friend marcelo talgat active i don't know what you mean by just mentioning the name when will we see devon versus hermes when both wants to pull lucas
SPEAKER_00: Today is weigh-in, okay. Now, there Eddie says, in my opinion, some people are underestimating both competitors, Jerry versus Ermes. Yeah, I mean, guys, Jerry is not someone to underestimate. Jerry is a very unique style puller. You probably, many of you doesn't like his style because he gives the wrist because, but he's dangerous. Yeah, it doesn't mean that Ermes is not gonna win. He cannot win or something.
SPEAKER_00: But it also doesn't mean that Jerry cannot win, but Jerry is not someone to be underestimated. If you make mistake, if you make mistake with your preparation, you will learn a very bitter experience. Listen, is it possible in your opinion, Devon is number two in the world after Levan? It needs to be proven.
SPEAKER_00: Sounds like a tendon inflammation. You should consider ultrasound. Yeah, maybe. Maybe I should. Ermes versus Morozov. Adam Erdogan. Kardeşim benim. Hepsine sırayla gitmemiz lazım. Sırayla. Şu an maçları var. Şimdiden ileriye dönük. Devons Forum. Hello Engin and Chad Champs. Hello Devons Forum. Was John Alexi originally set for East versus Seven? Yes, my friend. Yes. But I'm telling you, King of the Table...
SPEAKER_00: is, for me, is not an opponent for East versus West. I mentioned many times, Don Idris, the owner of the King of the Table, and myself, we are like brothers. And so, yes, originally that happened. I talked with Don Idris, and then, gladly, you know, we moved to there by the permission of both athletes.
SPEAKER_00: And by the agreement of the organisations, we talk, yes. But we also agreed with Alexey that his next match will be over here. Alessandro. Hi, Engin. What do you think about Manu Batali, winner of the left arm? Yeah, he's a very strong guy. I mean, the guy is just naturally a bull, you know, very strong guy. Hello, James.
SPEAKER_00: um Talga Daktev need to be there on table soon the guy is strong yeah his left arm is Wilson right is also good Marcelo but we need to find a right opponent for him chess goals okay whatever John Schwarz hello hello to Virginia Virginia you know I have competed at the Virginia beach uh two times world championships I competed there last time was 2000. um
SPEAKER_00: Marcelo, have a great day again. You are doing an amazing job. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We are all together amazing. Devon versus Dennis. Yeah, that's the next thing after Devon versus Gennady. Swadik Krishna. Clarks, 33. Hutchings said he is getting rematch with Sasho. Yes. Most likely,
SPEAKER_00: East versus West 10 will be very, very, very elite, but we will see. Who will beat the others, Devon or Morozov, Akram? I don't know, we need to just go one by one. Do you know what the trick thing is? If I would say Devon versus Morozov, you guys would write, how about Denis versus Alexey Voevoda?
SPEAKER_00: If I said that match as well, how about this one? How about we focus the next thing, guys? How about? We can say many matchups. We can say 300 matchups, different categories, different arms. But don't you think that it is more respectful for the athletes to what focusing on what's next? We have in less than four weeks, Jerry Cadorette versus Ermes, Morozov versus Gennady, and many other matches. How about we focus them? Because...
SPEAKER_00: If I didn't set them, probably some of you would say, like, how about Gennady versus Morozov, you know? So, just let's go one by one. And then, as you see, I'm organizing so many matches. Let's enjoy, you know? Dan Lopez, cheers to Brazil. Kleks, Engin, you said a while back that you won a trophy under a random name. What was the name? What do you mean, my friend?
SPEAKER_00: What does that mean? Thank you, Agnan. Thank you, my friends. Who do you want to pull next? Roni is asking. I want to pull the title holder in 85 kilos. I'm planning to go down to 85 kilos. I went down to 90 for the Rey match, but after the weigh-in, I'm around 92 now. But I need to go down to 85.
SPEAKER_00: So I don't know who will be holding the title. Pauline East versus West 10. We will see, my friend. Pauline will be at the East versus West 9 for sure. He will be pulling Ruslan Babayev. Guys, many of you may not know Ruslan Babayev. I said before as well. Justin go probably 2006, right there, 2006 Zlotitur. Ruslan Babayev versus John Brzenk.
SPEAKER_00: And you will see that Ruslan is no joke. John had the control, but you will also see that Ruslan is a very strong guy. Ruslan has won many Zloty, World and European titles. And he is coming for the revenge of his brother.
SPEAKER_00: People really need to focus on digest what we have first. I think the internet has conditioned some people into having very short attention spans. I don't know. It is Devon Fangirl that has the shortest. I don't know. Let's not start arguments. GB19, what do you think of King of the Table moving up to five matches now? It would be good. It would be good. It's better, you know.
SPEAKER_00: um sahib ghani i heard the jerry he has the supreme fighting skill without his wrist because he used to carry bricks in that way i have no idea he never told me that but who knows you know i should just stop putting the sport behind a paywall what do you mean why is devon dave's match not on youtube yet i don't know ask king of the table how about you support the event as well so that they cannot you know they can
SPEAKER_00: continue organising. I don't think that it is the right thing to ask if it is your very right. If they are organising a pay-per-view event, and if they are later putting this on the internet, it is because they are doing something good. But when you ask, like, where is this match? Why didn't you put this? Why? Why? I don't think it's the right way.
SPEAKER_00: Ermes will definitely win the match. The Jerry technique won't work with Ermes. Maybe I'm wrong. I have no idea, Akram. Usually Jerry's technique is working very well with the top rollers, but I don't know what Ermes is going to bring to the table. And will Artur Makaro ever compete at East vs West? Mattia, I am in touch with Artur Makaro. He said that he just started training on April and he will compete at the AMC event and
SPEAKER_00: Hello, Rino. Hello, Rino. My friend, I told already Sasha that you, I and Terence, we need to do a podcast together next week, my friend. So just don't go anywhere. Come to my podcast before anywhere else. We're going to do together for the East versus West next four weeks. I will be probably three weeks. I will be doing only the podcast of the matches, our matches, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I hope you are doing well as well. Joao Piteria, when will you fight again? End of this year, probably. I think it is stopping the sport from growing, though. No, my friend, we are the people who are growing the sport, you know? We are investing money. We are risking ourselves. We are really destroying ourselves. And then we organize it, and then you accuse us
SPEAKER_00: or stopping. Like, imagine, like, when did you see this many of the world's super, super elite matches every one and a half months, you know, all the time, you know, here and there, here and there. And then you are saying that we are stopping the growth. This is a big illusion, you know, it's not true. We, I think that, like,
SPEAKER_00: we deserve at least a little thank you know instead of saying such thing i don't know Devon says John says all kind of like incredible things you know that like like how much it is helping the growth of our Mustang and now look what you are saying um thank you Gianluca um
SPEAKER_00: Do you think people are underestimating Jerry? Yes, Paul. People are underestimating. I'm not saying Ermes cannot win. But a little bit mistake with the preparation will end up
SPEAKER_00: in a result that it won't be fixable during the match if hermes comes with a good preparation i'm not saying only strength a good strategy of course he has a chance to win but if he makes a mistake with the calculation and the plan then i'm just saying that it may not be fixable at that moment and
SPEAKER_00: You don't want to learn that lesson at the table. You want to make all the calculations correct before the match so that when you come to the table, you are not going to learn something new like Gennady learned against Jerry. Gennady was super confident. Day before the match, I said, John, do you think that Jerry has a chance? He's like, yeah. He says, especially just if Gennady tries to go outside, you will see. I said, you really believe Jerry's going to win? He said, yeah. Justin watch tomorrow, he said.
SPEAKER_00: And then next day we saw Jerry won. So I'm not saying that Jerry is going to beat Ermes. Don't get me wrong. I'm just saying that Jerry is someone to be taken seriously. When I see that people are making fun of this, Jerry doesn't deserve that. Jerry deserves utmost respect.
SPEAKER_00: this kind of people are colored you don't you may not like his style you may not like something else but just it is good that we have this kind of people that it it makes us worry about how to pull against them this is this is the beauty of armwrestling you know yeah yeah clubs i i entered a tournament with a different name yeah it was the wap wap 2002 yeah
SPEAKER_00: Engin, can we do something about having multiple rules set for the different athletes? It's bad enough the rules are already different in different organizations. My friend, in my event, the rules are always the same. We will do little adjustments for the progress, but I cannot tell another organization how to do.
SPEAKER_00: who wins beast or takashi who is the beast you mean travis bergens the age looking forward to podcast thank you very much my friend do you think jerry is being underestimate yes he is being underestimate um okay i think yes you know just keeping that mind i will inform
SPEAKER_00: Ermes just posted a video saying he beats back pressure world record at 92 kilos. Yeah. Yeah, the guy is incredible. What is your screen name? What do you mean? What's my screen name? I heard some good news. The refs at East Versus will just say go now. Not ready to go. Is that true? Yes, Devon's Forum. I want to close the hands and say don't move.
SPEAKER_00: Goal, you know, this is how I want it to be. I don't want ready goal, ready, some start with red, some start with D, some start with goal, you know, I don't want that. Engin Turba, paper, we pay for the athletes to have more matches without, we wouldn't have gotten over near as much matches. Thank you, my friend, for the support. Turba, we are living the greatest times of our lives. Thank you, Joao Piteria.
SPEAKER_00: Team Jerry Avances. And Engin, who do you think will take the tournament this time? I don't know the shape of Zaur. Has your injury healed, GB19? I think it's not torn, but I told at the beginning of the podcast that I tried to do 10 kilo empty bar, 10 kilo bench press. Whenever I bring here, it was hurting. So I couldn't bring down more than this. It was hurting.
SPEAKER_00: But normally, I don't have so much pain, but we will see, you know. Hey, Kat, nice to know Connor Ellis. Hello, my friend. I will try to get in better and better and better and better shape, and then I hope that you will enjoy when I'm at table, but we will see.
SPEAKER_00: um can you buy tickets to baseball in turkey live yes david samasha is the 85 kilo title holder right yes nick yes my friend clerks 93 and carla swedish farmer hello engine you look strong when are you going to be champion one more time go on
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, my friend. I can never say that I can become champion. I have never said during my career that I will win for sure. I just say that I do my best. The rest is my destiny, you know. We will see, you know. I can't say that. Like, I remember... I will tell you a story very quickly. We had a... I had a student, you know, and he won the European Championships over a Russian that was very dominant champion from the past. But he beat him easily.
SPEAKER_00: And his shape next same year, four months later for the World Championships was even better. His shape was better. And then we found out that his opponent, the Russian, didn't even come. So we thought that he was able to beat all the guys from second place to the last, one after another. He was just like too strong. And we were like, oh, already congratulations and this and that, we said.
SPEAKER_00: So his left arm wasn't that good. And then next day, I mean, the first day with the left arm, the match started, he was in hook. You will not believe, but his scapula was broken. Scapula was broken. I have never heard that on mic.
SPEAKER_00: entire career i have never seen anyone breaking this couple of while arm wrestling even if he would break his arm he could still compete with right arm and win but because he broke his scapula he couldn't compete with right arm he couldn't even breathe you know it was just so much pain so just never be sure anything about your life just get ready just get ready i mean and then do your best and then you get what you deserve you know
SPEAKER_00: Have you pulled Jerry on the side table or competition? You asking me? I pulled him at the top of the World Trade Center six months before he was attacked. I pulled, and day before, I broke concrete, like,
SPEAKER_00: eight hours with a huge hammer and i was like what 68 kilo or something yeah i i i i think i gave him near 20 seconds match as far as i remember jerry and jerry was the current world champion like i won 65 kilo walls like seven months or six months no even five months because it was end of march
SPEAKER_00: Five months before that, I won 65 kilos and Jerry won the heaviest. And then, yeah. Your event organizing is brilliant. As a beginner, I actually did not pay any attention to the lightweight division, but thanks to you, I found the best every category. Yeah, that's my attention, intention. I need to show you guys all the best guys.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about Emil? Haven't heard much of him. Emil is vegan green. He's a very strong guy. He gave the toughest match to Alain Zolaev in the last years. Stoner, I talked to Larry to post 6th, 7th King of the Table. Brian Lee Engin, where can I watch AMC Live? I have no idea. No, not Core Sports.
SPEAKER_00: I think you might need Russian cards, official website. I'm Italian and I will obviously cheer for Ermes, but people are underestimating Jerry too much, Mattia says. Yeah. Hello, my friend. I hope you have a beautiful and blessed weekend. You too, Chris Anderson. Connor, that's a great story. Dan Lopez, wow, amazing. I think Ermes is taking Jerry more than 100% serious.
SPEAKER_00: He just acts like, acts to be easy match for him. My friend, it may be easy match. We don't know. It may be easy match for either side. I'm not saying that. But what I'm just saying, it can be easy only if you take the opponent very seriously and do a great preparation. So, if you don't sweat during the piece, you bleed during the war. That's what it is, you know.
SPEAKER_00: so why don't core sport support east vs west tournament as the king of the table tournament sport we clearly see the huge amount of funding working on table tournament um it is the core sports is our streaming uh partner um hello hello adi benjamin that's a good cool story hanging
SPEAKER_00: Do you know me, Adih? I don't know. Windhagos compete in July 100% after... Yes, Windhagos is gonna pull Doug Ehrlich. World's strongest man. What did you miss? Ah, I didn't miss a lot, my friend. Devon's Forum today is filled with armwrestling. Um...
SPEAKER_00: Hello, can we see next Zar Pajzule with East versus where Zar Pajzule was set for the May event. He was gonna pull Ermes, but he injured his bicep.
SPEAKER_00: I have never seen Ermes this confident I hope he isn't getting carried away don't want it to end up like Kurdesha match again being overconfident no I think Ermes learned a lot you know from that experience just think of all of course sport doesn't sport events they are streaming platform both use only looks like it is more funny because they focus a few high-profile match yeah the
SPEAKER_00: okay nevermind yeah I hope Zaur doesn't injure himself again at the AMC I'm worried me too me too I hope it looks like it started too early I hope that East vs West John Brzee my friend East vs West 9 John Brzee I would love to have but
SPEAKER_00: Only four weeks later, he has a match. Only two weeks before that, he has a match with Taka Shinks. And then four weeks after that, he has a match with Alexey Voevoda.
SPEAKER_00: And then before Tata Shing's two weeks ago, we have the East versus West. Like I could set a match for John two weeks before Tata Shing's match, but it would not be nice to his next event, which will be only two weeks after the East versus West. So just like I would, I would invite John.
SPEAKER_00: Every event, every event, you know that. You know how much of a fan I am. But, like, you need to sometimes, if you love the person, you need to think the best for him, the right thing for him. And also, from an ethical point of view, I think I did the right thing. But East versus West 10, there is no escape. Um...
SPEAKER_00: Jerry versus Klee Dean was a great match, very long. I can't remember the outcome, but I think Klee won. Jerry was very, very young. Back then, how many? Half-time class. When did you first win? What was it? Ninety-four, Connor. Ninety-four. Ninety-three was my first match. I took second. Ninety-four, I won. Chris Anderson. Was Pushkar a strong arm-master or technical? He was very, very strong.
SPEAKER_00: for what he is doing, that the back pressure, that it was just really like almost tearing your thumb, you know, with that rising and then followed with the side pressure. And yeah, it was incredible.
SPEAKER_00: I want to see John to be a world champion in his 50s, Justin says. I mean, look at Devon. Devon is already almost like brand new. Imagine John being like that. Oh, yeah. Everyone is in trouble until John is 65.
SPEAKER_00: Bobby also in English, MashaAllah, you're a build like a bull. Allah razı olsun. Teşekkür ederim, Bobby. Engin, can you not delete live stream? I want to watch it later because I'm working. My friend, last time I deleted the live stream was a long time ago. Let's see.
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, just remember, tomorrow, Jerry Cadorette and Ermes Gasparini, they will be my guests at 1 p.m. American time. And it will be around 8 p.m. evening.
SPEAKER_00: In recent livestream with John Boosie, he said Devon is the favourites in match with Dennis. What are your thoughts? My friend, if I'm organising the match, I cannot really give my prediction about the matches that I'm sitting. I can say later, like, possibilities, but not now. Luca says, Jerry said only, he was only wants to clean Dean.
SPEAKER_00: This is what Lucas says. Yeah, quality podcast. Yeah, I just can't wait, you know, what they will have to say to each other. It's just Ermes and Jerry, they both really talk a lot, so we will see, you know, how it will be.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Tomorrow. I just can't wait what they will be saying to each other. Is Levan in East vs West 9? Who is the opponent? No, my friend. Levan, I just talked with him yesterday. He still needs some time to heal up. But he will come to East vs West 8 as a guest. And his trading card will be included to... Included to...
SPEAKER_00: the deck of the trading cards signed. He will come, he and Dennis will come, and they will be signing both. And there will be also all the other athletes' trading cards in it.
SPEAKER_00: Redburn, you're awesome again. Student Rey must gain a lot of experience from that match. How your pain that you felt during... My friend, it's not torn, but there is something wrong. But my feeling, maximum in a month, everything will be fine.
SPEAKER_00: maybe chest i cannot train so heavily but just just to heal up for a month but i other than that i think i can i can train other things maybe not the pressure either because it will also put pressure here so i'm not gonna put any pressure you know this way you know until i'm 100 sure that it will handle but i will i will have to
SPEAKER_00: One, two, three, four, just because, oh, I don't have pain, you know, let's pull, you know. And then that is how the injuries happen. That's why the guys never heal up, you know. Because they fall down from the 10th floor, they think that they need to jump to the 10th floor. No, if you fall down from 10th floor, you go one, two, three, four, so on, you know. We miss your pre-match thoughts about the matches.
SPEAKER_00: ah during the during the podcast that i will do with the athletes uh you will be you will be witnessing will we ever get a prime engine trading card justin is asking you will get but i'm not gonna do the rating rating and yes i need to do the that way adnan yeah yeah um
SPEAKER_00: So let's see, let's see how it will be. And I know many of you didn't agree with me about, I think the sun is coming, about Levan's endurance, but I need to tell you guys that I also disagree with the people who disagree with me. Because, because, just imagine this way.
SPEAKER_00: If just say that East versus West five, sorry, East versus West seven, like the matches were not like best of five, but just say like five rounds, full five rounds. And just say that, yes, round one, Devon won round one, it was 3-0. And then what happened the next two rounds? He lost to Gennady, right? So after round three, he lost two rounds.
SPEAKER_00: so should we just look at that match and say that oh Devon gassed out and we should give Devon's endurance seven should we do that no right so why we do the same thing to Levon when he won the first four rounds and then trust me not every round was
SPEAKER_00: domination, many rounds he stopped here and then he went there and then round three he was like if he didn't get foul he was in trouble but restart he won so he wasn't like walking in the park but he still managed to win four rounds right
SPEAKER_00: Can you tell me another combat sport, physical combat sport, that when one of the athletes secure the win, it's finished, it's technical knockouts, it's submission, and the match still continues. Do you know another sport? In boxing, you may just beat the shit out of a guy 11 rounds, but the match still continues 12 rounds because there is still possibly the other guy
SPEAKER_00: just somehow may knock him out and then win the match but after four zero after winning four rounds how the hell the other guy is gonna win so you need endurance for winning four rounds my friend four rounds
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, this is what I am saying that. But could we say the same thing if it was like not best of five, but the full five rounds and when Devon wins the three rounds and then loses the next two rounds to Gennady. And then whenever I ask Devon, you know, like,
SPEAKER_00: do you want to camera complain or something? He's like, no, I'm done, you know? So should we say that, oh, Devon has bad endurance. We see the one match, Devon has bad endurance, make him seven. No. We need to judge a person. When you talk about Levan, you're talking about someone that beat everyone else, like 6-0, you know?
SPEAKER_00: How can you say that the guy has bad endurance? And then he won 4-0 against Ermes. And trust me, it wasn't only Levan. Justin check it. If they had to come back to the table in one and a half minutes, was Ermes back to the table in one and a half minutes?
SPEAKER_00: he wasn't either you know and he didn't look either good he was just also hardly breathing there you know so i'm not saying that you know like i mean but just like just let's not go only one one match you know and then judge somebody's whole career or somebody just have a bad day he loses loses loses okay this guy is all three because last match he lost how about the matches before that who cares about that
SPEAKER_00: When you look at someone only the last match, your explosiveness, your endurance, your well-roundedness, you know, everything we need to judge by the one match. Nothing more than that.
SPEAKER_00: Ermes lost his wrist easily every round should we give him like a six or something because he was should we just ignore all the matches that his wrist dominated if you just go like last match or something come on man just a little bit like wider perspective wider perspective
SPEAKER_00: No, I mean, Atlas can still pull after 4-0. But what I'm just saying that you need only endurance to win four rounds. You don't need six rounds. But again, you know, no other sport. Justin show me. If there is a knockout, technical knockout, submission, if the match cannot be won by the other guy,
SPEAKER_00: The match never continues in another sport. If the match continues, there is still hope the other guy to win, you know? So we cannot blame Lewand's endurance when he won four rounds and then say, you have bad endurance, you know?
SPEAKER_00: My friend, I'm not going to just sit down and explain every rate that, you know, I did it, you know. I can't, you know, just like, but just know that I have been pulling for more than 30 years. I have been competing. I understand some people comes to me, they are like, oh, you know, no shit about arm wrestling. And then I'm like, you know, just, and then whenever I react back, you are like, oh, you are not nice. Okay, this guy is very nice. And if I say something bad, I'm not nice.
SPEAKER_00: And if I say, hey, you saying these things, well, I don't know who you are. What have you done in arm wrestling as a trainer, as an athlete, as an organizer? What have you done? What do you know about arm wrestling? Like, if you ask me, okay, John many times told me that I'm the most knowledgeable. Devon many times told me the same thing. Cobra called me walking on . And then if I remind this to other guy, oh, Engin, you are not humble. I mean, what am I gonna do? So, Engin, you need to take all the shit
SPEAKER_00: And you cannot say anything. The guy will be the knowledgeable one. And you will be the one who knows nothing except this. Okay? And then shut up. Why? Because like, because maybe the guy doesn't buy paper. But come on.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, critics is okay. Somebody just goes, in my opinion, Levan has seven Andrei. It's okay. I don't get involved there. But when the guy comes like, you know, you know nothing. My friend, I didn't only win so many world titles. I have actually trained more than 10 WAF senior world champions, you know. I made them champion also.
SPEAKER_00: And then you tell me your question, and, like, you make him fun. You say something, and then you put a laugh in at the end of it, and you think, you know, you are respectful, you know? Online arm-wrestling school paper. My friend, you know, I really don't have any time. I really don't have any...
SPEAKER_00: You know, I barely, barely found time to compete at the King of the Table. Before that, I went to Moldova for the European. I'm the technical director of the Turkish national team. Like, you know, trainer is the highest point, the only one in my country. And I spent there 10 days. We won the whole team trophy, number one.
SPEAKER_00: and i spent there 10 days i came here only one day 19th i stay and 20 again i went king of the table competed there come back here now i'm focused on the july event that's finishing and then august event you know just like i really don't have time you know i really don't have any time you know um
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, guys, anyways, just remember, very soon we will have, oh, okay, another thing, most likely,
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Ermes tomorrow will be guest together with Jerry at the same time. And then I will start costing all the other athletes that they will be pulling at the East versus West eight. I think most likely we're gonna do the championships belt or the East versus West eight and
SPEAKER_00: to the future you know and very soon we will have the design and we will have the uh the belt and i think yeah it would be good you know some people just organize something i'm not talking about king of the table but some people says like world title you know like come on man like
SPEAKER_00: You are not even, like, probably number 15 in the world just because you call it world. Like, just imagine, Adair Khan, our world titles. Like, Adair Khan is the current world champion who beat, who won the world over Mindaugas, Yiannis, Daniel Prokopchuk.
SPEAKER_00: and then 85 kilos Samusha, many times European World Zloty Champion, 95 kilos Sasho, 105 kilos Ongarbeev, 115 kilos Devon, and now Jerry and Ermes, and soon, as soon as Levan can pull, he will pull for the title. And left arm Morozov, Ali Canmurado, you know, now Daniel Prokopchuk is pulling. You know, so, I mean, come on, you be careful when you are calling something a world title, you know, just...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah, just... Arif versus Dave is good, yeah, clerks. But just remember, we need to give Dave Chappie time. This guy needs really...
SPEAKER_00: He really needs to focus on his health, his neck, everything. Whenever he says, OK, I'm ready, I think that is the best thing if you want to have a day, a long time in our sport. East versus West World Champion, yes, but just remember,
SPEAKER_00: I wouldn't call it a world title if I wasn't invited. Like, who did Ongar Bale beat to become world champion and continue? John Brzenk. Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_00: Like, just remember that, you know, just like, I can invite, like, you know, these regular guys and say, oh, this one is the world title, you know. Like, if you call him world title, make sure that you have the best guys, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, Levan, Levan is going to pull too. If Levan wasn't injured, he was pulling, you know. So very soon, very soon, everyone just be patient. I will be inviting all the... No, we already have the world title. We give the, we give the already, but I'm going to give the... I'm going to give the...
SPEAKER_00: No, I'm not talking about amateur world championships. WAF is really, really, really, really the world championships. It's the toughest event in the world. From 55 kilos to 90 kilos, I mean, they are incredible, you know. Yeah, yeah. Prudnik is going to pull left arm with Dadikyan. He's going to... His right arm is not ready. His right arm is not ready.
SPEAKER_00: Vitaly versus Morozov will determine number one left. But he needs to pull. He just started, he pulled Tobias, and then now probably the next one will be Morozov versus Vitaly.
SPEAKER_00: I think that, my friend, I think that, yeah, Michael Post said that, yeah, thanks to him, yeah. I think that...
SPEAKER_00: tournament type of like if you go to amateur boxing amateur boxing you see there's a tournament you have like like first round this semi-final quarter-final semi-final and final but when it goes to the pro pro world title you don't see tournament because draw plays huge factor
SPEAKER_00: so you may have someone and you like two minute matches while the other guy who you are gonna pull on the second round maybe had a dominant win you know boom boom boom so you pull two minutes this guy had a dominant win and then you meet him and i don't think this is the healthy way to determine the best guy you know so that's why super match and the title matches i think it's the the best best way to do it
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Dadikyan is pulling right arm against Irakli Zirakashvili in the same event.
SPEAKER_00: My friend Michael works with, I really have to do a lot of things. Tournament, yes, that is a good idea, tournament. I want to do an event in U.S. Like I want to do more qualifications, maybe from Asia, Africa, you know, Middle East, you know, just to make arm wrestling more popular everywhere. But just I realized that, like, I think my days needs to be like maybe minimum 36 hours a day or something, then maybe it's possible.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, King of the Table and East versus West, yeah. Are you planning to compete left? Yes, I'm slowly training. Since 2019, I didn't compete. Engin, you see the new world record back pressure by Ermes? No, I didn't see, but Ermes told me already that he was going to post. Yeah. If you could replicate the Moldova tournament from 2018 with all the super heavyweights, that would be epic. Yeah, I think I can make like...
SPEAKER_00: Like, 16 guys, Invitational, but just again, you know, the draw will play a role, you know. Why did Dadikyan decide to cut weight? Again, it seems... Yeah, but Dadikyan is, like, if he didn't, like, it's 105 kilos. I mean, if you want to pull someone, you know, sometimes you cut weight, you know. Sahin Engin, sir, what do you think about Ermes versus Morozov next month? What do you think? We will see, my friend. We will see.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, Sanka. Thank you, my friends. Will Ermes broke Jerry, my friends? Time will show. Engin, what is the lightest category weight at the East versus West? 75 kilo, Michael Workspace. 75 kilo. Where did the name East versus West come to your mind? I have no idea how they come, but, you know, like inviting people from East and West, you know, to meet each other, I think it was fun, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Which country is the best? There are many countries. There are some clubs in Russia, Bulgaria, Latvia, myself, Kazakhstan, you know, just like many countries. There are many places.
SPEAKER_00: no no no Devon Devon Devon Devon will be doing everything people criticize Devon that he's not pulling enough Devon I think soon will show that you know he will be even pulling more than anyone else yeah guys signed trading cards are ready and
SPEAKER_00: About half of them, probably more than half of them are already sold, even though we are like four weeks away. And t-shirt and poster soon will be ready and then we will have two more surprises.
SPEAKER_00: You need Enigma Rage card. I think we can do Enigma Rage card at the point prime, but I need to someone like Devon, Emil, these guys need to make the rating. I cannot do to my own self. People who knows me from my prime, they can do it here. No, no, no, there is nothing all 10s or something. There are some maybe, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: for my weight category, but... No, no, no, no. All 10 is just... It's extreme, you know. But just, I will tell you something. I have won world title in hook, side pressure, top roll, even with the deadrest. I have done all... If my... If my elbows become as good as Devon's today, that stem cells help, then I may be...
SPEAKER_00: Again, surprised some people. Um... No, not all on. I mean, but trust me, my... Even hook was very, very strong, you know. I wasn't... I didn't prepare to go there, but especially left arm, it was very, very strong, yeah. Anyway, so... OK, let us finish.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you. Thank you very much. If you don't have more questions, and then we can meet tomorrow. Justin don't forget 1pm Eastern Standard Time. Jerry Cadorette and Ermes Gasparini. I really cannot wait. Like it will be very, very hard to stop these guys.
SPEAKER_00: Michael Workspace, I really hope that we get those sponsors so that send Ahmet Burak Atınç, kardeşim, tekrar başın sağ olsun, Allah rahmet eylesin. Jacobin, thanks Engin, you're the man, you're the man as well, Jacobin. Thank you, Benjamin, thank you. Clark, see you, see you tomorrow, my friend, see you tomorrow, and yeah. Sanka, see you tomorrow, see you tomorrow, Engin Turgut,
SPEAKER_00: See you tomorrow. World's strongest man. Yep. See you tomorrow, my friend. Oh, you all take care. Okay, let me do some forearm. One week no training. It's getting smaller, I think, a little bit. But...
SPEAKER_00: Have you ever lost to someone you felt comfort in grip? I don't remember, my friend. I have pulled, like, thousands of matches, probably. I don't really remember what I did, everything. I even sometimes forget what I ate this morning, you know, at the breakfast. So, hard to remember. You know, the hard desk, more you record from other side, it deletes or erases. I don't know how you call it. Yeah. So, take care, guys.
