And I was still looking around, you know, what to do more, but I'm like, okay, don't be doing more than necessary.

Hello, Rino.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, Ermes is a big guy, 125 kilogram. What is your plan with stem cells? Are you doing anything you think you need them? No, I think I need them. After I see how Devon is just doing all the dead wrist,
SPEAKER_01: like hook, side pressure, everything. I'm like, when I was watching in Dubai, I was like, will I be that healthy as well? I was like, I hope, I hope, like I have so much knowledge, so much experience, but I just cannot apply because of the, if my body,
SPEAKER_01: like somehow gets the same positive effect on the stem cells stem cell and i think that like i can do some serious things are you using tr3 stem cell in your training no my friend i'm not using anything stem cell i'm planning to go to overseas and have some bob bob moon
SPEAKER_01: Richard the annex, what do you think should be the strongest parts, your riser or put, they both need it. We cannot be like strongest parts or something. They all are, but I will tell you very shortly, if you want to be successful armwrestling, you need to have a great coordination between your necessary muscle groups.
SPEAKER_01: How does a week of training look for you? My friends, I can just train whenever I can. It totally depends. I feel and do it. If arm is ready, I train. If not, I wait another day. But I try to train different muscle groups. Today, mostly it was brachioradialis and wrist I did.
SPEAKER_01: No, Mohamed, Ray told me that he was destroyed. His arms, like right arm, he said, today I talked with him, he said that every round, get in top role, get in top role, he said that his right arm was not healed up from the arm match. Maybe he leveled up, but he didn't, I don't think he was at his best.
SPEAKER_01: if you can yeah somebody came but paulo came mike i think he can show us your medals and gym my medals some of them are there and hello paulo you look big you look big i am big yeah you look you look strong yeah
SPEAKER_01: John is getting better. Guys, I will be more focusing now to the guests. Thank you, Yone. Thank you. And after that, you know,
SPEAKER_01: So whenever I do the alone, when I do alone podcasts like chats, I try to read every question, but when the guests come, I will try to focus on the guests. And today, Pavlo is not the translator guest, but he's an East versus West puller for the next event. He's going to pull Sandris's status. And as far as I see, he looks good, looks strong.
SPEAKER_01: engen you should invite me as a translator too i love it you should invite me as a translator too i love to be a translator i know that's why i tried to make it together with the petrenko at the same time you know originally you're from there and yeah um um what do you think what do you think the guy
SPEAKER_03: just pulled a lot in Canada. Now he pulled two weeks before he went to Arizona. And how do you see your opponent? I don't underestimate Sanchez. He's one of the best opponents I ever had. But I think at his age, he can do that. I used to pull every two weeks or even sometimes every week.
SPEAKER_03: every two weeks I mean it was okay until my 30 couple years 35 probably I did not feel much affected by that uh after that uh yeah I'm not cool I'm not doing that anymore I can pull uh small tournaments every two weeks no problem but uh if it's something serious not the serious
SPEAKER_01: matches, the earliest should be once a month. Yes. I also remember when I was in the US, I was just like 65 kilo was pulling up the eight categories. Of course, depends on the level of the event, if it's a state event. I remember even pulling two events in two days, like today and tomorrow, and then pulling multiple categories at the time. Yes, today, I don't think I can recover. But again, you know, it depends on the level of the event.
SPEAKER_03: yeah absolutely uh it's it's complicated because recently i did this i don't know why did i did that but i promised that if my arm would be the same one piece i would come to arnold's classic so i pull uh king of the table
SPEAKER_03: on saturday right and uh next friday i pulled the arnold classic so it's not even a week apart and it was it was not okay on my body after those two events i was two weeks i was out of business completely i was out i still managed to win it somehow i think it's a little bit of luck more than my power but uh i i prefer not to do that
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think we should give every event 100%. I mean, it depends on the level. It's not like super, super high level event. If you think that you can win it when you are like 85%, 90%, then I understand. But if you are like pulling someone at the world level, of course, you need to be 100%. This is what I believe in. Yeah, absolutely agree.
SPEAKER_03: so how about you how is your shape compared to before i think i'm at 100 now i i'm a little surprised by what's going on in my life but i took it very seriously prep and uh i think i'm at about 100 right now so you are you will come to istanbul at your best yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's good. That's good. North American pullers need those wins. Yeah, I tried to inspire inspire, you know, people back there in
SPEAKER_03: yeah i i wish i'm at 105 i may be because i'm finished with my heavy trainings and i will do a little tempering uh for a couple days and i will take the full rest and by the time i'm rested i may be a little over 100 percent i may be at best shape ever best ever yeah yeah this is what i was thinking yeah i'm very happy to hear that i'm very happy um that you are gonna bring uh
SPEAKER_01: your best, yeah, that will be good because your opponent is one of the best in the world in that category. And it will be great. It will be great. How do you see your chances? You know, I couldn't invite Sandris. Sandris is in US, I think, as far as I know. And he won't be available today. So there will be you, Oleg Petrenko, and Chen Zhou.
SPEAKER_03: yeah it's uh it's it's always a good chance uh i think uh it's going to be an interesting match me and sundries uh this was in the air for uh quite a bit as of right now and uh i like that we were meeting at the big stage at your stage so um
SPEAKER_01: yeah i think uh i think my chances are pretty good i would say uh about 60 to 40. for your favorite yes for my favorite that's good that's good that you are confident yeah he says that he would he would watch this podcast
SPEAKER_01: know it says and yeah it says that you rock and yeah it's good it's very good i i kind of believe that like the results are important but i'm saying generally for the north america i think that these events that's for all happening very often i think it is going to level up
SPEAKER_01: North American arm wrestling, which is because of the high level of competition. That's my main intention. I remember I was having a podcast. I was a guest for Emil, and I was saying that this world being divided is no good. We should be pulling all together.
SPEAKER_01: and i kind of didn't like and now everyone is together and and i love it here i love what's happening and you did it seriously it's it's already changing here uh when you've been hello hello hello oleg hello my hello hello hello hello my friend yeah paulo we did it all together my friend all together
SPEAKER_01: because we all all believe in this and now like we did it together just like i i'm happy for arm wrestling and for arm wrestling fans and for the arm wrestlers you know i'm just so happy it doesn't really matter uh who is organizing this and this this is what what we deserve we we are all sick of like
SPEAKER_01: treated like are messing, like not real, you know, or something. We're gonna show them how beautiful sport we have, we're gonna show the whole world.
SPEAKER_03: I will disagree with you on this one a little bit. It matters for organizer because when it's you, it makes it a little bit different than when it's completely commercial point of it is the most important. And then everything else, it makes a difference. Engin, I know what I'm talking about. And thank you very much for doing this. I understand, Pavlo. But what I'm just saying that we need to focus on the targets
SPEAKER_01: I understand and I appreciate the way you are thinking, but we should just only until until we get where we deserve to be, we should just only focus the target. But it's, of course, good to hear. But, you know, I will I will never be like this. You understand? It's just like I'm just I feel like a responsibility, not like nobody is giving favor to anyone. You know, if you come into this process, you deserve it.
SPEAKER_01: if i mean i'm organizing all these things because the community deserves even better than that so anyway so um so oleg uh how is your shape my friends uh
SPEAKER_03: I'm in good shape. I gained 7 kilos. I added weights. Now I have a weight of 107-108 kilos in the morning. I'm in better shape. As always, with each Istvest I gain better shape. Because I had a break in 2019. COVID, then the war, and I didn't fight. I lost my shape a little. Not even physically, but more
SPEAKER_03: And now I see that I'm slowly coming back, and I've added strength, and I'm technically trying to pull up where I see what they're telling me. So I'm well prepared.
SPEAKER_03: yeah alex saying he's uh constantly gaining the form and again he's in his best shape ever uh about 107 108 kilos in the morning and uh oh it's good that's the heaviest i have i have heard of yeah
SPEAKER_03: And he said that, yeah, between 2019 and first East versus West, he maybe lost a little bit of the form because of the COVID, because of the war in Ukraine. And maybe not as much on the power side, but of the feeling of the table, you know. But now, after he come back to the East versus West, he's gaining every time. And every time he's coming better and better. And he's very much ready right now.
SPEAKER_03: And what does he think about his winning chance? Like, is he feeling stronger than the time he pulled against John? Yes, I added strength and technique.
SPEAKER_03: I think I have a lot of chances. Maybe I overestimate everything, but I think that 80% will be my victory. Although Chance is also a very good athlete. I am currently watching a lot of his videos. I see how he fought with John, with Todd Hutchinson, at the East Fest, I see his fight. Also, like all athletes, he has weak sides. I think we will use them. My form, I say, this time is better.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that, yeah, maybe I'm overestimating myself a little bit, but I think my chances are around 80%. What percent? 80. 80. Oh. 80. And he says, listen, I'm watching the videos with chance and I'm not underestimating him. And I...
SPEAKER_03: i saw his uh super matches with john with todd hutchins and others and watching his uh east versus west super matches so he's getting ready and he said listen i'm in a better uh physical strength and technical form than i was with john so i'm ready okay okay and chance how are you my friend i'm good and how are you i'm sorry
SPEAKER_01: i'm just kidding do you need me to translate this yeah yeah translate engen for me please ah so that that that was rude so you know i'm just i'm just kidding my english okay yeah hello hello okay i'm gonna block block you one second
SPEAKER_03: uh yeah i will i will uh okay okay i will translate back to uh just the basics you know just short translations okay
SPEAKER_01: okay okay you you say that after i i say you're gonna translate for him as well this is what you're saying yes yes i will say both of you to oleg so to keep him in conversation maybe not yeah yeah yeah yeah you know okay chance this guy from ukraine a strong guy and he said that he's about 100 708 kilo right now and he thinks his chance is 80 percent
SPEAKER_01: i heard it okay you were here when he said yeah yeah sorry and so do you what do you think about that like are you are you going to are you going to disappoint him yeah yeah unfortunately for him his chances are much lower than 80 percent maybe eight percent would be a little bit more accurate okay paulo go ahead and then i will continue
SPEAKER_03: Oleg says, listen, I'm also ready. And I'm a little upset because I think it might not be 80, but it might be 80. Okay. I'm glad he's getting ready for me. He's saying, yeah, I'm very happy that he is getting ready for me.
SPEAKER_01: He's getting crazy already, already, already. OK, sorry, sorry. Yeah. And yeah, OK. This is interesting. You know, they both are thinking that one says that he has 92 percent chance and the other one says he has 80 percent chance. And yeah, chance.
SPEAKER_01: like what makes you think that you are so heavily favored in this uh you think that because his hand hand wrist will not handle your pressure to the back yeah i i was joking a little bit of course i i don't think that i have 92 percent uh
SPEAKER_00: 92% chance to win, I think. Yeah, you just have to answer that way because he said 80%, right? Exactly, of course. But, I mean, I do think that Oleg is a very dangerous opponent. I think that he does have some potentially difficult lanes for me to handle, but...
SPEAKER_00: stylistically i i think that this match really favors me i think that traditionally the way that oleg arm wrestles um i'm really comfortable with so um i just believe that i'm gonna be able to keep him from from his strength and and access mine and and i i i truly do believe that that this matches is uh is gonna go my way your way right but it's not really mismatch or something right
SPEAKER_01: Maybe a little bit of a mismatch. I think it might be a little easy for me, but not too easy. Yeah, yeah. I just get everything I need to provoke all that. Did you hear that?
SPEAKER_03: Pavlo, can you please translate? He said that he is right about 92%. He says that the opponent is dangerous and of course I underestimate him. He says that in terms of fighting style, he still believes that he will win and that he will be able to keep you in a position far from your strong sides.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying, yeah, I want to see that, but I think he's overestimating himself a little bit.
SPEAKER_01: oh okay okay i understand um you know we we know a chance that someone that all the time
SPEAKER_01: smiling you know showing those beautiful tooth you know and yeah yeah and then i remember one time i made a post do you remember your your same photo yeah for four of them you know and then i said change show while he's angry you know and afraid and happy or something all the same you know yeah
SPEAKER_01: And now you are laughing, and Petrenko, every time he hears Pavlo's translation, he also laughs. I'm just curious who will be laughing at the end of the match. Both. Both will be laughing? Yeah, I think they will laugh. Oh, really? Okay. I don't think that, you know, training that much, coming there and losing and then laughing. Maybe an hour later, but not right away, probably. Yeah, that's for sure.
SPEAKER_01: yeah and chance um you like to go outside and you are how to say very dangerous against the hook pullers i don't remember when last time you were hooked um like i mean tatachins got couple john try to he got left
SPEAKER_01: And I really couldn't, he was going this way, but like, even when you lose, you're losing usually from here, you know? So Oleg, I don't know, like from outside, it's very hard to hook you. And Oleg is very strong, but his hooking ability, I cannot say the best in the world.
SPEAKER_01: so but he also can be very strong here so my question to you when you go outside if you cannot control his tornado but if you stay if you both stay like flat wrists um do you think that your chance is higher with your side pressure or like when you said that it may be mismatched is it was it because of like you thinking that you're gonna control his tornado
SPEAKER_00: I don't think that I have to control his pronator to win. I think that I just need to keep my wrist from going back or stay out of his hook. Like when I pulled Arabuli, he at first is trying to top roll me and I'm able to contain, stay flat and drive sideways. Of course, he won, but that's after he was able to access. First, he stopped you with his pronator. Justin he blocked your hand and wrist and then he went there. If you went directly there, he would flash you.
SPEAKER_00: right right um i i just uh i again i think petrenko is a very strong opponent i just don't think that if he's able to to block me just the same as uh david is i i just don't believe that he has the same pressure in a press uh-huh okay okay i understand i understand um let me just say yeah yeah please yeah
SPEAKER_03: Engin asked him, what is the plan of the fight? What do you think can happen? Why do you think you are stronger? He said, Oleg is a very serious opponent and I have a plan. Almost no one manages to get me in the hooks. If we even stop in the middle of the table,
SPEAKER_03: I'm sure I'll be able to pull him out of the center a little bit. And then you see the details that show that he will be able to make a strong press. I would like to say that this bone is far from being the same as it was with John. Justin a little clarification that he changed the plan.
SPEAKER_03: uh okay uh yeah alex says that uh it's about time to change the plan because this wrist is a little bit different from what it was with uh john thank you okay so is he saying he's gonna hook me then uh
SPEAKER_03: Aha, Oleg says, yes, yes, possibly, but this is plan B. Oh, okay, plan B. He says that maybe Chance will want to hook me after he fills whatever I have as a plan A. Okay, so Oleg is thinking that Chance will be the one that who will need plan B.
SPEAKER_01: Yes. Okay. Okay. Justin can you tell him that, you know, I'm like, I think that it is good idea that his hook option is plan B because no, no, no. His hook option should be plan A. Tell him to try that first, please. I think he understands. Triple says, Pavlo, you look more like ripped.
SPEAKER_01: It looks like you change your training program or what? Yes, and what was your weight right now? So i'm sorry I have all 4 kids with me today.
SPEAKER_03: uh my weight uh this morning i was 118 kilos 18 yes oh you are so big you know that the max is 115 right for your match yes i did it on purpose i changed my training yes i changed yes uh i changed basically everything i did so you need you need to lose three kilos you know right thank you yes
SPEAKER_03: oh okay okay yeah okay so i just don't want any misunderstanding yeah i did it on purpose and i feel and i think everybody feels a little bit better when we're losing a little bit weight before the um tournament i'm not talking about 20 pounds or like 10 kilos but i'm talking about a few six five six seven pounds or three kilos a little uh a little bit of that crap
SPEAKER_01: process so yeah i kind of do the purpose so you are saying that after friday weighing you will you will gain that weight back and you will probably be pulling near 260 265 265 oh oh somebody is in trouble sundays are you watching this you may be in trouble you pull in two weight classes two weeks before east versus west i think somebody will
SPEAKER_01: probably show you that you shouldn't underestimate him. I'm not saying he's gonna win, you're gonna win or something, but I think that Pavlo is coming with a top level plan. This is what I see. Pavlo wants to come here as soon as possible again. This is what I feel. I do. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: anyway so um chance you pull have you ever pulled against paulo no never and but you are from same country and you have been like you know a lot about paulo you are not only an arm wrestler you're also a big time arm wrestling fan you know some some some arm wrestlers are just like they just arm wrestlers been asked this uh i don't know you know you are not like that yeah
SPEAKER_01: And so what do you think about that match? You pull against Andrei, but not against Pavlo. Do you feel like Pavlo looks a little bit more dangerous than usually we know?
SPEAKER_00: know him yes yes I do um you know I think if if you ask me this about Pavlo versus Andrei like one month ago I would say maybe Sandris 60 40 but now I think it's the opposite really uh and I'm not just saying that because Pavlo's on here I I talked to Pavlo a bit about a game plan and things like that but I I really think that Pavlo's chances to win is 60 at least so you are saying that as of now Sandris's is underdog yes yeah okay
SPEAKER_01: And can you ask the same thing to Oleg? What does he think? Does he think that you look a little bit bigger than usual? And what does he think about, like, his opinion about the match, you versus Sandris? Oleg, Engin asks about me. He asks, do you think that I look a little bit bigger than usual? And he asks, what do you think, what chances do you have against Sandris?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, it seems to me that you have gained weight, right? Yes, you have become bigger, your arms have become more massive. Recently there was a vote on Facebook, I voted 50-50, because I saw that you fought very hard in your fights, you had good results, and Sandris is also strong.
SPEAKER_03: I have not fought with anyone, neither with you nor with him, so I can't say that I will give someone a victory. I think 50-50. It probably depends more on how comfortable it will be for someone. Whether the fight will be uncomfortable for someone, I think it will be a victory. Well, that's my opinion.
SPEAKER_03: uh yeah oleg saying that yeah you looks bigger your arms look massive and uh he said the the uh not too long ago on facebook there was a poll uh and he voted for 50 50 because he saw my uh matches and super matches and sundries but he never pulled me either me or him so he said i'm not sure it's going to be very interesting match because power wise your guys close
SPEAKER_03: but it's most likely gonna went the direction of who is more comfortable in the setup and the match
SPEAKER_01: i i kind of see sandra says someone don't get me wrong more technical yeah and more experienced while i see you the stronger one i think as as of now you are stronger than him and you know to be able to apply saying you i mean to be applied to be able to apply your techniques
SPEAKER_01: you really need to have strength as well so we will see how much his technique and well rounds will play role because i mean i don't know sometimes it may not matter we will see how it there is a super chat sean richardson thank you for your super chat proud armors member here i watch every pay-per-view that comes out i love our missing and i love you guys
SPEAKER_01: All of you have inspired me to work out hard and get stronger. Thank you all so much. Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you very much, my friend. We wish you the best. Yeah, that's interesting. Somebody said that this is light heavyweight versus super heavyweight. But as of now, Petrenko's weight is in the heavyweight division, not light heavyweight. The weight that he said, 108 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: So let's see how it will be. I'm very interested. And what do you think about their match, Pavlo? We talked about your match and we asked them, so what do you think about their match?
SPEAKER_03: It's going to be an interesting match. Yeah, the style will make a difference. I believe that Oleg is more powerful than Chance, both young. So Petrenko is not fast. Chance, a little faster, can gain a position.
SPEAKER_03: they're they're close it's definitely not a mismatch definitely not I I want to see it but I believe uh I believe that it's very very close about 50 50. if chance will gain his position of the start if all it is still
SPEAKER_03: on the slower side and doesn't have that uh stop trained yet then uh chance have a better chances but if patronica worked on that start and they will be equal speed then i think oleg may uh close it towards him and there was a straight hand you know side
SPEAKER_01: that's a possibility so yeah so you are saying that oleg has so much horsepower yeah and it is totally up to if you can apply this or not yeah yeah it's it's yeah that's the question
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah we will see um chance also is in good shape as far as the information that is given to me and we will see we will see like i love that i love that like two people they are training they have hopes they get ready they analyze each other and then they just go their pool and then whatever the results they shake hands and they go home train harder come next time yeah it's beautiful yeah and so
SPEAKER_03: Let's see. And you said, what did you say, Pavlo? You said that your chance is higher than Sandris's. This is how you feel, right? I feel it like 60-40. Like the famous chance was thinking, yeah. Yeah, on my side. Because I think you're right that Sandris's is a little more technical than I am, but I believe that I'm stronger right now.
SPEAKER_03: and last time i talked to devon uh i asked him a straightforward question what would you take technical abilities or power and he did not think a second he said power
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think you are also stronger than the last time when you trained with Devon beginning of the June, right? Yeah, because it has been almost one and a half months and I'm sure that like you picked after that time. Yeah, this is what I was thinking, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: let's see probably what 10 days 10 days later we will see each other yeah it will be you and i we never met right probably in person in personal no yeah yeah it would be great to meet you my friend it would be great to meet you thank you yeah and so let's talk a little bit about the other matches as well
SPEAKER_01: and do you guys know the news about mike ayala i heard but i don't know what's happened i know all the details it's not my place people ask me you know like oh tell us tell us tell us i mean it is not there are there are some uh problems
SPEAKER_01: and so but again you know it is not my place but he cannot basically he cannot come to uh east versus west so i replaced him with um do you know uh do you know uh andre kipriano
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the guy is just a former European championship champion. And then he took third place at the last Europeans after the Georgi guy and Krasimir. And in fact, he beat the Georgi guy one time. They fouled the Georgi guy. Second start, the Georgi guy beat him. So Andrei is a very fast guy.
SPEAKER_01: and Lachlan has big horsepower. I'm sure Andrei will be faster, but being fast is enough or not, only the time will show. So do you guys have any opinion about this, any of you?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think that Lachlan has to have more power, overall strength than you say his name, Andrei. Is that correct or no? Yes. I'm the piano. Yeah. But I think that Andrei has a better hand. He's faster. He's more technical. I think he has more options.
SPEAKER_00: if lachlan can stop it inside and and he's not too too far in the losing position then i think that lachlan uh has a lane to win but i would favor andre in that match personally maybe three to one um because because of his speed his speed his technical ability uh experience yeah
SPEAKER_03: And do you know who they are, Pavlo? I mean, you know Lachlan, but do you know Andrei? Yeah, Andrei, I saw him a couple of times. I don't really follow him much, but I agree with Chance. If Lachlan will be able to stop it, he will win. He stopped me. You say that Lachlan is going to stop him, right?
SPEAKER_03: yeah i i'm not sure lachlan's speed is uh locking i mean he's he's not he's not a speedy guy at all if if i'm faster than him that's uh you know that's bad because i'm a slow cool so you know you don't find yourself fast either i'm not fast at all no okay okay it is strong maybe but i'm not fast at all and i think you have to petrenko about this much as well
SPEAKER_03: Yes, Oleg, you know these two guys, Plaklan and Adaev. Yes, with Andrei. I think Andrei will be more advantageous. I think he is more technical, but not great. I don't know much about them, but I think Andrei will be more advantageous.
SPEAKER_01: yeah uh all the thinking uh approximately the same as chance and me that uh technical technically uh andre is better and that he have better chances because of his technical abilities okay this one we know already oleg petrenko and chance show we all already talked about it paulo sundries we talked about it okay let's go to justin bishop thomas roses chance
SPEAKER_00: Um.
SPEAKER_00: yeah i think it's a really interesting match i think that uh it could go either way it's probably 50 50. justin obviously has a lot more experience especially pulling at a high level tom's is relatively new um tom's hand from everything that i've seen tom's hand is is really really really good uh but his arm maybe there's some holes in it um i think that if justin comes in with the right game plan and can uh get into
SPEAKER_01: Toms's weak point. I think that Justin might be able to control it. If he's not able to, then I think it's a grinder that I would favor Toms in. Somebody has weakness, but it is not your A game. Justin, A game is outside where Toms's in.
SPEAKER_01: i mean this is what we see but i mean we cannot say that justin doesn't have as good as hand you know because we saw him with a few months training he came in twice several mindawas yes he was heavier but still you know and so with uh when justin pulled rvj didn't he hit inside mostly
SPEAKER_01: i mean anyway he won the one round i saw even rob losing his wrist slightly you know to the bat you know and he said that now he's as good as that time with better endurance that's what he said yeah
SPEAKER_03: I think I would agree, but the majority of this is going to be in Justin's prep. If Justin did the right amount of effort to make that prep finished properly, if he's ready, as he used to be ready three, four, five years ago, if he will do that, he has a very good chance. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this is how it should be. I'm talking about not to talking about win, but you may come lose once or even twice. You must not give up. You must not. But I hate it. You don't lose when you are knocked down, you know.
SPEAKER_01: if you you are you lose when you refuse to get up so you need to train harder come back and win this is what what north americans should do and the oleg do you know these guys is
SPEAKER_03: Toms will win. He won the European Championship recently, if I'm not mistaken. I think he will win quite easily. Because I saw his fight. He has such a solid fight. He fights well in the hook.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Oleg is thinking that Toms got it because he has a very confident style and he said that most likely he's going to win relatively easy. Who's going to win? Toms will win relatively easy. Relatively easy? Wow. That's also interesting. That's also interesting. Yeah. So let's go to another one.
SPEAKER_00: Wagner, Bortolato, Ferit Osmanlı. I think that
SPEAKER_00: I favor Farid kind of a little bit heavy in this match. I think that Wagner is probably the stronger guy, but his endurance has not been so good in the past. So maybe Wagner, maybe if he can access or keep his wrist enough, maybe round one can be interesting. But I think Farid, maybe 70-30. So you are saying that Farid is going to stop him and tire him and win? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I understand. And how do you think, Pavlo? Yeah, I think relatively close to what chance show, but I think Ferit will not even have to stop him right away. They will sleep. They will maybe, you know, warning false start, whatever, and trying to grip.
SPEAKER_03: uh barcelona will guess out unfortunately yeah but a lot of this super strong guy but uh it was 150 plus kilos plus you know we are not getting any younger to carry that weight you're guessing out i mean it's it's hard so our sport supermatch needs endurance i mean if we're talking about uh
SPEAKER_03: I think it will be a tough fight.
SPEAKER_03: Farid will not be fast at the start, he will not impose his fight and the fight will be delayed. I think Wagner will win. If Farid can find the key, he will be fast and will start well, then Farid will be the winner.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he thinks that Farid need to be very fast at the start to stop him. And he thinks it's going to be a very, very grander. But yeah, he said that Bortolato is most likely favorite. Bortolato what? His favorite. Oh, Bortolato is his favorite. Okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I understand he needs to say that Ferit needs to be fast. Ferit needs to take Bortolato's hand to this side so he cannot put his shoulder. He needs to be staying here. Once you put your shoulder, yeah, then you feel like a big building is collapsing on your arm. You know, this is how he makes people feel, you know. And so let's go to another one. This is an interesting one, another one. Rino Masic versus Terence Opperman.
SPEAKER_00: So I know Terence used to be really, really good. And so I think that this match is just all about like what kind of shape Terence is. And if he comes back and, you know, he has a good comeback, like a lot of the guys that have been coming back, then I think it's,
SPEAKER_00: can be a really interesting match. But if he's not ready in his preparations yet for such a tough opponent, then it could look really one sided for for Rino, because Rino's is very, very legitimate, high level elite puller. So it's quite a tough comeback match for Terence, I think.
SPEAKER_01: I understand. Do you know the guy Mindaugas from Lithuania? I think the inside shoulder pressure guy. Did you see his match against Terence at Armours? I don't think I saw, no.
SPEAKER_01: yeah i mean he was he was going like this with the shoulder and then terence was toppling but terence elbow was getting out and terence just went inside and then he won the match uh inside those acts from yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i didn't see that match that's so i think mandalgas is is a pretty good opponent i mean uh didn't mandalgas beat sandras and armors not too long ago
SPEAKER_00: don't know and mendougas beat uh austin jaggers so if if uh terence is beating mendougas i think that says a lot in his preparations then i think it's very very interesting match i'm excited to see that now yeah and paulo do you know the guys uh i know but i don't know enough to you know to give my opinion about dimension okay how about petrenko that's nice
SPEAKER_03: I think he will win, almost 100%. I myself would like to fight with him. He is very young, talented, a good athlete. I think this is the future of armwrestling. One of such promising athletes.
SPEAKER_03: uh he said he said that almost hundred percent uh giving to reno and he said it's like almost hundred percent i think because this young very uh it's a future of arm wrestling that's what he said okay and uh he wished to pull him himself okay yeah yeah i mean the days are
SPEAKER_01: I mean, as long as we have life, as long as, you know, nothing like God protect us, a world war or something, you know, I'm alive. I will be organizing all of this. You know, we just dream. We do it together. And so let's go to ladies match.
SPEAKER_01: elizabeth versus carolina let's go chance you your one feet is in your one foot is in sweden the other foot is in florida so you probably have met carolina uh yeah yeah i met her uh golden arm last year okay yeah what do you what how do you see this match i see that the elizabeth is very strong and while carolina has tons of experience
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's going to be the power versus technique thing. I think that the... I favor Carolina in this match, Carolina Pettersson. I think that the only way that Elizabeth can win this match is if she's strong enough to win very fast. Like...
SPEAKER_00: ready go flash pen if if elizabeth is strong enough to go straight sideways then i think that that's really the only possibility because not only is carolina a lot more technical uh a lot more experience but she has the craziest endurance ever i mean all the time you see her in like five minute matches uh where elizabeth i don't think has ever had a match that long so uh yeah i favor carolina but i think it it's interesting
SPEAKER_03: okay i understand and paulo do you know the yeah i know them i know them both uh i think you were at the finals of the east versus west you saw her there winning right i i saw elizabeth winning yeah very powerful girl so yeah agree if uh carolina will be able to stop in any position then carolina will win if not it's very possible that elizabeth will flash because of her power she is very strong
SPEAKER_03: and her arm wrestling is i don't know if it's appropriate to say but uh you know ladies usually very sensitive in the wrist area yeah she is somehow not really she is you know copying and stuff and she's or straight down but yeah it's it's a little bit different so and she's very powerful so i agree here speed will speed will
SPEAKER_03: Most likely Oleg doesn't know about Elizabeth. Oleg, do you know about the girls? Carolina and Oleg? Yes. I don't know much, but I do know about them. Two good athletes. It's hard to choose one. I think 50-50, it depends on how they prepare. But two of them fight well and are great athletes.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he knows a little bit about girls, but he would not give to anybody, you know, bigger or less. He thinks it's a close 50-50 match. It depends whose prep is better. That's good that Oleg is following. That's good that Oleg is following. Yeah. And three more. Three more. Thanks for your super chat. I personally respect Pavlo so much. A good character. Honest person as far as I watch. What are his future plans? Does he have a goal to be the best?
SPEAKER_03: if i would not have that goal i would not be here i would not do what i'm doing yes i have that goal future plans uh i have a super match set in uh august with uh
SPEAKER_03: yes I'm waiting for that super match very much um because last time it went my way but super match is completely different because we have little more uh opportunities to fix our mistakes which I believe Marcio can do because he's very experienced but I will be so I have I have I have a question for you
SPEAKER_01: People criticize you for not having enough endurance. Did you work on this? Or you are saying that, I mean, if it goes to endurance game, you know, that is not necessary. Like, did you try more of finishing the match, overpowering him? Or did you make any plans just in case the match stops? I will tell you something before you answer. Like, for example,
SPEAKER_01: People say that supermatch requires endurance. Yes. Yeah, this is what they say. But I kind of agree and disagree. For example, if you were Arsene Lille and you pull in Devon Larratt,
SPEAKER_01: would you try to increase your endurance or would you try to be just even more flash pin or just more horsepower that the match doesn't even stop? I mean, why would you, I mean, you try all your life, you will never get an endurance that he has anyways, you understand? So your best chance is just finishing the guy, you know?
SPEAKER_03: like if you have five minutes of our time i will try to explain my vision of this okay yeah yeah yeah go ahead take a little bit so uh those people who criticizing my endurance is right yeah because of king of the table let's say as a great example uh i took the super match at the super heavyweight with uh i believe he's a great opponent and uh uh
SPEAKER_03: he is it's funny he's the last who wins the one right um and that's that's you know for me that's a level so I'm making decision of gaining weight and power
SPEAKER_03: to be stronger, to have a chance to win. So I did my mistakes during preparation and life makes some corrections because I got respiratory sickness two weeks before. So I did not make the final cut of the weight. So I've been there at my heaviest.
SPEAKER_03: so it was not about even endurance part but they're right i was pumped you know my carbs and intake and everything else was a mistake and i get a huge pump i couldn't really finish in my power i start top rolling which which i could and it's what it would match right in my eyes
SPEAKER_03: uh now uh if it was a very small super match for a first and second in uh north america between me and uh left-handed between me and jonathan breida if somebody talking about endurance it was a six uh round super match 17 ready goes it was finished at the seventh round
SPEAKER_03: after 45 minutes almost constant pulling and i wanted you know three and a half yeah uh so it was all about okay what's the difference now did you like train for it you think like just enough to get punched yeah yeah yes i change my training uh i make some adjustments and i change my diet
SPEAKER_03: i've been sitting on that weight for a little bit now it's not like a game over last four weeks so uh if uh if you will start comparing my endurance to uh devon's no i am not at devon's level uh if i am better than i was at king of the table yes much better okay okay okay i understand yes anyway so let's go to
SPEAKER_01: yeah it just seems like uh nobody wants to pull mendougas uh everyone keeps canceling on him right i don't know yanni said that he is injured but he yesterday he pulled 80 kilos at the arizona state probably maybe he was not healthy enough to pull
SPEAKER_01: uh this level yeah and then doug had to uh he replaced yeah he showed me his mri everything he really has some problems as well and then i said arthur and for a reason i had to cancel and now yeah there is so there is so and i mean that was people think that mr is just a referee but he is not easy of course the europeans in 85 to the wild way in 80 kilo
SPEAKER_01: and so how do you see this merchant i think uh i mean christo's been pulling a long time when did he start like 2003 or something yeah yeah the first time we pulled the same category was 2005 europeans yeah i don't remember he said that he pulled in 2002 as well
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so that was close. Hristo obviously has a lot of experience as a high-level athlete, very strong. I think that if he was able to set a hook, that he would be the favorite.
SPEAKER_00: I just think that maybe Mindaugas is going to prevent him from getting into position. I think Mindaugas has more endurance as well. So I think it could possibly be interesting if Hristo can set a hook or if Mindaugas is too cocky and allows Hristo into a hook, then I think it could become pretty interesting. But I think you have to favor Mindaugas in this. Yep.
SPEAKER_01: i hope i hope i hope janice also comes like healthy 100 i understand from janice's point that
SPEAKER_01: You need to be almost 100% to pull at this level. Arizona State level wasn't low either. There was, I think, Corey Miller and a few other guys. But I think that when you are pulling in diverse, you really need to be 100%. Even you are 90%, you don't want to take the risk here. And Pavlo, how do you see this?
SPEAKER_03: uh i've been pulling mindagas on a side table after uh arnold classic in 2019 i believe 19 yeah three weeks after i are super matched yeah and i saw your super match too yes so uh i will never never bet against mindagas
SPEAKER_03: okay he's a favorite yes okay so you know it sounds like you had no good memories with him no no very good memories absolutely very good memories uh no no no it's a table side table no no it was a very good memory so i learned how to arm wrestle that day okay okay
SPEAKER_03: yeah but yeah he's uh for his size and weight uh his ability of control of of control the match on the table in his favor is amazing yeah I mean overall I've been stronger bigger by maybe 30 kilos 40 kilos whatever but yeah it was 154 yeah he is yeah he impressed me yes yeah
SPEAKER_03: So then if you saw our Supermatch as well, you must be impressed by me as well. I'm joking. But I think still your level and his level is still very different because you're, you know, it's not comparable. Yeah, yeah. And Oleg, how do you see Mindaugas versus Hristo? I think Taras Aikis will win.
SPEAKER_03: yeah he thinks that parasites is favorite and easy favorite and his best move through the top he said i don't think that anybody can you know
SPEAKER_01: okay okay except you hanging yes no no i mean that was last year at the wars lost to daniel and he lost to risto yeah at the waffles but against it is so i mean he was very tired first he pulled with daniel long match and then he pulled against armenia
SPEAKER_01: long match armenian top role risto and yeah nobody saw the bin dagas and minagas won like this and right after that aristotle and won comfortably um okay let's go this match is also an incredible match people are underestimating emil but emil is very very strong guy right and left and he has won
SPEAKER_01: Daniel's weight category a few times, and Daniel also won the same category. So what do you guys think, Daniel Procopciuc versus Emil Emil Amirshadyan chance?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm not super familiar with the Armenian. I don't watch the lighter classes as much as I should sometimes. I know he's very powerful from what you've said. I've watched a couple of his matches, but personally, I think when it comes to left-handed and around Daniel's category, I will always pick Daniel to win. After training with him, I was just so impressed. Yeah, in Sicily, right? He's stronger, yeah?
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah he's he's so strong and uh it seems like he doesn't get any weaker the more he pulls which is pretty incredible i need to explain something guys uh petrenko was working today
SPEAKER_01: He was at the job. He get out of the job 10 o'clock. So that is why 10.30 we put it. And I apologize, Emil. Normally, I would never go into his minutes. But we are soon finishing anyways, maybe 15 more minutes.
SPEAKER_01: But we had to do it because Petrenko was working till 10 p.m. at his time, you know. So 10.30, right after that, we wanted him to go to home and just join us. What do you think, Oleg? Emil Emil Amirshadyan versus Daniel Prokopchuk. Left arm world title, 75 kilos. I think Daniel Prokopchuk
SPEAKER_03: I fought with him many times, behind the wheel, but still he is very strong and he has almost no weaknesses. He is versatile and I see that with each year he gets stronger and stronger. Emil is very strong and I also see his struggle, but still I give Daniel an advantage.
SPEAKER_03: he said that uh daniel is favorite because uh he pulled him on the side table many times he said that daniel almost doesn't have any weak uh weaknesses you know on a table he said also ml2 and emil is very strong but he said not on that level yet daniel is progressing uh year to year every time he's better and better okay then then uh paulo
SPEAKER_03: yeah i would agree and uh yeah daniel for kopchuk uh is uh favorite uh maybe yeah emil is very strong too and but daniel is probably close to 70 percent yeah so that that is seriously incredible match i don't know who's gonna win but i think my opinion that we will see
SPEAKER_01: an exciting match if one of them dominates the other one i will be very surprised but we will see and then let's go to do top ones first starts with gennady versus artem morozov chance
SPEAKER_00: As a fan, I think that's the match that I'm looking forward to on the card the most. I'm a huge fan of both Gennady and Morozov. I think I like the matchup because it's kind of the new versus the old, if you will. Morozov is only, what, 25, 26. Gennady's been at the top of the game a long time. They both have incredible endurance.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm really, really interested to see. Maybe it's just because I'm rooting for him, but I think that Morozov might be a slight favorite. I understand. And how do you see Oleg? I think it will be a very tough fight. They are both very strong. But in my opinion, the experience will win. Kikvinya will win.
SPEAKER_03: Although Morozov is very strong and it's really hard to predict who will win. I think only with the experience of Kikvinya he can impose a fight and even win with a trick.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Oleg thinks it's a great match and Morozov is very, very strong and Kvikvinya is very, very strong. But he thinks that Kvikvinya may be a slight favorite because of his experience. He may, you know, push his style on the table and may win because of that. And you?
SPEAKER_03: don't know uh it's uh it's the match i want to see for sure uh for sure grinder for sure not a mismatch uh i believe that morozov because he's so hungry he may he may be a little bit better in the prep but gennady have so much heart in arm wrestling
SPEAKER_01: that it's it's going to be incredible match and uh uh i'm very happy that i have a chance to see it from the you know life right yeah yeah yeah and it will be after your mess so you will be even like sit down relax and watch it and okay let's go jerry cadoret versus hermes gasparini people heavily favorites
SPEAKER_01: favors Ermes like around like 70 to 80 percent they say Ermes is gonna win and for sure Jerry is a guy to not underestimate that's all I say I am not saying this guy is gonna win that guy is gonna win but when when Jerry is coming ready prepared
SPEAKER_01: And then if he applies his game plan, he can make everybody's dream becoming a nightmare. From other side, we have Ermes. Future Legends already
SPEAKER_01: second is just considered you know because he made the levan bleed at the east versus west both jerry and hermes are uh number ones and hermes is capable of pulling in many different directions to finish the match how do you guys see the chance um
SPEAKER_00: Listen, I've counted Jerry out many times. I thought for sure Jerry would have nothing for Gennady, and I was wrong. Jerry ended up winning in a very close match. I thought Georgi would beat Gennady, and again, I was wrong. You mean Jerry?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, Jerry. I want to say that I think that Ermes will win, but I continuously count Jerry out, and I'm proven wrong over and over again. So I think I'm going to take Jerry in this match. I think if you watch Dave Chafee and Ermes, even Dave, when Dave presses, Ermes is coming off the back. So if Dave's press is giving Ermes a little bit of trouble, I think Jerry's press has the potential to give even more trouble.
SPEAKER_01: Do you realize that it wasn't the flop press that helped Dave to open Ermes' arm? He went with the side pressure. He kept Ermes' wrist flat with the side pressure. And then when he brought here, then he did the transition to the...
SPEAKER_01: uh shoulder uh pressure same as people are also saying that hermes trouble levan with the dead risk no he started with the incredible back pressure kept levan's wrist flat and then not flat but he couldn't really control and then after he stopped him and then he did the transition yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. But the thing is, is Jerry in the setup allows you to feel like the top role is the perfect move to beat him. And I think that if Ermes falls for that trap and decides just to, you know, from go try here, I think it's it's a very bad idea for Ermes. And if he does that.
SPEAKER_01: it's going to be a long match it gets drawn out and then anything can happen uh so i i think a lot of it comes to army's game plan so you are saying that hermes shouldn't fall into the trap that that jerry is tempting him yeah exactly exactly okay yeah and you paulo yeah styles make matches so uh for jerry hermes is a perfect opponent perfect
SPEAKER_03: uh if hermes will try to do what he best known for back pressure and top roll he screwed he screwed big time
SPEAKER_03: so if he if he watch enough videos how jerry pulled uh with even todd hutchins and with devon and he learned the lesson then he have a chance at least if he will try to top roll like everybody else like gennady like uh uh georgie he is screwed don't understand so you are saying that once ermes is committed to go
SPEAKER_01: fully pronated outside move, and then he will have all the pressure on his brachioradialis and he will not handle three rounds. But if he's arm resting more with the wrist and side, then there is a possibility. This is what you are saying. He will be able to, let's say, let's call it a hook. It's not exactly a hook, but let's say it's a hook. If he will be able to hook Jerry, then he will win. If not... Oh, you think Ermes is going to beat Jerry in hook?
SPEAKER_03: no it's not exactly a hook hook but it's to keep to prevent him from his position and flop and try to keep him flat okay so he should try to knock the top roll jerry yes yeah yeah i would like to hear what what what's that bad day trying to top roll jerry yeah yeah yeah um
SPEAKER_03: How about Oleg Petrenko? What do you think, my friend? Oleg, what do you think? I like Jerry's fight. I really like it. It's always interesting to watch him fight. It's not clear what will happen in the end. Jerry, as an athlete, is very strong. It seems to me that he has incredible strength.
SPEAKER_03: I like that he always teaches to the end. He fights to the end, until the blood from the nose goes away. But I will give the advantage to Gasparini, Ermes, because he is fast, technical and quite strong. Maybe Jerry is not stronger, but due to his technique of fighting, speed, the goal is that he will be the winner. But this is also a very
SPEAKER_03: yeah Alex saying that he loves Jerry as an arm wrestler he loves his style he loves that he's always going all the way to the end until until his nose nose started bleeding uh but he's saying that this time he will probably uh
SPEAKER_03: give a little bit of favor to Gasparini because of his technique and speed but he says it's it's not that it's big gap but it's very close match which I want to see but he said probably I would uh favor Gasparini a little bit okay I understand and before before um we finish I want to ask a few matches from the next month
SPEAKER_01: east versus west nine like short short predictions uh chance gennady versus devon rematch devon three to two three two this time devon is gonna win i think and paulo devon three zero three zero and and petrenko
SPEAKER_01: oh this time you all think the devil is gonna win this time how about ravers versus uh uh i'm really excited to see that uh i think rev is three zero oh you think that was gonna be the legend and power uh
SPEAKER_01: three two three two reverse yeah i think it was will beat leveson this time but uh it's i want to see that but reverse three two and and you oleg reverse okay how about how about chance uh tatashi's uh match
SPEAKER_01: Ibrahim Sago, Todd Hutchins. Todd Hutchins. Todd Hutchins. Todd is going to beat Ibrahim Sago? And you, Pavlo? Yeah, Todd will win. Todd will win. Any chance? If Todd comes in 100 kilos or heavier, then Todd will win.
SPEAKER_01: 105 kilo yeah yeah i mean it's the weight category okay the last one i will last one i will ask and then we can finish uh pauline versus ruslan i want to ask first petrenko okay and you paulo yeah i agree
SPEAKER_01: I'd take Paul 3-0. 3-0. Okay. Anyways, guys, there is one super chat and then it's a very short one.
SPEAKER_01: USS Liberty, never forget. Great show. Thanks again. Emil sent me here. Guys, thank you very much. And Emil, my friend, I apologize. We enter your time like 10 minutes. My friend, it was because Petrenko worked till 10, 10 p.m. with his time. And we could start only 10.30. So one hour and 10 minutes. Thank you very much, guys. Thank you, Chance. Hope to see you next in 10 days. Same to you, Pavlo. And
