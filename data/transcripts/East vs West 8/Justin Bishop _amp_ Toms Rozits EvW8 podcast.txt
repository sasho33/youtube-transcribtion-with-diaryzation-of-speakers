SPEAKER_01: alhamdulillah um even today i did a chest training not like like full force but better than last time hello this um thomas
SPEAKER_01: yeah and justin i think that will be a little bit intense both at the table and now at the podcast you know i think i think they will be really biting each other when i say bites you know what i mean like you know you will see and
SPEAKER_01: So I can't wait. My camera was up. Thomas was setting his camera. I saw he had a photo at the back side, a photo that Justin's wrist is uprooted, whatever. Most likely maybe Yanis match. I don't know. So he will be provoking him as far as I understand.
SPEAKER_01: Meyers Armwrestling great job with your slow motion video showing you getting right after he starts. Yeah, I mean, I have nothing like what I'm telling you Ray is just to me, one of the best guys in the community, the guy is he knows armwrestling is serving armwrestling is
SPEAKER_01: teaching people how to harmless is like one of the most useful and non-toxic guy you know so it is not about that but when i see those haters just go there you know and get started early it was in pain so i had to just go ahead i even told uh rhymes i said i mentioned like it has nothing to do with you but i didn't need to answer this um it's like i i am type of guy that you know i hate perception to
SPEAKER_01: win over the truth and facts, you know, just because there are many, you know. So, I mean, just... Ivan Kozlich, hello, hello, hello, my friend, hello, Ivan. Jonathan Paszkuevich, hello, hello, my friend, 44%. Stronger, higher, nice to see you, nice to see you. As well, my...
SPEAKER_01: good followers more strangers man hello hello my friends um your video again was very good yeah you need more more members more subscribers you're doing a great job and so let's see how it will be
SPEAKER_01: But this match, I'm very curious about it. I know that Justin will be stronger than last time he came here. And Thomas is very strong guy, especially against the outside pullers. And we will see.
SPEAKER_01: one roach you should just ignore the haters don't waste your no my friend it's not about the haters it is about the good people you know that i don't want them to believe in those perception games that the haters is just not on my concert they are ill people you know they they they hate but they just can't stop following you whenever i dislike someone i ignore that person forever and just like i ignore it
SPEAKER_01: these people when they dislike they just like they are there on the channel before anyone else you know so i think you know they are just there to spread you know negativity i feel sorry for them um i think it was sandersman um
SPEAKER_01: Phil Woody, welcome our Mustang fan. Yeah, Phil Woody is one of the best guys also. Who dangerous push looking forward to this matchup? Yes, they are. I don't know how this match is going to go. I have no idea. Engin 2001 versus Engin 2023. There are 20 kilo difference, but still 2001 would kill me now.
SPEAKER_01: I said thank you, thank you. 44% stronger. Yeah. So, soon they are coming. And then I think after this one, probably four more four more podcasts, and then
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, I do once in a while. Whenever I show under that video, you know, I don't know who is behind it. And then I'm like, okay, I'm just gonna make a video, you know, and then just one of the show.
SPEAKER_01: Evan Roche, my kids and I watch your match and they now are your fans 109%. They are less than 10 years old. I'm glad you're back on TV. Just tell them I said hello and I'm happy that they are my fans. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think many of the new generation, they don't know who I am as an arm master. And they, I don't know, they are surprised when John talks highly. Once he said that, like, I may be the, if he didn't exist, I would be the, like, God or something, which I don't think I deserve. They will say the same thing.
SPEAKER_01: Jerry says same thing, Travis says similar things, you know, but this is not because I think I deserve or something, but this is good to hear from those people because they know what arm wrestling is. But it is very, very hard to make new fans to believe in what they say. They are like, oh, they are like streaming, they are talking like...
SPEAKER_01: I don't exaggerate it or something. Whatever. Yeah, I'm not done. You know, I just started. I just started. I would like to I'm motivated. I just like last almost two years. It was so hard for me to go to gym and train. Like many times I went to even gym and gym is only 300 meter from here. Only 300 meters. And
SPEAKER_01: And then, but I went there, I look at the weights, weights look at me and just, I just came home and I didn't want to train, but now I am motivated. I'm motivated. Yeah. Um, the fist is not close, but it is just like, I don't move the,
SPEAKER_01: finger or wrist but yeah anyway so i feel motivated um if elbows neck i have serious neck issues you know maybe you see open i'm moving my and so if everything goes well i don't know i just can't wait to compete again you know i just can't can't wait hello burning tendons yeah yeah and
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes, I was competing. I competed like all those heavyweights, like I was 63 kilos. I gave, I really troubled the hand of the super heavyweight world champion, Eric Walker at that time. It was only like six, seven months ago. I gave a very good match to Prime Rambat in 97. It was almost like 25 seconds and then my thumb get dislocated.
SPEAKER_01: And I have wins against Michael Todd, Travis Bergens. I don't know. I was pulling many weight classes. Yeah, I was good. I was good. Yeah. And, but... Oh, yeah. They suggested me surgery, but they said maybe I couldn't compete anymore. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Hermes and Devon, I have no idea. I have no idea. Devon now, pronto, he has a few matches, but that match is going to happen sooner or later. Sooner or later, it's going to happen. Guys,
SPEAKER_01: We go by, how to say, like event to event, you know, mostly, except a few times, you know, I go, I just look at the results and then decide what would be the best choice for the next one. But of course there are matches like Devon versus Dennis. It has to happen at some point, but I kind of feel it's gonna happen this year.
SPEAKER_01: yeah my friends wreck wrecking arms my my left side was totally like gone my arm was left side no signal maybe 30 centimeters maximum you know and it was just like my chest was gone only ribs you could see
SPEAKER_01: i'm not fighting my friend i'm just answering their perception games that they try to attack and then create a perception negative perception there are a lot of good people that may believe what they are doing so i just showed you the the truth you know but i realized that whenever and end of this year i plan to pull if i don't pull any earlier
SPEAKER_01: um what was the injury that made you so the the neck injury i mean i think most of my arm injuries are also because of my neck you know like the signals needs to come you know signals need to come like healthy from the brain any problem on the neck trapezius like back here you know just also causing your
SPEAKER_01: Ah, Mario East versus West 10 is planned to be the biggest event in the history, the best event in the history. But who knows? You know, it's just planned. The planning and reality sometimes. Hello, Justin. Can you hear me?
SPEAKER_01: I think I can hear you now. Just give me a second, please. You're good. You're good. Can you turn it sideways like this? Yeah, sideways. Okay. Oh, look at you. How cute are you? Nice, right?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, she's right there. You've been thinking about me. Yep, it looks like it. They they started already. What did I tell you guys? Yeah. So Justin, this guy is trying to provocate you. Trying to what? Provoke you. I'll provoke me now.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I saw. I got three kids. You better try a little harder. Yeah, you saw you see the photo right behind you. Yeah. I see that. Nobody don't see I want $20,000 that day. I'm wrestling. Yeah. I didn't let me be quiet.
SPEAKER_00: He said we wait. Okay. Thomas, what is that photo? Who is that at the other side of Justin? Actually, I don't remember. I just make a photo from YouTube and I don't remember. I didn't pay attention for that. I think it's mine and Luke's match. Yeah, looks like it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, there is a question, and it would not be a problem to invite that again at the same time that again is from Armenia, not from Russia. Anyway, so so let's let's start. You know, I'm very curious about your match. Very curious.
SPEAKER_01: Justin, you have proved yourself many times. And my guess is you will be stronger than last time you came to East versus West because I think it was your first event after a long break. And Thomas is very, very effective against the outside pullers.
SPEAKER_01: especially. And you are an outside puller. And I just really have no clue how this match I can see the matches going. Either way, how do you see Justin? Do you do you give any chances to your opponent or I know you don't want to talk so much shit. You just want to do the job. But still, what do you think?
SPEAKER_02: No, I mean, if all goes as planned, it's going to be an easy day. You know, 3-0. Does it always go as planned? You know, not really, but considering all things, I got experience. I'm more well-rounded, probably more declarated. I mean, there's very few things I think this kid's got on me.
SPEAKER_02: to be honest with you. Um, I would definitely be a lot stronger than the last time you seen me. That was about two months of training after about a year and a half layoff this time, it'd be about six months of training. So, you know, I feel good. I think, um, what makes me feel most confident is my arms actually healthy is, uh, you know, something that hasn't happened in quite a while. Um, but you know,
SPEAKER_02: I've been doing my research on him too. You know, he's another one of them cats that don't like to put their losses out there. All you see is them dominating people until two weeks ago when he was getting beat up by the refs. You didn't think I seen that, but I seen that over there. But yeah, I feel pretty good about it. I don't think the kids got a chance. Obviously all of Europe thinks I don't have a chance, but that ain't nothing new.
SPEAKER_00: And Oli, what's your response, Tomas? Yeah, well, I think he had no chance because there is not much options for him. So if you go outside, zero chance. Inside, okay, let's fight inside. My right hand finally started to recover. I had a lot of tournaments before.
SPEAKER_00: Then I go to Europe and my right hand was like in worst shape ever. So that's why it was like that. So it's getting better. So I will do my best. And what do you think your winning chance, Thomas? 3-0. 3-0? All right.
SPEAKER_00: Is it going to be easy or hard, Thomas? I think it's going to be quite easy, actually. Because no matter outside or inside, if my right hand is in good shape, so it's strong both ways, so I don't care, actually. What do you mean, if? You got two weeks, baby. You better hope it's in shape right now. Yeah, it's getting better every day, so...
SPEAKER_02: uh i don't know man y'all be trying to act like y'all confident like in that video you made you seem confident but by the end of the video you weren't too sure you know but i like it i like it you you mean the video that he challenged you like you said like he called you something you know like don't be like this this you're talking about that video uh yeah i guess it's the one where him and yannis and ray something yeah
SPEAKER_02: And then he seemed pretty confident, and then Giannis starts talking, and it seems like he got him to thinking, like, oh, this guy's actually pretty good. You know, hey, show up with that same. You don't see the same confidence right now, right? This is what you're seeing. No, I didn't see it by the end of that video. You know, it had, you know, it's all right. Look, I'm going to get you in so many ways, like not just arm wrestling. This is what I'm going to show you.
SPEAKER_02: those european arm wrestlers aren't quite as good at that y'all got a couple that are but i'm gonna i'm gonna screw with your head a little bit too not just your arm i like you though man i like you so i'm gonna enjoy doing it yeah and you both will compete with your hats on right no of course definitely
SPEAKER_01: and and you're gonna you're gonna have your cowboy hat or this one just me yeah i'll no i always wear my bear hat when i arm wrestle okay the other one okay yeah yeah this one yeah i understand yeah i don't know i i just can't wait you know i i i know that you are also very effective
SPEAKER_01: And how much better do you think you are? I know last time you came here, it was only two months because you and I, like whenever I offer you, you said, Engin, I just started two months ago. Like I'm not in top shape, but I'm healthy at least. This is what you were saying. And today you are saying you are healthy, but you also look, the photos that you are sharing,
SPEAKER_02: look much bigger so like are you like much stronger than last time you came here or a little bit like 10 or something it's hard to say i when i went to pullman to august i really didn't um i wasn't strength building you know i was mostly trying to get in shape getting good health because in that particular match i felt like i was already strong enough i just needed to be in shape and have good endurance and uh you know
SPEAKER_02: I didn't want to hurt myself between that time too, because I knew I wasn't in prime shape to be, you know, maxing out every week. But this, I've been strength training now for many, many weeks. I'm hitting PRs on a lot of lifts. I don't feel weak anywhere. So if my man goes out there and does what he says, kudos to him. You beat the best version of me that's been in several years. But I don't see it happening.
SPEAKER_01: Like compared to your shape against Rob's regions. Like how close are you to that shape? Right there. I would say right there, if not better, with better endurance. Okay. So Thomas, have you seen his match against Rob? Actually, if you ask, I don't remember. I haven't seen it or I just don't remember.
SPEAKER_01: I don't remember. Quit lying. You got that picture on your ceiling of me right now. Stop lying. This is the match. No. No, that ain't it. He beat him first round, I think, first round. And then I think you lost, but, you know, Rob Vision, like, and you were just up to the middleweight, as far as I remember. You were, before then, you were like 165s, and then you went up to
SPEAKER_02: The higher category later on. Well, what a lot of people don't know about the, the WAL super match series is I wanted to compete at lightweight and they really, they never would set me a matchup at lightweight. They wanted me to compete at middleweight and, um, I pretty much beat pretty much beat everybody, but, um, storm and, um, RBJ and I just kind of ran out. I ran out of gas on the, the match with RBJ.
SPEAKER_01: And what's your weight right now? Ah, like 192. And only 5 pounds. Only 5 pounds. Okay, yeah. And Thomas, we saw you at the European Championships. You did incredibly good with left arm, right arm. Against outside pullers, you did very well.
SPEAKER_01: to Bulgarian the hook you has defeated you and mainly mainly uh Justin is an outside full of top rollers and people talks about your hand strength and your side pressure and so you are basically saying that if Justin goes outside there is no way for him is that what you are saying yeah that's what I'm saying outside definitely inside gonna be the same
SPEAKER_00: I think so. Because yeah, outside definitely my hand is good shape, side pressure, good shape. So you'll see. It's going to be hard for him to go through. I understand. And what's your weight, Thomas? 88, 89, something like this. So, okay. So you need to, when you say like this, with clothes or without clothes?
SPEAKER_01: I just been on the weights with my clothes. It was 89. Okay, so you need to lose like maybe maximum two kilos. Okay. Yeah. Did you did you get any any help from Yannis about your preparation? He told you how to pull because he has some experience from the past. He ain't listening. If he did. I think he will be there. So he will be
SPEAKER_01: with us with me and no I mean I mean during the preparation during the preparation did you tell you where to focus more and this or you just did your regular regular training basically just a regular training like a regular one so I understand so you say you're gonna win three zero and so let's see let's see how it will be it is as I said you know both of you are very dangerous plus
SPEAKER_01: you both going outside and I just can't wait. I just can't wait. I just, you will for sure excite me to see you guys up there at the stage, you know, and facing each other. Let's see. Let's see. It is, it is, you know, when you win, like it is easier to get another match, you know? So I think, I think, yeah,
SPEAKER_01: And Thomas, is this stage important for you? East versus West stage? Is it like for you, like, do you have any further plans for like even up to the title someday? Yeah, of course it's important for me. That's why I'm here. And I was really thankful for that opportunity to go through that qualifications, then qualification finals.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you for this opportunity, definitely. It's a big stage for me. And I'm not going to stop, so. You're going to use this opportunity. By the way, I also thank you for just coming, competing, and then deserving to be here. Nobody is giving you favor. You just deserve it with your own, you know, just success. Yeah, let's see. Let's see how it will be. And you, Justin.
SPEAKER_01: you have no, no, how to say there is no other option than winning, right? Like, especially after losing in Douglas, you cannot afford another one. So I kind of feel like you took it serious enough and you are coming here well prepared. And so like, honestly, like how do you see your winning chances? Like from your hearts, do you feel like confident?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, I always come in confident. I mean, you come in worried, you know, emotionally driven like that, then you make mistakes. So I feel like the, you know, calm, confident, cool, cool headed is the way to be. Um, it really doesn't matter to the opponent. I try to take the same mindset. Um, you know, adding that I didn't do as well as I would like to in my last match, definitely adds motivation because.
SPEAKER_02: I've set a standard for myself where I like to compete at. I mean, given Mindy's probably top five at that weight class in the world, so I'm not terribly upset with that knowing the preparation I put in, but either way, it goes down as a loss. He was very close. He was a very close one, yeah. It could go either way.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, like 1-0 and then 1-1, 2-1, 2-2, and then 3-2. He could go either way, but as you said, his endurance was better than yours at the final round, yeah. I think, you know, I'll have the same advantage going into this match as I did with that one. A lot of... You don't have a lot of...
SPEAKER_02: great top rollers on that side as you do say hookers you're going to face way more hookers than you are really good top rollers versus you know it's the opposite over here so i think um i think i'm gonna give him some some trouble in the setups and well i'm gonna feed him some stuff he never felt before and we'll see how he reacts to it you know it could be strong enough to shut it down you know but he's gonna have to do that several times in several different ways
SPEAKER_01: Because, you know, I make good adjustments. That's something I don't think he does too well. I think he's one trick pony. The question, you watch his matches at the Europeans, Justin? Watch every match on the internet that he has. But did you watch his last, like last month, there was European Championship. Did you watch the class? Yeah. Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead.
SPEAKER_02: go ahead i was gonna say you know um what's how you say his name christoph that yeah i mean he's pulling yeah i seen i seen him pulling with him and see what he don't know is i pulled with him when i came in november and he better bring way more than you brought with that guy because i didn't have any trouble with him after my super match so okay all those matches
SPEAKER_00: yeah those moldavian guys just got lucky because i was in a my right hand was in bad shape so i hear you you know hey you know the difference between excuse and a reason there is not one we'll see okay so looks like right now uh 42 volts
SPEAKER_01: 68, 69% is saying that Justin is winning and 31% says Tom's winning. Let's see how it will be. Thomas, you are underdog as of now. Do you think that it is... Look at how Justin is laughing. Do you think that it is because Justin is more famous than you are or people doesn't know about you? Do you think it may be the reason?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's the reason, of course, you know. A lot of guys know Justin, you know, friends or whatever. They are just voting for them, just they are hoping he will win, not they are predicting, you know. Okay. But you're going to show people who you are and they will get to know you, right, this time? Of course, they will finally get to know me, so.
SPEAKER_01: there's the point you know okay okay i understand yeah so guys i'm an organizer i'm just all all i do is just trying to save the poster don't get me wrong you know and so yeah let let let's talk about some um other matches mindagas versus haristo justin how do you see this match uh i think mindy's gonna wax him
SPEAKER_02: I like Kristoff, but I think it's a bad style for him. Mendy's really good at getting outside of your palm and not getting that wrist contact. And it can go all day. So I got Mendy. And you, Thomas? I think actually the same. Do you think Mindagos is going to beat Hristo? Sorry? Do you think Mindagos is going to beat Hristo?
SPEAKER_00: I think yes, he will open his hand and finish him with an open position. Yeah, so you are not, you are not any, like how to say, even your own experience, like you don't give chance to Hristo? Hard to say, you know, probably if he is going to be better than in Europe, then he have chance.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think that Mindaugas can beat you? Or because he is pulling outside, his chances are not so high? Mindaugas can't, I guess. I think so. Mindaugas can't beat me. It's because he's attacking to your strongest area. Yes, and that's the reason. I understand. So, Chancho versus Petrenko, Justin.
SPEAKER_02: I think Chance's style is mostly because of this reason, but his style is just terrible for Petrenko. And I think Chance is big enough and his style is good enough that he don't run out of gas. He can win this. I see it. And to be honest, if he wins, I think it'll be a sweep. I don't think he can go in the trenches and win a 3-2 match.
SPEAKER_01: So it's going to be 3-0 or 3-1 if he wins. And I'm going to go with... Yeah, so you're saying that basically if what he does works, it's going to work three times in a row. If it doesn't work, then it's not going to work at all. This is what you're saying. Yeah. Basically, yeah. I understand. And do you know Chen's show, Tom's? Do you follow? Of course I know that, guys. But I'm not that...
SPEAKER_00: I don't have enough time to follow to every matches, every tournament and watch everything. So I think they're going to be close match. But I don't follow so, so hard to every match. So it's hard to say anything for about that. Okay. You, you, you know, Petrenko, right? Petrenko was the opponent of Raimon Antonovic. Yeah. Yeah. I've been with the rivals together.
SPEAKER_01: We are with that super much. Yeah. I understand. So you cannot predict because you don't have enough information. Basically, yes. Okay, I understand. And this one, I don't think that you will be objective, Thomas. Pablo versus Sandris. I think Sandris is going to lose.
SPEAKER_01: Lose? Yeah, maybe. I think so. Wow, it's interesting to hear that from a Latvian. I thought you were going to say Sandris is going to destroy. I thought because you are Latvian, I thought you were going to say. Why do you think that Sandris is going to lose? Last time I feel him, he's too much competing right now, I think. He's not going to be ready for this match, probably.
SPEAKER_02: I understand. Oh yeah. Well, that's interesting to hear. Yeah. And Justin, how do you see that match? Well, based on this new information, uh, I mean, I was going to pick Pablo. I thought it'd be an all out war and Pablo's he's war, war ready and ridiculously strong. Like his static power is,
SPEAKER_02: just through the roof. The only thing I was worried about is the height difference, you know, and the length in the arms. And I think if it stays inside, I think Sanders would definitely lose. But I mean, I'm gonna go with Pablo. Okay. Okay. And let's go. How about the ladies, Carolina versus Elizabeth?
SPEAKER_01: Do you know them, Justin? Not really. Not enough to, you know, make an accurate prediction. And you, Thomas? Yeah, same for me. I don't know about these girls. Okay. Okay. So, Reno Masic versus Terrence Opperman.
SPEAKER_02: Any prediction from either of you? Not from me. I'm trying to remember the faces because I'm better with faces. What weight is this again that I remember? This is going to be 115 kilos. Okay, yeah. It's not the guy that I was thinking of. Yeah, kind of same thing. Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah, I know the guy on the right.
SPEAKER_01: got on the left i'm not sure of yeah okay so basically you guys don't have much clue about this one either so i used to keep going i said i used to keep up i used to keep up with it a lot more man three kids in this business it's hard to do yeah yeah yeah yeah i understand yeah i understand yeah and
SPEAKER_01: so let's go to emil amirshadian versus daniel uh you remember justin you went to moldova in 2018 there there there was a long right arm match maybe you follow or not in 70 kilo daniel pulling what's pulling against an armenian the armenian top rolled the daniel and it was a long match
SPEAKER_01: very long match and Armenia ended up winning and then there was some protests, rematch, something happened, I don't remember exactly. But do you remember such match or not? Yeah, it was finals, wasn't it? No, it wasn't finals. They killed each other. The final was Mindaugas and Daniel, which Mindaugas won, yeah. So these guys are going to pull with left arm, Daniel and Emil Amirshadian.
SPEAKER_01: and it's going to be for the world title for 165 and they are very strong guys both of them are strong okay then how about you thomas do you know anything about emil or you i know i'm sure you know daniel no of course i know daniel i don't know that uh other guy so yeah okay yeah i just know daniel is beast so i think he's gonna take uh take this match
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Emil is the guy that, not the last recent AMC, but one before, he top-rolled Alain Zola, and it was a very tough match, which Alain won with a dead wrist. Yeah, but Emil is not someone to underestimate, yeah. And there is a little personal, this match, a little, after that Moldova event in 2018, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: How about Wagner Bortolato versus Ferit Osmanlı? Any prediction with this one? Justin, I'm sure you know Ferit, but... Yeah, I want to go with Wagner, but every time I do, his gas tank just lets me down. See, I can see him blasting through a wind or two and then giving out a gas at the end, so...
SPEAKER_02: I'd probably lean more towards Barrett in a war. So you are expecting a close match that maybe the score will be determined by the endurance factor? Yeah, I think so. Because, I mean, Wagner's looking really strong right now. If you look at some of his lifts, he's looking retarded. And that means something. I don't know how long it's going to mean something, you know, but.
SPEAKER_01: or if he can make it effective. But, you know, if they're both committed to going inside, I can see Wagner getting a win or two. I just don't know that he can do it three times. So. I have a question. Just imagine that if you could beat Thomas, like, would you be ready to pull someone like Daniel at some point? I'm not above pulling Daniel.
SPEAKER_01: What did you say, Thomas? What did you ask? I asked him if he somehow beats you, if he beats you, then would he pull against Daniel as well? I asked you, Justin. If I beat Justin? No, if Justin beats you, if he would be willing to pull Daniel, that's what I asked him. Daniel.
SPEAKER_00: yeah okay i don't know i'm always like ready but uh hard to say depends yeah yeah tomorrow i'll pull that guy tomorrow
SPEAKER_02: Tomorrow. Okay. Yeah. Do you, do you think, what do you think about Daniel? Do you think that, you know, like he looks not so big, but like, do you find him dangerous, Justin? Oh yeah. Yeah. Anytime, uh, you that have that kind of static power and endurance, it's dangerous. And what people fail to look at is the way he's built and the way arm wrestles, he does it.
SPEAKER_02: really well and it puts top rollers in a bad spot the same way todd hutchins uses his short arm in the strap is the same way you know same way daniel brings you down to the center of the table before the match even starts you're starting you feel like you're starting opened up you know he's got it down but i personally would have rather pulled him to mindy because i know what to expect you know with mindy i have to have three or four different setups ready to go
SPEAKER_01: But Daniel, he's probably not going to top roll. So, you know. Lately, he started to top roll as well. Lately, I saw. Yeah. Yeah, he's going outside, especially he did against two Americans. He even did against David Samusha. He went totally outside in those three super matches, yeah. And Thomas, if you win against Justin,
SPEAKER_01: you would probably most likely prefer to pull someone from North America, right? This is what I think that this is better because if the Europe, all the European guys are pulling at the valve at the Europeans all the time. So the interesting matchups are against the North Americans. Oh yeah. Because of, you know, it's different hands. We can pull each other like mostly.
SPEAKER_01: mostly time in Europe, you can meet those guys in some after pools or somewhere else. And that's more fun to pull American guys, you know. Do you think, Justin, do you think that Thomas will have an opportunity to pull another American guy or he will be going back to the qualification to come back? Ah, the latter. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: i usually i'm they call me to stop the hype trains around here so i feel like that's what that's what i'm doing here he's just going to shut down the hype train on on top rollable tom we're going to shut all that down let me smile for you thomas in that video you look very confident but right now you look very calm why is that you are not the same guy that
SPEAKER_00: was calling him, like, don't be a pussy or something, you know? No, no. I'm not that talkative, you know? And I'm always, like, silent and... Say again? I'm not that talkative guy, you know? I'm always, like, a silent one. Calm, easygoing guy, huh? Not what I heard.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And then look at Justin. He just, he just can't stop. No, that's not what I heard, bro. I heard you was running around there telling everybody he was going to beat them when you won that qualifier. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I remember. Yeah. After, after him on the phone. Yeah. Yeah. Don't sit down now. I watch, I listen.
SPEAKER_01: What was there? You remember, Thomas, after you won the finals in Istanbul, you said you are ready to kick anybody's ass. This is what he's saying. Justin is reminding you. You were not at that time. Yeah, that's true. Now, I heard he went around telling Paul and Doug and all these guys they're next. Doug are next. Doug gonna be next after you.
SPEAKER_01: Ah, you got to make it there first. Okay. Oh, you're going to pull Doug Ehrlich after you beat Justin? Is that what you're saying? Yes, that's what I'm saying. Okay, okay. And you have no intention to go back to the qualifications, right? You're going to just make sure that you're going to get the next match by beating Bishop. Definitely. I'm not going back. I'm not here to go back, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Okay. So let's, let's talk about what you say, Justin. I was going to say a good, here's, here's something good to run. Think about, right. When I dust him and Mindaugas dust, uh, what's his name? They can run it back and maybe he can get a win on, um, referee guy and me and Mindy can run it back. Or you can just do a rematch with Mindaugas. Yeah. Either one him or him or, uh, Daniel.
SPEAKER_01: But yeah, I figured that'd be good to let Kristoff and him run it back. I'm sure he's won some revenge off that. Okay. You really wouldn't be going backwards is what I'm saying, you know, that way. Let's see. Let's see if this matches and then we will have some good ideas for the future as well. And Thomas, what do you think about Morozov versus Gennady?
SPEAKER_00: Last two matches, I will ask. Morozov looks incredibly strong. I saw his last match. It was just crazy strong. I think Morozov is going to win. He looks so huge and strong and confident. I think he's a beast right now. The only thing is about Gennady.
SPEAKER_01: I mean he was underdog on the polls against Michael against Dave against that one and he only was was favorite as far as I remember, other than he was favorite against Jerry and he lost that match so.
SPEAKER_01: I kind of think that Gennady is not someone to underestimate. Yes, Morozov looks incredibly strong, but the Gennady is just like, I don't know why people doesn't really give him so much credit, but the guy is very dangerous. Like I wouldn't want to be at the other side of the table, neither with Morozov. But I mean, Gennady mentally, spiritually, the guy is just so strong that, you know, he just, you think that, you know, he's done.
SPEAKER_01: And then somehow he just comes out of grave, you know, you thought that you buried him, but you realize that he's still breathing, you know, and then he just comes out from the grave and then shows that, you know, he's still alive. So I don't know how that match is going to go either. You know, I'm like almost like same as your match with Justin.
SPEAKER_01: Like this match, I also don't know. You both will go outside. It is not that easy to go outside against Justin either. What he did to Minda Agos on a special round one was just like very, very, very impressive. Man, I know that your hands, wrists, everything also very strong, your side pressure. So I really don't have any clue about your match.
SPEAKER_01: And I really don't have any clue about Morozov versus... I don't have any clue. Morozov versus Gennady, I don't know. Morozov is just improving. He's very strong. Gennady is someone that never gives up. We will see. And you, Justin, how do you see that? This is probably the hardest match for me because I saw Gennady...
SPEAKER_02: was going to lose his last two matches and he, he want them in impressive fashion. And, uh, I mean, you pretty much nailed it when it comes to Gennady. And, uh, I said, um, last year that I saw Artem would be the first guy to beat LeBron eventually. Um, so I don't know. I wouldn't bet any money on, on that match. Uh, I would, I would think that you give Gennady the, the endurance
SPEAKER_02: uh edge but then you go watch uh rose i'll pull and he's got a gas tank too so you know i think i think he'll be in better shape or overall not competing with his right arm the last couple months that i've seen i don't know if he has or not but and cannot he's been through since november he didn't compete
SPEAKER_02: Morozov, he's super healthy right now and strong. And that means something, especially with these big guys. It means something, you know. And Gennady's been going through the grind in the last couple months. So I don't know. I think I would lean towards Morozov over Gennady, but it's 3-2 one way or the other. I don't see any guy dominating. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: uh alex i here is the email address i mean we always share the email address if you wouldn't receive just send us because i don't know what you are saying but right here just please send us your name your
SPEAKER_01: uh ordering and then i will send you a cargo is because we have all the details on the cargo right here the email address so i am not sure about your intention but just if you are really as you say just please write the email to us um yeah and then and then jerry versus jerry versus uh
SPEAKER_01: How do you see the Toms? I think it's going to be a close match as well. Like two, three, both ways. It's going to be a hard one, I think. Like a long match. Something like that. Long match you are expecting? Do you see if it is a long match? Who do you see winning if it is a really long one?
SPEAKER_01: probably jerry so you are saying that this is going to be a long match and then jerry is going to win there is a super chat sorry person person project prodigy good luck to both for these great pullers amazing mashup engine keep it up thank you very much my friend thank you for your super chat and sorry sometimes during the
SPEAKER_01: argument um conversation i forget yeah okay what were you saying uh you are saying that it's gonna be a long match and then jerry is gonna win this is what you are saying right thomas you're gonna take this match with the three two or something with long hard much i understand so you don't see a domination from either side
SPEAKER_02: I don't think someone will dominate in this match. Close match. And you, Justin? I think the same thing. I think the longer it goes, the more it's going to favor Jerry. It's hard for me to bet against Hermes because he was always my favorite puller from when I started. One of my three favorite pullers when I started, so I'm a little biased, but
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I think overall Hermes is probably stronger, but the problem is, is the stylistic matchup for him is just not good. You know, uh, usually you're fine being the top brother with a guy flopping his wrist over, but when it's Jerry, it's not, it's not normal. It's no longer, uh, you know, a normal match or, um, but I don't, I don't see, uh, I don't see Hermes winning to be honest.
SPEAKER_02: Even after his impressive performance against LaVon, I thought it was impressive anyway. I don't see him pinning Jerry three times and knowing the only way you're going to beat Jerry is to outlast him or get him past his shoulder on the go the way Devin did or the way Chafee does.
SPEAKER_02: You know, if he doesn't do that, which I don't think he's strong enough to do it, to be honest, he's in for a long day and his gas tank just isn't as big as Jerry's. So I got to go with Jerry. So you are saying that if Ernest wants to win, he needs to dominate him? Yeah, quick, fast, get it over with. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like I would be...
SPEAKER_02: Rene Valladares- flash to the side flash to the side after about that third if you don't get a pin get a restart try it again don't sit there and waste all your energy, and you know be strategic. Rene Valladares- We will see if we will see like these are very, very good matches very, very tough matches and. Rene Valladares- yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know in every event, there are always some surprises like we are thinking something but something different happens like.
SPEAKER_01: Like Devon versus Gennady, I thought the round one, the first stop, everything was over. Yeah, people says there was elbow palm, no, maybe they are right, yes. But still, you know, nobody expected that Devon gas out, would gas out, you know. I thought that, wow, what a mismatch. I said, you know, like, it's over, you know, finished. But as I said, you know, Gennady, you cannot underestimate him.
SPEAKER_02: Let's see how it will be. They will pull in August again. How do you see that this time will be different? Justin, or you think that there is a possibility the same thing to repeat again? I think Devin will probably come out a little better. I think Devin's had, I think Devin's a little more dedicated to getting stronger right now. He literally does nothing but arm wrestle. So how many people do you know that can say that?
SPEAKER_02: And like we was just talking about, Gennady's getting put through the grinder. You know, he's, he doesn't really have these long breaks like these other guys that he's arm wrestling. I wouldn't say Devin has a long break, but you, you, you get what I'm saying. Do you think that the problem of Devin on that day was about the strength or about the strategy?
SPEAKER_02: It's hard to say. I don't think he expected Gennady to have that kind of will to win. You know, I think he thought he broke him, and he didn't. I don't know. I mean, obviously, being stronger would have helped him out, you know, but I don't know. I think it's a combination of things. I think he ran into somebody just like himself who's just not willing to lose and who's smart at arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think Devon wants to not only pin the guy, he wants to mentally destroy the guy and accept that loss. And Gennady refused this. Even though how Devon was dominant with the first start, I thought that Gennady would be mentally down, but he was not. The guy is just dangerous. And how do you see if they pull again, Thomas?
SPEAKER_00: Devon and Gennady, you were there, right? You were there. Yeah, I've been there. I was watching the match. It was an incredible match. I think if there's going to be a rematch, Devon will come more ready, more aggressive. Maybe without that, you know, I'm going to bleed you here with the holding and everything, like try to pin him fast.
SPEAKER_01: Or his endurance actually is quite good, so maybe he will do the same strategy, just he's going to be more prepared, I think. You are saying that he will come there better prepared and then he may be doing the same exact thing. But after he lost, he said that it was because of his ego that caused that loss. So do you think that he may still do the same thing?
SPEAKER_01: Quite the same, yeah, just to prepare them more aggressive. Yeah, I don't know. If I was Devin, I wouldn't play around this time. If I had a chance, I would pin the guy because last time he tried to gas Gennady out and looks like he gassed out, you know, so he wouldn't want to do that because I asked Devin, could you pin him on that first start? He said, yeah, I could pin him.
SPEAKER_01: so all he needed to do that do that three times you know not not like so much playing around because uh that i'm sure that he didn't feel so good you know after that match that i'm sure that there are people who was blaming the referee but nobody expected that that if even if it was a foul at the restart nobody expected something different to happen you know anyway so
SPEAKER_01: We will see. We will see how it will be. And then there will be also next month. I think next month's East versus West event will be very, very good as well. You know, Revas Lutizze will be pulling Vitaly Laletin. Looks like Vitaly Laletin healed up his arms. You know, like he feels healthy.
SPEAKER_01: Um, and Ravaz was super dominant against Dave Chaffee. He beat Dave Chaffee easier than anyone in his career, as far as I see. And like, how do you guys see this match, Ravaz and Laletin? I think Ravaz is going to beat him. I think that guy's only getting stronger and I think his peak is higher than, uh,
SPEAKER_02: Then, uh, I can't even pronounce his name, but I think his, his, his, yeah, his, his trajectory right now is like this where, uh, he's like this, you know what I mean? Okay. So you are saying that has reached his potential limits while Ray was still improving. I think so. I mean, we could be proved wrong. You know, he could have come back from that match with, uh, Dave and gotten even stronger.
SPEAKER_02: But oftentimes that's not the case. Oftentimes it's the case of like Dave Chafee right now, who's been, in my opinion, just slowly putting it off, like taking time off that he needs. And it's starting to show. And now he's forced to take time off. I think that's what happened with. Yeah, but I think it revolves. Didn't he? He quit for a long time, didn't he? And then come back.
SPEAKER_02: same guy yeah see and then he's just we've seen him slowly get better and he's a giant he's a giant human being so yeah i think he wins that one pretty convincingly unless he just doesn't know how to arm wrestle that style which can be a factor if you don't know how to deal with that style it's very difficult so yeah i got him winning unless unless uh vitality pulls something out of his
SPEAKER_02: His hat, I see him losing 3-0. And how do you see Tom's? I don't know about that much. I don't follow that hard, you know. Tom, you got a beautiful man behind you right there. I don't know if you've noticed, but he's quite handsome. Yeah, I do. No.
SPEAKER_01: anyway so i don't know beautiful days are waiting uh for us and arm wrestling is getting into higher levels as a sport and hopefully it will not stop here it will just grow more and more and then we all will get
SPEAKER_01: respect as much as we always deserve. Anyway, so guys, I thank you very much. Before we finish, do you have anything to say to each other? And any message that in less than two weeks I will be seeing you guys? And yeah, anything you want to add before we finish? Justin, what's going to be your move?
SPEAKER_02: Outside or inside, what do you think? What's your plan? I'm going to flop that hand back for you. I'm going to flop it back so hard and so fast that you're going to be wondering what just actually happened. And then you're going to ask your coach and he's going to be like, I don't really know what happened, but you lost. And that's, you know, that's round one. Round two, I don't know. Depends on if you're actually strong or not. If you're actually strong,
SPEAKER_02: I might stay outside. I don't know. Yeah, I don't really come to the table with a plan. I kind of let you give me the plan. You know what I mean? Because I'm well-rounded. Okay, okay. I like it. Yeah. Just get your elbow healed up real good. You got like 14 days or something like that. I want it to be fresh. I don't want no excuses.
SPEAKER_01: There is no excuse. When you come to the East versus West, you either win or lose. There is no excuse. If there is excuse, you don't accept the match. And if you accept it, there is no excuse. But Thomas, I didn't see you super confident. I hope I am wrong, my friends. Why you would ask him if he's going to go outside or inside my plane? Because he's worried. He's worried. He's worried about you?
SPEAKER_02: No, that's bullshit. You better be. Hey, if you ain't thinking about me right now, come the 29th, you're going to be thinking about me all night. So, do it now. Sorry, I didn't get what you mean. I said, if you're not thinking about me right now, you will be thinking about me. Come on.
SPEAKER_02: come the 29th. When you're sitting in your room thinking about that ale you just took. Yeah, and then after three pints, I will forget about you. Nah, people don't forget about me. I talk too much trash for that. Okay. I'll buy you a beer, though. Save something for the press conference. Yes.
