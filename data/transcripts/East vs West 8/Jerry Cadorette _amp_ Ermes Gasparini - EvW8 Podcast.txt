SPEAKER_02: You guys hear me well? So how is everyone? How is life going?
SPEAKER_02: Where should I go? Okay. Sitting here. Make a mistake.
SPEAKER_00: Guys, please be patient. Very soon they will join.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, very soon they are coming.
SPEAKER_00: Vitaly to be deserved, of course, Vitaly deserved it, but just, I mean, if you have a bicep tear, you don't try to pull in like four months, you know. Of course, Vitaly won fair, square, he deserved 100%, but I mean, you need a little bit, you know, time.
SPEAKER_00: It was mistake, I think. I'm not saying that result would be different or same or something. I just say that I think he needed a little bit more time.
SPEAKER_00: Hello to Tahran and hello to Naveed. I just trained today. I feel motivated. I feel good. I am even tempted to pull earlier than what I planned, but I didn't train so heavy. I'm still afraid of here.
SPEAKER_00: I train with bicep, but not so heavy. We will see.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, my friends. Thank you, Drew. Thank you. Today I was thinking, today I was watching Paul Italia and Jerry together, and then Paul was saying to Jerry, you know, Jerry, why are we, you know, behind the world, you know, North America, what should we do, and this and that. And I really hoped that it was a good point, but I really hoped that
SPEAKER_00: People will realize that my intention to bring East and West is also serving to grow the level of North American armistice. Teşekkürler Cem kardeşim.
SPEAKER_00: like, because, I mean, nobody is made of iron or something, you know, the only thing, only thing that only thing that is helping
SPEAKER_00: um the competition at the same time i'm telling her message with zoom or youtube or something sorry guys um do you guys realize that what makes the east as of now a little bit better is because of the competition level the kazakh russia georgia bulgaria these that they are all the time
SPEAKER_00: Competing is not a new thing. Last 20 years, every year, Europeans, walls, Zloty, Europeans, walls, Zloty, all the time. So what we need to realize that North American armwrestling did not
SPEAKER_00: get involved with the really top level of competition. So what I try to do by involving the best of US to this level of competition, in fact, even those haters, probably they are jealous of what I am doing. All the time, like Engin wants Americans to lose or something. That's totally the opposite way that, you know, I'm trying to support North American arm wrestling to
SPEAKER_00: catch up with world level armwrestling.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, we are still waiting for them to come.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, very soon they are coming. What time is it? Five minutes, they have five minutes.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, I'm trying to do something. I'm very sorry about that.
SPEAKER_02: okay let's go now i can follow the chat sorry about it
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Michael workspace. It's very fair. You know, whoever comes first, get the world title. Yeah. Thank you, Barbara. Yeah, yeah. As soon as I'm ready, I will compete, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I understand my friend, but we need to somehow do you realize your mama do you realize that 30 years ago Americans were the best in the world. um.
SPEAKER_00: Or was Italy a future possible match? It's set already, Galaxo, on August 24th. August 24th will be probably the best ever East versus West. Okay, now. Hello.
SPEAKER_00: Francis, Canada, you mean, Canada? Hello to Canada. Hello, hello, hello, Hermes. How are you? Hello, Engin. Hello, Engin. Engin. Thank you. Same time, huh? Oh, yeah. You will see me from America.
SPEAKER_00: You hear us Jerry? Yeah, can you see me? Yeah, did you see what did you? Did you hear what he just said? No, what do you say that he's crying? He said he's gonna directly three match in a row. He's gonna get this shoulder pressure to you. Yeah. Yep, probably. No, I didn't say that.
SPEAKER_00: so it has been a long time you two just going back and forth back and forth back and forth on social media and last time i remember you were showing that like your fat percentage was less than hermes's i remember and that and then you got the shoulder injury and then you couldn't compete and then it was gonna be set for the may and then he had
SPEAKER_00: some shoulder issues against Levan. And now finally, finally, today, I made a poll. And I just asked people, if one of these guys, because they bought one time postponed the match because of the shoulder injury. Let's see what people said. And I said, Should I give the title directly? 3200 was says yes, give the title to the one
SPEAKER_00: who shows up and then the other 23% says no, just postpone again. So do you guys agree if one of you cannot be professional enough and get injured and then the other one get the title? I'm gonna get injured between now and four weeks? Yeah. Yeah, that would have to be, that would be a pussy.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, the one who says I am injured, you know, and I cannot come, you'll be pushing, right? Yeah, exactly. Okay. A giant, giant vagina. I'm going to send Ermi some badges so he can, you know, fix his vagina. Yeah. Do you, do you know the, do you know the way he calls you when he says like Kagoret? You know what it means?
SPEAKER_00: no it means something bad and i think you need to punish him at the table and teach him how to talk with older people you know yeah yeah i'll teach him is there a child abuse law in turkey because when i beat him real bad i don't want the police to come and take me away
SPEAKER_00: I mean, there is such law, but I'm sure that they will ignore it this time because Hermes has been so disrespectful. So when you beat Hermes, and then the police will say, oh, we didn't see anything. Yeah, okay, all right, good, good. I don't understand, sorry. He says that you are a child, and whenever he will beat you,
SPEAKER_01: like he doesn't want police to come and, you know, take him to the jail because you are a kid, you know, that's what he says. Maybe there are the opposite. He means you're too old and too safe for himself. Yeah. No, it would be funnier if you said like that you were beating up a senior citizen because, you know, I'm over 50, so. Over? Yeah, 50 years old.
SPEAKER_00: 20 years old difference. Yeah. How old your parents? My? Yeah. Your father, how old is he? 63. Oh, okay. His father was a good arm master as well. No, that's good. Italian champion. Yeah. Many, many years when we go to the WAP championships, his father was also representing Italy. Oh, really?
SPEAKER_01: Big hands, super genetic. And now his son is just... My sister have a lot genetic, but he don't want, she don't want to train. Yeah. You show my last video. Thank you. You mean the 92 kilo lifting? No, Ma. After this, they recording my sister.
SPEAKER_00: oh okay i didn't no you didn't know so yeah do you realize that he win a wish uh bob with the guys like yeah yeah wow wow okay jerry you know how to use the light the best in the in the community you know like taking right from the top your shoulder you know getting all that that that
SPEAKER_00: shallow underneath you know and then looks oh yeah don't do that jerry jerry jerry what did we talk before the before the before the podcast we said you were not gonna show everything those muscles everything i said yeah but what to do hermes is gonna now tomorrow say he injured himself and he's gonna cancel the match
SPEAKER_01: he used the light for to to to be more bigger you understand like a body builder but this is don't we change nothing on the table do you understand what you understand what he says right yeah that it's going to be the same results on the table i agree
SPEAKER_01: it says that it is okay and he can't help you my friend paul italia and you can screaming everybody but nobody can help you this time it's okay when you will start to to to screaming you are already losing
SPEAKER_00: okay you okay did you just say that whenever he pulls if he says angie yeah yeah no no he he came when they will start to to to to to say engine he will already lose oh he will not even have a time to do that no time okay okay gb19 says that jerry your drink is not quality my friends
SPEAKER_01: Nope. Ice coffee. What is it, this drink? Ice coffee. Coffee, huh? Ice coffee. Yeah. My friend, are you ready or not? I don't understand for our match. Ready for what? To beat your ass? Yeah, yeah. Are you ready?
SPEAKER_03: All right, buddy, I'm ready. The sad thing is we still got four weeks. Four weeks, yeah. Four weeks to get big. When do we leave? When do we come? Me? Yeah. I fly out on Tuesday. When is the URI, right?
SPEAKER_03: yeah I arrived on Wednesday I fly out my time late Tuesday night and I arrived like Wednesday night because it's like 10 and a half hour flight SG Records says Paul Italia is Jerry but cigarettes I don't know what that means but
SPEAKER_00: anyway so but i jerry do you think it is fair that he is only 125 kilo while you are probably more than 150 kilo what's your weight now 330 326. okay so do you think it's fair no i'll try to i'll try to cut some weight before i get there okay do you think that he is too small for you
SPEAKER_03: Well, we know he's too small, but you know, that's going to be his thing. Oh, that was too light. That was too small. My vagina was hurt. You will see the poor quality, my friend. The old quality. Quality vagina? Quality. Masculine.
SPEAKER_01: When you will see me in Istanbul, you will mind we go crazy, we don't understand nothing. Really. Wait, wait, another four weeks and we will see. I'm seeing you right now and I'm not like overly impressed. But in the... Does the camera take off about 30 pounds? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: okay because then maybe it'll make sense when i see you in person you see but but i will tell you something jerry you look to me the biggest ever trust me it's no joke i'm strong i don't know you look you look very big yeah and i mean hermes you better do the right homework
SPEAKER_00: Any mistake wouldn't work. You did, right? Yeah. Yeah, because if any mistake, then it will not result good and it will not be possible to change anything. This guy will not pull you again. He's already 50 years old. You will not have any match to get your revenge or something. The guy is coming there to beat you.
SPEAKER_00: A little mistake will not result good. You'll be terrible. But you said like this, I'm ready for this match. I'm not saying you are not. I'm not saying that. This is exactly the same thing I'm saying. You better be ready. If you are ready, everything is good. But just sometimes we do calculations. With this technique, it's impossible to beat me. Impossible.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what he wants to do. Maybe he will go in the top row, in the hook. But with this technique... You know, I will tell you something. His technique... Your finger will be longer, five, ten centimeters more. I will open your wrist. Yeah, I think his technique works the best against the top rowers. That's how he is known, you know. But not with me.
SPEAKER_01: Are you going to try to top roll him or you have different plans? I will do a flop wrist press like him. You will beat him with a flop wrist? Yeah. Right from the beginning or just to finish? We will see. The first match I will test his power. The top roll, the hook, we will see who is the strongest. After this, we can
SPEAKER_01: To do a good show for the fans. So first match you're going to test my power and go right into a hook with me? That sounds good. I hold you like this. You can do nothing. Okay. You don't recognize... Maybe you don't understand the situation, but in the four weeks we will understand everything.
SPEAKER_00: There is some chat in the chat room here. Guys, do not confuse supermatch with the tournament. Tournament, you may have a tougher draw than supermatch. Tournament is different. Supermatch is different. The idiot is right in there that, you know, Samusha didn't take top three, you know. How about when Zurab won the last time, you know? Did you write there that the East versus West, probably fifth place in the ranking, won the 95? No, just...
SPEAKER_00: Just please keep it away. The tournament is already finished or not? What's that? The tournament is already finished or not? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so what I just tried to say, this match is for the number one and most likely the winner of this match is going to face Levan. And
SPEAKER_00: How do you, how do you, when you say that Hermes, like you're going to crash him, he will need hospital or you will break everything with him or something. Is it like a psychological intimidation or is it like you really believe that you will really dominate him? Me? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's impossible. For him, I'm sorry, but for him, it's impossible.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe, maybe with some, uh, with the endurance, but now with this weight, my endurance is more than before. The power is more than before. Yeah. The, the possibility to win is 99%. It's only 1%. Maybe, you know, you are sick or maybe, but if I'm a good shape on the table, the 29th of July,
SPEAKER_00: no chance only one percent the same as last time you said you remember yeah yeah now maybe now more why yeah yeah because my powers grow up every month okay when you say like more you mean that the one percent will be even less yeah oh okay okay okay hey jerry you don't say anything to hermes
SPEAKER_01: That's because it's comical to hear him talk. It's like he opens his mouth and just diarrhea comes out. It doesn't make sense. His numbers, they must be Italian numbers because they're all fucked. And we cut your, with the scissors, your, I don't know the name. Lip? Or tongue? Lip, I will cut. Tongue, tongue, tongue. Your power, you go down and you push nothing anymore.
SPEAKER_00: Hermes, do you need his power to go down to beat him? He's Lee? No, this one. This is tongue. Yeah, his power started from here. Okay, okay. But what I'm just saying that if you don't cut his tongue, you are afraid of his power? Immediately. No, but you are afraid of his power? If you don't cut, he's going to beat you? Oh, no. Okay, why do you need to cut? Okay, okay, okay. I understand, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Jerry, do you think that his style is going to work against you? Because before you pulled Gennady, night before, I was talking with John, we were having dinner, and John said that you're going to beat Gennady.
SPEAKER_00: And I said, like, are you serious? And he said, yeah. Especially if Gennady tries top row, just watch. You will see. And the next day, you cause big problems, you know. So do you think that Hermes has a chance to beat you with his top row, or he needs to try something else, like Devon tried at the WAL with the, you know... I think...
SPEAKER_03: Uh, I'm stronger than I was against Gennady. And, um, I think that it's going to be a good match, but I don't think, uh, the only person that would win fast would be me. I don't think he can win fast. Um, and, uh, I think that he's definitely going to try, you know,
SPEAKER_03: he's obviously got strong back pressure but you gotta remember what he did in back pressure is almost the exact same weight that i did as a one-armed table curl for four reps right and so it's not gonna be that i'm weak and uh so i don't know why he's delusional and thinks that it's gonna be easy for him but that's okay i'd rather him come in thinking it's gonna be easy because
SPEAKER_03: know i'm going to be strong and i'm not slow so and i've gone against a million top rollers right i think when travis was was in his prime and i beat him in 0607 um i think he was the most explosive person on go more explosive than ermys more explosive than anyone really
SPEAKER_03: and uh so i've historically gone against top rollers my entire life i've been competing longer than he's been alive so we'll see you can't you can't compare uh travis badge in the past and now no when travis in 0607 he beat everyone you can't you can't compare this labor says you yes says you he was number one in the world
SPEAKER_00: He beat Alexi Vovoda. He beat everyone that was good in that time. Denis Saplenkov. He beat them all. So we'll see. I don't think that Travis ever beat Denis Saplenkov. He beat Alexi in 2003, but he was around 2006. He was like one of the best for sure. Those years, 2006, I think he was, or 2005, he was up there, you know. I think John was still the best 2006, but...
SPEAKER_00: And do you think that, Jerry, do you think that Hermes is underestimating you because he has never pulled someone like you? Yeah, of course. Do you think that he will experience something that he, like, do you think he is confident because he really never met someone like you?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, it's obvious, right? He's never gone against anyone that's like me. There's no one like me, right? There's people that try the press and try to do it at that level, but I'd argue that no one can do it like I do it, right? And I think that people, they know someone that does a press and then they train with them and then they think that they're good because they beat someone that's mediocre at best at the press.
SPEAKER_03: And then they think they've got it all figured out. Right. But I'm ready to go inside or into a press either way. Right. And if he goes into a top row, I'm OK if I give up my wrist so he can say my wrist is weak. My wrist is whatever will be attached by a pair of straps that are going to break. And then he's not going through.
SPEAKER_03: when i can table curl and i can do tricep you know presses with countless weight way more than he can do right so he can't do more weight than me so him thinking that he's going to be able to pull through and beat that it's it's okay let him think that yeah but i want to go into the match confident i want him to go into the match confident no one should show up in turkey and be be unsure if they're gonna win
SPEAKER_03: So I like his confidence and I actually like earnings, right? So he knows that and I think everyone in the world knows it because when they were speaking negative of him, I was speaking positive of him. I like what he brings to the sport.
SPEAKER_03: I just I'm anxious to get the match underway and see what happens because, you know, everyone wants to be the best. You got to beat the best. And, you know, in order for him to do it, let's see him do it on the table. Right. Saying it and doing it are two different things.
SPEAKER_00: But I have a question. If Hermes was only back pressure and pronator base top roller, then I would just say that he is in trouble, big trouble. He may still be, I don't know. But do you think that him to have a super transition to shoulder pressure and like very fast he does, and then he's very effective once he puts his shoulder behind, does it worry you that, you know,
SPEAKER_00: like he may he may get behind his hand and then like take you to the this side of the center and quickly do this like do you think that that that may be a problem for you well i mean i get that he's going to be able to uh that he's gone in the past and done that where he's been able to transition but
SPEAKER_03: Bingen, I've gone against these people my entire life, right? I know when someone's moving. I know when they're transitioning because someone's going to, when they top roll and they're going to pull back. Yeah. Here, you know, they're going to have this separation. As soon as they start to move, you have to move. So you got to be able to. Okay. Once he comes back to put his shoulder, then you hit him and bring him more down.
SPEAKER_00: so you are saying that he needs to keep his shoulder this away to keep this angle once he brings it and then you hit him then that angle will be going okay i understand so once he moves his shoulder you're gonna hit him to open his arm down you know right you gotta be offense and defense so being able to maneuver from offense and defense is great but
SPEAKER_03: I think that I've seen it. I've done it. It's been there, right? So we'll see come the 29th. Can you say that this is the strongest jetty we have ever seen?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, this is a very strong Jerry, right? There's no doubt that I am at or above wherever I've ever been, right? So I'm working on endurance because strength wise, I'm really strong, right? And so it's just a matter of
SPEAKER_03: Maybe the next, you know, we got what, four weeks. So at least the next three weeks, I got to work a little bit more on cardio. So, uh, riding my bike, doing the treadmill, shit like that. So, um, I'm, I'm always good for a long match, but you know, I get a little winded after the match and I want to make sure I limit the amount of, um, you know, how I get winded. Okay. I still give you a key.
SPEAKER_00: Hermes is going to make fresh spaghetti with jerry sand and sprinkle chalk over them like pasta flour. Pasta di Gasparini al dente. I don't know what that means. You know when you put the pasta in the water to cook the pasta? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Al dente is when there is not too much food. It's a little bit harder to eat. Okay, a few questions. One of them is, are you intimidated when you see Jerry like this? Not at all.
SPEAKER_01: in front of me. Levan. You know Levan? Who is he? Is that the guy from Congo? Yeah, Congo. And Bruce is super big. Yes, I saw him when he fought with Gennady. He's very big, Jerry. Uh-huh.
SPEAKER_00: But you know, there are no bodybuilding here that is different from... Baba, can we compare like directly Jerry with Levan? The reason I'm asking, I'm not saying that Jerry is stronger than Levan or something. I'm not saying, who knows. But do you think that the difference that they are like attacking to different directions?
SPEAKER_00: And we know that Jerry, where he attacks is like, he's the number one, what he's doing. And now when you see him in such a shape, it just, to me, it just means that he is gonna put pressure more than usual. So that is why I'm saying he is already dangerous with his style because it is not so much common. You know, you don't see someone like Jerry around.
SPEAKER_01: And whenever you see him in incredible shape, then does it worry you? Or when you say that you are confident you're going to do that, are you really confident? Every time when we go for a Supermatch, I'm a little bit worried. It's normal, I think. Because if you are too much confident or too, you know,
SPEAKER_01: is not good for yourself. I had a big lesson about this and now every time I will go, I want to give my 100% my best for if I will lose, if I don't have any excuse.
SPEAKER_01: see when you say like if i lose jerry at that point you wanted to correct him yeah he means when yeah you shouldn't say if you lose you should say of course the style of jerry is i don't know because it's very difficult to to say
SPEAKER_01: where is the power of him but i study a lot about this i show many videos about him and his opponent if a georgie in this position he use a little bit his press he he he won the match he got
SPEAKER_01: now so for sure jerry is more stronger when i thought georgie and of course i think but i think the difference of power of me and the georgie between me and georgie is now five percent of them i understand there is a super jet karaoke week jerry said he would be anyway air mass put up
SPEAKER_00: is he going to be the 92 kg back pressure hermes just posted thank you for your support to me yeah they're asking you like are you gonna beat uh i don't want you to hurt yourself please don't worry please don't try don't try this weight
SPEAKER_01: don't want me to try it because you don't 50 kilo is enough 50 maximum 60 kilo for you now irma's afraid that i try it when i do it then he can't try and beat it maybe maybe he he he will put a fake weight my friend hanging yeah hanging he will put a fake weight do you think he would do such things
SPEAKER_00: No, he will put a fake weight. But do you think that he would try to do such things? Yeah, with the fake weight, yes. It's funny. I put mine on the scale. Yeah, this is important. And then you think that he may use the fake scale? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, Silky Milky, super chat. I think if Hermes can take Jerry past center, he will have the power to finish Jerry by press easy. Hermes, are you good in hook if you do not get Jerry past center?
SPEAKER_00: They're asking you, he says that if you pass the center, he thinks that you're going to beat Jerry. But if you cannot pass the center, are you good in hook? They are asking you. Maybe if you do think about this. Of course, I will go the winning position. Of course.
SPEAKER_00: impossible to not go on the winning position okay the question is jerry i know hermes are you planning to win this match like quick or you think that there is a possibility this match to be a battle
SPEAKER_00: Like it may become a game of endurance or you are thinking like 100% you're going to just like destroy him. What are you planning? Jerry or me? You, you, you, you. Me. Yeah. I don't think that Jerry is going to flash pin you.
SPEAKER_00: I think that you will, I mean, even if you would lose the match, you will stop him here. The question, if you stop him here, can you recover or not? But your chance is, like, if it is a battle of endurance and if you are caught here, then it is very dangerous for you. But do you, like, do you think, are you ready for a battle as well? Or you are only focused on just to destroy him quickly and 3-0 and go home, you know? Yeah, these are my planings.
SPEAKER_01: So does it mean that you are not ready for a battle? Yeah, yeah. But we know his style is better to play with endurance than me. I know. With Lewandowski, when I was in this position,
SPEAKER_01: I don't fade. You know when you pull very strong and you fade, your mask goes down. In this position you can pull more than with normal technique. We will see. I will do my best to finish the matching.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe three, four seconds. We don't know. Five seconds. Okay, so you are saying that each round you want to finish the match within five seconds? Yeah. Yeah. Or one. Why are you loud, Giardini? Why?
SPEAKER_01: You must be. I mean, Engin might want to call paramedics. I think he hit his head. Oh. So he thinks that you hit your head somewhere. You know, that's why you are just saying this nonsense thing. This is what you say. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Your hand will be longer than before. For sure. Very good catching for you.
SPEAKER_01: You know when you do a stretch, it will be very, very good stretching for the finger, for the wrist, for your forearm. I will not broke your tendon, but it will be good stretching after a workout. Hermes, how much can you stretch someone in the strap, his fingers?
SPEAKER_00: How? How much can you stretch the fingers in the step? Whatever you want, no problem. In the step, you can go part of his fingers in the step? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. And Jerry, are you intimidated by his confidence? No. No? It's like...
SPEAKER_00: I have little kids, Engen, right? I got five kids, right? This is like talking to one of my kids. They're delusional. Oh. But Jenny, are you right now, like, how much, like, yourself? Like, are you just trying to intimidate me? Or, like, you look very confident right now. Are you as confident as you show us? Engen.
SPEAKER_03: I wouldn't get on a plane to fucking fly 10 and a half hours if I wasn't, you know, confident. I know, listen, I posted videos to show that my strength is going up. Each week it goes up. There's no doubt that I'm much stronger than when I went against Gennady. When I went against Georgie, I didn't lift at all. Zero lifting, right? Because I was recovering from my shoulder injury.
SPEAKER_03: so now i'm lifting strong going to go over there and then i got to teach a lesson to the you know this this little child i wait i wait that we wait like jerry is he gonna feel like you know a building collapsing on his arm once you put your shoulder
SPEAKER_03: i think and i'm positive he's never gone against someone like me so when he goes against me everything that he thought is going to be different right everything he thought is going to be different he's going to be oh i wasn't prepared for that oh i didn't know it was going to feel like that oh you know everything that would just change his name to oh you do my friend you never you never like me with my style
SPEAKER_01: I've pulled everyone at their best. I pulled John at his best and beat him. I pulled Travis at his best, beat him. He won't join with you. What? John, he beat you like this. John A has never beaten you. When with a blue t-shirt I showed. John, he beat you like this in the hoop.
SPEAKER_00: Jeff, he beat you in the hook, like the easy. John, he beat you like the easy in 0.5 seconds. Talking about, I think, Mohegan Sun. I think both Ron and John won against you. That's what he's talking about. Oh, Mohegan Sun? I think it was Mohegan Sun, if I misremember. He's talking about blue shirt. I just received a... Blue shirt, blue t-shirt.
SPEAKER_00: yeah okay maybe 20 years hi hermes you just sent me a message i think i injured myself i won't be able to make it
SPEAKER_00: what no why are you dead easily openly right why do i say i should i should have read after they went right because you are just sitting how can people believe that yeah sorry sorry sorry bad timing
SPEAKER_01: i need to to have another idea for next week another idea sorry sorry about that maybe a bench press without the weight like he's like without the luck oh i injured myself yeah right i put collars on poison i put the i bought the little collars for the end so show me the weight show show me the weight the number
SPEAKER_00: Sam, those are three 45 pounds. Three of them, two 70, both sides together to 70 and the bar 45 or 315 pounds. Yes. Yeah. Um, there is a super chat under us. Is Hermes ready to face Jerry inside? That's what they are asking. Me too.
SPEAKER_00: No, they're asking if Jerry ready or not. You said Hermes. Hermes or Jerry? No, they're asking if Hermes is ready to go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen, listen. Engen, Engen, see how mushy those arms are? What's that? How mushy?
SPEAKER_01: They look like a marshmallow. Yeah, but when I pull like a steel, you will touch. You will touch my bicep, you will feel everything. I feel the mushy? I saw you pushing it, it looked like a deflated tire. I know, he knew very well. When the mask was like a steel.
SPEAKER_00: You saw that, right? So, marshmallow, huh? Yeah. He was just like going as usual and then he just suddenly got hurt, you know. In practice?
SPEAKER_00: no in the competition oh yeah yeah how many how many more you need to recovery from i don't know it looks very clean clean break very clean yeah i don't know we will see whether soon we will see and and i think the latin won the heavyweight that's interesting yeah just dave chaffee beat him
SPEAKER_01: then now laletin won there and then they cheffy has lost again cheffy is not same like one year ago yeah but even one year ago before the other day when he pulled it with gennady more or me or i understand but even but even those times they lost against gennady and morozov before he beat the first match he won easy
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah. But what I'm just saying is that... Yeah. Ran out of gas too quick. Who? I said Dave ran out of gas when he went against... He didn't run out of gas against Lallatin. He won't. No, I didn't say that. He was saying that when he went against Gennady and Artem. I understand. But what I'm just saying that if he didn't run
SPEAKER_00: out of gas against Laletin, but if he ran out of gas against Gennady Morozov, so it means that those guys had what it needed while Laletin didn't have. This is what I'm saying. And Laletin is going to pull now against Revas. What do you think? Who? Laletin and Revas in August. They are going to pull against each other. 2.5.
SPEAKER_01: It will be amazing, but if you put the technique of the style, I think Reva is the favorite. Because of the wrist positioning? Yeah, only for this. But we don't know, maybe...
SPEAKER_01: I think Lallestine's back pressure is very strong here. Maybe he will open... He will open the wrist of Revas. But it's a very interesting match. Super. Because now he won with... I saw he won with... Lallestine. He won in the tournament. He won with...
SPEAKER_00: The Russian guy. The name. Zaur? Zaur. Zaur. Yeah. What I saw is that Slayev beat Zaur first and then Vitaly beat Slayev. And then I didn't see the rest of the matches. Probably Slayev lost against Zaur. And in the final, I saw Laletin beat Zaur. I think Zaur just came back too quick after his bicep injury. I think too. I think too. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Alain Zoller didn't want 85 kilo, Alain Zoller want 75 kilo. I don't know, people just comes here and just writes whatever. I mean, it comes to their mind if it's true or not, you know, just. Anyway, so. Okay, so what you guys are saying basically, basically that like, and also you, Jerry, like, do you, you don't see, you don't see any danger Hermes to be so too explosive and then
SPEAKER_03: when you are confident that it is gonna be a match that will stop somewhere no obviously he's good i never said he wasn't good i said that uh i just have to be ready for him right so if i make a mistake then obviously he's gonna win but i have to just go and be exactly how i need to be without making a mistake
SPEAKER_03: If I make a mistake and I let him on the other side and I get my arm on the other side of my shoulder, then it's going to be a bad day for me. But I need to be right in my lane and make it a bad day for him. Yeah, I understand. You don't call it 85 kilo category. You call that up to 85 kilo open category. You know, just that is the difference here. Anyway, so let's see.
SPEAKER_00: And so let's talk about some other matches. What do you guys think about Gennady versus Morozov? Zaur didn't destroy Slayer. The first match they met, Slayer beat Zaur. Maybe the second time when they beat, he beat everyone, including Slayer maybe. Okay, what were you saying, Hermes?
SPEAKER_00: I think it's 50-50. 50-50 match? How do you see them winning? Do you see Morozov top-rolling Gennady? Or do you see Morozov beating Gennady inside? How do you see the match? It's too difficult to say.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think Morozov will go in the hook with Gennady. Because Gennady has a lot of endurance. Morozov too, but I think Gennady a little more. For sure he will go in the top row. We will see if he can use the pressure. He has enough power to go in the winning position.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. It's very interesting, this fight. Because Gennady can use five techniques, it's incredible. He's an incredible fighter, he's super. And Jerry, how do you see this match, Morozov versus Gennady?
SPEAKER_03: I'm a big Gennady fan, and I think he's going to be the more technical arm wrestler. I think Morozov is...
SPEAKER_03: young and super strong and i think he's going to have a great future in the sport i like the future that you know i see morozov and i see ermys you know uh dominating for a lot of years and uh i think it'll uh it'll be interesting because as
SPEAKER_03: they they progress and they become better technical arm wrestlers and their their ceiling is really high right so take the sport is going to be awesome places i think right so i think um uh gnadi's gonna have a challenge going against that much power from artem so i think he's gonna be able to take away his power
SPEAKER_03: And Gennady's a smart enough arm wrestler to do it. And he's got great endurance. It's just a matter of he's going to have to get inside with Artem and pull him to his side of the table to open him up. I understand. And another one I want to ask quickly. Paulo versus Andres.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. Pablo. I think Sandri is a little bit favorite. He will go on the top with Pablo. Okay. Because he's a little bit weak, Pablo, here.
SPEAKER_00: He fought with John Brezinko, or am I wrong? It's correct. He fought with John Pablo one year ago. Who? Pablo? Yes, yes. Round one he took him down here to stop him and bring it back and won. And then I think one round they went to hook and then... Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I put 60-40 to Sandris. For Sandris? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And Jerry, you have any idea about this match? This is best of five. It cannot be 4-3. I think that Saunders has the longer arm. And I think he's going to have to try to come back, open him up quick. Pavlo's been...
SPEAKER_03: uh getting better quick right he's in obviously he's um we're the West right the United States is West right yeah so I got a route for the West but I like I like Sandra's uh you know as a person and uh I think he's uh also a real dominant you always easy with you I saw what Sandra is he be he beat you
SPEAKER_01: Beat me? Beat me off? Yeah, he won with you after... Shut up! Yeah, my friend! Yeah, I know. I beat him the first couple of matches. I was already drunk. And Engie, he took your shield and gave it to Sandridge. Remember, Engie? No?
SPEAKER_03: no he's stupid after the match with the gennady you remember it was engen was right there right i shouldn't be going on the table right but i was already uh about five six drinks in because i was at the bar and then we were just around and then i pulled him over a couple
SPEAKER_03: i pulled him over the first couple times and then i let him get on my hand and that was a mistake right when i let him get on my hand and with all
SPEAKER_00: That was, that was, that was, that was the alcohol talk. Every time is a mistake, Engin. Why? He continues to do it. Come on, Hermes. I don't want to say anything. I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to say anything. But Hermes, Hermes, Hermes, this guy just had five, five, five, five rounds match with Gennady. Five rounds match with Gennady while Sandris comfortably beat Lachlan.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, no, my friend. What no? What no? They took a very long battle between Sandri. Lockton and Sandri? Yeah. Listen, I will start to question your arm-wrestling knowledge. He pulled it between me and Sandri before Jerry, after me. I understand, but do you think that any of these can be equal to five rounds match with Gennady? Huh?
SPEAKER_00: Do you think that this, what you just say is as hard as having five rounds match of Gennady? Because I remember after round four, last two rounds, you were just holding your arm when you pulled Gennady. So I'm just saying it's not that easy to pull many rounds with Gennady. I pulled only three weeks after Kurveka. I understand, but what I'm just saying that... What does that have to do with anything?
SPEAKER_01: Look at the quality, my friend. Quality? I see. He came to speak nothing after this. Yeah, that's called. Yeah. After the bicep post, I think there's no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
SPEAKER_00: Amazing. Hermes, if I would judge by the look... This is not pampered, eh? This is not pampered. Normal. Yeah, we can tell. We can tell. Okay. Thank you for your suggestion. If Morozov is able to finish Gennady with ease,
SPEAKER_00: Does he get to pull Hermes soon? Who knows? Anything is possible, but we need to go like slowly. And Wagon Green, Jerry, can you do 10 reps with three plays on camera right now? No, no, no, no, no, no. Better not. I decide for you, Jerry. It's better not. Don't hurt yourself. Don't have any pain, any excuse for our man.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. How many times you train a week? What? For which body part? I do. I work out three, three days lifting one day. I'm wrestling. Only bench, free time, bench press. No, no, no, no. Eventually once a week, each, each body part once a week. And then, uh, then I arm wrestle once a week for about two to three hours.
SPEAKER_01: Me too. Four or five. And the cardio, nothing. Yeah, not enough cardio. I'm going to work on my cardio for the next three weeks so I can be ready for you. It's not, it's not, it's not enough for only three weeks. Or not, Engie, for good cardio. Engie. What's that?
SPEAKER_00: He told that he wanted to train the cardio only three weeks. Three weeks is nothing. Four. Four weeks. Four weeks. Yeah. I started to . Hermes, I cannot question someone's experience like when he has been pulling minimum last 35 years.
SPEAKER_01: so i cannot say it's enough for him or not enough for him i i don't know i know i i i would you would like me to support you against jerry oh no i know i don't need this support my friend yeah okay but but for me for me like a runner or another sport with a lot of endurance you need to to
SPEAKER_01: to have forever to have a good cardio you need to train for not only for three weeks there's nothing i think yeah i don't know by the look i look at i look at the screen and then by pc and then he looks more dangerous than you you look nervous now my friend you know you know i know what do you mean inside
SPEAKER_01: what's that yeah i can go to the cabinet grab some marshmallows too
SPEAKER_00: too funny anyway so petrenko versus chen show right right arm yeah ah
SPEAKER_00: Wow. Engen, you're making Ermias use his toughest muscle. It's his brain. Huh? What? He is just making fun with your brain because you answer so late. Because, my friend, I don't speak like you. You don't have to speak. He just asks you who you can speak with.
SPEAKER_01: with the good quality quality yes not like you you speak because you open your mouth where the words go going up yeah words come out when i open my mouth when you open your mouth it's uh it's not a doctor's office they're not going to stick a thing in your mouth you just got to use words no no no 55 petrenko oh 55 percent and what do you think chance
SPEAKER_01: Chance, 45. No, no, no, no. What I'm asking, what do you think about... Okay, Jerry, what's your opinion? I'll go the opposite. I'll do 55% chance. Oh, 55% chance. Okay, okay. So, at least this one... What do you think about my new record of back pressure? You show the video or not? Me? Yeah, I saw it. Yeah, yeah. Not bad.
SPEAKER_01: I did that. Easy weight. But I did the same weight as a one-arm curl. No, no, no. This weight is not good for a man. What? My one-arm curl was real. You need to put your elbow with the bench. You understand? Like this. My elbow...
SPEAKER_03: the table you can't use your mask or very good what it's not good lift with your on the table no matter what words you want to say i did the same weight with the one arm dumbbell curl for four reps this way four you struggled to do it for one
SPEAKER_00: okay jiren mopa hello engine for the signing card is it possible to use a lot of pencils so the pencil doesn't run out quickly for the rest of the cars so the signatures to be always clear my friend on the table maybe you can see on the videos there are like 50 pencils you know as long as the athletes do their job good there are plenty of even more than uh enough you know uh pencils
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so I asked about Morozov versus Gennady. As of now, 149 votes, 67% Morozov, 33% Gennady. Gennady is always, always underdog. He just somehow ends up winning, but the guy is just... Gennady is very dangerous guy, mentally, very dangerous guy. He wasn't just my match.
SPEAKER_00: What's that? He wasn't the underdog in my match. He was the favorite. Yeah, he wasn't. Then the opposite one happened. Yeah. You were like, people were like, why did Jerry, he doesn't even pull and this, you know, like what majority of the people don't understand that there are some people that has been pulling for decades. They know what they need to be ready. And they would tell you if they are ready to pull.
SPEAKER_00: and so that that that is the thing that some people don't understand you know they just think that like you are an unproven guy you know just like you never proved yourself or something you know yeah let's see let's see and then okay how many people was here 205 people was it yeah and okay i will ask you another one and this is
SPEAKER_00: I'm not going to ask all of them. Wagner, Bortolato, Ferit Osman, left arm. Wagner. Wagner. Wagner for 65. 65%. Yeah. And Jerry?
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to agree with Engin. I'm going to agree with Hermes because I like Wagner. He's fun to watch. He's, he's very vocal and animated and, uh, you know, he's strong, so I'm going with him. Okay. So you choose him because he is fun to watch. Not like because of technical, uh, analysis or anything, you know? Super.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's going to be a very interesting match because Ferit is going inside. And when somebody is going inside, Wagner always finds an opportunity to put to his shoulder. So Ferit needs to take him away to his side to catch Wagner on bicep. And if Wagner puts the shoulder, then you feel like a building collapsing on your arm. See, Ernest knows already.
SPEAKER_03: i think that uh ferret is um definitely the the better competitor he just took a lot of time off but then when he came back he really impressed me when he went against corey and he had a tough match with canadi too he went two matches that same day so yeah yeah yeah yeah and you see jerry hermes just said that he he felt you know how that the shoulder pressure uh
SPEAKER_00: feels you know when Wagner put the shoulder pressure on his arm that one round he wanted to go just imagine that how he felt with Wagner how is he gonna feel against your shoulder pressure
SPEAKER_03: yeah that's that's like saying this kid was pulling me on a bmx bicycle and then boom someone else pulls out a a harley davidson and pulls me completely back pressure i i will i i will put your body in my on my my
SPEAKER_01: my position table you will you will lift his elbow up from the back yeah yeah every every time you should pull full pull for him because too much back pressure and uh okay okay I'm getting kind of scared I told him I told you Hermes don't tell him
SPEAKER_00: He's scared. He said that he's going to back up from the match. I told you not to say it. I told you. I knew he was scared. Yeah. I think I might have just peed my pants. Jerry, I'm going to make a poll about you versus Hermes. No, my friend. No, no. It's better not for him. Why?
SPEAKER_01: Because maybe his mind is thinking about retiring. Don't put the chance more than now. Okay, so you think that he will see the poll results and then he will... Yeah, now the chance he will retire with me is very high. I don't want it to be more than now. Okay, so now we just...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, okay, there is a silky will he cannot he is always underdog because people correctly predict he will get his wrist taking versus Jerry, he was not underdog because we knew Jerry would lose this instead. Okay, thank you for your super chat. And okay, now to 39% Jerry.
SPEAKER_00: Wow. Already 155 volts. Wow. How quick it's not even one minute. 60, 61% Hermes, 39% Jerry. You know, normally, normally it was like 85, 15 Jerry. But I think now when they see you, as I see you now on PC, and then when they see Jerry Hermes, like a light heavyweight, then you are super heavyweight. And then,
SPEAKER_00: people people now realize that you know see 60 40 60 40. yeah 187 what yeah because he used the life like a body so so now people saw you guys together and people realize that the things are different they they have a chance to compare now
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I need to be careful, Hermes. People will start telling me, oh, you hate Hermes and this and that. Do I hate you, Hermes? You hate me. Yeah. People need to realize, do I hate East or West? Which one I hate?
SPEAKER_00: Stavros Stavrides, Ph.D.: East okay. Stavros Stavrides, Ph.D.: Is that. Stavros Stavrides, Ph.D.: yeah. Stavros Stavrides, Ph.D.: percent. Stavros Stavrides, Ph.D.: 38%. Stavros Stavrides, Ph.D.: Jerry I saw the podcast today with Paul Italia, he was saying that you know okay Jerry what do we need to do like he says that you know is is.
SPEAKER_00: ahead and then what to do, what to do. So this is in fact what I try to do, Jerry. When I do East versus West, I try to involve as many as Americans so that because of the experience of that high, really tough level competition, because for 20 years WAF
SPEAKER_00: Europeans, Zuloti, all the Eastern athletes, three times a year, they compete against each other in these events. And more like, it's like iron sharpens iron. You know, more they compete, they go home and then study what they learn, come back stronger, and then the competition. So what I try to do basically, that to invite the Americans here and then they all involved. And then now Americans are part of this high level competition. So I'm hoping that, you know,
SPEAKER_00: it will increase even more i'm talking about the level you know what do you think no i agree i think we had a bad showing at the last one but we're gonna make up for it this time um okay so now we go a few more and then we finish we are here for a little bit more than one hour and then
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Then please tell me that Ermi is going to go back to the gym and work out. After this? Yeah, please. I don't know. I'm not his representative. I'm your manager. I can't pull after my bicep workout. I can't pull you after the workout. Oh, I'm okay with that. Really? Yeah. It's like a training.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, sure. I agree. So you, you are saying you're going to beat him. What he will feel in his hand. We'll see. There is one funny guy that he made the ranking. He said, one is Levan, two is Vitaly, three was poor Hermes, five Jerry, six Morozov, seven Gennady. How did,
SPEAKER_00: the legend went up there when he lost to dave and then dave has so many losses to other guys and just come on a little bit a little bit common sense he needs to be proven you know this oh yeah anyways so okay less than less than four weeks a little bit more than three weeks to arrive here and then then then we will we will find out and what's gonna happen
SPEAKER_00: and jerry you want to say anything more to your opponent don't get hurt rest up and uh just make sure you work out in the gym stop picking up real weights he tell you to lift the real weights not the fake weights okay next time we try
SPEAKER_00: uh okay okay and get asked if you can if you can destroy devon yeah yeah really yeah i think one with you last time seven years ago six years ago yeah yep three to two
SPEAKER_00: It was a very close match. He won three rounds, the other guy won two rounds. It was not like domination. It was a good match. But I'm telling you, as of now, I kind of think that everyone is in their best. I think that Devon is at his best. You will say that he is not young anymore.
SPEAKER_00: like it's just like with stem cell i realized that like you have incredible incredible experience and knowledge but you cannot perform because your body doesn't react because it's limited with injuries but once you became healthy and now it's like a miracle you know
SPEAKER_00: It's like you can be even like 20% stronger, not because there is any hormone that you get stronger by the stem cell, but it is because now you are capable of doing it. Did you see his damage? He went this way, he went hook.
SPEAKER_00: He went sideways, he went top roll, open arm top roll. He did everything, you know. It just shows that the guy is healthy. So that is everybody's dream. You are 45, 50 years old. You have been pulling for 30 years, but you are like, I wish I was young and healthy. Now I know everything, but I can't, you know, because my body hurts, my arm hurts. And now suddenly it doesn't hurt. And then it's like, you know, wow. Your chest now is okay. My chest?
SPEAKER_00: On my chest, I'm not sure if it's okay. I just go to the gym. I do like 5-10 kilo cable cross. It's uncomfortable, but it's not torn. It was probably some strain. A little bit, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Spasm, you know, spasm. It happened. I pin Ray, I come back, and then after match, he hits me. So that is when I'm like not really...
SPEAKER_01: like reacting back you know that that is probably this happened when that time you know but i will come back even stronger um um i suggest to you before our match because you are a good guy good uh yeah all guy but yeah guy and uh
SPEAKER_01: to do to will do a good warm up your shoulder the elbow the wrist for don't have a big pain after our match i suggest to you only this i warm up with you but then you won't get up very good your shoulder and your elbow here yeah no yeah if you want i i can give you the some dumbbells or some elastic
SPEAKER_01: a warm-up yeah why are you suggesting because you are afraid that he will get hurt you will injure him yeah yeah he's a good guy i don't want to oh i don't want to go down you know this i want to go with him to to eat something after our match right i told you i'm gonna buy you a drink after i beat you ah
SPEAKER_01: I'm still going to buy you a drink after I beat you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But very good warm-up. I will do a stretching for you, but before the match, very good warm-up, okay? This is perfect workout. Warm-up, workout, and I will do stretching for your arm. And this is a super training. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So you are saying basically that if he doesn't warm up good, you will really seriously, seriously injure him. Yeah. So you are just because you love him as a person. Yeah. Like your older brothers, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you don't want to retire after that match, because I will do stretching for his forearm, but the warm up is better to do before the match. Cool. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: yeah let's see let's see uh would you would you challenge uh i don't know after this match like is there anyone on your mind if you win yes if you see you this time you like right then you now win right
SPEAKER_01: after i win after we win i don't know maybe between laritino or levas or leva if we come back danish
SPEAKER_01: Not sure, not sure. I think Denis is focused on that one. Now my focus is only on Jerry. After Divi we can see everything. Okay, okay. After he will lose with me, it's a good match for him with Laletin. Okay. For him.
SPEAKER_00: okay so he should pull she should pull a lot and after he loses against yeah okay that that that is how we how we how we do that yeah anyways guys you know but this is a pro we don't know if he will hurt too much or not maybe when we don't know when we come back i don't know i i really cannot wait i really cannot
SPEAKER_01: like wait show me your arm Jerry show me no no like this where is your bicep i don't see your bicep where is you you see something hanging i don't see him i said ah i don't know i don't know i think i think oh
SPEAKER_01: you can you can help him a little bit and you know only that why you don't hate me because he sees exactly the difference between me because he helped the the other favorite he helped the no he's trying to be nice to you he's trying to he says you look like on the chat you know you guys are writing things you know guys um
SPEAKER_00: I have been arm wrestling for more than 30 years. Um, I have won world titles first time in 94, last time in 2018, I have broken so many records and still I have them. I have been mentioned by John as like one time he mentioned, like, as like a second God, if he didn't exist, they will mention that many times Jerry mentioned that many times.
SPEAKER_00: Like there are like countless people who would like to pull against me. I'm gonna run after my own dreams, you know. My dream is going 85 kilo and win the East versus West world title. So someone from-
SPEAKER_00: japan or someone from africa from there and there you know just i mean just because they wanna make writing for themselves to mention me i'm not gonna run like after everyone just like you know just all the time mentioning my name or something you know especially if this guy is just probably ranked like 3 000 or something in the history
SPEAKER_00: come on man just have respect just because everyone everyone everyone can mention you know i mean they are asking you what is your ranking uh oh devil not at me yeah what do you think the devil is ranked right now in the world i think
SPEAKER_01: He is in the top five, but not in the top three. And you? Top... I don't know. We need to see the match with Gennaro. And Gerry, where do you rank Devon?
SPEAKER_03: Top six. Top six. But you don't know if it is three, four, five, six, or you think that it's exactly six or in top six somewhere. It depends. You know, like, I don't know how Devin, because Devin has the loss to Gennady. I don't know how Devin would do with Artem. I don't even know how Devin would do with Rivas. But, and then where's Dennis going to be at? So there's a lot of factors in there. But I...
SPEAKER_03: I think, like Ermi says, when Gennady and Artem go, that'll give us a good gauge there to see, is Gennady more dominant than Artem? Because then we can base that with Devin, right? And then see where it falls. Do you guys also agree? Maybe if Gennady will win with Morozov and after this Devo will win with...
SPEAKER_00: more uh gennady and for sure in the top five top three yeah but do you guys think that like when you talk about top seven or something or top eight doesn't matter or six do you guys think that it totally depends on the matchup like sometimes
SPEAKER_00: number three may lose to number five but maybe the number four and then you understand like it like we rank them somewhere by the latest result usually this is how we do but do you do you do you think that sometimes you know like it doesn't mean that number one will be number two and all of the other number two will be all the rest number three will be everyone who is ranked like four five six seven sometimes you know
SPEAKER_00: this guy can be this guy, and this guy can be this guy, and this guy can be this guy. But yeah, I think that the style also makes a little bit difference. This is what I believe. Yeah. Do you think that, like, for example, if, what do you, okay, you guys said that, I think Gennady said that Morozov has more chance, or 50-50, you said, against Gennady?
SPEAKER_00: 50-50. And Jerry, I kind of forgot, what did you say about their match? I said 55-45. Yeah, yeah, 55, me too. For what, Morozov, you said, Jerry? I said 55, Gennady, 45, Morozov. Oh, okay, and you said the opposite way, Hermes? Yeah. Yeah, okay, okay, I understand, I understand. So I think this match will tell us something, your match,
SPEAKER_00: will tell us something, and after that, Gennady versus Devon will tell us something, and then it will go on, you know. I think that, but as we say, like, whatever the ranking is the current ranking, you know. Like, we cannot really just, I don't know how to say, it is going to change. There is no ranking that forever stays the same, you know. More matches will happen, and more we will see. You want two more, but you can't change everything. Three more.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah I agree I agree yeah yeah anything can change but how are we gonna do if the match happen this how I do the ranking you know like you beat the guy you take his spots if somebody
SPEAKER_00: Just say that fifth place guy, Jerry, somehow beat Jerry and then he takes his spot. You know, it's just that this is how it is going to work because it's the most recent. So it is not really making sense to talk about, oh, this guy beat you eight years ago. This guy beat you five years ago. And then while everyone is here, you know, I will also explain why I rated Levan's endurance nine.
SPEAKER_00: Um, people used to understand that, like there is no other, there is no other combat physical combat sport. When one of the guys, a hundred percent won the match it's good. It's submission. It is just knockout. The match doesn't continue anymore. The match continues. As long as there is a chance, the other guy to win. So arm resting is the only thing that, you know?
SPEAKER_00: one needs to come to 4-0, and after 4-0, the last two rounds are happening. Yes, it just showed that on that day you had better endurance, but in fact, LeBron needed only win, endurance to win four rounds. Just imagine in this way, if Devon versus Gennady was not best of five, but it was full five rounds, full five rounds,
SPEAKER_00: And just say that first round was a mistake and Devon was 3-0 after three rounds. And then Gennady won the last two rounds because we do the full five rounds. Were we going to say, and then when Gennady beat Devon, Devon said, I'm done. So are we going to say that Devon has bad injuries? Are we going to give him seven rate just because of the one match? And are we going to forget all the matches that Devon had
SPEAKER_00: all the matches that Levon had there, all six, zero, six, zero, six, zero, six rounds he's winning. And then one round we see, and then the guy's endurance is five already. Levon, five endurance. Do you agree with that? Yeah. What I just say that, you know, like with this logic, we should also after Devon versus Gennady match, even if it was three, two, four, Devon, then we should, we should
SPEAKER_00: ranked like devon's uh endurance like seven because he lost he was gassed out after three rounds you know
SPEAKER_00: But it doesn't work that way. You cannot judge. You may see a guy, maybe on that day he is no good, he loses in hook. But the guy has beaten tons of guys in hook. Are we going to go only by the one match? And then we don't know anything else about that guy. Just last match. This is what I say that, you know, people may have bad day, people may have, they say, oh, because Levan's weight was so high. So what if he loses now 20 kilos? Are we going to like, like say now it's 10?
SPEAKER_00: no it's not like judgmental one match we just look at him you know and then yeah this is what i try to say you know okay guys let's let's finish it thank you very much and then i think hype will be very good you both get you know
SPEAKER_00: ready without any any any kind of injury any kind of uh excuses don't come up with another shoulder injury or something yeah i'm telling you both of you any of you comes with oh i hurt my shoulder i'm directly giving the title to the one who shows up
SPEAKER_00: you agree right at the beginning yeah yeah yeah so be careful be careful with your bench pressing be careful you with your table training rms don't hurt yourself and even you hurt yourself don't tell me anything coming loose is better okay yeah
SPEAKER_00: and then we will see the east versus west and then he needs to put the lights right he needs to put the lights yeah yeah yeah i i think that i think that he was just like he was just checking the reaction of you that oh i got injured or or is it or not and then next day when you say like you are a you know and then it was my birthday my friend this day
SPEAKER_01: Your present came through. Yeah. Your birthday came through. I was angry for this. And you little bit damaged my day. Well, that was your birthday present for me. I will damage your mind on the 29th of July. Yeah. Because you made his birthday terrible. You will pay for this. Angry. That was your birthday present. I had to hurt myself so I could make it a little bit more level. You will pay for this.
SPEAKER_00: But did you hear that, Ermes? Did you hear that he had good intention? He said that he is too much for you and he hurt himself, so now he came down to your level. It's a birthday present to you. But anyways, he will pay. You will, yeah, okay. Take care, guys. Take care, guys. I'll pay for the drinks after I whoop his ass.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. See? Such a good guy. After he beat you, he's going to pay you for the drinks. You're going to buy him ice tea, right? Whatever he wants. He drinks wine. Good dreaming. Okay, guys.
