None: Hello, guys. You just survived a shipwreck and found two exiled fugitives. Hello, Mom. Hello, Richard. Nice to see you guys.
None: Yeah, yeah. Everyone's gonna join soon. Hello, hello, hello everyone.
Engin Terzi: Let's get the messages from there. Hello, Hasselstrap. Hello, Proqueen, Armresting, Hans and Sword, Josh Cook, Timmy, Sean, Rick, Armresting. Hey, Derek, Kyra, Samuel, Irakli.
Engin Terzi: your kindness alaikum sultan yeah me neither my friends me neither yeah then we will be pulling stone left very soon yeah um standard sonic is good match very good match yeah
Engin Terzi: good day joseph thank you my friend thank you hello to boston victor hello my friends rick um mustafa how much you are ready for some rates
Engin Terzi: I think I will be around 80, 80%. This is my estimation. He has the things that he gets treated like his fanboys. It is different thing, my friend. I think that we need to make, uh, like, like the things that are not black or white. There's gray area. Every, every mistake is not cheating. You know, there may be wrong call, but cheating is different cheating.
Engin Terzi: is bad intention the same referee was the ref for the britney match and people thought that at that match the same ref favors devil so this time they say that they think that he favors gannady so so at that time referee was great this time people says if he wasn't good you know just like uh he's coming soon oh a lot of messages show us flags
Engin Terzi: Are you announcing the rematch date today? No, it is already announced. It's August 26th. No, I'm lazy to shave, my friend. We will see Bart at East versus West. We are going to have an American referee, but not Bart. It should be here in eight minutes. I started a little bit early. Have you had any thoughts of getting JPL? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: We need to see them, you know, where they are, you know. Hello, Phil. Yeah, my friend, I don't know about that, but I didn't really. We need to...
Engin Terzi: I'm gonna, I'm gonna try. Don't move. Go! Not ready to go. Ready to go, just always, always. 30 years, you know, like, causes. Tata Shinks, yes, Tata Shinks have a match with Zurab Tawberidze on... Hello, Silky Bulky, hello. Victor Oliveira, who do you have on winning between Devon and Dave?
Engin Terzi: don't know if it is i don't know as far as i saw i give the edge to devon but since i'm not organizer i don't know maybe i should still not say hello martin um the king of the table match is on june 24th get your pay-per-view it will be like every time people says that the match the the card is not so exciting at king of the table
Engin Terzi: then something incredible happens like like Dave Sheffield versus Laletin like like Ermes versus Levan so never be sure about I mean you have a poor Dave no my friend Dave is just to be too strong for someone at my size um
Engin Terzi: Where do you think other armwrestling organizations get money for the organization? I don't know which one you're talking about. I think this question should be addressed to them. Dennis Flankov used to be a hoop bowler, but then he started like that open arm top row. That one just came.
Engin Terzi: dustin has yeah i agree yeah that is how it is hello on the on the uh yeah it shows us side by side you know on the uh by side let me see no no no no no no no the opposite way yeah now it looks this way but on the on the uh
Engin Terzi: live stream we are side by side yeah forgive me i'm still kind of eating a little bit no there's nothing to forgive you are five minutes early so what's new buddy what's going on what is new my 400 here oh yeah yeah you're training hard huh not really trust me i can't no just a little bit
Engin Terzi: just elbow elbow like better than before but still you know how about you oh i feel so good yeah i'm strong i'm very good yeah you just need a little bit rest yeah but i'm i like i'm going so hard i think i'll get probably
Devon Larratt: about two weeks rest before dave so i pull you over you are saying that when you pull stronger you're gonna do some table time there and you will finish yeah i think so yeah yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't underestimate i wouldn't underestimate jordan dave yeah oh no not not even a bit but it the thing is it's interesting the timing for both of us is is tight
Devon Larratt: right like dave and i just competed six weeks ago uh i've been busy busy busy but you know i've been arm wrestling i mean i'm sure that he's not it's not like he's had months and months and months to prepare either we're both you know coming from a six week uh last major competition so i think his preparation is different i think his preparation is all
Engin Terzi: focus on just finishing here as quick as possible more like strength yeah yeah probably probably that's going to be interesting the problem you know the problem is i'm going to be so dumb
Devon Larratt: that's the big problem he's not very smart he's gonna kill you you know yeah after he beats you he's gonna say tell me again you know he's gonna say he's not gonna say anything he's not gonna open his mouth the entire time he's gonna be completely quiet like a like a just like a mouse and uh
Devon Larratt: the thing is is the problem mangan is he's forgotten how to count he used to be able to count to like three or four back long ago long ago he can count to like three or four and the last little while he's kind of been stuck at two i mean one two he can count he can't quite get any for and now he can't even he can't even say one and he can't even talk to he can't even count to one
Devon Larratt: It's a problem for him. Do you also imply that you're going to beat him like 6-0? He won't be able to stay one? Not even one. You think? That'll be hard. 6-0. That could be very bad. 6-0. Because if I stop him with shoulder position around one, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Engin Terzi: You think you're going to go there on one? Maybe. Maybe. It's returning, Engin. That's the thing. Like, slowly. You didn't really directly go inside with Gennady. You first did the high hook. Right. And then slowly. You better not go there right away, you know, before you get, like, a little bit hand control. And then, you know, with control, you know. How about you know better? You know better.
Devon Larratt: Because it'll be terrible if that happens. Like, I'll feel bad afterwards. Like, that night, I'll probably feel a little bit bad. But that's okay, because it'll feel so good when I'm doing it. You know how that is. Are you going to be mean to young Ray, or are you just going to kill him? When you say, like, if I'm going to be mean to him, you mean that, like, you know, just, like,
Engin Terzi: know this yeah you're just gonna beat him up and just be done with them or are you gonna give him maybe he'll beat me who knows you know maybe he will beat me who knows you think that i mean didn't i watch wasn't there a practice video of you floating around on youtube and this is like when you're not even that good of shape and you're just killing him this is just practice i don't know how many people he pulled before me i have no idea it was right after east versus west two
Engin Terzi: February 12th, 2022. A little bit more than a year ago, about 16 months ago. You never know about it. I'm getting older. He's going like this and I'm going like this. Well, who do you think has a higher chance of winning? Me or you? I think both have the same.
Engin Terzi: same so both have like a slight age so probably six zero for both of us that that's the plan but the plan is different than you know the reality you know like mike tyson has something like like everyone has some plan until they get like you know punch from their face or something you know just right you never know yeah you think dave's gonna try and punch me in the face
Engin Terzi: I meant in arm wrestling, you know, Tyson talks about boxing and then we talk about arm wrestling, you know, Dave's punch is probably side pressure, you know, so, and then probably Ray's punch is just boom, hooking, you know, and then my tornado is not that bad, but we will see, you know, I think I'm going to mostly rest from now on, you know, like, I have like 18 days. I may do some, like maybe,
Engin Terzi: Justin training and then maybe I can do some pull-ups and that's all. No more table. I did a lot of table times, you know. Easy stuff. Easy, easy. Yeah, yeah. But before that, every three days, five days, I did a lot of pull. You know, when I say a lot, it's 20, 20, 25 is for me a lot. For you, it's 250 is a lot, you know. Probably not. Regular, 250 is regular for you. This weekend, this Saturday, that was awesome.
Engin Terzi: I saw you pulling everyone. I saw you with Pavlo. I saw you with Paul. I saw you first with John. And the day before you went there, you had trained him. You are not a human being. I'm not extreme. It's hard to surprise me. I'm not saying. But I still cannot understand. You are at the age of 47? 48 now.
Engin Terzi: Oh, 48. Okay. So for like five months, we are at the same age. Five months later, I will be a year older again. Anyway, so like, it's hard to surprise me, you know, more than 30 years in armwrestling. And then whenever I think about your age, and then whenever I think what you are doing, that many old tables, times, and then
Engin Terzi: In your age, if you are 18, even at 18 years old, nobody can do that. People would be just holding their arms. Doesn't matter, 20, 25. And then you do that. And then I realized something is different with you. Seriously, it's just not like extreme. Something is different with you. And I haven't seen it. I don't know. Maybe this has been a long journey.
Engin Terzi: Like I just do more and more and more. You need to slow down, you know. Like when you pull this much and then to have at this level, you know, sometimes you need to rest to improve, you understand? You are not even resting. You are just already...
Engin Terzi: millions of miles on your arm you know millions of miles i sometimes think that hey they won't be careful you know just like i mean and then then i'm saying like what are you talking about this this is what he has been doing and then it's working so just stick on your own self you know i said to myself there is one supermarket college swedish farmer hello hanging you look strong i wish you
Engin Terzi: story story story story i wish you luck on your mask thank you very very much my friend thank you very much thank you thank you yeah tell me have you ever seen or heard of the story of the african king african kings talking about lying or just real african king human being real life african king there's a story about an african king and um i got told
Devon Larratt: about the story when I was quite young. And it's a bit of a metaphor. I've talked about it lots in the past. But to me, it's about a certain way to live. So the story goes that in Africa, there was this part of Africa from long ago when a king
Devon Larratt: at the height of his power would would call a great assembly and he would walk through the crowd through all his people and he would slowly cut pieces of himself off and throw them to the crowd you know he's here peace there and he basically would become part of the people
Devon Larratt: you ever heard of that before i have never heard but there was an instrumental yeah to me it's it's just a metaphor of uh of passing energy on i understand listen yeah and you do the same thing everybody does it everybody kind of gives themselves over to their community one way or another you do so much oh you're talking about you're talking about pulling so much
Engin Terzi: that's my that's the way i tell the story this part i understand this part that you train with everyone and becoming one part with everyone i understand but this being um how to say like a strategy to become the best
Devon Larratt: like i know that if i really wanted to be the absolute best i may would do things just a tiny bit differently but for me it's just so much fun that it's almost worth more you know
Engin Terzi: Like, it's almost worth more to me to do it. And the thing is, it does work really well. I think you do the things differently, you know, depending on opponents, you know, and this and that, you know. If you had a lot of Devon match, I think that three months you will be in your cave, you know. This is what I realized. For Gennady, you will probably, right after Devon match, you will be focusing there, you know, yeah.
Devon Larratt: yeah and but it is gb19 why is dennis disappointed on devon taking many matches you know i haven't talked to dennis but i'm sure we'll be just fine and i'm sure that we will have the match it's one that i think we're both looking forward to but i wouldn't feel right i'm wrestling dennis unless i felt
Devon Larratt: I was worthy. I mean, they used to be both Dave and Gennady. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I think that that's fair. Like, to me, I hold, a lot of people have said, oh, you're over-inflating Dennis, but I really believe Dennis is, like, Dennis is dangerous. Super dangerous. I really believe that. Like, I know LeVon's injured right now, so, I mean, I think LeVon's gonna be fine, but
Devon Larratt: when i think about who can beat all the very very top guys dennis is always the first guy i think of he is i mean he's so strong and just because he hasn't proved it yet to me it doesn't really matter to me i know i know how good he is i and i know what he has been and i know the way he's training and i see it and i touched him and i felt and there's he's just as strong as he was if not stronger so to me
Devon Larratt: I have to be worthy of the match. If I come off of a loss to Gennady, well, I mean, look, I would pull Dennis anyways. I will pull Dennis, you know, but I think the match is so much better if... I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree. I agree, yeah. I agree. And that's your plan. But the thing is, are you going to pull him at the time that Cardi has agreed?
Engin Terzi: For example, normally I was thinking to set East vs West 10 in October. But from 21st of October to 30th of October, there is World Combat Games in Saudi Arabia. All the WAF athletes are going there. And right before that, September 23rd is the King of the Table. So if I put earlier, it will be like a few weeks only.
Devon Larratt: So do you think that like something like November 4th or November 11th would work for you? Or of course, like if you think that, you know, like you're going to pull him. I don't really want to commit to the date quite yet because I know that that can be problematic when you look too far ahead. I have 100%. If I beat Dave and then I beat Gennady,
Engin Terzi: 100 the next high level right-handed match that i want will be dennis yeah but this guy made his training program according to the day yeah yeah yeah he's going very long right so i mean he doesn't put i want to put anyone in he wants to pull you so that is whenever you say that okay today this and this guy doesn't know like
Devon Larratt: when he's gonna pull you he's just like yeah you know when you are when you are uh uh athletes you know you would like to know you know like and then yeah and i understand that he wants you know this long this long window of of uh you know whatever you want to call it he wants that long preparation period um and
Devon Larratt: I mean, I've done these a lot. I've done these long windows a lot in my career. And to be quite honest, I prefer now these shorter windows. I prefer them. So I'm just reluctant to nail a date down too far in advance. But I can assure him and the community that 100%
Devon Larratt: I want to arm wrestle Dennis right hand when he's happy and when I'm happy. I just know that coming off with Dave and Gennady, I may not. And the thing is, I don't want an excuse when I pulled Dennis either. So if I don't feel quite right after the Gennady match, which is a very high likelihood, I may ask for another month or month and a half. So this is October. It was. So this is what I said. November 11th is another month. So it will be almost three months.
Engin Terzi: a little bit like less than three months but two and a half months steven martinez thank you thank you for your uh support he says engine and devon and he put two hearts thank you my friends thank you for your support listen this guy i will tell you something this guy was ready to pull you and then you know you said that at the beginning that you know you're gonna pull him if you beat gennady
Engin Terzi: And then we saw that the match was very close. It could go either way. And we also saw that there was some calls. I'm 100% sure it was not intentional, but it affected the result of the match. And then whenever I asked the fans, almost 90% said that they want to see the rematch. And then there has to be something. The match had to be close. It was very, very close.
Engin Terzi: Was there some decisions that affected the results? Looks like we cannot take anything away from Gennady, but there was, you know, like unintentionally, you know, some unhappy scenario for a rematch. Everything was ready. Gennady wasn't going to do that. You wanted to do that. But there, Dennis Dennis got upset.
Devon Larratt: yeah well that's the problem with planning too far ahead and that's why i never like to do it and i don't want i don't want to plan too far ahead and i'm sorry if he's waiting on me i apologize um busy busy busy you know uh there's a lot of people i want to arm wrestle dennis is extremely high on the list but out of respect to dennis you know i need to be worthy right i need to beat gennady i need to beat dave and then
Devon Larratt: even still i should come in with dennis it's a big deal like i cut my hair for dennis like it's a big deal um it will be when i face dennis there i i don't want to leave any stone unturned and and the thing is is
Engin Terzi: As you know, Engin, there's so much going on in the sport right now. For me, it's no problem. For me, it's no problem. I just don't want to upset Denis because this guy, I always respected as an athlete. I didn't know him much about his personality. The more we get to know each other, the more I talk. I cannot talk directly because we don't understand each other, but there is translation. And then my respect grows.
Devon Larratt: oh yeah my very favorite people i i love the guy and i think he's incredible he's inspirational um in my opinion dennis is
Engin Terzi: one of the greatest athletes that the sport has ever seen and trust me his personality is oh yeah at least as good as you know his uh athletic abilities the guy is just i so much respect i mean yeah and i don't want i don't want him to be upset with me i don't want him to be upset with you as long as you guys are fine for me there's no problem there is yeah we're going to be fine look at i'm i hope jenna's understand just
Devon Larratt: Babkin, give me a call. If you're watching, Babkin, give me a call. We'll figure it out. We'll sort it out. I have so much to talk about. Everything is good. Dennis and I will face each other. I'll give you as much notice as possible. We'll do it right. We will fight. Dennis, I'm looking forward to it like crazy. It's what my life is about. Of course I want to arm everyone. Remember, people were telling you that you are now facing the...
Engin Terzi: Eastern Europeans, and now you are just like, like, how many? Like, Rudnick? Yeah, I mean, people can say whatever they want. No, but do you realize how many Eastern Europeans you put in, and all these guys are like, there is Kalle, a Sedis farmer. Hello, Devon, you will kill Dave. You are the best for arm wrestling. And he says, what? What one?
Engin Terzi: Sorry, something. Thank you for your super chat, my friend. Thank you. And then big grow God. Devon, we need to pull our resources and build the field of dream centers. Are missing in North America. If we build, if they will come, how strong did Justin Hayat feel to you? Did he impress you most?
Engin Terzi: yeah um i'll answer the dustin hyatt question first i think so wow i mean so i didn't think that dustin was actually going to beat sam yet uh i know how good uh sam is and to me where is he at yes sam i mean that's nothing to take away but where is he is he like really uh at his best but dustin's hook inability dustin in hook is good
Devon Larratt: Very good. But Justin's hook inability to hook for someone in hook, I think is even better. What do you think? You have the same impression? I think Justin Hyatt is the best lightweight talent that I've seen in quite some time here. He's very good. And he still has so far to go. But his physicality is really, really rare. Like his...
Devon Larratt: His conditioning, his physical strength, his health, it's very rare, very uncommon. The kid is very well put together, smart, and technically, I mean, he's 22 years old, but the rate that he's improving, he improves within the event. That's the thing. It's not like he's even improving event to event to event. You watch him take a loss,
Devon Larratt: He comes back to the table. He does something different. He's learning very quickly. He's quite incredible. This is how it happens, General. When you have so much desire, you find a way. Yeah, yeah. He's absolutely someone to watch. You know, if you could pick an athlete to watch coming up from kind of the beginning, now's the time to lock into Justin Hyatt.
Engin Terzi: Because I would say that there's an extreme probability that this guy is going to be our North American lightweight champion for some time. Do you know that I set a match for Matt Mask? Who's he pulling? Most likely, we were thinking October. But again, it may be like November 4th or 11th. And he's going to pull Frank Lamparelli from Italy.
Devon Larratt: Oh, perfect. Beautiful match. Almost. Yeah. Same build. Same. Same. Beautiful match. Beautiful match. Love it. Love it. That's a great match for Matt. It's a great match for Frank. Yeah. Like that match a lot. Incredible. Yeah. Yeah.
Devon Larratt: that that category was the most stacked the uh the 240 pound division there was probably a good six or seven guys who were at a very high level you know that uh you know definitely you thought could all place maybe not i think that matt was the favorite to win right from the beginning but but certainly there was a lot like that wasn't an easy class to win there were a lot in there yeah
Devon Larratt: um jerome loud is very interesting to me the best match of the entire event was right when you called me yeah yeah with uh jerome and blm it was so close such a hard fight brandon pulled incredibly jerome is a very good athlete um but that finished them they were both kind of dead after that yeah yeah yeah
Devon Larratt: Martin Regalski is asking, Devon, what do you think about Bacho? Everybody needs to stay away from Bacho. Everybody needs to stay away from him. Yeah, that kid is something very, very special. I mean, at 18, his hand was wider than mine. At 18, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Special human being. Yeah.
Devon Larratt: yeah georgia all of georgia is so strong right now and and bacho shows that it's not just their their current guys they got guys coming like there's there's juniors and young guys in georgia who are ready all ready to take up the torch um bacho i don't see anybody did you see who i said with elizabeth
Devon Larratt: No, no, no, no. Bacho is going to compete with Waf. I said with Terence Opperman. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. I thought you had Bacho in him. No, yes, yes. I did it. But then the guy said that he needs to focus on... Okay, he's doing Waf. Okay, got it. Okay, okay. Yeah, Terence. Yeah, that's great. That's great. Terence is going to... He's got a match there. He's got a match. That kid is something.
Engin Terzi: like uh i would i would have been very that rhino match i i'd be very interested to see that one once uh once they're both clear yeah then i will tell you something whenever i started organizing so many matches you know what people said you are sitting so many matches you won't be interesting anymore after some time we will be running running out of matches no that that that is they're just getting more interesting you need to invest the mothers are giving birth
Engin Terzi: the lions all over the world you know yeah you only need to give them a chance that's all you need to do so you see many many guys will come like them many guys yeah yeah if you if you sorry sorry sorry sorry um okay let me read from here that if you get that legacy hammer back
Devon Larratt: i will get a no limit logo tattoo okay well you never know what happens you never know you read the question yeah i just read it i just read it okay this is how it could go this is how it could go somehow levon's a bit hurt and he gets a match somehow with somebody
Engin Terzi: We'll say Vitaly or Ermes. And then Jerry comes along and beats those guys. And then I beat Jerry and I have the legacy hammer. Who knows? You may directly get it from one of the Eastern European athletes. Who knows? I keep going. I keep going. I don't stop. There is another question. Do you think judges made a huge impact during the match round one?
Devon Larratt: i think that what i like to focus on in that match for me the thing is when you look back on matches what you want to do is you want to take lessons that will make you better and that that is that's champion mind that that improved even there was some problems if you stuck there
Devon Larratt: are not going to get any problems but you need to go on and then see what you can do to not to go into the same situation again yeah what what i hold on to from that match is in the end in round five when i had my position he blew my elbow off the pad because i could not keep my angle otherwise
Devon Larratt: this is what i hold on to and in the end he beat me with that move and i know that both of us will learn both of us will learn from from what happened in that match and what happened in round one with the refs is inconsequential because it that that will likely not happen again what will happen again is we will fight again
Devon Larratt: with knowledge that we've given each other. And the knowledge that I have to take away is I have to become more balanced. I need more inside game. So that's what I've taken from the match. That's what I will appear with next time. Next time, I will have more inside presence. Can I tell you what I think about that match and my analyzing? My analyzing is you did not go directly inside with him.
Engin Terzi: You went first like over pronate. If you go over pronate, he will go like this. So what you did, you control his pronator without giving up on your pronator. You take him and then you put him in that position and with your own control, you went to inside. So this was different than going direct inside. Of course. And then you had everything. Like I also asked you personally, could you finish him anytime you want? You felt like you could.
Engin Terzi: So somehow the second round, when you either you went out like this and then you ended up like this and you kind of felt like you need to go inside to avoid this. But to me, going in between those two, not inside, not totally outside, but in between, just to use here to block his flop, but not to get here either. I think that that is the key, you know, from outside look.
Devon Larratt: I agree with everything you said. Now, when we came together for the first time, there were many unknowns for Gennady and I. Right. And in the first round, when we were feeling each other out, I believe that both of us round one were wanted to test each other's hands. We both had like a hand outside opening. We were both kind of pulling outside a little bit was the lead. I won that battle.
Devon Larratt: and then i transitioned to inside that match i would have won i would have won that match now round two sorry not even round two round one continued right because it was a restart uh gnadi gnadi's so smart um he switched to an inside strategy and i mistakenly changed to an outside strategy because i realized that i had control there yeah right yeah and that resulted in the flop versus the top roll which he won
Devon Larratt: and then it shifted the battle now that we understand that he the thing is a good flop can really nullify an outside opening it can especially if you open a little bit outside your shoulder which i tend to do so i knew that well the re in my opinion the real technical brilliance the real outstanding arm wrestling is in done in the middle
Engin Terzi: the spot between inside and outside yes yes yes right you remember you were explaining you know remember you had a video that you were saying like and then this is it like right here am i mistaken you were talking about that that's right yeah yeah yeah the hot like the high up hook this if you have that position you kind of have control over you you control the arm and hand through the top pronators
Devon Larratt: and everything, you know, you control arm and grenade over the guy's position. Very powerful position. Very powerful position. But the truth is, is to have that position, you really need to be able to pull on both sides. You need to be able to pull on the inside and you need to be able to pull on outside. If you are always running to the outside or running to the inside, you maybe don't have a strong center, right?
Devon Larratt: needs to be balanced yes that's the best way i think but the problem what happened is wal shifted the north american athletes a little bit shifted all of us what do you mean
Devon Larratt: so i i really believe so wal for us was a big deal it was a big deal had a massive impact on arm wrestling culture in north america not north america all over the world yeah yeah it did and um the changes that they made to the table it really empowered uh outside arm wrestling very it added those two inches it's a big deal yeah
Devon Larratt: And it wasn't matched. Right. So what it is, it's shifted. It shifted this a little bit more to the outside. And now we kind of and I think that we all knew it. Like, I think a lot of the athletes said, you know, we shouldn't do this. It's a shift. And now that we've returned to kind of the central point and we build a pad around that, I think what it's done is it's it's making time.
Engin Terzi: yeah so because it is getting closer again so this favor athletes as someone like jerry because that people don't have much room to go back so they need to come closer to him so it favors the inside pullers right so it just it just shifts it back to balance again and because so many guys shifted to the outside myself included
Devon Larratt: we're getting a bit of a wake-up call that yeah we need to work our inside once again because if you just pull outside on a long pad with a long way to run you can be very successful but if it's balanced there's trump cards the flop wrist is a trump right you take his hand it doesn't matter and if and if you don't have more space to run away if you have even space great move very good move so
Engin Terzi: So yeah, so I need, it's a lesson for me to return to balance, return to more hooking and pressing styles when I train, when I practice so that I don't get caught with that stuff. But Devin, how beautiful it is that, you know, I am also more than 30 years, you are also more than 30 years in the sport. And like, it is good to come to a day that we learn one more thing.
Engin Terzi: It's beautiful because we needed to meet more people. Gennady is a very unique character. He can pull in every position. And the guy also showed, do you think it's okay that I made his trading cards from 9.5 to 10?
Devon Larratt: mean you kind of got to now don't you yeah yours is 10 already but now both are 10 you know because i think that he is good as well you know he's very good yeah he's definitely an endurance expert for sure but i really look forward to our rematch i very much am looking forward and i wish him the best of luck versus arnold uh yeah arnold yeah i think it's going to be a great match i i think gennady can win this match i think he can i think it's close match um
Engin Terzi: we'll see how artem's top role stands up to uh canadi's inside game that'll be interesting yeah yeah yeah i mean i i just like i feel sorry for them yeah i feel sorry for them that that kind of horsepower and endurance
Engin Terzi: will have to hit each other like wow you know just because artem has good endurance too yes yes that that both of them incredible address and like i think we will just sit down and we will be like you know wow yeah i think so yeah yeah very good if if you if you uh super hits and garage grinder are missing can we now respect on artem the top roll kings
Engin Terzi: Corporal King's name. How good is he right now? Who should he face right-handed? Thank you for your super chat. Yeah, Artem has been doing very well, and he sent me email, but he said he's not available in July, so we will try to find him a better time.
Engin Terzi: But you know, all the guys that are qualified, normally when I was going to say six matches, the winner's from his winner's room, but that's six matches, six matches. So the total is six matches. But whenever I saw that, I mean, like better match there can be, you understand? So it looks like I'm ending up saying 12 matches.
Engin Terzi: yeah for each of them is separate opponent from there so just to make sure that you know it will be as close as possible demon dave um thank you for your support and thank you one more time my friend and corey warren two legends devon when you stop dave and we get a promise to hear yeah big boy
Devon Larratt: know i was thinking about that and and i think now because we're almost the same size i think i think i should probably say yeah medium-sized boy because we're kind of the same now when you pull him you were lighter yeah last time yeah last time when i pulled him i was probably 260 almost 260. and he was 275.
Devon Larratt: yeah i think so 275 280. yeah steven martin and thank you for your support devon will we see the strongest version of you when you face dennis i will certainly give dennis the utmost respect and come in the best form possible and you'll see in your head oh yeah yeah for dennis for dennis it's another all-in moment for dennis it's a big deal yeah then it's a plank off to me i mean
Engin Terzi: That's a very, very incredible athlete and I have to go all in for that. Will Devon and Morozov pull this year? I can say unlikely. Yeah, unlikely, but of course I'd love to pull him. That's an incredible young athlete. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. You know the girl, the Elizabeth, the 70-kilo winner, 154.
Engin Terzi: From Virginia. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I set her against Carolina Pettersson. Nice match. Beautiful. Oh, beautiful match. Beautiful match. Yeah. Love it. Yeah. It will be good. I'm looking for an opponent for Justin. And you know that Brett Grundy, do you know who I set against him? Kyle Hutchinson. And we will see. Nice match. Yeah. Good match.
Engin Terzi: Kyle is very strong. Brad really should be pulling 240s or even 225, I think, really. But he's very, very good. Kyle will be going down. The match is like 253 match. That's better. Yeah, that's good. This is how it is. What do you think about Corey West and Artem Morozov? They are going to pull very soon.
Devon Larratt: Yeah. Corey cannot be underestimated. Corey is dangerous. He's super dangerous. Super dangerous. He is such a strong human being. I think that if I had to bet on just round one, I'm going to bet Corey. I think Corey is going to come out and he's going to be incredibly strong.
Devon Larratt: incredibly strong that's what I think um can you win it can you win four it's gonna get very interesting and it's the world championship that's number one in the world left-handed right now um I uh it's a big deal uh I think it's a great match I think it's a close match I really do I think Corey West is extraordinarily strong like when I look at the two of them um
Devon Larratt: know artem is a very disciplined you know like he's like a terminator you know incredible arm wrestler cory west is quite unique there are not a lot of corey west's that are born he i mean he was 500 pounds when he was in high school this is a humongous human humongous man um who's just blessed with a lot of strength a lot of just raw strength um
Engin Terzi: yeah and he's getting better and better he hasn't even been arm wrestling that long so yeah i i'm very curious to see that match yeah and any okay i have a question for you who would you sense against iraqli who would i put against iraqli um you know what i sometimes think that what do you think about if michael can come healthy beautiful
Devon Larratt: That's a great match. Yeah, Michael. Yeah, right now, for Michael's comeback, it'll be interesting because we don't know where Michael's going to be. I'd actually like to see Michael do like a few smaller tournaments, you know, maybe something just to give him a couple of warm-ups before he... It's still very soon. I mean, he just had surgery. I think, you know, if we really care about Michael, we should probably give him a year.
Engin Terzi: yes yes but uh like if october is i said michael take your time you know he's already asking for matches in october no he's not asking but he's like like you're like checking me with me you know what do you think and i said michael you know if something in the same place same place happens you are going to probably yeah what about um i think i just saw somebody say chan shah and i know the weight category is a bit different
Devon Larratt: but that's that sounds interesting do you know the chance show i put with uh yeah now i'll tell you traditionally traditionally i mean when you look at chance he does very well against hook pullers which iraqli is not so i mean match up wise it might not be the best match up for chance but
Devon Larratt: If Chance is a little bit heavier, and if Chance has been training hard and his hand is getting good enough, it might not matter. I think the master will be like this, but Chance still can apply. If he has his pronative, he can still apply. I saw him. You remember with Rambet, one time he wanted to go there? He catch him here. Could be interesting.
Devon Larratt: chance chance versus iraqli could be could be interesting it's a big match for chance it's a big match yeah and sunday's versus pablo yes yes so initially i'll tell you so i got a chance to pull pablo this weekend and when i was first thinking about it i was like oh yeah pablo will beat sandras pablo's too strong um i worked with pablo
Engin Terzi: and i'll tell you that i do think that pablo is a little bit stronger but i think that's going to be a war and i think thunders is more technical not this perspective a little bit yeah a little more technical more power probably more horsepower yeah but control ability i think sunday is more you know yeah and i think that i think that sandras will will outlast
Devon Larratt: so it will be so so pablo would have to win can quite convincingly throughout which he's capable of i think it's a great match i think it's a very good match uh but i i at first i was like oh yeah pablo will kill him i'm not so sure i'm not so sure i think a good match very good match yeah yeah yeah and what do you think about about like uh dave schaefer versus they will not us
Devon Larratt: babe he can't even count to one i'm gonna murder him i'm telling you like uh i feel a bit bad for him because he's very strong and he's very good but i'm not the same he thinks that i'm the same guy i'm not the same guy like that was what was that 2019 or was it 18 18 or 19 the last three
Engin Terzi: What? This is a little personal, right? A little. Yeah, of course you can ask me. But it's a little personal, right? Okay. No, no, I mean you and Dave. Oh, it's Dave and I personal. Oh, I thought you were going to ask me a personal question. No, no, no. If I ask you a personal question, they won't be lying, you know. Here's the thing about Dave and I.
Devon Larratt: um we are really different we're very different people and i know that there's things about me that really bother dave they really do like he wouldn't have it's rare normally i kind of trash talk people it's very rare for actually this is not true anymore really a lot of people trash talk me but dave was one of the first they was one of the first dave called me out
Devon Larratt: and publicly kind of disrespected me in front of everybody remember remember the wal well i was following so much at those years you know well what did he say yeah so basically publicly without so i was we were all hanging out wal finals i was about to uh jeez i think i was about to arm wrestle uh oh who was it was either michael or
Devon Larratt: I think I was going to arm wrestle Michael or no, no, no. I don't even remember who I was going to arm wrestle. Anyways, I was in the finals and Dave is like, Dave, they're like, who do you want to arm wrestle? What's next year? And he's like,
Devon Larratt: the so-called face of the company, Devin Laird. I don't like him. I don't like the way arm wrestles. He doesn't know anything about sportsmanship. I guess they don't teach that kind of thing up there in Canada. He started first before you. He did it on television without even talking to me. He just went right out and I was like, oh, OK, I'm like, it was it was just to hype the match, you know, just like for. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: no i think he's got a problem all from the hearts you know just told you this look you don't see dave really doing that you don't see dave just maybe somebody said that you know just yeah that one just hype it already a little bit you know just say a few things you think like you would think that he would come and talk to me first i don't know i have no idea but i'm just saying that this guy did directly you before you said anything oh okay that's interesting and so then it got very heated
Devon Larratt: right it got very heated and i mean we've kind of made amends i thought but uh the truth is is we're very different it's very easy for us to fight each other very i mean what do you mean well he keeps people locked up that can't be good for your brain you know all day you know locking people up i mean that can't make you a happy person
Devon Larratt: oh okay just what you are saying yeah and i think he sees me and he sees someone that he'd like to lock up i think he sees me and he thinks that i belong in that jail that's what i think and i think did you see the photo that he also you know had luck you know oh yeah yeah yeah yeah i saw it i saw it for sure somebody sent him that and he just reposted it he didn't come up with that idea he came he came somebody somebody
Engin Terzi: posted, uh, commented under one or like whenever I shared Devon versus Dave and somebody made a comment, he made it the shop and I took that and sent to Dave and then he did. Do you, do you remember, um, that, uh, well, actually, did you know that the jail where he works, they had to, uh, change their security?
Devon Larratt: like they you they used to use all these different keys and these different codes and they got rid of all that now they just have a single swipe card just one swipe because dave couldn't remember which key to use and he was always screwing it up so now they just gave him a single swipe card so now he doesn't have to worry about that yeah
Devon Larratt: they changed the whole jail system because of dave and how dumb he is they just now dave just walks around with a single swipe card whenever he has to go through a gate or anything yeah used to be this key for that this code for this no for dave chafee swipe card swipe card swipe card yeah but you like doing this right you like doing this you like you like you like getting in his sense right eight there's nothing to get into hanging there's nothing to get into
Devon Larratt: He is the dumbest guy in all of pro arm wrestling. He is. Are you not afraid that he will destroy you and punish you? Why doesn't he join the chat right now? Somebody call up Dave Chief and tell him to get on here. Can he join up? Can he join this chat right now? I have no idea when we do these two people at the same time. I have done it.
Devon Larratt: only with dry months as far as i remember i i think you are the second person i don't know if we can invite three people i don't know it better be a simple process it better just be a click this button otherwise we don't even bother he is going to destroy you he's gonna he's destroying nothing he's destroying nothing the guy hang on why don't you ask
Devon Larratt: dave sometimes dave do you know how to play rummy no dave do you know how to play checkers no dave do you know how to play hide and seek no do you know how to play touch tag no he knows how to arm wrestle he doesn't even know how to arm wrestle he doesn't even know all dave knows is can i ask you something what what is your record against him when it mattered
Engin Terzi: victory victory but the truth is he beat you more than you beat him right ah these are these are details that that are inconsequential listen listen the guy is not here and now you are just smashing him with all those disrespectful words and i need to balance a little bit you know where is he tell him to call like if he's paying attention
Engin Terzi: I think that, you know, he will, he will prepare to stay away, you know, till the match, because you're going to make him, you're going to make him, you're going to make his blood pressure go up, you know, too much for him. Yeah. Jonathan, Jonathan Dutchman. Hey Devin, do you think you will go on Joe Rogan's podcast at some point? Imagine you would do a lot for the sport greetings from Oklahoma.
Devon Larratt: I think probably at some point we'll have arm wrestling on there. Yeah, for sure. I've met Joe Rogan. What a busy guy. What a busy guy. The truth is, is actually the longer we wait, the better it is for all of us. I think that, you know, everything is getting more popular right now, right? Everything is growing. Like all the pieces of arm wrestling are growing and developing and
Devon Larratt: And I know that when they are at a more full maturity, when we expose arm wrestling on these great big platforms, it's better if we show up and everything is ready and just be like, yeah, plug in here, here, here, here, here, here, here. Instead of like, oh, yeah, this is coming. We're almost done. This is coming. We're almost done. So the longer we wait, I think the better.
Devon Larratt: um like i'm not talking about weight forever i'm talking about you know if it happens next year or two that's that's fine and that's fine what are each of your favorite ways to train back pressure what's your way to favorite way to do back pressure you train big pressure except table then yeah for me it's it's with a belt i train with a belt i i wrap it around the knuckle
Devon Larratt: so for me so much the first step is keeping my knuckle high this is the first strength and then to develop the second part is uh is through pronation through the thumb with with a belt again but i balance it off with supination so really you have to be able to come up and then you want to be able to take the hand but you don't want to take the hand at a cost to exposing your arm to a flop so you need to be able to pull up like this as well so anything that keeps your hand high
Engin Terzi: and then spin to the thumb or high, and then connect with the body. Balance. Ivan posted, yeah, big boy. On top is reserved for Levan. Bigger dreams, bigger, no limits. Meaning, how do you both feel about Levan promoting his arms? He says that, yeah, big boy should be reserved for Levan. I think this is what he's saying.
Devon Larratt: sorry i didn't really understand that let me look yeah yeah the yeah big boy i think you need to say this oh yeah oh listen i'm going to be yeah big boying him all the time more i think it's going to be yeah medium-sized boy quite honestly i might even be bigger than him that day who knows that one when it matters a lot love you both that's true yeah what a good what a good guy yeah yeah
Devon Larratt: chess goals devon are you still playing chess cheers from minnesota i do play chess i'm not awesome at it i i like to play the five minute uh chess version i find that uh when i'm super smart which is not very smart at all in the chess world i play the five minute version and i get up to about a 1300 elo that's that's when i'm doing good uh about average for me is like 12 30 12 40 12 20.
Engin Terzi: and then when i get done i'll slip down to like 11 11 something you know um but normally i'm about a 12 12 30 12 40. can i can i tell you um or portray a nightmare uh possibility for dubai match you and dave yeah see this guy when you beat him
Engin Terzi: he stretched you like this and he was very close. And at that time you had like those two extra inches. I don't think you are the same Devon. You are not only like this, but you have like, okay, I'm not going to go there. You are not the same Devon, but technically, you know, the pads are like, you cannot go that two inches back. And so what I'm just saying,
Engin Terzi: If he brings you somehow with his side pressure to the same point, are you concerned about the way that he did transition against Vitaly Laletin? Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I see that. That's the only possibility that might become a nightmare for you.
Engin Terzi: right that floppers press that's very important if he stretches you and then suddenly put his shoulder and then that may be bad you know yeah i don't think you can do that right away but interesting yeah i i just i see a very funny comment devin the dave of chess that's very funny
Devon Larratt: yeah right there's devin the dave of chess and yeah no i know i'm a bad chess player i just love to do it i've never studied it i've never really trained it i play chess sometimes when i'm bored and to help me go to sleep and stuff i know i know i'm not a good chess player but i love it and i i'm like i'm like i'm like i am like a
Devon Larratt: like a bar arm wrestler, but in the chess world, like I'm a guy who, like, if I see you at a party, we talk about, oh yeah, I'll play, I'll play a game of chess, but, but I don't belong in a chess tournament. I don't belong. But still, still your, your hobby, your interest, your time is also showing that, you know, you like to use your brain, you know, it doesn't matter if you are great or not, you know?
Devon Larratt: I follow the sport of chess a little bit. Like I try and keep up on what's going on in the sport. I think those guys are super brilliant. I think that, you know how, when we think of arm wrestling, like it's fighting, but it's really like, I'd say that the best arm wrestler in the world, that guy's got the best fighting hands, the best fighting hands in the world, very likely belong to an arm wrestler. Like you take, you take a good arm wrestler and this guy has very dangerous hands on him.
Devon Larratt: um you take you take a chess player like a high level chess player that guy he can plan and he can see the future that that's a very special gift you know those chess players um very interesting yeah so you are you see that that possibility and you are like oh listen dave has not gotten very much possibility he's
Devon Larratt: the only possibility that he would have is if somehow bart was gonna be the referee if bart was the referee then maybe he has like a five or six percent chance that's it with bill comes as the ref or any neutral ref he doesn't have a chance got no chance got no chance i feel bad for him a little bit maybe he shouldn't even show up maybe he shouldn't would you show up if you were dave
Engin Terzi: Not even show up, right, Engin? I mean, if I was as big, as strong as Dave, I would beat the shit out of you. Yeah, but what about if you were, what about, Engin, if you were as dumb as Dave? You are terrible. You are terrible, you know? You are my good friend, but I will almost, I will almost hope the guy to beat you, but no, I will not, I will not. But you are just so mean.
Engin Terzi: well yeah he said so many mean things about me he is very very nice guy you know i have never seen anyone who doesn't like dave what about all the people he's got locked up but he's just applying the law you know i mean like application of law if he didn't do that someone else was gonna do it that's not his decision the law the law the guys something against the law
Engin Terzi: i don't know listen there may be a time and you and your family may need the law to protect you understand so we cannot be against that you know i don't know what they did the guy just doesn't even know what they did probably he knows it but he had nothing to do they said put them in jail but i'm just saying i'm sure that those people don't like him he doesn't like that
Engin Terzi: But do you think that if those criminals didn't like him, do you think that it is mostly because of his fault or their fault? I think that they don't like Dave because Dave's mean to them. I think Dave beats them up when he doesn't have to. That's what I think. He's a correction officer, right? I think so, yeah.
Engin Terzi: What kind of correctional officer you would be if you were one? You would be cool? I mess with them all the time. No, I'd just be like, I don't think I'd be a correctional officer. I don't think I could be. I don't think I have it in me. No. You would be just like buddies with them? I'd be fired. They'd fire me. I'd be fired. You would be too friendly with everyone?
Devon Larratt: Yeah, I'd bring them snacks. I'd bring them books. I'd try and... Arm wrestle them. Yeah. Freedom arm wrestling all the time. Yeah, yeah. I'd turn the place into a frat house. I'd try and make it a big party. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's talk about a few more things and then finish. What do you think about Vitaly versus Reva's match? Really good. Really good.
Engin Terzi: I see the matches going strapped. I don't see Rivas controlling Vitaly as he controls Dave. Do you think that Rivas can control him without a strap? No, I think it'll go strapped. I hold Vitaly so high, but Rivas' last performance, and when you look at what Rivas' hand is capable of,
Devon Larratt: it might get very interesting revas might be him revas might be too much um when i look at just their interaction with dave alone i mean you have to think that revas might be the favorite um but when you talk top roll for top roll uh it's gonna be tough to beat vitality it's a great test i mean if if revas can out top roll vitality then wow
Engin Terzi: then then the things are getting interesting huh yeah and then i think whoever wins that match is probably looking at hermes that's what i would think yeah do you think do you think that do you think that the winner of canada uh morozov match um why hermes maybe jerry is gonna be there maybe maybe you know what i will tell you something jerry
Engin Terzi: I see him. He's so huge. And I think he's coming here like his last man in the life. I think so too. I think it's going to be incredible. Because initially I was like, oh, Ermes is going to be too much. But there's some special energy. You see the danger, right? You see how big he's getting, how serious he's getting. You see how much ton, how many tons pressure he's going to put that way.
Devon Larratt: So if somehow Ermes gets out here, it's over. I think it's an incredible match. Stylistically...
Engin Terzi: nice match for jerry stylistically but ermys is just proving that he can do so many more things than we thought i mean initially ermys was looked at as a top roller i mean i think that when you watch any of the moments he can go to the shoulder pressure everything you know yeah the only thing that he should not be caught on his brachioradialis once he's caught on his brachioradialis from here so hard to survive but he can do something you know maybe at the center maybe
Devon Larratt: something I don't know what he's planning to do in fact we talk time to time he has some plans his own plans but Jerry also has some plans yeah well I think that everybody should know that if you are facing a guy who has an incredible floppers press you must train your supination you must train your low cup
Engin Terzi: you must train your cup a lot because you need to be able to pull them out. You can't have it be on tricep. You need to spin them. It's very important. Yeah, as I always say, like this now, your tricep is working the winning side. Once you turn your palm this way, now your tricep is working to your losing side. So this is all about controlling here. You don't control here, now he's here.
Engin Terzi: you control here now he's on his bicep if he wants to use his tricep he needs to use him to lose him he cannot use he can only use joint pressure and i don't think this will be so much pressure with us i mean this but we will see this is beautiful like i am people doesn't like the style of michael todd they don't like the style of jerry cadarez i dislike as well but
Engin Terzi: I mean, this is making everything more and more interesting. These are like challenges. It's like a computer game that every level you have someone different. Like we need to, in fact, tend to these unorthodox arm masters that making everything... Say, go ahead. I have two questions for you, Engin. Okay. I'm sure it will be very hard, but ask. First question. Do you consider switching to running fouls?
Engin Terzi: we need to discuss because because we need to like a guy who has advantage and the guy is like put in terrible position um while his opponent is doing a foul you can say that he can just
Engin Terzi: lose the match and restart or something but this is also confusion so i think we need to just talk a little bit it's possible but we need to make like best possible solution it's possible but we need to apply a little bit differently a little bit you know why would like i understand that the guy is winning and the other guy is just like fouling just like i understand this is unfair
Engin Terzi: we need to just continue the match so the guy can win. But when the guy is put in terrible position and the guy is going foul, so then you suggest the guy to foul so that he can restart? Well, that's the thing. I personally think that in the modern professional scene, the style of running fouls that the WAL used
Devon Larratt: is the optimum rule set for fouls mid-match that's what i believe sometimes the guy just gets advantage and then they pull like one minute and we know that the match is gonna start again you know like if this guy is winning but that's the person's choice it gives the choice to the athlete the athlete can like if we're arm wrestling and you get that big advantage
Engin Terzi: me at any point i can stop the match and you have the foul at any point you are saying that the guy who didn't foul has the choice and then yeah and then he can yeah so he needs to use this very smart as soon as possible it's his choice it puts the power in the athlete's hands
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but then again, and then the one goes, and then the one goes. There will be many restarts, I think. I can just lift my elbow and regain the position, and then he is in bad position, and then he will let it go, and then the match will start. But when you watch, and you're right, the guy could just go for the restart and could look the same way as fouls look right now. So that would be no change.
Devon Larratt: But if you look at leagues that have the running foul system, most athletes do not. Most athletes do not concede. I'd say it's probably around 20%. It's about 20% of them will go for the restart. Most of them will stick in the fight. I just wanted to know if you've been thinking about it. Another thing I'm thinking about, I want to share before you ask.
Engin Terzi: I want to go like really go.
Engin Terzi: I started hating, you understand? Of course, it's good for the WAF because everyone is strict. They cannot start. But for the professional, when the adrenaline and everything is just so high level and we can't be too strict with the rules because it doesn't help the popularity of the arm wrestling. So like whenever I stretch, I say, don't move. So this doesn't sound like ready. Don't move is a command that don't move, you know, nobody can start. I mean, even the meaning of the word, you know,
Engin Terzi: Don't already is like, you know, it's coming. It's more exciting, more like forcing you, like you're going to start, you're going to start, but don't move is just like, do not move. And then go, you know, I think we need to do this. And what was the second question? Sorry. Yeah. So it was along those lines. And, um, so it's definitely part of the question, but a transition and it's a small, it's a small change. It's subtle.
Engin Terzi: Um, but I, I think that in my opinion, it's better set grip versus referees grip. Do you ever consider switching? Okay. Okay. I, I, but I will tell you my opinion, but you don't get upset. Yeah. If 19 out of 20 matches, everything is fine with the reps grip. I think we need to focus what is wrong with that one match. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Engin Terzi: Now, do you see a lot of movement in the rest of it? Justin watch like Irakli versus Ongarbev match. Justin watch. Now you will see Morozov versus Gennady match. Justin look at the other matches. We don't have this problem. They will just go and re-watch all the matches. One out of 10 or 15 matches, you will have that kind of problem. Okay. Justin my honest opinion, you know. Okay, okay, okay. Now, but do you, have you ever arm wrestled in a set grip? Mm-hmm.
Engin Terzi: Okay, now I'll ask you about the referee's grip. Do you prefer to have your hand closed first or second? I mean, I heard the conversation, you and John, about this one. Do you think that if you just, I didn't check it, but if you go back and watch the matches,
Engin Terzi: Like you are telling me that the guy who closes his hand first is winning and the guy who is in close second is losing. It's my personal opinion that I am more comfortable when we talk referees grip to close. How about like this? How about like this? We close the hands and then referee goes this. Yeah, that's nice. That's better. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: you are saying that one squeezes the other's head and the other one is already crushed and then he cannot even close his hand good i mean i think we should maybe do a poll just to see if no no no i think we know in poll like i think that the people who are muscles actually need to decide this this kind of thing yeah i think that referee side side rep can hold the wrist make sure that the wrists are not bent and then the one guy just close this
Devon Larratt: And then he's going to say, don't move. And then the other guy can take his hand and then ready to go. Yeah. I mean, I don't think in a referee's grip, I don't think you ever need to say don't move because in a referee's grip, you can't move. Right. It should just be the referee is going to close the thumbs. He's going to close the hands and then it's go. That's what I think. No ready. No, don't move. The only thing is that like sometimes, you know, referee is just,
Engin Terzi: close and ready go, you know, just like, I mean, make sure that the hands are closed. Absolutely. Sometimes even before even close, ready go, you know, like, you understand, I want
Engin Terzi: athletes to know everything that that is coming you understand i don't want to oh i wasn't ready you know like how can you not be ready in a referee's grip and you should know that no no no no no what i just say that sometimes like close the finger and says ready go and then sometimes close really go you know like you understand what i mean like yeah like the hand needs to close
Engin Terzi: And then guys get the grip and then the goal needs to come. Not like, you know, as soon as the finger is touching and ready to go, you know, let the guy apply a little bit strength there because he cannot apply strength because it's a referee's grip. So let him, after you cover, let him a little bit put pressure there. And see, that's the difference between a set grip and a referee's grip. I believe in a referee's grip, you're really not allowed to really apply too much pressure at all.
Engin Terzi: but but in a set grip but you cannot move right so you can apply pressure here tight but you can't you can't do movement right yeah move this way i mean yeah everything is for good alarm missing nobody should have any pride like oh my my rule is like untouchable is super good you know like we can discuss and then we can improve yeah i agree yeah yeah yeah well anyways
Engin Terzi: good times yeah good times yeah yeah yeah i love it and and thank you for coming and and i will be at the uh corner of uh dave and then uh he's gonna need you he is gonna need you tell him to flop just tell him to go flop right away and stretch you you will be like this stuff and you'll be like yeah forget it
Engin Terzi: This band is so strong now. It's so strong. It's just going to... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. Listen, I tease you right now. You know, you 100% know that I tease you. But I don't even take the comments really. Oh, Inge really hates them. Inge really hates them.
Devon Larratt: Hey, good times, buddy. Hey, good luck in your last couple weeks. I'll see you in Dubai. Yeah, I wish you the best next week against Jordan. I also wish him the best. I mean, whoever is the other one, let him win, and then see you. If you have Dave on here, if you have Dave on here, work on his counting. Justin work on his counting. Get him to count. One, two, three, four. All he needs is four. Justin
Engin Terzi: Make sure he knows how to count to four and he might do okay. The guy is just going to be so angry. All he's got to know is how to count to four. I can imagine that at the press conference, he'd better take the blood pressure medicine even before. Because if I would be pulling you, I would be so angry. So angry. You know how to play.
Engin Terzi: People like me, we have a little bit thin skin because we are careful and we want people to be the same way. But Gennady, hey, listen, I think you owe Gennady a little apology, but I'm not gonna. Oh, what, for the dog thing? Yeah. Yeah, you guys are big on that dog thing, yeah. I didn't even hear when I was there. I don't hear. I didn't even hear when Jerry said, Engin. Hold on, hold on.
Engin Terzi: Oh, damn it. Okay. Hang on. I got to go. I got to go. Take care. Yeah. Talk soon. Yeah. Bye-bye. How do I leave here? There we go. X. Yeah. Okay, guys. Sorry. Did I miss any, any, any, any idea? I was going to read. I just couldn't find. Sorry. I apologize, my friend.
Engin Terzi: Devon, we need this storybook for Dave so I can sleep your best. And I can wait for the Ron Mick entrance. I will tell him this with your name by WhatsApp. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I apologize, my friend. I was ready to read this, but I couldn't just find into the conversation. I couldn't cut him and then say this. OK, guys, I hope you guys enjoyed.
Engin Terzi: um okay guys thank you thank you for everything and yeah about
Engin Terzi: Traveling to Istanbul. Also, I need to say that just check like lots East versus West. Most of the guys came from the East coast and many of them seven, eight, maximum nine hours direct flights, including Devon. And yes, some athletes like for Georgi is close. The Bulgarians come by also either car or bus or something.
Engin Terzi: They also, like, come with, like, near eight hours, nine hours drive. And Kazakhs come with plus five hours also flights here. But I bring the Western guys here. They arrive on Wednesday, and then the Eastern guys come here Thursday. At the beginning, I brought the Georgi guys even on Friday morning for, like,
Engin Terzi: first three events you know i think and so oh yeah hermes casparini will be uh my guest thursday two days later um yeah and john bersink will be my guest next week yeah thank you guys for watching and just get your pay-per-view and
Engin Terzi: and just don't miss dubai events let's see let's see what uh you know the you know i'm sharing the link here about canada i'm sorry about it what dave has to say i'm gonna invite dave here as well uh dave is probably getting upset with all those comments uh of
Engin Terzi: Devon is lucky that he doesn't speak English, that he doesn't really have to handle all this kind of pressure. Let's see how the match will be. Devon is probably the best thing that happened to our match, the best ambassador in my opinion.
Engin Terzi: Let's see how it will be. Justin guys watch and let's see how I will do against Coach Rey. By no means I underestimate him. No way. And I know
Engin Terzi: the eyes of people I look favourites, but your name, your career alone doesn't help you to win. You need to be ready to win the match. I'm sure that Rey is more ready than I am.
Engin Terzi: and but i am probably more experienced than him and we will see you know we will see i have respect for him there will be another great match morozov versus corey west corey is
Engin Terzi: I mean, incredible. He's incredibly strong and the guy is very young and he's improving. So is Morozov. And it will be another incredible match. If Corey was getting ready for these matches only by himself, then he wouldn't be as dangerous as he is now when he is getting coached by Michael Todd.
Engin Terzi: Michael Todd is one of the most knowledgeable guy in the support. And I think that is also making Corey extra dangerous, you know. So we will see. And then we will have Dave Sheffield versus Devon match. And a lot of people, they talk about this match when they pulled some years ago at the WAL, you know.
Engin Terzi: Many people didn't like how the match looked. And I think right now it is a little personal. And then we will see. I think both Dave and Devon have something to prove against each other. And we will see. We will see how it will be.
Engin Terzi: I just can't wait. I just can't wait to be there and compete and witness others do great matches. Anyways, guys, so I have all my tendons were made out of iron.
Engin Terzi: but they got so rusty. They got so rusty, my friends. Irish. Yeah. You know, bench press are missing difference. I think that not only about bench press, probably except Bronator, probably all
Engin Terzi: all raised numbers in gym probably better than mine right now but there is also something called coordination and that is gained by years of pulling at the world level and that and make difference i don't know if
Engin Terzi: John ever had any strength in the team better than the opponents that he has beaten them throughout years. So arm wrestling is a little bit different. Arm wrestling is a little bit different. Arm wrestling is about controlling the opponents and not allowing your opponent to control you. So that is a little bit different.
Engin Terzi: that is my advantage but there is no better technique than strength you know and if somebody is much stronger he is gonna beat you somehow and but if you really control him from if you
Engin Terzi: direction and then he may not be able to apply what he has so this is i mean you are strong when you can apply your power with you are not gonna be strong when you cannot apply just for example you do dumbbell row right and then you hold the bar from the balance point
Engin Terzi: And if you hold from this side more, and then you will fail from the little finger side. If you hold too much from this side, you will fail. The dumbbell will fall. So the same, you hold, you do bicep curls, right? You find the perfect, you know,
Engin Terzi: middle point, you know, to lift. If you hold so much from this side, the dumbbell will fall this way. If you hold so much from this side, dumbbell will, you won't be able to lift it. So that is the same with harnessing. The application of strength to some points can enable you to apply your power. So it's a very deep subject. You can write an encyclopedia about all these things when you really need to
Engin Terzi: yourself in a room and then write everything you experience, you know, throughout your career. But for me, it's not possible right now. When I'm organizing East versus West, when I'm training, I have a couple of students only. And when I'm training myself, it's not possible. Like I need to go to a farmhouse and then stay there for a few months. And then maybe I can
Engin Terzi: bring something good, if my memory helps me to remember everything, you know. But some things in arm wrestling, you don't think, but you just apply. You, you, how to say, there are things that your brain can think in like less than a second.
Engin Terzi: you need to write a page about it you understand to explain the same thing so also the information is not static information is dynamic like you cannot really teach someone like everything some things needs to be experienced by pulling different opponents at different levels you know you need to know how
Engin Terzi: and those deep shoulder pressure, Kazakh guys pull, Bulgarians pull. I mean, you need to pull many different, so you need to know what to do, you know, at that point. You need to look at the setup of an opponent. You need to know the opponent already before the match as well. But the opponent can do something different in a moment, you know. He can feel something and he can switch to something else. You need to realize that too and you need to counter that too.
Engin Terzi: these are not like static static information you know you need to really feel and act it's so hard to write all this in a book and learn everything there are basics a lot of basics you can write the rest is about experience you need to pull as much as possible you know especially at the high level anyways guys thank you very much there are still 367
Engin Terzi: Dennis will beat Devon Engin. Ah, I'm not sure about that. I'm not sure about the way that, the way that Devon, Dennis pull. Devon is, I don't know. Dennis beat Devon more like a hook with left arm. With right arm, it is a different story for Devon. The way Devon pulls,
Engin Terzi: And I think Devon is much stronger compared to that time. I'm not sure if Dennis will be at the same exact level at his prime. I don't know. Maybe he will, maybe he will not. But the way that he is pulling right now, the way that Dennis is pulling is Devon's game. It's Devon's game. And I really don't think it will be easy match. Some people are saying, oh, Dennis is going to destroy Devon or something.
Engin Terzi: just try to remember round one, Gennady and Devon. You may say, why do we remember round one, but not another round? It is because it is just, I just want you to understand that when, like Devon, like the way Devon was forced to pull inside against Gennady because of Gennady's, that flop risk hit. I don't think that Dennis is going to,
Engin Terzi: do the same. So, they both will apply their A games. So, Devin didn't go for open arm top roll against Gennady because Gennady's the flop hit, you know. So, he was afraid that he couldn't put his elbow on the bat. Dennis is not capable of doing that. Dennis is going to go for open arm top roll and it's going to give a lot of room for Devin. So, I'm not saying Devin is going to win.
Engin Terzi: But Devon will be very comfortable going against Dennis. He will apply everything as he plans. He will not have to switch to something else. So I think that it would be an incredible, incredible match. I just can't wait. I just can't wait. It would be incredible.
Engin Terzi: And you will be great to see you pull jumpers again. No, my friends, no, my friends. I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm far away. You know, I'm, when I pulled John, I was 20 kilo lighter than him. And I just had bicep tear some months ago and maybe eight, nine months ago, probably. And I just had COVID, but even.
Engin Terzi: None of this happened, so there is nothing I could just give him a better match, but the result wouldn't change. I don't even know if I can continue arm wrestling. I don't know about my bicep. I really don't know how much, when I had the stem cells, the doctor said only the inner bicep, 80% was torn and only 20% was holding.
Engin Terzi: i think the outside of the bicep needs to get stronger so that it can hold you know it can support but i don't know if it is going to change my um my pulling style you will see i'm experiencing something is not like as it used to be uh with my performance i'm not bad
Engin Terzi: But we will see. We will see how it will be. But let's see. Let's see how it will be. Yeah, Timmy, you are right. It's very unpredictable, you know. Justin like, look at Devon and Gennady. I know the majority are Devon fans and they are upset. And I understand that and I respect. But if you look at the beauty of our mess thing,
Engin Terzi: Like, I mean, it was a chess game. It was incredible, you know. It was incredible. Like, to watch that match mentally tired me. Mentally, there was incredible two athletes with decades of experience and knowledge. They just clashed, you know. They clashed, you know. They clashed the intelligence, the heart, the spirit.
Engin Terzi: and the strength and the endurance like it was incredible like for me it's just like a i don't know i don't know it was just like i love this i love this thank you the bell development sorry my princess for my pronunciation yes guys thank you
Engin Terzi: Thank you, Paul Strang. Thank you. Thank you, xMinecraft. Do you remember how many people called Morozov vs. Steffi Mismatch because everyone thought they would win? Yeah, almost. Yeah. It's beautiful. Not because Morozov won. It's beautiful that we have all these new guys, not only the Eastern guys that are just becoming stars, but like some of the
Engin Terzi: Like now we have Justin Hayat, you know, I'm very happy that, you know, I will, every guy that is giving hopes, I will do my best to promote these guys. Oh, of course, you say that, like, you should promote everyone, but like, listen, I really am limited, my friends. I do my best and we will see, we will see. The next date,
Engin Terzi: East versus West mark is July 29th, and then we have August 26th. But we have on June 24th, we have single the table. It will be also incredible. Incredible. JR Williams. I don't, I'm not sure if Dennis has more endurance than Devon.
Engin Terzi: Gennady had more endurance than Devon in the game that they played. But outside the game, I think Devon still has the best endurance. But who knows. John Edwards, thank you for your support, my friend. Thank you. Thank you, John Edwards. Thank you, my friend. Yeah. Thank you, Mark.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, it's incredible. And I don't know, I'm trying to set all these matches. Normally I was going to set six matches for the qualification winners because six qualification winners from East and six from West. So I was going to set them each other, but I prepared to set 12 matches instead of six matches because I want a better matchup for everyone. You understand? Like more...
Engin Terzi: fitting more like stylistically and everything you know i i want a better match so i do my best and you guys support me and hopefully hopefully you know the things will grow everything will be better um ah you never be sure about me crashing ray or something
Engin Terzi: You may be disappointed. I did my best. I'm sure doing my best looks like I need a little bit more rest because I had very little time and I had to train so much. I did, but it's kind of a little bit gave me pain and so I need a little bit more healing.
Engin Terzi: now we have 18 days today i did like maybe 50 to 70 percent blood pumping you know with with a little bit finger and a little bit wet and a little bit bicep and i think i won't do any more uh table but i may do maybe one more zero straining maybe not but
Engin Terzi: plan is one chest training chest tricep and then maybe a pull-up and then full rest yeah guys so please continue supporting us by the way 11 second actually will be our special guest and he will have his trading card as well signed trading card he will be signing
Engin Terzi: and so just make sure every time we do the trading card guys at the end like it and it finishes like a week ago or a little bit more and then people ask for more and then oh did it and then they they send me a message they say oh we would even pay more uh but um it finishes so if you are interested um just thank you for the odds
Engin Terzi: Thank you. Thank you, my friend. Guys, I'm not going to Dubai for losing. I just don't want to talk big. I'm not going there to lose. I really don't know where I am. Seriously, I really don't know where I am. But I'm not going there to lose. It doesn't mean I'm going to win. And if possible, I want to do more matches at the higher level.
Engin Terzi: Oh, next week I will talk with John. We talked already. He said this week I'm not available, but next week he's going to tell me exactly whenever he's available and I will have a nice podcast with him, hopefully. Yeah, most likely. Get your paper ready if he just shares. And
Engin Terzi: okay guys if you don't have any any questions then i go um yeah the spelling listen i really don't know listen after the spelling i pulled you on and after that time till today like many many many months i didn't even train guys many months i didn't train so
Engin Terzi: Like, I'm not young. He's coming very slowly to back. So don't expect me to be as good. And I think that time, Ray wasn't in good shape. And I don't know if he pulled anyone before I did, before he pulled with me. So it is just hard to judge by that training.
Engin Terzi: Is all the training already done? Are you resting until... Yeah, serious training finished, Timmy. Serious training most likely finished. Because today I did some bicep training. So I could do only 50%. I felt like I felt some pain inside of my elbow and a little bit on brachialis. And I'm like, better not. So just because I don't push my limits, it doesn't mean I'm not strong. I don't need to really push my limits, you know.
Engin Terzi: um to know that i am strong you understand you do 50 because the arm wants that you know if you are hurt then that is not that you need to train at your limits if your arm is frozen it means that you can apply everything you have so to be able to apply everything you have first you need to heal that
Engin Terzi: and so for me is healing time for me right now healing means getting stronger pushing limits and being hurt trying to push the limits it will only go back the injury will be water and i won't be able to perform so i need i must not panic mark siku guerra thank you for your super sets thank you my friend thank you for support you go over the tentative matches so far for this
Engin Terzi: all the intensity matches so far what's the word mean my content like i really don't know sorry for my english i mean your forearm muscles are i mean working together with your wrist tendons
Engin Terzi: Copping ability is just a whole big subject. Everything starts, you know, like so many things involved in my practice. Oh, you want me to tell you the matches from East versus West? 9 and 10. 10 is only, I mean, Devon, you know, Devon versus Dennis, and then Matt versus...
Engin Terzi: Gasparini, Lamparelli, Frank Lamparelli. No, I didn't use the handles. I still don't use the handles. I prefer plain wood with the belt, you know, better than any of those rolling handles, you know. I don't find them useful for armors. It's totally...
Engin Terzi: different feeling you know most important is the beginning like beginning position of harnessing this static positions both from this way and this way
Engin Terzi: And you can do the rest. You can do your attacking. I have no idea about Rubin. Ah, Matt Mask looked great, but it was not surprising. Wasn't surprised. Anyways, guys, I go away. I thank you very much for joining us. And hope to see you two days later. Dermot Gasparini.
Engin Terzi: gladiator will be my guest and looks like we're gonna have a good time as always the guy just laughs laughs laughs he has the best laughing you know in the community as far as i know so you all take care yourself and just keep supporting east versus west so i can serve you more and you all take care and
Engin Terzi: Stay strong.
