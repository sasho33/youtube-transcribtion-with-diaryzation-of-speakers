Engin Terzi: Thank you. Thank you, Phil. So very, very busy days, very busy days. East versus West seven, and then I was concentrating on my own competition, then go Moldova as a technical director of the Turkish team, then go Dubai, compete king of the table, come back and just
Engin Terzi: you know, just like, Engin, call strength. Engin, you are the man. Thank you for everything you do and supporting Zurab as well. My friend, I wanted to, I wanted to like start the GoFundMe. Hello, hello. Hi. How are you, Elizabeth? This is the first time we met. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, your arms, everything is even bigger than how they are in pictures. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if the videos and pictures show very well, but. Yeah, you seem to be ready. I'm ready. Yeah. So how is everything? No injury. Everything is good. Training is good.
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: Yeah, I'm actually feeling the strongest I have in a while I was actually feeling kind of hurt and sore during the finals but everything's kind of healed up. And I definitely wasn't feeling my best going into that so
Engin Terzi: So, so are you, are you excited or nervous that this will be your first international and then it's just like highest level event? And how do you, how do you feel? What, what, what kind of feeling do you have? Are you like, I'm just excited. Justin really excited. Excited. Yeah. Yeah. But you are also like confident.
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: yeah i mean uh i never surprised myself every time so like recently i've been surprising myself with it to turn out and how things are happening so never know i could just you know take it off so yeah yeah and so it will be great you know it will be great that um
Engin Terzi: my intention to organize this event to just bring the best of east and best of west and meet each other because we are one world you know it's not good when we are uh divided and so it will be good in in the past there has been great female arm masters from us and canada
Engin Terzi: lately still very good ones but you know we like are you do you have like dreams to just become the number one in the world like do you like are you that passionate or you just come you are okay that's good that's right yeah yeah that's what i wanted to hear yeah
Engin Terzi: because because it is i mean like when i started arm wrestling like my motivation was like there shouldn't be anyone who is breathing and beat him in arm wrestling like it cannot be possible you know just like i need to beat at least everyone at my weight category so if you have this kind of dream then i i think that you will only get better and better yeah for sure
Engin Terzi: take it one step at a time though yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this is first step your opponent is around 65 you know 143 she will be and she is european champion from the past and she is very
Engin Terzi: I'm 100% sure and you know that she can pull forever and like long matches um what are you concentrated like you concentrated like like you are concentrating like destroying her or are you also ready for a war
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: My main concern is just getting her to the pad as quickly as possible because I've seen her endurance. That being said, I mean, I could be wrong, but if she does slip and we go to a strap, the war better be out of the strap because there's not going to be a war in the strap. So you are planning to finish the match without the strap? I'm saying if she wants to have a war, her best case is out of the strap.
Engin Terzi: oh okay so you are saying that's your favorite yeah oh okay okay okay i understand yeah i understand yeah yeah also you are you are okay what i understand from what you said that you
Engin Terzi: your mind you are stronger than her and there is only one way her to have a war against you is without the strap and once the strap is on you believe in your strength and you are saying there is no way that you're gonna lose yeah okay that's that's good mindset
Engin Terzi: It's a good mindset. Let's see what she's thinking. She soon will come in three minutes. And let's see what is her, where her mental preparation is at, you know, and then we will understand. And you are going to be 154 pounds, correct?
Engin Terzi: yeah okay is it is it like how like what is your weight are you gonna need to cut a little weight or you're around just a little bit a little bit not much yeah okay that's good so you are saying that you will be able to carry your form to the competition you won't be really killing yourself okay oh i'm gonna be full strength yeah
Engin Terzi: yeah okay that's good that's good that's good we will see we will see you know i i know carolina she's also a warrior hello carolina hello i just heard you said oh my god and then
Carolina Pettersson: was it an impression yes it was the impression of you guys i was scared at the second when i saw elizabeth i was like oh my god i'm oh my god oh my god she's so big or what yeah exactly no oh you shouldn't say that i'm just kidding i'm just kidding yeah okay okay
Engin Terzi: You better be kidding. Yeah. And you are also from your face. I understand that you also gained some weight a little bit, huh? From my face. Yeah. No, no, no. Like you can say that I say him for everyone. I mean, it's the only thing I see. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. No, it's true. It's correct. I have gained some weight, so. Yeah. So Carolina, um, what, how, how is your shape?
Carolina Pettersson: very good yes it's good i feel i feel strong i i have done some competitions here in sweden like smaller competitions and i i feel i feel powerful i feel explosive and i feel strong i feel like my endurance is good training is going good so i feel really well yeah and and do you see this as an opportunity for yourself
Carolina Pettersson: Yeah. For future matches? Sorry, for? For the future matches. Yeah, yeah. That's correct. I see it as a big opportunity and it's also very fun to like get to pull you, Elizabeth, someone who is from the United States and maybe hasn't competed as much internationally. So it's like a new kind of challenge and yeah.
Engin Terzi: I think it will be a challenge for you physically, while it will be a challenge for her experience-wise. This is how I see it. I am sure that she also has her own experience, but I remember you have been pulling for almost 15 years. I remember you from 2009 Bulgaria. You were a junior puller. I remember. I don't know if you pulled anything before that at the international level.
Carolina Pettersson: uh i started internationally 2008 i think in norway it was the european championships oh you were in norway too yeah yeah and i was a junior and i i took a goal there so so that's uh when i started and then yeah bulgaria and then went up to seniors and
Engin Terzi: few years after that so yeah i've been i've been pulling for a long time yeah and she did as an opportunity you she has an opportunity will you allow her to stand on your way between your dreams and yourself uh no am i am i being provocative no no no no um no i think that
Carolina Pettersson: As you said, like Elizabeth, I have seen her, of course. I've looked at her training videos and armwrestling videos, and she seems very powerful. I understand that she has a lot of power, but you are newer in the sport and has less experience. And of course, when you come to armwrestling and you have a lot of power, but not a lot of experience,
Carolina Pettersson: It takes time to transfer your strength into the table, right? Yeah. So I think that my experience will still be enough. And then you will bring it to the match. Do you think that her horsepower
Engin Terzi: maybe more than yours but somehow you may just stop and bring the match to somewhere that endurance will play a role experience will play a role this is a strategy or do you think that there is a possibility that you may even dominate her but let's just tell us honestly tell us honestly what's on your mind here uh i think that she has
Carolina Pettersson: uh like better or greater horse power but i think that like when you talk about power sometimes when you talk about power it's more like you know this uh this quick pressure pressure yeah like yeah okay but i'm thinking like it's also important like how how much um power you can apply in a short time
Carolina Pettersson: right so that's one thing so lifting like a heavy weight like five six times is something but lifting a weight like that explosively one time that's another thing you are saying that her zero to 60 is good but what if becomes a 10 kilometer running you know sorry i don't i don't
Engin Terzi: no no what i'm just saying that maybe like you know there is like a 100 meter 100 meter running yeah and then there is 400 there is 5 000 you know so do you plan to bring the game to the like a little bit longer race uh the thing is that uh i or you can pass 100 meter as well
Carolina Pettersson: um i think if i if i can like get control then i think that i i will i can do like both maybe that's my that's what i what what i am what my focus is on or my mentality that i am trying to have you know but um
Carolina Pettersson: um it depends on on many things like how good is her wrist and because of course she has she has the power but where is the power etc
Engin Terzi: yeah what i realized that we have been chatting for i think we start to chat with her five minutes uh before you came and what what i realized that you ladies are how to say more open than the guys that i am chatting from like compared to most of them and but also a little bit shy to express yourself to not uh offend i think it's because of respect that you guys say for each other
Engin Terzi: And she also said before, I'm talking with you right now more because before you came, we talked with her like five minutes. I will again go to her and ask her opinion. But she said, she said that is only if I didn't misunderstand. But she said the only way to become a war endurance game is out of strap. Once it is in strap,
Carolina Pettersson: all over do you agree with that uh i i understand that she's meaning that if we get into this trap she will she will i will have no like chance is that what you're saying this this is yeah i think everyone has a plan you know of course yeah you cannot blame anyone they're having no you have your own plans as well you know it's not like this is where we're standing and so uh
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: Do you by that consider yourself stronger in the strap? I was just, what I meant when I was saying that was that if it's going to be a long drawn out hour long war, I don't think it's going to be in a strap. You know, it's probably going to be like your hand control and the way that you naturally pull. I have, from what I have seen, I am thinking that we might not be going to the strap.
Engin Terzi: at all because you seem to be a puller who would like to hold on maybe that is incorrect but that that is how i saw when she was doing the finals yeah the east versus was final she was you know she didn't let the opener she was holding on you know yeah but but she says that probably she won't be even that nice once it's in strap yeah okay we'll see
Engin Terzi: yeah anyway so uh i'm i'm excited it's good that you know we have we should have more matches i think uh before the end of the year we will have for sure the revenge match the rematch of gabriella and barbara they will be you know as of now they look like you know
Engin Terzi: two best. And there is one super chat. How is Zurab doing? Engin, are you planning to make a podcast with him? Yeah, we can do it. Thank you for your super chat. I started a GoFundMe for Zurab, but over here in my country, Turkey, we don't have GoFundMe. So I asked my good friend, Joshua Justin Grant, and he started today.
Engin Terzi: and and then we will do our best and uh because i will directly see zurab he will come to the east versus west nine i already bought his ticket when he came you know uh because i can directly support him so i didn't donate to there so i mentioned it and this is not to just show up or something but it is just to be good example i didn't want people to saying and you start off on me
Engin Terzi: but we don't see you donating there so i didn't want to look like hippocrats so that that's why i did but some people just took it in the wrong way you know anyway so um haven't seen elizabeth pool what is her strongest attack lane how would you answer this elizabeth i i saw like outside side pressure but with pronation but how is it you would know better than we do
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: Or maybe we should ask Carolina. I'm sure that she has been studying a lot. Honestly, Carolina would probably be able to answer that better than me. So my lane is where I feel comfortable. I mean, I don't think I have a direct line of attack at this point. Yeah. So you can go even inside. Have you ever pulled inside as well? Yeah, but a lot of American girls, they don't really like to pull inside.
Engin Terzi: Baba, but do you ever force anyone going inside? Because women, the creation of the wrist is not like men's. So that is like we see a lot of women pulling finger to finger. And so, but there are some that are using really good wrist control, but
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: Like, if somebody goes inside with you, you can pull in hook as well, huh? Yeah, like, it'll just, like, sometimes, like, I know Nadia, she likes to pull inside sometimes with me. Lately, she hasn't since our Keystone match, so she doesn't go inside anymore. But, like, Daniel, I don't know if you're familiar with her, Evanston, she goes inside a lot. And Carolina, is that...
Carolina Pettersson: What do you expect from Elizabeth? Good pronator control, back pressure, finger control, and side pressure. What do you expect? I expect like, I expect her to go a lot side. Yeah. And to use, because I think that maybe the technique isn't like super developed to go
Carolina Pettersson: like to combine everything and maybe put the side, put the back pressure, put everything on at once. And I expect that it will be more like a bit mechanical, like maybe side, a lot of like power sideways. And so that is what I will have to work around.
Engin Terzi: I kind of think about Elizabeth because she's not like, like she can still be considered as new, you know. I don't know, how long have you been pulling Elizabeth? Justin going on two years in September. Oh, two years only.
Engin Terzi: yeah so you are very new but so did the dangerous part about uh being such a new puller and being so strong is just like that they can be very dangerous because more she transfers her power to the table i mean every day every day every day every day she will be more dangerous because she is still i'm sure that in a learning process two years is very new and and how tall are you ladies
Engin Terzi: I know currently you must be minimum 165. 166. 66. Okay. And you? Those of us. I don't know what that is. So I'm 53. 53. You are about very near to 160. Okay. You are 53 and then you are 55. I think currently it's about 55 here. About here.
Carolina Pettersson: so yeah that's what i have seen in in her videos as well that like you you have done it seems like you have done a quite a quick um like um progress yeah progress in arm wrestling and that the technique has gotten a lot better and obviously like you won the qualifications and there were like great names in the qualifications
Carolina Pettersson: uh so so obviously you have like a lot of uh a lot of power transfer to the table as well uh but i agree with engine that like it you will continue to do progress over over a long time so she kind of reminds me pauline
Engin Terzi: Pauline was also like, wasn't like so many years pulling. Of course he has been pulling some years, but still you cannot say like forever he has been pulling. And then he just came to East versus West and he just did incredible progress because he was strong. And every time I saw him,
Engin Terzi: i realized that he was better than last time you know so i kind of see the same potential with elizabeth a female version you know and then i think that she will be a force and i see that she is taking very seriously i see you ladies both are just you make one video and she makes one video you make one video i wish
Engin Terzi: most of those guys were as professional as you ladies seriously like you guys are really promoting your event better than many of them sorry guys forgive me but these ladies are doing better job you know we we also want to like show appreciation and I think that we are both like very grateful for the opportunity because it's not the same with as with the guys because they get
Engin Terzi: more opportunities if i can say so but it was a start for everyone too i think that this is opportunity everywhere not because it's this first quest but it is really high level you know so it is good that you know because you go there i mean what i want our masters to do that then i want them to promote themselves so when they have like
Engin Terzi: bigger following then trust me they will be invited more and more and more you know of course they need to be successful as well but this is how we will grow not like the event promotion alone is not gonna work they need to really like look at brandon assessor he is also all the time sharing his trainings and everything falling regularly like they are like
Engin Terzi: this is what i do you understand not like showing you know from event to event hey i came i compete and i go but it's just like this is what i do today this is how i progress this is what i do this is my goal this is how devon became the greatest ambassador
Engin Terzi: the history of arm wrestling that's how it is because it is not only about arm wrestling but it's also people wants to uh get to know the person his dreams what he's doing yeah they want to know the personality but that is why i want athletes to really promote themselves to become a brand you know yeah yeah
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: That's actually what I've been kind of like when you said that I posted a video and she posted a video. Some of those videos I don't think are always intentional because I post every day.
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: that's a goal i i think i post at least one video a day on my at least on my news story and then i think that because of the promotion it started posting it feels each other you know you you do and then you know i said oh it's kind of online
Engin Terzi: I just want to provoke her. And then she goes like, don't worry about me, you know, like this. And, but, but, you know, so it is, it's how it should be. You know, it's very good. Very good. Yeah. Yeah. But I think that, as you said, Elizabeth, I think you post more videos. It just proves that you are training harder than her. See now she's going to get angry at me. No, no, no. I'm just trying to provoke her, you know.
Engin Terzi: yeah okay you will see a lot of videos from me from now on oh okay okay okay okay yeah let's see let's see how it will be yeah the woman competition yeah
Engin Terzi: sometimes very tough very tough let's see let's see how it will be and I just I just can't wait for the press conference as well I don't know if it will be like more likely you know hey I came here to beat you there are my dreams and you are on right on my way you know I will not allow that or I respect her so much you know I hope the better one wins and this and this we will see how it will be yeah how do you ladies think that it will be
Carolina Pettersson: I think that both me and Elizabeth are very determined. I see it that way. And I think that... I think that we both want to win and that we will show it. But we might still be professional and diplomatic about it. Or what do you think?
Engin Terzi: There is a way to be respectful and also show your determination. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can express even your issue, your dreams respectfully. Yeah, I understand you. Yeah, you're right. Andrei is saying, Engin, if there is a stop, if the man stops, they will be pulling till the morning. Are you ready for that? I think he is addressing you, Carolina.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I think, I think, I think, yeah, I think, I think that that, that is because of your recent super matches, because I don't think that, I don't think that Elizabeth is there like 10 minutes long matches. Why are you doing that? The thing, it's very interesting because I used to be like very explosive puller. And now these matches seem to always go down to endurance. I don't know.
Carolina Pettersson: Why, but I hope it won't be that way when we meet, but we'll see.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, from one side, you said that you hope that he will not be like that. But from one side, I mean, as long as like you win or she wins, it doesn't matter. A long match is always like more like this is arm wrestling, you know? Yeah, actually. Yeah, to do that at the really high level stage is even much more impressive because this time more eyes will be watching.
Carolina Pettersson: yeah and the thing is like when you have these matches you have so much time to think uh and that is quite nice actually because you you have time to make like corrections and the other one makes corrections and you have time to uh like change your feet standing and all of that you can you can do whatever you want because nothing will be over like in one split second because it's
Engin Terzi: we're both tired and there's not a lot going on elizabeth said that you know she doesn't have only a dream to beat you elizabeth said she wants to become the best in the world and this is very like respectable you know just uh targets and but question i don't know are you gonna allow her uh no not right now okay not not not never
Carolina Pettersson: uh i i plan to i i plan to win this match and i think that i will and and i i'm not like i can never go maybe as heavy in body weight as elizabeth will be able to do so maybe she will in the future have greater opportunity to like
Engin Terzi: be be the best in the world i don't know if that is a goal like overall you are saying that she may become someday and you wish her best but not now yeah not on july 29 okay and elizabeth you you just quite listen to her and she says she expresses like inside of you you say okay i will show you at stable that kind of feeling you have or i mean in the past uh
Engin Terzi: I just know I just know I know where my mindset is and it's not going to change no matter what she says so it's all right yeah that's good that's good that's confidence you know so you are basically saying that I let her the talking uh parts and I will be doing the the action the action part
Engin Terzi: yeah see i i i get what i want i tried to steer the pot but still brought to that point you know without any disrespect and tripboard thank you for your super who do they want to get as their next opponent um i'm focused on this match if if you beat her if you beat carolina
Engin Terzi: like do you want something really really really really big or you want to go step by step like i mean if you beat carolina you want to pull someone like fiat isaac or or engine maybe not next time but her time will come yeah baby steps but also is let me finish let me focus on this match
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: okay okay because this is super chat i have to ask you know sorry she's i i i have all the respect for for her i mean is this is not this is not oh i'm gonna beat her and then go on to the next one i need to focus on her yeah okay oh but you realize that it's not my question it's super chat yeah no no no i know i know okay
Carolina Pettersson: and same question to you carolina the kind of the question is east versus west category starts from 70. first of all do you think it is too high yeah that's the that's the that's what i will have to like evaluate now i think uh for myself i mean because uh previously i have been pulling 55 and then i have been pulling 60
Carolina Pettersson: and now i have been gaining weight at and you will be 65 yeah to to pull with elizabeth and i don't know if if that weight would work fine for me i will see what will happen after this but but i normally like i compare myself mostly to the 60 kilo girls and around and like i have
Carolina Pettersson: i have many people in that category that i would like to like super matches with yeah yeah especially the people that i haven't met like estra or dimitrina i would like to someday like are you planning to go kazakhstan for the wars yeah yeah okay then you will have your chances there yeah yeah that's true yeah um i will i will be pulling most of those girls there i guess
Engin Terzi: um but yeah we'll we'll see about the weight yeah chance show says hello hello ladies hello chance yeah and so do you
Carolina Pettersson: Ladies follow also the male armwrestling or so much focused on female armwrestling? I mostly follow female armwrestling, but I think I have some insight. I do follow men's armwrestling as well. Like, for example, do you know that I'm an armwrestler as well?
Engin Terzi: i'm joking no no i didn't know that yeah ah used to be used to be yeah okay yeah and elizabeth do you follow mail armesting do you follow like those guys like ermes morozov devon john kaka shins pauline a little bit i just started more so the last couple of months but you know as a new puller
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: I'm just getting into the world a little bit, so.
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: okay yeah i i kind of like the answer like it is what the male arm wrestling deserves they don't pay attention to the female arm wrestling and this is what they get back you know okay i pay attention i pay attention to like the guys that i know like in the united states mostly i maybe follow a couple of the european arm wrestlers on like instagram but like yeah i'm not i'm not following like their form and
Engin Terzi: what they're lifting and how... But do you follow them to learn more? Of course, yeah. I mean... Who is your favorite arm master? Me? Yeah. Is it a male or female? That's hard. You gotta have a male and a female. You can't... Okay. That's difficult.
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: What did you say? That's difficult to pick one or the other, right? Yeah, yeah. You always have a favorite. And then, yeah, the minimal. Michelle Dugan was my favorite for a while. I like the way that she carries herself. Yeah. Yeah. So you basically, you basically pull against your favorite armors at the East versus West finals. I did. And that was very hard for me.
Engin Terzi: okay and and male are missing the the uh i would say pigeon transformation yeah wow you don't follow the current arm masters but you watched all the videos apparently yeah okay okay and you carolina male and female like let me guess let me guess like how about heidi you think she used to be your
Carolina Pettersson: favorite or uh the thing is okay okay heidi uh i admire her a lot because she has done a lot of of the good things for the sport she has been like poster name for sweden and that is why we have such an interest from swedish girls to poke and um
Carolina Pettersson: sorry there was some lightning you know thunder outside so i was like yeah and she's one of those a few that has wins against makeo right yeah yeah i remember that they're they're only like a few a few times makeo lost and one of them against uh heidi yeah it was um really really amazing and she's she is an amazing puller and has done a lot of amazing things and it's uh
Carolina Pettersson: a bit sad that she doesn't pull anymore but also i i really like um like her cousin fia uh they're cousins maybe all of you didn't know that but uh because i think she's very like uh admirable and respectful and also she's like has so much power
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah almost almost all of the girls from sweden are just like you know like i sometimes think that like like not sometimes but the female armistice at the world level
Engin Terzi: is performing better than the male arm masters from sweden and i'm just thinking that maybe you you ladies are too dominant in the making the guys are just like not feeling masculine enough or what okay i don't know if that's the case but but i do agree that like the females are more uh successful probably
Carolina Pettersson: because the Sedis national team did win the best team at Worlds last year. So it's a successful team and you can pick any girl from Sweden and you will know that she will be doing a great match and that she's a good player. Yeah, yeah. White things, you know.
Engin Terzi: Female players from Sweden are just like up there. If you would just mention a few countries, one of them are for Sweden. And we don't really have any team from Western Europe we can consider in being as good as a female team from Sweden. But do you know any team from the Western side? I'm not talking about female, even the male.
Engin Terzi: The only dominant ones are from Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Georgi, Russia, Turkey. And then you talk about suddenly girls from Sweden. This is how it is. I don't know. Am I imagining? I mean, this is what it is. I have never thought of it that way, but it seems to be true. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Carolina Pettersson: Yeah, I believe that it will continue to be that way. Okay. Who's your, who's your favorite male armwrestler? I have like many people that I, that I enjoy watching like a lot, like Devon and, uh, also Johnny's and, uh, uh, on goodbye. Oh yeah. And, um, uh, I also think that you are a great arm wrestler.
Carolina Pettersson: like i i have i have troubles picking one but of course the thing with devon is that what he is doing for the sport is yeah like so powerful in in some way so yeah so both as a puller and as as an ambassador yeah he's a great ambassador i don't i it's
Carolina Pettersson: it's a bit weird because I was off from arm wrestling for a very long time. It was like several years and then, yeah. And then when I came back, I wanted to do a comeback. Like I started two years ago with that one, one and a half or something. And, and it feels like when I came back to arm wrestling, arm wrestling has changed. Uh, it has become more like a public sport and the sport that has fans and all of that. And I think that is,
Carolina Pettersson: partly due to like these kind of events and i think that devon has a big part of it as well so it's like a whole new world and it was when i when i left yeah so yeah yeah it is just like i mean for me is just this is the sport that i enjoy and
Engin Terzi: You all are our superstars. People, of course, they think Ronaldo, Messi superstars. Yes, they are superstars. But I love arm wrestling much more than I love football. So my superstars are the ones who are arm wrestling, especially at the world stage. I have respect for from bottom to top everyone.
Engin Terzi: respect is what i say anyway so the reason i ask is that if you guys if you ladies follow uh male arm wrestling because except your match the rest of the matches are male matches and do you have if i ask you right now from your own memory can you tell me any match do you remember come on yes yeah yeah okay elizabeth you say first which match do you know just say one
Engin Terzi: uh ios match what i love it it went on our card so you're talking about i think i think you're getting cut or either my connection or your connection okay are you talking about talking about the card right yeah yeah yeah you say ayala is pulling against you
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah and and then yeah jerry no no i said only one let's go with the latin who's winning there mike winning because he's american or mike winning because he's stronger or you think like that answer that come on man i was saying i couldn't answer that but i'm just i'm just kidding i i i hope that mike wins because it's a good comeback you know
Carolina Pettersson: Okay. And you, Carolina? About that much. Yeah. Do you know the Atlas? Yeah. But I haven't followed them. So I don't know a lot. I know who they are, who they look like, but I haven't seen them pulling a lot. But I think that Lachlan. Okay. Somebody wrote that Caro is checking her phone to see the matchup.
Engin Terzi: is that true oh carolina is cheating you know i don't need i don't need it okay okay i promise i i can put my phone somewhere i put it here on the other side why are you lying victor come on and then carolina i will be pulling him next the guy who wrote this okay yeah see victor you're gonna get your ass kicked you'll be careful what you're writing
Carolina Pettersson: And Carolina, what else do you know as a match? I know it's that Toms's will be pulling Justin Bishop. Yeah, and who is winning there? Toms's. Toms's winning? Yeah, yeah. It's the same here. I know, or it's not the same. I have seen Toms's pulling. I haven't seen Justin pulling, but I have understood, or maybe I've seen something. I've understood that he's like,
Carolina Pettersson: He has been pulling some lighter guys, and I think Toms's has been very dominating. He was at the Europeans now. I am the host now. Okay, Engin just left us. Okay, so... So who else do you know, Carolina? Sorry, what did you say?
Engin Terzi: last year uh i okay he's he's coming back okay welcome back sorry sorry sorry that that the new phone i got when somebody is calling um
Engin Terzi: uh i don't know how to handle the situation and okay you are saying that thomas is gonna win and yeah but elizabeth do you know who thomas is probably not right do you know justin i know of him okay okay so let's go another one jerry cadoret versus hermes gasparini who is winning there that's a tough one
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: Okay, first I ask you, Elizabeth, who do you want to be? Jerry. Jerry, because he is your countryman, right? Yeah, but also when I first started, he kind of, he helped me. He taught me actually how to inside pull. I don't know if he even was aware of it, but he came to a practice and it was one of my first times on the table and he was teaching me how to inside pull. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Engin Terzi: another thing before i ask carolina um somebody asked you if you do specific training and you answer what i saw that on the social media you said there is always something specific yeah what was that like can you explain like how much is because usually the videos that you are sharing is just like i don't know how to express but like general
Engin Terzi: you know power you know but you have to do specific training but you are not showing us so that carolina wouldn't realize she will just think oh this is just a power lifter you know
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: yeah i mean i i don't have enough time to show my entire workout i'm in the gym for a long time um sometimes two a days um and so i usually just pick a general clip um but that being said there's always certain things that i'm working on that might be new that i'm trying out to see how it applies to the table and i don't necessarily want
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: everyone's seen it just yet it's not not just to Carolina it could be a whole there's a whole lot of girls that I'd rather than not see things um
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: and but that being said the general things in the gym it can be applied to the table i don't think you mentioned earlier like fall in how he's growing strength and he's applying it to the table but just because he's doing like so many pronators and stuff he's he's applying his general strength that he gets in the gym to the table do you do you um are you like team us
Engin Terzi: are you guys in touch like paul ever reaches you checks how you are doing any any like or everyone is on their own i i know but paul is usually like uh paul is coming with you guys you know here as a team captain or trainer yeah excited for that that's awesome yeah yeah so
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: Go ahead. Sorry, to address your question, I think that there's more, more of them are now reaching out and trying to help and
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: network. I think sometimes, I think in Sweden, you guys, correct me if I'm wrong, Carolina, you guys seem a lot more connected. Even when Fia came to visit, you all seem to have a history and a bond and friendship, and you're always connecting with each other and cheering each other on. I think that the United States were lagging on that a little bit, but there's these groups of us, right? There'll be a group here and a group there and a group there.
Carolina Pettersson: um but sweden just kind of seems more connected overall especially with the females yeah yeah you're right um and the same question to you ermes jerry i don't know but i think that like um um jerry has like a quite special pulling style so it's uh it's very interesting to like look at his matches and i don't see that
Carolina Pettersson: Ermes would like pin him I think it I think that this will be a like a good matchup I think that it will be it will be a war huh yeah I think so so you don't you don't see neither of them dominating each other no I've heard that from others that like Ermes will dominate Ermes will win but I I don't know I just I have a feeling that it will be more of a war but I don't know
Engin Terzi: I don't know. I don't know. We will see. Anything can happen. Thank you for your super chat. Can they give little tips about how they will try to beat each other? Like what is their first plan and how confident they are? Great matchup. Again, this is the question if you would like to answer.
Carolina Pettersson: why why would anyone share the strategy right just for the sake of a super chat but it's up to you ladies you know um i don't want to like say say everything that i'm thinking um about how i will go about it but i think that i will um i will use the like
Carolina Pettersson: advantages that i have um for winning uh i don't know if you uh elizabeth want to like elaborate about your tactics then maybe i can elaborate there about mine see like for example elizabeth uh carolina i have seen you pulling
Engin Terzi: many times i just can't imagine you doing something different than what i have been seeing because like why would you do something totally different when i know that you have done the same thing a thousand times with little adjustments you know i think you're gonna do what what you do best you know i mean yeah that's correct i i won't i will do what i always
Engin Terzi: Yeah, because your muscle memory is just totally full with it. It needs a long time for radical changes. But while Elizabeth, I don't know, because she's still on the process. So I don't know. But I saw her also, I kind of realized her pulling style. Not sure if she is going to change anything, but it's totally up to her.
Engin Terzi: Okay, they are saying the Sancai say bring your husbands to Istanbul to do what you did us for them. And another thing. While we will that yeah you're right Elizabeth does not sure about Carolina I don't know what what does chance mean by this okay and Elizabeth are you going to tell us how you're going to beat.
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: I mean, with confidence. No, I'm just kidding. No, I'm not going to share. I think that she's maybe relying on me using my press more than I really. I think that I'm definitely more advanced on the table than she's giving me credit for. Okay. So you're going to show us something.
Engin Terzi: that she doesn't know yeah it's not gonna be perfect i'm not i've only been in the sport you know two years but i i don't i think that she might be selling me short a little bit yeah it's good for you it's good for you it's always good to be underestimated but i talk with uh who came to us fear and money i think they they train with you ladies right
Engin Terzi: Yeah, they talk highly about you. They just say that, yeah, she's very strong and she's open to learning and she progressed quick. This is what they told me as far as I remember. Yeah, see, there is another reason, Elizabeth, to kick her ass. She doesn't give you the credit you deserve. And then after the goal, you hold her and you said, you remember what you were saying about my abilities?
Engin Terzi: egan you're really trying to stir the pot yes yes yes yes but it's good that you you ladies understand a lot of people when i do the same thing we usually there is no underdog in this uh match but if there is there is an underdog like if devon looks favorite if i talk by the side of dave they are like oh you see that he hates devon you know
Engin Terzi: like if another match is happening like i always a little bit support the underdog you know and then and then people just don't understand that i'm trying to steal the pot but they they just easily you hate that guy and that's why you do that you know yeah yeah anyway so another match morozov versus gennady elizabeth do you know do you know these guys
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: yeah so i started following marazzo and i really like him as a puller um so i really i he's he's one of my new favorites so i would say that i hope that he wins for sure you hope that he wins but do you have any any reason reason that you know like you think he would win or it's because he is your favorite puller no i really like this his strength on the table i understand
Engin Terzi: And Carolina, you have pulled so many events where Gennady was present throughout your European career. And Morozov and you, not sure if you ever pulled in the same event. I don't think you ever pulled. No, no, no. For me, he is new. Don't misunderstand. But the thing is, as you said, Gennady has
Carolina Pettersson: I think like the first events that I participated internationally, he was like a top puller in his weight class. And he has been since then. So it's like amazing experience and amazing achievements. And so I guess that what he has on his side is experience among a lot of other things.
Carolina Pettersson: But Morozov of course looks like very dominant. The little that I have seen of him, he's just like dominating. So it would be, I cannot really imagine him losing Morozov, but I do not think that Gennady will like go down without a fight. So I think that it will be,
Carolina Pettersson: quite even i think there will be like a three to two match or something so either side i think maybe but uh yeah i think more so but i'm rooting for gennady because i i've seen him so your your your mind is saying morozov your heart is saying generally that's what i said you could say that yeah yeah this is what i understand yeah
Engin Terzi: Anyways, is there another match that you ladies want to mention? If not, then we can just get your last words to each other. It is less than three weeks. You will be here and it will be great. And I hope you ladies will have injury-free preparation in the last, I don't know, how long are you planning to rest?
Engin Terzi: uh i think three days three days before the departure before the event um not sure okay because that means either either five days or uh three days this is why i say yeah yeah okay um but i just asked
Carolina Pettersson: uh my coach about it and he said three days because i i don't uh do you do you do train tough till three days or just get a little bit lighter she doesn't want to share the secrets with you elizabeth that's why she doesn't say it's not that it's it's just that my my mind isn't that far my planning is like for for this day
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: okay that's the difference between me and carolina is uh i plan is everything's planned out i'm i'm focused in their focus i know the drill i know i think i messaged you again like when i need to weigh in when i need to cut when i need to refeed i'm all focused on this match so and who's your trainer
Elizabeth Rae Mocek: I mean, I pull with the team with Relentless and Erie, Pennsylvania, but I don't have like a trainer. Oh, okay. Okay. I understand. I'm saying I'm all focused, which is, you know. Yeah, I understand. I understand. Let's see. Let's see. They're asking you if you ladies have YouTube channel. No, not me.
Engin Terzi: not yet they have they have instagram and they have facebook for sure i know um and then let's see let's see maybe maybe they will go further and then have youtube channel with time yeah anyway so you ladies do you have any last message for each other best of luck
Carolina Pettersson: yeah i agree um it will be nice to meet you and um very nice to to prove you and and sorry about the result this one you're gonna say that yeah can you imagine last minute last minute and i'm still trying trying to steer the boat you know there will be more i i think that we will both be very much on fire
Engin Terzi: yeah she said the same thing she said the same thing without the strip it will be a war but when she said that once in step she will tell you and say sorry carolina you know i didn't mean to but i have to i i have bigger goals you know yeah we'll see we will see yeah see she never said anything and look at what i am doing like like like i said you know
Engin Terzi: anyway so thank you very much ladies and then hope to see you in two and a half weeks again you know stay injury free and you will be honored to host you ladies and i think that we will have fun big fun you know yeah for sure yeah you you you take care and thank you for your time thank you for coming and being my guests thank you so much
