Engin Terzi: to be close to you hello hello guys denise hello dennis then it's great to see you yeah
Engin Terzi: So how is everything? Yes, everything is good. Good. Yeah, I just did my last training. I wasn't going to do one more, but I did one last table training. And yeah. So how are you guys? You guys will train? Yes, everything is fine, my friend. You guys will train today? Yes, we have two training. We have to just check...
Babken: Arjun, to understand, Denis, now it's start training, but not too much. After maybe one month, he will be more serious. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because only is depending from doctor's moments, health, check everything one more time before
Engin Terzi: hard training and before hard moments and we will start but dennis looked bigger than last time i saw him show biceps yeah yeah his arm everything yeah looks bigger bigger than last time yeah very good yeah
Engin Terzi: So, Artem, you ready for Corey? Yes, I'm ready. You ready? Yes. No trauma? Nothing? No. Good shape? Yes. Three brothers. Yeah, yeah, three brothers, yeah. And, yeah. So, Artem, if...
Engin Terzi: If you win against Corey, do you have any plan with left arm for the future or no? We'll see. We'll see. Yeah, I understand. And how do you see your chance, winning chance? Against Corey? Corey, yeah, yeah. Yeah, sorry. I'm nailing it.
Engin Terzi: He would like to say 100%, but for respectable, maybe 90%. Looks like somebody is in good shape and very confident. That's good.
Babken: And Artem, how do you see Dave versus Devon? Devon... Devon win. Devon win? Yes, he is angry too, because we know these moments, he say...
Babken: We want, of course, he will win. Day one, he has to win. But Sheffield, it's maybe better to win.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so to everyone who is watching this live, and you guys, I just trained and hardly came, so I have a little bit meat here. At the same time, I will eat, so I apologize because I trained. If I don't eat protein for one and a half hours, it will be unprofessional, so I ask for forgiveness. Yeah, we just ate it.
Babken: We will eat together, but we are full. And when are you guys going to train? Bon appetit. When will you train, tonight? After our live broadcast.
Babken: We will check, we will understand. Artem, you know, this period is better to do something about left hand. Because he needs two weeks before that. And right hand, we will understand how it's possible, how it grows. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The question...
Artyom Morozov: He told us that he's very confident about Kory. What does he think about his match with Gennady? What do you think about him? How confident is he about Kory, and why is he so confident about Gennady? Well, it's not going to be easy for Gennady either, but he's confident. If I wasn't confident, why would I fight?
Babken: Yes, he is confident too about Jena. Of course, it will be more hard than Corey. But of course, if he is not confident for what, he is fighting. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand. But it is going to be a tough match. Yeah, both of them are very, very strong. Of course.
Babken: And what is his weight now? When he came to Istanbul, he was a little bit smaller. Yes, it's a little... Because at that time, he had sick moments. Yeah, yeah. But now he's 130. Maybe more. We'll check it. 130? Yeah, 30, maybe more. I understand. Let's see how it will be.
Engin Terzi: and and dennis um how is your preparation how is your preparation and we all heard that you are upset with devon uh yesterday i had a phone call with devon they wanted me to tell that i don't know what he exactly meant but he waited for like six years to pull with you right arm and he said you can wait a few months i don't know what it means but
Babken: What do you have to say about all this? I told you that there was a conference with Devon, and he said that he still needs a couple of months after this. And Engin offered to do it in November. Well, somewhere in the middle. No problem.
Denis Cyplenkov: Does his position suit you? No, his position doesn't suit me, because there are agreements. We are used to fulfilling our agreements. And he did not do so well in relation to us. That's all.
Babken: Yes, I will translate and after I will tell about my decisions and my vision. Denis told, of course, I explained him about November, if it will be in November, he said no problem. Early November, yeah. Yeah, early November it will be, it's okay, no problem. Of course, he's upset, he doesn't understand, usually
Babken: normal real men have to be keep work when we fix it and we have you know decisions have to be once you know one time once agreed once agreed not many time making agreements
Babken: Yeah, small changes are okay. Small, you know. Yes, yes. Of course, we are adequate persons and if really we saw something, you know, normal, as we change, it's normal. But if, you know, and Devon, what he told me last time when he talked with you, he said,
Babken: But he knew, of course, about our decisions. And before, when he changed it, I remember he talked with me. And you know about what I told you. And he didn't tell me nothing about his, you know, changing or his new matches against Genoa. And that's why if he told you last time in life,
Babken: Babken call me, I will explain you like this, blah, blah, blah. I'm not, I'm, if he change something and he have to call me, first of all, because I don't change nothing. What we have agreement between you, me, Denis and Devon, we fix it long time before. And we don't change. It's not good. If Denis have any matches,
Babken: before that and he have injury or something like this and we cancel this match. This is respectable relations. Of course, Denis fights half years, we fix it. Each half year, we have to do some matches for Denis. Then Devon, of course, he do
Babken: each month, two months, per time, one time or something like this, okay. But if we have something fixed before that, we have to be more respectable for each other. And that's why even, you know,
Babken: our talking you saw if continue like this and Denis will not want to make any deal with Devon we fix it and we have to keep our word and that's why if he want I am serious if he want to lose or have matches and lose or expectable he have to fight with Denis because
Babken: For our team, like Artyom Morozov or Zaur and even Tadikian, they will destroy you. That's why if you want to lose, respectable, Denis is ready because he is the same near age. The young guys, they don't understand. They will crash. They won't listen to me. And that's why you have to call to me.
Babken: If you want to change something, please, I'm all the time on the phone. I'm ready to talk. Or, you know, we will see in Dubai and we will talk. No problem. But we have to keep his word. Yeah, I will share my opinion. I think that Devon's plan was to pull Gennady. You know...
Engin Terzi: Devon last time pulled at the East vs. West stage in November. So it is normal that Devon is going to pull someone before Dennis until the next October.
Engin Terzi: 11 months just like from brooklyn match of course this a little bit later he also has sundry smash but still almost like 10 11 months it's too long time i understand dennis needs six months but not every athlete can wait that long you know since people yes of course yeah because i would just say just one second so devon devon's plan i think was to pull only gannadi
Engin Terzi: Justin pull Gennady and beat Gennady. And then Dennis, my opinion. So when he lost, my opinion, I think he wanted to face Dennis as a winner instead of someone who lost to Gennady. So that is, I think he wants to take care of that. And then my opinion, I think out of respect to Dennis, that he wants to come, hey, listen, Dennis, I'm here.
Engin Terzi: I'm a winner. I beat Gennady. Because the plan, he didn't plan to lose against Gennady. You understand what I'm saying? It was not because he wanted the disrespect. But, again, I also believe that he should pull Dennis as he gave his word. But, you know, soon we will go to Dubai. You will be there. I will be there. And then Devon will be there. I think we can sit down and
Engin Terzi: I think he can express himself. But I am forced to know that he doesn't mean disrespect to Dennis. It's not because he's here right now, but Dennis, I mean, one of those guys that I have the most respect. You know, Dennis deserves respect. Thank you, thank you. This level, you know, yeah. So I think we can fix this problem without...
Engin Terzi: being upset with each other. Or we can be upset with each other and they can pull that way. It will probably stir the pot even more. There will be more personal mess. As long as it doesn't get ugly, I don't mind. Yes, my friend. And his ambition, it's not good when we mix our plans together. Because his ambition is his ambition.
Babken: It's, uh, and that's why, uh, we have to respect, uh, okay. It's like, you think it's, or everything it's okay like this, but how Dennis do and Dennis do not only for comfortable, only just, uh, and he couldn't, uh, change each month is important about, uh, this period because, you know, uh, his story about health moments and that's why he have maybe many things, preparation.
Babken: uh in hospital to check everything is fixed and after that and before three months before three months you have to start without risk that's why we have to everybody want to see a long time dennis and that's why everything everybody have to understand the situation what we have and even uh his opponents devon
Babken: or the other opponent, or somebody else who wants to beat with Devon, like Ermes or the other guys. Of course, we are ready, but we have to understand many moments and respect his new choice.
Engin Terzi: Again, I don't think he means disrespect. I think he's going to pull. But he also told me some other things. He's going to also talk with you in Dubai, as far as I understand. And then again, we can sit down and we can fix this problem. But I'm 100% sure he's going to pull Denis. But I understand that you are saying that he needs to pull Denis on the time that has agreed. Yes, for half a month.
Engin Terzi: plus or minus like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe like, maybe not like October, but early November, like just like two weeks or something. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. I hope, I hope everything will work good because both Devon and Denis are icons of the sport and we will see. So Denis, how is, how is, how is your shape, my friend? How is your shape? How do you feel?
Denis Cyplenkov: How do you feel? In general, everything is fine, I am ready to start full-fledged training. But so far, let's say, there are enough terms not to force the event. Moreover, if you are still postponing November, then I still have a month in stock.
Babken: In general, I'm ready for the work defense. Tell me when and where. He's ready for defending, defenders and for attack, how I can translate. And you're feeling good. Yes, if you change in November, if we fix it about this, yes, you have one month else of free time.
Babken: I think in a few weeks we will find out. But compared to his prime, where is he now? Is he in better shape than John Match?
Babken: I will start with a more serious form than before, so I will approach my peak as I planned. At that time he started from zero, and that's why now his situation, he accumulates more good conditions, and from here, from this start, it will be easier to go up.
Denis Cyplenkov: So he is in better shape than John Match. But do you feel better now than during the match? Right now? Yes. No, how can I feel better if I was resting? I'm just talking about the beginning of the training process. I may not be at the peak right now, but roughly speaking, if you take it from John's fight, maybe 20% less.
Babken: He told 20% less now. Than the John match? Yes. Because he just started training? Yes, because I don't train. Only just training one time per week. Make practice like this. And another question. If this Devon match happens in October and November, is he planning to be how much better than John match?
Denis Cyplenkov: 10% better? When you come during the match against Devon, what do you think your form will be and what do you plan to do? Well, let's put it this way. I roughly understand what I raised when I fought with John. And when I go to the peak to fight with Devon, I'll tell you everything. I'm not an extra-sense to guess which one I'll fight.
Babken: He couldn't ask correctly now because he has huge plans. How much he wants to, of course. Near the matches, he can correctly ask. Okay. He can correctly answer. Okay, yeah. Yes. Yeah, there is a super hit. Three more.
Babken: Will Babkin compete at East vs West Sunday? He is looking strong. With great pleasure. But now, first of all, I have to recuperate my injuries moment. Because when I started, I started a long time before, approximately in 2015-2017.
Babken: uh it's um 37 age i start very late yes and start with uh you know crazy animals like uh denis like training we start and you know about this i i have good character and i don't like give up
Babken: And that's why each day we beat together and I broke all my hands. And that's why until now I couldn't get trained normally. But now I try to understand. It's better to keep in training. If you find somebody, I'm like a hunter. If I find something, I feel confident, I have to beat with him.
Babken: Even I have to lose, but I have to check. That's why you have to control. All arm wrestlers and Engin tell the same. In training, you have to be smart. Not like me before. Because if you want to slowly, and arm wrestling slowly grew up.
Babken: not fast, it's impossible. Everything has to be step by step. If you want to just now and today, armwrestling is not your sport. Can you ask Denis, after he got Devon upset a little bit, angry, did it become a little personal for him?
Engin Terzi: Do you feel something personal? Yeah, after all this, you know, like because he felt like he had to mention this on YouTube, you know, and then he said that he's like upset. And then he came to a point to question Devon's, you know, like, you know, a man should keep his word and this and that. So did it become a little personal?
Denis Cyplenkov: Yes, you know, Denis is
Babken: i told his general manager in the mall and with his you know who rent from him the landis he give you know uh one second i will translate fine fine you know fine oh yeah yeah yeah you fine and that's why from devon we need uh to
Babken: fine. So he's going to find him. He's going to punish him. He has a duty. A duty moment here. We will see how he... So it's a little bit more than arm wrestling now. Yes, of course. A little bit of personality. Half of his honorars have to give back. Yeah, but Devon is known to be
Engin Terzi: probably the biggest trash talker ever in arm wrestling. He is like McGregor of arm wrestling. Is Dennis not afraid to come to such points with Devin? Because Devin now talks very, very respectfully when he talks about Dennis. But if it goes to that side, then Devin,
Babken: is gonna give some headaches to Dennis. Is he not afraid? Does he have thick skin? His skin is thick enough to handle Devon's, you know, trash-talking? He says, well, we know that Devon is like in UFC, like McGregor, trash-talker, and he is not afraid of Dennis to cross this line, and he will, like, well, fight from his side, and from his...
Babken: Yes, he don't afraid. It's trolling, just friendship trolling. He don't care.
Babken: But in my opinion, I think they won't go the other side because we have story relations. We are not yesterday, of course, know each other. And, you know, I can be a little angry. I think respectable relations we have to keep.
Engin Terzi: So you are saying that he would be angry if he talked trash? Of course. I will not forgive. Yeah, but do you think he cares? I don't think he cares. We will see. Yeah. Anyway, so you are saying that he wouldn't go there. You are basically saying that...
Engin Terzi: He knows better not to go there. Yes, and he knows one more thing. He didn't get away from us. What do you mean? He couldn't get away from us. We will find each other. It started to sound like a threat.
Engin Terzi: BigGloveGoals is asking, Engin, can you ask them what John Bersink means to them? Like, let's start with you, Babkin, very shortly. What does John Bersink mean to you? I didn't hear... Like, what is... When you hear John Bersink, what comes to your mind? Me? Yeah.
Babken: Whole arm wrestling, really. Yeah. Yes. Because for me, and like, you know, I don't, if I like somebody or if I saw somebody in some area or some community, of course, he's number one in this community, like face, you know.
Babken: like personality like you know for me john is great person a great athlete i'm very appreciate to know this kind of person really yeah and what does morozov think
Babken: John, I really like him. I like him as a personality, as a sportsman, as a person. I would like to follow his path, at least a little bit. How about you? Yes, he respects too much, and like a sportsman, like a person, and he wants the same, like him, a little short period,
Denis Cyplenkov: Go like him. How is your sporting experience like this? Yeah, and how about Denis? What about Denis? What do you think about John? Are you kidding me? I've said it a hundred times already. He's my idol. I looked at him and tried to hold his hand. I think he's great. It's like...
Babken: Yes, for him he's like... Koumir, he's like king of how you draw in T-shirt. He's like this, really. He's a huge person.
Engin Terzi: and all of the best. Yeah, I think he said something, but okay. Anyway, so good to hear. And Tim Altair, thank you for your super chat. Hello, Engin. Is Deniz 100% now? But we asked him, he said he's not even at the level that he was against. John, but you can ask him because it's a super chat. Can you ask him? But they are asking if he is 100%.
Denis Cyplenkov: He also asks what you are in shape now, in terms of percentage. Well, actually, let's put it this way. If you compare it with John, when I was fighting, plus 20% added 100%. He thought... He will come for Devon in 20% of...
Engin Terzi: He will come for Devon more than how he was. This is his plan. Yeah, that's good. That's good. Yeah, that's good. And ask him, is it going to be enough to beat Devon? I think it's enough, of course. As I said, I'm going step by step. I need Devon. I need the next fight with him.
Babken: Yes, and he goes step by step. And next match, of course, he saw only Devon. I understand. I need his endurance. He needs his endurance. Denis needs endurance? Denis needs Devon's endurance. Oh, okay. We need to make amends for that.
Engin Terzi: You have to check his endurance. Yeah, Devon has great endurance. Devon seemed like he didn't have endurance, but he was pulling against Gennady inside. Against Dennis, they both will go out like this, and Dennis' endurance is very good. I think that...
Engin Terzi: But Denis needs to make very good preparation because Denis is just coming back. While Devon is already in his very good shape. I'm sure that Denis knows what to do. He has experience. You mean with Devon? Yeah, of course.
Engin Terzi: little bit different different style now he's more like yes but uh you why you think he will beat like this you mean white dynasty is gonna do like this he will have he will have many options yeah yeah yeah this is as far as what we see from trainings matches that this is more like open up top rope like but we will see yeah it will be great it will be great i think that that is
Engin Terzi: um i think most likely devon and dennis are the most popular arm wrestlers on this earth yeah and it will be an incredible match incredible match but i would suggest you not to be angry just because devon talks trash because that that is that is part of the game you know um trust me it is how it is gonna take attention how it is gonna
Babken: Because not many people are looking deep into the pure arm wrestling. They want a little bit of story as well. But the story... Yeah, of course. But everybody has limits. Limits, yeah, okay. Jokes limit have to be. If coming out, you know, everybody free person. Yeah. If you... Everybody free and nobody don't want to hurt each other. Yeah, yeah. If you, you know, border...
Babken: I'm sure Devon knows the border. That's why this is normal if we joke, how we do today. But Devon is not Burn's birthday yesterday. He's a smart guy. Yeah, he knows it. I'm sure that he doesn't have to be joking. Maybe he will be serious. But he still will know the limit. Of course. Yeah.
Babken: We understand like this. Because we look at each other's face after the match. Match is going to be passed, but we will still continue to be friends. Of course. We are one family. Inside the family, we have many moments. Of course, we have to decide. You know many moments now we have, but we are all friends.
Engin Terzi: Tell Denis that when he starts to hold Devon, it is okay for Devon to talk to him during the match. Ask Devon how is his day. Tell him don't be shy to him. Devon has to bring his translator if you want to ask something.
Babken: Because he will not understand or Denis will understand not correct. It will be bad for him. Yeah, but at the arm-wrestling table, yeah. Let's see. I think the best answer at the arm-wrestling table is winning. Yes, and I think Devon will feel very not comfortable with Devon. He will have on time.
Babken: for, you know, trash talking or something. So you think that he will be like this and then... No, of course not. No, no, of course it will be real... Oh, okay. So you are saying that it will be so hard, so hard that he won't have time to talk. He will be busy. He will think the other things, not about joking. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand. Yeah.
Denis Cyplenkov: Let's see how it will be. And Denis, what do you think about Jerry vs. Ermes match? What do you think about Jerry vs. Ermes? What will be the choice? It's a very difficult question. I understand that Ermes, LeBron, all of them are very strong guys. But Cagarete can be very uncomfortable for them. I don't know.
Denis Cyplenkov: I don't know what he's fighting for, but I understand that he feels very comfortable in his corner. And many people get into him and don't know what to do. So I would like Ermes to find a key. Ermes and Levan, this person, of course, is a very huge and very strong sportsman.
Babken: Jerry is not comfortable. He can be not comfortable for many sportsmen. And that's why Ermes has to find a key for him. If he will find, of course, he can beat him. I think lately I look at Jerry. Jerry is getting bigger, stronger, and then he's coming very serious. Ermes must not make a mistake.
Engin Terzi: Many people are underestimating Jerry. Maybe Ermes is going to win. But Jerry is not the type of guy that you can underestimate. If you underestimate him, then you will feel like a building is collapsing on your arm. Yeah, of course. We will see. Ermes will have to be very serious. Yeah. He says that he has no chance.
Babken: We'll see. But, of course, I support Ermes. Ermes is our friend. Of course, we want Ermes to win, but it will not be an easy game. Can you ask Denis what he thinks about Gennady vs. Artem? What do you think about Gennady vs. Artem? As I said, it will be an interesting fight. I want to watch it.
Babken: I don't know. Yena is a very versatile athlete. They can fight in different ways. It will be a challenge for Artem. It will be a challenge for Artem. It will be very interesting matches. Because Yena has many options to fight. It will be not easy.
Engin Terzi: Can you ask Dennis, does he also agree that Gennady that he saw 10 years ago when he was competing in the same category with Dennis and other guys and Gennady of today are different Gennady. At that time, it was Gennady who was competing with Guelph, Europeans, but now Gennady is a different Gennady. Does he realize that he's a different guy?
Babken: Yes, what do you think about Gena, who performed 10 years ago, when he performed at other competitions, at Pauli, or how is he now? Well, I would like to remind you that there was a grid there, and Gena is resilient.
Denis Cyplenkov: It was clear that he was fighting with Lara, even now. He is tough, but when it comes to the net, he couldn't show himself in such a format as he is now. And R-Fighting is probably his format, where he can really do his best.
Babken: Before, he hadn't experience with the arm fight. It will be net, like the other system of fights.
Babken: Now I think it's especially for him, this kind of arm fights. So you think that's the difference, huh? Yes. You think the only difference is the arm fights. Okay. I don't know, but it depends on him.
Engin Terzi: so and he couldn't uh explain because only he can understand his shape is more good or more good or super hit dennis big grow goals thank you my friend dennis i'm a big fan you are a humble athlete much like john i love his youtube channel he needs to say devon yeah big boy as he crushes him he he's saying that you know
Babken: He respects him so much. And he said that when he beats Devon, he needs to say, yeah, big boy. He writes that he's a fan of yours. And when you beat Devon, you tell him, like,
Engin Terzi: he said john johnson thank you for your super chat he said jerry told a story about he and dennis arm wrestle in a bar long time ago the table was broken does dennis remember that story can he add anything to this story uh with whom i don't understand jerry jerry cadoret
Babken: And Denis, a long time ago, in a bar, the armrest and the table was broken. Do you remember that? Yes. Do you remember? You fought with Jerry. It was a long time ago. At the bar, on the table, and the table broke. Who fought? You fought with Jerry. Where did you fight? Somewhere a long time ago, in a bar. In a bar? I don't know. We didn't cross paths anywhere.
Engin Terzi: With Jerry, you have an experience. In Nemirov, he came, but he lost. No, no, no. In a bar. Yes, he doesn't remember. He doesn't remember. Okay. So he was a superstar. I had to ask him. Anyways. And can you ask Artyom, what does he think about Gennady versus Devon rematch?
Artyom Morozov: I think Gena will win it too, even easier. Do you think Gena will beat him more easily? Oh, this time he will beat him easily? Yes, more easily. If Devin acted like a man and fought with Denis and didn't ask for a rematch, and then fought with Gena after Denis, I would be happy if he was happy and won.
Babken: He told if he, yes, it's team ethic, you know. He told if after Chaffee he will beat, go to the beat, Denis he will understand and he will, I will wish him win. But now he will lose because karma is working.
Babken: If Gennady beats Devon, is Denis going to pull Devon?
Babken: Of course, yes. Because we fixed it. How can I go back? Artem explained, it will be the same matches like 2018 when it's mirror matches. 6-0.
Engin Terzi: Babken, do you guys want to bet with me $10,000 that there will not be the score? I mean, Morozov said this, right? Morozov said this. 6-0 or you said 6-0? I don't tell, but I'm sure if you want, we can do this. $10,000? Yes. You said 6-0?
Babken: No, of course. About 6-0, I don't tell. No, no, no. Okay, 6-0. Who said 6-0? Artem said 6-0? Yes, but Artem, he said mirror. About 6-0, he didn't tell. Okay, but you just said 6-0. Yes, mirror like 2018. Okay, but can you ask him if it's going to be 6-0? 6-0. Are you sure? How many rounds will there be?
Engin Terzi: he told his wishes no no because i'm joking because i joke because at the east versus west it is only three rounds yeah okay what do you say
Engin Terzi: You catch us like this, Denis. Yeah, you need to be careful when you are talking with me. 5-0 or 3-0. You need to be careful when you are talking with me. I'm joking, you know, yeah. There is a super chat. Silky Wilky, thank you. Is Morozov ready for Corey West? The Terminator has never faced King Kong. Artem will be trying to pronate an engine block.
Engin Terzi: Artyom is afraid of Corey's hands. Okay. Is Artyom afraid of Corey West? And he said he's Terminator, but he never faced King Kong. He's Terminator, but he's never seen King Kong. Terminator. You've seen Terminator, but never seen King Kong. I've seen it on TV. I've seen it.
Babken: He watched TV. What? He watched TV and he saw King Kong. Oh, okay. On movie. Yeah, but when he said that he never armless of King Kong. Yeah. Yeah. And he's asking if he's afraid? Afraid of Corey? Afraid? We're not going to fight. And if we fight, it's not scary.
Babken: Yes. Yes, Terminator. Of course, no. Even we will not fight together. But if we will fight, it will be more easy. You mean like fight this? No, fight this. Real fight. Oh, real fight. Yes. If real fight, no problem. It will be more easy. Oh, today you guys are very... He's Terminator. He remind me. Yeah, but remember King Kong.
Babken: I'm afraid of only Magnet. He's afraid only of Magnet, you know, man. Oh, he's afraid of X-Men. You mean Devon? No, no, Magnet. Devon is the other hero. That's it.
Engin Terzi: The one is Wolverine. Yeah. Yes. There is another super chat. Trip War. Thank you for your super chat. Okay. They are asking if Deniz ever pulled Voivoda in prime times, in their best time. If they ever arm wrestle, real arm wrestling competition. I will tell you no. Because that period they haven't communicated.
Engin Terzi: Because when Denis was prime, Alexey was away from arm wrestling. Yeah, I understand. Yeah, that's interesting. Another question for Denis. Denis, I said Rewaz versus Vitaly Laletin, East versus West 9 in August. How do you see that match?
Denis Cyplenkov: What do you think about this match? August. It will be interesting, but I think... It will be interesting, but if you compare it with the Czech Republic... I don't even know what to say.
Denis Cyplenkov: It will be not easy for Vitalik. Is it because of the pulling style that Valentin is more like this and then Revan is more up?
Babken: Do you think it will be very hard with Chaffee?
Babken: will be not easy. How do you see that match, Babken? Everything is depending on
Babken: many you know nuances how it's possible it's important this side of course and depending from shape of vitality because vitality usually is coming up and coming down we don't understand really he's not stable you know he's of course how i know how he explained me about his injury moments
Babken: and after now he's going up if he will bring good shape of course he have good start than I think Revas but Revas last period he will show us really very huge match and very he will he win very confident and that's why maybe he finds some you know especially tablets or
Babken: Georgi food, as everybody knows, is very tasty. But it's depending on the shape. It's like styles. I think Rewaz has a little more options. Because he has inside pressure, he's more good. If he loses inside pressure, Rewaz...
Babken: it will be very dangerous for Vitaly. Because he styled Vitaly only like this. Physically, he couldn't grow up the other. He haven't the other options. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. And I don't know.
Engin Terzi: As far as I see, the super heavyweights arm wrestling, I think is like golden years. When you look at now, you have Levan, you have Genadi, you have Morozov, you have Denis, you have Laletin, you have Gaur Paisulev, and Ermes, and Devon. They should be very incredible. Our friend, Andrei.
Engin Terzi: Hello, hello, Andrei. Is the arm master still? Yes, he tried to, but he's, you know, a power lifter. A power lifter, yeah. Yes, and a fighter. Yeah, that's good, that's good. From special forces. Yeah. I have a question. How is Zaur's shape? I don't understand this part. Zaur, he had a bicep problem, and I don't understand how he's competing in AMC now. Like, how?
Babken: I stopped all the time, Zaur. I explained to him how we understand his situation is not good. And after this endurance, how we cut biceps, of course, it's a very big risk to come so easy, so short time. That's why I told him, but...
Babken: He talked with his doctors. Doctors say, you are ready for training. And he started training. I don't understand which doctors. I don't know these doctors. Yes, but training, ready being training is different than going to AMC and pulling against guys, you know. It's a different thing, you know. I hope everything will be good without risk. I hope...
Babken: I talked two days before with him. He told me he's feeling good. Approximately his shape will be 90%. If really he likes this and he's feeling confident, maybe he will go there.
Babken: Okay, maybe it's not 100% that he will go AMC? Yes, it's not 100%. He told 90%. Okay, okay. And if he goes to AMC 90%, what do you think is going to happen between him and Laletin? Close? I think for Laletin it will be... His moving, Zaur moving is very dangerous.
Babken: uh he's moving and that's why for letting i think it's not uh how he keep his uh no uh risk of and desire he directly go like you know like bomb moving it will be enough for him to
Engin Terzi: will see i will say by the way guys dennis and levan both will be our special guests and they both will have their trading cards in the next year's first request that they will sign uh top role in sports tomorrow for dennis show them who is the best he is saying that show the world who is the best you know dennis they say yeah anyway so
Engin Terzi: Do you have, before we finish, do you have any message for Devon, the last words? You, Morozov and Denis, you all can say your last words. I love Denis.
Babken: if we change that maximum in november it's if will be more we don't forgive you oh and then you will punish him right last chinese you know
Babken: Warning. Warning, yes. Last chance. Oh, it's the last warning. Okay. Okay. I'm talking with Harakiri. Harakiri, you know what is this? Yeah. Harakiri, for him, it will be a good way. Okay. Okay. Harakiri, if he comes in November, if he comes late, it will be even worse for him. Yeah, before November, it's okay.
Babken: November is only Harakiri. If more, there will be more punishments. All right, Yakuza know what they do. They cut one finger if we do not good thing. If we five times change that, he will have fingers.
Engin Terzi: Oh, every day change, one finger is off. Yes, he has to all the time cut his, you know, one finger, this, the other finger. Okay, so he better accept as soon as possible before he loses all his fingers, yeah. Okay, but even if he accepts for November,
Babken: Because he made Dennis Ingram. Yes, normal. November, okay. But you said that he will still find him, you know, like punish him, right? Until November. Yeah, for Devon, it will be good if he will do October. If it will be November, he will get shape more, 10%.
Babken: Denis will get shape more. So Devon, Devon, Devon, except for October, not even late. Yes, of course. That's why he's digging a grave for himself. And Devon, you know, make his, you know, sleep places. Yeah, yeah. And a message from Morozov to Devon?
Engin Terzi: Okay, guys, Ermes podcast is not in one hour. It is 6 p.m. Italy time, 7 p.m. Turkish time, and 12 p.m. Eastern. So it is two hours later. Anyways, and Baki, you have any message for Devon before we close? I told everything. Everything, okay. Yes, because it's better, you know, for me...

We should be more and more unified. I hope this is going to be the same for the amateur armwrestling as well. And hopefully we will be all together.
Engin Terzi: I don't talk about certain things. It is not because I don't have an opinion, but I just don't want to make the things worse with arguments because there are a lot of people with bad intentions. They are just looking only for negativity to create because of their jealousy. But I just try to focus on what I am doing and to serve arm wrestling. But for sure, without your help, without this Atlas help, without
Babken: I can't do anything, I'm nothing, I'm nothing without being together. That's why we have to be all together and to be kind for each other because many negative our area out of you know all over the world it's very very dangerous and very you know
