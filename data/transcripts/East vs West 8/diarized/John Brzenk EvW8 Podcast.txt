Unknown: Are you there? No, I can't hear you. Let me see. I might have. Oh, why does this always happen to me sometimes? Audio. Are you there? Still not there.
Unknown: But the speaker seems right. That's, yes, yes, yes, I hear the phone. Yeah, no, no, I gotcha. Now I lost you. So how speaker and microphone.
Engin Terzi: speak and pause you hear yes I do oh it's my fault now you hear me oh perfect yeah it is my fault it is totally my fault I I turned the camera on but not the microphone I I realize now oh I need more coffee it's too early yeah yeah yeah yeah so how did you make home huh how did you make home
John Brzenk: I got home around 1130 last night. I ended up having to, I went through Atlanta and, um, yeah, so I made it, but it was, that's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. Yeah. Sorry guys. It was my fault. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I thought that both both. I turned the sound and camera. On, but I just did the camera. I didn't do that. I was training John. I was saying it and then training just finished. Yeah, the guys coming over earlier today around 9 o'clock so they pulled quite a bit getting.
John Brzenk: I don't know. I think I'm in better shape, stronger, but I'm also hurting more. So, you know, I don't know where to draw the line. Say again, say again. You are in better shape, but? Yeah, no, I'm in good shape because I've been pushing it real hard the last few weeks. You know, of course, I took that two months off after Dennis. But yeah, well, better shape comes with more aches and pains. So throughout the night, I go, oh, my goodness, what's going on? I think, I think.
Engin Terzi: when you have like a when you realize that you have formed i think that maybe it is good to put one day extra for resting because you are already like when you are studying slowly you can't really push so much so the healing time is also shorter but when you come to your limits that your tendons and everything is feeling more so if you are in good shape it is always like
John Brzenk: rest until you feel okay because you know that you're in good shape you know yeah well the problem is most of the time for my aches and pains to go away and the tendons really to heal up it takes like a week and a half two weeks well you feel like you're almost you know back out of shape by the time you you get everything tightened up and healed up right so you are saying that when you when you really train so hard now it takes up to one and a half week in the past i remember it was one week for you
John Brzenk: Yeah, no, I mean, I've been trying to do the Devon thing or, you know, just arm us almost every day or at least, you know, train every day along with the arm wrestling. And it's been slowly breaking me down to the point where.
John Brzenk: I mean, maybe it's getting to be beneficial in the long run, but I just feel like, oh, I'm just getting too torn down. So yeah, everybody is a little different, I guess. But I guess you can't always just be at your best. But sometimes I feel like I didn't really train that hard, didn't arm wrestle that hard just because I've got little aches and pains going on. It's like, oh, so, but.
Engin Terzi: Sometimes, you know, even just a week or two weeks isn't enough rest. So I don't know what it was. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It depends on how hard you hit. Yeah. Um, guys are asking for gallery mode, but the gallery mode only with the YouTube, uh, YouTube, uh, uh, imitation is possible with the zoom. When you are two people now, it just gives like one at a time, but maybe a little bit later, I will have some, uh, surprise guests.
Engin Terzi: And guys, we started the GoFundMe for our brother in armwrestling. Zurab Tawber is a very good guy. And he competed every single East versus West event since the paper we started with East versus West 2. Unfortunately, he broke his arm. And we are trying to support him because he will need some medical expenses.
Engin Terzi: And so maybe a few more guys will come and then hopefully we will have some good time. We don't want to take so much time off, John, either. So, John, you have a match with Todd Hutchings. Five short weeks away. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it is going to.
John Brzenk: so probably the the king of the light heavyweight in north america probably right right now i think uh i think unquestionably we're probably the two best in north america at yeah yeah no doubt i think um a few other guys thrown in there in the mix in the
John Brzenk: yeah but usually you guys are you know like winning it's funny though thinking about it we haven't really had an open tournament to expose you know the pecking order in many many years now so it's kind of hard to you can really say yeah I feel like I'm you know
John Brzenk: Up there. So we'll see. Todd will definitely be quite the challenge. I know he's gotten so much stronger since he used to practice. And even back five, six years ago when I was in tip-top shape, when he would come over, I'd always question. He was a big reason why I would question my abilities and think, oh, shit, I just need to retire. I just can't hang with this guy anymore. So I expect, you know, tremendous power from him.
John Brzenk: uh i'm hoping that i can actually you know stop it slow it down and then i don't really know what i'm gonna do if i can do that you know because he's got incredible endurance so uh i gotta figure out figure out elaine figure out something i need to get aggressive possibly and make it make it a quick match but um yeah that's dangerous with with that much power yeah yeah yeah he is dangerous for almost everyone i think it's always like
John Brzenk: if possible, better to have a full cup against him without protecting your own pronator. If you just go totally out missing his arm, then he will have his pronator and he will be hitting you, you know, better than anyone else. Yeah. The tough thing to mentally get over will be to be aggressive, to try to hit him to the pad. I mean, if I'm hesitant at all and just trying to protect and maintain a position and kind of purge and get a, get a, you know, a,
John Brzenk: an offensive position, it's probably going to be it might be safer, but I feel like that's going to possibly lead to a loss. I mean, I don't see myself winning the long game with him, but we'll see. I need to I need to just get mentally right and feel that I came out of position. It is so great to see you, you know, competing and and we have
John Brzenk: We also would like to see you against, you know, Ungarbev. Oh, yeah. I would love to be in line for that, but I feel like Todd has the...
Engin Terzi: um he's gonna he deserves the opportunity or chance to pull him if he ends up beating me in canada uh pat hutchings is gonna pull sasho for 95 kilo east versus west world title so 95 kilo touching versus sasho in the same event you versus ongar and there there hopefully be some other great matches and we will see yeah
John Brzenk: Yeah, and I've noticed that Todd has looked a little thinner in this last couple of, I mean, he looks in great shape, but he definitely looks a little thinner. So maybe he's preparing to be that 95 kilo. I just assumed that he would go after, he's been pulling the 105 guys for a while now, so. Yeah, he's like, even many of those 105 matches, he was 100 kilo. Yeah, yeah, the guy is really pushing his limits to be that heavy, you know.
Engin Terzi: and i think he can easily make make a 95 kilo and it will be great you know to see to north american against the two other best like sasho is also incredible he's going to have his hands full he's had some experience with hutchins so he probably knows what he's going to be going up against but yeah yeah oh that'll be great fun so that's that's set for november right you're doing that yeah yeah no probably yeah i most likely november yeah with
Engin Terzi: Roman SC Records, I will be first today. Super hello to super legends. And thank you, my friend Mario. Ask John about the progress of stem cells therapy. John, you only had one or did you just recently have the second one? That's where I was this weekend. I jumped on an airplane early, early, early, like 1 a.m. yesterday morning because I heard that Dave Chafee was going out to...
John Brzenk: to Maryland to get stem cells. And I thought, ah, well, he's there. I'll hit him up. And so it's actually been my third round now. So I got stem cells a second batch when I was at Travis's tournament.
John Brzenk: oh okay so this is the third one yeah this one i did the um the uh the iv so i did not only the localized area but i also uh got it systemically throughout my body so oh okay yeah no i felt great on the way home it's just a long ass flight to get back east from phoenix it was probably so i did that and then turned around and jumped on an airplane and made my way back home so i was like 15 hours uh flying time
John Brzenk: Wow, wow, wow. In the same country, 15 hours flight is just... Yeah, with three different layers, four different layovers. So it was a hectic day, but I think it's well worth it. I'm definitely noticing the difference. You know, it's taking its time. After the first one, I felt better after three, four months. But then it started to wear off where I was pushing it hard again, where it was starting to ache again. So, yeah, we'll see.
John Brzenk: I'm still dealing with that snowmobile injury. I have to laugh. It's like he was asking me yesterday, he said, well, where's the little aches and pains? Well, for sure the shoulder, but believe it or not, it's not due to arm wrestling. It's this damn wrist and thumb is still popping from when I overextended it on the snowmobile.
John Brzenk: I've been kind of treating that. The thumb's been feeling better, but the wrist is still, I don't know. He thought maybe I cracked a bone or something because of the way, you know, I didn't really strain it. I kind of just over compressed it when I jammed it down.
John Brzenk: And I mainly feel it when I'm hooking. When somebody hooks me real hard, it'll send a jolt of pain through my hands. The solution is clear. Don't get hooked. I definitely don't want to. It's the kiss of death to hook Hutchins anyway. So I think I'll be fine. But yeah.
John Brzenk: Yeah, doing well. It's good. Got to see Dave there. I think it was his first go with the stem cells. I saw some other armrests. Yeah, got a stem cell in the neck and a few spots in the arm. I think he was feeling a little aches and pains from the Devon match. But yeah, there was actually another armrest there, a couple other armrests. So it seems to be the thing.
Engin Terzi: yeah he did that's a very nice guy yeah maybe coming out yeah yeah yeah yeah i need to maybe i go with levan together you know oh there you go yeah yeah we need because yeah i think levan and i maybe in istanbul maybe we can apply but uh and him we will talk about what kind of visa we should apply for is it like a medical medical or
Engin Terzi: Like a competing like whatever seminar or I don't know, we will decide yet. The tourist visa and it won't I don't know how difficult it is to get into the States anymore, is it. Not I don't know last time I came to us was 2010 to 13 years ago yeah. And yeah.
John Brzenk: It's good to hear from you, John. It's good to hear and it's good that you know you are in good form and yeah. Things are going well with the arm wrestling. The promotion, the East versus West, still strong as ever in your building. I see your artwork and your
Engin Terzi: your marketing and all your things that you're doing is just keeps improving and getting better and better so John I mean it is one of the keys just discipline you know like once you say that oh okay I I did something great you know it is just like the moment that you will not progress anymore like same in arm wrestling you just go win like I remember a few times even when you won
Engin Terzi: You didn't like the way you won. You told me like I didn't enjoy so much. This is because you know how to arm wrestle at its best. And then when you cannot perform this, it doesn't matter that you win or not. The same thing happened to me. I went to world championships. I won.
Engin Terzi: And I was like, okay, like, yeah, but here, here and there, you made mistake. You need to go home and instead of, Hey, I'm more champion. You know, it is just like, you understand it's saying like, you know, it is just old mental thing, you know? Sure. Yeah. So we're on horse critics for sure. I mean, but other people will say, no, it was perfect. You did perfect. I'm like, eh, no, no, that wasn't perfect. A little off the tone was a little wrong. A pitch was wrong.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah yeah that is that is the way to progress you cannot progress once you are satisfied you know um the same with the east versus west i just want to do i just believe that our missing deserves that to be at the much higher places much
Engin Terzi: and better places and then I have the opportunity and then I just want to do my best and then see the result you know where it can go but but I'm gonna do my like I fail or not I will do my best until I fail if I don't fail I I will continue you know yeah I don't I don't see failure in your future I mean everything seems to be going in a positive direction things keep getting better and now you improve keep improving and building on what you've done less less uh match so
Engin Terzi: yeah good for you good for arm wrestling it's good for arm wrestling good for but the the key is unification my friend the unification when when they all we are just one world and when we are divided there there there
Engin Terzi: they they don't enjoy fans wants to see all the guys together you know no matter when i started to organize so many matches they are like you don't organize so many matches you know just we will be soon out of match out of excitement no more you give chances more opportunities more new stars everything the result will create something new expectations you know so
Engin Terzi: no need to be fear there are eight billion people and the mothers are always giving birth to the new new guys we saw just we have reno we have some new hopes they will be coming they just need opportunity right no i mean you're still you're stoking the fires of getting other people excited and motivated to do other promotions too i hear rumors that possibility of wals start back up and
John Brzenk: Of course, we have the king of the table and that promotions. Yeah, no competition is good. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. What else is new? Morals of Indiana, they are pulling.
John Brzenk: Yeah, Morozov looks so impressive with Corey left and then his after pulls right. I mean, he just looks like it's effortless. Like his hand and wrist has gotten so strong that, I mean. You have to control Corey like that, yeah. So well, I mean.
John Brzenk: Yeah, I mean, I and his hook is obviously top of top level. I don't I don't you don't see him moving as fluid and hard outside with his top role as he possibly could with his size advantage in his hand and wrist advantage. And so I think he's got room for improvement. I mean, he's going to be super dangerous once he gets in his brain that he can just, you know.
Engin Terzi: completely destroyed from the go. But yeah. Well, how do you see that with Gennady? I don't I don't I don't see Gennady. Gennady about the experience wise and well-roundedness is just above Ory level.
John Brzenk: The guy can just pull and he's aggressive. His endurance is second to probably. That's really weird that he's got that kind of crazy endurance. I mean, yeah, I've been in trouble and you said he would. I just thought there's just no way someone that that, you know, built that way, that big would have a big enough heart to pump enough blood through all those muscles to have that kind of endurance. It just it was shocking, actually, to me.
Engin Terzi: yeah every time i ask him what do you think about devon's endurance are you afraid and he is like when did you see me give up when did you see me having like bad endurance you know he always told me this but i still do not think that it was because like i don't know if i told you this before but devon
Engin Terzi: his endurance is in this way not in this way lately so when he went out and when gennady put his elbow out so devon had to go inside all the rounds and then when you pull 1 000 times outside and 50 times inside your endurance cannot be so it doesn't mean that devon's endurance is like like bad but it is just his inside so he needs to be better yeah
John Brzenk: he'll fix it. I truly believe I think Devin went into that match thinking that his endurance was superior to Gennady and he kind of
John Brzenk: pulled around a little bit or or allowed the match to go longer than it should have gone um because he felt like he could just destroy you know endurance wise Gennady and then he found himself in trouble and so I don't think he's going to make that mistake again I think he's going to be probably a lot more aggressive when he gets the advantage he's probably going to get more quickly with with the because obviously you got the advantage and it really rounds you know pretty convincingly so
Engin Terzi: I think Gennady is going to have to come back even stronger to have any success, Devin, that's coming for him. Yeah, John, round one, just remember, ready to go. And Devin took everything just right away. What came to your mind was it's over, right? It's a mismatch. I said it was over, you know. And Devin, as you know, his mind is focused on promoting success.
John Brzenk: the match as much as winning. And then, yeah. So he just, yeah. Yeah. And he said that this is also, he said, he said my ego, you know, and. Yeah. Nine times out of 10, that works perfect for him. He can, he can, you know, take his opponent out of position like that and then just bleed them to death where they're just completely done, you know, and that just wasn't the case with Gennady. So he's for sure learned from that.
Engin Terzi: But, I mean, Devon, he better not make the same mistake because I see something that Gennady is someone to not underestimate. You know, just like you can underestimate him. That guy is dangerous. You make a mistake, if you have opportunity, just beat the guy. You make a mistake, then he can, something is just happening and the guy is just ending up winning. You know, he was heavily underdog against many of those guys.
Engin Terzi: And then so, but just what do you think about if mortals have in Canada, if they go inside? Boy, yeah, no, if Morozov can't plow through them and kind of
John Brzenk: if he can't beat him right away, then I'm going to have to give go with Gennady, you know, I, but I just think Moore's office has, has looked so impressive in a hook. Um, if he, if he gets Gennady on his bicep, even if he can't finish, if he's, if he's holding, you know, Gennady where he's completely stretched out, I can't imagine Gennady hanging on to that for very long. I mean, Dennis is probably the only one with the bicep strength to be able to pull that off. So, um,
John Brzenk: But if Gennady's able to get, you know, his, his frame into it and get side to side and get stuck in the middle like that, then, then I think Gennady, but.
Engin Terzi: okay so you are saying that morozo needs to be an advantageous position yeah so that he can win if it is equal position you don't see gennady's yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but but you see the beauty of the sports there is jerry there is morozo yeah i think do you agree that
Engin Terzi: like i'm not saying like today's best like like past best or something but i don't remember super heavyweight category in the history with so many in the past when you look at there was you cleved in get a good reach just say alan carrer later but you will always see three four guys now
John Brzenk: you have like minimum 10 15 guys yeah 30 40 guys i mean i can say yeah you know who you know ravaz in the battalion i mean oh my god i can't believe that ravaz is like crazy he might be the top guy i mean he looks so i mean his hand and wrist is just ridiculous so yeah a lot of interesting matches coming up i mean we we might be surprised that the pecking order might be a little bit different than we all
John Brzenk: think it is right now we've got guys that are super super strong we're not even talking about so yeah no it's great it's it's nice do you remember ruslan rustam's brother i see that his brother is going to try to avenge uh rustam's loss against pauline yeah pauline that's fantastic i mean ruslan is not um that far away i mean i don't think he was ever as explosive as rustam but
John Brzenk: He's definitely got the endurance and he's got... Yeah, once he stops you, you remember that you pulled him at Zloty, you felt him a little bit, right? I think he's a monster, yeah. Paul's going to have his hands full with him. That'll be a fun match. So Paul better finish him quick, right? Exactly, exactly.
Engin Terzi: I love that. I love that, John. Now everyone is together and then we see all the best. I don't I'm not really interested like who is winning or not. But when I see the all those possible matchups and everything, it looks incredible. Did you see the last match? Go ahead. What do you say? The last match with who? The last match that I said, again, for Todd Hashings. Oh, against Sasha?
John Brzenk: Oh, I looked up that kid. I don't know much about him. Ibrahim Sago. Ibrahim Sago. Yeah. Yeah, no, I saw him beat, I saw some footage of him hooking and beating the big guy. Yeah, holy cow. I mean, and what I did notice is he's a committed fool, not almost, not even an inside hooker, but a shoulder roll presser. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: that could be very dangerous for or a tough um three months ago oh he did okay yeah but then he was they both were 209. this event uh 231 uh sago because they made a new category so ibrahim sago full 231 and so
Engin Terzi: Um, I, I don't know, it's, it's good, but I mean, if the match stopped somehow by Todd, then, then yeah. Todd will win. Yeah. But Todd, Todd has been, been known to get beat fairly quickly by really aggressive, efficient shoulder rollers. So. Okay. Michael Todd did, but Michael Todd is a heavier guy. Yeah. Who else? I remember him holding David Randall here and then.
John Brzenk: You remember that he lived in and Randall in the same event. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Hutchins. Yeah. Hutchins will have this. Yeah. He's got to be he's going to have to be awake.
John Brzenk: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah strength is side pressure and he's I mean he's built compactly enough where you would think he would have a really good ability to hold off that that downward pressure on the bicep that a shoulder roller can can put on you but it's actually one of his like weaker areas so
John Brzenk: it'll be do you do you think this if you start with good side pressure, you can take the shoulder pressures hang behind his arm or you think that you are exactly going into his power it's a hard transition to do an outside pull and then come in with a shoulder I think it's more effective if you really just stay behind it and really commit and of course it's it's that hairline fine line to whether or not you get behind it to hit it or.
John Brzenk: you feel uncomfortable enough where you have to back away from it because somebody hit you off center. So I think that commitment has to be there, like right from the go. I don't,
John Brzenk: I don't see too many people doing the outside and then inside effectively. It takes too much time. The guys like, especially like someone like Hutchins will capitalize on that. If you were at his corner, what would you suggest to him? Hutchins, just to be very alert off the go and hit off center. So it makes sense.
John Brzenk: absolutely sure that you don't get that pressure put on your bicep I mean that it's just all it's all about the you know the lights in the in the start you know you got to be like spot on when it hits green to be you know that's it could be all the difference in the world to be able to get it off center
Engin Terzi: Yeah, there is a super chat. Justin be yes, be Evgeny Prudnik versus on Garvey. Every match on Horizon would love to see that my friend Evgeny predicts right elbow is not ready yet. I am in touch with him all the time, so he's not ready. If he's ready, the next event he will be part of the event.
Engin Terzi: Trust me, I'm all the time in touch with those guys. He strained it with Devin? What's that? He strained it with his match with Devin. I hadn't really heard that he got hurt. I think, yeah, his elbow is not feeling good. He said something is wrong. But he said that the uncomfort was with him even before Devin match, he said. Okay. Yeah. And 3-4.
Engin Terzi: Tripp or Maradona and Pele of the sport. So lucky to watch. Thank you, my friend. And Paul Barrett. Engin, your love for the sport is contagious. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Yeah, that I can claim. I can claim that I love arm wrestling. John knows it. And so, okay, another one. Jerry versus Ermes.
John Brzenk: I think I think Ermes is strong enough. He's probably mentally well prepared enough to know there's a huge danger facing Jerry Catarat. So I don't think he's going to underestimate. I don't think he's going to go into the match, you know, overly confident. I think he knows there's a danger there. And because of that, and because of how good I think Ermes is,
John Brzenk: i see him being very well prepared to to uh not fall into the trap of jerry catarat but if he does and jerry gets his shoulder in there and he's in trouble in the center he is going to be in trouble everybody's in trouble yeah yeah yeah yeah i tell people people people don't believe the people so much underestimate jerry you can be jerry
Engin Terzi: but if if you don't make mistake and if you are strong enough but if you make mistake if he applies what he has then you will probably feel that the building is collapsing on your arm you know this is like on your brachioradialis especially and the problem is um he he you know you can be
John Brzenk: intimidated by jerry he is such a large figure and he feels so strong in the setup that if you if you let your mind go into the i'm going to go and protect and be going to the safe mode um and and again stretch him out and get you know negate that power that's when you fall in the trap yeah you fall in the trap you have to be aggressive and like match his his strength and then
John Brzenk: and basically go towards him a little bit with that side pressure. I'm not saying that Ermias should hook him, but Ermias definitely needs to go more forward than back with his great side pressure and top roll. Do you agree that if you don't face Jerry's strength at the beginning and then try to
Engin Terzi: choose the easiest spot and then you will feel something even more than what you feel at this center you know the next thing you will feel is even going to be heavier than what you feel at the beginning correct absolutely absolutely spot on and that's perfect yeah
John Brzenk: uh it's just it's just like I mean you know those guys everybody has to learn I mean everybody that's faced Jerry has walked away from that match going what the hell I thought I had everything I thought I was in a good position I thought I thought I thought but you know
John Brzenk: Then you, you start to, you know, you learn from your experiences or so. Hopefully that won't be the case or Ermes has done enough homework to, to understand that that's, that's a dangerous trap and that's not the easy route to, to deal with, uh, Jerry. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I mean, I dislike that people doesn't give credit to Jerry. I think he deserves the credit. And if Jerry didn't exist, who would be representing such people in the world? If I say, who is the best top roller in the world?
John Brzenk: in the history, 50% will say John, 20% will say Taras, 30%, 25%, whatever. But if you just say, who is the best flop risk pressure guy in the history? Who is the best flop risk pressure? Yeah, 95% will say Jerry. Yeah, for sure. He's definitely a unique style, unique character for the sport that even when you've perfected everything
John Brzenk: normal about arm wrestling it's nice to go up something against somebody like jerry that's just completely not normal not normal we've had some guys like that in the past i mean lupkus is another one i mean you just you felt like you knew arm wrestling you knew everything about it you knew all the angles and the pressures that you could you could possibly feel and then this monster shows up with this you know outside just tricep press and you're like what the hell how is that even possible
Engin Terzi: it it doesn't matter if you know or not something if you are not strong enough to handle then it just I mean really will not matter you know okay this guy is doing this but if you if you are not physically strong enough to handle if you don't know how to pull if you're not prepared it will not help you know to knowing is different being prepared against such thing is um that's a nice thing about arm wrestling there are people that
John Brzenk: types body types and styles that there's always that different pressure that you never felt before and and you can kind of yeah yeah anyway so hermes hermes is emerging star of our sports and then
Engin Terzi: very soon we will find out you know Jerry and him stylistically Jerry is always bad for the top rowers you know and but but Ermes is also something I think my opinion Ermes shouldn't arm wrestle with his arm Ermes should arm wrestle mostly with his wrist you know to control that ability more you pronate more you are on your bracket like
Engin Terzi: even when you are like this, even your bicep doesn't help at all. You are only on this muscle here. And Jerry loves that. Jerry just push the whole body and then press here. So, but when you, when you little bit more cup here, then if you can make Jerry hand looking up here, see, this is different than this. Now your tricep is working to this side. I mean, you cannot really, so. Right.
Engin Terzi: and and armies is very well yeah that's that's right he's got yeah he got he got the upper arm strength to really you know use more pressure than and you know he has the finishing move as well he has everything but this is exactly what you said that you know if he does everything right he has good chance to win but once you make a little bit mistake like
Engin Terzi: It may not. If you made a mistake at the table next round, you can do something better. But if you made a mistake during the preparation, you are not going to apply something you didn't prepare. So all he needs to do, do the right preparation at home. My advice to Ermes would be go in, take the chances of doing and going towards and decide to Jerry Block. Don't run away at all. And if you get beat,
John Brzenk: you get beat. I mean, it'll be an easier match to deal with to come back second round, third round, fourth round than it would be to be on the safe side and going outside and getting into the long drawn out, you know, war of the first round. I mean, it's, in my mind, better to go in and test what you think is going to be the easiest match to succeed with Jerry than going in and playing it safe and trying to outlast him because, yeah, that's a bad, I think that's a bad...
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah i i i agree with you that you need to be brave enough to really fight like not not choosing the easy way because easy way is the way that jerry is giving you and then and then he is hoping that you choose that way so yeah it'll be good
Engin Terzi: And what do you think about the, okay, we talked about all that, and then the Revas versus Laletin that they are going to pull in August.
John Brzenk: Ravas is, in my mind, maybe the best in the world right now. I mean, he's possibly the best in the world. We just don't know it. His last few matches have been so decisive and so nasty, aggressive that I'm very surprised if Vitaly is able to stop that. I think...
John Brzenk: does it matter which or without step I think Vitaly is the underdog um I don't know I haven't really seen too much of Rava's um uh top role in this in the strap if if it if it hurts his ability to really control and roll it seems like that's my doubts that this is why I ask you know because he didn't allow um
Engin Terzi: they have to go to strap right. So that's the thing. It'd be so ridiculously strong that he can just cop and control and top roll without the use of the strap. If he has that kind of confidence against, I don't think that he can do that because, because, uh, the low hand will always put some pressure to his little finger. I think even bad position or something, he will manage to go to, I think without the strap.
Engin Terzi: I believe Revas will be at the top for sure. But once the strap is put, I don't know if his wrist handles, he may even smoke. But if somehow he goes and then, you know, those low hand top roll,
Engin Terzi: that your your lower wrist you know you just think that you have everything but once you move you know you know do you remember when when when uh levan tried to go sideways round one against he almost lost his wrist he come back and he rise up and then he went that way i mean i think that everyone needs to do their homework very well you know for specific opponents you know like yeah
John Brzenk: But if we look at the matches, like we use Dave Chafee as a gauge, Dave against Vitaly versus Dave against Rabaz. Yes. Clear, solid favorite. And you are saying that probably even in this step, it wouldn't matter so much, right? It's how it looks. He's training with guys like Gennady that are super strong inside that I'm sure his side pressure game is...
Engin Terzi: is plenty well prepared enough to to hold and at least you know withstand anything that Vitaly could throw at him um yeah yeah the only thing is when both guys go outside in the strap if both have the wrist like this like uh they had power to do this because Lalitin doesn't have the cup but Lalitin still protects here so if Lalitin protects here against Reva's as well and
John Brzenk: Do you think that maybe Reva's success is so much dependent on his hand wrist control, but if his wrist is a little bit flattened like this, will he be as effective? I think he's questionably strong enough to even still out side pressure. Even if his hand and wrist are flattened out a little bit, from just what I've seen in the last couple of matches, I think that he will be.
John Brzenk: still super dangerous, super strong. So yeah, I don't know. I know. I can't I can't envision a way for Vitaly to come out on top on this match. Maybe if it goes in wrist to wrist. But then again, who let him let I think he doesn't do that. I mean, I guess my brain. Do you remember? Do you remember that wasn't that was with who took Morozov down to here?
John Brzenk: Ruben Duran- Round one I think if they go hook, I think that was gonna. Ruben Duran- be no I guess my mind is a little bit distorted with vitality hooking ability, because the way he destroyed the crack mirror. Ruben Duran- yeah that's definitely differently, you know these guys are. Ruben Duran- seen. Ruben Duran- By a lot of guys like that, so I don't I don't put a lot of. Ruben Duran- lot of yeah.
Engin Terzi: yeah i don't know i don't know i i really i'm um i i can't wait i can't wait to see how how these matches will go and i i said that again in iraqi for august 26th yeah i mean i i'm very curious to see how good
John Brzenk: David is in competition. I mean, he's obviously a monster. He's like lightning fast, just dangerous as can be. Puts monsters like Saplinkov out of position. Is he going to have enough hand strength to really just shut down the top roll of a Reckley? I mean, I'm super, I know what a Reckley is. I have no idea what David has. I mean.
John Brzenk: I mean, obviously super powerful, super strong, super fast. He normally commits to control the match. If his hand's ridiculously strong and his speed is what I think it is, he might have the ability to completely shut down. He might end up, you know, completely shutting down the top role of Miracle. Yeah. Do you see anyone else other than yourself beating Ongarbe at 105?
John Brzenk: I would like to see, I would like to see Todd Hutchins against Ungarbaia. I don't think, uh, Crittigale has ever felt the kind of raw side pressure that Hutchins will bring to the table. And it might be enough to, to beat Crittigale. I, I think Hutchins possesses more side pressure, um, than obviously Michael Todd.
John Brzenk: um and Michael Todd got a couple of wins on him so I I think I think pretty golly for sure is gonna put Hutchins out of position but I think that's a match that has to happen because I just think that uh yeah Todd is on a completely different weirdo level uh how do you see that like uh but then again putting against such a dominant win against uh Todd
John Brzenk: Yeah, because Prudnik knows how well he pulled Todd perfectly. I mean, he pulled Todd.
John Brzenk: outside on his bicep he went he went in this direction not this direction so he used a lot of copying to control his brain yeah you have to have a lot of upper arm strength to not only you know top roll todd but also not try to jam and take him to the pad sideways if you allow him to get you know sideways which prudnik does have i mean it's um even in a hook prudnik
John Brzenk: you know if you watch the match he doesn't pull like frame to frame sideways with todd he ends up pulling like like almost like dave chafee pulls outside on todd's bicep and i think that's the key to exposing and competing uh mr hutchins uh how about if brittany gets healthy and then makes 105 against uh ongarbe i was told that brittany was 112 kilo at the
Engin Terzi: Top eight while I asked what was his weight. I thought somebody told me it was heavy, but he said like 97 kilo. So if if what I heard is true, then there was like 15 kilo difference between those two if it was true.
Engin Terzi: and but imagine if they are 105 105 do you think that when they try to top roll on that we have top row prudnik and then he went inside and beat ongar where but i kind of think that ongar wave is also getting to another level when he is 105 you know just right yeah but i don't have any i'm sadly enough i don't have any real-time experience with the evgeny
John Brzenk: Yeah, I've never I've never like side pulled with him, never really practiced with him. I don't know what he's really all about. Justin all I can go by is, you know, his matches. I mean, his his hand and his commitment to hooking is on, you know, incredible. So, I mean, he's got a good top role. He's got obviously got a lot of cupping and a lot of hand strength, but he's he typically doesn't. He typically likes to just take it away and control the match and go with his arm strength and hook.
John Brzenk: Boy, I mean, just looking at past matches, I would have to favor Evgeny over Crittigalli. I think he's probably more of the favorite. Crittigalli, though, seems probably to have maybe better endurance. He seems to be able to pull at a super high level for a really long time. But Evgeny can also.
John Brzenk: If I was a betting man, I would say Evgeny's probably the favorite in that match. Unless, like you say, they're getting, you know, a light enough where it affects Evgeny Prudnik. But, I mean, hell, he used to be 75 kilos, 80 kilos. You would think he would be able to get in, you know,
John Brzenk: yeah he was 80 he was 18 19 years old you're talking about prudnik right yeah yeah of course yeah yeah so i mean he was super effective when he was only 175 80 180 pounds so i mean he's i don't think weight's gonna affect him too awful much
John Brzenk: hmm okay that's definitely a match that's gonna have to happen if if gany wants wants to make that happen and maybe we can lose weight and of course i think then evan will eventually salivate enough to to to lose that kind of weight that i think he can make 221 he can make 231 yeah i think so if he's motivated enough i mean if there's there's enough
John Brzenk: yeah if he wants to who would you who would you favor if he's 231 again Devin's ridiculous right now he's so strong if he can maintain even just 80 of the strength that he has right now um at 231 he's a clear overwhelming favorite uh against against anybody um but do you do you expect do you expect like uh not the score but at the table do you expect a domination or you think there would be a war I I
John Brzenk: I'd be honest. I think the only person that possesses maybe the ability to pop Devin, cause you gotta beat Devin fast. You can't, you can't just out maneuver and out control them because I asked the same, same thing to Ghana. He disagreed. I'm joking. Not really. Yeah. So in my mind, I think the guys that could possibly beat Devin are, are obviously Ermes. If he could lose the weight, I don't know how effective and strong he could still be at 2 31. I mean, that's probably a long way away from where he's at right now.
John Brzenk: But someone like arson, I would love to see arson come back to the sport. And I think his style and his explosiveness in the, in the direction that he's pulling or he used to pull would be a danger for, for Devin.
John Brzenk: He's got to manipulate the hand and wrist. Devin has gotten so ridiculously strong with his hand and wrist that it's really hard to do that top roll that Critic Ali has, or myself, even for that matter, of being able to take Devin out of position. You have to have the Travis explosive outside knuckles high to really, I think, to possibly get a win on Devin. So there's guys out there that I think potentially could...
John Brzenk: I heard Travis is training. Do you expect anything serious from him? I was there, what, four weeks ago? It didn't look like he was training very hard. He didn't look like? No, he was soft as hell. So I don't know where you're getting your information, but I don't even think he's dabbling in the sport. He looked pretty pathetic.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah um there was a question about the weight category of daddy kian exactly and uh pruning is 105. 105. it will be 105 yeah and yeah it's it is interesting yeah i i just can't wait what's that it's not hard for directly to make 105. david might have a hard time he might hit a little have a little bit of a weight cut right to make 105. yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: and and the next one i want to set is one 115 world title match in alijan murado with daddy cam with left arm okay yeah it would be you remember alijan right the classic guy yeah yeah left arm left arm yeah that's incredible yeah david's that good lefty that he's yeah it's even a match right
Engin Terzi: I mean, both are incredible, both a bit. I mean, I was like, can try to calculate as well. David, you know, did be more as I have a couple of matches and more as I've just whacked Corey. So yeah, it's hard. It's hard to even. In 2021, August competed there. I think Loto Shino event, he was 90 kilo. He won the first in overall, I think Morozov
Engin Terzi: Third, fourth in same category. But he wasn't the Morozov today, of course. Yeah, so young. But Ali Can is also very young as well. Ali Can is probably 25 or same, probably. This is, I mean, what I am thinking about him. Maybe 26 years old, yeah. And then, yeah. And then Levan is coming back. He said he already feels good. And then I think today, today he's coming back to Georgi. And then he will see his doctor. And after that.
Engin Terzi: he was in a he was in like dominican or something he said he's in a vacation he was oh okay yeah dominican republic or something i don't know i think i made it it looks like he's lost a little bit of weight he's he's come down off his whatever whatever he peaked at 450 or ish yeah yeah he looks a little healthier he looks a little leaner he's not so yes yes yes yes he took his lesson you know and i
John Brzenk: It'd be, it'd be a good test for him to, to see if he can be just as effective, you know, a hundred, a hundred pounds less than he's been, you know, I think a lot of that strength would probably stick with you. Um, but yeah, glad to hear that his wrist is, uh, not too badly injured.
John Brzenk: In a zero zero zero zero zero zero zero. I see that he's pulling again is he back healthy. I mean I think he he he rushed so early, I mean if you have a bicep you shouldn't pull in four months.
Engin Terzi: no no you shouldn't i mean i'm not saying that it's an excuse like that in one pair and square but i mean you have a bicep tear i mean you need to wait at least seven eight months you know you never had surgery never had any just just let it go they they they said that he had surgery i think so yeah this is what i was told yeah yeah well it seems it seems that michael todd's returning that quickly so i guess it's possibility i i
Engin Terzi: yeah we are we are crazy we are being would be ready michael michael already said that you know what do you think in in october i said michael please take your time because once you have injury from the same area if it repeats you know then then it is becoming terrible you know because we are not young we are not 18 20 or something you know and then so we really need to make sure that like we can wait three more months but we can come back
Engin Terzi: like more you know safely you know yeah yeah there's only so much tendon left you keep ripping it and they keep reattaching it there pretty soon there's nothing so yeah i think i think he's getting he's getting stronger this is what i see i don't i don't know he he posted usually this same pose like like i don't know and i really don't know if it's his old one or the new one you know and if it is the new one he looks already strong yeah
Engin Terzi: already strong just just you make sure you just make sure to stay in the sport till you 65 men we need it right yeah is that my new goal 65 65 i think i can we just stem cell everything and anything is possible just just choose
John Brzenk: choose matches you know yeah we'll see if all the hype is actually real and it allows me to stay in the game for that long that would be very uh very exciting and interesting to see we'll see yeah go ahead go ahead sorry no i was going to ask you about my my uh match with uh alexi he's looking oh yeah
Engin Terzi: Very formidable. He doesn't look like he's on the vegan diet anymore. He looks big. I don't know. I think Bobfin told me he was like 109 or something. Oh, okay. Yeah, this is
John Brzenk: It just depends on the angle of the camera, I guess. I've seen some pictures of him and some video of him pulling around, thinking to myself, whoa, he's not what he was when he pulled Tim. He's not what he was a year or two ago, where definitely his upper arm looks a little bit larger.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah yeah athletic guy i mean how to say naturally athlete you know i asked him first time i saw him was 2000 europeans just first time i saw him he was a new guy at the european in istanbul in uh we organized european chamber he took third place at 100 kilo and i said at that time how long had you been in arm wrestling and he said three months and i was like what three months i mean for the for the russia
Engin Terzi: I mean, you remember the level of the Russia, you know, especially on those years, you cannot just start armwrestling and then place top two in Russian nationals and come Europeans take third place. It's just like, I mean, it just shows that there is something special with you, you know, that
John Brzenk: Did you get in touch with him in Dubai at all? What's his goals? I mean, is he planning on taking on the world? I mean, being the top heavyweight again? I mean, I didn't talk so much. We went to dinner together, Bob and I, myself, you know.
Engin Terzi: we talk about a few things he told me about this kind of thing we talk from the past the memories and everything and then he i asked him if he's vegetarian or vegan or something he said he only doesn't eat meat but he doesn't consider himself he doesn't categorize himself like vegetarian or something he said he just prefers to not eat he doesn't enjoy you know
Engin Terzi: yeah and and you look at him he's just like you know i mean ready to sprint you know like the guy is just like i mean you see this naturally it's the athletic build guy you know he's over 40 years and you can see that the legs are not super big built this is as far as i shall get the short but the upper body is just like typical arm
Engin Terzi: are massive looking guy and i don't know so no hint on what hit what the future holds for him like is he going to continue to i think i think i can be he versus you will will tell like i will tell you something if alexi loses against you
Engin Terzi: I don't think he is planning to become the number one in the world in super heavyweight. I don't think he should try to beat Levan or something, you understand? But he still can try 115 kilo heavyweight. It's still possible for him. Even now, like the way he is, that I think that he should be focusing on 115 kilo or even 105 if he can make. I don't know his real weight. I don't know. What do you think about this? What do you think about him?
John Brzenk: i'll let you know in um two months if he's anything like he was and possesses the hand and wrist strength that he once had i mean i think he and you know he has the speed of a datacon i don't i don't see why he couldn't possibly mess up a lot of people's hopes and climb the ladder and be
Engin Terzi: maybe not the top guy, but one of the, you know, guys that we talk about as far as. It depends how he was 124 kilo when he won Zloty and he's 109 now just in that range. I am not sure if he can be as good as when he was at the Zloty tour. It totally depends on what he chooses, you know, but, but I don't think, I don't want to talk openly, but.
John Brzenk: i don't think he's gonna choose that path well i think this is what i understood from yeah the biggest obstacle for alexi is here like i don't hit i think he's still kind of you know um the ego the you know that i don't i don't know if he's got the mentality to just really just continue to grind and keep fighting and um i think he's more calculated
John Brzenk: and um yeah i think the mental thing will be the the tough thing for him to get to get through to trying to achieve that top spot who is this guy you know hey little guy he's small yeah fix your camera you look so small yeah yeah oh
Ermes Gasparini: yes jerry jerry is gonna eat you alive you know are you looking good man feeling strong thank you joe yeah okay i heard something you know when you're the name what is it you feel the air about jerry about me yeah
John Brzenk: Yeah. You excited? You're well prepared? You've been watching the videos? You got a you got a good game plan? You know? Yeah, I prepare everything. I prepare. Some people, they think I underestimated him, but it's not true. No, no. You not only need to be strong, you need to be mentally prepared. So.
Ermes Gasparini: It's the same when you fight Michael Todd. You don't know what you will do to win the match because Gerrard's style is very difficult to pull. If you don't know Gerrard the first time, it's very difficult.
John Brzenk: after this when you know everything is easy and it's still hard to find people to prepare yourself against someone like jerry because he's just a completely different animal i mean there's just nobody out there that you can even train with to simulate what jerry is going to do so it's it's tough i saw many videos about you because he continues to say if he continue to the
Ermes Gasparini: uh he won't wish you the last time it's not true he won't if he won't wish you in a show with the white t-shirt i don't know the very very long match three four fight right that was a ual yeah yeah you you had a glass yeah don't pull him like i pulled him that day that was wrong
Ermes Gasparini: there's better after these and after the when you would with the blue cheese show you won't and stayed stayed closer yeah with the bottom side of your hands yeah yeah yeah
John Brzenk: You block his arm. Then let him sit on my arm. Because it's tempting because you feel like you have such a good advantage that you could outlast somebody in that position. That is very tempting to want to do that just to prove that you're strong enough to
Engin Terzi: But Jerry, it's not a good idea. It's just not a good idea. There is a super chat. He says, Jerry could create a new wave of floppers, especially if he beats a current Devon.
John Brzenk: Do you see Jerry beating Devin or Devin beating Jerry, John? No. Well, Devin is smart enough to know the easy path against Jerry. So I think Devin would go into the match taking away a lot of Jerry's strengths. I mean, he just knows enough to know exactly where the easy route is for that match.
John Brzenk: Devin's way more prepared than 99% of the arm wrestlers out there to how to pull Jerry. Devin doesn't have to be any stronger. Devin mentally is prepared and knows how to pull Jerry. Let's see how it will be. Guys, is there any moderator to share the GoFundMe link to help Zurab
Engin Terzi: he broke his arm and in he has some serious expenses to cover you know or the surgery and the physiotherapy and everything uh is there any moderators they can share I saw the uh video of his Facebook or Instagram be nasty scar I mean
Ermes Gasparini: what did they put hardware in his arm did they require like i think they put i think they put platine with so many uh uh nails you know like i don't know how you call it they needed to remove after i have no idea okay because when they put the metal inside me here after one year they remove it in this because it's not very
Ermes Gasparini: For the joint is not good, you know, you feel pain there.
John Brzenk: I watched the match. I typically shy away from watching anybody that I know is going to get hurt. But I finally said to myself, I got to watch. I got to watch. I got to see what he... It didn't... From the angle that they have, it didn't look like he was in like crazy, silly position. It was... I don't know. This is very, very expected way to pull for Zurab. I watched it live. I just watched it live. After live, I saw many people posting. I didn't watch any of them.
Engin Terzi: um john um this both david samusha and zurab david told me that they are from batumi not from tiblis they took a long trip to russian border by the car and then they were made
Engin Terzi: to wait long time. So he told me that basically both David Samush and Zurab didn't sleep for two days before the competition. And then they arrived there and they pull without sleep for two days. Sometimes when you are not well rested, like your system, you understand, you become like vulnerable for anything, you know, like illness, arm break. And I think that Zurab also
Engin Terzi: making some weight cuts also to make 95. I don't know how much. I don't know. I don't know. It was just so unexpected, right? He didn't have any issues, soreness with his arm beforehand. It was just out of just. Yeah. Yeah. It's not the first time I heard like this with Ferit Usman. Yeah, Ferit and Gachevsky when they were traveling, I think because of what's happening in Ukraine, you know,
Engin Terzi: And then I think the traveling things sometimes hard, you know. And yeah, both Ferit and Gachefti also had to spend the night in the airport. And then they also went there, they are like exhausted, you know. And so, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Not only from here to there, but during the pandemic, the same thing happened when Zola was coming. When Zola was coming for the... You remember? He came in the morning of the event. He had to come early and then he arrived in the morning and then no sleep. He just went to full car hashings. So it is not only from here to there, but sometimes
Engin Terzi: from there to here as well, but that was during the pandemic. But I think the problem is at maybe the Georgi border, because Oleg was coming from Ossetia to Tbilisi. I remember he had many photos with the Georgi arm wrestlers day before, and then he was coming from, yeah, that's how it happened, yeah. Anyway, so, yeah. So, Ermes, you ready, my friend? Super, ready. Sure.
Ermes Gasparini: sure we're talking about you pulling a 230 class is it possible for you to make 231 in it the 105 kilo anymore what's your weight at right now now i'm um 125 in the morning okay so 275 pounds i feel more athletic you know more bread bread bread yeah the
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, the power is the same, the size of my arm is the same. And for me, it's not good to push your body and continue to push, push with the food and like when I was with Leiva. Maybe with this shape, maybe I do more.
John Brzenk: I have, for sure, I have more endurance. This is for sure. It's for sure give and take. You get the extra weight, you might be this much, little bit stronger, but you also suffer on the endurance. And the arm pump, everything in your arm just gives you so much water, sometimes unnecessary.
Engin Terzi: you were so big against devon in dubai after round one of course usually people have the same destiny against devon but i think your arm was also pumped but this the the the the setup was i i checked the setup once the bill put the strap round one the setup to say and then go it took five minutes
John Brzenk: I knew it might've been a, you know, a death wish for me, but I wanted to, I wanted to fight. I wasn't, I didn't want to give up to the, to the, the typical tactics, which I did. I felt okay. I mean, I wasn't going numb on the setup, so yeah. Yeah. With that. But yeah, you're right. The first match I was done. I was like, I need a cold bath or water. Cause I just can't, I can't feel anything.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, many people have the same destiny. Prudnik also had the similar experience after round one. If he will ever match with me, I will punch his face, I think. You need to be very explosive with him, but you know that. I mean, you can't mess around.
John Brzenk: Are you good at cutting weight? Have you lost 20 pounds of water weight before? Are you skilled in the dehydration? Because you could make the weight in a couple of weeks if you're really good at cutting water weight, right? I never do this cut of water.
Engin Terzi: i i think i think lowest he can make is 253 or some 231 impossible um but 253 if you train yourself to be able to do that obviously you know very well and good i mean todd hodges does it yeah yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: 40 yeah but this guy this guy feels that he put so much muscle he doesn't want to lose anything because he wants to be absolute best in the world and i think that he like he can do a little bit but he wants to be back like same as devon you know so he wants to be back to 125 and but it would be good maybe a category maybe i should change the
Engin Terzi: a heavyweight category up to 120 so that there will be a playing field for Alexey, Denis Triplenko, Ermes, Devon, you know, and then like only like
Engin Terzi: yeah okay okay so let's say 120 kilos yeah i mean i mean listen the goat is here and then and then the organizer here so if you say it's okay okay we asked john if he says yes yes john
Engin Terzi: just think about it if it was like 120 then then it will work you know like dennis we know that
Engin Terzi: like he has some he had some issues you understand health and everything i'm not sure if we can expect him to be the 140 550 but then i think i want dennis to be so competitive and then hit for the number one yeah and i don't think i think i think he realizes that he doesn't need to be that guy to be very yeah no yeah but we still want him to be part of this sport
John Brzenk: yeah no he's he's he's super super strong as a as almost as effective as he probably was when he was 20 kilos heavier so um and i think he's he realizes that so i don't see him getting huge yeah but like there are some guys like dennis alexey waruda yourself like community wants these people to be part of the arm wrestling
Engin Terzi: no matter what i mean they don't have to be the number one in the world as you used to be as dennis used to be i'm talking about the overall number one like as a fan i am okay that you are hitting for the 105 best guy i'm okay if dennis is eating 120 kilo something like best guy you know and um i i don't expect but if they want still they can try to do both category
John Brzenk: because 120 kilo is just a little bit below for devon is nothing for dennis is nothing for uh hermes is nothing these guys can still make it yeah and yeah yeah so you you you give permission don't yeah it's getting to the point where that's more exciting for the spectators to to to it's like the the race series where all the cars are exactly the same it's nice now to maybe put a cap on things where you don't have the guy that's
John Brzenk: 400 pounds, 500 pounds, 600 pounds. These giants that are walking through now. I think there's a place for that category where everybody's car is kind of the same weight. Very exciting. The important, John, the important is the quality, not fat. It's true, my friend. The quality, masculine, not the fat.
Ermes Gasparini: Look like Levan with me, 60 kilo difference, 60 kilo. Right. He's another person, 60 kilo. And like Corey West with Morrison, another 70 kilo.
Ermes Gasparini: But the real power is of your muscle. I think. You've proven it for sure. It's hard to get people convinced that, yeah, no, that extra 10, 20 kilos isn't probably going to help you. In some ways, it might hurt you. Yeah. If I want, I can go to 140, but I need to go to McDonald's every day like this and for what?
Engin Terzi: for what you know make it up the flight of stairs because yeah maybe maybe my power we go down right maybe for sure right no that is it in the second mission you were a little bit better lighter better shape ah yeah mario mario thank you for your super chat hermes greetings from albania my friend you are the new east versus west world champion on july 29th thank you thank you my friend
Engin Terzi: And SG Rokers 115 kg Ermes beats 115 kg Devon. Do you agree that? 115. Yeah, but we just made it 120, remember? No, 120. 120 is okay. 120, yeah. John, you gave the permission? John, tell me.
John Brzenk: Yeah, of course. Of course. Okay. I'm not joking. Okay. I'm not joking. You're going to be asking me about freestyle. The pin pads and elbow pads. What do you think? Yeah, let's do it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways. So, um, unless you want to say anything more. Oh, I'm very happy to be here with John and you and, uh,
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, that's good. What's next for you after Jerry's match? You have anything scheduled, Ermes? Not really, because now the focus is only for Jerry. After this, you know, the wrestling will change very fast. And before the MSC, as the super is the champion of Russia,
Ermes Gasparini: Now Vitaly is the champion. Now it's better to see Vitaly versus Revas. We'll see. After Jerry, for sure, we can make a decision. Right. There's a lot of things that need to be settled before you decide to go after him. Yeah, yeah. We'll see. Maybe Levan will come back for revenge.
Engin Terzi: We will see, we will see. Yeah, but if Levan comes back, he will have to pull Jerry. Why you? I know, but maybe, maybe Jerry will retire and we can't. Yeah. Ermes knows that I'm 100% joking. Ermes, tell your fans that, you know, tell them that I don't hate you. I'm just joking, teasing. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: yeah anyways john uh next month i wish you the best i also wish the best to tatashins both are my friends and then hopefully hopefully and then in september you have another incredible match can you imagine your shadow is like august 12th kakashi's september 23rd alexey voyvoda and most likely november kiddiger for the for the world title
Engin Terzi: yeah i plan to do something crazy for the november but without everything being finalized i don't want to uh talk because i like to do it i like to do it and then then choose yeah john
John Brzenk: Thank you very much, my friend. You're being our guest. I don't want to keep you. It has been one hour and 15 minutes. I know this is Saturday. I actually have a couple of guys coming over here shortly to do my Saturday training, my once a week. What time do you start? In about 45 minutes, if you said we've been an hour. They're coming over at nine, so 45 minutes.
John Brzenk: okay go go drink your pre-workout pre-workout that's right i should take some vitamin c so what is it beer beer beer no no not no i'm here now vitamin c uh uh gelatin uh stuff for collagen so tendons that's good okay yeah yeah yeah and what's your weight now john hey every video i show you with beer like this
John Brzenk: with your friends. Oh, that was back in the old days. Beer is good carbohydrate. It's good carbohydrate for the power. It helps numb the pain. It would motivate me more. I would pull longer when I was in kind of the party mode.
John Brzenk: You don't feel the, you probably are doing a lot of stupid things, but yeah, the length of the workouts were a lot longer when you're enjoying a beer or two. But I'm trying to stay completely away from that. I'm trying to stay clean. I can't handle that as much as I did even just five years ago. I have one or two beers and I'm like,
John Brzenk: I start running in the walls. It's so old I can't even handle it. I can't even handle one gear anymore. So it's just ridiculous. Your thumb is okay now? Thumb is better. The wrist through here is still, when I get turned down on a hook, it'll jolt. So I don't know what the hell is going on with that. But outside pulling is fine. The hand strength is fine. It's just still the jamming of that. Yeah, but when you do the cupping while you're pronating,
John Brzenk: is it okay oh it's not it's fine yeah it's it's when i get turned so there's something still in there that's not right but um i don't think it's a tear i think it's just maybe like a little little uh hairline crack in a bone or something that's still taking time to heal completely because it's weird but like i said they do the stem cell there in that area as well they did okay okay yeah
Engin Terzi: Um, I also, I also am coming back, John, coming back for 85 kilos, 187, but not the end of the year. You've already arrived. You're all, you look fantastic against Ray. So, I mean, you're, you're, you're in beast mode already, dude. We will see. I'm very hungry. I'm very hungry. I want to win 187, but I don't know. Probably I will pull the, the winner of the, um, the, the,
Engin Terzi: the Georgi guy that took second place at the AMC. I invited the first place guy, but he is, I think also he and Alain Zoller, Hajimura's brother, I think they both are going to the army university or something.
Engin Terzi: They both said that they cannot travel outside, but we will see. We need to start from somewhere. All right. Thanks, guys. Good seeing you, Ermes. Take care. Ciao, John. Don't overdo it. Thank you. Take care, guys. Take care. Take care, John. Thanks, everyone. Watch us. Thank you, guys.
