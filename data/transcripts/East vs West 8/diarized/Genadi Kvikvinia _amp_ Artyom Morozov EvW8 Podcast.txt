Engin Terzi: And again, if you have stem cells and TRT distro, everybody around 85 stem cell, anything is possible. Who came? Somebody just came, but I wonder who it is. Oh, it's Morozov and Roman. Hello. Hello, my friend. Hello. Now I need to focus on the guests. So sorry about it. I did my best.
Engin Terzi: Gennady Asokin. Hello, Gennady. Hello, Gennady, Gennady.
Engin Terzi: Opana, this is bullshit, Gennady. This is bullshit. You need to train like this. This is bullshit. Wait, wait, wait. He's saying that the way Artur showed him, how to do it, he's doing 17 kilos. No, no, I cannot hear at the same time you guys are talking. Justin wait. Okay, I got it.
Roman (Translator): So he said that the way Artyom showed him in the video how to do it, like the lowest angle, like 90 angle, he said that he's doing 70 kg with that weight. And he made sure that I would tell Morozov that he's screwed right now because Gennady is really, really well prepared. Gennady really, really what?
Roman (Translator): well prepared i would change well prepared no he's speaking russian telling him that he has a big problem
Engin Terzi: yeah it finally happened you you guys don't know how long time i'm trying to steer the pot you know i tried to tell them you know he's saying the turn of boris's camera he's getting upset and angry it gets translated
Roman (Translator): So, I mean, Morozov, you heard, he said that your camera, he wants you to turn off the camera. He hates you. He hates you. Well, of course, he's joking, but... I'm speaking now. Yeah, he's speaking Russian too now.
Engin Terzi: let us know what's going on you know let us know and there is one super chat i saw ask him thank you he says
Engin Terzi: Okay, so let's start. Gennady, after you saw the video Morozov made, you know, like, this is bullshit. Did you get upset? Morozov, how was our video? Did you like it? Did you like it? Did you like the video? Yes, I liked it, but I don't know what to say.
Roman (Translator): He's saying that Morozov also knows the necessary steps to take before the match, so he did not get that much angry on the video. Was that? He said that Morozov also knows why to do such videos, so he did not get that much angry. He said that Morozov also knows why to do such videos, so he did not get that much angry.
Roman (Translator): So he said that he knows the secret behind that video that Morozov showed. So he said that Morozov actually tried to do as much KEG as Gennady did, but he could not do it. So he dropped down the weight and he tries to record it like this and then properly because he could do as much as Gennady can. So he didn't get that much angle.
Roman (Translator): okay just can you tell this to him tomorrow i will try with my russian brother i'm not that good with russian as english
Roman (Translator): to heal your hand after the match. He uses this thing to heal your hand after the match, yes. Gena, are you training or something, bro? I'm now making my store's rack. Oh, I thought you were training. Yes, I'm training. Today I made a lot of things. You know, I'm already a master.
Engin Terzi: Okay, we don't understand anything. The people don't understand anything. Can you turn your camera?
Roman (Translator): Now he cannot think that now I'm in fit in the camera. Where have you been all this time? His shoulders were not fit in the camera, but now it's fit.
Roman (Translator): He said, yeah. So what they were speaking before was Artyom asked him whether he's training or what. And he said that he's actually training for this, some type of building thing with this screwdriver he showed. And then Morozov said, like, I thought you were training there. And he said that, no, no, I'm training enough for you to beat you. So they were just kind of going back and forth. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Okay, I understand. So, so it is more Gennady saying that Morozov cannot lift as much as he does. So that's why he chose to, you know, to do such a video with the lightweight.
Roman (Translator): I will also translate that to Morozov, I will try. Artyom, Gennady said that this exercise that you filmed, you can't do as much weight as Gennady can in this angle. Try it, try it.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: What I told you, Enki, now he's translating his Russian to Morozov. Now Morozov understood what he understood. Okay, okay. What does Morozov say?
Artyom Morozov: Morozov, say something. I don't know. It's just fun to watch your conversations. Of course, I won't try it with this weight. Why do I have to do this? It's your ligament, you did it. It's your ligament, you did it.
Roman (Translator): So he said that to answer Gennady, he said that I don't need to do such weights. Obviously, I'm not going to do it because he meant that it would risk some injuries because he told him not to do like this, but like this. So he said that I will not even try to go that much high because he knows that it's going to be dangerous. Is this useless? Yeah, that's what he said. But then...
Roman (Translator): Then Gennady told him that you cannot do that much weight as I do because for such a weight you need specific type of joint strength and specific inhuman type of joint strength. And he said that you cannot do it basically. Can you ask Gennady why he cannot stay still? What's wrong with him? Did he just drink pebble coffee?
Roman (Translator): Artyom, Gennady, why are the doors not in place?
Roman (Translator): he's saying that he's eager to fight right now he wants to put right now he's ready right now he's been prepared warmed up and now he wants to engage and do yeah i mean he looks he looks so huge
Engin Terzi: Artyom said that Gennady is preparing to dance somewhere else. He's about to go somewhere and dance or something. Looks like either he's listening to music or something or he needs to go to the restroom. Or pre-workout, he drinks and he just can't wait. Or he saw Morozov and he just wants to destroy him.
Roman (Translator): Yeah, I will translate all three options. So Gena, she has a question. He was in the toilet right now, so that option is out. Only two left.
Roman (Translator): So he said that obviously this toilet is already done. So that option is out. He said that he's going to dance right now. I guess after this stream, he's going to dance. And then he said that he doesn't even need to warm up for Morozov, to beat Morozov. Yeah. Okay, okay, okay. Morozov.
Engin Terzi: I know that you don't want to talk tons of shit, but honestly, honestly, how do you see your chances, winning chances? Like how much? Yeah. Artem, you understand? Translate, translate. He said that...
Roman (Translator): He thinks that you are not a fan to do this trash talk, but he said that, in your opinion, honestly speaking, in your opinion, how do you think, how many chances do you have against Gennady? Well, I, Gena, out of respect for Gennady, well, I think that we have 50 to 50, but in the depth of my soul... How 50 to 50? You are still a young man. How 50 to 50? It can be in 5 years.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: But in the depth of my heart, if you take away, if you take away, if you take away, if you take away, if you take away, if you take away, if you take away, if you take away,
Roman (Translator): with the honesty, like he said, for the respect he has towards Gennady, of his appreciation and respect, he said 50-50. And then Gennady, obviously Gennady understood the Russian, and he said, like, what type of 50-50 are you talking about? I'm going to destroy you. Then Morozov smiled and laughed, obviously we saw, and he said that, like, for respect, he said 50-50, but honestly, in his mind, he thinks that it's 100%, he's going to crash Gennady.
Roman (Translator): And then Gennady said that, no, no, just admit, say the truth that it's 60% for me and 40% for you.
Engin Terzi: and maybe in five years maybe you can beat me or maybe i know he said maybe that 50 50 maybe in five years that's what gonna be told me okay so morozov said 50 50 and gennady said come on like you know that i'm gonna beat you and then morozov said that's only because of the respect but normally morozov says that he's gonna win 100 percent again okay i understand yeah wow that's good
Engin Terzi: But Genadi, why do you think that in the armwrestling community, they think that you have 20% chance? Like 80% of the people, Morozov is going to win, they say, and 20% only say you're going to win. Why do you think this is? Gena, I want to say that these people think that there is no way to win.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: 80% of the people say that they are from Morozov. The people of Rodi are from Genadi-Muigevskoye. Rodi is from Rodi. The people of Rodi are from my people. They are from Morozov.
Roman (Translator): Artem, I will translate it into English and then I will try Russian.
Roman (Translator): So he said that, Enki, to answer your question, he basically asked you a question. When do you remember last time people said that Gennady would win from those polls? There is only one time, one time, yes. It's against Jerry. But that's what he lost. That's what he said. He said that, like, against Demler, everybody said that I would lose. Against Michael Todd, everybody said I would lose. Against who was there, he said,
Roman (Translator): Morozov is saying I would lose. They only supported me one time against Jerry and then he lost. So this is a good sign, good sign for him. Let people support Morozov. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I will try to briefly translate this to Morozov. He said that he doesn't have a problem.
Roman (Translator): He doesn't have a problem even if all the Georgi support Morozov. Because actually it's a good sign when people support the opponent of Gennady, then Gennady will win. Yeah, yeah. So he has no problem. He says that in any ways he's going to destroy Morozov, right? Yes, yes, yes. Tell him this. He's ready right now.
Roman (Translator): What you just said, I will translate. He said he doesn't care about what people think he's going to destroy Morozov anyways, right? That's exactly what he said, yeah. Yeah, he said this, he's going to destroy Morozov? He's going to eat his arm off.
Engin Terzi: oh like eat eat alive his arm off okay so so his his bicep okay how big your bicep is now morozov how many something right bicep 53
Roman (Translator): So after Gennady is, he will be 40 something. Artem, Engel told you that after the match with Gennady, your biceps will be 40 something. Because Gennady said that he will bite your hand. No, no, after the match with Gennady,
Roman (Translator): He said that actually, no, you're wrong, Engin, because after his match versus Gennady, his weight, Morozov's weight will increase 140 kg because he's going to be eating Gennady. Wow.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: That's the kind of trash-talk from Artyom Morozov. A good trash-talk. That's the kind of trash-talk from Artyom Morozov. A good trash-talk. A good trash-talk.
Roman (Translator): So Morozov said that this is my type of trash talk, like good friendly trash talk. And then Gennady said that what type of friendly trash talk? I will teach you trash talk.
Engin Terzi: Are you speaking Russian now or Georgi? No, Georgi. Georgi. Sometimes Georgi, sometimes Russian. Tell him to speak Russian so Morozov doesn't need translation and you can translate to English only. That's genius actually.
Roman (Translator): Gena, I want to know what do you think about Russia? Because I think that you will never be able to get rid of Morozov. And I think that you will never be able to get rid of him. I will not get rid of him. Not now, like before. Because I started in 1929.
Artyom Morozov: After the 29th, you can, like each other... That's it, that's it, Gena, I got it. Then let Engin call the ambulance and the police, because I'll go to the hospital, and you'll need an ambulance, bro.
Roman (Translator): Justin let him translate, translate. Sorry. Sorry about that. . First, again, Gennady also could not hear internet problem, so I will translate what Morozov told him.
Roman (Translator): Gennadis, this is not a crime, this is my police, because last year I was arrested, I was arrested. I was arrested, I was arrested, I was arrested, I was arrested, I was arrested.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: He's crazy. He's getting crazy. Justin wait. Many people are waiting for translation. Tell me.
Roman (Translator): uh so i told him that to let me translate to uh so what uh what gennady told artom
Roman (Translator): was that we cannot be friends, I will teach you to fresh talk, we cannot be friends until 29th, and after 29th we can be friends. Before that we are enemies, fearless enemies, right? Then Artyom told him like, okay, okay, everything is clear, but he said that, he told me and also to, for Gennady, he said that tell Engin to, after this, for this event, call emergency and police because I'm gonna,
Gennadi Kvikvinia: be going through the jail because of uh taking care of kennedy you know that's what he said okay
Engin Terzi: No, he's speaking Russian. Okay, what did Gennady say first? Tell Gennady that if he doesn't understand what his translation is, it doesn't matter how many things he talks about.
Roman (Translator): Yeah, I'll translate. OK, just tell me. Tell me. Forget about it. Yeah.
Roman (Translator): Yeah, okay, I'll wait, he said. So he said that he will take the video in response to Morozov's last words. He said that he will take now his upcoming video, will prove that all this, whatever Artyom is trying to do and reach and to get himself in the mindset, nothing will work. And he said that
Roman (Translator): He will teach him the lesson, he will teach basically what Morozov told him. He said vice versa, I will teach you to do this and that after the video. So he mainly was focusing on his upcoming video to show Morozov what's up in the video that he's about to post as a response of Morozov's last video.
Engin Terzi: okay so that's what it is okay i understand and and i just started the poll to see what people think who's winning and um like he said that artom said that you know he's gonna he's gonna go probably jail you know after what he did to gennady like like and what can be that bad that morozov is gonna do to gennady
Roman (Translator): Artem, Enki understood what you said about the ambulance and the police, but he said that in more detail, what do you mean? What will happen to Gennady? Why do you think so? I will eat him.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: And I will be sent to prison for life.
Roman (Translator): So he said that because of I'm going to eat Gennady alive, so it will be like a killing person or something. So they will put me like life sentence into jail. That's why he said that police will come. He's going to eat Gennady alive. And what does Gennady say?
Roman (Translator): so he said that after match he will uh let uh artyom to put his head on his chest like this and like a little little kid and saying it's no it's okay it's all right maybe next time you maybe next time
Roman (Translator): He's saying that like past two months he's been live almost every day, entire two months. So there is no way that Arjo will beat him in this type of live things. He's been live every day.
Engin Terzi: Which is actually true. Every day if you want to see Gennady, what's up with Gennady, just go on his TikTok. He's live there promoting everything. Yeah, okay. He's live there every day. Yeah, I don't know. Artem, are you going to really, really beat this guy? He looks very hype. You just can't stop, you know. Can you really beat this guy? He looks very determined. He's not scared of you.
Artyom Morozov: Do you really think that you will win, Gennady? Yes, well, damn, I think he starts early. I'm resting now, I'll start there, but he's early. Early, brother.
Roman (Translator): okay okay so he said that um it's it's all big all because canada is like too soon canada started being hyping up right now artom is just chilling you know enjoying his uh resting time but when time comes he will be angry and hyped and everything and then and then again again they will be like this and then competition time morozov will be like you know tell me he will hold him like and tell me who is the greatest
Roman (Translator): Gennady, I will translate this to you. Gennady, as I said, I don't want to say that I don't want Gennady to be angry with me, to be angry with me, to be angry with me, to be angry with me, to be angry with me, to be angry with me, to be angry with me, to be angry with me.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: But all these people, even if it's a little late, when they get on the train, they go back to where they came from. Yes, that's right. They go back to their homes, to their homes, to their homes, to their homes, to their homes, to their homes, to their homes, to their homes.
Roman (Translator): What he said is like the entire armwrestling world and like entirely nobody has as much energy as Gennady does. And he said that even after 48 hours of not sleeping, he would just go to the table, pull at him as if it was like fresh, nothing. Yeah. And then he would still beat him? His energy is just limitless, basically. Yeah, he would beat him even 48 hours of...
Engin Terzi: he's saying that really i'm seriously he maybe people think that i'm lying but seriously yeah but tell him to get good rest you know for the competition don't test it before art too much we don't want to we don't want any disaster you know we want to see best of uh gennady and morozov artem who has better endurance you or gennady
Roman (Translator): But I'm much younger. I think I have more endurance. Wow, okay. He said that because of the young, how younger he is compared to Gennady, he said that he would be more durable. Of course, of course. Gennady is old and he is young. Okay, yeah.
Roman (Translator): after he's saying that ask devon how endurable canada is enter the courses with devon to know how enjoyable canada is
Engin Terzi: Yeah, take the course. Okay, so everything Morozov said, Gennady understood anyways, right? Yeah. Silke Wilke, Roman, when you ask Morozov or Gennady a question, can you translate to English first for the chat? Unless it is English question, but I think you are only asking them my questions, right? Yes, yes, I don't ask them my own questions, Silke. Okay, okay, yeah.
Roman (Translator): And Artyom, are you more confident for the early rounds or the late rounds? Artyom, do you remember what he said? How are you more comfortable before the start of the match or when it ends in the 5th or 6th round? When are you more comfortable?
Artyom Morozov: Well, it used to be comfortable in the last rounds, when I was already warmed up. And now it's comfortable from the first rounds, I rest well and train so that I can turn on in the first rounds. I'm trying. Okay, so he said that from the beginning of his armwrestling career, he meant, it was usually getting better as the match went on.
Roman (Translator): he said that like last rounds he was already warmed up and stuff and he that was previously that was better but now he's saying that as he progressed and stuff like fresher he is at the match the more capable and more productive he is
Engin Terzi: Okay, can you ask Gennady also the same thing? He thinks that he is going to win. Does he think that he can win right from the beginning? Or you think that because of his endurance and well-roundedness, being versatile, is going to help him to win? Okay, Gennady, I have a question for you.
Roman (Translator): He keeps saying that even first round Artem will be already tired like dead on his biceps.
Roman (Translator): he like he will finish him already in the first round so i guess it means that a lot more round goes on it will be even easier probably not okay because he will finish morozov in one round he asked to wait how much weight how much do you weigh uh he said and uh
Roman (Translator): So Artyom answered that he is 135 kg, but then Gennady said, don't lie. I know you're 130. Don't add those 5 kgs. I'm not going to lie to you. I'm not going to lie to you. I'm not going to lie to you. I'm not going to lie to you. I'm going to lie to you.
Roman (Translator): uh-huh so he said that um you understood what i said right here artem said i'm 135 yeah yeah yeah yeah and then he said that my uh my goal is to actually uh curl artem's weight like he meant 130 kg and then he said that even if artem will uh like uh pull or hold his weight on
Gennadi Kvikvinia: Artyom also understood what I just said, yeah. Okay, okay, okay, I understand, yeah. Artyom, if you beat Genadi, will you say, opana, or no? Budu, Budu, Budu. If you say, opana, it's a big deal. I'll say it, I'll say it. Do you remember how you were there, Lara? Do you remember? He said, opana, and then he died.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: I will translate, thank you. I'm not forgetting anything.
Roman (Translator): So I'm just letting them to actually go at it and then I will translate. So he said that about your question, obviously he's gonna, he said that I will do, so he meant that I will scream upana and then Gennady immediately fired up, he said that you remember, you remember what Devon said, Devon tried and I told Devon not to scream that or else I will get fired up and more powerful, you know, and you saw that's what happened, that's what Gennady told to Morozov and he said that
Roman (Translator): morozo then said that during your match versus devon i was screaming opana to support you you know just just like this and now i'm not gonna support you in this match and gennady said it doesn't matter if you scream opana i'm gonna be getting better so it's gonna be tough days for you don't scream open now whatsoever
Engin Terzi: Can you ask them, do I need to bring any security, extra security during their visit? Ask in Russian so they both understand.
Roman (Translator): Yes, yes, yes. So, Artem, you said about some kind of security, how to say, protection. Yes, yes, protection, so that everything is under control. Will it be needed or not? I think it won't help anyway, even armed security. There will be a war.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: Artyom said that even if they will be armed with weapons, there will be a war. War is coming. Artyom said. Artyom said. Artyom said.
Roman (Translator): he said that before before today he was usually working out two hours you know daily like when when he was doing a workout session but he got so so fired up so angry so upset so mad like so in the action right now because he sees morozo he wants to crush him like this and he said that he's gonna train four hours now like two times more
Roman (Translator): Okay, so he realizes that to beat Morozov, he needs to be stronger. That's how I understand.
Roman (Translator): He's saying that he's angry and he needs to actually use up this energy that he's bottling up. He's saying that Artum is clearly scared of him because why he's not talking anything?
Roman (Translator): Artyom, he said, why are you silent? He wants to hear your opinion. He will praise you when you don't say anything, he will give you nothing.
Roman (Translator): I understand that he wants you to say something. Trash talk, good trash talk, bad trash talk. Justin say it. What can I say? I just want to fight. I want to win and that's it. This is a joke. We won't do it. I want to win. We won't do it. It's a joke. Okay, okay. I won't say I want to.
Roman (Translator): I'm waiting for the day when I win, that's what I'll say. Okay. He said that, I mean, what else should I say? Borussia said, like, I'm just, I'm just, can't wait to beat, can't wait to pull Gennady and beat him. And they said that, like, Gennady told him right away in Russian language, said that it's not gonna be that easy, just like you can't wait to beat, it's not gonna be that easy. And Artem said that,
Roman (Translator): so okay just i will tell tell that i'm waiting for to go there and just destroy beat canadian that's it he did not say like i cannot wait our match he said like okay i will say i'm gonna i cannot wait until i actually beat ganad yeah yeah that's good that's good i don't know i can't wait like he asks for you to wait thank you
Gennadi Kvikvinia: Gennadiy Shekliak, I want to ask you something. One more time. Who is more comfortable, me or you? Who is more comfortable? I think you are more uncomfortable. Yes, I'm uncomfortable. I've already started to fight. I don't have such character.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: No, no, there's just a saying, don't say gop until you jump over.
Roman (Translator): Okay, I will translate. So Gennady asked Morozov, that's why he asked you to wait for this one, because he had a question for Artem. He said that, tell me Artem, what do you think, who is more, like who is less comfortable opponent for you? So who is more uncomfortable to you, me or Levan, he asked him.
Roman (Translator): and he said that artom thought about it he said that i think i believe you are more uh uncomfortable for me that's what artom told gennady and then gennady said yeah obviously because i'm already starting to shoot some fire you know he but he they spoke russian so they both understood each other and then also gennady said that don't don't be sitting there like this and only just say that you just want to win just just say that what what i'm doing also you're gonna do it even better or something like this he just also wanted to fire up and stuff
Gennadi Kvikvinia: and uh basically he said that uh obviously i'm gonna be uh less comfortable for you than uh
Roman (Translator): He said that he would not be able to say it precisely in Russian, so he spoke Georgi. He said that every opponent of Gennady's, before match, they believe that they can beat him. But once they see the face,
Roman (Translator): of gennady when they are at the table against each other all these power their power just goes somewhere else they just dissipate in the air somewhere so he meant the same thing will happen to artem no matter how much he believes that he will beat gennady once he sees gennady his face do you understand yeah he says i know you have some english artem you have some powers
Gennadi Kvikvinia: now it's okay but when you go to the table east versus west you see gennady and then you start shaking your power is
Gennadi Kvikvinia: Georgi Guari?
Roman (Translator): He's Georgi Romanadze, so he's somewhat close to my name. So he is Gennady's student right now and I will explain why he brought him up. He said that
Roman (Translator): The reason why everybody thinks before the match that they will beat Gennady is that when he stands next to those opponents, like these arm wrestlers, elite ones, such as Morozov, Devon and everybody else, he's saying that basically I'm slightly smaller than them, so they are kind of looking down on me, something like this.
Roman (Translator): and that's why they have such an impression that oh man it will be easier or something but once they pull their arms like once they like grip up then they don't expect my arm lengths to be that long so that all those uh arm wrestling necessary uh parts are getting uh puzzled up to each other and it paints the picture of those opponents for those opponents and they just scared away and
Engin Terzi: Gennady, this month you're going to pull Morozov. Next month you're going to pull Devon. Do you believe that you will beat both of them? If yes, which one will be harder?
Engin Terzi: He said, no, no, no, there's no way he's going to beat me. I'm going to be the one beating Devon Larratt next time. There's no way he's going to beat me. No, no, no, I didn't say that he will beat them. I said, if you think that you're going to beat both, of course he's going to think he's going to beat. But which one do you think is harder opponent will be?
Roman (Translator): Devon in August or Morozov in July? Which one will be harder? Okay, I will translate with Gennady. Gennady, I would like to ask you a question. You said that you were going to meet Morozov and you were going to meet Devon in August. Did you know that you were going to meet both of them? Did you know that you were going to meet both of them?
Gennadi Kvikvinia: Say in Russian. Say in Russian. Say in Russian. Say in Russian. Say in Russian.
Roman (Translator): So he said that he will tell you that later because right now before they have not had match him and Morozov he cannot say precisely but he said that what I believe is like I believe that they are just told he meant both him and Devon they are just told they are not that strong
Roman (Translator): They are just tall. They are just tall in that seat. He said that this is not a basketball or something. Why are you always saying that taller guy will win? It's not a basketball, he said.
Roman (Translator): But I know he didn't pull Morozov, but which one he is concerned more? Which one he thinks that is more dangerous? OK, I will ask that way. Russian. He really doesn't know, actually.
Roman (Translator): He really doesn't know. He said that he just knows that he has to beat both of them. So, let's see. He cannot say that Artur will be harder or Devon will be harder. He cannot say that. I understand. So, Morozov. I want the pizza. Margarita. Pizza. Pepperoni.
Roman (Translator): He said that he will beat Morozov and then to get their friendship back, he will buy him some pepperoni pizza because he knows that's Artem's favorite pizza.
Engin Terzi: He will buy the third one if it's after the game. I understand. I understand. Yeah. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. And Artem, after you beat Gennady, will you also spend time with him and teach him how to train properly? Gennady, I am much more...
Roman (Translator): No, I asked Artyom. I asked Artyom.
Engin Terzi: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, Engin. I was reading the comment. Okay. Sorry, Engin, my apologies. Artem, Artem, forget, forget. Artem, after you beat Gennady, will you teach him how to train properly? How to do good training? You will teach him? Yes, yes. And you will do that for free? Free? No money, right? Free? Free, free, yes, free. Okay.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: From respect, from respect, just from respect. How many mistakes do you make? How many mistakes do you make? I make videos, I make videos. I usually say, what do you make, what do you make, but it's a mistake. When you make a mistake, you will have a big problem.
Roman (Translator): So he said that he understood what Morozov said, that he would teach Gennady armwrestling for free. And Morozov said, from respect, he's not going to take any money from Gennady for that one. And then Gennady said that, do you even know, do you even watch your own armwrestling videos? Do you even realize how much mistakes you do? You know what, I'm going to record the video and I will teach you, explain those mistakes, every mistakes you do step by step.
Roman (Translator): and he said he spoke this russian so art was so uh understood okay kennedy will film the video but not teaching arm wrestling but how to train properly this is what i said yeah yeah anyway so
Engin Terzi: Okay, let's talk about something else. I can wait. You guys are coming early. We will have some Istanbul scene, maybe the sea together with maybe on a boat or something. Anyway, so what do they think about Ermes versus Jerry match?
Roman (Translator): What do you think about Ermes vs Jerry? Let's start with Artur. I think Ermes will win if they don't give the center.
Roman (Translator): He said that he thinks Ermes will win as long as he maintains the center, as long as he's not going to give a center to Jerry, then Ermes will win. So, Engin, you understood Artem's opinion, right?
Roman (Translator): He said that he believes that Ermes will win as long as he's not going to give away the center. And now Gennady said that I have competed against both of them, so he wants to tell his own story about his opinion. Okay, so he says that Ermes is going to win if he doesn't lose the center. That's what Morozov said, yes, yes. Okay, yeah. Gennady, go ahead. I have two options. I have two options. I have two options. I have two options.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: However, when I look at Deuce's and Gasparini's work, there are several variants of this kind of work. For example, in the case of Gasparini's work, there is no doubt that he was very good at this kind of work.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: OK. So he said that speaking of his own experience against both of them, he said that
Roman (Translator): Ermes is obviously, even though Ermes gained much more after his match versus Gennady and after Dave Chaffee's match, Ermes' match versus Dave Chaffee, he said that by roughly the power levels, it would be for Ermes, it would be roughly the same as it was him versus Dave Chaffee. So he's saying that Jerry's match on power level would be somewhat close to what was
Roman (Translator): against Dave Chaffee for Ermes and he said that it's not gonna be like clearly easy victory for Ermes but he said that first two rounds it will be easy like dominant enough from Ermes side to say like recently he beat first two rounds so he but after that if his endurance is not high enough
Roman (Translator): He will definitely lose all three against Jared. So he said that it's crucial for Ermes to have good endurance after second round is done. First two rounds, Ermes will be in quite a dominant fashion, like no questions about it. But after that, it's endurance game for him. And there is a chance that he may lose all three.
Engin Terzi: So, okay, so he's saying that Ermes will start better for sure, stronger, but is this totally up to his endurance to win three rounds? Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. And can you ask Gennady if he beats, if he wins,
Roman (Translator): against Morozov. Yes. And he also believes that he's going to win against Devon. What does he think about his chances against Ermes? Gena, I have a question for you. What do you think will happen between Morozov and Devon? If both of them win, if both of them win, what will happen?
Gennadi Kvikvinia: In your opinion, what is the potential match between you and Ermes? What are your chances? I believe that if these two matches happen, I believe that I will be able to win, no matter what the odds are. If these two matches happen, I will be able to beat Magachor and win against Muzarat and Parz. Who will you beat, Ermes or Jerry?
Gennadi Kvikvinia: OK. So Engin, it's a kind of
Roman (Translator): he's uh he's asking for for you to set this match up he's saying that uh not necessarily against ermis he said that if i'm able to uh beat those uh two opponents such a great opponents like morozo and devon larat he wants to actually go against the winner between ermis and jerry for the title man and then the thing is against who he has a better chance jerry or ermis
Gennadi Kvikvinia: Okay, I will ask that question. But first of all, who do you trust and whom do you trust the most? With whom do you trust the most? With Ermes or with Ger? I will tell you one thing, and then I will tell you the rest. I will tell you what I think about Levan. I think that Levan does not have a leader like Ger and Shemosuli. I think that Levan does not have a leader like Ger and Shemosuli. I will tell you what I think about Levan.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: I am interested in the relationship between me and my wife. But if I have to choose between these two, I will choose my wife. Because if I have to choose between a wife and a husband, I will choose the one I want to marry. I don't have to worry about everything. But this is your chance to choose between a wife and a husband. I have two options. I will choose the one I want to marry.
Roman (Translator): 50-50. Okay. He said that a lot of stuff. He's live also promoting this live stream right now on his TikTok page. And he said that
Roman (Translator): they are both equally very challenging matches for him versus jerry and versus hermes he cannot say clearly one guy one match would be easier than the other but he said that it would be anyways uh pulling either of those guys it would be like a revenge match for him because he has pulled both of them in previously and lost so it would be for him it will be still really really meaningful and um great to compete against them and he could not say i guess 50 50. yep
Engin Terzi: And Artem, and you, like, do you, like, you believe that you're going to beat Gennady, right? Yes. Yes. Okay. And after you beat Gennady, are you ready for a title match against the winner of Jerry and Ermes? Yes, yes, I am ready. You are ready? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: And what do you think about your chance against, just say, against Jerry and what's your chance against Ermes? What are your chances against Jerry and against Ermes? In your opinion. I think Jerry has more chances than, for example, Ermes. I think Jerry has more chances.
Engin Terzi: He's saying that he thinks his chances against Jerry is higher than his chances against Ermes. But does it mean that his chance against Ermes is less than Ermes' chance against Morozov? Or it is only he compares his chances against both athletes? Like if he just compares, you know, he and Ermes, what percentage does he give to himself and what percentage he gives to Ermes?
Roman (Translator): Okay, he understood what you said, but he's asking about your chances against Ermes. What do you think? Now I'll say that...
Roman (Translator): Okay, he said that right now I'm not going to start trash talk against Ermes, so I will say only 60% to 40% in his own favor.
Roman (Translator): But once the match is set, then he will say it's 120% for Morozov versus Serbs. Right now, only 60 to 40 that he will win. 60 to 40, yeah, okay. So he actually believes that he is the number one guy in the world? Artyom, do you really think that you are number one at the moment?
Roman (Translator): No. Who do you think is number one? My dad. He said he's dead. He's dead. His father. His father is number one. Okay, just say in arm wrestling, super heavyweight, who is number one? Justin say in arm wrestling. I got it, I got it.
Artyom Morozov: In fact, it's hard to say who is number one, because not everyone fights for East-West. There are people who can't come there for some reason. There are a lot of strong athletes, and I think that everyone is equal, in fact, in terms of strength.
Artyom Morozov: For example, today he is strong, tomorrow another one is strong. There are a lot of such athletes. All at the same time they can be in good shape, one hundred percent. Therefore, it is difficult for me to say who is number one, but there are a lot of athletes in fact.
Roman (Translator): Okay, he said right now there are some armwrestlers throughout the world that unfortunately is not capable of pooling at East versus West so that we cannot know for sure their strength against the athletes that we know currently that are being active. But he said that for sure those athletes are very strong, roughly could be equally same strength, those armwrestlers that are not capable of pooling at East versus West. And he said that
Roman (Translator): So someday, let's say today, maybe one guy from them could be the stronger, then maybe tomorrow the other guy actually manages to beat that guy. So he said that there are several names who he believes that could be potential number one, who are not unfortunately able to pull at least as we speak right now.
Engin Terzi: He could not clearly say the name who is number one. He said that we need to see it. Okay, but does he think that he can beat Gennady, Jerry, Devin and Ermes? Because he said already he's going to beat Gennady. He said already his chance is high, so high again, Jerry. And he said he's going to beat Ermes 60 to 40%.
Engin Terzi: And only Devon left. And he said that he would like really beat him and look at his face and tell me that I'm the greatest. I remember last time when he had the interview. So he clearly believes that with all this mentioned at this, he can beat everyone.
Roman (Translator): Artem said that these armwrestlers, Ermes, Jerry, Devon, Larratt, Gennady. He understood that you said Gennady, you will win. Yes, yes. Do you really think that you will win against all these people? Well, I want to. I want to and I train for it.
Artyom Morozov: But by the time you get, for example,
Artyom Morozov: before the boss before the boss, then it's not a fact that someone will not start breathing into your tail, no one, well, not a fact that someone will already start catching up with you and will be stronger than you understand, that is, I play everyone trains everyone grows here it's hard to say
Roman (Translator): He's saying it's really hard for him to say he wants. He said that I really want to beat all those names that you mentioned, Engin, and that you had spoken about. But right now he cannot just clearly claim and say that I will be victorious against all of them. He said that once I reach the boss and beat that person, then it's up to the people
Engin Terzi: to up to the rest of the arm wrestling world to chase his tail you know so once he knows that he is clearly there and they can the other people can just only uh chase him and not catch yeah yeah yeah i mean i think there's a misunderstanding that when i said i'm talking about here i'm not talking about levon is like for sure i mean it's proven many times the number one in the world i talked about the the mentioned names by the way tell gennady that when he was gone
Engin Terzi: Morozov told behind him that he left because he was so scared of Morozov already. And he said that if he cannot handle now, obviously gonna handle at this stage. Yeah, you tell him, yeah.
Roman (Translator): Gena, Engi said that when you were not with us for about 20 seconds or 1 minute, Morozov said that you were very scared, Morozov, and that's why you were not here. So, Gena, how did you get to Russia? Where did you go?
Roman (Translator): Well, that's why it's important that Morozov is still alive.
Roman (Translator): I started by Russian so that Artyom also understood and at the same time and then I briefly also translated into English. .
Roman (Translator): he said that if the internet connection is the decisive factor against uh these two uh these uh two giants to pull then he's screwed he meant himself then i'm done i'm finished because because of the internet collection so he said that it was
Engin Terzi: But in the reality, at the East versus West stage, when Emil pick up, you know, Gennady Kvikvinia and Artyom Morozov, you know, and then who will be scared? Ask Gennady. I'm just trying to steer the boat, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right. When Emil pick up and Artyom Morozov and Gennady Kvikvinia and Artyom Morozov come out on the scene, it's a very scary scene. That's right. It's a very scary scene.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: he's saying that he's been doing this for 20 years so why would he be scared so he's saying that it's just basically uh another day in the office for him to say because he's been doing this for 20 years already and it's gonna be like uh
Gennadi Kvikvinia: translate he he said that all all these
Roman (Translator): So he said that he's been doing this for 20 years and all these type of like actions that he's doing like screaming and all the stuff it's basically like for show because
Roman (Translator): Other than that, he just feels chilly because it's like another day in the office for him and he said that for Artyom it's better actually to stay still and not say anything, like stay quiet because if his opponent, in this case Artyom, starts to say something then he's gonna really turn up and actually destroy entire building or something like this. So it's better for Artyom... Tell this to Artyom. Artyom, he said that
Roman (Translator): He has been doing armwrestling for more than 20 years and all these shouts, when he shouts and does the opana, all this is part of the show.
Roman (Translator): Because he is like nothing, everything is fine. And he said that it will be more comfortable for you when you say nothing, when you are very deaf, when you don't say anything. Because if you say something against Gennady, he will finish you.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: No, well... Make a scotch like this. Make a scotch like this. Make a scotch like this. Because if you say, all this is enough. And then, in short, here, ten genes together, in short, where do they come from, I don't know. Together, like this, strength. You like it a lot. I add strength.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: They are speaking Russian, I will let them speak. This is before the press conference.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: And he said, it all depends on you, Artem, on how you will
Roman (Translator): If you are as kind as you are now, and we will have a press conference, my heart is like this.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: I will translate Engin everything.
Roman (Translator): so sorry but he's just too fired up okay yeah he said that uh
Roman (Translator): it's better for morozo to stay quiet and what he told to you he started to talk to russian to morozo it's all up to you how you behave yourself during the press conference like pre-match press conference if you because if you say something that i don't like i i will really really uh crush down your like entire entirety what whatever you gonna bring so he said that it's up to you if you if you're gonna
Engin Terzi: be behave well don't say anything that may trigger me i will be good to you but if you say something that triggers me or i dislike i'm gonna punish you punish punish you i'll punish you okay but he has been talking like 20 minutes and then you you translated in like 20 seconds okay what did what what did arton said ask arton is he intimidated by this speech oh gennady
Roman (Translator): He's not scared or intimidated, nothing, no. No, nothing. So he's basically saying that Gennady is spending his energy for nothing, you know.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: Well, your energy is very important, because you don't want to talk about the facts. I don't want to talk about the facts, but I want to talk about my thoughts. I don't want to talk about my thoughts, but I want to talk about my thoughts. I don't want to talk about my thoughts, but I want to talk about my thoughts.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: He said that it's not because Artyom is not intimidated or anything. It's actually because he's looking like kind of tired or kind of weak.
Roman (Translator): something like this because Gennady believes that Artem is not taking the right supplements, you know, and he's going to bring some good supplements because Gennady said that I think Artem is taking some supplements from like Dubai and which is not valid anymore, like the expired dates or something, because he's going to bring some good supplements to lift up his physical shape and also spirit. And then he will turn Morozov into Gennady 2.0.
Roman (Translator): Yeah, because the reason why Morozov is chilling right now is because he's looking very weak, like tired, something like... Did you tell this to Genovii or to Morozov? Artyom, he said in Georgi that you have this view, you have this moment,
Roman (Translator): This is because you take the wrong medication, but he will give it to you when the match is over. And then, after the match and after these medications that Gennady will give you, you will have
Artyom Morozov: more comfortable and you turn yourself into Gennady version 2. I got it. Well, in fact, no matter how much energy he has, I am an energetic vampire. The more energy he has, the more I have, you know?
Gennadi Kvikvinia: He said that no matter how much you eat, you won't be able to do it.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: he said that uh no matter how much energy gennady has
Roman (Translator): he he will take all the energy because artom said that i'm an uh an ergo vampire like he's he's sucking all the energies from his opponents so that make them weak as hell so he said that canadi was out
Roman (Translator): and when he came back he's not that much fired up and with that much energy anymore because he he took some energy he ate some energy from gennady and he he will take all the energy that gennady has then gennady told him back that no matter what you are trying you cannot do anything he said that
Roman (Translator): he told me to tell you, Engin, that actually what the advice that Gennady gave to Artyom, Artyom actually heard it and now he's trying to stay calm and Artyom saying nothing because Gennady told him to not say nothing because that would be better for him. So that's the reason why Borzoi... My question to Artyom. Gennady said it is better for him to be quiet and this and this. Is he gonna be like that or is he gonna be fired up?
Roman (Translator): Artem, he said... At the stage. Yes, yes, yes. He said that, as with Gennady, Gennady gave you lessons, he said that if you don't say anything, it will be more convenient for you.
Roman (Translator): We see that you are not so active and you don't say everything that you want to say or that you can say. Will you be more active when the match is in front of you?
Artyom Morozov: Well, look, let's start with the fact that I don't speak until they give me a word, because education does not allow me to interrupt the elders. If you speak, then I just listen. I want to say, but I can't interrupt. And then this topic kind of closes, and I can't add anything, because it's already gone, you know, I'm late, because I can't interrupt.
Artyom Morozov: Well, I just wanted to say that, Gena, I lead my opponents the same way they lead me. So if you give me the heat, you'll get the heat in return, too, you know?
Gennadi Kvikvinia: So I will say what Morozov said first and then what Gennady answered. Morozov said that...
Roman (Translator): you're not my level he's telling you right now okay just say from the beginning so Morozov started saying that obviously you guys he meant you and again and uh Gennady as as a older and more experienced people a a sportsman uh in this sport he's listening to you guys listening those advices you may gave or those um brief speech that you gave so he's just listening taking it uh and uh
Roman (Translator): considering it obviously but uh as long when he wants to say something about it and answer yeah we are kind of already into the other subject so basically he's on the listening mode right now because you are experienced people and he's just learning and getting everything that he can and other than that he said that um
Roman (Translator): Everybody, he looks his opponents the way he would like to be treated by the opponent. So he said that if they ask me, if they ask like fire from me, I will give the fire. If they are misbehaving, I will teach them the lesson. Basically, that's what he meant. So if more Gennady will be like this, causes some anger from Morozov, then more anger Morozov will give Gennady.
Roman (Translator): So he will deliver what they deserve, what my opponents deserve. And now what does Gennady deserve as far as now? What do you think, Artem, what does Gennady deserve? Because you have already heard what Gennady said. And in your opinion, what will you do with Gennady?
Roman (Translator): Well, Gennady said in the beginning that it will be a war, so we will shoot from both sides, large-caliber. So he said that Gennady, as he already from the beginning mentioned that it's gonna be a war. He said that he will deliver the war and it will be some shooting some big caliber bullets and stuff like this. It will be some war.
Engin Terzi: Okay, let's slowly finish three forces. They're not they couldn't resist Devon's wrist and hook in the first round. How does he think he can handle Morozov's powerful hook? Morozov will be number one soon. Gennady, there is a super chat, super chat. They're asking round one against Devon. Devon's wrist, Devon's hook. He looks stronger. They're asking if you couldn't resist
Roman (Translator): Devon's hook on round one, how are you going to resist Morozov's hook on round one? This is what they think, that they think Morozov is stronger than Devon. So can you translate? Gennady, this is your first super chat. And people think that you are the first one in Devon's match, in the first round. But it's not true.
Roman (Translator): He already said that no matter what people say, it doesn't change the fact. It's not going to change the outcome. Yeah. No matter how much people believe that he cannot take armors. There is another super chat. Silky will get it.
Roman (Translator): He just answered to that guy that most important thing is how match actually went through and finished and he said that it was obvious that he beat and destroyed them. So that's the important. Not what happened like in first round. Okay, SilkyWilkie, thank you for the support. Artyom, will you write in chalk on Gennady's back like round one, round two, round three like you did to
Artyom Morozov: you know corey yes yes i i want choke uh three three rounds can you explain it morozov tell gennady directly what you did to corey and you will do the same tell tell him russian this guy you
Roman (Translator): Gena, you know how it is with Russian people. When you go to the gym, do you go to the gym with your friends? Do you go to the gym with your friends? Do you go to the gym with your friends?
Roman (Translator): I will repeat myself because somebody was calling him and his audio was turned off. I will repeat myself because somebody was calling him and his audio was turned off.
Roman (Translator): Artur, you are already making a mistake by comparing Kory to Gennady. So if you approach this match like you approached Kory's match, then it's already a huge mistake for you. I think, Gennady, there will be three stripes on your face.
Roman (Translator): He said that it would be 3-0 vice versa in favor of Gennady.
Roman (Translator): uh and he said that uh morozo has never competed actually against uh honest versus measurement uh against uh really like tough tough guys when he when he's like one second what does think about this i want to finish what he said and then i will ask that question and he said that when he faced prudnik sound like middle range guy
Roman (Translator): then it was already hard times for Morozov so I mean right now he's gonna face Gennady who is like top level so things will go south for him and now I will I will ask what you just said
Gennadi Kvikvinia: He said that at that time... Okay.
Roman (Translator): He started saying that when Rewaz faced Artyom, his level was like 20%, his actual level, because Rewaz was not really well prepared for Artyom. But after that, if we are talking about comparison, we can see how much
Engin Terzi: Rebas destroyed Dave and how much Morozov struggled against Dave Chaffee as if they were put... One second, one second. Why do we compare... Why do we compare Morozov's August shape and we cannot compare Rebas' December shape? So what makes you think that Morozov didn't improve at all since that time?
Roman (Translator): What do you think about the fact that Morozov was killed in the first place? Morozov was killed in the first place. Morozov was killed in the first place.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: He's saying that the reason is that Morozov is constantly training, like he's training, gaining and exercising, but Rebaz was not prepared for Morozov's match back then. He was not prepared.
Gennadi Kvikvinia: I don't know, I don't know what I'm talking about.
Roman (Translator): okay he said very important thing about rivers right now throughout because they know each other so much well uh how much they train and everything he said that rivers usually never has never entire his like armistead career has never trained for match this long that he's been preparing right now like last eight months he said that he he's been only like preparing for match like maybe one month or a bit more than one month
Roman (Translator): prior to the match, he was preparing for the upcoming match. But right now, Gennady said that right now, Rivas has been preparing, like motivated throughout, like he's doing arm wrestling for a living. Basically, that's what he said. All the businesses that Rivas has... I have a question. Gennady, next month, who is winning? Laletin or Rivas? Rivas. Yeah. And what does Morozov think about it?
Roman (Translator): Artem, do you think Revaz or Vitalik will win? I think Vitalik will win. It will be uncomfortable for Revaz to fight. He said that it will be very uncomfortable for Revaz and he thinks Vitalik will win because how uncomfortable he will be to Revaz.
Roman (Translator): yeah but thank you sorry sorry i would just briefly say uh finish what uh gennady said that brevis will be like his toughest opponent in his uh in gennady's entire amnesty career rivers will be the toughest that he will ever face that's what he said okay okay so a quick quick quick question super shed bernardo thank you hello guys you're opening on hermes's 92 kilo back pressure
Roman (Translator): Artem, did you see the video that Ermes was filming? Yes, I did. What do you think?
Artyom Morozov: Damn, I've seen people who do more side movements. For example, there are a lot of people who do side movements, like wrist movements. But their wrist opens, and the side doesn't work, you know? I mean, it's impossible to do everything behind the table. But I don't deny that Ermes is strong anyway, and this exercise helps him.
Artyom Morozov: But not all these 92 kilograms go to the table. Of course, I understand everything.
Roman (Translator): And obviously I've seen, he saw this video obviously, and he said that I also have seen some other videos where people do like side pressure, like wrist exercises and everything like huge numbers. But he said that all those numbers is definitely not going to be translated to the table when it matters, you know.
Roman (Translator): And he said that I'm not going to take anything away from Ermes' death video, like Ermes' strength. It clearly shows how strong he is and it may help Ermes. But he said that definitely all those 92 kgs that Ermes did in that exercise, definitely not 100% of those kgs will be translated to their table. He said that. Okay. Can you ask the same thing to Gennady? And then we can finish.
Roman (Translator): Okay, Gena, you were talking about the backpressure of the ball. What do you think about the video? Which video? Can you show it? Yes, the video about the backpressure of the ball. No, it's good, but it's not very good. It's not very good, because when you hit the ball,
Roman (Translator): He said that obviously this video this evidently what Ermes did is very impressive. He said that it's really good for Ermes that he managed to pull that off. How many this much kg he obviously has seen the video.
Roman (Translator): and uh he said that uh if if he ever faces morozo he would he would never wish to face actually hermes because that whatever hermes did that exercise it shows how much capable he is then he said that it's really good that hermes did this it's really good for hermes
Roman (Translator): he said that such a workout is very very meaningful and he also said that maybe you do such a workout and you feel very like tired or you feel like as if you tore something in your body and you have to wait relax and like make yourself to have some time to take time off the specific exercise but
Engin Terzi: but once you have done it and then you take some rest time then it kicks in after after some time it kicks in and then you really feel that actually whatever you have done this exercise really pays off okay anyways generally my friend thank you very much for coming uh to the podcast and see you in two weeks in istanbul and i wish you the best stay away from the injuries and same with you morozo

Artyom Morozov: Ah, Gennady also understood what I just said to Artem, so I translated everything he said. Roman, please translate Engin as well. Of course. Well, thank you very much, Engin, for the opportunity to speak, to fight. Of course, sometimes I'm not a good boy.
Artyom Morozov: due to some circumstances that did not allow me to answer, to make a repost, to shoot a video, there are some moments that I do not want to voice. But I still treat you well, I love you, because you are my brother, my Turkish brother, that's how it is. Thank you very much and all the best. See you in Istanbul.
Roman (Translator): Artyom, he said that if you say such kind words, he will fall in love with you.
Roman (Translator): I will translate. So he is very thankful to you, Engin, for giving opportunity to be today with us here and also, obviously, opportunity to pull Gennady. He's very thankful. He said that
Roman (Translator): there are some factors, some things that may prevent him to give like proper answer to those specific details that he may skip because of some language barrier or some other things that he said that I'm not going to mention right now. And he also said that about the video responses, sometimes I maybe kind of take time to answer, respond with the videos to Gennady, but there are some things that kind of
Roman (Translator): makes him not to be active, let's leave it that way, that's what he said. And then Gennady said that he really loves everybody, he's like, you are his brother from Turkey and Gennady's brother from Georgi,
Roman (Translator): he's really really good friends and then admires you both and then kennedy came in and said that if you are going to continue speaking like this he will be falling in love with you i mean what the hell that's what you're gonna do with russian and then okay we'll finish him but there is another super chat yoika uh thank you mankowski uh does gennady think gravis can beat levan in top form if he continues training like this who he thinks will be favorites
