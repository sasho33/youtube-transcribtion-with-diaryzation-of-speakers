Thanks to him for accepting. Oh, 45. Yeah, it was very cold when I went there. My bicep is not completely healed up. This...
SPEAKER_02: This, the inside, there are two heads of the bicep. The inside one, they say, doctor told me it's only 20% is holding. 80% is not holding. It's like gone, you know. Hello, burning tendons. Hello, Dino. Greetings to Croatia. Ah, Reno message is starting to come, but looks like his internet is not so good, or I think he joined here.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. George, I love as well. You know, who is Hutchings pulling now? That is a problem that I need to fix as soon as possible clerks. And is it better to cap or not to cap? For me, I do. I cap, you know, like only it needs to be like someone that, you know, crazy, crazy grip, your hand is tired already. And then when you cap, your fingers are sliding down.
SPEAKER_02: And then so maybe you want to grab him from low from the arm and just force the match to do. Hello, Reno. Hello. Welcome. Hi. Good to see you finally. Good to see you too. I'm just trying to set everything up. Yeah, so it's all good. Yeah. Kadir Ghali versus Devon Hunter, 10 kg. Anything is possible.
SPEAKER_02: Big Dan, it is your kindness, my friend. I think the most important people, there are more than one, but if you say the most, most important, I think it's the one, you know. Hello to India, Anurag. I can't wait to see Reno Massage compete at East versus West. You are doing such great. Thank you. Thank you, Matteo. Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: really excited for east versus west i will always support your events thank you guys thank you uh thank you guys um together we will do crazy things because um i i don't think anyone would question what i feel for the arm wrestling i want to do something crazy at the end of this year really crazy um and then we will see if i can make it or not like really crazy but we will see
SPEAKER_02: So how is everything, Rino? Congratulations once again, winning the Europeans left and right. And you were very dominant. I think the only match that you really had some serious trouble was against Italian friends. Yes, Lamparelli. Lamparelli is a great top roller and it was a very good match. Yes. And I set him against Matt Mask.
SPEAKER_01: That's a really good match. I think I had more trouble against him because I pulled in the wrong lane. He really tried to counter my press and he did that successfully. And I think if I just changed something a bit in the start, I think I would have gone a lot easier. I think the match would have been a lot easier.
SPEAKER_02: So now you have you have you have some experience about it yeah I think that is part of your development that you are putting all kind of different style guys and then now with time, you are.
SPEAKER_02: uh learning more how to pull against different guys you know and i think i think this guy this event east versus west also will add something more to your experience this is only start and hopefully you will have more opportunities and then how old are you now 19 18 i'm still 18. which month which year you born uh 2004.
SPEAKER_02: 2004 so okay then you are you born in second half of the year yes in august at the very end of august 31st of august end of august you will be 19. wow wow yeah it's very good it's very good that you're already doing great things and you're going off
SPEAKER_01: What? You're going to Waffles, Kazakhstan? Yes, yes. Which category, 110 or 100? I was planning on going to 110, but I don't know, it might change, but for now it's 110. And what's your weight now?
SPEAKER_02: 113 14 kilos something like that yeah losing 13 14 kilo in less than two months and competing under kilo i think it's gonna take a lot away from you yeah but this is your choice you know losing 13 14 kilo and you are not really fat yeah a little bit overweight a little bit i saw a little bit no no i'm definitely i'm definitely overweight
SPEAKER_02: But even if I wanted to go in a different class, I was planning on maybe going to the plus category, not lower than 110 kilos. Okay, so nothing like 100. No, no, no. Okay, so you want to do something special, more special by winning the weight category. Yeah, it won't be easy. It won't be easy. There are some guys that are good. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Especially because all of them have like huge hands. That's the most difficult thing. Huge hands. Also, there are like more than one guy that can stop you and tire you. And then the next round, you may be a victim of your draw.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah yeah if you win quick it's good but the tournament is like sometimes it can be very very i'll say like um like firing you know you have one round with the guy two minutes you pull the other guy flashes second round you meet the guy you are now 70 the guy is just 100 yeah absolutely yeah
SPEAKER_02: There is a question for you, Silky Wilkie, thank you. Does Reno get his eyebrows done? Now you are showcasing models on East vs West England. So he thinks that you are a model and you're making your eyebrows down? Yeah, I do get my eyebrows done and thank you for the compliment.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, sorry, so these are eyelashes, this is ironic. Yeah. Anyway, so, Engin, is there going to be any full video footage on King of the Table? My friend, the King of the Table is owned by different people. I don't know when they are going to share, if they are going to share. You know, I have no idea, my friend. I only compete. Hello, big robots.
SPEAKER_02: and okay what time is it one half okay i think i think oh you came already you are on different pages how are you my friend i didn't see you how are you i was just listening what you're saying about me i was just listening oh okay okay yeah so how how have you been terence no i'm i've been good i think training went very well
SPEAKER_02: I didn't get any injuries while training, so I'm very happy. So I'm coming ready. I think it's going to be a good match. Yeah, you coming ready? Yes. Did you watch his match with Lamparelli? I did see it, yes. It was a very good match. Yeah. So what do you think about now? When I say like if it's a good match or not, but did you like have any kind of, you know, conclusions about how to pull against him?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, definitely. I was training to stay out of his very strong press and side pressure and hook because he changed his line very quickly. So I saw with the guy pulled at Amors, what is his name again? I had trouble on the left hand from that transition. He went for top roll and suddenly went to shoulder roll. So I was very struggling on the left hand with that.
SPEAKER_00: So I was training very hard to not let it happen on the right hand with me as well. So, yeah, I did see some videos and some footage. So, yeah, I did train very hard. So I think, yeah, I've trained for that. OK, so you said that you need to get away from his pressure. What's the best way to get away from pressure? You think it's top roll? If it was top roll, then Lamparelli would get away.
SPEAKER_00: Or do you think the best way is different than what Lamparelli did? Yeah, I think Lamparelli was a little bit too slow. He was already, Reiner was already behind his arm. So I think that gave Lamparelli a lot of trouble. So, yeah, I think if you can get him out of his shoulder line, you have a better chance. But he's so fast. So it's going to be difficult. Yeah. But what is that? Like getting this or...
SPEAKER_00: this i think if you're gonna go for for verse you'll end up this in this position but if you're gonna go for this you'll end up in that position you don't want to be so i think um you have to be very clever to pull against him but also um he's not only press and only side pressure he can hook he can top roll he can do anything so luckily for me i'm also versatile so i think i think it's going to be a good match
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I was, I was, I was like, you pulled a guy, Mindaugas, what was his name? Yes, Mindaugas Tuzkas. Yeah, yeah. I saw that, like, you, I thought that you could be having some trouble with your elbow because he was also putting that kind of pressure. And then you are like, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Let's go inside, you know, and then I was kind of, I was kind of surprised to see that your insight is like also ready, ready. So yeah, it's interesting. I just can't wait. You know, I see that one of you, you used to be at Reno's place. Exactly. And then now after a long time, you're making a comeback and now someone is just a new emergent start.
SPEAKER_02: And now you guys are going to pull. I just can't wait. You know, I just can't wait. I think you are more experienced than him, but he also has a really good horsepower. We will see, you know, how, how it will be. How do you see that match Reno? How do you see your chances? You're going to, you're going to approach the match like, like a gentleman, this and that, or you're going to approach the match. Listen, this has been my dream. Sorry, but I have to destroy you or something, you know? Uh,
SPEAKER_01: I think it will be something in between. I think the match will definitely be very interesting. I can't wait also. And I think that Terence is definitely a fierce opponent and he's not to be taken lightly. And I will have to really, really be focused and train hard for the match. So I still do think that I am the favorite.
SPEAKER_02: But I think that it will definitely be a good match. Yeah, I think you need to see yourself as a favorite. If you are going into the match, you should never see yourself like, oh, I'm going to lose or something. But the way that you are saying that you are favorite, is it from your own perspective or even with the objective eyes? I think it's from my own perspective.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, and you, Terence? Yeah, I think, Reiner, how old are you now? You're 18 years old, right? Yes. Wow. So I've been pulling longer when you are old. Yeah. What is your birth month? 2004, August 31st. Okay, 2004. Okay, I only started in 2005, March.
SPEAKER_00: So you are six months older than I started to arm wrestle. So definitely, I think the experience is on my side. Yeah, I agree. Once I was you in the past, I started arm wrestling when I was 20 years old. And yeah, I beat some good names. I beat some
SPEAKER_00: In the World Championships, after the competition, they said, who the hell, what the hell is this guy on the Northeast Pro Boards? I don't know if Ingen can remember that. But yeah, I used to be you. So I see a lot of you in myself. I used to also be an upcoming star and
SPEAKER_00: Because I stay so far from the world, I think you're much more privileged than me to be close to the competitions. But for me, it's very far to travel and very expensive. So at one stage of my life, my job didn't allow me to travel anymore. But at least now it's getting better. I can get the chance of traveling again. So, yeah, I wasn't out of armwrestling. I was still competing in South Africa, but nobody saw because it's only in South Africa.
SPEAKER_00: But we have some good athletes here as well. So yeah, I think in my eyes, I stand a very good chance of beating you.
SPEAKER_02: um i've also the guys i train with also feel confident so yeah we'll see it's difficult it's good it's good i like that i like that everything you say is right but the way to you're right he lives in right in europe europe is the where the yes like anyone who is competing twice a year european award championships is just having the the best experience in the world no definitely but what you can do terence i think you can
SPEAKER_02: just try to make the sport more developed where you are and then just involve more people and make your own top competition but do you guys do you feel like terence you said you are far away do you also feel like you know is like this event as an opportunity for yourself no yes definitely i'm
SPEAKER_00: I'm very pleased and I'm so thankful for being invited because if I can, obviously both of us is making our debut in this East versus West. So both of us wants to win because as soon as you win, everybody wants to see you to pull against the next guy. If you lose, your chances of pulling a next better opponent is very scarce.
SPEAKER_02: I think for me and Reino both, it's a very big opportunity. So definitely East vs West is the platform everybody wants to compete at. I want to cut to you. When you say you are thankful, but just remember everyone who is invited deserves to be here. 100%. No one is giving them anything. It's only what they deserve. And yes, that is something that if you lose,
SPEAKER_00: you may have to go through qualification, while when you win, everyone is going to say, hey, we want to see him again. This guy, this guy, that guy, that guy, you know? Yeah. Definitely, that's the mindset I'm coming to the competition. I need to win this match. I'm feeling bad for Rainer. You have to pull against me because he has the same mindset. He also needs to win to continue.
SPEAKER_00: But yeah, he has a good, solid name. Everybody is the crowd favourite, definitely. And yeah, I think it's going to be a good match. I just hope it's a good match. So you are not coming there with any doubt in your mind that, you know, I'm going to win this. I'm making a comeback and I'm going to win, huh, Terence? Yeah, definitely. You can see the matches, what I've pulled in the past.
SPEAKER_00: I was at Amors, I pulled some very strong opponents there. I saw Reino training with the same guy. I think I did a better performance than that guy. Nothing to take away from him. Styles make matches. And obviously, nine months later, you can't really compare it. But for your own confidence, with the matches I saw, I think I have a very good chance. Was it after the pull or was it training or it was competition?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, what I saw was after pull, so you can't really read too much into that. But I think Cendres that pulled Dulskas, and also I pulled Dulskas. So I think I feel very confident after that match. Yeah. Another question. Where are you now compared to your prime? Or is this your prime? This is a difficult question. It's difficult to answer.
SPEAKER_00: If I see the weights, what I'm using to train with, I'm definitely stronger than I was. Obviously, I don't use any... You are more experienced now. So you are physically stronger and more experienced and hungry because you have been far from the competition. So I think that this is the most dangerous Terence we have ever seen. Yes, I think so. Obviously, I'm not scared to say that I didn't use any supplements. So I'm clean.
SPEAKER_00: I will always remain clean. You know me and you had a chat before. But luckily for somebody that is not using any supplements, he has a better chance of keeping his stamina during the match. I think it's going to be very good. I know it's also clean, so I think that is a fair match. The best guy of the day is going to win.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. And okay, how do we pronounce your name? Reno or Rhino? Reno. Reno, yeah. Okay. I started to say Reno. Reno, there is a super chat for you. Reno, you are a Croatian. Silky Wilkie is asking, one of my favorite footballers growing up was Luka Modric. Did you ever see him play? I saw him play, but I never saw him in person. Oh, you never. So you are not really a football fan or?
SPEAKER_01: no i am a football fan but uh i only like uh follow football and i watch it only when the world cup is on and uh some champions not not not really uh consistently watching football
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, I mean, come on. We are the superstars, right? Yeah. Yeah, this is their world, this is our world. Our superstars are right there, Reno and Terence. Yeah, maybe, hopefully, someday they will come and ask you for a signature, you know? Oh, that would be an honor if that would happen.
SPEAKER_02: anyway so what do you think about all those things that terence has been saying looks like he's very confident i i kind of felt like he's more confident than i was expecting him to be and and then he has some like examples to compare you know yeah yeah himself like do those mean anything uh
SPEAKER_01: Well, I believe that it means to him a lot, and I'm very glad to see him back in the sport and that he has more opportunity to travel now. And I think that all of the examples that he gave are, of course, good and, again, mean a lot to him. But for myself, I only focus on that one match. I don't really look at other performances. I only compare my performance to myself before a few months ago or a week ago or something like that.
SPEAKER_01: So, uh, right now I can't, um, really train that much, or I can't really improve that much as I have a competition in like a week. Um, maybe in two weeks, uh, it's Zagreb strong and I'm only going to be competing on the left hand. Uh, because after a week, a week after Zagreb strong, I'm going to, of course, uh, Istanbul to fight parents. And, um, I think that, uh,
SPEAKER_01: I don't have that much time to improve, so I'm just going to try to keep my form and not do anything crazy because the day I came back from Moldova, I arm wrestled with my mentor, Andrea Simic, and we completely destroyed our arms and my tendons got really sore and I really couldn't do anything. Yeah, so I needed to rest for a while. So I'm going to try to keep my form and I'll be happy.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, many people are saying, how many days to rest? How many days to do this? I think we should all have a dynamic mind. You need to listen to your body and learn about your body and then just give it what it needs. There is nothing like the standard, do seven days, do five days, do three days. If it's okay in five days, do five days. If it is not, do seven days.
SPEAKER_02: But everything is different for everyone. Yes, yes, you need to know the best answer for your own self, you know. And about the after planes, and we saw you,
SPEAKER_02: then people kind of like uh question you uh you put in 85 kilo left arm georgian guy and people were like wow wow wow and then we saw that the guy on senior day i don't think he was in the even final he was probably fourth place or something well something like that something like that yeah he didn't even win his class while you uh kind of comfortably won yours
SPEAKER_01: and and yeah so just a message to Terence about the after pool Terence playing mind games like trying anything and i was just trying to grip up with him to see how uh he feels on the setup i rely a lot on the start and that's exactly why in most after pools i lose to everyone so and that's not really your pulling style you know what you're
SPEAKER_02: trying to do you know you're more like i don't know you go with left arm the same way pressure yeah i can do all of the techniques on both of my arms i saw you in last year's europeans you hook krasimir and you travel him at the europeans and then you top roll him in strap i saw yeah yeah yeah it's it's incredible yeah and i i just i'm i'm just happy that you know uh
SPEAKER_02: like all i want is like the i want to see the the passion in the eyes of the athletes they if they have the goals i mean it just like motivates me like okay i mean this is your duty you need to serve them you need to do everything for them but whenever i see that people are like oh yeah it's okay if i do or not or something that that that i it doesn't excite me
SPEAKER_02: i really need people with passion that you know have something to prove you know like themselves um i i remember when i won the first world title i said i want to do the next one in the second different weight class the third fourth and i won the worst fifth my dream was seventh but injuries never allowed me and so you always need to challenge yourself to do something more than what you have done
SPEAKER_02: Absolutely. We always want to do better. Always want to do better. Yeah, yeah. The same, you know, when I do the East versus West, I'm like, okay, it shouldn't be a repetition or the last one. It needs to be something different on this one. We need to do more, more. Yeah, that is how we progress, you know. And yeah, it will be great, great place. Without that kind of mindset, you really can't go far. You always want to, you always have to be looking forward to something bigger, better.
SPEAKER_02: and you always need to want to improve yeah yeah yeah like last next year i may pull off because next year i will be 50. i won i won my world title first at 19 and then i won in 20s and i won in my 30s and i will i only say you're in 40s next year if i win gold or even medal then i will be winning
SPEAKER_02: medals in when i'm 90s and 20s 30s 40s 50s i'm not talking about masters if i go through masters i will probably get in something you know till i'm 70 but i'm talking about real warships yeah yeah there are some other great matches too i would like to also ask you guys what you guys think about and
SPEAKER_02: Let's see what we have. Did you guys see the belt? Yeah, the belt looks awesome. I love it. I love the design. I have a question for you guys. What is the goal? The only goal is beating each other or there is some goal that is far beyond, you know,
SPEAKER_00: winning on July 29th. Do you want to have that belt? No, definitely. Well, I think if you can pull for the world title match, I think that is the ultimate goal. And to defend it again, that's also one of the goals as well. I mean, listen, if you're not competing,
SPEAKER_02: There should be no one in your weight that can beat you. It should bother you. Like somebody is better than me. That's true. There is someone who is breathing and better than me in my category. That is disturbing feeling you.
SPEAKER_02: That is probably why I will never compete for fun. You know, I need to now I'm returning. So my goal, I know that I cannot win 95 kilos. I have never been really 95 kilos because I competed officially 75. So maybe 85 kilos. I will try. So let's go to other matches. I want to hear the predictions. Jerry Cadoret versus Hermes Gasparini. I think...
SPEAKER_01: In my opinion, I think that Hermes has a better chance of winning against Jerry. Jerry might be able to get one or maximum two pins on Hermes, but I think that Hermes has a good transition from a top role to a press. And as long as he keeps that center to his side or in the center, I think Jerry really can't get access to his power. And I even think that
SPEAKER_01: Hermes can flash spin Jerry by trying to press him. And I think his press is pretty good. And if he gets the angle right, he could go through his flop wrist press. And someone who can do flop wrist press, you favor the top roller, right? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to say now, because I favor Jerry in this match, but it's the same spot as Reno is pulling. Okay, so now Reno just described, you know, how Uterus has possibly defeated him, right? Yeah, I might just recap that one. My favorite definitely in that match, I think, is Jerry. I think once he gets behind his arm in a strap, I don't think...
SPEAKER_00: I think he's going to tire out Armes' pronator too much. I don't think he's going to go through there. I saw he's lifting very heavy weights. I think only 10 kilos heavier than Reino is lifting. I saw you call it the world record on the back pressure. Yeah, 92 kilos. Yeah, so I think his pronator is very strong and very trained. But I think after three, four matches,
SPEAKER_00: in a flop rest, and you're not going to be able to use your pronator so much. Okay, I'm going to do. If he manages to finish the matches quickly, he won't have any issues with Jerry. Yeah, if it's flash pins, but if a match stops, I think it's going to be difficult. Yeah. Okay. Reno, why do you think that Terence is still calling you Rhino instead of Reno?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I don't really notice it. It doesn't bother me at all if people call me Rhino or however they want, really. However they pronounce my name, it's fine. I'm just trying to start shit, you know. I think we are too calm or too respectful to even have any kind of trash talk between us.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah but let me still try you know let me still try yeah yeah because you live in south africa and rhino you meant like that one yes yes a lot of rhinos yeah rhinos yeah right yeah he took me he took me to uh kruger national park right that's correct yeah i was like like it is just like a like
SPEAKER_02: wild you know like place you know there are some doors and outside is with the electric cables right yes and then there are some places for like vacation the hotel and everything and you go with your own car inside and then you go in and the lions are there and then yeah i was like like i was thinking because whenever i was like i thought that when lion sees us he just jumps on us
SPEAKER_02: They don't give a shit, you know. Which year was it, Terence, I came and visited you? 2014, maybe? Yeah, I think it was 14, yeah. Wow, almost 10 years ago. Wow. Yeah. You know why I call him Rhino? It's because he's big and slow. Oh!
SPEAKER_01: That's why. It's starting. Yeah, he's trying to provocate you. And what are you Terrence? Lion? Can lion kill Reno? No, definitely. Yeah, definitely. No, lion, elephants, lions, elephants,
SPEAKER_00: Rhinos is very dangerous. Buffaloes. So we were driving in a Kruger National Park, me and you, but we didn't get out of the car. As soon as you see trouble, you need to go. But yeah, it's a very interesting place. I remember we saw a leopard as well. I know it's a very scarce thing you can see in Kruger National Park, but we saw one. Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think Engin left. I think so. Yeah. He's tired of us. Yeah. It said you're the host now. Yeah, he left. Oh, wow. I think he will join us back now. I don't think he can. Oh, he's back. Yeah, I'm back.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I just wanted to leave for a second and then listen to you guys what you talk behind me and then I'm like, okay. I was on my way to tell Reno how he was sleeping in the car in the Kruger National Park, but I will not do that. Okay, do you follow the poll results? 77% Reno is going to win and Terence has like
SPEAKER_00: Now 22% Terence, 78% Reno. Does it affect your psychology, Terence, to see this kind of result? No, I think that result will be there because of Rhino is more famous currently. Because when I was armwrestling, the new guys, what is watching armwrestling now, is not around. They are around, but it's too much new guys. So everybody knows Reno.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think they know me or know what I've done in the past. So, yeah, I think after the East versus West, people will know who I am. Even if I win or I lose, they will know who I am and they will go look in the history and see the matches I've done in the past. Okay, let's go back to Jerry versus Hermes. I just started the poll. Yesterday, it was like 62% Hermes and 38%.
SPEAKER_02: What's your opinion about that match, Terence? I think Jerry is going to win that one.
SPEAKER_02: hermes is gonna destroy him i don't know if it is because hermes is young and more like charismatic while jerry gives his wrist maybe maybe they like top roller better than the flop wrist or is this because hermes is i mean hermes really proved himself you know hermes really like what he did to levan of course levan won but he was just very impressive like it was like i was at a point like
SPEAKER_02: like is this real you know like the like time stop you know i was like what's happening leon is like this and hermes is just like going like this i was like wow we learned something new before the match if you say if leon takes hermes's risk do you think there is a possibility to go like this we would just say probably leon would break his arm right but we learned something new you know yeah now it's hard to yeah hard to really um predict these matches
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah anything we're still learning you know we know something as much as it's proven but i mean like another thing that i was amazed even more amazed
SPEAKER_02: how Ongarbe pulled against Michael Todd, you know, like he was also something like, I just can't imagine anything. The guy has speed, the guy has endurance, well-rounded, he's smart, he knows when to wait, he knows when to attack. Like, wow, it was just like incredible. Anyway, so you are saying that, but do you think that Jerry is underestimated? Definitely. What I told Marina just now,
SPEAKER_00: I said, I think Armas is prone to get tired. If the match stops and there's a strap, I think he's prone to be too tired to beat Jerry six times if he's on the wrong side of the table. Three times you need. Oh, three times, okay. Best of five. Listen, don't tell me that coming around you need to win at the East versus West while I set you a match. Okay, one second. Rino, who do you want to replace in the match?
SPEAKER_02: Do you really believe that Hermes is going to go this way? No, I think he's going to go for the top role. He's very good at that. I know he can do multiple styles.
SPEAKER_02: top roller, even when they see you training in the gym, he's lifting 92 kilograms to the back. So I think he's definitely going to use his Peronator a lot. I think that lifting 92 kilos, I think that we should lift the weights in the angle that we are also going to go apply
SPEAKER_02: pressure to the pad but when you are lifting like when you are like this i am not sure if it is uh it is so good uh idea to lose all the angles you know because you may apply so much pressure but if you cannot have i think you need to have this the elbow lock to apply the the pressure
SPEAKER_02: But I think that Hermes, I see that Hermes knows what he needs to do. But knowing what he needs, first you need to know what you need to do. The second, you need to be capable of doing that. It also requires strength and ability. We will see if he can or not, but just I know one thing for sure that Jerry has pulled many guys like Hermes.
SPEAKER_02: But I'm not sure how many opponents Ermes had like Jerry. It doesn't mean that Ermes cannot win because Ermes is incredible. Once he takes you here, once he puts his shoulder, he cannot do maybe direct shoulder pressure. But once he gets on his position, I haven't seen anyone stopping him yet. Yes, that is very good. Yeah. Let's see another one. So I'm going to ask you.
SPEAKER_02: Gennady versus Morozov. That match, whenever I take, it just hurts my elbow. I'm just thinking, ready, go. Boom. And then if they messed up, can you imagine the pressure there? Immense, immense, unimaginable pressure. Yeah. And then they both have incredible endurance. Morozov many times came back from, you know,
SPEAKER_02: Two losses. Yeah, and then losing positions. While we saw the Gennady, before the Gennady versus Devon match, I always reminded Gennady, like, okay, what do you think about Devon's endurance? And he was like, how about my endurance, you know? And the guy also has good endurance. So, Reno, let's go with you. I don't know. In my opinion, Morozov is the favorite in this match.
SPEAKER_01: I know that Gennady is really strong, but as we saw in his match with Hermes, his wrist could be his weakness. But again, with the match with Devon, we saw that he can do an excellent flop wrist press. So I think that Morozov definitely has a challenge in front of him, but he is super versatile and we saw
SPEAKER_02: his match with uh corey that he can switch styles in the middle of the match and he can tell when to switch pressure and to switch it into the correct position so i think that one of us will win this match i have a question reno um in 2018 i think yet gennady got injured 2018 and the match that he had against uh aramis was as far as i remember endo
SPEAKER_02: 2021. yeah so it was like almost three years he was away from competition and that was the first match and he still was afraid to use his joint if you realize that only thing he did was pulling himself back against hermes but maybe you realize that fifth round six round he kind of get a little bit more brave and started
SPEAKER_02: You know, Hayden, I don't know if you remember the match. I'm not saying that maybe Hermes didn't take so seriously the last round, but what I'm just saying that Gennady and the Gennady of today. Yeah, two different people. Not only about the strength, also psychologically you are awake and you are healthy now. And so.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I understand what you are saying, but the guy also has, I mean, he's capable of doing many things at the table. So you are saying Morozov is the favorite? Yeah. But by top roller or even in the hook? I think even in the hook, he has a great chance of beating Gennady. So you are saying that even in the hook, his chance is higher than Gennady's chance? Yeah, I would say so, yes.
SPEAKER_01: Like to win three rounds or just fresh match? I think that maybe he would get tired if they went into a hook in every single round and maybe he wouldn't have as good a chance. So, yeah, I would say in the first match, if they were fresh and they both went into a hook, I think that Morozov would have a better chance of beating Gennady. But you believe that Morozov is...
SPEAKER_02: gonna win generally but you depend on his top role by saying this I don't think he uh he I he depends on his top role I think he can pull in every position almost equally as well okay how is he gonna win just just tell me like how do you think he's gonna win just top roll probably top roll and hook
SPEAKER_00: Oh, so whatever position he is in, he is going to win. That's what you're saying. And Terence? I'm so glad Reno said Morozov is going to win because I don't want to agree with Reno. My favourite is definitely Gennady. I've known him a very long time.
SPEAKER_00: Even in 2009, he was on the stage there in Italy making a show for the crowd at the World Championships. I don't know who plays with your opponent in the final and gives a show. So, I respect for Manon very well. Terence, one second. So, what I see that...
SPEAKER_00: The new generation is supporting the new generation, the old generation is supporting the old generation. Yes, definitely. And Reno is voting for Morozov, so there's no way I can agree with him. So I have to choose somebody else. But luckily for me, it's my favourite one, so it's good. So you are saying that the old school guys are going to give some lessons to the new school guys? Definitely, yeah. We're definitely going to have a meeting before the time.
SPEAKER_02: see how we're going to beat these young guys yeah see paul brick says that terence put this guy to the bed it means that the guy is so young put him to the bed and tell him like some story put me to sleep 72 percent morozo 28 percent genari
SPEAKER_00: So this is the 71-29 now. Okay, let's go to the next one. Farid Ousmanli and Wagner Bartolotto. Bartolotto, yes. Is it left arm? I think so, yes. It's left arm, yeah. Reno can answer first. I want to hear what he says.
SPEAKER_02: I think they are both old school guys. That's a really good match. If I remember correctly, Farid had a match with Corey on the left hand as well. I can't remember did he lose or win. He lost 3-2, while Wagner lost to Deserano 3-2. Both left hand matches. It also was Deserano's comeback match.
SPEAKER_01: after probably maybe one and a half year, probably. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that Bortolato has a good chance at beating Farid, even though Farid is very, very strong inside and outside. I'm not really so... I don't really know Farid's strengths so well, but I do know that Bortolato likes to go for a press
SPEAKER_01: and is more inside focused. So if Farid doesn't contest the center of Bortolato and if he doesn't keep his shoulders behind his arm at all times, I think that Bortolato will just press through his arm if he
SPEAKER_01: If Farid does something like this, I think he will just lose immediately. So you are saying that Farid needs to take Bortolato's hands past his shoulder, so he can identify the shoulder pressure. Yeah. Here, even if Bortolato manages to press, Farid is here.
SPEAKER_02: he's pressing into his whole arm not only on his brachioradialis yeah so basically basically to apply shoulder pressure you need to put shoulder behind your head if your hand is taken that way it's hard to press or if your hand turned this way and if you don't have the wrist it's also hard because here your tricep is working this way once your palm is facing up now your tricep is working to do your illusions
SPEAKER_00: You're trying to give Terence a hand. Yes, yes, yes, yes. I don't know how to do these things privately, so I do it in front of everyone. Thanks for the videos you sent me, Ingen. I appreciate it. I saw it yesterday. The videos I sent you? Yeah, how to beat Reno, I remember. You sent it to me yesterday, remember?
SPEAKER_02: I will tell you something, Terence. You and Reno understand that there are countless people
SPEAKER_02: the behind the keyboard that they really take that very seriously i said jerry is it fair that this guy is so light for you you know is it fair you are heavier and then some guy just like very seriously this is favoritism you know like you see that you are supporting this guy and then i was like like we all laugh you know this is just funny and the guy like really takes seriously so
SPEAKER_02: yeah because i i asked you whenever your job just mentioned is a job so that i won't have to take all that you know yeah yeah yeah it was definitely a joke i was just kidding okay so what were we talking about hugo now terence he said that wagner is most likely gonna win it's 55 45 for wagner so far
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think Ferret is going to win this one, definitely. I didn't see him compete the last few years. I didn't see any of his matches. I don't know on what level he is. But I also think Wagner is also not on that very high level he used to be. I competed against Wagner in 2013 at the number of World Cup.
SPEAKER_00: So it was a good match. It was a long match. Talking about left or right? Left hand. Oh, yeah? Wow. Yes. And so in my head at that stage, I don't see myself ever standing a chance of beating Farid.
SPEAKER_00: at all he was on a higher level in my head he was on a higher level than i was but i could have um i was in the same level as wagner was so i think in my favorite will be very i think he will beat him i don't know about his styles because i didn't see him compete for a few years so i'm not sure i'm not sure how the match is gonna go but i think he's a stronger guy okay let's go to pablo versus
SPEAKER_01: a good match as well i think that uh for me the favorite is sandris uh just because of his versatility and his ability to counter uh pablo's hook i didn't see pablo i saw pablo pull top roll on the left hand but for me it looked a little bit you know unpolished and maybe like
SPEAKER_01: He's just beginning to try top roll and he's beginning to catch on how to use top roll. And I think that Sandris is definitely the favorite in this match. And I think that he will be able to isolate Pablo's bicep and beat him pretty comfortably.
SPEAKER_02: Um, um, Sandra is, is one of those guys that is undefeated at East versus West. He'd be chance show. And then he'd be locked on and the math mask. And now he is pulling Paulo. I think in a fresh match, the horsepower, pure horsepower, uh, Paulo can be very dangerous, but can he do that like three times?
SPEAKER_01: Paolo doesn't seem super good with the endurance. If you can dominate someone, then you can do three times. Once you are stopped, and then... He doesn't even need to get stopped. If you watched the video, if you watched his match with Sabin Batulescu, he actually, if I remember correctly, he flash-spinned him two times. Yeah. And then one time, I think...
SPEAKER_02: Maybe Badulescu got a little stop and then it was over. Yeah, but I think the first two rounds Badulescu went this way and the other rounds I think he more went to the arm. He applied side pressure a lot sooner in the first two rounds. And how do you see that Terence, that match? Yeah, I also think Sanders is going to take this one. I understand.
SPEAKER_02: anyway so you both think sandris is gonna win and then let's go to the next one daniel prokopchuk emil amirshadian are you guys familiar with emil no no sadly i'm not you guys don't know i mean emil and daniel has some history and as far as i remember daniel beat him
SPEAKER_02: 2017 World Final and then 2018, I think the Europeans, Emil won. I don't think Daniel was in top three.
SPEAKER_02: And I think second place was Mindaugas, third was Cerkasov. And then 2008 in Moldova event, either Emil didn't compete or Emil competed but didn't do well, because I remember Daniel and Cerkasov at the final. And then 2019, before the pandemic, and they were in same class, 70 kilo, and Emil won.
SPEAKER_02: not sure what Daniel plays but maybe third maybe I don't remember so Emil is no joke Emil has won category that Daniel was part and Daniel also did the same thing against him um so I think it's gonna be a good match and so you guys don't know Emil so probably hard for you to predict no very hard I don't know these guys
SPEAKER_01: I think that anyone in the 75 kilo class going against Daniel is going to be kind of the underdog or not the favorite. How about Alain Zolaev? Alain Zolaev. 75 kilo. Yeah, could be a tough man. He would also be underdog, you think? I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: In my mind, yes, because I don't know too much. You mean left or right? You mean left or right? Right. I think right hand. Right arm? Oh, okay. Because Daniel has not won any right arm or title yet. He won left arm, all his titles. Oh, really? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah. And this year, most likely Alan will go to Kazakhstan to see Daniel versus Alan will be like mind blowing. I invite Alan Zola, but he is in the army, army university, army academy or something. And he cannot travel outside of Russia unless it is like an official event or something. Something like what it is. Yeah, I'm still trying.
SPEAKER_01: I'm still trying because... They're both like slow pullers. They like to get into their position and slowly pull. And I think that would be definitely interesting. Forever match. Forever match, yeah. It will never end. Who has more endurance and who can position better and pull at a better angle, I think that's what's going to really show in that match. Yeah. And then we have Lachlan versus...
SPEAKER_01: mike aiello oh my god i know who mike ayala oh yeah yeah yeah okay yeah um i don't know mike mike uh looks really strong in most of his matches i don't know he doesn't seem super versatile at least to me it looks like he only pulls in inside uh lachland uh pretty good
SPEAKER_01: top role and hook uh i think he is going to have a pretty tough match with mike mike is no joke um i don't know really tough tough to predict who's going to win this one as i'm not really familiar with their strength they pull in the past and mike
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, kind of comfortably as far as I remember. And Lachlan was happy that he has a chance to pull. I never knew that they pulled before, you know. I would definitely put Mike as the favorite, especially after this event in Australia that was held like yesterday or a few days ago. I saw that Lachlan had a bit of trouble with one of the guys that he was pulling against.
SPEAKER_00: And I don't know. It just seems to me like he's staying in one place, you know, not really going up in power or anything like that. Soon we will find out how their current shape is. And what do you think, Terence? Do you know the guys? Yeah, I know Lachlan very well. He's also from the southern hemisphere. He's from Australia. He's my neighbour. So he's a good guy.
SPEAKER_00: But I think he's struggling with an injury. I don't know. I'll have to speak to him again. But last time he was recovering from an injury. I think that is why his rest is exposed. But if he's healed up, I think he has a very good chance of giving a good match. But I'm slightly going to go with Mike as the favourite. I understand. And let's go. Chancho versus Petrenko.
SPEAKER_02: Is it the right arm? Right arm, yeah, yeah. I wouldn't say the match for Chance left arm. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Again, a tough one to predict. Last match that Chance had was against the Georgian. Arabuli, yeah. Arabuli, he toppled Arabuli. He even flashed me. And then he pressed, floor pressed.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I would never think that someone would flop wrist him. But yeah, Petrenko, I don't know. We will see. Petrenko is also a very strong guy. Yeah, he goes mostly inside, as I saw. With his left, he can go top roll and inside. But with his right, I think his right hand is weaker than his left hand. He goes mostly inside. So if he can get into the strap with...
SPEAKER_01: chance and if he can set a hook i think chance will have uh some trouble definitely but if chance can get him uh on the start if he can take his wrist i think he won't have any problems with him so you are you told all the possibilities but what do you think is gonna win i don't know it's so difficult to to predict who's going to win 50 50.
SPEAKER_01: something like that yeah it's going to depend a lot on the start and a lot on who has a better position and who's ready i don't know i i i would put my money on chance chance okay so you are saying 51 49 probably yeah yeah fortunately and and terence
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm also with Johns on this one. I think he's very explosive and I think he has a very good start. So I think that will be devastating for a hooker against him. And also, I know he can hook, but I think his top role is going to go over him. You're talking about Johns? Yeah, I think Petrenko can also go outside as well, but we will see.
SPEAKER_01: i don't know him but well i don't know him but well yeah but petrenko is definitely a lot slower like terence said he's a chance is much more explosive than than petrenko and we definitely saw that in his match with uh john uh he was just so slow on the start and talking about john no i'm talking about uh uh petrenko that he's really slow on the start oh okay okay okay i understand yeah
SPEAKER_02: understand yeah i mean chance is explosive if he can also have the wrist but sometimes like if the guy's opponent is like i mean the grenade resource like any of your rest this is going that way i kind of think that it's going to be a very good match you know right from the beginning but i don't expect i expect a flash pin by chance only if patrenko tries to go inside
SPEAKER_02: If Petrenko protects his back pressure, it may be a battle with the both have neutral wrists and then pull such way. It's definitely going to be a tough, tough match for both of them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then let's go to quickly Justin Bishop versus Tom's Tom's roses. Oh my God. I'm not familiar with it.
SPEAKER_02: Then I ask you another one. Oh, this one, this one, I don't know. But I ask you only, just say your prediction, no detail, okay, for this one. Just say who's going to win, okay? Okay. Rino Matic versus Terence Opperman. I think Rino will win. Rino is going to win. And Terence? I think the guy from Southern Hemisphere is definitely the favourite, yeah. Definitely the favourite? Yeah. In my eyes.
SPEAKER_02: 3-0? 3-0? Definitely. I think that last round, he might play a little bit with his foot, but we'll see. Okay, okay. Anyway, so there is also Elisabeth versus Carolina. Elisabeth, we get to know her. I mean, at least I, after the East versus West finals, she looks very strong. And Carolina, I don't know if you guys
SPEAKER_02: know her or not but carolina probably has pulled uh some of the longest arm wrestling matches in the history once she stops you she will pull like three days and three nights you know just yeah yeah and carolina is incredibly experienced elizabeth is kind of new compared to her elizabeth is a little bit heavier
SPEAKER_02: I think she will be like five kilos or something heavier. And she looks very strong. She looks very strong, but I really don't know how the match is gonna go. One is super powerful while other one is like experienced and have incredible endurance. And you know, women usually they don't use the wrists so much like we do. They go like,
SPEAKER_02: more like this and then more like nobody nobody controls each other's pronator or something and then they actually put pressure like on unlocked elbow you know you don't like once you control it's easy to people when you don't just apply your own pressure without making the opponents you know those locking points you know like i only saw i only saw barbara do that
SPEAKER_02: a high high risk and control if it is in like like i mean sarah beckman also that's what i also wanted to say now yeah irina makewa and heidi anderson oh yeah they were just incredible yeah anyways we will see levan saginash with liver reno will crush terence he is a champion in past but the new age has come
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, this, this is exactly, this is exactly who said this. This is something that Petrenko said about John, like the new age has come and then, and then in East versus West is the approval of that. He couldn't do it, but later, later, later Iraq has done it. Yeah. We will see. What do you guys think about if the match, uh, rematch happens between on Garbo and John?
SPEAKER_01: I still think that Ongar Baev will win. Especially now, I'm even more convinced that he's even better than I thought previously. I think that John is just too slow. And I think that age is sadly getting the better of him. And he's slowly slowing down even more. And I think he just couldn't keep up with...
SPEAKER_02: Onger Baye's speed and constant surges. So I think that Onger Baye would win that match. Yeah, when we get older, the signal from brain to the hand is just coming slower. Before, when I was young, I was feeling like my brain is in my hand. I could close my eyes and then feel everything right here. Now, I need to like, please send signal to my hand. Please send signal to my hand.
SPEAKER_02: yeah just and and then imagine that the all the pressure john has experienced just imagine he had like cleve dean richard lapkus gary goodrich alankare pushkar ferry
SPEAKER_02: Devon Travis Dennis you know like it's still up to today you know it can you imagine that how much pressure that arm felt you know in the last 40 years wow I mean I'm surprised that you can still compete you know because the guy it's a miracle it's a miracle that someone at his age can still be so prominent even with the young and up-and-coming arm wrestlers it's just
SPEAKER_02: phenomenal and incredible that we have someone like him in our sport it's incredible yes yes like 40 years and then even today someone who is as heavy as him cannot say that i would destroy this guy because anything can happen you know
SPEAKER_02: like i wouldn't i wouldn't be surprised he comes in a shape and beats on the web even though i see on the way on the paper as favorites but this guy was 90 95 kilo most of his career and then he
SPEAKER_02: didn't even take the competition in his class seriously. His main focus was pulling all those 120, 130, 140, 150 kilo guys, you know. Imagine you have a career and then pulling with guys that are like 50% heavier than you and they are like really giant guys. I mean, I think John is like, we are so lucky to have him in our sports. Anyway, so. Absolutely.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. So before, before we finish, do you guys have anything to tell each other lastly?
SPEAKER_02: And I realized that Reno came here, so like gentleman and so respectful. And then he also get a little bit, little bit you get in his skin, but little bit Terence when he's confident, you know? And like, yeah. And then Reno is probably thinking, ah, maybe I would just this respecting a little to the side. I mean, of course, he's not gonna tell you anything disrespectful, but I think at the table,
SPEAKER_01: He will be. I definitely I have immense respect for Terrence just because he I think in my eyes, he's definitely one of the legends of the sport just because he's been fighting for so many years and he had matches with one of the and the best arm wrestlers of that era. And he beat a lot of them. So it's on one hand, it's an honor to arm wrestle with someone like him. And of course, I would wish him the best of luck.
SPEAKER_01: and I hope he comes prepared so the match isn't too boring for the viewers and for myself. That's all I would say. Come here very well prepared, otherwise the match will be boring, Terence. Anything to answer? Yes, I'm definitely prepared. I have a few days left to train.
SPEAKER_00: So if I can be still injury free at the time I'm starting to rest, I think he's going to have a run for his money. My training went very well. I was training maybe three months before arm wars. I started to train intensely, so I didn't stop training. I had a problem with my left arm.
SPEAKER_00: Every day I train, then I have to rest seven days for the pain to go away. So I was struggling with my left arm for a while. Until arm wash, it healed up pretty nicely. But after arm wash, when I got invited to East vs West, I didn't train left anymore because it's wasting some time. You can do more quality training on the right arm. So I was only training right arm. So yeah, I pulled with my club.
SPEAKER_00: They are far from me. It's an hour and a half drive. So I had not too much stable time, but I feel confident of the weights and the pulleys and the elastics and the cables and the stuff I was doing. So I'm definitely prepared. So, yeah, I don't think it's going to be boring. So tell him not to worry for you, you know. He should worry for himself, right, Terence? Yeah, what I can tell him is don't worry about the match. I'll give the crowd the show. Don't worry.
SPEAKER_00: Nice. I'm glad to hear that. I know you can only flash pins, so nobody's going to see that, but I'll make sure to match it up and give the crowd a show and look like I'm struggling a little bit. Nice. Sure. Wow. So that is, you really put the guy to the bed, right? Yeah, I understand that. I'm going to tell you something, Terence. Have you ever seen something like
SPEAKER_02: Arsene Liev in Bulgaria. What do you think about that guy's shape? It was too much, right? No, it was too much. No, it was too much. The first match, I maybe stopped him for a split second, but after that, there was nothing. I'm not talking only about your match, but people, other people as well in that event. But what I just tried to say, how would he do today under five kilos?
SPEAKER_02: Could he have a chance against Ron Garber? No, definitely. If you just think about who he has beaten at his prime, he got pins on Denis Aplenkov, he beat Pushkar, he beat all the best guys in the world. Yeah, but we need to really explain a little bit that Denis and Pushkar killed each other, because I also talked with Arsene. The guy is realistic enough that he said that he was in best shape ever.
SPEAKER_02: even better than the shape that you saw him. He went just to beat Dennis, he said. And he said Radical came and he hit Dennis as he has never hit anyone else.
SPEAKER_02: and he said he hit a wall and then it's just beat him in one second and he said next next day if he has so much soreness he said like a bus hit him and he said that i said was the match long he said no he beat me in one second but but because the pressure was so hard you know so what the the
SPEAKER_02: arsene at any shape cannot beat dennis unless the guy is tired that he pulled with push car they killed each other even he was a very tough man but it doesn't take anything away from arsene which was a hundred kilo the other guy is 140 kilo almost 50 bigger than him it doesn't take but arsene maybe like the best in his category i don't know like
SPEAKER_00: It depends on his shape. I think that's the deciding factor of how well he will perform. Yeah, I agree. It depends on what's the composition. In 2015, he was ranked number one under 100 kilograms in the world. Do you remember when you were still doing the rankings? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. To compare it to today, because the bar is keep on rising. So I think if he stayed in the sport, he will still be on that level. But I think if he's going to try to come back now, it's going to be a little bit more difficult for him.
SPEAKER_02: He's still young he's still young I think he was born in 1987 he's only 36 years old, and he is not a beginner if he comes in a year, I think he will be ready, I almost convinced him almost everything was ready and the world started and. His name was on the list, you know.
SPEAKER_02: like they didn't take him but they could you understand and he was like oh and just i mean i lost my motivation i tried again again again it didn't work anymore but i really i almost set the matches you know almost but like unfortunately it just uh let's see let's see i hope everything everything will be fine and i see you guys very soon in three weeks and then i hope we were gonna have fun
SPEAKER_02: good time together and yeah for sure we will for sure yeah i wish you guys the best i i will be very happy to host you guys and remember you guys are our superstars
SPEAKER_02: yeah i don't care about the other sports superstars this is our support and you guys are our superstars and hope to see you guys and thank you very much for joining and just please don't lose anything from your confidence i want to see two guys there to continue with the dreams you know instead of just having a little break you know yeah yeah take care guys thank you thank you everyone who watches
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, guys. Bye.
