SPEAKER_00: um
SPEAKER_03: Hello, Adnan. Hello, Phil. Hello, Pete Dobbs, 44% stronger. Hello, Aaron. Hello to Costa Rica. Hello, Magnus. Greetings, Sanj, Tain, Carlos. Hello, guys. Hello, Mike. You hear me?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, sir. I mean, let me just connect here. I got you. Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, I hear you. Yeah. Okay. You see me? Yeah. Okay. So I think we never met before. I think person heavy. Yeah, we never met. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think the times that I stopped visiting the US are the times that you rise up. I kind of started, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So how have you been, people? The camera doesn't stay solid, right, somewhere? It will be very hard for you to hold it all.
SPEAKER_03: podcast. Yeah, yeah. I mean, if it stays, otherwise, it's moving. Yeah, I was gonna ask you people, people, there are comments that they are saying you and like, they're worried about your shape.
SPEAKER_03: and but whenever i look at now you look like you're in good shape how do you feel or you want to wait luckman to come and share this or you can already start it's totally up to you but we are live now you broke up a little bit i'm sorry oh yeah i was asking you about your shape okay
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I'm back in the gym hard. You know, I'm training every day, six days a week. Arm wrestling training, table time. I'm training with my team in New York. And, you know, I feel strong. I'm back to what I was before I was injured. So I feel very confident. Ready? You are ready? Yes. Okay, that's good. That's all I wanted to hear because...
SPEAKER_03: know every arm master that comes to east versus west we would like to see them again and again and again you know guys i think when there are two people in this uh zoom it doesn't have the gallery view when it needs to be minimum three and i think when lachlan comes i think he will be seen all three of us okay yeah the people are asking that it needs to be the multi-camera gallery view but um
SPEAKER_02: And you just watched your opponent last week, his performance. What do you think? Was it intimidating for you or is it like? He looks good. He looks good. I'm not going to, you know, he definitely leveled up from the last time we pulled. He definitely got better. He put on some size. But I still think that, you know, my arm is superior to his.
SPEAKER_02: uh in in every way shape and form uh you know i'm bigger i'm stronger i'm faster so i'm not i'm not intimidated by him uh whatsoever but um i do we're friends i i talk to lachlan you know all the time on instagram and and everything else so um definitely no respect for the guy i like him but um you know as far as arm wrestling is concerned he's he's not at my level oh
SPEAKER_03: well that that is i normally normally i do my best to you know get some trash talk and then now it looks like i won't i won't be trying hard you know yeah yeah so what you are saying basically that where he is going is where your a game is yeah inside so yeah i mean we both we both know where it's going to go it's going to go inside uh you know we're going to go on for arm
SPEAKER_02: and see who's stronger. So it's definitely going to be a good match. He's strong inside. I mean, he definitely has a good hook. I think mine's a little better. I have more experience. My arm is longer. My levers are better. I think, like I said, I'll pose a problem for him with my length and my strength right now. I understand. So you are very confident and you are saying to your fans who support you, don't worry about me.
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to win. It's what you're saying. Yeah, I'm coming in ready, definitely. That's good. That's good. That's good. I won because I know his shape. I just saw his shape. He's ready. But you are a question mark. Not that Mike Aiello is a question mark, but your current form was a question mark. So it's good. It's good to know that you are ready. It's good. Yeah, definitely.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's very good. I'm very happy. When was the last time you competed? Actually, two weeks ago. I went to Poland, had a tournament in Pennsylvania, and I won pretty much. I won pretty easy. I felt strong. My timing was on. I felt very comfortable at the table. It's been a year and a half since I pulled.
SPEAKER_03: so i think the last time i saw you was that the four ways chance show and yeah yeah yeah was it the last time no i pulled um las vegas i pulled uh eric's photo uh okay how was that matches can you remind me how was the result uh i won yeah i won three nothing uh oh you you beat him oh yeah i beat him three nothing yeah so that was the last time i pulled was november of 2021.
SPEAKER_03: And then I took a long break and now I'm going to, I came back to Paul Lynch tournament. I did, I did pretty well. Okay. So about one and a half years, a little bit more than one and a half years. And, you know, when, when you sometimes, you know, take maybe not like three, four years, but one and a half years. But I think that correct me if I am wrong, but you are type of guy that even you don't arm muscle, you train. Is that true? Or like you're like a gym guy, you know, is it correct or?
SPEAKER_02: I changed my training up a lot more, a lot more volume. I'm talking about in the gym. I train a lot more smarter now. I'm not throwing around crazy weights and getting, you know, I have had too many injuries. So, yeah, I definitely was training the whole time.
SPEAKER_03: But they want to help you to heal up those minor injuries and everything. Now you are physically ready. Yeah, my arm feels great. Yeah, my arm feels great. Yeah, that's good. That's good. That's good. Yeah. Do you feel excited to be on that stage with all those other top pullers together?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, thank you very much for the invite. Yeah, it was like a dream come true. I mean, this is like the Super Bowl of arm wrestling right now. I mean, it's amazing. Just to be a part of the East versus West is amazing. Yeah, it will be great to see you. You are a strong athlete and you are entertaining. People are asking me, you know, when Mike comes, you know, he should be allowed to arm wrestle without the T-shirts.
SPEAKER_03: i'm not even bringing a shirt to parakeet you know i'm gonna give you the t-shirt sponsored t-shirt but but we can talk about it we can talk about it yeah do you do you have a sponsor about tanning or something that's a good idea maybe i do uh my tanning salon uh beach bum tanning up yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: like for example when when when chan show goes to the stage not to the table you know he asked me if he could go with the first with those the hawaii type of yeah yeah and then i said yeah yeah you can and like normally we don't give that the hat thing but you know if justin bishop yeah yeah yeah so everyone has something um
SPEAKER_03: I have to say unique and yours is, you know, yeah, we can talk about it. Okay. Let, let me, let me just make a poll. Do you support Mike to pull without t-shirt? Oh, he's here. Look, he's here. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You need my phone sideways or this is good? How have you been, Lachlan? It's good to see you, my friend. How are you, my friend? Good, good. Great to see you. I just made a poll because a lot of people said, I mean, allow Mike to pull without T-shirts. You know, it's 10 in here.
SPEAKER_03: Michael, he's way too tan for me. Yeah. Congratulations. We saw you. Your shave was great. We were talking about it. I don't know if you followed the beginning, but I asked Mike if he was intimidated. He said, I don't give a shit. He's playing my own game and he's...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that's fine. I mean, it looks that way, but there's pressures there that you don't see there, Mike, so that's fine. Yeah, you're looking good, bro. Looking good. Yeah, well, I'm feeling good. You're looking big again, so that's good. Yeah, I'm trying, bro. Yeah, man. Yeah. I'm like 263, 264. 120 kilo, yeah. And you must be around 150, Lachlan?
SPEAKER_03: uh 113 115 yeah around that oh okay we're close we're close we're in range yeah yeah yeah and and Lachlan this guy is thinking that you are still that just guy that just began to arm wrestle and he still thinks that you know he will feel that uh the same guy Mike sorry about it I need to steer the boat
SPEAKER_04: I was like, I'm pretty sure Mike don't think that. But yeah, look, it's going to be very different. I actually have center table now. So, you know, before I just had bicep and that's what Mike was taking advantage of. But yeah, no, I've got some center table now these days, man. So it's nice for me. But no, I just hope you're in really good form, you know.
SPEAKER_04: hope all your strengths is getting back or, you know, at least on par with the weights that you're able to do, because I like beating guys when they're at the top. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, you don't want, you don't want like a domination, right? You want some good match. Yeah, so, yeah. The weekend gone past, no offense to Jordan Silva, but that was boring. That's not how I like to fight. I like having a real hard back and forth, you know, that's,
SPEAKER_04: That's where I get my kicks from, is hard matches, not easy days. Yeah, but do you feel like you can dominate him as well? Mike, it's very difficult, I think, to dominate someone who looks like that at 265. But I think I've probably done what I needed to to get my hand up to a point where it might look easier than it feels. Okay, okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Mike was talking more confident until you came. You came and Mike is just quiet. We'll see what happens in strap too. Pulling Jordan, I did an outsider strap and then on the after table,
SPEAKER_04: Um, I, I asked him to have a match inside strap, um, not a match, but a couple of rounds and he felt much easier, much, much easier inside the straps. So I probably would have had better straps. Definitely. Sorry. You definitely look stronger in the straps list. Yeah, definitely feel that way. Um, but you know, I've got the John.
SPEAKER_04: Job done outside of straps, but I think I'll probably need them for Mike. It's a lot longer arm and a lot more down pressure. So if I can get more of my back and chest behind it, that helps with the strap. I can get a lot more strap. Lachlan, Mike is a hook puller. And to go to strap with him, you need to really get out of his thing. I mean, if you are able to get out of his thing, you're going to also pin him as well, you know.
SPEAKER_04: Well, it's that rotation game. You know, Mike has, the way he hooks is a lot of down pressure. The way I hook is a lot of up and out here pressure. No, no, I'm talking about to manage to go to strap, you know, you need to get out of the guy's hand, you know. Are you going to do like this, you know?
SPEAKER_04: No, no, I've never had a problem slipping out the side. So obviously, everyone tries the top roll first. It's the smartest thing to do. It's just allows me to see where things are at. And if we go to strap, we go to strap never had a problem getting getting out. That's fine. Mike, have you ever top roll anyone? No one good. My mic doesn't hear us.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I keep getting a phone call. I apologize. Yeah, I mean, if he wants to go outside, I mean, I can definitely match him outside as well. I'll just go knuckles up and just try to use my light that way. That's fine. I can go either way. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. I didn't know that before I said this much. I didn't know that you guys have pulled before.
SPEAKER_03: and yeah luckily you reminded me and then after you told me i checked and yeah i saw the match and when was it when was it how many years ago four i think four about three years ago right three yeah three and a half yeah three yeah obviously and how long have you been putting luck on
SPEAKER_04: I've been pulling for a total of seven years now. It, it was an interesting time for me back then. Um, just to go back in history a little bit, I, I pulled Zloty, um, and I, and I won two matches. I had a good match with Zambalat and, um, but I got called on elbow fails. And then when I came home from that, I, um, I think I had one more event. And then shortly after I started training with Yanis Amelans, he was my coach and I think I trained with him for a couple months and then we flew out to Arizona.
SPEAKER_04: in June, I believe it was, out to John's place. So I had a couple of months of coaching from Giannis at that point, but I hadn't really been taking arm wrestling as serious. I was trying to balance powerlifting and arm wrestling for the first couple of years of my arm wrestling. And as we all know, you can't excel in both. So it was right around pulling Mike, I made that decision to
SPEAKER_04: go full-time with arm wrestling and then covert happened and what have you but that match mike was a stand-in i was meant to have paul in but he had uh injured his elbows so mike was like yeah i'm gonna be there anyway why not so he just turned up and uh beat the hell out of me did you did you feel like he was someone that you could finally beat someday or he felt like too much back then i think i just
SPEAKER_04: held him on my bicep and it was like you know when you trip over and you kind of fall slowly it was kind of like oh yeah the last match you actually tried to change it up a little bit it was I felt it was a little uncomfortable for a minute yeah I think you get it in your hand a little more and hold but um yeah too much too much back then so yeah
SPEAKER_04: learning experience and we all know whenever mr adair loses things go up rather quickly so that's fine and the the the revenge will be yours i believe so it will be i think i'm favorite on the polls it's weird but yeah i'm feeling feeling very confident my competition so far this season has been obviously very successful for me and i'm feeling healthy i mean even after this weekend i did a lot of after pulling my elbow
SPEAKER_03: fun so i'm feeling healthy and kind of ready to go already so yeah i wish it was this weekend i mean i might realize i'm a bit sorry this weekend i asked mike you know how his shape is because his fans are saying we haven't seen you for a while and mike said he he kept training and now he is even healthier because of not competing for one and a half years and
SPEAKER_03: he he feels very good this is what he says you know and 78 percent said that mike can compete without his t-shirts yeah okay make sure my time is on point okay versus summer in turkey so you're gonna be you're gonna be it's hot
SPEAKER_03: okay now i'm gonna ask a question to the fans a poll who is gonna win mike and lachlan who do you think that will have the more votes you're asking me yeah i'm just what do you think i just didn't start the poll yet i'm gonna now ask them and 150 people are watching us and who do you think that will be favored uh favorites you know
SPEAKER_04: the eyes of the fans right now the polls are looking like he's gonna win i'm actually the underdog which is good i like that i like to be uh i like to come because you've been active you've just been inactive that's all man like i've been super active so you know i'm fresh in the man's head where you know we're gonna go back a little while to get your last match so that's all it is yep okay
SPEAKER_03: now 53 percent Lachlan 56 no Lachlan is 61. okay it's getting changing because the new what 43 people what 53 47 Lachlan yeah let's see let's see how we do what's that what day are you arriving mike uh the uh when is it
SPEAKER_04: Your microphone is on. Thursday at 5 p.m. Thursday at 5 p.m., yeah. I get there Tuesday 5 a.m., I think. So, you know, my flight's a little bit longer. I'm glad you're not there the day before. Because I know you were saying, I'll just do it the day before. I'm like... I hate sitting around before a tournament, you know? Mike, I think you're arriving on, you said, Thursday? Yeah, I fly out Wednesday, right?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. We need to make sure that because you remember it was like a midnight and I told you to be careful about this. Yes. Yeah, I got I got a look at my. No, you are. You are. And I mean, one second. OK. No, you are arriving on twenty. Six, seven or six. Oh, yeah, because.
SPEAKER_03: because yeah same day it is 30 minutes after midnight on wednesday and then you are arriving on the same day oh right right right okay so you are arriving wednesday because i don't bring the north americans thursday i bring the eastern guys thursday and then north americans wednesday so they will have one extra day because of yes just yeah just to get situated yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: And it is like seven hours or eight hours of direct flights, you know? Yeah. Yeah. And you arriving on Tuesday, right? Tuesday 5am. Yeah. Yeah, yours is longer. So you come even a day earlier. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, it is close. 51% Lachlan, 49% Mike. This is very close, Paul. And there is a super chat field with Woody.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you for your super chat. Expecting an incredible hook war. Good luck. Chaps, he says. Yeah. I might disappoint you in top roll. Looks like it is not that easy to top roll him. No, it's not. Yeah, Mike is usually going there, yeah. Because everyone tries to top roll him. Yeah, I try not to go that way.
SPEAKER_04: No, I'm just going to be like awkwardly short. There's the game plan. I'll be as awkwardly short as I possibly can. If you sound like that here in Half Kings, be fine. We'll give you a riser. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That'd be nice. Stand on my little box. It'd be cute. Yeah. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_03: looks like it's gonna be a close match looks like and Mike for you does it like for Lachlan it is something you know he lost against you and then he wants to beat he wants to show that the things has been changed in last three and a half years and for you does it have any other meaning than
SPEAKER_02: pulling at the East versus West stage, or is it something that like, no, no, no, nothing has changed, you know, I'm still, you know, the better one. I mean, actually a few things have changed. I mean, he's, he's actually, you know, a legit polar now he's, you know, he's a name, uh, you know, he, he leveled up big time from four years ago to now in arm wrestling world. That's, that's a, that's a big difference. He put on a lot of weight. He's a, he's a completely different polar. So.
SPEAKER_02: Um, yeah, a few things have changed. Um, you know, I'm definitely taking this serious. I've been training hard and, um, yeah, it's definitely going to be a war. We're going to, you know, we're definitely going to go arm to arm, you know, it's going to go inside and we're going to see who has a better arm. Okay. A few things changed, but can you say accept the results? Oh, same results. A hundred percent. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. This is what I wanted to hear. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: listen i need to hype i need to have so you say this so it's just gonna
SPEAKER_04: fire locking up so that that's what i'm trying to do because yeah three three nothing absolutely yeah three nothing three nothing okay okay i'm looking forward to to not having a six rounder for a change just having like three that suits me to it that'd be great yeah fourth round i'm a bit tired i'm like ah i wish this was over a round ago so i tend to start quickly i'm not a slow starter so yeah
SPEAKER_03: yeah so six rounds would probably suit you but you know it's best of three uh best of five yeah yeah i like it a lot and luck do you have any any any negative you know like um i'll say feeling because of the experience you had it before or you are already over by thinking that i'm completely different
SPEAKER_04: And like, do you carry anything negative from that time to this time? Or in your mind, is everything is clear, you're confident? Everything's clear. And that's the thing, like, you know, last year I competed against, well, I only lost against multiple world champions in their respective weight classes.
SPEAKER_04: You know, you take losses like that, you get back to work, you know you've improved because, you know, there are metrics that we can measure. And I'm very, you know, I try to go to my opponents and go, what do you think I could have done that would have been better? And arm wrestling community, the way it is, they always tell me. So I know, you know, I get the best advice from the people that have, you know, probably the best authority to tell me what I need to do to fix as the guy who just beat me. So, you know, and I apply that and I do it very diligently.
SPEAKER_03: Got some very clever people in my corner. So yeah, I'm extremely confident that I'm a very, very different puller than I was four years ago. And I'm confident it's enough to get the job done. OK, that's good. Both sides are confident. I just can't wait. Yeah, it's perfect. Yeah, I'm very happy. So if you talk a little bit about the matches, other matches, how do you guys see, for example,
SPEAKER_03: Morozov versus Gennady Mesh. That's right-handed, right? Yeah, right-handed. Like, let me tell you what I feel first.
SPEAKER_03: just once the ready go comes and when they hit each other, I mean, I'm sure that while watching from the outside of the stage, I think my elbow will hurt, you know, just like, I will probably imagine the pressure. Seriously, this is how it happens, you know, I just came in. You know how strong they are and you know how stubborn they are, what kind of endurance they have. I don't know if there will be,
SPEAKER_04: a domination from either side which i don't really expect but we will see you know and what do you guys think just you can start you know you i'm expecting three to morozov i think he'll lose the first two rounds as he usually does and then he just something clicks and he powers through and he just out and jaws everyone and he's so young and so big like every time we see him he's just like
SPEAKER_03: percentage is better than than he was he's just he's a freak so I'm gonna I'm gonna have more results and and like what do you think a lot of people um how to say when I made it trading cards I made Levan's endurance nine and people just criticized me understand for that and just I was just thinking that just imagine Devon versus Gennady match they said that Ron won
SPEAKER_03: should be Devon's and he should have won 3-0 but imagine if it wasn't like best of five but it was full five rounds still Gennady won the last two rounds right so just because Devon lost last two rounds and just because of one match should we bring Devon's endurance to seven no right because he has proven a lot so this is the same thing you know when Levon beat
SPEAKER_03: Hermes first four rounds, and then while he had all 6-0, 6-0, 6-0 against the top guys, and Levan's match against Hermes wasn't full domination. A few times he stopped here, and then he had to beat, and the round three, he was almost losing. He got a foul, and they restarted beating him. You know, it was also like same like round five. So, but the point that I want to come is that Gennady,
SPEAKER_03: When you see how he performed round four and five against Devon, can you still be confident, Lachlan, that Morozov is losing the first two rounds and then coming back? What makes you feel that Morozov's endurance is better than Gennady, especially if Gennady can show a performance strong enough to win the first two rounds?
SPEAKER_04: I think it's less about endurance in this case, but more about Morris of learning, which lane is going to suit him best. Like he seems to learn from the two rounds and the third round, he does exactly what he needs to do in that third round. And then it's just, he just kind of repeats it. So maybe in that case, yeah, less endurance, more, um, or the right, you know, the, the right line.
SPEAKER_03: he's got options like morozov can really go anywhere so it looks like morozov is your favorite puller because gennady is also a very experienced guy you know he has been around almost 20 years and he is also someone to learn something during the match as well you know like like when i watch round one when devon just took everything and started talking and doing this i was like oh what a mismatch it's over
SPEAKER_03: but it didn't end up like this because he did something completely different in the restart. I don't know if you guys expected or not, but I didn't expect. If Devon started talking with you round one, normally you would think that
SPEAKER_03: the rest of the rounds will get easier and easier and easier and easier. But I don't disagree. I'm not saying that I disagree with you, but he's also very, I mean, like a guy that you cannot underestimate. This is what I just think. Yeah, you're probably right. You can't count him out. I mean, what's that, Mike? I said he can't really you can't count him out. I mean, he he
SPEAKER_02: has a ton of endurance. I mean, look at the Chafee match. Look at the Devon match. I mean, I met him in Moldova, I believe. He was sitting down and his back was so wide. I was like, holy shit. He's just a monster. But also, I mean, Marzov too. I mean, a kid, he's the future of the sport, obviously. He's probably the next LeVon. But, you know, I wouldn't put my money on that match at all. I wouldn't even know really where to
SPEAKER_03: to go either way, it can go either way, I think. Yeah, definitely. It'll be a war no matter what. That's the, I think we all, we can all agree that it's going to be a long, a long match. Yeah. Anyway, so yeah, I just, I just can't wait. I just can't wait. And many of those matches that we, okay, by the way, Paulie is Mike.
SPEAKER_03: 53%, Lachlan 47%. After 143 votes, yeah. Probably because I'm being so nice. It's what? What? Probably because I'm being so nice. Yeah. Anyway, so let's go to some other matches.
SPEAKER_03: one second let me find the list yeah right here okay we have pablo versus sandras i think i think lachlan lachlan is experienced with both atlas one is left arm you pull left-handed pablo yeah and right-handed um depends which version of sandras is coming because
SPEAKER_04: people forget the version of sandras i got was 10 kilos heavier than he normally competes uh he was 122 kilos when i versed him and then he competes at 110 uh and what have you um so if he brings a 122 kilo version of sandras i'll give it to him
SPEAKER_04: Pavlo, extremely strong. He's arm wrestles in like in a real like raw power way. But Sandrus does pose some technical efficiencies that perhaps Pavlo will struggle with. I think I'll probably give it to Sandrus to be honest, but I think Pavlo will do an excellent showing.
SPEAKER_03: especially early rounds you think this uh paulo will be effective because it's strange until today we didn't see paulo doing super good with the endurance but sometimes if you can dominate the opponent you know then it doesn't go to the endurance game so so you are are you saying that like paulo is at least as strong as sundries but sundries has maybe more options to
SPEAKER_04: I mean, the numbers, they're very different. I mean, Pavlo is a big raw power guy. He benches, how much does he bench? Like 210, 220, something like that? Kilograms? He's very strong. He's a super strong guy, yeah. Sandra struggles doing half that. But it doesn't seem to bother him in his way that he arm wrestles. Also, like, Pavlo's hand is smaller than mine, and he really needs to keep his hand. And then Sandra, who's got a big hand, he's just all out in his hands. So he's just going to get...
SPEAKER_04: His hand and wrist is going to blow up. And I think if Sanders bends it back once, it's done. It just turns to rubber and he'll be out. But if Pavlo can keep his wrist, it's a really interesting match. I don't believe he has a press. I haven't seen Pavlo utilize a press effectively, a flop wrist press. He should have with all that kind of, you know, pushing, pushing.
SPEAKER_04: This is the argument. The Georgians, you know, the Georgians just say, like, you don't need to bench any more than 200 kilos if you're a bencher, as an arm wrestler. And we got a lot of big benchers. I'm talking about for the press, you know, like, I think... Yeah, what I'm saying is they get the big bench, but they don't seem to be able to commit inside and be able to use it in an arm wrestling match. Big benchers always think they are here. I've never seen a big bencher really commit inside. Jerry?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he's the exception, though. I figured him out. I figured him out. Next time you look at him, you know how no one can do what he does, right? He's humorous as, like, half the length of everybody else. His tricep is, like... Yeah, and he's real short from here to here. So, yeah, he can just jam up and get in that spot forever. He'll never break his arm because it's this long. Mike, how do you see this match? Like...
SPEAKER_02: i'm gonna go pablo uh first two matches he's gonna blow right through sandras um and then i think he's i think sandras is a better arm wrestler pablo's stronger and hopefully his arm doesn't blow up this time the last the last outing i saw sandras uh versus jordan i believe um didn't look too but he looked a little flat um it wasn't like the same guy that i saw when he pulled lachlan and he pulled everyone else you know um but then like i said um pablo
SPEAKER_02: beating Marcio Barbosa and the way he's been looking is amazing. So, I mean, that's a tough match. I'm going to go Pablo first two matches. Hopefully he doesn't blow up and he's got it. Yeah. I agree. Go ahead, Lachlan. Sorry. I was saying I agree. I agree. If Pablo can keep his hand, if he doesn't blow up, should get it done.
SPEAKER_03: okay i don't know how to pronounce the last name but john mack and shania sorry about this a super match lachlan versus terence southern king yeah yeah let me let me what's that
SPEAKER_04: The South Africans have been up my ass about that match for over a year. Okay. Okay. Let's do that. Let's do this. Let's do this at some point, you know. Let's do this at some point. Yeah. That's good. Terence is also coming. Aftertable, if I deal with him the way I think I'll deal with Terence on the aftertable, he won't want to match with me. Oh. He won't? No, he'll stay in South Africa. He won't want to. It'll be easy.
SPEAKER_03: Too easy for you. Yeah, yeah. Wow. Terrence also is dangerous guy. I don't know. That's it. That's it. He used to be. He used to be. Oh, does the same apply to Mike? No. No, right? No, Mike only took, what, a year off. Terrence had, like, 15 years off. Yeah, Terrence was killing it back in the day, man. He was the man.
SPEAKER_04: what i mean back then it was awesome i i'd never take that away from him he was the best and i how has he aged you know i don't know like there's a lot of tournaments and stuff he was he was killing it yeah absolutely i agree but uh i think uh i think it's a different different realm now yeah i think for guys like engen and john and todd you guys had to be the very top to be able to hang with the young guys now and terence wasn't at the very top and
SPEAKER_03: Hmm. So I think it's going to be a different ball game, but we'll see. Okay. Then let's go to this one. I want, I want just to like percentage, nothing else percentage. You're going to say 70%, this guy, 30%, this guy, just example, but I don't want any kind of, uh, explanation or anything. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: It is Lachlan Adair versus Mike Aiello. 100, 100. Okay, okay. We couldn't hear. Say again? 100. 100 for Lachlan and then of course nothing for Mike. And Mike? Nothing, no. The same thing, just opposite.
SPEAKER_03: yeah okay another question latin mike having his t-shirt on or not does it make some difference to me no but you know you gotta ask the refs maybe they get dazzled and and don't see elbow flying okay okay and it just imagine that mike comes to like table or one of the rounds he goes like
SPEAKER_03: you know like are you gonna complain to the referees that he needs to put the shirt on or you are like okay huh it's fine i can do what mike does i'm gonna keep my pale my pale shirt okay let's go this one is chance show versus oleg petrenko oleg oleg is gonna beat him yeah
SPEAKER_03: How do you see him beating him? How? Straight side pressure, top roll hook? I think Oleg will do what he wants. What's that? I think Oleg will do what he wants. Oh.
SPEAKER_02: not sure about that one like for example who can chance show is just you can't hook chance yeah if you try to hook chance he'll make you look stupid yeah you just go and then he just yeah he's got a move where it just he'll he'll on your hand and luck lucklin what do you think about you versus chance can you look if you ask arden taranenko no chance for him he pulls with him all the time i just pulled out him and he was like no
SPEAKER_03: don't even bother so you're gonna you would beat him huh okay so you are up there like to pull you are ready to pull both terence and chance okay yeah okay and and how much is this much do you do are you familiar with petrenko um i i got i got chance chance is my boy um
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, unless this guy has serious side pressure, that's really the only way to really beat Chance, like how Todd Zilla beat him. You don't want to go inside with Chance. I don't know. I'm not really too familiar with his style if he goes inside. But I got Chance. Yeah, I mean, you may beat Chance inside, but the problem is to hook him, to get him there. Very difficult. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: donnie anderson thank you for your super chat great matchup i have to go with my boy mike beast right now my halo is 55 and latin 45 after almost 200 volts 197 volts okay then let's go a few other matches do you guys know tom's tom's roses latin do you know him
SPEAKER_03: The Latvian guy. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Presa. Yeah, I mean, he just, you know, goes like side pressure. He just won the Europeans with left arm. He's going to pull Justin Bishop. Oh. Is that righty or lefty? Right arm, right arm, right arm, yeah. I'm going to... I think it's close, but I think Justin has got...
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I can't tell you why. I just feel like Justin's got it. I feel like he's got a little bit more conditioning, a little bit more density, you know, more experience as well. I think if Justin turns up in shape, he will have what it takes and get the job done. But don't ask me for a score. I don't know. It's a hard match, though. It's hard.
SPEAKER_03: Thomas, very strong, very talented. Thomas is, yeah, a strong guy, but Justin is also. Justin beat Mindago's two rounds. I remember it's not that easy to do that. Yeah. I don't know. There is a question. They're asking, Knox asking, what's the replacement match for Totila versus Rob? I ask the...
SPEAKER_03: 105 kilo AMC champion Ibrahim Sago to pull Tata Shins. And Ibrahim Sago accepted. Todd hasn't answered yet. So we will see. And probably you don't know the Thomas, right, Mike? I'm not too familiar with him, no. Yeah. Okay. How about Wagner Bortolato versus Ferit Osmanlı, left arm?
SPEAKER_03: I go Wagner. You go Wagner? Yeah. Is it because Ferit also goes inside and then when you go inside with Wagner, you push his shoulder? Is that the logic? Yeah. The press is ridiculous. He's so fast. He's so strong, explosive. And you, Lockton? Yeah, it's hard. I mean, Wagner hasn't been successful in his last few outings, no? So...
SPEAKER_03: And Ferret has been, well, he lost his last match, right? He lost to Corey, Corey 3-2, he lost, yeah. And Corey was effective against Ferret with this, almost the same thing that, you know, Wagner is doing. He put his shoulder forward pressure. I'm going to go Wagner. Wagner's just got decades of him doing that.
SPEAKER_03: with a lot of success. Yeah. I mean, it would be a good match. They're all good matches, but I'd probably add Wagner for that one. Yeah, if Ferit wants to win, he needs to take Wagner's hand quickly to this side so Wagner's hand can be out. Because if Wagner puts the shoulders, I mean, you really need a very strong bicep to just lift him up from there, you know. But we will see. And Rino Matic versus Terence Opperman.
SPEAKER_03: Are you guys familiar, Mike, with Reno, the young guy? I don't know him. I'm familiar, obviously, with Terrence. So I'm going to go with Terrence, even though he's, I don't know. Has he been active at all? Terrence, yeah, yeah. He just competed in an event at the Armors. He beat the Mindaugas. What's his last name? The heavyweight guy. Mindaugas. Yeah, I don't know. He beat him, I saw. And he said that he's in very good shape.
SPEAKER_03: And Reno is only 18 years old. He just won European Championships, both in juniors and also in seniors. Yeah, yeah. And you follow Reno Locklear? Yeah, I follow Reno. He doesn't look like much.
SPEAKER_04: like in terms of muscularity and density and all that stuff, but that kid's strong. He's real strong. And he knows how to execute. He's got a top roll. He's got a hook. He's got a press. He's just one of those younger kids that are coming up who just know how to do all of it. Without the nonsense about Terence, so without bias, I would give it to Reno. He's just so talented.
SPEAKER_03: very explosive at the center he he has been competing only the like europeans and wars so only doping tested events and he is doing very good you know and elizabeth you do you know elizabeth mike elizabeth yeah right she's a very good friend of mine yeah mosek yeah she's very she's a good friend of mine
SPEAKER_03: yeah and do you know carolina peterson yes yeah that's how you see i mean carolina is much more experienced but elizabeth looks very strong she looks very strong carolina is also very strong um i think elizabeth will have about five kilo the weight
SPEAKER_03: edge you know she's been looking really good lately she she she's always training i mean no one now trains elizabeth i mean she's yeah yeah i see that and i think that they are more focused on their match than many of the guys are and yeah they are like yeah the the woman competition is always you know uh they are like you know yeah
SPEAKER_02: and what do you think that do you think that elizabeth is ready for an international challenge i think i think she's ready i mean the last couple of outings she's looking really good um you know like i keep in touch with her you know on facebook or whatever and instagram and stuff and um yeah she's i think she's ready to go i think you know i think she's proven herself
SPEAKER_03: I think she's getting better and better and better. I think she's already strong, but I think every day maybe she's transferring her power to the table. The more technical she becomes, I think the more dangerous she will become as well. Do you know these ladies, Lachlan? No. It's funny. The women's arm wrestling, I always find they put on some of the best matches, but I don't follow it, unfortunately.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, there is Timur Mamedov. It would be a very good match between AMC champion 85 kilo Sarmat Deguro versus David Samusha. My friend David Samusha already accepted that match and I am waiting an answer from Sarmat today, latest tomorrow. You know, for me, the athletes are not divided to AMC, King of the Table, Armwars or something. For me, athletes are athletes and
SPEAKER_03: as long as they deserve to be here like so much like he won the last two amc when the guy is the guy deserves to be there so of course i'm gonna invite those are all brothers and sisters in arm wrestling
SPEAKER_03: and so let's go daniel prokopchuk versus emil amir do you guys know these guys i think when you went to moldova yes you were in moldova as well latin or only you were mike i know that you were there and do you remember do you remember there was a 70 kilo match i don't know if you follow that one guy top role daniel in the uh primarily
SPEAKER_03: and they had a long long match okay this is the guy emil is the guy that toppled and even pinned daniel there was protest rematch a long long happened you know so these guys uh will pull with left arm and even with left arm they have long history some of the events emil ended up winning the gold some of the events daniel ended up winning so this is for the world title
SPEAKER_03: And another thing before you guys answer, a lot of people have been asking me about Alan Zolaev. Guys, Alan Zolaev, I contacted through Arsen Liliyev, I contacted through Ajumrat Zolaev, and I finally contacted him directly. And he said, Engin, his situation, I think he is in an army school or like academy or something. He cannot get out of Russia.
SPEAKER_03: as long as it is an official event like WAF or something, you know, and he said that as of now, he doesn't have this possibility. And once he has this possibility, the same day, you know, you know me, and then I'm going to invite him and we're going to post him if the guy is the best we want. We want the
SPEAKER_03: I don't know, Andre, if Sarma is in the same university or not, but Sarma said that he's going to answer me today or tomorrow, ladies. And anyway, so I already contacted them. And Alan said that Engin is honored, and as soon as there is an opportunity, he will reach me. So don't think that I'm excluding anyone, that they will be here, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, what do you guys know about this, Mike? I'm sure that after that time, you didn't follow Emil so much, but probably you have been seeing Daniel at the East versus West. Yeah, Daniel, I wouldn't put my money or I wouldn't bet against Daniel ever in his weight class. He is just on another level. That kid is insane. What he did to even the US guys, I mean, we put our best against him, and I think he was laughing at the table against...
SPEAKER_04: Corey Miller or something. I forgot who it was. But he's, yeah, he's, I'm going to go Daniel every time. I don't care if it's righty or lefty. He's, that guy's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. And Lockton, you know Daniel, but do you know Emi? Yeah. Yeah, I know both. I know Daniel much better. So I'm going to go with Daniel. I think he's been much more active with really big matches. And I think that we're probably, yeah,
SPEAKER_03: make a difference this time i know they pulled in moldova but maybe that's going to uh edge daniel forward this time okay there is one more thing that i may do uh okay i said mindagas versus yanis yanis got injured from his elbow and and then
SPEAKER_03: I said Doug Ehrlich against Mindaugas. Doug Ehrlich also got hurt. And then that match is also canceled. And now, right now, as of now, I'm riding with Makaro since this morning. Makaro, I asked him, Arthur, you know, what level are you? He said, Engin, I just competed there.
SPEAKER_03: uh amc he said he is around 75 of his best and i said he wanted to pull at this event and i said maybe mindagos but you know if you are pulling mindagos you need to be ready and you cannot be um yeah
SPEAKER_03: yeah see he accepted so a match is just set you know yeah so um for me those set in those matches usually takes like 20 30 minutes you know but i just checked the messages yeah i remember when when levan got injured so he couldn't pull morozo
SPEAKER_03: It was like after midnight, I just called Gennady. He was with his friend that speaks English. 15 minutes, we set the match. I don't know why it sometimes takes so long for some other people. But for me, it's just like 15, 20 minutes. I think it was Les who sent me one message. It was like five words. And I was like, yeah. Because we speak the same language. I'm not an organizer. Yeah, I organize something, but I don't identify myself as an organizer.
SPEAKER_03: And our master engine is our missing Mike our message Lachlan brothers in arms so hey luckily you want to pull this guy yeah Mike yeah. This is how it is no need to be so. Official you know, like you know, looking everything you know yeah I hope I hope we will grow and then we will be we will be doing even better than this yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Adnan, the t-shirts will be ready very, very soon, you know. Yeah, very, very soon. And I also asked Mindaugas three options. I said Arthur, Emil, and Christo, and he said he wants Arthur. Anyways, guys, so this, if you talk a little bit more about
SPEAKER_03: what's going on in the arm wrestling world. How do you guys see everything? How do you guys see? What would you like to see? And you saw the last AMC event. I don't know if you guys watch the videos or not. Like for example, there will be Devon versus Gennady match, the rematch. Do you guys expect
SPEAKER_03: totally different outcome. What do you guys think about that match, the first match? Do you guys think that it is all because of the referee or because Devon also a little bit started playing too early? Do you guys agree that if I say that Devon is someone that he feels himself more like the face of arm wrestling and he is more focused on
SPEAKER_03: promoting arm wrestling, then just focus on the, I need to win, I need to win. The guy, you understand, he's just really selling his matches, you know? And I kind of think that it is a little bit affecting his performance time to time, you know? How do you guys saw that match, the last match? Start maybe my viewers. Yeah, I mean, I have Devin in the rematch. It was a combination of two things. It was the elbow fouls and him just not, you know, finishing the match.
SPEAKER_03: you know he's sitting there talking to him you know um if he just goes in there and does what he has to do i think i got devin on the next one okay do you expect that well also do you guys do you guys like how do you guys think you guys want to see all
SPEAKER_03: five rounds to be pulled? Or do you guys see after one reaching three, the other rounds are unnecessary? How do you guys see? Do you guys realize that
SPEAKER_03: Like when you reach to three, zero, or if it's best of six or seven, you know, four rounds, you know, it is technical knockout. It is submission. There is, I don't see any other sport in wrestling or UFC or boxing when the other guy have no chance to win anymore.
SPEAKER_03: the match at that point is finishing boxing can go to 12 rounds you can beat the out of a guy 11 rounds but there is still a little possibility that that guy can knock you out on the round 12 but after three after four there is no returning you know there is there is no possibility to other guy to win but do you think maybe we did this because the arm wrestling matches sometimes can be too short and just to entertain people more and more
SPEAKER_02: And how do you guys think? Like, do you see another example that, you know, a match continues after the result is finalized, you know? I'd rather do the three. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Do you want to go? No, no, no. You start first. Go ahead and go. I'd rather go three. If it's three nothing, I'd rather just walk off the table. Just as far as just injury purposes, you know, just I don't think that's really necessary to keep going, but.
SPEAKER_04: um i would i'd rather see if i was three zero i would just that would be it yeah it's two parts you know like if you've been beaten three zero and you want to try and you know you want an opportunity to to get around maybe two rounds to feel like you redeemed yourself i think that's probably why arm wrestlers do it because like we're not knocked out we're not incapacitated we just lost so i think often arm wrestlers like
SPEAKER_03: they lose three zero they want that opportunity just to get one but for me personally i i'm not a fan once it's four like once you lose you know and the match is done i'd rather just go you know yeah there's one guy said that the football can be like seven zero in the lead for yourself there is still possibly the other guy other team to win eight seven you know that's why the match continues and there is a time limit to win there with the the match you know
SPEAKER_03: Um, anyway, so, uh, I think Mike, where's Mike, Mike is here and yeah. Okay. And, and what did you think, uh, Lachlan about the Devon versus Gennady rematch and the first match, did you say your opinion or I missed it? Look, I think if Devon quits all the theatrics and just puts his head down and get to work, like he used to get the job done. I think he spent too much time trying to put on a show.
SPEAKER_03: and uh it worked against him so i think you know shaves his head gets the work and i think they want to talk that trash you know like before the match most of the time i think affects the opponent his opponents in a negative way but i kind of feel that once once he talks and the other guy is not affected like gennady is very strong in the mind it may be
SPEAKER_03: just turn onto him this time, you know, to Devon, you know, because he's a little bit depending on getting into the mind of the opponent, while what I saw personally, Gennady didn't give a shit about it, you know, just like, okay, you can talk. Yeah. And yeah. There was a lot of opportunity for Devon to finish it earlier and then ended up getting tied and pulled out of position. So yeah, actually just...
SPEAKER_03: quits all the nonsense during match and just gets to it, I think he'll get the job done. Yeah. There is, there is, there is, uh, I don't know if I should say already, but most likely Devon and his son. Um, I don't know how to pronounce his name. Alden. Is that correct? Alden. Okay. Yeah. And.
SPEAKER_03: I think they are going to come together and then I think that we will have a small camp in my city. We will come for training. Because he wants his son
SPEAKER_03: to be like, how to say, to have very wide perspective on arm wrestling. No one knows arm wrestling very, very well, but like even I, or I can say that Kazakhs have their own methods, Georgians have their own, I have my own. Just say Latvians, they have, Krasimir and other Bulgarians, they have their own. So there are different
SPEAKER_03: equals you know like like methods you know so i think that devon wants his son to see all the perspectives you know and then yeah i think he's serious about it will be an honor for me if they um come and then we are already in touch i think it's gonna be finalized it will be an honor and it will be good uh let's see how the match will go between gennady and devon i just really don't know
SPEAKER_03: and after that after that where do you guys see the top top top guys what are your like top rankings like who is that one is number one yeah yeah no one's touching him for the next 10 years and then who do you see oh by the way one second one second the most important match i just left it to the end yeah and then i forgot jerry versus hermes let's go
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I love Jerry. He's my man. But Hermes is my coach. I'm going with Hermes. I'm sorry, Jerry. I mean, if he wasn't my coach, I'd be going for you. So is that how you analyze the matches?
SPEAKER_03: no no that's that's why i want to hear i want to hear some technical you know opinions you know instead of this is my coach but i love this guy you know you are you are a top level arm master i want to see how this how do you say in english breakdown the breakdown yeah yeah look they're they're on opposite ends of the scale aren't they we've got guys he's just you know only smart people you know top role and then you got jerry that pressure that he applies is
SPEAKER_04: It's unlike anything else. No one else does it. And it's just, he can do it forever. If it gets drawn out into a long match, I think Jerry will have it. But if Hermes is quick enough and can get Jerry way outside of his shoulder and be as explosive as we all know him to be, then I think it'll be quick. Your heart is with Hermes.
SPEAKER_03: Your heart is with Hermes. Your heart is with Hermes. And your mind is saying that if Hermes doesn't make a mistake, he can win. But if he makes a mistake and if the match goes to the endurance game, it's going to be a hard night for Hermes. I think so. Jerry's the sort of guy who waits for you to make a mistake. That's the problem. He's just this constant unending pressure that if you adjust, he just fills the gaps.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's a real, I mean, you're putting together an amazing matching and I'm deflecting this question. It's good, it's good, it's good. You know, I want armwrestling to reach to the level and this is, we are all together doing that, you know, we deserve, you know, armwrestling deserves much more. And many years we are like, you know, we are armwrestling, armwrestling, armwrestling, you know, just like, come on.
SPEAKER_03: Now I want people to say, oh, you are an arm master. I want that kind of reaction more and more. WAL helped this a lot. PAL helped this a lot. And WAF is helping a lot because people underestimate WAF. But every guy that you see at the East versus West stage
SPEAKER_03: I can say around 90, 95% are coming from WAF. You're talking about Laletin, you're talking about Levon Wilkham, you talk about Morozov, you talk about Ermes, Kidirgali, Irakli, Sasho, like all of them, you know, like except some Americans,
SPEAKER_03: these guys you know at every WAP event there is around like 1500 competitors age 15 age 18 age under 23 now seniors and then these guys just this is like a factory factory is just producing new guys and then from there the ones that they are showing themselves we look at them and say okay come here you know so we need to really
SPEAKER_03: Like you may not like how it is like some other politic things or something, but if you are attacking WAF, you are doing wrong. This is probably the best organization in the world. Anyway, so what were we talking about? Yeah, and you, Mike. I'm going to go with Jerry, just because style-wise, the only way to really beat a top roller is a really good press.
SPEAKER_02: And Jerry could just sit in that press for 10 minutes if he wants to. So I'm going to go Jerry. If he can get Hermes before he starts pronating and really, because he pulls back first and then he starts pronating. If he could just jump on him and press him, I think Jerry's going to do it.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that Hermes is like only all about the like outside or do you think that for this specific match he may have something different preparation or you think that it's just too short time to develop something to
SPEAKER_03: match against the side, you know, because you remember that what a few times Devin did in the Mohegan Sun match, Ron and John just with this side of their hand, they blocked the arm before he put the tricep. Yeah. To me, he can pull in any position. Of course, outside skill is incredible. And if he didn't have the flock,
SPEAKER_03: not to fall but the shoulder pressure he would even have some hard time with uh against dave cheffy yeah but yeah that that is just if he didn't have that that shoulder pressure i would say that his job would be much harder against jerry to finish and so you are are you thinking that you know ms may surprise us with coming with a different strategy than just classic top role do you think it's gonna be ending up you know that way anyways
SPEAKER_02: I mean, how he looked versus LeVon was amazing. So, I mean, he stopped LeVon a few times. So I was like, you can't really count him out either.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree. Devin beat him with pure rotation. He just went like, yeah, I'm not going to get stuck out here trying to push. He just rotated him straight over. And Hermes, with the amount of back pressure that he has, and we all know how strong his wrist is, it really is back wrist flexion. And that's how you beat the presser, really. And he's obviously strong enough to do it. Did you see the 92 kilo?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 92 to the back pressure.
SPEAKER_03: is like unless he is going to lift jerry's elbow up from the pad this is these things are good for the explosiveness but you pull that way the guy puts you and then you stop one more moment then then it goes to the endurance instead of just one time he needs to do this and then finish this quick if he's gonna do but it is it may come to a point that how long
SPEAKER_03: you can hold the guy here and you know we just talk like you know everything is on the paper like a computer game but you know you both know that they put the strap and then when you feel the power
SPEAKER_03: It is not about what you are capable of doing. It's more about how strong you are to apply what you are capable of doing. Ability is something. Applying enough power to counter is different. So this is the beauty of arm wrestling. They put the strap ready and then we don't know right now what they will apply.
SPEAKER_03: and what they will feel you know maybe one will bring some some strength to the table that the other will not be able to handle you know like hermes is incredible top roller he pulled against levan
SPEAKER_03: he he couldn't take his wrist his wrist was taken so of course he continued this way but this was not his game plan you know but the conditions forced him to do end up in in that position so and I saw I saw a uh photo uh not that I saw but Jerry sent me a photo this morning the guy is just
SPEAKER_03: looking something different and different i don't know if i should show this or what you know the guy is just like he's a monster yeah he doesn't look normal he looks like way way way way yeah
SPEAKER_03: he's just gonna make sure he's coming there very seriously i don't think that he has ever taken any match more serious than this one and sometimes it is the competition difficulty level is the one that like making you force your limits you know so hermes is such an opponent let's see let's see how it will be anyway so we have been
SPEAKER_03: more than one hour with mike and about an hour with lachlan thank you very much for being my guest and it will be big honor to host you guys in istanbul and before we yeah i thank you guys for accepting the offer uh do you guys have anything to say before we finish to each other or to the spectators or whatever thank you to you i mean yeah i'm just i'm just excited to uh
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm just having a bit of an opportunity. So thank you, Anger. We'll put on a war for you. Anyone who is coming here deserves to be here. No need to thank. You deserve it. And hope to see you guys. Hope to see you guys. And thanks to everyone who watch us. And just can't wait. Three weeks. This is what is today. Wednesday. Even less than three weeks, 20 days, we will see Lachlan here. And then exactly three weeks later, I will be picking up at the airport, Mike.
