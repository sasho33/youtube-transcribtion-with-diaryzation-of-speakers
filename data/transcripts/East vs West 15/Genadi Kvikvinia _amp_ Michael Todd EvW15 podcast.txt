SPEAKER_03: hello lars how are you hello andrew i'm fine thanks and you good good good i i see that you guys are training i'm i'm happy to see you guys yeah it's a lot of fun man a lot of fun he he's motivated me i look around i see how ripped he is i'm like i gotta work out harder yeah yeah yeah he works harder than me for the important things for all those things i'm here to learn yeah yeah anyway so
SPEAKER_03: uh what to do about the gennady he's he's online david but yeah maybe we'll wait for five minutes if you want to come like contact us i will turn off the meeting and i will try to call okay okay however however you say um how is everything michael
SPEAKER_01: Good, man. Good. I'm actually, I'm feeling better. You know, I had the diverticulitis and it kind of, it didn't necessarily make me weak, but I had to do 10 days of antibiotics. So I lost like 10, 12 pounds. And then I actually found out I've got GERD, which is like a gastrointestinal reflux disease thing. So I got medication yesterday for that. So within about a week, I should be able to start eating again, like more food. So, but my strength is good. Like I'm still strong. So that's good.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah yeah and and you will have uh another three weeks and yeah yeah i mean so we uh and we leave we leave we're heading over on on the 26th we're going over for a couple days and we'll be to you on the uh seventh eighth night so we'll be you by the 29th you know because
SPEAKER_01: I want to get to Europe earlier this time so that I could acclimate and get the, so I don't have any jet lag. Because normally we come over like on a Wednesday or Thursday and then compete on Saturday. So I want to get to Europe at least sooner this time so that hopefully I don't have any jet lag or anything. Yeah, I got time. I'm just light right now. So like my evening weight is like 290, where it was over 300. Okay, when was this? 300?
SPEAKER_01: Uh, two weeks ago, three weeks ago. I mean, every day for like, every day for like 10 days. How old are you now? 290. 290. Yeah. You will be over 300 again if you want it, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I feel good though. Like I really do. I feel good at this weight. So I'm probably the same weight now that I left here when I went to go pull Camille.
SPEAKER_01: Um, so when I get back, I mean, like once I, once I'm over this medication and I can start eating, like, it's funny, cuz Lars was like, cuz he was eating so much more food than me, but I can't eat large portions right now. I gotta eat smaller portions. So in about a week, I'll be able to start upping my intake. And I think, uh, I think I'll probably be, I figure I'll weigh in right around 300 is what I'm thinking. Yeah. And, and, and how about you Lars? You, you, you look, you look, uh, lighter when you are around Michael.
SPEAKER_03: Last time you guys were the same weight. You guys pulled 115 or 105? What was it? 115, right? 115. And what are you now, Lars? I think I'm approximately the same. 115 and Michael is 132. And how are you doing, David?
SPEAKER_00: You're training, David? I have a great hard training. Hard. I think harder than the early. I have no idea why, but I think so at the time I will take more pleasure from the training. I think so I will be... I plan to compete in the WAF.
SPEAKER_00: First of all, I will compete in the Georgia national championship because I didn't compete there for five years. So I have no idea what is my level to the connecting athletes to compete in the WAF. So I will take part in the Georgia national championships and after that... So next year you're going to compete in nationals, Europeans and Worlds? Yeah. First of all, I must do
SPEAKER_00: win the Georgia national championships too. But that's the goal right now. This is the goal because like it was the goal because like to be true like I don't have the gold medal and I'm not champion European champion and I'm not the world champion so I always knew that I will be back there
SPEAKER_03: to take it to try to take them and win this so i will just check now maybe david maybe like gennady is online on messenger i'm calling him he's not answering i send him the link he doesn't check maybe maybe maybe you go and come back maybe you reach him out because i will turn off uh and i will yeah yeah yeah yeah let's go yeah
SPEAKER_03: Michael, how do you like the gauntlet? Oh, my God. That's amazing. Yeah. Is that going to be for every weight class? We haven't decided right now. I'm going to do it for the overall right arm, overall left arm, you know. And then, yeah, this is not going to be like the legacy hammer, but this is only for the East versus West. It's not like, you know, whatever, 150 years or something. But this is going to be golden coated, you know, real gold coated. And yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, real gold-coated? No, outside. How do you say that? Wow, that's great. How do you call it? Coating you call? Yeah, I mean, 24... I mean, like gold-coated, I guess. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, gold-coated. I thought it was just... Yeah, that's expensive. That's nice. That is expensive. I think it's going to cost me around $5,000. Oh, my God. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But it is worth, you know, armless...
SPEAKER_01: listen that's awesome you know me i love trophies but i mean so think about that if it's for the overall right and overall left
SPEAKER_03: You know how hard it's going to be to get your hands on that thing? Baba, I will tell you something. This is not going to be like you win it and then you take it home forever. No, I know. Yeah. Baba, we should still put something like somehow. If you defend like 12 times, because it's like very, very obvious. Well, time of the princess, yeah. Whenever I say 12 times, who comes to your mind, you know? For me, like directly, that was some shit, you know?
SPEAKER_01: He already won nine of them. Yeah, that's amazing. Morozov won four left-arm titles. So we're going to make it not impossible, but very near impossible. Right. Just think about it. The right hand. Obviously, I want to eventually be able to beat LeBron. That's my goal. But we all understand how big of a goal that is. Almost impossible of a goal that is, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's exciting. It just gives you that little bit extra motivation, you know what I mean? Is it still exciting if you just think that somehow it's very, very hard for it to be yours permanently, but still to put it on and then pause it after you deserve it? Is it still exciting? Of course. Okay, that's good.
SPEAKER_01: i mean listen if you if a person can beat levon everything about that day is going to be exciting i think this is more important than anything else yeah you're right right yeah but but it would be even better memory to pause with that thing you know with the gun of course yeah of course yeah yeah i mean so so we have jerry jerry's getting a shot pretty soon um yeah that's pretty that's pretty exciting i mean because you know so listen jerry jerry
SPEAKER_01: He has a full-time job, and he's taking this match more serious than anything he's ever done. So we're going to see the best Jerry that we've ever seen. Okay. What was your honest opinion?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I think Levan's going to kill him. Oh, you think Levan is going to kill him? I mean, listen, I don't think you can go toward Levan. I think you have to match him outside and then come toward him. I don't think you can just go toward him. So you are saying that first, you need to do like what Hermes did. Of course. And then stop him and then dive in. Because if you remember round three, Hermes stopped him.
SPEAKER_01: And then he died. And then there was a foul. And then second start, Hermes was like, oh, let me do this directly. And then whenever he did, he got flushed. Exactly. Exactly. But Jerry is not the same. Jerry is not the same. But you got to figure by round three, LeBron already had a little fatigue on his arm. You're talking about the strongest person who probably has ever arm wrestled from this position. And you're trying to come toward him. It's very dangerous. Now, the thing is, Jerry will do it.
SPEAKER_01: And he will go 100 miles. He'll go as far as he can go that direction. So we don't know what's going to happen. Logic tells me that's not the lane. But it might be the lane. You know what I mean? Who told you? Logic. My brain. Logic says that's not the lane. But I mean, we don't know until someone tries it, I guess. You know, someone tries it who is the expert at that move. And Jerry is an expert. A question to you. Do you think LeJuan is going to prepare and pull
SPEAKER_01: as always or you think he will do adjustment just for this opponent in my opinion he doesn't need to do anything different if he just pulls like he always does he'll still win but if he tries it like if he pulls in the way armies did right that's the perfect lane that's the perfect way to do it but i think lavon's style is still the perfect way because he doesn't really come way out he just he's so tight and just goes sideways because he's so strong
SPEAKER_01: Um, I don't know, man, it's, it's exciting to see because you know, what if, what if Jerry pulled it off? I mean, what if Jerry pulled it off?
SPEAKER_01: And then if I can beat Gennady and then I could beat Hermes, then it could be me and Jerry. You know what I mean? Oh, yeah. And we know that's a crazy match. You know what I'm saying? That goes forever, you know? Yeah, and it has a big story behind. Especially if it's seven rounds, you know what I'm saying? Like, you have to win four matches. A me and Jerry match could take the whole day. You know what I'm saying? I could start in the morning, end at night, you know? Yeah. Phil Woody says that Monster Michael Toth set a new world record.
SPEAKER_03: Pro Nation champion, he says.
SPEAKER_01: I beat my own personal record yesterday and I actually just beat it again today. In the way I'm doing it, I think it's the heaviest anyone's ever done. Pablo has the world record on the same lift. It's just a little bit different angle. I'm not going to claim a world record until I surpass Pablo's number. It's exciting to see me make progression, continue to progress. I'm happy that I'm
SPEAKER_03: I've had a few obstacles in this camp that I've had to overcome, and I'm still strong, and I'm still stronger than I was at my last match. So that's exciting. Yeah. In my opinion, Michael, like anyone who, you know, this side, like the ulna side of your hand and forearm, is to block the opponent's arm, supination.
SPEAKER_03: And then this side is the pronation. Anyone who is over pronating against Jerry, and if Jerry is in a very good shape, that person is in trouble. Of course. Yeah, that person is in trouble. And so I'm just thinking right now, like Jerry beats Alex Kurdeca. Wow. Yeah, convincingly. Yeah. And I'm just thinking that even like,
SPEAKER_03: if somehow like Jerry pushes here, the bottom hand of Levan, and Levan just gets over pronated, not because he wanted, but just because he couldn't handle the pressure here. And then because Levan is pronation dominant puller. So if it ends up somehow here, that may be a problem. So I'm just thinking that we have seen
SPEAKER_03: like John pulling such way, like in an over pronated way and still beating Jerry in the breast. And so my question is like, is Jerry today stronger than those times or, or because like John,
SPEAKER_03: I'm not saying that, like I have seen John Beedon with this side, you know, by using, how did they call it, Mohegan Sun or something, it was just an event, you know. Yeah, yeah, 2007, 2007 Mohegan Sun. Yeah, 2007, with those blue shirts on them.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but he also beat him with, like, a totally overpronated position, and Jerry is all over his arm. So is it because, like, I don't think that that was the best of John. I think, like, I would say the best of John was 2006 Vegas, but... Oh, my God, was he strong that day. Yes, yeah. Yeah, but one thing, it's a big difference when John has a shorter arm. I know for myself when I'm pressing, when I have a shorter arm,
SPEAKER_03: It's harder. Levon have a longer arm, right? Yeah. John and Levon is just like maybe two inches far. I think John is, I think, 6'2", when he was younger, you understand? He was 6'2", yeah. He's probably 6'4". Yeah, he was 6'2", and Levon is, I think, 6'4". And like, yeah, there's this, but John is not a guy...
SPEAKER_03: like just because he was like middleweight to lightweight like his hand palm everything he was just like a super heavyweight guy you know he was not like really short it's not like my forearm or something you know
SPEAKER_03: And that's why, one of the reasons that he was very effective against such bigger guys. So what do you think about this? Well, your question was, do we think Jerry's stronger now? Yeah. And I think Jerry that's going to show up to pull LeBron, because he's taken this match so seriously, will be the strongest Jerry we've ever seen. But how about when he beat Alex Kurdecha? The reason I'm asking that, because Alex Kurdecha is one of the top players of today. And Jerry also beat...
SPEAKER_03: Gyorgy Svetko, he also overpronated and Gennady tried to beat him with outside. He also ended up, you know, losing. So my question is that like, is it because like, I mean, John to beat Jerry, I understand, especially in best shape, but I think John has winning records against Jerry, as far as I know, I'm not sure, but so,
SPEAKER_03: Like, how is it that John was able to do that, but today's super heavyweights weren't able to? And I think John was around like maybe 210 pounds or something. Today's super heavyweights is like a Gurdjieff or a particular Svekov.
SPEAKER_01: spec call has no transitional press that's why you and I think my match with spec off would be a very good matchup because it'd be hard for him to finish me without a press right um so he doesn't have the ability to transition behind it like if any like if I had Jerry in the positions that spec off had Jerry in I could transition behind it and press him so could John back off doesn't have that in his Arsenal and then if you're talking about Alex tradition
SPEAKER_03: that match never stopped long enough for kardec to do anything you know what i'm saying kardec was just out of position and got beat like if the match would have stopped in an over pronated top i understand but i understand but if you cannot even stop him it means that you are not even strong enough to stop the guy you understand to do something so he was even level below
SPEAKER_01: than a guy that who would actually stop him you know so good agree to but I mean it's also look at the height of Alex connection like he couldn't even get in the spot where he needed to be to defend like he thought he was in a spot and his arm was just boom going straight down and I don't think it was because he was necessarily weaker I just think it was a disadvantage and leverage and inexperienced and pulling Jerry like anyone who like that's the one thing Levon is might have a problem with he's never pulled anybody like Jerry
SPEAKER_01: because there's there's jerry there's camille and there's lars who have been pressers right like and there used to be the one dude from slovakia was it slovakia who was a presser from back in the day that was a pretty good presser you mean you mean peter gazaricha yeah he's still pulling in masters category he had a good press like he had a good press right yeah um but there's there's very few people to press like jerry presses so if you've never pulled jerry
SPEAKER_01: There's an inexperience that you got to figure that out pretty quick. Now, I do think LeVon's strong enough to just negate everything. Regardless of the experience, regardless of everything, I think LeVon's just that strong. I personally believe, and this is what I believe, is LeVon probably has the strongest hand and wrist that we've ever seen in the sport.
SPEAKER_01: But my belief is the only way to beat him is to beat his hand and wrist. Like, I think you have to go through his fingers, get his knuckle past his wrist and put him in a bond in the strap. Like Devin and I both believe it's an open top roll that stops you. Then you have to, once you stop him, then you have to be able to deal with this bit where his press is coming or whatever else is coming, right?
SPEAKER_01: But there's a whole lot to defeating LeVon in my mind. And I don't think it's a single lane where you come toward him. Like I said, Jerry might shock the world. He might, I mean, anything's possible. Anything's possible. So I can't put, I can't say he can't do it. I'm just saying if I'm betting, I got to bet on LeVon, right?
SPEAKER_03: But I don't know. OK. One guy says that there is no way John has a good chance against any top 10 Super Railway today. Well, today's John doesn't. Today's John doesn't. No, no, no. But the John from back then. No, no. He probably says the best of John.
SPEAKER_03: doesn't have a chance today that's just because people who don't understand yeah you and i have been around them we've been here for a long time we've seen what john was capable of yeah michael michael yeah that that is the part that you know like every time we try to tell and then the new guys or just guys at the four or five years into the sport they they they kind of don't understand you know like what that man was you know just especially the vegas shape wow okay i was about to talk about that so you and i saw
SPEAKER_01: the strongest read ever. Yeah. And then you saw John crack his wrist back and run over it and then go, Hey, I'm going to test out his hook. Yeah. Who does that?
SPEAKER_03: no one else does that no one else in the world is like this guy may be the strongest inside guy on the planet right now and i'm going to try to beat him in the hook you know what i mean like you know maybe some guys may try that if it was a super match best of five and he's already trio and then let me try on the round four but this guy but you know that's not the only time john did this kind of thing john very very often you know he tried it and he didn't even care if he would lose or not
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. He's just one of those dudes. But that's what I'm saying. So that John on that day, that John on that day, over a six-round or let's say a seven-round, four wins, that John, does he have a chance against today's LeBron? I think so.
SPEAKER_01: Possibly, but... LeBron's still the favorite, but that John's got a shot, especially over... He's got to pin John four times. Like, that's a...
SPEAKER_01: people don't realize how strong that John was right yeah and they were yeah John will tell you when he was younger he may not have the top end strength but he was better like more explosive than everything like so yeah who knows John Brzezinski's just special like there's just there's only gonna be one John Brzezinski like this guy he told me one time that like I have never lost against Cleveland every time they pulled he said he has won against Cleveland and when he beat Cleveland
SPEAKER_03: he was probably 210 pounder or something, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like that. Can you imagine that today, a 210 pound guy beating prime Cleveland? Come on.
SPEAKER_01: right no i mean because for once but john just figured out he's like listen this hand is too big to mess with i'm just going to grab him with his wrist and turn him in a hook yeah but he was doing it so easily and he was just going it was nothing like his ability to just supinate that massive long ridiculous arm and insanely large hand and just put him in a hook was like who like even when gary even when gary beat cleave in in 96 he was holding it holding holding his thumb you know i mean in 94 one match he beat him at the yukon
SPEAKER_03: in the 96 yeah he he kind of dominated him but he went through his hand like he went through his hand like yeah john would always just grab him low and boom
SPEAKER_03: Even Gary, as good as Gary was, he had to go outside. He couldn't grab him like John. John was just different. The part that people don't understand when we talk about John, there are some things we see, but you cannot really prove because it is not like math or something. You understand? It's not like magic. Right. Which is people don't understand the difference being well-rounded
SPEAKER_03: and the smoothness in the technique application. The transitions, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it doesn't have to be transition, but even the application of each technique, the guy was so smooth. Like, you just look at the bird is flying, you don't see the bird is trying to fly, right? Yeah. He's flying. He's just flying. He's making it look easy. Yeah. And whenever you see John, like, the way he was arm wrestling, like, I cannot...
SPEAKER_03: 34 years I have been involved. I haven't seen anything like that. I have seen Prudnik, I have seen Ongarbe, Devon, you know, like very good arm masters. But that smoothness, the quality and the application of the technique, you know, just like even today, the way that he did that, he's 60 years old.
SPEAKER_03: the way that he did transition from here against yeah you just give him you just make a little bit mistake you just give him a little hole he's gonna make it larger just you need to dominate him you're not gonna beat him
SPEAKER_01: Like, if he finds a mistake or if the power is almost equal, you know? Yeah, he's definitely not the guy you leave in the match. Like, you want to get him out of there quick. Because if you leave him in the match, and the thing is, it's different. You can leave him in the match, and if he's not hungry, he may lose. But if you have a hungry John Brzezinski like you had at East vs. West 14 with a crowd behind him, that's when you see something special. Because that's what we saw was something special.
SPEAKER_03: And even John's like, I probably would have done that had it not been in North America and hadn't had this crowd streaming for me, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. There is one guy, Levan's English teacher. He says, Levan has pulled Gennady. Jerry won't be the new to him. No. Gennady is not Deadrest's specialist. Just because he beat Levan with Deadrest, you cannot really compare Gennady and Jerry. Jerry is different. Jerry
SPEAKER_03: non-stop 30 years at the world level he pulled against all kind of different pullers like jerry is deadless shoulder pressure specialist kennedy is not kennedy is kennedy is doing everything eight and a half nine out of ten but nothing ten while jerry is doing this ten right yeah so i don't think we can compare what do you think what do you think lars
SPEAKER_01: I think, as you saw, it's totally new for him to someone getting in from start like like Jerry do. So I think it's very hard to see what will happen. It is. It is. Yeah, for sure. And like you said, so this is another example of people who see something once and now they make an assessment that, OK, Lavon has the best bent wrist press in the world. No, Devin cracking.
SPEAKER_01: and devil is fully committed to an open top role and lavon's like okay i'm gonna press
SPEAKER_01: The amount of pressure he had to use to press Devin may have been half the amount of pressure that Jerry has to press or something, right? Because Devin was fully extended. Like it wasn't, Devin had no protection to defend whatsoever. Like he was here. So it was going to be a lot easier to press Devin there than if Devin was somewhere over here. But they see that and they're like, oh my God, LeVon's got the best press in the world. I know he made a very good move round one to get out of that, you know, to finish that round and then came back and dominate the next three rounds.
SPEAKER_01: But he did show versatility. He did show that there was more to LeBron than just, you know, this amazing hand and back pressure and pronation. But just because he bent wrist press through Devin's open top row does not mean he has the best press in the world. You know, it just means that he had a very good move at that time. Yeah, but Devin, to get that hand and wrist position, he had to
SPEAKER_01: be extended in if it was in this angle he would get probably yeah he wouldn't he wouldn't have made the stop if he would have stayed here he would have got to stop yeah yeah yeah he had to go a little bit more farther and farther you know and the thing about that is when he made that stop i think there was a brief moment in devin's mind where he's like holy i stopped the match and at that moment he wasn't thinking about what to do he kind of shocked himself and in that moment of shock
SPEAKER_01: Levan changes angles and presses, you know, because we're all going to be like, I mean, everybody who pulls Levan wants to stop him. But you really don't know if you can. And when you do, you're like, oh, shit, I just stopped him. You know what I mean? Like, I think that's kind of a little bit of what happened around one is we were all shocked. Yeah, yeah. I thought the time stopped. I was like, is this real? You know? 100%. Yeah. Were you there that day?
SPEAKER_03: I was, yeah. You were there, right? Yeah, yeah. I pulled Frank a little bit before that. You were watching. And you saw that. What did you think? Did you think Devin's going to win? Yeah, yeah, I did. I thought yes, because the round won. I suspect, actually I suspect, and I told before that Levan had prepared the press. And he had. But Levan did the timing very good. He did exactly, exactly in the right time, you know, yeah. Levan, Levan.
SPEAKER_01: people think that he is big and strong but he is also well dude he came he came from 198 pounds like he's been arm wrestling yeah so and that's what you see technical arm wrestling lavon never had to show technical arm wrestling really because he's so damn strong like you don't have to see how good of an arm wrestler lavon is because he's so strong he rarely has to show technique because he's or versatility and technique because he's so strong
SPEAKER_01: So people who think, oh, you just got to stop the match and beat him, well, no. You got to stop the match. That's the first thing. Then you got to be able to out-arm wrestling. I mean, there's a lot of variables that goes into beating LeBron. It's more than just stopping the strongest arm wrestler. You have to be able to out-arm wrestling because he is a very good arm wrestler as well. He just doesn't have to show it because he's so many levels stronger than everybody. Yeah. Michael, I don't know what is wrong with Gennady. I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: He didn't check the message. He didn't look. I don't know. I hope everything is OK with him. But yeah, me too. Me too. We'll keep it. We could always do this again. We can do it again. No big deal. Yeah, he's just he's just he was just saying that. Oh, Michael, don't be afraid. Come and face me in the podcast and this. And now now he's not. He's not. We know that's not it. That's not it. Gennady is not afraid. He just probably something came up. Yeah, you need you need to you need to. I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: You're always trying to stir shit up. Yeah, that's what it is, you know, yeah. We cannot say this. Give the pot, make the things exciting and just, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so the one thing when you and I last talked, you talked about this card of nine world title matches and everything, but how excited you are about me and Gennady. I think me and Gennady are going to be one hell of a match. Yes, just tell me which match you want to see. You are only allowed to see one match. That would be you versus Gennady.
SPEAKER_03: Because I know that match is going to be a war for sure. And I don't know who's going to win. The second match I would like to see would be Matushenko versus Ali Can. I don't know where the match is going to go. No idea. We may even be quick or not. But still, I cannot give guarantee there will be a war. Right. But I give guarantee that your match with Gennady will be a war.
SPEAKER_01: Well, and the reason being is I don't think I'm going to be strong enough to run over him, and I don't think he's going to be strong enough to run over me. So we're going to get into a fight. It's going to stop, and it's going to be who wants it most, in my opinion. Now, I would like to say that I'm going to be strong enough to run him over, but I can't say that. I think we're both going to be very strong on that day, and I think we're both going to want to win really bad, and I think you're going to find two guys who are willing to die at the table. You know what I mean? And I think it's going to be a good match. I'm excited.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yeah. I am starting to worry about it. No, I'm hoping everything's okay. Like this is unusual. Yeah, I don't know. You're right. Yeah, that was always says it like, it doesn't make sense that him to join the show without getting out here. And yeah, let's let's let's continue. This way. Yeah. Um, I talked with Hermes.
SPEAKER_03: I said, Hermes, do you want to directly pull Levan? He said, no. He said, neither Michael nor Gennady has any chance to beat me.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, this one is all. And then he I went to there. You call that, you know, starting shit. It's not just need to that. That is how we are going to give the information to the community. And I asked again. And again, did you see the interview? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There was some more. There was some more. I cut it.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, really? Yeah. I didn't want some people to be offended. Yeah. Right. And yeah. And but I don't know if I cut it the part that he said that Hermes was like a kid looking for his parents or something. Did you see that part? He said something. And I don't know if it's in the video because I was doing something else while I was watching it. But I heard I heard a reference to that. I don't know if it's in that video or what. I know one thing that he said that he said that when Hermes pulled against Devon.
SPEAKER_03: And I look at the stage to Hermes and Hermes look at me like he was asking help from me, you understand? And he said that he looked like someone that lost the parents and looking for it, you understand? And yeah, and Hermes watched it. He said that, you know, it was funny. Hermes, it was funny. But the big, big matches are waiting for us.
SPEAKER_03: Like you versus Gennady, winner takes the Hermes, and then Jerry versus Levon, and then winner of the Hermes match will go. Right, right. Okay, so let's just say that is how it goes. Let's say I beat Gennady, and then I pull Hermes, and I beat Hermes, and Levon beats Jerry. When would the me versus Levon match, or when would that match happen, the winner of Hermes? Spring. Spring. Like May, May, May, or end of April.
SPEAKER_03: wow yeah okay in istanbul or in us uh we will say but most likely us
SPEAKER_01: my goodness yeah well then it can't be armies it has to be me it has to be me you know why why not because it's in the u.s it has to be me i have to know what we can do we do here yes versus west i'm just saying you're making it sound too good you're making it sound too good i've got to i understand yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so what we'll do is i'll get to talk to people here in hot springs we'll make it happen right here in hot springs
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. It would be a big disadvantage for Levan. It would be a really good advantage for me. Then you can sell 5,000 tickets. We could sell so many tickets. The entire state of Arkansas would be behind me. I think the most tickets would be sold in the Northeast.
SPEAKER_01: My belief. Well, I mean, I think I think honestly, from a fan perspective, what we have, what I do have different here in Arkansas is we have we have college sports, but we have no professional sports. And I could get on all the radio stations and all the different things here in the state of Arkansas. And if this if this was how things fell.
SPEAKER_01: i think we would draw a non-arm wrestling fan base to come watch this 52 year old arkansan uh compete against the unbeatable the russian i mean the georgian giant you know what i mean like the georgian i think there would be a massive amount of uh of tickets sold from a non-arm wrestling fan base people who just want to come see the spectacle there's talk on that one more quick of this it's stuck to magnet to the post reaching there's chalk
SPEAKER_01: Right in front of my, where I do the quotation gauge back pressure. Rebecca's back training. She's starting her CrossFit training again, so I'm excited to see that. Oh, okay. Okay, that's good. That's good. Yeah, yeah. So on that note, though, I don't know if anyone knows this, but I'm undefeated against Italians. Against what? Against Italians. I've never lost a super match against anyone I've arm wrestled in Italy or who is Italian. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_03: But not against Georgians, right? No, no, my Georgian record sucks. My Georgian record sucks. I don't have a good record. Okay, because so let's not drive the things that way. Yeah, well, okay, I guess you're right. I guess you're right. Okay, yeah. You stole my joy for a second. I was just, I was trying to poke and dig at armies, you know. I need to do it. I need to, we can't have a boring conversation. Yeah. And last, what are you thinking about all this?
SPEAKER_02: he said what do you think about all this i think it's great what's happening is great uh no no matter who it will be it's starting to build up like crazy you know people talking about it everywhere me and michael was talking about it back in norway you know like ordinary people knows michael and devon and uh it's
SPEAKER_01: really blowing up so he said arm wrestlers I mean just exposure just in Norway alone if you know anything about strength you know the top arm wrestling people yeah like you already you know if you if you follow strength at all it's already everyone knows it I mean a lot of this you know him being recognized in Norway and being in the papers and all that stuff so then people started following you know the other arm wrestlers and stuff so that's pretty awesome yeah I'm super excited about your partnership Robert Baxter though Michael what do you think about Robert Baxter like for me like
SPEAKER_03: It is not because I am saying this because we are doing partner thing, but I am doing partnership with him because I'm thinking this way. Do you understand? I cannot imagine anyone who is better than Robert Baxter. For this particular endeavor?
SPEAKER_03: absolutely not yeah yeah and this guy this guy is a very i don't know how he's very busy like about business and everything yes this guy still trains like crazy and make sure that he goes to wap and and and competes he's you know you know masters world champion and everything right and so i i'm just thinking that like
SPEAKER_03: Like he, at least I know that he loves arm wrestling at least as much as I do. Yeah, yeah. The guy, I mean, I've known Robert
SPEAKER_01: probably for over 20 years yeah and we even the first time we competed against each other was 2008 in salt lake city in 242 class um but yeah i mean just as soon as you messaged you know remember you made the and we we knew when you made the post that you had already this is already so but i mean i couldn't help it the moment you you've said hey you wrote me you wrote me yeah i mean because that's the person who immediately came to my mind you're like
SPEAKER_01: who loves arm wrestling who's successful in business I'm like that's Robert Baxter that's the guy you know I mean that's who you had to go yeah yeah do you know do you know do you know everyone in the community especially in North America do you know anyone who doesn't like Robert Baxter I don't think you could ever find anyone say anything negative about Robert no no way because he's such a genuinely good guy yeah like he's genuinely a good guy yeah he's an honest person he's he you know
SPEAKER_03: He's got a lot of faith. He's just a good dude, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, somebody is asking if Oleg Zok will pull East vs. West 15. Yes, my friend, he's going to pull Bet Kili Oniani. Michael, this is a crazy card. Crazy, crazy card. You know, like we have nine world title matches, and look at the non-world title matches. Right. They're not a quick win, you know, Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_03: Di Zerano versus Vitaly Laletin, Ozan Kocak versus Nugo. We have Irina Glatkaya versus Berita. And I'm forgetting one and I need to find it.
SPEAKER_03: I don't want to be... Whenever you organize so many matches, you... I know, but this might be... Everybody's saying... Pretty much everyone's saying this is the best card yet. And it is. It's a crazy-ass card. Like, this is... Michael, whenever I start organizing so many matches, some people were telling me, oh, you're organizing too many matches. Soon we will be running out of matches. And I said... There's no such thing. You just need to bring more people
SPEAKER_03: And then you need to give more chances so people will see new stars. And then by the results of the matches, you will already have, if you circle all arm wrestling worlds around five, six guys, of course you will run out of matches. That time you will run out of matches. But if you give chances to everyone who are rising stars,
SPEAKER_01: And then you let them be known by the community. And then, of course, when you have the pool so big, how are you going to run out of matches? Listen, you could keep me busy for a long time. That's just me. Like, there's a ton of matches that I could have. I mean, regardless of, I mean, think about it. So let's just say I beat Gennady and I beat Armys and I get a shot at Levant. There's still a whole bunch of people in that top 10 that I've never faced.
SPEAKER_03: Look at Vitaly Laletin. Vitaly Laletin versus Dzoranov match, the winner also deserves to pull. 100%. That's a crazy-ass match. Listen, Dzoranov is a freak.
SPEAKER_03: Bad guy. You were surprised that when you saw him against Rivas, you were like, wow. When he beat Rivas, I was like, what the hell? Because Rivas was huge. Huge, 170 kilos. And round one, I was thinking that first two rounds, Rivas is going to flat spin him. And then maybe he tires. But round one at the center, he hooked him. You guys were there, right? You guys were there. Yeah, we were pulling, yeah. Yeah, yeah. And I was like, what the... Yeah, and now...
SPEAKER_03: He's going to be even in better shape and we know that it is getting better. I asked, do you have any like goal to pull Levan again? He said, I leave for that day.
SPEAKER_03: You know he does. I love that. You know he does. Yeah. That is my goal to make sure that everyone is having opportunity to reach their goals. At least have opportunity. They can be successful or not. This is up to them, you know. Yeah. But you need to give them the opportunity. They shouldn't be left around that, okay, we don't have any future. We don't have any opportunity. Let me quit arm wrestling, you know.
SPEAKER_03: unlikely we are bringing some of the old legends you know back to the uh support did you see the video that about the guests at the east versus west 15. no i haven't oh do you want me to tell you the guests yes please arsene liliev awesome hermes gasparini arthur morozo and who knows maybe arthur morozo who knows you know what i mean
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and possibly, big possibility, Kirill Sarche. And the last one, Denis Tsiplenko.
SPEAKER_03: awesome awesome yeah because i actually have i have a uh oh crap are we gonna have a bunch of trouble between devin and dennis i don't know i don't know i will make sure i will make sure there will not be any trouble but yeah i will make sure like nobody wants trouble yeah right everyone needs to respect the place that they are visiting you you know they will you know they will but yes yes yeah i'm just saying you know just let me say it so because it's it's never gonna be good we all are civilized people you know yeah
SPEAKER_03: right and yeah and we will see we will see how it will be and how do you see your chance against ghana let's talk a little bit directly and then let me get some information to steer the pot when you guys both come to the show next time i will just say you remember
SPEAKER_01: so i i saw him saying 50 50 because we're friends but then the fans later set us up in reality 99.1 or something i don't know what he said i honestly think this is you put down a lot of texture tests on my past 100 i think i'm a sick i think 60 40 is me i think i have a six i think i have a greater chance of winning than he does that's what i believe although the last time he beat me and he beat me three to zero
SPEAKER_01: I don't think that's how it's going to go this time. I truly think I'm going to win. That's just my 60-40 me. I don't think it's 70-30. I don't think it's 80-20. I think it's 60-40. If you give me 50-50, if it's a legit 50-50, I immediately think I'm going to win because if I'm in the match, he's just going to have to want it more than me. As much as of a warrior he is,
SPEAKER_03: On that day, he's going to come up short. That's what I think. Yeah. My opinion, you have advantage because you both had very serious injury, but you had three matches to build your confidence and get used to the atmosphere again. This will be his coming back match. I don't know where his confidence, but whenever I talk with him,
SPEAKER_03: he seems confident he was surprisingly very confident you know i i had this interview i'll say the private conversation right yeah private conversation and we will see we will see i'm telling you on the paper looks like you are more ready than him and but we will see where it will go but it is incredible match i i can't
SPEAKER_03: I can pay $20 just to watch that match, personally. If somebody was organizing that match, I would pay $20. They said, you need to, you're going to watch this match, $20. I would even pay a little bit more just for that match. I know it will not be like this. I know it will not be. I don't think so. It will be a big chess game. And the interesting thing is that whenever Devon and Gennady was pulling, and then I all the time was telling Gennady, but just Gennady, you are not a flash spinner.
SPEAKER_03: And you know the endurance of the, you know, Devon. And then he said, one second, one second. When did you see me losing, you know, like in a long battle, you know, like the balance match, you know. And I was like, eh, not as much as Devon's, you know. But he didn't guess out against Devon. No, he did not. He did not. And then now, I don't know if your hand and wrist control will be as dominant as Devon's.
SPEAKER_03: But your defense is, like, you are there all the time. You know what to do here. You handle the pressure. Or Jerry, like, how many minutes? A long time. Seven minutes, yeah. That's the thing is, you know, he's going to have to, in my opinion, he's going to have to overwhelm me. Like, he's going to have to be a level stronger. How about just you guys are balanced and then he's,
SPEAKER_01: if his hand is stronger and he puts you into the like the first match there is no way for them yeah i don't i i i go i went back and watched that match and i saw the errors that i made right and that was me not trying to walk with him me not maybe is it was it related to power is it a mistake it could have been it could have been a lot it could have been a lot of things um yeah
SPEAKER_01: But I had, you know, that was back when I still had nerve damage and I was I was coming back from some different type of injuries at the time. I don't think I still have those issues. I think my I mean, I'm doing riser lifts every day better than so just on my riser lift alone. And it's a little bit different than traditional riser, but it's a riser that I can judge where I was at. So when I went in to pull Camille, I was at 121 pounds.
SPEAKER_01: Today, I did 131. So I did 10 pounds heavier on the exact same lift. When I went in to pull Camille, I did a 179 and a quarter pronation lift.
SPEAKER_01: Today I did a 182 and a half. So, and I still have, I'm going to keep doing that lift every day for the next 20 days. You know what I mean? So I honestly think by the time I think I'm going to hit over 190 pronation, which is very, regardless of, regardless of how I'm doing. Can I ask you something? Like, like we don't see like your pronator is just being like pronated this way.
SPEAKER_03: isn't it like more about the arm than the like do you think this is more about the pronation or the arm strength to stop him because I see that many times when you guys do this you guys are stretching you know a lot here I'm stretching a lot there because that's where my strength lies you know because I only recently had this range of motion all of them are all of them everyone is like I don't see anyone doing this with
SPEAKER_03: 90 degree you know no i mean because for one the weight gets so heavy it's almost impossible to do and still keep it 90 right yeah but what is it the key like the pronation your arm to not to turn is the key or what is the key or is it that because he's not gonna really control you like this i i don't remember when did somebody hook you last time right away
SPEAKER_01: It's been a while. It's been a while since someone did that. But that's the thing. For me, it builds confidence. It builds confidence. And it's translatable, right? Because so much of what we do, and you know this, when you compete at this high of a level, there's a very significant amount of this that's mental.
SPEAKER_01: yes you have to believe right so doing these lifts that i know translate to how i arm muscle i continually make these improvements daily i know that that that is a very good form you know so the pronation is important to me but the riser of keeping the integrity of this which i i wasn't i lost this quite a bit now it's getting back to where it's strong and i didn't so people talk about the frank match um
SPEAKER_01: In the Frank match, I wasn't doing any of this stuff. And I made some technical errors from my original game plan because of the emotion of the moment. I got caught up in the emotion and I completely threw my game plan out the window. It was the first match, right? The first match. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: um now i mean like after your injury your first comeback yeah i mean i had pulled pablo here which really was a legit match we both prepared for it and everything yeah but the atmosphere is kind of different over here it is definitely a lot different because we did that right here with like a few people watching versus yeah you know a whole crowd watching especially that day because that was lebanon versus devon that was a huge crowd biggest crowd we've ever had
SPEAKER_01: So the emotion, everything that was involved with that was a little bit different. But yeah, after that, like in preparation for my martial arts is when I started doing, actually, no, I hadn't even started doing that yet is after you is when I started doing the daily pronation lifts and the riser lifts and all those other things. And like my pronation engaged back pressure that people don't really understand that movement until you come here and try it. I did a 250 before I put 250 pounds pronation engaged back pressure like this.
SPEAKER_01: before I pulled, Camille, I am programmed to at least hit a 275. So that's a 10% increase from my previous strength. I don't know, man. I think all these things together are gonna create a very confident me on the day. I think I'm healthy. I think, and that's one thing, like you said, we both have had a similar surgery.
SPEAKER_01: You don't have to. You go cold in and do a maximum lift. Your arm would break. So he's like, do you warm up? I'm like, nope. I just go out there and grab 180 pounds and lift it with one hand, you know. And normally you would think you would have to warm up to do something like that. But my arm is just healthy and it feels good. So I think going into Gennady in this match, I do think, you know, I've had more time to recover and heal and be stronger. This is his first match back. This should be a big test for him.
SPEAKER_01: It's exciting that this match determines, because the winner pulls, think about that. Put that in perspective. Now, obviously, you know this. But according to you, I am two victories away from pulling for the overall number one in the world in the gauntlet. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, but just remember, the victory from when you are ranked from,
SPEAKER_03: 20 to 10 the victories and then when you are walking from number five to the top it's just like getting like harder because there is a reason that they are ranked so high you know of course there are so this is not an easy task but i mean yeah like whenever you say like two you know just like no no it's two really really really really strong people yeah and honestly you and i both know this that most likely i will pull ganadi on november 2nd and then i will have another opponent december 16th that came to table north america
SPEAKER_03: have no idea who that might be you know what i mean so that's in between the first of february with the match of army you know what i'm saying we don't really know listen i will tell you something in my opinion if if there is only one and a half months and if the end of january event is also gonna be in uh us i think you should just stick with that if it is in u.s
SPEAKER_03: Right. So you said end of January or 1st of February? Because you text me 1st of February. No, no, no. But it is like, just say like it is last week over to January and the first week over to, like, it is just not even worth it. I know. I'm just mentioning, you know, yeah. Remember, I told you I got a wedding in January. So like January 11th, I got a wedding. When? January 11th?
SPEAKER_03: it's 11th so it's two weeks before no no i still mentally have to have that that time that extra week will help me get back into prep okay you are saying that like it better be in the early february it would be better for me yeah yeah but what i just tried to say that like if that is american event then i think that we should choose you for
SPEAKER_01: enemies match i mean and i i i understand the belief i i mean because it's you know and that's just like this one like you offered me you offered me more as all last weekend you offered me about that like six weeks ago but i i did not feel like i could give gannati a full camp
SPEAKER_03: and then me have a match in between. Similar situation with Hermes. But I will tell you something. Hermes match, if you pass Gennady, Hermes match, it will be more important. Right now, like just say that your chance is 25% to reach to Levan match. And then whenever you go next one now, 50-50, you have one opponent only. You understand? So I think it will be more. Just I would, as an organizer, I would choose you versus
SPEAKER_03: But when you pull someone like Gennady, if I would pull Gennady, I would be more worried about here, about him, than here. Of course, this is also important, but the guy can really reach his maximum capacity because of being mentally so strong. The last thing I want to hear is Opana. Don't let me hear that shit at all. If I can keep him tame, if you can keep Gennady tame,
SPEAKER_01: Your chances of winning are way better. But the moment you give him that bit of confidence and he gets that victory and he's screaming, that's not the Gennady you want to arm us. We got to keep that shit down. I don't want any of that, you know? So, yeah, I mean, that's where it's got to be. It's got to be in a way where I defeat him, not just physically. I need to defeat him mentally as well.
SPEAKER_03: yeah i i love talking arm wrestling with you we both are from the same generation we know what has been true and then yeah and you you love our messing as well yeah it's great so it's um rajan devangan mike do you think kennedy's side pressure jerks that he does when the match stops will be a problem how are you going to be prepared for that particular attack
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so he's very explosive once the match stops. Like, he can still hit those sideways hits real hard. We're going to release my review of him versus Jerry. I just did that the other day, and I watched a lot of that. And his ability to surge sideways and get a pin on Jerry after the match has stopped was very impressive. And he was doing it to me, and he was doing it in some of his other matches that I just recently watched. So, yeah, it's definitely something you have to be concerned about. But I feel if I can control his hand and wrist,
SPEAKER_03: in the start, I don't think he can do those hits sideways without hand and wrist control. I think if I can take his hand and wrist out of the game, he won't have access to those hard side pressure surges in the middle of the match. That's what I think. Yeah. We will see. We will see. I think the guy is just, he has just went over the problem. Also another problem with Gennady, you should be ready for many things.
SPEAKER_03: Not like one thing. When you pull Jerry... You know what's coming. Yeah, 100%, very powerful. But whenever you pull Gennady... You never know. You never know. With you, it can be totally in, totally out. But we also saw some outer side pressure when you pull Lars.
SPEAKER_03: a little bit yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you you saw that but we cannot say that it is your main weapon i think your main weapon is mostly outside and sometimes you you act like you're gonna go there and boom and if the man stops boom out again you know yeah my ability to go in and out is
SPEAKER_03: probably the best in the world yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah whenever you hit whenever you hit inside the guy even stops his hand is not like because he gets so much pressure here the hand gets a little bit out and your brain is so strong and you do this
SPEAKER_03: transition so fast boom and then the guy is shocked because even he stops he had some hit there right there and then suddenly boom out and then you know i i don't remember you hitting inside and not being able to hit outside you know i i don't remember okay so in my last time i pulled ganadi i went in and he went straight sideways before i could get back out and he flashed at me so it has happened
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right. But did you kind of stay there? Might have been, I don't know. I think you just stayed there. I went in and it ended up that way. And I was like, well, that sucks. I didn't like that. Yeah, I didn't like that. Yeah. But yeah. All right, yeah. OK, let's talk quickly about the cart. OK. Yeah, and then we can, yeah, one second.
SPEAKER_03: okay let's go um brigitta versus irina gladkaya do you know brigitta from hungary yeah i know her um
SPEAKER_01: and i know she's accomplished but i would i see so much arena on her social media post training so i feel like she's going to be the favorite because she's still she has not stopped training it doesn't look like i don't know how much she competes but it doesn't look like you know yeah yeah yeah i think that you see her training videos recently not all the time but you know i've been seeing her training on instagram she's always posted she's been posting something on instagram for like the last two years yeah
SPEAKER_03: yeah doing something always you see yeah she's always doing something and what do you think what do you think arena okay yeah and azad versus daniel ustinov azad is from armenia and daniel ustinov is from kazakhstan one is 154 world champion other one is 165 world champion daniel is the one that who replaced hunter okay yeah yeah yeah so that dude looks crazy
SPEAKER_01: like daniel daniel yeah his arms look insane yeah yeah yeah so i don't know who's gonna win yeah it looks crazy so yeah if you just go by aesthetics i go with daniel i'm like he looks crazy um but that other the other dude the other guy was the 154 which one's the 165 world champ daniel daniel daniel yeah i gotta go with the bigger guy then i gotta go with him and you lost
SPEAKER_03: i'm not sure but the only one i've seen and seen the one i've seen most of is daniel so he's so active on social media and he is very well known yeah yeah okay let's go do you know ozan kocak the one who's born nugo yeah no ozan kocak has wins against jordan soner
SPEAKER_03: He's not the guy from Turkey, is he? Yes, he is. Yeah. That dude's awesome. I trained him. He was at Zloty and kicked a lot of people's ass at Zloty, right? Oh, you were there? Yes, yes. Yeah, that dude's good. This guy has beaten... He beat Martial, didn't he? Did he beat Martial? Yeah, that dude's good. But he was only 189, you know? I know. What's he weigh now? Right now...
SPEAKER_03: 2.35. Yeah, I'd go with him. Nugo's awesome. Nugo's awesome. But I'd go with that guy. That dude's strong. Yeah, he's real strong. What do you think? I'm not sure. I've seen him, but I'm... Yeah. Nugo is impressive. Nugo is impressive. He's very strong. My God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know who's going to win because last time Ozan competed was 2022 WAP. End of the 22. How did he do? Huh? How did he do? Did he win?
SPEAKER_03: No, he was going to go semi-final match but he injured his shoulder and then he didn't pull the semi-final match. But right now he has been training for five months and I don't know where he is at. So this match can go either way. Artur Makaro vs. Omer Farukh Kozakoğlu. Omer Farukh Kozakoğlu, he won the 80 kilo waft.
SPEAKER_03: against nur dalit but nur dalit actually pinned him but he lost on fouls is that the guy who has the same size hand and wrist like like yeah or like that's exciting arthur is also the same way same thing yeah yeah and i don't know where he's gonna i think arthur i mean more experience yeah yeah he's been around a while now i have seen him taking some losses in that amc stuff
SPEAKER_03: Like, he lost a couple matches over there. Yeah, he lost to Cercaso. Yeah, yeah. That category is weird. Cercaso lost to Mindaugas. Mindaugas beat Daniel. Daniel beat Alain Zole. Alain Zole beat Artur. Like, everyone beat each other, you know. Yeah, that's crazy. That's crazy. Yeah, I still think Artur. Okay, okay. And Dimitri Petrova versus Carolina Pettersson.
SPEAKER_01: so carolina is awesome yeah yeah she's awesome yeah but watching demetria trina turn uh tanaka in a hook like that yeah that was strong like once she sunk her hook it was over
SPEAKER_03: But Carolina's really good, man. That's what it is. You know, it's going to go out. Yeah, Carolina's really good at hanging out there in that pronated top row. Like, she's good. Dimitri actually beat Carolina in 2023 World Final in 60 kilos. How'd the match go? Was it fast? Not really. She went inside, and then Carolina wasn't, like, caught on pronated. Like, she had the pronated, but Dimitri was a little bit dragged. Here's what I think. And then, look. 3-2 Carolina.
SPEAKER_03: three two Carolina okay he loses the first two comes back because she hangs she hangs her up at that top yeah okay the question is real question why do they not pull the last round I didn't think it was six rounds no it's world title match 60 kilo oh okay thank you I forgot okay uh four to three then three it comes back and wins four yeah and you lost
SPEAKER_01: uh i go with tolan carolina as well yeah it's his neighbor huh neighbor yeah neighbor that's that's it that's it yeah i just i think it could be nasty i think she could catch i think she could i think she might get turned in but she flops her wrists enough times that in the strap he he hangs her up and then ends up wearing her out and stretching her bicep out that's what i think this is
SPEAKER_01: Carolina, yeah. She got mad endurance. I'm impressed with her. Like, we've known her for 20 years, right? She's been doing this a long-ass time. But she got a lot of endurance. Yeah, yeah. I just got a bad look from Rebecca. I said I was impressed with her. I take it back. I'm no longer impressed. I got a bad look from my wife. I take all that back. Okay, let's go. Oleg Zok versus Beth Kiloniani. Listen, Beth Kiloniani is a bad dude. You saw him against Artem Taino, right? Holy shit. Like...
SPEAKER_03: I don't know, he might flash Oli every single time. But if he doesn't, Oli is going to win. But I think he could flash him every time. Is Oli healthy again? You know, listen, BetKitty is not a flash spinner person. He positions... Well, he did. He smacked the shit out of Tejanovic at least once. No, he stopped him and he caught him and then...
SPEAKER_03: beat him but not really the way he can sink a hook though like if you sink a hook on oling you just you just you just negated this whole massive hand that he has but it's really hard to do that like it's hard and bad kid is very tall guy you know he's like 16. yeah and then he's his mind it's all real right yeah what do you guys think he's winning i don't know much about all i hope so i was doing though is he well or he just won the world championships
SPEAKER_01: and well what do you want the world championships at a lighter weight like yeah 85 kilos 85 kilos yeah yeah right now he still holds the belt 85 kilo belt he's going for the second belt yeah so he's going for the 95 kg 95 kilo belt yeah becky lee becky lee i love ollie i love ollie but becky lee's a bad beat the way he beat tan out i didn't think you could beat tan out like that
SPEAKER_01: I didn't think there was anybody at 209 pounds that would beat Tano like that. He looked like he was completely different levels. I was like, what the hell just happened, you know? Okay, Michael. Now, you are the best person, maybe together with John Brzee, to, you know, predict about this match. You tell me which match. I'm so confused. What matches are on the card? Touchings versus Yoshinobu Kanai.
SPEAKER_01: OK, so if Yoshi is healthy, like if Yoshi's back to the Yoshi to beat John Brzenk several times, it's going to be one hell of a fight because Yoshi has a lot of endurance as well. Do you agree that I'm cutting you? Do you agree that Yoshi is the type of person that if you don't really dominate him, if he just has
SPEAKER_03: little bit even pronator here. And Tata Shins is not the type of person that has the full control. Tata also goes like this. So I'm just saying that if the power is very close, we will see something that I think we will never forget. Because Yoshinobi like this has even pulled six and a half minute match.
SPEAKER_01: and do you agree that like if the power is closing maybe a better moment if the power is close we're looking for a dog fight like just like you said something that the modern arm wrestling world will have never seen a match like this because they don't realize who he is but if he's not back to that form todd hutchins runs him over okay yeah because right now todd hutchins is
SPEAKER_01: Like, and he's so strong. People think his side pressure, like his side pressure is insane, but it's his back pressure that he applies with his side pressure that makes him so dangerous now. When he pulled Angerbaev, Angerbaev was trying to come out of the side and he pins himself because Todd's side pressure, back pressure is so strong. Like you try to come out of it and you just open your own arm up. Now, Yoshi, Yoshi, I don't think we'll have ever pulled anyone like Todd because Todd's pressure is different.
SPEAKER_01: Todd's pressure is different. But you're right. If the power level is similar, it's who the hell knows, right? But if it's not, Todd Hutchins runs him over. Do you know about Yoshinova, Lars? Yeah, of course, of course. I remember him very well. He's amazing. But I think Todd is too strong. I think it would be hard for him to come back
SPEAKER_03: at that high level, but I don't know how, I don't know if he'd post anything. I haven't seen anything of him. I heard that he has been training very well. There is one guy is the number one in Japan. And they told me that he beats him pretty easily. Even when I, do you know how this happened? I have been reaching him like through someone like sending him message.
SPEAKER_03: from there and he says that no no no no and suddenly he reached out me through someone oh okay that is ready that is right he said I'm ready so I believe that he trained trained trained and he's do you know what he offered he offered people against Devon Larratt oh okay yeah he's ready yeah and I said I know Yoshino you are very very strong but this is your first match
SPEAKER_03: And do you want me to set someone else? He said, no, I want Devon. I said, Devon is going to put Petrenko. He said, I will wait. You understand? And then I said, okay. And then I just tried my chance. How about Carcassings, you know? And he said, not bad, you know, let's go. And then I set the match, you know, that way, yeah. So is it 105? Is it 105 weight? 105, yeah. 105, yeah. I remember the best thing I remember from Yoshi was his ability to...
SPEAKER_03: get in some crazy positions and still right he can pull this way yeah he can pull this way he's just like he's just like solid guy you know just like really strong guy you know in if you didn't pin him if he has a little bit pronator the guy
SPEAKER_03: You need very strong shoulder pressure or something. I don't know. I still go with Todd, but if he reach out and tell you that he's ready, so... Yeah, let's see. Okay, another one. While we're talking about someone needs to press, can I? And when I'm talking about press, what's the next message? Press, press, press.
SPEAKER_01: Come on. I can't even think of the card right now. You got me so... Reno versus... Oh, by Sagov, yeah. Abraham Sagov, yeah. So now it makes sense to hear the press, press, press? Well, that's also that heavyweight world title, right? So that's a... Yes, it's heavyweight world title, yeah. Man, I'm impressed with Reno. Reno's versatile. Like, he can do a lot.
SPEAKER_03: segoff has a ridiculously strong press do you think that reno has like he can pull in different ways but do you think that we know that his main move is the press but do you think that his secondary style outside would be good enough to beat
SPEAKER_03: the primary style of Ibrahim Sagok. You saw, Sanderis tried to go out, he couldn't. Chance showed. It is very, very hard to get Chance in. And, you know, whenever you go in like this, and then he just usually beats people. But he actually turned him in and
SPEAKER_03: Preston, so I don't think that any of these guys will be able to go outside. I think the match is going to go inside, but I don't know who's going to win. Wow, it's incredible. This one's 50-50 for me. Yeah. And you, Michael, what do you say? I'm going for Reno. I think Reno's going to pull it out.
SPEAKER_01: Which style? Inside? Outside? I think he might end up just outlasting him inside. I think he just might dogfight this thing out, you know. Okay. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Do welterweight gold. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, this is a rematch, right? This is a rematch? Yes, against Vladimir Mairov. Listen, I'm telling you. Vladimir was insane. We talked about the matches. I'm getting already so excited, you know. Do you also get excited when you have your own match that does not excite you? Or you have so much to do with your own problem?
SPEAKER_01: then these like so all the matches i'm i'm a fan and want to watch what i try to do now is not get too invested where i get to adrenaline before my match yes because i don't want to have i don't want to waste all my adrenaline getting excited you're probably not going to watch right at that time you're not going to watch that time right you are not going to watch the matches
SPEAKER_01: I'll probably have to watch them. Yeah. I'll probably, I'll just try to sit there and stay calm. Right. Just sit there and stay calm because I mean, I'm still a fan, like just like you, I'm still a fan of arm wrestling and I want to see the outcomes. So the problem, the biggest thing will be to sit there, watch the match. And control your adrenaline. Of course, which is going to be difficult. That's what I'm saying. Like when Corey and I were on the same card and I was up there working his corner,
SPEAKER_01: that destroyed me for my match like i already had this all this adrenaline dump and then i'm like oh you know so i'm talking about in orlando no no no oh you're talking about this versus five was it it was whenever i lost to anger by it i think it was five yeah yeah so what do you think about samusha versus vladimir myro so listen you cannot bet against samusha because he does the impossible every time but do you think that he will do that forever
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. But I think Vladimir has the biggest chance of anyone yet because this will be his second shot and he damn near got him the first time. Yeah, yeah. He was just coming back too, right? Do you agree that, like my opinion, anyone who needs to, like who wants to beat Samusha needs to really totally dominate his pronator? Yeah. You take his wrist here, pronator is still pressing you like this. You need to really cut this
SPEAKER_03: connection here. Absolutely. And this guy, Vladimir Mirov is an incredible wrist flexor. Did you see him against Adam Orzenski? Oh, my God. Yeah, he really controlled him. Oh, my God. How bad was that? Like, that was horrible. And Adam's strong. Adam is very strong. This is what I am saying. So, somebody who wants to beat Samusha really needs to control. Top row, he takes his wrist. He will beat you sometimes even easier than he beats you in hook.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, because whenever you overpronate, you are actually missing here and pressure over his pronate. If you are going like this, and then his shoulder, backside of his shoulder is so strong that he even beat Sasho with the address. How crazy was that? That was so crazy, you know what I'm saying?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, you took Sasha, who is an inside puller, and he had to go outside because he couldn't. I mean, it's just crazy. I'm telling you, it's hard to bet against Samusha, but Vladimir almost did it the first time, and he was fresh off the couch, it seemed like, and now he's had some time back. Vladimir has a very good shot.
SPEAKER_03: And Lars? Samusha. I think they will pull it off this time as well. There is another thing about Samusha that every match, trust me, I see him, he's getting stronger. He looks stronger. If you tell me any best of you could beat Samusha a year ago or one and a half years ago, I say, yeah. Now, how are you going to finish him? You know, just...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, like you said, you got to be able to turn him up. Yeah, yeah. And then when you do top roll, it is even harder. Let's go to the next one. Vitaly Laletin and Deserano. Last five matches. No, I'm not going to talk about the last four matches. You want to say Vitaly. You want to say Vitaly.
SPEAKER_01: OK, but Zorinov is such a unknown because he looks like he just keeps getting stronger. So I have no idea. Like, I can't even I can't even make a prediction because logic tells you Vitaly because he's on the ascendant. And that's a lot of people want to see him pull Levan. You know, we want to see that rematch.
SPEAKER_01: uh might be the dark horse yeah he might be the dude like he might he might beat us all who knows because they're like I don't know that guy's crazy this much to see yeah yeah yeah that that course you said right right yeah he's the guy it's one of the most exciting matches I think because we don't know yeah yeah I mean dude he top rode reverse like he didn't just beat him he top rode him
SPEAKER_03: I mean, holy shit. Just think this way. Think this way. He beat Ivan Matushenko at WAF right and left at 110 kilo category. Yeah. And when you saw it in real life, close up,
SPEAKER_03: was a scary dude dude he was so thick his hands his wrist is throwing off so thick he's i'm telling you the guy like a cinder block or back he doesn't even move you feel like it's like it's like a cinder block wall like this moving like the thing yeah yeah yeah it's yeah he's solid and the way that he talks and everything you know he's just like i mean like
SPEAKER_03: V8 engine, you know, you know, yeah, it is a sound of high level something, you know, but okay. Irakli Zerakashvili, Giorgi Tautier. So do you know Tautier? That dude's amazing. Yeah. He's a giant with crazy. Remember when he beat Dimitri Trubin, like the last couple of years? Yeah. Do you know how tall he is?
SPEAKER_01: six seven he he's only one and a half inch shorter than yeah yeah so six seven and a half six seven yeah yeah yeah giant giant you know what i'm saying like yeah and and so thin and singing we like a kevin vongard with this crazy top roll but i still think correctly i still think iraqis man iraq impresses me a lot like i mean i know he lost the data can i know he lost
SPEAKER_01: The Dada Khan loss was crazy because I had no idea that Dada Khan was going to be like that. But Irakli looks like he keeps progressing. I mean, he trains the best arm wrestlers in the world, right? So I still think Irakli. And I think that the winner of this match should pull a 95-kilo world title against Patashins. Ooh. Ooh, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, listen, I think Todd Hutchins is a 95 kg guy. I think he's the champion. Yeah, yeah. He's pulling. What weight is Todd? What weight is Todd on your shape? 105. 105, yeah, yeah. I think 95, Todd's a champ. Okay, like we already have all the adrenaline out, even by talking. But now you have Ivan Matushenko versus Alizhan Murado. Bro, that's insane. Alizhan, listen.
SPEAKER_01: i've never seen anyone do what he did to like uh prudnik and adam is and army that was like how do you do that because they're so good like their level is so hot he made them look like they didn't even belong on the table so and as much as i love modashiko if he can't pin him quickly
SPEAKER_03: I see no path for him to win. Yeah, but just say that he couldn't beat quickly, but he caught him right here. And then Alizan is here, you know. And he keeps him out there long enough. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But the moment Alizan gets this one and then looks at him, oh, God. In the center, he has more chances.
SPEAKER_03: Alijan, I always say that Alijan, very fast, but Alijan is fast in more like body moving this way, while Macheng is the wrist, you know, he goes like, and he really dominates somebody's pronation, so you cannot really hit him.
SPEAKER_03: You saw his match against Morozov, how he put him to the losing position. If the elbow pads were like same as the East vs. West pad, the score would be closer. So are they switching that? Is the Kiela table going to switch to the East vs. West table? Yes, it needs to. It has to. Like if you're having world titles on the line at both, they have to have the same table. We got to have the same elbow pads. The reason that we've made that thing, you know, because the elbows, we don't want the matches all over the place. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You remember, I decided that after Jerry versus Gennady match. Of course. Elbows were all over the place. And I said from now on, elbow from each side, one something bigger. But any, anything gets out, directly we call foul. Anything from back, side, front. Lars, how do you see this match? I'm hoping for Modošenko.
SPEAKER_01: But I'm not sure. It's hard to say. It's hard to say. But I'm rooting for Marushanko Procho. He's a cool guy. Yeah. He is a good dude. Yeah, he's a good dude. So that's the thing about Alizon. He is so respectful. Every time I see him, they're so happy to see me and stuff. He's super nice. But that dude is... At the table? Yeah. He is so... Even though his forms and everything looks big, when you see him in person, he doesn't look that intimidating.
SPEAKER_01: until you look at his arms yeah yeah it's just the face and everything just no and he's his frame isn't that big like he doesn't have a really big frame so when you see him you're like yeah and then he grabs a hold of you it's like holy what is this forearm the left arm left left forearm it looks like a
SPEAKER_02: superhero like character you know from the like get out of from the comics don't you think even if he dominates a lot of people what he do is going straight into maruschenko's good line as well
SPEAKER_03: Well, that's what he's saying is that Matushenko's ability to snap here and get down fast. I don't think he's going Matushenko's best lane. I think what is best for Matushenko, if somebody tries to top roll, boom, and then you are like this. Unless it's Vitaly. Because Matushenko can't hook Vitaly, can he?
SPEAKER_03: But when they pull super matches, I think first two rounds with right arm, Matushenko hook him and beat him. Yeah, and the next week he gets thrown out. And Vitaly gets much bigger. And I think he's right now 20 kilo heavier. The thing is, I think Alizan...
SPEAKER_03: might like if alizon wins this he needs to be pulling for the overall world title because he might be the guy no he will not pull him the italian morals will pull i know that but i'm just saying after that yeah yeah yeah yeah if he beats what a shinko there's a good chance he will have the next one yeah and imagine if he wins that three world titles
SPEAKER_03: and actively told all of them yeah if he held all world titles yeah yeah yeah he will be like left on jumbo zinc you know you know not about the quality but the pound for pound effectiveness absolutely yeah yeah let's go to the last one uh david and patrick that one and not not prudnik but petrenko petrenko yeah yeah yeah um
SPEAKER_01: you got to pick Devin as a favorite especially now okay so you probably have the same inside information that I have Devin has to lose a lot of weight yeah he is heavy yeah this is gonna be a big cut for him yeah the fact that he's put back on so much weight was great I don't know if I can say on here I'll tell you after okay it's a lot like it's it's a whole lot um
SPEAKER_01: But how do you pick against Devin? Okay, so think about this. And I know you and I both, you know, we've talked about a 105 Devin is not the super heavyweight Devin. We know this. Yeah. But in your mind, when Devin was going after LeBron, did you ever see him doing to armies what he did to armies?
SPEAKER_03: I thought that there was a possibility him to stop him or something, but not right away. Oh, my God. So if that Devin is the same Devin that shows up. That's. No, no, no, no. It's more than that. It was 73. But yeah, if that's the Devin that shows up. It cannot be the same Devin. I don't think one of them. I'm just saying in his hand and wrist, in his hand and wrist. Even the hand and wrist needs to be supported with the.
SPEAKER_01: Your hand and wrist may be strong, but if your arm is not strong, it is just going to stay there. Here's my prediction. The only way Petrinko can win is if he goes right through him four times. If the match stops and Devin puts any kind of bleed on him, the tied turn, Devin wins.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, that is the general scenario that always happens. We all know, right? Yeah, yeah. Something happens. But outside of that, if we're saying we don't know how strong Devin actually is or how strong he's going to be at this lighter weight, although he'll make 105, he'll rebound to 115 probably. You know what I'm saying? Like the day of competition, he's going to be way heavier. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: yeah without what I remember he was very good at dropping and back up and still be strong yeah so if you still have that ability I think that one for sure yeah I mean you gotta pick Devin I mean I love Petrinko like I have a huge respect for him and and you know because he's Pushkar student and we love Pushkar's wife we love we have so much respect for that whole camp you know I mean Andre Pushkar will always have a special place in my heart right um yeah so
SPEAKER_03: Love Petrinko. Love what he did with Dottie Cant. Love what he did. Obviously, what he did with Dottie Cant hurt me because it kept me from winning a world title. So, damn it. But I will tell you something. Just think this way. Think this way. If Devon goes down to 105 and if he pulls Taka Shins, would you accept an easy match? But I think that would be an easy match? Yeah, if both are 105.
SPEAKER_03: No. No. But I will just say this. Daddy can beat Tata Sings. And Daddy can beat Tata Sings in hook. And he brought him down. Tata took him here. Tata catch him and bring him here. And Daddy can stop him and still beat him. What I'm just saying is Tata also has very good injuries when the match is stopped and he gets his position.
SPEAKER_03: And Dadikyan kind of, I cannot say exhausted him, but his endurance also was there and he was stronger. And this Petrenko destroyed him. Yeah, I mean, he beat him. He beat Dadikyan. So round one, it looks like Dadikyan is going to kill him.
SPEAKER_01: Because we never went over this yeah yeah and then all of a sudden for trinkle just puts on this turbocharger or something and runs him over you're like holy crap how to do that so yeah I mean it's if that is that is an accurate, if you can, if you can go Todd lost Dottie can Dottie can loss of drink coffee. Not really not not really. But i'm just saying. It may not be.
SPEAKER_03: like that far like also like on Garber like if one of five Devon pulls one of five on Garber I wouldn't expect an easy match like it would be but but they they wouldn't well I wouldn't expect an easy match but I would expect a 3-0 match 3-0 match that you say that he would or 4-0 I think Devon would win 4-0 but it would be difficult he would exhaust him he'd wear him out he fatigued him he'd go multiple places um so you think though I think the on Garber cannot do those
SPEAKER_03: Because Ongarbe technically is very good. The reason he couldn't do against Todd because Todd never stopped the pressure. But sometimes he brought him here, still couldn't finish him because yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And against Petrenko, he really couldn't do anything, you know. No. But apparently he had a wrist surgery or something after that or something. After that. I don't know if it was wrist. Yeah, I think wrist or elbow. It was something. I don't remember. But, yeah, man, Petrenko's the 105 champ for a reason. You know, he's a bad, bad dude. But I would have to say, and this is just, I'd say 60-40 Devin.
SPEAKER_03: It could be 70-30 Devon. I don't know. But I think you got to pick Devon. You will be surprised if Petrenko wins. That's basically what you're saying. Well, not, I mean, surprised? Not necessarily. If he beats Devon, like pins Devon four times, four rounds, you will be surprised. I would be surprised if he pins him four times. Yeah, you would just say, wow, I wasn't expecting this. I mean, he's very, very strong. And to win, he needs to dominate.
SPEAKER_03: That's the only way to win. That's the only way. He might be strong enough to dominate. He might be. That is the only way. That is the only. But the another thing that when sometimes, especially the last round or something, the match stopped with Dadikyan. The Dadikyan that whose endurance was good enough against Takashi and whose endurance is good. Patenko still won that round when the match stopped. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so any message for Gennady before we finish? This is exactly one and a half hour. What can I say to Gennady? Well, I hope everything's okay. I hope nothing bad happened is why you missed this. Look forward to getting back here on a podcast with him and let's have a little back and forth. But only message is do not look past me. Do not underestimate me. This is a different Michael Todd than you faced last time.
SPEAKER_03: better not underestimate you because i think that your form right now is very good your form is very good if he underestimates you especially in his current condition when he's coming back it would be a mistake he's very very confident guy but i think he will be taking you very seriously yeah
SPEAKER_03: I think he needs to, I think so. This man, he sleeps, he trains, he eats, he sleeps, he tracks, he watches armwrestling videos. I'm saying, I see how he lives. Yeah, he's living... It's warm poker. You can see the fire in his eyes. Yeah, that is why the conversation took one and a half hours because I asked the guys, you know, like some of the guys I invited here, I said, who's going to win? Devon.
SPEAKER_03: Next question. Who's going to win? There is no even opinion. There is nothing, you know, just like opinions there, but no details, nothing, you know.
SPEAKER_01: And while Michael is just breaking down every detail and this and that. He has so much knowledge. Yeah, knowledge, and he loves it. He loves it. He likes to talk. Well, we all do, man. Look how much of our life, you and I especially, look how much of our life we have dedicated to this craft. You know what I mean? And I'm not talking just years. Think of the years, but how much of those years was taken up thinking about arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_03: think of your life the last 34 years how much have you thought about arm wrestling in 34 years and you're 50 years old so 34 years how much have you thought about wrestling you know say like i mean especially the early career i think there was nothing even if when i was in u.s if i had to wash a glass i was watching like this yeah i know i know so it's so funny and i'm so thankful so on that note i know we gotta get off here
SPEAKER_01: But what you've done with East versus West
SPEAKER_01: And, you know, obviously what Don's doing, king of the table, but bringing in, you know, Robert Baxter and the potential right now. Like you and I have been around a long time. We've seen, we've hoped arm wrestling is going to go and then it comes and it goes and it comes. Right now, like you said, we are very close to becoming mainstream. Like we are on the cusp. And yes, it's going to benefit us. Yes, it's going to benefit, but the future generations of arm wrestling may have a career where they can truly just be professional athletes.
SPEAKER_03: have you ever have you ever seen arm wrestling gets close to there have you ever seen have you ever seen anything like what you saw at the east versus west 12 and east versus west 14. have you ever seen a crowd in arm wrestling like that have you ever seen i have never seen of course not of course and this these are paid attendance yes they are not there to compete and while they are they are watching they these guys travel
SPEAKER_01: Think about this for a second. These are two different things. Obviously, North America, East versus West 14, Orlando, it's a place, it's a destination that people would bring their family, they would come to whatever. Obviously, that's gonna have great attendance.
SPEAKER_01: but your event in Istanbul, Turkey, and no offense, people probably don't vacation to Istanbul a whole lot from here. The amount of people who came to you to watch that event and paid, not just the ticket price, but the airfare, the people who did VIPs, their whole trips, that was a vacation to Maldives. Michael, I can tell you that 98% of the Orlando spectators
SPEAKER_03: were from North America. Right. And East versus West 12, I can say more than half came from all around the world. Exactly. But I'm telling you, it was incredible. One of the reasons that the atmosphere in the US was better than anywhere else, when the competition is happening in Istanbul, people say it's in the East. No, it is in Turkey. And there is maybe one competitor at that level or two maximum till now.
SPEAKER_03: So, but in North America, more than half of the competitors were from there. So those crowd was supporting their guy, their guy. But when I was in Istanbul, people comes from all around the world and athletes, Americans says that it is East, but trust me, all those athletes are coming from different countries as well. They don't have their own spectators there.
SPEAKER_03: Right. No, they don't. Yeah. That is why in America, the event was just most likely North America versus the world or U.S. versus the world. And there was a lot of patriotic feelings involved. Of course there was. What I heard and what I saw. So that is incredible. And as you said, we have never been
SPEAKER_01: this close no dude like the fact that you have a thousand person paid attendance to watch arm wrestling and it wasn't like just watching arm wrestling for a couple hours we're watching arm wrestling for like six hours you know like this is this has never existed before but those people will never forget that experience no absolutely not so i mean like this is the the sport of arm wrestling the community everyone owes you a huge
SPEAKER_01: Thank you and gratitude for everything. But at the end of the day, it's because you love... Rebecca has so much fun watching you at the press conferences when they do the face-offs because you always have this huge smile on your face because you're always so excited. You know what I mean? Because you're just as invested as a fan because you want to... The reason these matches are so good is because you want to see the matches too. You're like, this will be a great match. I want to see who wins. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: that's exciting and that's what I and I'm doing that during very tiring weekend like every hour every day three four hours sleep you run there and you have so much stress financial stress production stress and a lot of stress but I am still there and and trying to enjoy I wish like I didn't have that stress and I will be just like sit there
