SPEAKER_00: Will it be more comfortable to speak Russian or English? Well, I understand, I understand. You understand, right? I understand English, but I also understand Russian. Okay, as long as it's more comfortable, I won't have a problem speaking. Okay, Indian asks if you want to be big in this competition with the UN. I want to be strong. Strong, yes.
SPEAKER_00: Last time, my friend, I just asked if he's planning to gain weight or not. I don't know. Like, can you ask him that?
SPEAKER_00: Oleg said that nothing particular, like nothing special about gaining weight. Maybe 87-88 kg is the most that he will be at competition. Oh, so he's planning to gain some weight? Yes, some weight.
SPEAKER_02: OK. Is it possible, like, Betkili to put camera somewhere because it's so much all time moving? Betkili, like on a table or something because it's so much moving. Is it better now? I think he turned off his camera.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I can see him, but I cannot hear the voice. Sorry, not camera, the microphone I meant. Sorry. Oleg, can you turn your camera sideways? Yeah. Okay. It's okay? Yeah, it's okay. Yeah. Can you... Okay, Bedkiri needs to turn his microphone on.
SPEAKER_02: Oleg, you defeated Betkili before, two and a half years ago. And it was East versus West too, but it was not easy. So how do you see your chance this time?
SPEAKER_00: Engin says that two and a half years ago you beat Betkili, but it wasn't easy, it wasn't an easy victory. And what do you think will happen in this match? What percentage do you have? Well, I think that 60 to 40 in the direction of Betkili. In the direction of Betkili? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: That's true. So, Engin, Oleg is telling us that 60-40 towards Betkili. So, he thinks that Betkili is the favorite in the match. Okay, why is that? Why are you saying that? Because of that weight? 95 or what?
SPEAKER_04: Well, I'm 85, he's 95. I'm very happy that he took the belt from Tainov and it will be a good fight. But I play underdog.
SPEAKER_00: so like um he says that like because of the weight that uh that kill is going to be 95 on competition day and he's going to be at most maybe 85 86 that's why he thinks that uh like the favorite is going to bet killy it's the same time he mentioned the time of match he's happy that like bet killy won the china match and like he's entering this competition like the underdog
SPEAKER_02: okay so because he is already champion in 85 so he's trying to another category like alejan is doing uh yeah and betkili uh so but can you ask oleg like can can he not
SPEAKER_02: As Engin says, it was your first match after the war with Betkili, right?
SPEAKER_00: And how do you think, are you stronger now than before?
SPEAKER_04: Well, I'm training. I understand that it will be difficult for me. I went through a difficult return after an accident, after an accident. And now I'm trying to do as much as possible to make a good fight. But still, I think I'm an underdog. And it will be difficult for me, because it's a higher category. And since we haven't found rivals in the category, I will fight in 95.
SPEAKER_00: you're absolutely right like oleg said that it was the first match after that car accident
SPEAKER_00: Oleg says that his preparation since the time of course continued, he feels strong and he thinks that he hopes that he will be stronger in this competition than it was before. Okay, now let's go to Betkili. So I will translate these things to Betkili. Okay, go ahead. Yeah, go ahead.
SPEAKER_00: So he hopes, Betkely hopes that as strong as Oleg shows up, it will be better.
SPEAKER_02: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And how does, like, Beth Kille, we know, always a tall guy, skinny guy, and very strong. Now we finally see a muscular Beth Kille. Like, how strong is he compared to his first match with Oleg? And how strong is he compared to his match against Artem Taino?
SPEAKER_00: Well, Betkili, I would like to ask you this question. When Adreo came to Soplios and other organizations, he was a great man, he was a great man for human rights, and now, according to your version, he is a very strong man and a very strong person. What do you think is the difference between him and the others, and what is the difference between you and the other versions?
SPEAKER_01: So he says that on Europeans and World Championships when he was participating into these competitions
SPEAKER_00: He was 75 to 80. This was his maximum weight, you know. But this time he gained at least 15 kilograms, at least 15 kilograms. And of course, he feels much stronger and better shape than he was compared to the older self. And of course, compared to the time of match, he feels a bit stronger. And how about compared to the time that he pulled Oleg first time?
SPEAKER_00: How do you feel after the match with Oleg? Yes, we can see that. And how does he see his chances this time? Percentage-wise, yes.
SPEAKER_00: So, it doesn't matter who the opponent is, he feels that it's always 50-50. Oh, okay. So, we are gonna play the humble guy. Yeah, yo. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Do you want me to say everything that Betkely said? Yes, I understand everything. Betkely says that when he competed in the European and World Championships, he weighed 75-80 kg. But now he is 100 kg.
SPEAKER_00: And he said that with the previous match, which was with you, he was stronger, very strong. And when we talked about chances, about victories, he said that it was 50-50.
SPEAKER_00: So Oleg feels the same way as well but 60-40 like respect sign and of course he feels that Betkili is going to be favorite as well. Okay so Betkili says 50-50 and Oleg says 60-40. 60-40 yes. Yeah and is it
SPEAKER_02: Tell Oleg if he believes that Betkili really says how he believes or he is just being like some political, you know, like, you know what I mean? What do you think, Oleg, when Betkili says that chances are 50-50, is it true? Well, I think he just says that. I think he understands that he is stronger.
SPEAKER_00: You think he's stronger, right? I think he's stronger, yes. Oleg says that it's just like the talking. And he feels that Betkili thinks he's stronger than him. And Betkili... Sorry, what were you saying, Oleg? Oleg said the same thing about Betkili.
SPEAKER_00: So, Betkili said that when he says 50-50, he thinks 50-50 as well. But when Oleg says 60-40, it's because he wants to stay humble.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay. Okay. So both, they don't believe each other. Okay. Anyway. It will be a very interesting fight.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he says that like the table and competition is going to show everything. Okay, yeah. Okay, I understand. Yeah. And can you ask Betkili if he has plans to pull in two categories as well? So, 95 and 105, yes? Yeah, 95 and 105. Betkili, do you think he will be able to make it to the second category in 2015 and 2015? Yes, I think he will make it to 2015.
SPEAKER_00: so he feels that like the competing in 105 will feel very like comfortable as well when where does he see himself in in that category like rank wise um
SPEAKER_00: So he says that he cannot say that one prematurely. Whenever he's going to pull one or two good opponents, then he's going to estimate his true form, you know, and then he's going to... Okay, then in the beginning, who does he want to pull?
SPEAKER_00: How does he pull Devon? For example, Devon pulls Devon. Devon? Yes, Devon. Oh, left arm, okay. Left arm, yes. The first move is to pull Devon and I pull Devon.
SPEAKER_00: So, he thinks that it's going to be good competition because it's debut of Devin in 105 and it's going to be like Betkili's debut in 105 as well. So, they are going to test each other.
SPEAKER_02: So, he tested the waters, Devon tested the waters in 105 in right hand, so he did not in the left, so it's going to be against Betkid. Wow, okay. Okay. And Oleg, is there anyone up to 85 kg that has chance against you? So, okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Oleg, do you think that there is someone in the 85kg category who has a chance against you? I think that...
SPEAKER_04: Maybe... I will try to make sure they don't have a chance. But maybe there are some good, promising Kazakhs, with whom we will have a good fight. But I will try to make sure they don't have a chance. Do you think the Kazakhs will have a chance? Well, 50-50. There is a chance to have a good fight.
SPEAKER_00: So he says that he's gonna make sure that no one has such a chance at 85 to beat him. It's the same time he says that like the Kazakhstani arm wrestlers are very strong.
SPEAKER_00: no one like specifically he mentioned and at the same time he said that like um he's gonna make sure that no one would touch him at 85. okay okay so at 85 he's confident yeah he's confident okay if i would kill it
SPEAKER_01: If you don't want to do it, you can't do it. You can't do it.
SPEAKER_02: Mm-hmm. So, like, Betkili says that if Tutberidze is going to cut weight to 85, he's going to give good competition to Oleg, Betkili says. He gave already good competition, but that is not enough to, you know, have a target, you know, like, I'm going to give Oleg a good competition. If Tutberidze wants to pull Oleg again, he needs to come with a mindset that this time I'm going to beat Oleg because he already had his one chance.
SPEAKER_02: Shut up. Who got frozen? I got frozen. Did you hear what I said? Can you hear me now? I hear you, yeah. I want to ask to Oleg Zok. I said, Oleg, who would you want to pull?
SPEAKER_02: You know, of course, now you're going to focus on Betkili, but like next match, if he said to you, you are the world champion in 85 kilo, who would you want to pull? Aydar Khan? Rez Serdekian? Daniel Prokopcik?
SPEAKER_00: Who will be better to compete, Aydar Khan, Sedrak Yan or Prokopchuk? Who is better? Yes, 85 in your category.
SPEAKER_00: How do you think, will Aydar Khan be stronger than Prokopchuk and Sedrakian?
SPEAKER_04: Aydar Khan has more different techniques. Aydar Khan can play hook, topspin and triceps. He is more functional. Universal.
SPEAKER_00: Oleg said that like the either hand compared to the rack and compared to Prokopchuk as well, he's like the versatile. He can pull in biceps, in triceps, like a top roll, anything, you know, that's why he presents.
SPEAKER_00: much stronger like the competition compared to the other ones because like even the Prokopchuk and Sedraken he mentioned they are like the one-dimensional one-dimensional arm wrestlers yeah but sometimes it's better to be one-dimensional and then do that very well instead of being divided you know but we will see
SPEAKER_02: Okay. And Betkili wanted to pull against Devon. Yeah. Looks like these guys are not going to mess with each other. They save everything for the table. One guy says 50-50. Other guy says, no, my opponent is stronger. And so it looks like they don't have anything to say to each other. We can talk about the predictions and they both know who they want to pull the next.
SPEAKER_02: So then let's start. Let's start. Azad versus Daniil. No, he understands, I think. He wants to... Engin Terzi said that you have nothing to talk about.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, what did you translate? I mean if you didn't translate what I said because I just said
SPEAKER_04: I told him that they don't have anything against Ustinov. No, that wasn't for the translator. It was just like, yeah. Oleg, who's winning, Azad or Daniel Ustinov? Who will win, Ustinov or Azad? It's the same strategy. I'll rate them 50 to 50.
SPEAKER_04: So Oleg said that it's going to be like a very difficult competition. He feels like it's going to be 50-50 or 55-45 towards
SPEAKER_02: from Kazakhstan, Daniil Rustinov. And Betkili, you don't need to translate, I understand. Azad Betkili, Azad or Daniil Rustinov? I am a very good person, and I would like to say that I am very happy to be among the favorites of Rustinov.
SPEAKER_00: So, Betkili feels pretty much the same way. They are two different type of style pullers. But he feels that Ustinov is going to be favorite in this match. Still, Ustinov is the favorite. Okay, then how about Artur Makarov versus Omer Kozakoğlu? Molek, can you say Kozakoğlu or Artur Makarov?
SPEAKER_00: Umar Kozakolu or Artur Makarov? Who will win? Well, I think it's me for Kozakolu. Kozakolu will win, right? Yes. He feels that Kozakolu is going to win. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And what makes him think that he's going to win? Because Kozakol is for sure less experienced. Does he find this match interesting?
SPEAKER_04: Not so long in this sport. Well, but at the World Championships, I think they fought very hard. They had a very strong fight. Is that right, I think, or not? At the World Championships, they had a strong fight, right? If they had a match, you ask? Yes, at the World Championships, they had a match.
SPEAKER_00: Engin, did they have a match on the World Championship before? No. Kozakol is a very young guy. Kozakol is the winner of the current 80 kilo. He beat Aydar Khan, but on fouls. No, they didn't have a match, but Kozakol beat Aydar Khan on the right hand. I think it will be an interesting match. I don't think it will be one-sided.
SPEAKER_04: Will it be one-sided? No, I don't think so. I think it will be one-sided. Why do you think Kozakov will win? I think it will be an interesting fight. Maybe he won't win, but the fight will be interesting. Because the opponents are all about equal. Plus minus equal.
SPEAKER_00: so he feels that it's going to be very interesting like the competition very interesting pulling like he estimates chances like uh like in 50 50 like it's going to be even match but still for some reason he thinks that uh uh the kozabalu is going to win okay
SPEAKER_01: For me, it's a very interesting thing to be able to do. When I go to the gym in the 80s, I have to train my muscles and my technique is very good. Arthur is also very good. Vagari is also very good. I think I will be able to do it in the 80s and 90s. Mozart is also very good. For me, it's a very interesting thing to be able to do.
SPEAKER_00: So he feels that Koza Golu is a very talented guy. He showed himself on a very good level on this world championship and everything. And as time passes by, he's going to become stronger and better. And on this day and on this competition, the chances are 50-50. 50-50, okay. Okay, I understand. And...
SPEAKER_00: Let's go with... He wants to compete with Larratt at 105 kg. So Oleg asked the question if Betkili really wanted to compete against Larratt. Why was it funny for you? No, now he wants to compete with Larratt.
SPEAKER_04: I understand that he is popular, but he is strong. Do you think that Lared will be strong in 105 kg? I think that he will lose a lot of weight and I'm not sure that he will be as strong as 115 kg.
SPEAKER_00: Oleg, what do you think, 105 kg, if there is an opportunity against Devon, what will be your chances?
SPEAKER_04: I always contact Blarat. I congratulate him on the victory. Maybe I can ask him something. I always make a deal with him about our fight. I need to congratulate him. I made a deal. He said that he was not against it, that he would be worthy and that he would try to prepare.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, can you translate first to us and then you can talk with... Are you talking with Oleg or are you talking with Betkido? I'm talking with Oleg because I didn't understand what he said about...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I just said, like, how does he see his chances? That's all, you know, like... How do you think your chances against Devon are? What are the percentages? It will be... Well, I still have to prepare a lot. I'm not in the form yet to fight with Larratt, but I'm getting there. I think this match will happen sooner or later. 50-50 or what?
SPEAKER_04: So like nothing specific like percentage-wise he feels that like Larat still
SPEAKER_02: In fact, he's losing weight. He's not going to be that strong, but still he's going to be a favorite in this match. Okay, I understand. Okay, let's go to... Do you need something to bet, Kili? No, that's not important. That's not important. Let's go to the next one. Irina Gladkaya versus Brigitta, Oleg. You know Brigitta from Hungary.
SPEAKER_04: Brigitte and Glatka. I don't remember how Glatka fought. I haven't seen her for a long time. But I don't think Glatka is a favorite in this fight. Glatka will be a favorite, right? No, no, no, she won't. He feels that Glatka is not going to be a favorite in this match. Okay, can you ask Batkili, Batkili? Do you know Brigitte?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I know. Okay. And with Gladkaya. So he feels that like the Brigitte is going to be favorite in this match like a 60 to 40 because he has not seen like Gladkaya actively.
SPEAKER_02: and she was the detective he mentioned okay okay and let's go let's go i'm going by category david samusha versus vladimir myro mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm
SPEAKER_00: I think that Mairov will try to catch him and win, but Samusha will win. So Oleg thinks that Mairov is going to stop at some point, like Samusha. They are going to have an interesting and grueling battle, but still feels that Samusha is going to win. And Betkely?
SPEAKER_01: In my opinion, there is no chance that in Samusha and in Vinca, there would have been a situation where Gergioro would have been defeated. In the case of Maioro, I think it is very likely that he would have been defeated, but I do not think that he would have been defeated.
SPEAKER_00: Betkili says that it's a favorable match for Samusha. It's almost 80-20 on his side.
SPEAKER_00: He listened to your, like, the commentary about this match and the estimation about Majorov, that Majorov presses, like, very good on pronator, controls pronator in a good way. But still, Batkili doesn't think that Majorov is going to have enough power to control, like, David Samusha's pronator completely in that level to defeat him. Yeah, when they pulled the first match, first round...
SPEAKER_02: I think Vladimir won and then later he guessed out does he think that if he can bring that endurance to the higher level okay does he does he expect the domination or does he expect a war that like does he think that uh Vladimir will win in a round or not at all
SPEAKER_01: What do you think will happen to Amachev? Will he be able to dominate the team? My opinion is that if Zuz Tadej will be able to win against Majorov, he will be able to win against Samush. And I think he will be able to win against Majorov.
SPEAKER_00: So he says that like that first match that was lost against like Majorov by Samushya, that like the weak point that he had on his hand, Samushya worked on it. He's going to prepare that one as good as possible. So he doesn't feel that it's going to be that much of a competition between them. Okay. Okay. And Irakli versus Tautiev, Oleg.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think, Oleg, Irakli or Tautiev? Irakli. Easy or hard? Is it going to be easy or hard? I think it's going to be hard, but Irakli will win. So it's going to be hard, but Irakli will win. I'm not sure it's going to be hard, but Irakli will win.
SPEAKER_02: So he doesn't feel that it's not going to be that difficult for Irakli and Irakli is going to win. Okay, so there is one mistake I was there. Yeah, it was second round that Mairo won. I think first round he couldn't get it good, but I need to watch again. But it doesn't matter if it's first round, second round, you know, just we need to focus to the point, you know, like early round you want to match. And how do you see the Irakli versus Tautiev, Betkilev?
SPEAKER_01: I would like to say to everyone that I will not be able to do it in 1985. I don't have any plans for the future. I would like to do it in the future, but it is very technical. I would like to do it in the future, but it is very technical. I would like to do it in the future, but it is very technical. I don't have a chance.
SPEAKER_00: So Betkili mentioned Irakli's words, you know, that at 95, no one can touch his right hand. He feels that the Tautiev is a very good arm wrestler. His hand structure and the arm structure is very special. He has a good wrist and everything. And he feels that it's going to be competition in only way if the Tautiev is able to break Irakli's wrist.
SPEAKER_00: And what is the possibility of this? So he doesn't think that like Tautiev is going to able to take Irakli's wrist, but if he's able, then it's going to be 50-50 match. Okay. Yeah. Same as Irakli said. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, let's go. Brigitta versus Karolina. Karolina Pettersson. Not Brigitta, sorry. Dimitri Petrova versus Karolina Pettersson, Oleg. Karolina. Karolina? Yes. So, Karolina will cap roll. Karolina, Karolina. Yeah, Karolina will cap roll. Dimitri, on the wrist. So, will he win with the top?
SPEAKER_00: uh she's going to win with the broken wrist like this way like the flapper is this yes she will press with the triceps
SPEAKER_02: Oleg, Oleg, Oleg, are you joking with me, my friend? Karolina is the top roller one. Dimitina is the one that is just goes with the press and hook. Why would Karolina go this way? Dimitina is not even top roller. What do you think, why will Karolina do that? Well, because she, well, like, there will be a fist. It will depend on who is the first to twist the fist. Aha, you think the fist will work, right? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: So he feels that Karolina's wrist is going to go back. That's why he thinks that it's going to be pressed. Okay, but why would Karolina's wrist go back when Dimitryna is a hookballer? What do you think? Dimitryna is a hookballer. And why do you think that Karolina's wrist will be like this?
SPEAKER_02: If they go to the hook, then Dimitriina will win. You think Dimitriina will win? If they go to the hook. He says that they are going to hook. Yes. Okay, let's not go there because if it goes hook, Dimitriina is gonna kill Karolina. If Karolina top rolls, Karolina is gonna win.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. Okay, there is another. Smartest, let them give us just come on, man, just please, you know, just get educated, you know, anyways, basically, Carolina versus Dimitri now.
SPEAKER_01: So, according to their last appearance, both of them are in great shape. So, Bettini thinks that it's going to be even like the 50-50 match. Wow.
SPEAKER_02: it looks like according to the betkili as long as it is not georgian match all the matches 50 50 but the georgians win
SPEAKER_00: mm-hmm so he says that like uh he's um how to say he's saying everything like a straightforward if he's not 21 if like the georgian is if he feels that georgian is going to lose he's going to say that he is going to lose you know but because he feels that everyone is in great shape that's why he's saying that everyone wins okay okay
SPEAKER_02: Let's go to the next category. What does he think about Oguzhan Kochak versus Nugo? Let's start with Betkili. Betkili, what do you think about Oguzhan Kochak and Nugo? Kochak, when he came to Europe, was one of the best in the world.
SPEAKER_01: In the 30-hertz range and in the large range, it is possible to reach a maximum of 31 watts. And in the large range, it is possible to reach a maximum of 31 watts. And in the large range, it is possible to reach a maximum of 31 watts. And in the large range, it is possible to reach a maximum of 31 watts.
SPEAKER_01: So, he recalled like the Oguzan's last competitions that he was participating in seniors and juniors almost at the same time.
SPEAKER_00: and was beating like the good competition. He recalled that he beat Sashu Andreev, he beat Tautiev as well. He beat Flamen Dimitrov, he beat Sashu, he beat Jordan Tshonev, he beat Krasimir. He has won against all of them.
SPEAKER_00: So he feels that when he was competing, when Oguzhan was competing, he was in a great shape, but lately he was not active.
SPEAKER_00: it's the same time nougat was very active you know yeah it's going to be possible for august to bring such a shape that he was like the bringing on these competitions previous competitions then it's going to be very even match like 50 50 match okay so if all's done is as good as possible then it's 50 50. and if all's done is not as it used to be so nugo is the favorite that's what he says yes he says that way okay and then oleg
SPEAKER_00: What do you think, Oleg, Oguzhan or Nugo? I don't know these sportsmen. I don't know. Oguzhan Kocak and Nugo Chikadze. I don't remember if they lied. I can't say. So Oleg says that he doesn't know these armwrestlers. That's why he's not going to say some comments. You don't know Oguzhan Kocak? Oleg, are we sportsmen of you?
SPEAKER_02: So what did you ask again, Sergey? No, I'm asking, Oleg, Oguzhan Kochak? You don't know Oguzhan Kochak? He asked, don't you know Oguzhan Kochak? Is it category 75?
SPEAKER_02: So was he participating in the 75 kilograms? I mean, he's many times world champion. Last time he won the world, but it was right before the pandemic. He beat Jordan Sone in 100 kilos. And he also won the slow feature in 86 kilos. He beat Clement Dimitrov in the final. 86 kilograms, Engin says.
SPEAKER_00: He competed, he beat Jordan Tsoneva before the pandemic. And he beat such wrestlers as Sasha Andreev and Marcio Barbosa too. Do you know? I already understood. He is from 85 categories, right? Yes, yes, 86-87.
SPEAKER_04: He was in my weight category. I've already mentioned it. Yes, yes, yes. I probably even fought with him. Did you fight with him? Or not? Probably. I'm not sure. I don't remember. Maybe he fought with him. So, Oleg says that now he remembers about these matches, what kind of opponents.
SPEAKER_02: like Oguzhan Kocak beat previously. And he remembered that they were participated in same category as well. And he does not particularly remember, but maybe they met each other as well. No, Oguzhan is right hand puller. Okay, never mind. Yeah, okay. So if he doesn't know, doesn't know. Yeah, let's go. Betkeli. Yoshinobu Kanai versus Tata Shinks. Do you know Kanai, Betkeli?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I know. In my opinion, Tat Hachins is going to be the favorite in this match. Oleg, do you know Kanai from Japan? Do you know Yoshinobu Kanai? He is Japanese.
SPEAKER_00: So which category he was participating in heavyweight? I mean, if he doesn't know Kanae, he will not remember just because I said the category, but yeah, right now he will be pulling 105. Now he will be comparing 105 kg, but he fought with John Bzenka and Michael Todd too. Do you know?
SPEAKER_02: I don't remember exactly. So he doesn't really remember? That's very surprising that Oleg Zok has been in Poland for 15 years. He doesn't know Kocak, he doesn't know Nugo, he doesn't know Kanai. It's very interesting. But it's okay. So he...
SPEAKER_02: Let's go to the next one. Devon versus Petrenko, Oleg. Yes. Lasha, your connection is bad, Lasha?
SPEAKER_00: it's okay lasha yeah my connection is better unfortunately yeah can you hear me now yeah we hear you now yeah i asked i asked yeah petrenko versus devon yeah
SPEAKER_04: Okay, Oleg, you tell us. We don't hear you, Lasha. I think Petrenko should win, but Larratt is also a very unpredictable athlete. If he continues to play, and Petrenko doesn't win the first three rounds, it will be difficult for Petrenko.
SPEAKER_04: Lasha? So can you hear me now? Yeah, we hear you now, yeah. Can you tell Oleg to repeat? Can you say something else? Because I didn't hear Oleg. Okay, okay, I'll say it. I think Petrenko will win, but Lorat is a very persistent and unpredictable opponent, and he's very strong. But I'll still vote for Petrenko.
SPEAKER_02: So, he said that Devon looks like a very unpredictable opponent, but still he feels that Petrenko is going to win. Somebody says that he doesn't remember things after the injury. No, he remembers. He remembers Tatashins, he remembers Petrenko. It is because probably he doesn't follow closely. Please, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Don't say things that are just like him, come on. Oleg, yeah. I don't think that Oleg has memory. He remembers everything. Okay. Oleg, people are saying like... Okay, never mind. Bethkely, how do you see this match? Oleg Shekhodroze.
SPEAKER_01: So, Betkely said that like on the last competition against Dadikian, Petrenko... What's that?
SPEAKER_00: We don't hear. Maybe I better ask Roman because he may have better connection. Now can you hear me? Yeah, but this happens every probably 30-40 seconds, so we don't understand. Say again? Okay, so Betkili said that on the last competition against Dadikian, Petrenko looked very strong. He beat him very easily, but at the same time he feels that...
SPEAKER_00: Devon is very unpredictable opponent and if weight cut is not going to take too much power out of him, still Devon is going to be favorite to win. Devon is there. I don't think it's going to happen. I don't think it's going to happen.
SPEAKER_00: Oleg, people want to know if you have any problems with
SPEAKER_00: Do you have some problems with memory? Yeah, everything is okay. No, right? No, like he says that nothing.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, okay, because I see some people are bullshitting here. So he says that he remembers everything. Yes, yes, yes, that's what I thought. Yeah, thank you, Oleg.
SPEAKER_04: Rino versus Stagov, Oleg. Rino Mastich, Ibrahim Stagov. I think Rino will win. Rino is very strong. Which hand will they fight on? Right or left? Right, right, right. Right hand, right hand. I think Rino will win. So he feels that Rino is going to win.
SPEAKER_00: So he feels that Sago is going to be favorite in this match, but it's the same time he thinks that it's not going to be a long match, you know?
SPEAKER_00: long match okay sago is the favorite but it's gonna be a long match with the shoulder he doesn't feel that it's not going to be a long match it's not going to be a long match it's not going to be a long match so he said that pago is going to dominate
SPEAKER_00: So he feels that, like, Sago is going to remain as a favorite. And, like, who hits on the start first is going to win. That's why it's not going to be a long match. Okay. Okay. And let's go to some other matches. Vitaly Laletin versus Georgy Dzeranov. Oleg. Oleg Laletin.
SPEAKER_04: Laletin is going to win? Easy or hard? Easy or hard? He feels that it's not going to be an easy match, but with the top roll Laletin is going to win. Okay, and Badkili?
SPEAKER_01: So he feels that it's going to be a very interesting match, one of the most interesting matches on the card.
SPEAKER_00: and he feels that it's going to be like like a toss-up match but still like laletin's experience is going to play an important part in the 60 40 on laletin's favor um
SPEAKER_00: So he feels that like Zerano has a winning like percentage of course and winning chance but he doesn't think that it's going to be possible for Zerano to drag Laletin into the hook. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: okay let's go to another match michael todd versus gennady oleg gennady quick winner okay and hard match easy match uh not easy not easy long match yeah hard match yeah yes and oleg before i ask to betkili
SPEAKER_04: Where are you, percentage-wise, compared to before your accident, your shape? Well, she won't be at 100% as she was, but I try to prepare her as much as possible to the level she was at before the accident.
SPEAKER_00: So he doesn't feel that it's ever going to be the 100% which was like before the car crash, but now he chose as hard as he can to go back to such a shape. Okay, but how close is he now?
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's getting better and better every time, but it's average. Don't you think it's 60-70% of what it was before? Well, it's 60-70%. So, when he pulls now, he feels comfortable with his hand and everything, but
SPEAKER_02: Still feels that 60-70% close to his previous form. Look at Betkeli's forearm. I've never seen Betkeli's forearm this week. Andrea, you are following everything very closely. Yes, last time he said he was 50%. Now 60-70% means that he's getting better. What did he say, Betkeli said?
SPEAKER_00: No, now Betkili says that it grew a little bit in the last time. Not a little bit. It's like big in here. And it looks good. It looks good and very dangerous. Is it 190 cm? You had the same exact information. 1.90 meters.
SPEAKER_00: So he can easily pull 105 as well. He said he's already 100 kilos, so he can go both categories. What did Oleg say? What did Betkili say? Betkili said that his left hand is bigger than before. And then Engin said, what's your height? And he...
SPEAKER_02: He said it was 1.90 meters. On this card, which match do you like more than the others?
SPEAKER_04: But now I'm focusing on my match, and all the others that I'm going to watch, I'm going to evaluate when I'm going to be there. So he feels that the most interesting match is his match. Okay. And other than his match? After your match, what do you think will be the most interesting? I think that Petrenko-Lorat will be the most interesting.
SPEAKER_02: After his match, the most interesting is going to be Petrenko and Larratt, of course. And Betkile, which match is the most interesting for you in this event? I think the most interesting match for me is the one with Ali Jean-Muratov and Ivan Matushenko. Betkile as a left-arm guy, his most interesting match is also a left-arm match. I think it's going to be interesting for everyone.
SPEAKER_01: So not only for the reason that they are left arm pullers.
SPEAKER_00: For him, it's very interesting because for the Muratov, it's going to be new weight category, 115. He's going to pull that for the first time. And at the same time, he's facing one of the most legendary, like the armwrestler, Steven Matushenko, who is in great shape as well. And how does he see this match since he started talking about? Still feels it's going to be 50-50 match.
SPEAKER_00: okay then tell him that it sounds like i said a good card if he is thinking a lot of measure 50 50. so for him it's going to be one of the best competitions that he's ever seen yeah yeah i agree and oleg how do you see
SPEAKER_04: Ivan Matyushenko vs. Alizhan Murado. What do you think about Matyushenko? I think it will be a very interesting fight. I don't think he will be one-sided. I think there will be a very good fight, because Ivan Matyushenko is also an old and experienced athlete. And Alizhan will also prepare very well and it will be a very intense fight.
SPEAKER_00: So he feels that it's not going to be like one dimensional match, like winning by either side, but still feels that Alijan is very strong. So Alijan is favorite? So he feels that Alijan is going to be slight favorite. Slight favorite, okay.
SPEAKER_02: And did we miss any match? Sorry. Because I just went through my memory. What did we forget? I think we covered all the matches.
SPEAKER_02: okay we went there there there there yes i think we did all of them yeah anyway so guys uh we are gonna finish it and is there anything you guys would like to add to to yes
SPEAKER_04: I want to thank Tereza for a very cool tournament, for a very cool event that he is holding, where he has gathered all the best. I will try very hard to move to the next weight category. Since I will now be 95 kg, I will prepare as much as possible to make a good weight class.
SPEAKER_00: So he's thanking you for putting up such a great event and giving him such a match as well. He feels that like in the new category, 95, he's going to prepare himself as good as he can and at least give you the good match. Thank you. Thank you, Oleg. Thank you, my friend. And Betkel, anything you want to say?
SPEAKER_01: How do you feel about this event? It is an event of a kind, and I believe that we have a good relationship with the government, and we will continue to do so, and I believe that the government will do what we want. It is a very interesting event, and everyone is interested in it, and everyone has different opinions.
SPEAKER_00: So for him, it's not only the title defense, but it's the rematch as well. So he feels extra motivation for it. It's the same time he feels that like the card is amazing. Every match is like even, like 50-50 and very interesting at the same time.
SPEAKER_02: yeah that's that's good oh the bet he asked uh when is going to be time timeline for you and to return to the competition yeah i started training five weeks ago only five weeks ago and i don't know where it's gonna go he feels that you're looking in very good shape
SPEAKER_02: Ah, not really. But in 12 days, I will be 50 years old, October 18, I will be 50. I don't know how my elbows everything handles. But right now, I'm like maximum 50% at the table and with the weights 6570 maybe maybe but I'm not your birthday. 12 days later, 12 days later, I will be 50 years old, but
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if I can make a comeback or not, but I'm trying. I want to do it, you know. I want to train. I never pull Oleg or Berkili in a competition, but I pull both of them in a practice. Can you ask them if they remember to train a little bit, practice? I understand that Berkili is a five-year-old.
SPEAKER_00: It is said that he was born in 12th century, he was born in 12th century, he was born in 12th century, he was born in 12th century, he was born in 12th century, he was born in 12th century, he was born in 12th century, he was born in 12th century, he was born in 12th century,
SPEAKER_01: He remembers that after pool with you, he said that he was competing under 21 at that time.
SPEAKER_02: And he pulled you like four or five days before the competition. And he mentioned that your arm felt very uncomfortable and you were pressing pronation in different way. Yeah, he and I, we actually pulled in Bulgaria, European Championship 2018, after he won his category in the seniors. He did a final with Irakli, I think. Uriyatas Tugbeci.
SPEAKER_02: uh or he says that it was in 2017. no 18. oh 18 years 18 bulgaria bulgaria 18. he did fine and then he found his category and he pulled with me and then he pulled with oleg zog and he was hooking oleg zog and he was the the best hero of oleg's of 2018 but he was hooking him and yeah anyway so you don't need to ask oleg either you know but just maybe
SPEAKER_00: They said that you never met Sengin at the competition. But you once fought behind the scenes. If you remember it. I don't remember it well. It was a long time ago. 10 years ago.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, of course. It was 10 years ago. 10 years, yes, Oleg. I remember, but it's already bad. At that time, Oleg was 70 kilos. I was 75 kilos. I was one category above Oleg. When you were fighting, you were competing at 70 kilos, and Engin Terzi at 75. Yes, I started at 60.
SPEAKER_00: She said she said she said she said, oh, he says it like at first he was starting competition. He started competition at 60.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. I remember the first time in 65 kilos in Antalya, European Championships, 2011. Do you remember? I remember, yes. In 2011, European Championships in Antalya, Turkey, and then Kazakhstan. Wow, you were 65 kilos. He says that 65 kilos in the 2011 European Championships,
SPEAKER_00: He mentioned that he won the competition in those years. Yes, in Antalya you beat Serhat Arslan.
SPEAKER_04: In Kazakhstan, you beat Aleksandr Kovalchuk. Yes, it was in 2019. I beat Kovalchuk and beat everyone. I beat Kovalchuk first, then I beat Kovalchuk.
SPEAKER_02: Kovalchuk won one match against him, one match. Yes, yes, yes. And then he beat Kovalchuk twice. I lost the semi-final and in the final I won with two winners. Yes, yes, yes, I remember. In your category, you lost only one time to Kovalchuk and one time to Mazgan Shamiev, one match in Zloty 2015. He says that in your category you lost only
SPEAKER_00: Two people, and he said his name. Yes, yes. Cebulova just lost at the start. Vileni Gabrava stopped at San Agebi. Vileni Gabrava stopped at San Agebi? Vileni Gabrava. So, Betkili says that he lost with Vileni Gabrava as well. But when? Do you remember Vileni Romo Ugo? That was in the school.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe he was his first year or something. Yeah, 2011. After 2011, he didn't lose, but maybe before. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Vileni Gabrava, Georgian. Vileni Gabrava, Artsakhian. In which category? Maybe in 60kg, but before 2011. In 2011 you competed in 60kg or 65kg?
SPEAKER_04: Ah, the first time I fought at the European Championship, in 2010 or 2011, and there I became the third, it was 2010. Ah, and the category was 65 or 60? 60, 60. 60 kilograms. 60 kilograms? Yes, 60 kilograms. Okay, it was probably his first year or something, you know, yeah. Was it your first competition? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yes. It was the first competition of him. Yeah, yeah. See, he remembers everything. Even 14 years ago, he remembers. That is why. I mean, he may have some temporary things, but not because he doesn't remember or something. But yeah. And Betkili, I want to ask you something before we close. Who do you think that would win at 85 kilo?
SPEAKER_01: Left arm, Daniel Prokopchuk or Royce Serdekian? In 45 kilos, would you choose Prokopchuk or Sedrachian? Prokopchuk and Sedrachian will be interesting, but Sedrachian will be in that form, as far as I know, in Europe and Europe. In my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: So he feels that it's a very interesting match at 85, but if Cedrakian has the previous shape that he was showing at Worlds and Europeans, he feels that slight favorite and slight edge is going to be on Cedrakian's side. Is it because of endurance?
SPEAKER_01: I would like to thank Daniele Maramgonia for the opportunity to speak with me today. I would like to thank Daniele Maramgonia for the opportunity to speak with me today. I would like to thank Daniele Maramgonia for the opportunity to speak with me today. I would like to thank Daniele Maramgonia for the opportunity to speak with me today.
SPEAKER_00: So he feels that the endurance is one of the reasons for it, but he still thinks that the kind of shape that Sedrakian showed in 2018 against him, he thinks that that's why he's going to be a little favorite, and he thinks that Prokopchuk is a great puller, but still he's not going to be able to take Sedrakian's wrist.
SPEAKER_02: With left arm, Prokopchuk is going inside. With right arm, Prokopchuk can go inside. Left arm is usually going inside, yeah. But it would be incredible match. Yeah, go ahead. He says that with Bozidar Simeonov,
SPEAKER_02: Prokopchuk took his like a hand in the top. Yeah, yeah, he did. Yes, that's true. That's true. That's true. Yeah. When that was surprised to ask him, was it surprised for him?
SPEAKER_02: Well, yeah, it was surprising. Because normally with left arm, he's going like this and this side. It's very good that Betkili is following the... There are athletes, they are focused on their thing, but they don't really follow arm wrestling. Looks like Betkili follows everything and great job, Betkili. Yes, Betkili, you know that there are sportsmen who don't know how to do sports. They are focused on their sport.
SPEAKER_00: like he loves the sport and he tries to follow everyone and everything that's good that's good i i like that i like that you know they are not only concentrated on
SPEAKER_02: themselves but they they are also fan of the sports i love it anyways guys uh lasha thank you for your translation and helping it's great to see you again and oleg my friend you are a legend we love you so much and just come istanbul just remember win or lose i mean you have nothing to lose like you are
SPEAKER_02: Badkili, my friend, you have been doing great. Every time I look at your Instagram story, your biceps are getting big. I would like to see you also in... You have an unfinished business with Alijan Murado. Remember? This is an interesting business. Let's start with Alijan Murado. This is interesting indeed. I've been working with him for a long time. Alijan, why don't you say something?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, like Metkili is asking if Alijan is going to go down to 105. Of course, this is his category. He is only going for more categories. Right now, he is 105 kilo champion. Ivan Matushenko, 115. And Morozov. The next match is Vitaly Laletin and Artem Morozov for the super heavyweight. And then, most likely, the winner, if Alijan wins, then Alijan probably is going to go after Vitaly.
SPEAKER_00: But if Ivan wins, since he lost against Morozov, maybe he will have to do some other matches in that category before pulling against Vitaly. Yes, I think that the next scenario will be like this. Alizhan will be in the top 15, he will be in the top 15 category. But what do you think about this scenario? If Matushenko wins,
SPEAKER_00: Morozov and Lalitinichor were killed by Alizhan. And if Matushenko was killed, Matushenko's brother would also be killed by Morozov and he would be killed by Magmarchi. There are many things that we don't know yet. If we look at the photo of Alizhan, we can say that he was killed by Magmarchi.
SPEAKER_02: So like he saw some picture of Alijan when he weighted approximately 120 kilograms. That's why he was curious if he was coming down. Listen, Alijan was about 105 kilo. I mean, when did he gain all that weight, 120 already? So I don't know if it is real or not. And we will see. We will see. But I don't think he's 115. And if he doesn't have any intention,
SPEAKER_02: go down to 105 then like he will tell me and from now on i don't want to pull 105 so i will not wait for one year and then i will just give the give the title to another you know title match you know but if he wants to pull 105 i think that he needs to pull first with petrenko and maybe
SPEAKER_02: We don't know if it was 15 kilos or not, and we can't say that he lost 15 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: so he says that like doesn't matter what happens in 105 or heavyweight
SPEAKER_02: He wants to pull Devon at first. Okay. Okay. If Devon accepts, yeah. Why not? Yeah. Yeah. Once again, thank you guys. Thank you, Betkili. Thank you, Oleg. Thank you, Lasha. You take care. And I see you guys in around, what is that? What's today? Sixth? So I will see you guys three and a half weeks later.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Take care. Take care. Thank you. Thank you for everything. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
