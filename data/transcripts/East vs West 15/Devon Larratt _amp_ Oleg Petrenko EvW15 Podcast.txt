SPEAKER_00: so hungry so hungry oh oleg is saying i have only two kilos left to to lose okay yeah oleg what was your weight where are you coming down you said only two left it means that you were also heavy
SPEAKER_02: he's saying 108 uh was about three weeks ago but maximum on this prep he was at 110. okay okay and how much yours left though oh god
SPEAKER_01: It was 55 last time I asked you, but I think it was two days ago. I think this is the morning. I was still at two 56 this morning. So you're joking. No, I'm serious. I'm serious. So probably all day long, all day long. I'm walking. So like one 16. So I got like 11, 11 kilo. Yeah. 11, 12 kilo. Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: I arrive on Sunday. Yeah. Sunday I'm there. Yeah. And I'll be just walking and walking and walking. I'll just eat less and less and less until I'm good. I'm good. I will walk myself all the way to that way scale. And what do you plan to be here when you arrive here Sunday? Hopefully,
SPEAKER_01: hopefully less than 115 you know okay so you will be around 250. i i that would be great if i can get to if i can get to 250 or 253 or like 114 115 i think i can do the 10 kilo water cut at the end no problem that's interesting yeah and that was that was the plan
SPEAKER_01: This was the plan. Yeah, this was the plan. So we'll see everything's going according to plan right now. It's I'm, I'm doing everything I gotta do. I'm, I'm walking all day. I'm just eating, I'm just eating meat. So just protein and fat. So I feel good. I have good energy. I don't think I'm losing much lean mass, hopefully just a little bit of fat and then glycogen and the way that, and then here we go away goes the water and we compete.
SPEAKER_02: He says that he will come to Istanbul in a week and will walk until the end of the trip. The plan is that he wants to come to Istanbul somewhere like 115 or a little less. Well, he will slowly throw away. He says, I hope that I will not throw away the meat, but I will throw away a little more fat, and then, he says, somewhere there, about 10 kilograms, just with oil and water. When the time comes, everything will be fine. I also come on Monday, I will keep it.
SPEAKER_01: Oleg saying that he will be there on Monday and he will watch you. Perfect. We'll go for a walk. We'll go for a walk. That'll be great. That'll be great. Yeah, you can watch my suffering. I'll be like the phoenix when I refill, though. I'll be so full of life. I'll be reborn on Friday.
SPEAKER_02: Alex is saying that he hopes that you will regenerate your power.
SPEAKER_01: I am so excited about our match. I am so excited to face this young champion. It is when I look at my entire career, I am no question looking forward to this match as much as, as a world title match in an open division. For me, it's an incredible, incredible honor to get to go after the 105 kilo East versus West belt.
SPEAKER_02: I think that Oleg is the best and I can't wait to face him.
SPEAKER_02: he's saying that he's waiting for this match very much too it's very special match for him especially with you devon and yeah that's that's gonna be his uh first uh title uh proof right
SPEAKER_00: Oleg, is this your best shape ever? Like right now I look at you, you look big, really big. Is this your best shape ever? Or you are the same as the last two times that we saw you against Ongarbaev and Dadikian?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, I was in better shape than Unarabayev. Previously, with Unarabayev, I was in the best shape. With Dadykyan, I was in a slightly worse shape than with Unarabayev. And now I am stronger in strength. And I added weights. In the past, I weighed 107 kg maximum. And now I have 110 kg. I have strength and now I am so good.
SPEAKER_02: Oleg saying yes, he's in his best shape. Previous best shape was on Garbaev. Was that he can was a little bit off, but very good shape, but a little less than was on Garbaev. But now he is better than was on Garbaev. His power and his, you know, lifting abilities in the gym are the best. His body weight was at maximum of 107 before and now he exceed 110. So his best shape ever.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg is thinking that he will drop a little bit less than 105. He will probably be at 103-104 just to increase his endurance to the maximum. That's the same thing Georgians do.
SPEAKER_00: For the same reason. I think they don't want to get pumped or something. I think this is what Irakli was saying. There are two superstars. Dino says that, oh my God, Oleg, Devon is going to beat you so bad. Three champions.
SPEAKER_02: uh paulo can you translate it to that but this is not what i am saying i don't want him to super chat uh
SPEAKER_03: foreign foreign foreign
SPEAKER_02: Oleg is saying, yeah, no problem. I've been there before. That was on their behalf, especially with the decant too. Everybody was giving me like, whatever, 20%. And I've been there already a couple of times, but I know that I'm ready. And I set my mindset, you know, to win. So no problem. We'll see. I think. Very good. Yeah. Very good.
SPEAKER_02: I think Engin is frozen. I think he's frozen too. That's no problem. Oleg, you're still working. Yeah, I'm working. Oleg, how old are you? Oleg, how old are you? 28. 28. 28. Very good. You're 49, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Um, I want to say, I want to say super clearly that I really, really love and really respect his teacher, Andre Pushkar. I love Andre Pushkar. .
SPEAKER_01: And this, this mat for me is extra special because of our connection to Andre. I pulled Andre when I guess, I guess he would have been maybe 17, you know? And I know that in a way I feel as though this match, I don't know. I feel like it's somehow ties us together.
SPEAKER_02: He says that this is a very important match for him, because through such a connection with Andriy, and he says that we fought with Andriy even when he was there, he says, I don't remember exactly, maybe even 17, and he says that through this match, I feel some kind of connection with Andriy, so he is very, very special to me. For me, too, this match is important, and one of the things that Andriy
SPEAKER_02: he's saying yeah the same it's very important for me because of andre and it has a connection and maybe it's going to be a major revenge for him uh we'll see but this prehistory is making this very important
SPEAKER_01: What advice does Devon have for Petrenko for the upcoming trench battle? I'd say that he should already accept that loss is just a form of teaching, of education. He should look forward to taking the lessons that I teach him.
SPEAKER_01: and incorporate them into his practice, into his life. Uh, I am, I am humbled to give him my tutelage.
SPEAKER_02: Someone made a super chat, a comment on the Internet says, what advice do you have for your match, which will be soon for Oleg? Larad says, well, I advised him to set it up so that his defeat
SPEAKER_02: good advice yeah yeah he's saying that's funny okay three more warren edmonds he says love from new zealand hello hello greetings to new zealand dinos has again
SPEAKER_00: I love Oleg, but Devin is Devin. Sorry, Oleg. And real to ice, what your thoughts on Forwarder versus Leonidas? Yeah, this is not exactly the subject. But so, Oleg, how much is this super match for you? How much is for Pushkar? And how much is for yourself?
SPEAKER_02: Like, what is your motivation? All together. What part of this match is for you, and what part of this match is for Andriy Pushkar? How much? What is your motivation? How much for you personally, and how much for Andriy? 50-50. That's why I said before that this match is very important for me. And not only because of the title. The title, of course, is important. Because I want to win the title.
SPEAKER_03: I'm not the strongest in that category, but Andriy's defeat is a win-win for me. I want Andriy to defeat Devon.
SPEAKER_02: uh he's saying like 50 50 50 because yes i want to prove that this is my class and i'm the best in 105 but on another hand uh i wanna do that revenge for andre because last time he lost uh pretty badly and uh you know uh he wanna he wanna give uh devil some revenge for andre and oleg were you were you were you andre's uh student at that time or you saw this later like were you involved in arm wrestling at that time
SPEAKER_03: Or you started armwrestling after that match? I was already in armwrestling at the age of 12, if I'm not mistaken. At that time I started training, I was about 15 years old. I watched that match many times, and not so long after that, just for motivation.
SPEAKER_03: I want to ask, as I see people writing in the chat, I can be sure that this will be an easy match for Devon. I can say that for sure. I think Devon understands that it's not the final, but the match will be very difficult. As for me, I understand that. And for Devon, too.
SPEAKER_02: okay yeah uh he's saying yeah he was involved in arm wrestling already in a kids arm wrestling he was about 15 years old or so and uh uh afterwards he was watching that match many many times and even uh just recently he rewatched it and uh yes he was involved and he said I just want to add something that I hope that Devon understands the same as I do that it's not going to be an easy match neither for Devon and neither for me it's going to be
SPEAKER_01: serious battle i i totally anticipate that i uh i've trained my hardest for you oleg my very hardest this is the best i can be right now for you for you not only for you you say 50 50 for me 85 because of you but still 15 out of respect to your teacher i extra extra
SPEAKER_01: Um, I I'm in the best shape I can be. I've sacrificed. Uh, I am so looking forward to a glorious, glorious fight.
SPEAKER_02: He says, you say 50 to 50 for you, for me he says no, he says 85% for you and 15% for your teacher, for Andrey. He says that I came to this very, very seriously, I trained very hard for you.
SPEAKER_02: And he says, I sacrificed a lot to be in this shape. And he says that I am the best I can be for you now. So it will be a very bright fight. Okay, I will know that Devon was in a good shape. I wonder if he learned Ukrainian words or if he will speak. Repeat the last one. I wonder if Devon learned Ukrainian words.
SPEAKER_02: he's saying he's saying very very good that you're in a best form that I know and realize that I'm dealing with the best Devon whatever you can be and he he's asking did you learn a couple Ukrainian words or no wait wait I'll do my best I'll do my best in time hopefully I show up with a little bit
SPEAKER_02: Okay. For now, just Petrenko, Petrenko, Petrenko. Give me another 10 days. I study. He's saying that when we meet in Istanbul, I'll teach you a few. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. I'll be waiting for you on Monday.
SPEAKER_00: The lessons can commence. One more time. The lessons can begin on Monday. Oleg, you said that you are expecting a hard match. You said it will not be easy for you and it will not be easy for Devon. Do you see yourself
SPEAKER_00: beating Devon in a tough match or your game plan is only for like explosive pins?
SPEAKER_02: You said it would be a tough match for both you and Larata. Engin asks, do you plan to win in such tough fights, or do you think you will be able to get him to the pillow in such explosive starts? I will try to protect him together and quickly.
SPEAKER_03: But I'm ready for tough, tough fights. I'm ready for that. But as for plan B, first of all, of course, I understand that I will try to finish this match as soon as possible. But I'm ready to fight for a long time.
SPEAKER_02: okay uh yeah oleg is saying that uh for sure i wanna to win fast and you know to finish it as fast as possible uh but uh in preparation he was getting ready for a battle for prolongated matches so that that's what he's been training uh together he's ready for in any case like if he pins quick he pins if not he's gonna battle and he thinks he thinks his endurance is ready for this
SPEAKER_00: uh that's exactly what he said he said plan a is for sure to try to win fast but he was getting ready for plan b for his endurance and prolongated game okay dino says andre he he believed that he was uh the strongest and he says rest in peace and audi james says guys please explain who pushkar was he died before a lot of people found our missing
SPEAKER_00: the East versus West perspective would be interesting. I mean, if he was here, he would be up there with probably top three, but we don't know exactly where he would be. But he would be up there for sure in top five, but I don't exactly know. I don't know what you think, Devon. I think so. Obviously, I'm a massive fan of Andrei Pushkar. I've watched everything. I watched his entire career.
SPEAKER_01: Without question, one of the most distinguished arm wrestlers in history. And I would go so far as to say, perhaps the very most dominant tournament-style super heavyweight that has ever existed. That's what I would say about Andrei Pushkar. And you, Oleg? What do you think? Do you think that's fair? You are asking me?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, do you think that's a fair assessment, what I said? That start, especially like his fresh power, when you say tournament style, because you don't pull the guy over and over, the same guy, once you beat him, if he's the best guy, you flash pin him, he will have to pull other guys and come back to you for the final, and you most likely can do the same way, even though usually Dennis was beating him even in the Zloty Tur tournament.
SPEAKER_00: But still, his start, I would just say that his start from the goal
SPEAKER_00: I think like either you would just find yourself on the pin pad or just a few inches away like some sometimes like Michael did sometimes Dennis did you know but that starts at right at the start I don't remember that many people was able to stop that you know usually he would always take in the center and I don't know what you think but
SPEAKER_01: yeah i i think i think especially does he have the most super heavyweight waft gold medals i think he does yeah yes yes yes yes for sure yeah yeah yeah paulo just before you ask oleg maybe you also share your opinion since you are originally from
SPEAKER_02: same country as Pushkar. Absolutely. I believe that Andrei was one of the most dedicated athletes in the sport. He never took a break as most of the athletes for his entire career.
SPEAKER_02: he was uh always present i would say so and yes uh the most intimidating uh setup and start in a super heavyweight division definitely and uh overall overall top three top five of over from from all the time yeah yeah for sure yeah yeah yeah and when i was out talking about with his opponents about him they were saying that like he was holding them like he's gonna like their
SPEAKER_00: You know, like, like, like he was just doing like, like hammer curling, you know, it was just kind of like, he was not putting back pressure with his riser, but mostly with his grip, you know, and then he was, he was still rising, but he was doing with inside of his hand with that tight grip. And like, either you would give up on your riser or he would just lift your elbow off the pad. You know, he was just that good load into the top, you know, and what does Oleg think?
SPEAKER_02: I will just short comment here from Richard lapkis he uh told you he told me once that that was the most intimidating grip he ever felt on the arm wrestling table from Andre bushcar that's what he said uh okay now I will show the translating a scholar
SPEAKER_02: But we are talking about Andriy Pushkar. Someone asked, tell us a little about Andriy, because some people just came to Armwrestling later, after Andriy passed away. And where did he comment?
SPEAKER_02: The top three or five, if he were with us now, that this is the best start and the best speed in the super heavy division. And that, well, yes, he sometimes lost, Denis managed to stop them, Michael once stopped him somewhere after the start, but it was already very close to the pillow, that is, his start was, well,
SPEAKER_02: He was always at the very top of the world army. I added that he practically never made any interruptions, for some reason he was always present.
SPEAKER_02: I don't remember where he told you that he had the most gold medals in the Wafi World Championships out of all the superweights. How would you comment on Andriy? Andriy is the 14-time world champion and the 16-time European champion in Wafi and the 8-time World Cup among professionals.
SPEAKER_03: And a lot of tournaments besides that. Yes, Andriy is the fastest heavyweight. I think right now he would be at least in the top-3. And it would be hard even for Livan to fight him. Because Andriy has a very good speed, a good start. And I think Andriy would beat Livan and maybe win it.
SPEAKER_02: So I'm saying, yes, 14 times world champion, 16 times European champion, 8 times professional... Zloty probably. Zloty tour champion.
SPEAKER_02: and uh uh he said yes the fastest super heavyweight in the world as of his understanding and he said uh definitely i think top three at the moment if he would be present and uh that even levan would have some issues with his uh start uh style so he said i don't know maybe yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: Andriy had the best form in his life. He said it himself that it was his best form. He had never been in such a form before. Because he was motivated to beat Denis. He lost to him many times before that. And he was very big and very stylish, as far as I remember.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Oleg saying that Andre was in best shape when he was going to that Vendetta. He was in his best shape ever, the biggest, the heaviest, because he was very, very motivated to win with Denis, because he was losing to him many times before, and that motivated him to the edge where he gained his best ever form. Oh, okay. I understand. I have a question right now. I will...
SPEAKER_00: pour a little bit of gas on the fire right now. But I want Oleg to answer me 100% honestly. How did Oleg feel when Devin beat Pushkar and
SPEAKER_00: like with his, like holding him and waiting, how did he see this as a show? Did he, like, does it make Petrenko a bit upset about it?
SPEAKER_02: Engin said that now he will add some gasoline to the fire. I ask Oleg and expect a very sincere answer. How did you feel when you watched the match when Andriy lost and Devon held him in the middle of the table? What were the feelings? Did it make you sad or angry? What did you feel?
SPEAKER_03: It was unpleasant for me. It was unpleasant to see that in front of me. And I felt more angry. He wasn't angry, but he was very confident with himself at the table with Andriy. It was unpleasant for me to see that.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, Oleg's saying that it was very unpleasant feelings that Devon was so dominant and he felt so dominant on the table and it almost was close, it was not humiliation, but it was close to humiliation on the table and he said it was very unpleasant feeling and that was making me angry.
SPEAKER_00: You made him angry. Okay. That's exactly sometimes Devon wants people to feel. That is, I think, why he's also famous. If he would win the matches in a regular way, I think there are some type of people, my opinion, like Muhammad Ali. People were not like, I don't care, either they loved him or they hated him.
SPEAKER_01: So I think Devon is one of those guys that whenever you watch him, either you love him or you dislike, you know, the way he is. And that is probably why he is so popular. Do you agree with Devon or you have different opinion? It's hard to know, but I do hope that young Oleg did draw the observation that this is what I do. And if I'm capable, if I am so lucky,
SPEAKER_01: I will certainly do the same to him and maybe worse. Oh, Oh, look, he should know. He should know. And I hope he's prepared because when the match stops, when the match stops, maybe round one, it's a long night. It's a long night. Um,
SPEAKER_02: Engin says, and we all know that Devon always does this, if he can do it, and that's why he's so popular. And so he says, either people love him or they hate him, as it was with Muhammad Ali, approximately. Then he asked Devon, I think I said it correctly,
SPEAKER_02: You left right now, but inside of you, that possibility, does it not bother you at all?
SPEAKER_03: You're laughing now, but you understand that it's theoretically possible. It's a bit of a scrabble for you, isn't it? Yes, of course, I understand that it can happen. And I understand who I'm fighting with. I know where he leads his opponent when he stops them and when they are already powerless.
SPEAKER_03: That's why I told her that I'm well prepared and ready to fight Devon. And he won't have time to talk behind the table. Because he will have to hold his hand first, so that it doesn't fall into the pillow.
SPEAKER_02: devon uh he understands who is who is he dealing with and he understands that this is yes possible that's why he took this prep very serious and he get himself ready for this and uh he said devon don't think that you will have much time to talk on the table because you will have some things to worry about to hold your arm not to be pinned good good there's nothing that i wish for more than a glorious battle
SPEAKER_01: This is the best case scenario, but he should know that what he has, I want. What he has, I find very valuable and I'm coming for it. And I don't just want to take it from him a little bit. I want to take it so much that he just gives it to me. I want him to quit.
SPEAKER_03: He says, I know what you have. Yes, yes. I'm going to get what you have. And he says, I don't want a little bit there, I want everything together. And I want you to give up the table. Well, I noticed recently that Devon makes a lot of videos, reminds me a lot. And I'm pleased. I see that Devon talks so much about me, he's probably worried. I guess so.
SPEAKER_02: Oleg's saying that, yes, I know. And he also said that lately you was making lots of videos and you often and often talking about me. And he said that, you know, my pleasure. Thank you, Devin. And that means that, yes, you're thinking about me. And yes, you're a little bit worried.
SPEAKER_01: It's true. It's true. Much respect. Much respect to Ukrainian arm wrestling. Much respect to their champion, Oleg Petrenko. Much respect to his teacher, Andrei Pushkar. But that makes it so much more valuable to me. It makes legitimacy. Oleg Petrenko is the legitimate world champion. And that's why I want it so badly. And he has to know that for me...
SPEAKER_01: For me, victory will not be enough. It will not be. I will make him quit. He needs to mentally prepare for the fact that before we are off the table, he will bow to me.
SPEAKER_02: He says, I know, and I have such great respect for you, Oleg, and your teacher, and in general for Ukrainian armwrestling. And because of this, this is a very, very important match for me. And he says, my victory is not enough yet. I want you to give up. Well, I won't give up in any case.
SPEAKER_02: I would say that he is mentally ready and he will not quit anyhow. He is saying that he has big respect for a legend like you and it's very respectful to pull you, but he said, forget it, I will not quit.
SPEAKER_00: I have a question. When Hermes was pulling Devin, they spent a week together. And Hermes after the match, he said that if he pulls Devin again, he's not going to get so much close and involved before the match next time. He won't be spending time with him. And do you plan to spend time with Devin?
SPEAKER_00: and before the event or you want to stay away and concentrate or you don't have any problem with that
SPEAKER_02: Oleh, the last time when Hermes fought with Divan, they spent a lot of time together before the match. They spent almost a week together. And after the match, Hermes said, if I ever fight him again, I don't want to be so close to him. I want to be a little away from him. And Engin asks, do you have any problems with that? Or you don't care and you can just observe yourself?
SPEAKER_03: a little bit of your time on the side to concentrate on the fight. There are no problems with that yet. I can spend time with Devon, but the last day or two I don't want to spend time with Devon, because we communicate as friends, and he is now a rival for me. And I have to have this athletic anger on him, athletic. So I don't want to contact him a lot the last day or two. Hello, hello and good luck.
SPEAKER_02: uh oleg saying that he has no problem to spend a lot of time in the beginning but uh about two days before the actual match he said because we we can chat as a friends but two days before the match uh they have to uh create that you know uh sport build up sports anger and he here and uh you know we can say hi how are you good luck and that's about for the last two days because he want to concentrate on the match
SPEAKER_00: okay okay you don't he doesn't want to get too friendly after like after a few days last two days from thursday to saturday he wants to be distant that is what i realized yeah yeah okay go ahead go ahead i'm sure we will get along great you know monday tuesday wednesday i would love to have supper with you you can eat whatever you like i'll eat a little bit of chicken or something um
SPEAKER_01: thursday is going to be a very difficult day for me same with friday so yeah so that's a great plan for me too and uh that i would love to sit down with you a few times before get to know you a bit better uh get to spend some time with you as we're having this great fight to me that would be wonderful
SPEAKER_02: Devon says, yes, I agree. You can argue with me on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We'll spend some time together, we'll talk. I want to get to know you better. But yes, Thursday and Friday will be very difficult days for me. I completely agree with the plan. Great. I can bring Devon a cake on Thursday evening, if he wants.
SPEAKER_02: Do you say so? Yes, yes. He says, Thursday will be a tough day.
SPEAKER_00: okay there is cd and gas nere insane card engine thanks good luck to all i think devon just lost another pound one pound walking hundred five thousand steps and then north of says that looking forward to november 2nd good luck to both he says ukraine and
SPEAKER_00: and then osman says hi everyone what are oleg's left arm proceeds for the future uh left arm we will talk later this time we talk probably his next match would be someone like alijan for a revenge match but if he loses don't ask me the third match if it is close yes you can but if it is not close then him
SPEAKER_00: so speaking about the left hand and again speaking about the left hand what do you what do you think is anything going to happen at the event left-handed uh no i i want to focus on this much i want to focus on my event nothing not something that is not you don't think your event you don't think it could happen right then no no no no okay you are you are saying that you versus dennis
SPEAKER_00: I'll pull him right after the match, left-handed, right on the stage. He's not going to pull left. Let's focus. Why not? I prepared the best card in history. It's true. I agree. I agree. I want to focus on that one. But I am going to call him out. I will call him out just so you know. Yeah. You did enough. He answered you already.
SPEAKER_01: i'll keep doing it come to me you can pull me left-handed every day and play some sunday yeah yeah yeah hey who's the best is it you or is it uh is it uh fucking oh my god is it uh he just he just uh lost to camille um my good buddy corey yeah corey west hey who's better you or corey right now you got him yeah good
SPEAKER_00: Good. OK. I have a question for Oleg. Oleg, just like if you just go to pad, if your wrist doesn't fail, I believe your side pressure is enough. But just say that if your wrist gets bent, do you have also plan
SPEAKER_00: for a dead risk pressure because your dead risk pressure didn't seem very effective when you play against John. But do you have anything or your game plan is just all about the hand and wrist control?
SPEAKER_02: I have a question for you, Oleh. It is very possible that right from the start, you have a very strong side and a very strong bone. If you break through from the start and go to the pillow, but not far from the pillow, something happens that you slow down and your bone goes away.
SPEAKER_02: Do you have such a plan and such an opportunity that you will go completely into a dead wrist flap? We saw that you did not have such a very effective flap when you were fighting with John. Did you work something out there, or will you still try to drop the bone and make a hook? Of course, I will try not to let the bone fall.
SPEAKER_03: and try a new start, try to pull myself more to the side. Well, I think I'll feel it behind the table, where I can and how. Yes, I am now completely different from when I fought John. First of all, probably mentally. John did such a lesson for me, for which I am very grateful to him. I got a lot of experience with John.
SPEAKER_03: Because of my mistakes that I made. And now I'm much stronger physically. But before that, I'm more technical now, I think. And yes, I can fight like this if I need to. That's what I trained. I said that I know who I'm fighting with. So I'm not going to give up.
SPEAKER_02: okay uh so uh answer was like that yes a game a plan is yes for sure the hand control and the side pressure uh if something like that happening when my wrist start you know i have i have a few plans before uh
SPEAKER_02: yeah he said maybe i will have to fall out or you know just to get to restart the match and try again maybe a little bit more or you know more but if that necessary he said yes i've been training hard and i have developed uh some good progress on the flop wrist and he said technically and mentally after john i got much much better yes for sure yeah
SPEAKER_00: In my opinion, he got at least 30% stronger after that match. Because I think, as far as I remember, that was his first event after 2019. Or maybe during the pandemic, he pulled maybe Raimonds, but Antonovic. But I think he prepared like two, three months before the John match.
SPEAKER_02: And I think, yeah, I think he's much stronger right now. Yeah. Did he add anything else? I cut you, sorry about it. No, no, that was it. That was it. Two months.
SPEAKER_02: How do you think, how much percent? Engin says, I think he's 30% better than what he was with Can.
SPEAKER_03: I think I'm 30% stronger now. Because I weighed 93-94 kg at that time, I quickly gained up to 100-102 kg. And in the first round, just this excess water, I got stuck, and then I didn't hold on to any more. Although, if everyone remembers, in the first round, I controlled the fight quite a bit. I could do it in the hook and in the top.
SPEAKER_03: I think it was John who pushed me to give up. It's his merit, after all.
SPEAKER_02: so yeah all the commented short yes he only has a two months uh for prep and he said yeah i've been trying to gain uh as much power as possible i was only 93 kilos and gained to 100 very fast so all this water and carbs uh was in the way and john pushed me to you know to pump very fast and he said yes
SPEAKER_02: it's credit to john it's not because i was bad and pumped up that's because of john pushed me that way so he understand that and he said i pumped up and the first round it was not bad and he was yeah yeah yeah yeah and he said yeah my uh was flopping and it was silly so but he said yes you're right engine i'm about 30 better right now stronger okay okay very quick dino says quit patrianka quit quit and talk to flintstone
SPEAKER_00: and last comps says top five arm masters of all time good luck guys the hamster says everybody devon walks off the off he adds to his pronation so your pronunciation is getting stronger when you're walking and fanatic system says the hands let them compare do devon a favor
SPEAKER_01: I think they want to see your hands. Can you show your hand Oleg? That's not that small either, but it's smaller than Devon's for sure. Yeah. You know, can I just add that I'm thankful for this podcast because now Oleg has given me enough that I now am a hundred percent sure of my victory. I wasn't so sure before.
SPEAKER_01: But now I see some of his issues and I already believe that now knowing what I know about Oleg, the victory is very surely mine. Very surely. What are those issues, if I can ask? Well, I think that so much of becoming a champion is having a very accurate assessment of both your and your opponent's capabilities.
SPEAKER_01: And I don't think he quite has that. And because of that, he is going to play his cards wrong. And it's I listen, maybe you will have some enlightenment over the next few days. But thank you. Thank you for your contribution. Thank you so much. I suspect that I will still be able to teach you and I will be able to add to your greatness in a meaningful way.
SPEAKER_02: Where he says, thank you very much for being on the podcast. Now I am sure that I will win. Now I know for sure that I will be the winner. Engin asks, why? He says, because I saw that there are two most important moments of a winner. That he knows his capabilities and the capabilities of his opponent.
SPEAKER_02: exactly determined where and how and what to do in order to win. He says, I think that Oleg did not determine everything clearly in these two moments, and I think that I will be able to teach him and make such a contribution to his greatness as an armwrestler. Thank you very much. Well, okay, let him think, but the next day he will come
SPEAKER_03: And he will confirm my words that 105 is not his category, I think. And that's why he will lose. And he will come to him every day and say, yes, friend, this is not my category. If he weighed 115, I would understand that it would not be easy with him. But at 105, I think the victory will be with me. Because this is not his category.
SPEAKER_02: oleg is saying that yeah it's great that you may think that way but uh he believes that next day after match you will come to him and say my friend you was right 105 class is yours and not mine maybe maybe but i've been doing this a very long time and i know i know very clearly that a lot of people a lot of people talk trash
SPEAKER_01: A lot of people throw out inaccuracies a little bit here and there to see what their opponents will say. But I believe that Oleg is not like that. I believe that Oleg says the truth. And I believe that he speaks, he speaks exactly what he thinks will happen. And if this is the case,
SPEAKER_01: he will lose. If he's just talking some trash, that's fine. It's going to be maybe a good match. But if you actually believe the things that you've said, you will lose very, very badly and early. And I like Oleg. I do. But this remains the fact that there's a strong likelihood that if he plays his cards the way he says he will,
SPEAKER_00: It will be a long night for him. Pablo, before you translate, can you also add that does Oleg think that Devon believes in what he says or he's doing some mind trick to intimidate him? I'll just tell you it's 100% the truth.
SPEAKER_01: no no you you know it too you're you're asking nobody listen there is nobody is better than you about just getting into your opponent's head you know it's not that it's not that i do it and it's just the truth and everybody becomes aware of it i'm just saying the truth i'm not talking trash i'm not getting in your head it's the truth i'm just telling you what's going to happen and i already know it we all know you said that you know it you know it
SPEAKER_01: Pablo knows it. Even Oleg knows it. We all know that I'm going to beat him. We all know that by the end of round one, the story will probably be over. And that's fine. You know it. Devin, why you cut all the time? You said that.
SPEAKER_01: He says the truth. He says that next day you will go to him and you will tell him that, and then you said that he's the best 105 kg, you were right, Patron, this is what he said. And you said that he says the truth. No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, yeah, so that's what he thinks. And I'm telling him that if that's actually what he thinks, it will be a long night for him. And I'm not just about what he said just in the last little bit. What he said this whole podcast and the way he's spoken...
SPEAKER_01: in the way he says his strengths are, in the way he says things that he will and he won't do, these have all led me to the conclusion that it will be a horrible night for him. Because it's just not how you play the game. There is a game, there is a way that you play it, and he should know who he is and he should know who I am. I can't wait for him to make mistakes. I can't wait. Okay, you translate and let's see what Oleg says because he looks curious.
SPEAKER_02: Do you guys want me to translate when you've been both talking together too? I mean, whatever you would like to, because we trust you. I mean, for sure, they will also trust you. Oleg, so Larad says that he knows and he believes that what you are saying today on the podcast is about the truth. That many people can sometimes do trash talk and some garbage, you know, pollute the air. He says, I don't think Oleg did it. I think Oleg practically told the truth.
SPEAKER_02: I think Oleg will lose because of the priorities he set. If he doesn't tell the truth and has something else in his hands, then maybe not.
SPEAKER_02: From what I heard, it will be a very, very long and difficult evening for you when the fight takes place. And Engin immediately asked, ask, says Oleg, does Oleg think that today Devon was telling the truth on this podcast, or did he specifically pour a little again, just to get into your head and scare you a little? Well, of course, I think Devon is not telling the truth and wants to get me out of it somehow.
SPEAKER_03: But I've been watching Devon for the last month or two, he's been recording videos, and I like it. He talks so much, like he's going to beat me, he's going to stop me. I like it. I wanted Devon to continue.
SPEAKER_02: Oleg's saying that, yes, he was saying the truth, and he probably has something else besides what he said, but he also said that, you know what, that's answer to your ending question.
SPEAKER_02: He said for sure that Devon was not saying only truth during today's podcast. And for sure he was getting into my head a little bit or trying to do so. And he said, but I want to tell you something that I've been very closely following Devon's videos for last month or so. And he said, I love it. I love it, Devon. Continue to do it. It's very, very pleasant for me that you're doing this. Very good.
SPEAKER_00: very good we will have a glorious night i have a question uh oleg we normally see you like very respectful very kind at the table until your daddy can match during the daddy can match
SPEAKER_00: You know, Dadecan is generally aggressive at the table. You know, his personality, like aggressive. Except his Tata Chings match. They both were very friendly in that match. But during the Dadecan match, you also were aggressive. And how do you think that your behavior will be against Devin? Like the way that you were against Tata Chings or the way that you were against Dadecan?
SPEAKER_02: I have a question. Usually, you behave behind the table in a very restrained manner and with respect. And only when you had a match with Dadikyan, you were more serious and aggressive. And Dadikyan, on the other hand, is known for being aggressive. And he behaves aggressively behind the table. And Engin asks,
SPEAKER_03: What are the settings in your head and how do you plan to behave behind the table, behind the LARAT? Strictly or aggressively? I usually don't plan it in advance. It comes out during the match on its own. I think Devon will have a calm match, because I'm not going to listen to Devon. And I don't understand half of what he says. That's good.
SPEAKER_03: So I think it will be a tough match for me and I won't show aggression. But if I need to, I can do it at any time.
SPEAKER_02: Well, the answer was like this. He thinks that it's going to be a very calm match with Devon. And he said, listen, I'm not really planning to listen to Devon, especially I don't understand like half of what he's saying, which is beneficial for me probably.
SPEAKER_02: and he also said that uh i'm not planning things like be aggressive or become uh and humble at the table it's not something that i plan ahead of times it usually comes as necessary naturally you know however he feels yes and uh he said it's very possible that my you know spark will you know
SPEAKER_00: circuit breaker will come short and i will be aggressive i i cannot answer this question okay he doesn't plan that but he thinks that there is a possibility for that yeah but he believes it's gonna be a very humble and uh calm match okay and then two superchats jack nichols or jay nichols this is solely for pushkars memory my god rest in heaven he says and then and then lars says devon
SPEAKER_01: Are you a caffeine user? Yeah, I use caffeine. Yeah. Not right now. Not right now. And I'll use caffeine a lot of times. I'll use it in a match. But yeah, caffeine is great. The hamster says, Oleg and Devin, who can do more pull-ups and push-ups? Oleg wins. Easy.
SPEAKER_00: Easy. I can do nothing now. I am an old, fragile guy. I can arm wrestle still really good. But all my push-up days and pull-up days are behind me. When I was young, I was very good. But no, not now. And then we missed one super chat where they were saying that your top five all-time arm wrestlers are probably the super heavyweight, the strongest one. And you put first Levan probably, right? This is what you're saying.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah you guys want to go there or you guys want to continue talking about match however you guys i think that one is frozen yeah it's frozen and okay let's talk with you probably what is what is your opinion paulo about this match
SPEAKER_02: This match I want to see. As Oleg said, if it would be 115 kg, I don't want to see this match yet. I would give it another two years. But at 105, I believe that this is one of the closest matches you ever set up.
SPEAKER_02: this card is very good but this match is uh extremely interesting for me personally because uh I pulled Devon before uh at the practices and uh you know a few times and I pulled uh Oleg after pool I know where they at and Oleg was not there when I you know after pull him so uh
SPEAKER_02: as i predicted before i believe because because this is six round super match that i believe that devon will pull the win on a silver bullet like four three or something similar to this uh because of the endurance but i believe oleg at this shape that this shape may prove me wrong okay just so can you uh remind me did did uh
SPEAKER_00: you guys see me yes yes yeah i do yeah and uh okay like oleg looks frozen no oleg is okay oleg is okay okay he doesn't move yeah okay i thought he was after frozen okay yeah um what was i gonna say yeah okay i i forgot that part can you remind me did he say that his shape right now is better than ongar by a match
SPEAKER_00: Yes, On Gorbaev was best shape before this, but this shape is much better than On Gorbaev shape. Yes. Can you ask him specifically what does he mean by much better? Because little bit better, I understand much better. Since June to November is only five months. Like how much?
SPEAKER_02: What does it mean? Oleg, one more question. Between what you showed in the fight with Onagrabaev and now, what do you think is the difference in percentage of your form? I think it depends on the situation, from 5% to 10%.
SPEAKER_03: For example, for such basic exercises, such as push-ups, I can do 200 on one, now I can do 200 on three. I can lift more on the biceps, on 10 kilograms, for the same number of repetitions. I opened up new exercises for myself, this is for the withdrawal, for the bone, isolated. I added very well there, but these are new exercises, I am only preparing for Nagrabaev.
SPEAKER_03: Because I understood that with Nagrabayev I was not expecting blows on the fingers, on the wrist. That's what I focused on. And in this I added well. And now to Devon, in principle, I also expect that he will include his pronator and will load me on the wrist. That's why I prepared for this very well. And in those exercises I added the most. In general, I became bigger, stronger.
SPEAKER_02: uh so alex saying that in all aspects he's better uh if you're talking uh gym lifts uh there uh which is measurable uh he depends on the exercise he's between five and ten percent better uh compared to anger by f he said
SPEAKER_02: i don't know how to you know explain it but let's say bench press he used to bench 200 kgs for one now he can do it for three uh bicep curls he added the 10 kgs his endurance is much better than it used to be for for underbite he found a new exercises which is very well fit for him for uh riser and for cupping
SPEAKER_02: He said there in new exercises gains for us was amazing. And he said, yeah, I understand it's like a new big gains because I, you know, used to technique and stuff like that. But that's what he's concentrated on and he see real growth in those exercises. And he said, yes, I understood that arm wrestling with Zongarbaev will be mostly...
SPEAKER_02: uh hits fingers in the wrist and he understands the Devon's concept of arm wrestling and he understands that's most likely Devon will use most of his pronation and it's gonna be yeah majority of arm wrestling can hand control in the wrist so he said that basically five to ten percent with the weight is stronger so basically he's saying that Devon is in trouble
SPEAKER_02: And he is saying the next day Devon is going to come and shake his hand and say that you are still the man. This is what he says. Yes. Am I provoking you enough, Devon? No, no, not enough. And if I would translate not only the words and a little bit of expression and intonation, I would say, Devon, you fucked, buddy.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, come on. Pavel, do you really think that? My thing had cut out. I couldn't hear actually what you were saying about what you thought the match. Do you really think he's going to beat me? No, he says that Pavel says that Petrenko says this. I know that Petrenko says it, but Pavel, do you really think this guy can beat me? I predicted that you're going to win in 4-3.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. So close match, close match. Pablo, that was before Petrenko told you that he was 5% to 10% stronger. Now you can edit your prediction. No, I will not edit this. I still think that way. But there is, Devin, get ready. There is very possible. Listen, listen. I have a full grasp.
SPEAKER_01: of how difficult it is to win a belt in a weight division at East versus West. I know that it's different. You need to be perfect. You need to be perfect at that weight. The advantage that I have is that if I do a successful cut, I will be bigger than him. And that is gonna be hard to deal with for him. Yes, he's strong. He's super strong. It's just that I'm 6'5".
SPEAKER_02: That's that's my prediction. Where is this? You know, if you would be six one, like me, and you know, I would say no, no, no, no way. But because of you are who you are. That's why my predictions there. I think it's my I think 115 is easier. You know what, I'm gonna tell you some Paolo, in my opinion, 105 is my best class.
SPEAKER_00: It is. I remember you in 102.5. When was the weigh-in for the WAL before the match? How long was it before? Same as East vs. West, maybe a few hours less, but between 36 and 24.
SPEAKER_00: okay okay but would you say that 105 was your best category if the weigh-in was the morning of the competition oh okay hold on hold on morning of the competition this would be new for me i don't know if it was if it was okay you don't know you don't know okay yeah this would be something new so look it i am gonna need that time
SPEAKER_00: Right. I'm just saying if it was different organization, would you still think that, or because of the 36 hours, but the people needs to understand people think that like sometimes, oh, why you give advantage? It is, this is how we started. 36 hours for me, 36 hours for me is good.
SPEAKER_01: is good less would be more in oleg's favor right like if we had to weigh in at the match at that weight it's going to be massively in oleg's favor but because we have this weigh-in capacity it gives me the ability to go way down and come back up and this is going to be hard for him to deal with and this is why i might even be able to do 95 one day no yes no
SPEAKER_00: Why are you saying no? Why are you saying no? You still have 12 kilos to lose to 105. Just imagine that. Just imagine that the moment that you made 105, if you can make, and imagine that you still had 10 kilos more. You will be totally exhausted. And just remember, like 95 kilos, I mean, the winner of the 95 kilos, as of now, is not the champion of the 95 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: It's not too far from the 105 champion, in my opinion. I mean, like Oleg would be probably better, but not like super easy domination. So like you're going to lose 95 kilos, you would have a heart attack. You would have arms. So then both categories are easy for me because Oleg's going to be easy. So that means who? Irakli's easy too? Listen, what I'm just saying that you need to lose 10 more kilos. No problem.
SPEAKER_00: Beating Oleg at 105 kilos easy is like inconsistent because a while ago you were saying there was going to be war for both of you. That's what you call fake humility. Okay. It's like the opposite of trash talk. More gas on the fire. No, no, no. It's me being nice. Me saying, look, I hope it's a war. I hope it's close.
SPEAKER_01: But we all know that the possibility of a first round blowout is entirely possible, entirely possible. And it's just as possible as it it's a war. We hope it's a war, but the chance that it's a blowout is much higher than the chance that he demolishes me. And if I can beat him, I will most certainly make it ugly.
SPEAKER_02: Let me translate, because I will forget everything. Go ahead. Oleg, I will shorten it, because there are a lot of trends. In short, Devon says, what are my advantages? I am bigger by a lot, higher, and you have to agree with that. He says, yes, I understand that it's not easy, of course, but I am bigger, higher, and you understand that I will not be 105.
SPEAKER_02: I will be much more, because I am 15 years old. So it's true. Then Engin asked what were
SPEAKER_02: He said that if I had to weigh myself every day, it would be a big advantage for Oleg and a disadvantage for me.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if it was a joke, I can't understand his intonation, if he's joking or if he's seriously saying it. He says, when I beat Oleg, I'll finish in 95.
SPEAKER_02: We say to Engin, that you are already in trouble, what 95 is, it's another 10 from 105, you are already dying there. And he says, no, I can do everything and I will give up. Then Engin says, listen, there are rattles. They can fight with Oleg, Oleg is probably sure that he will win, but there is not even such a colossal difference between them in strength and in general. He says, if you get into 95, then you will have a bag of
SPEAKER_02: You'll have a heart attack. You don't need it. He said, no, I can do it. I said, OK, you can do it. And we started talking again. We got back to what he said. He said, listen, I hope it will be a close match. But he said, if I kill him in the first match, it won't be very good. I said, you know, it will look a little bad afterwards. I said, OK, guys, stop.
SPEAKER_02: yes my phone's on 15 you're oh okay engine his phone on 15 you have five more minutes at the most engine what what devon's phone at 15 we have about five minutes until his phone will die yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean anyways yeah so yeah i want to just
SPEAKER_00: read a few superchats and five dollar shake devon please rehydrate with an iv after the cut yeah that's the plan yeah and hey listen you need to explain to me you you will need that on thursday no friday friday you will need right as soon as i weigh in a few things you wrote i didn't understand you need to explain i'll clarify i'll clarify yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: Nathan Thompson says, Engin, how would you feel about East-West Supermatch tournament taking place over multiple events instead of just one day like a regular tournament for months? I didn't understand, but I think I'm happy with what I'm doing right now.
SPEAKER_00: And then, because people get upset if I don't, he says, glory to Canada, glory to Ukraine, north of 55, he says. And Josh says, Devon, any concerns about your arm getting too pumped after such a drastic water cut and then re-carving after the weigh-in? Yeah, there's moderate concerns there. There are. It's certainly something to thought about.
SPEAKER_00: There are many factors, many things to balance and yes, over-hydration, getting over-pumped is certainly an issue. Yeah, I've thought about it and I'm aware of it. Okay, NorthOx says, keep walking Devon, 10 more kg to go. How much stronger is Oleg's press than versus John? His press, how much does he think that is stronger compared to the time that he pulled against John?
SPEAKER_02: He was working on it pretty hard, 15-20% at least. Okay, this is Henry Naring asks, Nathan, Paolo, how do you think their styles match up?
SPEAKER_02: stylistically with devon everybody match up very badly okay i didn't match nobody match with devon good because his uh his styles are match
SPEAKER_02: the worst that you can provide you know if if let's say if my riser is the worst devon will attack my riser his feeling on the table is uh amazing and he knows are you the worst so stylistically for oleg this is a very bad matchup that's what i was but it's not especially for him but you are saying for everyone
SPEAKER_00: Or basically everyone, unless it's giants like Levan or Vitaly, very tall guys, probably having easier matchup to Devon's arm than everybody else. Okay, Fanatic System says, people forget that Devon being 105 kg doesn't change the fact that his right arm alone weighs 35 kg. And then, guys, try not to send more Super Chat because we are going to...
SPEAKER_00: uh finish the podcast and guys you guys i don't know i see that both of you are ready uh and do you guys have one last message uh for each other i understood personally everything
SPEAKER_00: what they are saying, what is their motivation. Devon is probably going like a few reasons because Oleg being like East versus West is representing true world champion and Oleg is that person and Devon believes that like beating the very best is the satisfaction and motivation and him being Pushkar's student is also making it more meaningful. If I misunderstood, you can correct me Devon. And then
SPEAKER_00: and then he wants to he he already won world title at the east versus west that's very impressive because east versus west is the toughest league ever and the arm wrestling has never been at this level and already winning super heavyweight permanent belt and then already having 105 15 kg belt by beating brudnick and now he is
SPEAKER_01: pulling for the third category this is a historical thing if it can be successful uh am i right with my understanding or you want to no that's that's all really good what you said and i agree really i mean if we're starting to wrap this thing up what i really want to leave oleg with is just hold on to the belt sleep with it
SPEAKER_01: Keep it close to you this next little bit, because for the next five years, you will never get it back at 105. Best recommendation, go down to 95 kilo. Okay. And, and maybe, maybe next time I get really skinny, I'll come and take your belt at 95 also.
SPEAKER_02: Oleg, Engin summed up what Larratt said, that it is very important for him to win this belt. And why is it very important? Because he says, well, the teacher once won, and now the student needs to win. And plus, historically, it will be his third belt in the third category, and this is also important for him.
SPEAKER_02: I asked him if it was all right. He said yes, but he wanted to add something. He said it was especially for Oleg. He said take the belt, sleep with it a little bit, because it may very well be that I will win and take it. After that, he said, I highly recommend dropping off at 95, winning the belt there, so that he believes that you will do it. And he said, you will sit there with the belt until I lose weight very strongly and become very thin. I will come, he said, and take the belt from you at 95.
SPEAKER_02: you're saying that like it's some kind of a joke man this is this is serious you think i'm joking i'm not joking i'm sorry it's it's it's very serious stuff but i am a translator and i'm translating the words but i understand uh also the roots of the words and it's making me laugh because i'm happy okay okay
SPEAKER_02: I can let him wear it for half a day so that he can look at it from afar. And that's it. So, Devo, sorry, but not this time. Devo, he said no problem. He can give it to you for half a day. You can wear it for half a day. He is not planning to give it to you permanently. At least not this time. Oh, that's great. Okay, I'm at 5%. My phone is officially going to die in two seconds.
SPEAKER_01: hey thank you guys i can't wait thank you so much we'll see you guys soon we'll see you guys very soon i look forward to having supper with you sitting down pablo i'm coming for the left hand belt too i'm coming for you in north america just so you know it's going to be a big problem for you i'll be ready for you buddy uh paulo i just want him to answer shortly devon did his best with that all these like
SPEAKER_00: intimidation you know and everything just prepare him that i'm gonna beat you you go 95 i will still beat you and and things like that like at the end of the podcast how much was oleg intimidated
SPEAKER_02: Oleg, Varad did everything to get into your head, to scare you a little bit, to tell you that he will win 105 and then 95. At the end of this podcast, how do you feel and how scared are you now? I feel great, I say that I like it, it's a match from Devon.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know how much of a headache I can get, but now I feel ready. And now I have some thoughts on how I'm going to fight, not where to listen. I think I'm okay. Maybe that's what motivates me the most.
SPEAKER_02: Oleg's saying that he's very absolutely fine and he likes how Devon trying to, you know, intimidate him or get into his head. That doesn't bother him at all at the moment. And he likes it overall when, you know, we spice up things a little bit. And he believes that even, that things even motivating him a little bit more. And he's ready and he's mostly thinking about
