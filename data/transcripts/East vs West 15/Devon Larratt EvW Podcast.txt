SPEAKER_03: Hmm.
SPEAKER_03: Hey, now, yeah. You see me well? Do you see me?
SPEAKER_04: Yes. Do you see me? Can you hear me? Yes. I see you. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And I think everyone now sees. Okay. Now is working. Yeah. How you been? How you been hanging? Uh, tired. No, I don't know why, but people thought that people thought that I was having imaginary conversation because they didn't hear you.
SPEAKER_04: That YouTube connection thing doesn't always work for me either. Yeah. This is probably the first time happening. You know what happened? I also invited Reno and Reno said that he is in the gym and, and I said, okay, so I did one-on-one because on YouTube, you cannot do more than two people. And then he said, oh, Engin, can I join from gym? And I said, it's too late because there was only five minutes. And I said, I already started. And now.
SPEAKER_04: I did the Zoom, so I also sent him the link. Oh, that's great. That's great. I've never spoken to Reno. Did you know that? You're joking, man. I've sent him messages and stuff, like I've talked to him. You've never seen him at the East Versus Fest? You've never met each other at the East Versus? Oh. Wow, that's interesting. So in the events that he was, you were not. And in the events that you were, he was not.
SPEAKER_01: I'm a huge fan. I'm a huge fan of Reno, but I've never actually met Reno, shook his hand. No, not. That's interesting. He's got a big mouth coming up.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That is interesting match. Like I really need to talk with the referees and make sure that both sides keep their shoulders at their side, you know, and otherwise I don't want them to hit their head to each other. Speak of the devil. He came. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you guys hear me? Is it OK?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, gotcha. Yeah. Nice. Nice. I'm gonna thank you for inviting me by the way. I'm in the gym right now. Oh, good for you. Good for you. Preparing a little bit for getting ready. Wow. Wow. What a match. What a match.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah 20 years old on your way to the 115 kilo world title huh yeah it's a it's always funny to me when i think about like uh it's my third time on east west and i already got a second title match two title shots yeah yeah yeah but listen it is not because somebody is giving you favor you are just going and winning the world so yeah yeah i understand i understand
SPEAKER_02: but it's always uh cool to think about that i just want to get this tripod so i can maybe be seen a little bit better yeah so uh so we're on the same card then you know
SPEAKER_02: Finally, I was at East versus West 12, but you were quite busy with everything that you were doing. So unfortunately, we didn't have a chance to speak. But this time, I hope we will. Yeah. Yeah. I'd love that. Yeah. Your name comes out of our mouths around here a lot. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You know, that's crazy for me to hear. It was something that I was just recently, you know, dreaming about and only thinking that it, you know, it's never going to happen. But here we are, you know, it's a dream come true. If like during the training or something, if Leonidas would get injured,
SPEAKER_04: Reno was ready to replace him. Yeah. Yeah. No problem. Yeah. Yeah. I asked him, I asked him, you know, like, would you replace if something would happen? And he said, it would be very unfair to Devon, you know, before, before, before Petlenko match. And yeah, he said that he wouldn't want him to, you, he wouldn't want you to have a left arm injury. So it would affect your training with right arm.
SPEAKER_02: That would just make me stronger. Yeah, you would have to get another tattoo of a rhino on your left arm. Maybe, maybe. Do you want me to hold my phone like vertical or like this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean the side way. Like this? This is okay? Okay, let me just set it up.
SPEAKER_04: But I will tell you something, Devon. For left arm, stylistically, Reno would be a good opponent for you. Because you are master of taking hand, and he doesn't really care if he has it or not. I see that. I see that. Yeah. Well, I think if things keep going the way they're going, there's a collision set for us, I'm sure. Yes.
SPEAKER_01: there's a chance there's a chance that i'm the 105 kilo guy and there's a chance that you're the 115 kilo guy yeah yeah oh yeah yeah is this is this good this looks good nice yeah and uh
SPEAKER_01: And I'll tell you, I would definitely come up and say hello. Definitely. You know, before you get way too strong. You know, you at 20 is probably better than you at 23. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I mean, I don't know what the future holds, but I would definitely like to have the match earlier as well than later. Yes, yes. You wouldn't want to beat a really old Devon, you know.
SPEAKER_02: yeah old and frail a week devon is not really something i would like to go against i might i might still i might still have a lot of miles in me i might might not be in the end i'm sure i'm sure it isn't you got a lot more in you than we would ever expect i think we will see we will see but
SPEAKER_01: already in my mind already in my mind i thought you have a hard match a hard match but it's a world title match and you you might win it you might win it i will win it that's good that's good mindset yeah i think that's a good good move against sagan
SPEAKER_02: I think that, I think you're going to need all that. I think you're going to need it. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I know. I, this is the first time that I actually adjusted my training program ever, ever to anyone. Uh, but I, I adjusted just slightly, just slightly. And it's not something that I will only be doing now. It's the change will be permanent. So it's just an improvement on a side pressure exercise that I'm doing. But, um,
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's the first time that somebody actually made me change my program and think about it a little bit differently. I couldn't believe Segoff grabbing Chance Shaw so low, even round one. I kind of expected that, honestly. Just stylistically, I immediately kind of figured that...
SPEAKER_02: um chance is uh going to like suit sagov style you know inside puller and um he can really get in super tight with his shoulder i don't understand how he does that it's uh it's a mystery to me but i i immediately knew that chance is going to lose that match usually people who goes inside is good for chance you know until now pop tried that he lost his wrist and everything he had a long match
SPEAKER_04: Zurab tried, it didn't work. Arabuli beat him, but Arabuli had to beat him with the dead wrist. But usually, it is very, very hard to get a chance inside. Yeah, but I think the difference is these guys were trying to hook him, right? Except Arabuli, yeah. And this was a press. There's a difference here, I think. Yeah, but he also curled with his wrist. He wasn't like this.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah i mean basically he first hook him and then press him yes yes yes he goes inside and then i i don't know i when i watched some of his matches on amc it was incredible i mean uh he's super super strong i mean uh it's going to be definitely tough but i think i i have i have something planned so we'll see how it works how it will work out you know it will be a very very tough match for both of you
SPEAKER_04: Devon, how would you rank East vs. West 15 card from 10? 11. How do you get better than 9 world title matches? And all of them were well-deserved matches, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: this is incredible i you know what i i made a little video the other day you know and i've made i feel like i've made this video over and over i feel like this is the third or fourth time i've made the video arm wrestling is incredible right now it's incredible look at this event look at this event and and look at how things become more and more clear like the champions and the god yeah that was the vision my friend that was the goal
SPEAKER_04: I was I hate it I hate it on social media for like 20 years everyone is saying this guy is the best this guy's and they never meet each other all those imaginary polls and now we know who is where and that is all I really wanted yeah um there are there are two super chats um like
SPEAKER_04: If I compete again, Devon, where do you think I should compete? 85 kilo or 77 kilo? I'm not 92 kilo. I'm not that good about the water cut that you are doing. I never tried that one. I think everybody wants to see you at 85, but I think that... I don't... It is impossible to beat Samusha there. Really hard. It's really hard. To beat Samusha right now is... All the champions...
SPEAKER_01: are they all look so incredible to me like from Lavon to Simusha everybody in between I mean and and I feel like even the women's champions are starting to you know really stand out I I was saying uh I think it might be harder to beat uh Barbora than it is to beat Lavon it might be yeah but Barbora Barbora is just like one of those
SPEAKER_04: Like they comes like once in every 30 years or something type of girl. Right. Yeah, we have great champions now. Great champions in East versus West. Yeah, everything is going well, everything. And what do you guys think? What is the toughest category in your opinion? Man, that 85 kilo glass with some motion is insane.
SPEAKER_01: It's great. Like, for me, like, look at whoever, like, all the classes are hard. 85 Samusha is tough. I mean, he's got 11. No, 10. This will be his 10th, right? Yeah. I mean, I organized 50-15 events, and this is Samusha's 11th match.
SPEAKER_01: 11. He's pulling 11 times in 15 times total. Oh my God. That's hard to argue with. You know, when a guy's defending his title 10 times, you know, that's a lot of dominance. That means he's gone through 10 guys who we thought could maybe... Nine times. One time he lost Pauline, but he was different category. Paul was heavier, yeah. There's no safe space.
SPEAKER_04: I will tell you something. Yesterday I watched you with Neil's program. You said that this time will be even easier against Mairo. Just mark my word. I don't know who's going to win, but it will be very, very, very hard match. Just mark my word. You will be there. You will watch the match. It will be very hard. I'm not saying Mairo will win. I'm not saying Samusha is going to win, but
SPEAKER_01: that match will be very very hard you know and you're probably right but what i've seen is i've seen samusha kind of okay he's the champion of the class all right it's 85 kilo and here's another point here's another point here's another point and and i feel like the opponents have gotten harder and harder like the the thing with sasho i feel like that was like a pinnacle
SPEAKER_01: Like the match with him and Sasho, for one, it was such an incredible match, such an incredible test against such a clear champion. Like Sasho Andreev, like everybody knows, like this guy is probably going to, he's a total champion. And to win that war, to win that battle,
SPEAKER_04: Devon, Devon, the details are very important. Sasho is incredible in side pressure and his wrist very hard to top roll, but his wrist is not like really crashing and dominating the pronator with the only wrist. It is more like side pressure and he's crashing. This guy, Mairo, he curls your pronator like till the end. And in my opinion,
SPEAKER_04: The only way to beat Samusha is having super control over his pronator. That is the only way. You take his wrist, you leave his pronator, he's going to beat you that way, this way, in every way. The only way is just to make his pronator totally dominated. And this guy, do you remember his match with Adam Orzinski? I'm not comparing Adam with David, but just if you remember, he is really...
SPEAKER_04: controlling the pronators. So this will be very hard match. That guy last time had only two months training after five years. And the last match that he won five years ago was he was first. Second place was Bojidar. Third was Plamen. Fourth was Irakli Zrakashvili. And fifth was Vladislav Krasovskis. So he beat all of them. Left arm he lost only against Oleg Zok. But in the same event Oleg Zok beat Andrei Pushkar. So it was like really pinnacle match.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think about Mairo Reno? I haven't had the chance to really look at some of his matches, but just looking at him physically, he looks absolutely incredible. His forearm is absolutely huge and his hands and wrists as well. Did you see his practice video with Leonidas?
SPEAKER_04: uh no i did not you did not say that very no no no left arm no okay and uh who won who won um there is a super jet arm wrestling betola devon is out and coming with you can we buy t-shirts at hotel um as far as buying t-shirts
SPEAKER_04: You can buy King of the Table t-shirts. Yeah. And Arden is of course coming because he has a supermatch. Yeah. Arden versus Korean Hulk. It's going to be incredible. I can't wait. Dino says, greetings from Croatia. Reno, Engin, and Devon, greetings to Croatia. Yeah, yeah. And Reno, what did you think about the full card of the East Coast West 15th?
SPEAKER_02: Did you like it? Yes, yes. Incredible. Yeah. As soon as I saw the when it was just being announced and as soon as I saw the like teaser for Muratov against Ivan, I knew the car is going to be, you know, killer. It's going to be sick.
SPEAKER_02: uh that that match has interested me for so long i was very i was very interested in it and uh just that match alone makes the card so so super interesting to me let alone like having all of these other matches i think this is definitely one of the best if not the best cards of east versus west so far for sure yeah and what was your favorite match my favorite match is gennady versus michael
SPEAKER_04: I mean, for some reason, it is not a title match and it just makes the event even more beautiful. Even the non-title matches is Gennady vs. Michael and Laletin vs. Desano. Like these are like not world title matches and look at the level, you know, just like... Yes, yes, incredible. Honestly, my favorite match is, as I said, Muratov against Ivan, but...
SPEAKER_02: I was hanging out with Gennady when we were at Worlds in Moldova. He looked pretty good, but I don't know how he looked before. I think that Michael might have a better shot at beating Gennady this time than ever before. I don't know if he recovered fully from his injury. I just don't think he's the same Gennady that he was.
SPEAKER_02: before prior to the injury yeah but he's still he's still a little bit more than two months yes yes i understand but uh when when i mean when we were in moldova he he looked you know a little bit smaller than than he used to look that's why i have like michael for the favorite in my head i think michael has a great shot at beating uh gennady this time
SPEAKER_02: There is a super chat for you. Dino is asking, would Reno pull Alijan at 105? At 105? Maybe I would, but... You prefer 115? Yeah, 115 would be a lot better for me, honestly. 105, cutting to that weight is kind of difficult for me. I'm finding it difficult to
SPEAKER_02: keep my weight under 120 kilos let alone you know cutting to 105 so 115 would be a lot better and i definitely need more time to even you know start thinking about the alijan for me he's just super super strong kind of scary scary strong you know
SPEAKER_02: Did you see the video today Alijan shared? Is it real? He went on the scale, he was like 120? Yeah, yeah, I saw that. He's probably playing with us, I don't think he can be 120. I don't know, I don't know either, you know. It's crazy for me to think about him being so heavy. His normal weight is 105, 110 maximum. Sometimes even 103 kilos, and 120 is too heavy, you know. This could be definitely some kind of a prank, you know.
SPEAKER_04: ArmrestingBitola says, I meant for East vs. West 15. Can't wait to meet you, Devon Engin. Oh, okay. He's going to meet you. No, I don't think Alden is coming. I think Jody is coming with Devon. Yeah, East vs. West 15, probably just Jody. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is interesting. Devon, you right now don't have the
SPEAKER_04: East versus West super heavyweight title. But you have won three title matches there, right? You beat Ermes, you beat Denis, and you beat Georgi Svetko. So you are one of those three title belt holder, not holder, the owners permanently. And you also won 115 kilos against Brutnik.
SPEAKER_04: And even like you don't do this at the same time, if you win 105, then you will be a person that is like winning three East versus West world categories, you know, world titles in three different categories. So I will tell you my opinion. It's not because I'm the organizer of the East versus West, but the world title, professional world title has never been this
SPEAKER_04: You understand that title being because of the level of the event and all the East and West being in the same league and doing this in three different categories, it doesn't have to be in the same time. It's a really big thing to do. But can you?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think so. I'm pretty sure, yeah. I think so. I got a ton of respect for Oleg Petrenko's abilities. I think he's a fantastic arm wrestler. I think he's super strong. I think he's, you know, Pushkar's student. I think he arm wrestles wonderfully. But I do think that I'm the favorite. I do. I think that I'm going to cause him a lot of problems.
SPEAKER_01: don't think it's going to be an easy match and i think that he may be able to control center initially but i think that his best performances are going to come early and by the end i should have better control i think that uh i will be perfect um the second of june of november
SPEAKER_01: i'll be i'll be perfect uh yeah i think that everything will come together wonderfully you know i i took a some really much needed time off to repair and kind of hit bottom and get healthy and and now i'm climbing in my strength in my dedication and my target is set it's fixed
SPEAKER_04: And I think that I will probably destroy him that day. I think I'll probably destroy him. Do you realize that he didn't show any weakness with the endurance lately? Like Dadikyan beat Todd Hutchings even from some kind of losing position. And at the end, his endurance was better. You know, I mean, because he ended up beating him four times, you know.
SPEAKER_04: and so petrenko no no no i mean that it can be hushings you understand in a method that stopped and in a match that actually took him here and dadikian's endurance was good enough to win that that super match it was not like a quick pin you know and then same petrenko kind of exhausted um i want to understand
SPEAKER_04: It was early in the game where he did some heavy damage to him. Last round, the match stopped at the center. And then it was... Listen, the damage was earlier, but the last round, the match stopped. And then it stopped here, and still he ended up winning. Also, Ongarbev, four rounds, he could not stop him. Ongarbev, known...
SPEAKER_04: to be someone with good endurance as well. So are we sure that Petrenko will gas out against you? I think it's very likely. Very likely. I think that most likely my style will give him problems. I think that he's going to have a hard time keeping his wrist integrity.
SPEAKER_01: And I think that he will be forced into just worse positions. And during our exchange with him, hopefully he'll get a worse position than me. Slowly, I'll be able to drain his strength. And then by the end, it'll seem like I'm a lot stronger than he is. But the truth is, is that he will be just fatigued. And that'll come in the early rounds. In the early rounds, I'll do a lot of damage to him, damage to his wrist, damage to his elbow as he tries to pin out a position.
SPEAKER_04: I don't think he will be able to maintain the pieces that he needs to beat me four times. I don't think he will. You are right now, after the close with discount, 117 kilo. And you will be 105 kilo. And are you telling me that you are not going to lose anything at all while you're losing the weight?
SPEAKER_01: thing is is right now i'm getting stronger and i'm trying not to gain weight so i'll try and stay this weight and get stronger and and i think i should be able to do that i you know when i when i get into a build up for a match normally i just kind of slowly slowly get stronger until the match happens and i don't and i have enough fat that i don't think i need to eat like a crazy person i just you know i'll kind of just stay at this level
SPEAKER_01: the water cut is going to be challenging that is going to be a challenging water cut will i lose a little bit of strength maybe maybe a bit but not enough not enough i don't know what do you think right now i uh i definitely agree with devin um it's hard for me to imagine honestly uh oleg
SPEAKER_02: not getting gassed out even if Devin might lose maybe the first one or two rounds he will get fatigued extremely fast and I mean he did show a very good endurance in his Zadikian match I mean in his match against Zadikian and even against Muratov on his left hand that was incredible I mean
SPEAKER_02: He's the only one that actually put the brakes on Murato and it looked like the match was kind of even. But I think if he loses his wrist and gets pumped up a little bit too fast, which he definitely will, there's no chance. I'm afraid that he will definitely be gassed up by the end of it and lose.
SPEAKER_04: And Reno, if you beat Devin and then he comes to 115, sorry, if you beat Sago and get the title and if Devin challenges you, what is your chance against him? Well, I'm not sure. Do you think that your flop is exactly what fits because he goes like this, open arm top row, and then you love doing that? I'm not sure. I think...
SPEAKER_02: I think because of my versatility, I think I would have a better shot at beating him on the right hand. But I don't know. I think my chances are right now not so great, but in the future, probably a little bit better. When you say better than Petrenko or better than Devin's chance against you? I think better than Petrenko's. Okay. What chance Petrenko has? Petrenko...
SPEAKER_02: you mean kind of uh i don't know for something 40 50. i think it's 70 30 or something like that 65 35 for devon 65 35 and yours i think mine would be a little bit closer maybe 40 60 45 55 something like that for the devon of course yeah yeah you know you know you know saying a super chat he says reno needs to stop eating jawapi and he would be he would he would be
SPEAKER_04: oh my god that's uh that's a good point uh but it's super hard to stop eating chevapi because they are simply irresistible they're too good they're a great source of protein there is a question for db talks devon if john berzin stood up in the crowd and on the microphone said devon show everyone here why i believe you are the best make me proud
SPEAKER_04: would you have beat Levan in the rematch? You are saying that you wish that was that easy, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a funny question. That's a, you know, if John Brzezinski ever does that, you know, probably going to squeeze out a little bit more, but man, it's tough to do against Levan. It's tough to do against Levan. Yeah. But listen, I will tell you something. What were you like 122 kilos maybe?
SPEAKER_04: I mean, being 122 kilo, being that close to heavyweight and then pulling in super heavyweight against someone who is 50, 55 kilo heavier, that round one, you did a good job. I mean, I think you did very well. I mean, it is not that easy, man, that the guy is...
SPEAKER_04: really huge guy really big guy the guy is the best the best guy some some people like some people talk oh there should be a weight limit why is this there is a weight limit there is heavy weight if you want to pull but if you want to stay on this earth nobody can beat me then you cannot complain about the opponent's weight that guy is a human right and then lives on the earth right so if you want to say no one can beat me you can complain about the weight you know yeah
SPEAKER_04: anyways okay let's talk let's talk let's start about the king of the table next week these these matches are very very interesting very interesting and um do you know the guys catch bear i i've seen him i've seen video he looks incredible he looks great he looks perfect and do you know do you know nadaline cristo reno do you know these guys
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah i do what what do you think i know devon knows them but i i'm not sure if they won't really follow them deeply but not i don't follow him super close what i've seen from the polish guy is he's great yeah yeah he's really really good and what are your opinion do you guys know enough to have opinions
SPEAKER_01: I, all I know really is the Polish guy and he looks really good. So I don't know a lot about the other guy, but this guy's, this guy looks phenomenal. So I don't know. Yeah. Kind of the same as, as Devon. Honestly, I haven't really followed them super closely, but they both look really good. I think it's going to be a close match. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And let me ask the other one that, you know, I'm sure that Devon will give us some very objective opinion about Arden and Dorian Hulk. I can't wait. Really, I can't wait. A lot of people are like, Devon, you're handpicking your opponents. You're making this easy for Arden. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_01: no as a father i feel a little bit bad i've really thrown him in with a i i think a very hard opponent strong guy lots of experience um you know auden does have some structural advantages his hand's gonna be bigger he's gonna be taller but that's that's about it that's about that's about it you know the rest technical advantage endurance and there are more i think
SPEAKER_04: yeah probably technical odds a very good technician very very good and he pulls all day you know i think he if somehow he stops the match i think he will also have good chance to exhaust open it or not
SPEAKER_01: i don't know i don't know um it's the physical side of things i'm not so sure about like physically i have a feeling korean hulk is very very strong i i think that there might be a lot of things that indicate he's tremendously strong so if the match stops you know auden's gonna have to be very smart he's gonna have to fight very hard he's gonna have to work and
SPEAKER_01: play it very intelligently i think if he just sticks in a spot he could get in some serious problems i don't know really all i can say is that auden has worked very hard he's worked very hard and i think that he's going to be in fantastic shape so tell us tell us tell us objectively not not from the heart but from the mind give us some percentage
SPEAKER_04: Can you do that as their father? No, I can't. Could you tell us if you think that Corey and Hulk had the higher percentage of winning? Do you think you could say this?
SPEAKER_01: It's very hard. In my position, this is very hard to do. I have to fully support Auden. I'm aware that this match has its challenges. And the thing that's interesting for me is I feel like Korean Hulk is super pissed. I think he's very upset. About what? About Auden. Auden's funny, right? Auden is kind of poking him a little bit, just doing funny stuff on Instagram.
SPEAKER_01: And has stopped replying, stopped replying to me, stopped replying to Aden. I know he sees the things you can see seen, but he doesn't reply. So I think Aden at one point said he was going to rip his arm off. And that was it. No more communication. He is coming to Dubai to destroy Aden in his head.
SPEAKER_01: I think so. I think that that's what happened. I think that everything was cool. And then Auden, you know, pushing it a little bit, trying to build some excitement. I think he probably upset him. And now I think that the guy is, you know, he's a bit mad. And I think that'll actually work in Auden's favor because I don't think Auden has a problem with fighting. I really don't think he does. I mean...
SPEAKER_01: So we'll, we'll see. I'm real. That's the match obviously that I'm, I'm going there for like, I am going to corner and watch and support on my match is hilarious. I'm going to kill Leonidas. It's not even, there's nothing the guy can do to me, like nothing at all. So I'm just there to enjoy really on really. And Reno, what do you think shortly about this match? We, we, we need to cover the other ones as well.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah um i i agree with devin i think uh honor is going to win this simply because i'm not sure how technically good the korean hulk is um i think that from what i saw his wrist looked a little small and his hands looked a little bit smaller so i think that's going to be a vantage point for auden to attack especially because he's you know going uh always uh in a
SPEAKER_02: kind of open top roll kind of position or King's move even. And I think that the Korean Hulk's lack of experience in matches and even technical knowledge is going to definitely
SPEAKER_02: be a massive disadvantage for him and even if he pins on once i think he's going to get more tired out and it just has so many more like other lanes open for him uh that he can you know fight in where the korean hook doesn't know anything um so i think just on is going to destroy him okay dino is asking you reno greetings from warazdin i wish you good luck
SPEAKER_04: And to you, Devon, you need to win in 105 class the three division champion. Let's go. Hi, Dino. Thanks for the support. No, no, because he already won the 115 in the past. So when he wins this one, so he will be winning the three one. So he didn't mean that.
SPEAKER_04: to win 115 again. Obviously, you take it on yourself, right? You thought that he was wishing Devon good luck? No, I was just... I mean, he's from Városdín, so I know the place. I was just thanking him for the support. I wasn't actually thinking that he was talking about my match against Devon. Okay, okay. Because him to win the 115 again,
SPEAKER_04: he needs to win 105 and then he needs to beat the winner of the UN Cypher. And you said you will beat. Yeah. So I thought that you made a fast calculation. No, no, no, no. I'm not thinking that far ahead. Okay. Billy Bob, if Brian Shaw trains for three weeks, three weeks, can Lewand win? Okay. Three weeks.
SPEAKER_02: nothing gets done in three weeks guys okay tell us tell us rob vision versus nugo nugo oh this is not even i think uh question i mean i love nugo man that guy is awesome i love watching nugo is
SPEAKER_02: it's like he's connected to a car battery you know he's just crazy crazy guy he constantly like mocks me and wants me to have a match with him i i'm sure that the time will come for that as well but can you believe that it's incredible yeah there are so many match possibilities when i started organizing east versus west like some people they were sailing in you are
SPEAKER_04: put in so many elite matches in one cut we will run out of matches and I said no you give more chances to people there will be more possibilities because every result of this event will create the new new you know possibilities yeah yeah yeah absolutely absolutely and I think nougat is just going to crush Rob I don't know Rob kind of whenever he's on the table at least for me he kind of seems uh
SPEAKER_02: intimidated by his opponents i don't know it's just like nugo doesn't care who's across the table he just wants to hit you know and get into his position and like completely you know destroy you on the table so i think that's going to be a massive advantage for him i i believe that nugo in his mind except the super heavyweight guys he would go every match by 100 percent believing he's gonna win if nugo is playing devon
SPEAKER_04: i don't think that he would be intimidated at all no no no not not no no he wouldn't could be my first portion win
SPEAKER_04: I mean, we have only two Georgians, right? Not so many. Gennady, Gennady and Lovato. So I need, I don't know, maybe give me Betkili or I don't know, I don't know. Listen, 105, you versus Betkili, trust me, good match. Oh, I know, I know. That guy at 95 kilos, he beat Taino. Imagine him being 105 and he's a tall guy, very tall guy. He's like 6'3".
SPEAKER_04: So he's pulling Oleg, right? Yeah. Rematch. Yeah, Oleg beat him before. I think it's different now. I mean, Oleg, there was also the return of Oleg after the injury, the accident. So I am sure that right now Oleg is also better.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. And Badkili is also much better. I feel like Badkili is a lot better. Yeah, Badkili that I know for many years pulling WoW and Europeans, a very tall guy, very skinny looking guy, this time he doesn't. Oh, yeah. No, he's gotten much better. Like, the way he pulled Tain off, that was amazing.
SPEAKER_04: And he has, because he is tall, long arms, you know, he has good reach as well. He versus some of the 105 guys will be great, yeah. Dino, Dino doesn't stop asking. He'll say, yeah, I mean 105, he will win. But one young guy is going to stop him in 115 kilo. Who's going to stop Devin? Oh, Sago, Sago, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't think Sago is that young. I don't know how old Sago is.
SPEAKER_01: Let's just, let's just say imaginary land, imaginary land. Okay. Uh, say we both win. Yeah. Say we both win. When would you want to do your first defense and who would you want it to be again? Of course you, no, no, no, no, no, not you, not you, not you. He would want to.
SPEAKER_04: would want to have a permanent bell so he would avoid pulling you just to have two other wins yes yes yes you would just agree with me you are saying yes yes no i'm joking i'm joking of course i don't know as as soon as uh i don't know as soon as it's possible uh i don't really have anything after after
SPEAKER_02: King, I mean, East vs. West 15, I don't have really anything until... How about beginning of February? But who knows? Maybe I'm going to say Petrenko vs. Tagov match. Yeah, who knows? They might both be losers. They might both have lost. Yeah, yeah. But I don't think that's... That's maybe in some alternate universe, not in this one. I'm afraid. We will see.
SPEAKER_04: We will see. Irino, how do you like my stream pod performance in the WhatsApp group? Your what performance? Pod stream. Like starting things, you know. It's all right. It's all right. It's not too bad. I think you need to work on it just a little bit more.
SPEAKER_04: but it's good it's good you know good but what do you realize is suddenly everyone goes at each other you know in the group you know yeah yeah yeah one starts then the other is yeah yeah yeah yeah something going yeah otherwise it's boring you know okay let's go let's go to another match jablonski versus corey west corey stays quiet but he privately sent me some photos i don't want to share the guy is
SPEAKER_04: like before he looked very big strong guy but now he doesn't look that way anymore of course he's still big but he looks muscular you know do you think that with some speed on the side way he has chance against coming he definitely got a good chance definitely
SPEAKER_01: he's definitely got a good chance i i have to think he's the underdog i do um but he's definitely got a chance and the thing is with corey i still think that when he shows up he's getting better and better still i think he's he's new enough in his career that he's continuing to take big steps forward and i got a feeling he's gonna have a very good day that day
SPEAKER_04: Kamil Jablonski is really serious, really serious left-handed, especially. I mean, you saw him against Lalletti. I mean, there was a possibility that Kamil could have won that super match. If he was a little bit careful, now he was number one. And do you know what? I think Kamil is the guy that...
SPEAKER_04: Who has the highest chance to beat Vitaly Laletin amongst all others? Yeah, I agree. I agree. A left-handed for sure. Yeah. Yeah, left-handed we are talking about. Yeah, because like a lot of people think that unofficially Vitaly is number one. I see this as a kind of little bit disrespecting Morozov because they are going to pull the next match. But let's see. And what do you think, Bruno, about Kamil versus Cody West?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. I, I, as well, I have the, I have come as the favorite in my mind. Definitely. I think he's faster than Corey. And I think if he catches Corey off guard, even a little bit, I think that's going to be very difficult for Corey to defend. I don't know how, because the only match that I have in my mind is like with Corey that I really like watched and followed really carefully was, um, his match against tomorrow's, but that was on the right hand and.
SPEAKER_02: No, Morozov was the left arm. With Corey? Yeah. Okay, but... It was kind of like real dominance. Yeah, yes, total dominance. I don't know how good Corey is at defending when he is in some kind of a nasty position because from what I saw...
SPEAKER_02: it just it just didn't look like he had the technical knowledge to kind of get out of those kind of difficult situations so uh definitely camel is the favorite in my mind and i think he's faster um and and he's really really good on the left hand and i mean we will see but uh carmel is in my mind the favorite dino says devon needs to come to croatia
SPEAKER_04: No, you know a little bit of it. Nice, nice. Jimmy 19 says, Michael Todd versus Gennady winner, full Hermes. If Hermes is ready, yes, that is what is planned, yeah. Isn't Hermes like cutting weight for something? He's a lot lighter than he was before. No, I think the other day I talked with him on WhatsApp with video call. He said he was like 124 kilos.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, a little bit lighter, but if he doesn't have a match, no need to really. Yeah, of course. Maybe he's going for 115. I don't think he wants that. No, I don't think so. Yeah. Okay, let's go to the next one. Georgi Swetko versus Sergei Kalinchenko. Kalinchenko. Wow.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, a controversial pick. Kalinischenko, remember when he pulled against Arif, he was very big. But this time, what I see on social media, I think he's even bigger than that. And soon you will see in real. But you remember, have you seen Georgi Svetkov in Moldova, Reno?
SPEAKER_04: Noah, I haven't seen him. I think he was there for one or two days only for the juniors. Yes, early days. You came for the seniors, so you didn't see him. I have never seen him this big either. Weight-wise or just like frame, huge frame? Like the muscles, you know, like the shoulders, trapezius, forearms, everything. He was like a bulldog. Like a bull, like a bull.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, in my mind, I think Cvetko is going to win this, even though I think Sergei has a good shot. But the only thing that I see stopping Sergei is his endurance. I think that's the biggest issue with him. And especially when they go both top row, even if Sergei takes one or two rounds, I think
SPEAKER_04: Cetkov is going to outlast him regarding stamina and endurance. I remember Georgi's stamina against Devin. Devin, during the match, he exhausted Georgi, but every round it starts, Georgi was still near fresh. Again, put Devin into the bad position.
SPEAKER_02: So that's why I'm thinking. And Sergei lost his match against Gerrano because of stamina. He almost lost to Matt Mask as well because of stamina and endurance. And who else was it? He's not the same guy, trust me. He's not the same guy. He's a completely different guy. He wasn't like a heavyweight guy now.
SPEAKER_04: super heavyweight guy this is not the same guy either nobody is the same nobody if you tell me you get in good shape and then pull the samusha first time or first three time came to east versus west i would give very good chance but the the samusha that became like someone right now is just like every event they they are becoming like do you think that design is the same design the guy is
SPEAKER_02: No, for sure not. But I don't know, even if they're not the same people or the same guy, I don't think that that weight that he put on or strength, I don't know how much that will benefit his endurance. It might benefit his start and everything, but how does it affect his endurance? I don't know. Okay. Go ahead, Dylan. Sorry. I think it's a very good match, and I think that the key is going to be versatility.
SPEAKER_01: That's what I think. And I think that Kalenchenko may have gotten himself strong enough where he can stop the match. Okay. I think he might be strong enough. And if he is, I think his versatility, he can, he can press, he can flop. He can, he can do more things than Georgie has probably the one of the best, if not the best top role, you know, but only one way.
SPEAKER_01: has a hard time getting his shoulder involved or hooking or pressing. So if Sergey can wedge in, I don't know, I think you'd be a good match for him, Reno. Me and Sergey.
SPEAKER_02: no no no not sergey oh no uh i don't know i tried uh many years ago i mean many years ago for me for me it's many years ago it's like three years ago um i tried pulling with him in the on after pools you know uh after europeans my first ever europeans and it was an absolute nightmare i mean only grabbing his hand is like holding something
SPEAKER_02: like it's just enormous honestly and that's one of my yeah that's one of my like biggest issues my hand size and so it would be a good match but maybe a little bit postponed for the future so you know i i have pulled guys in 60 kilo had bigger hands than you have yeah yeah i know
SPEAKER_02: So, I mean, Rustam is one of the examples that I can use, of course, for someone with small hands that made a very good career. And he was incredible. He was always able to force people into a hook. His hand is bigger than yours, my friend. Yes, but that's something that I'm kind of reassuring myself about. So it's OK that I have small hands. You said that you never handshake with Reno, right?
SPEAKER_04: Just listen, listen. When you come to Istanbul, just handshake with him and then just for a second just hold his hand in your palm and look at it for one second. And then you won't believe how this guy is doing all those things with such hand size, you know. You will be like...
SPEAKER_02: it's not possible yeah yeah my my hand is uh very comfortable for people i think that's one of the things maybe that off puts them in the start of the match they think it's you know it's okay but i am able to you know cop them in no some people say that engine is roasting reno no there was a compliment he has he has small hands and he is winning the world wars in
SPEAKER_04: It is very, very hard thing to do with such hand size. Let's go to Alex Kurdeca versus Artem Morozov. This match is also very interesting. Only four months ago, I think people were thinking that, or five months ago, they were thinking that Alex Kurdeca is the guy to beat.
SPEAKER_04: Levon Saginashvili. And then after his match against Jerry, now people have their doubts. And Morozov also lost against Vitaly. It was a dominant win. And these two guys have big dreams, but they can't afford to lose again if they really want to be in the conversation. I think Morozov.
SPEAKER_04: But can you explain to me, like, I'm not saying Morozov or Alex, but can you, when you say something like this, can you explain how you imagine the match? No problem.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so first of all, when I look at them and when I see the timing, so I find that timing is an issue, okay? Now, when you look at, like, world-level guys, you know, it's probably ideal that they have a few months between matches. This is probably ideal, okay? Alex just had a big match, okay? He just came over to Canada. He's...
SPEAKER_01: He's back competing. The time structure is not perfect for him. Morozov, I feel, has had a better preparation. Morozov looks...
SPEAKER_01: incredible. Like to me, when I see pictures, when I see him training, Morozov looks really, really good right now. And I don't think that the credential will show up in better shape than he was against Jerry. I don't expect them to be better. I expect them to be the same or maybe a bit worse. That's what I think. How the mess is going now. Referee said, ready, go. Where is where should Morozov go? Alex is going to go fully outside.
SPEAKER_01: i think that they'll both go outside i think that both of them will go outside and alex will be a little bit more offensive and morozov will be a little bit more open and potentially you know try and stop the match in some kind of a more open position but i don't think you should try and hook him i think he should you know kind of open top or you know let it post on his arm and see if he can stop the match and i think if he can achieve that
SPEAKER_01: He'll win, okay? And I think that, I think he's strong enough that he will be able to do that. I think it'll be a great match, but also for me,
SPEAKER_01: Look, they both are similar in their level, I believe, but I think that if there's an endurance favorite, it has to be Morozov. And I'd even give the edge on versatility to him as well. So Alex has to be, in my mind, a significant step stronger, and I don't think that that's the case. Okay, you are saying that Morozov is...
SPEAKER_02: Sorry for interrupting you, Engin. My phone is about to die and I don't have a charger. Thank you for inviting me, guys. I hope you have a good night. See you, guys.
SPEAKER_04: okay uh devon let's go this quick and hey that kid's amazing right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he's a good guy when when when i think about this guy look at i i know that we're not supposed to make john brzenk comparisons i know we're not supposed to do that but
SPEAKER_04: if he does like he's already awesome and he's been from a young age like i feel like this generations i don't know like i feel like like like john bersing is like this it may be like a more like jerry catterett you know like what made john bersing is yeah more more control but i mean like the hand control that you understand i mean that that
SPEAKER_01: Jarvis had incredible hand control, but at the end, to me, it's about winning. And Reno's resume at 20 is very nice. And I mean, say, oh, it's different nowadays, or it's not different. I think it's harder to win the WAF, you know, the way, like, the WAF's harder to win now than it was, you know, 20, 30, 40 years ago. Yeah, but Jerry Cadoret, when he was 22, 23, he won the WAF
SPEAKER_04: because he didn't compete before. And he also took second place to get a good reach at the Yukon Jack. So he was also very, at that time, the Yukon Jack was toughest event, tougher than the even WAF. Yeah, but nothing like West. Nothing like East First. No, no, no, no. There has never been something like this at this level. Yeah. Yeah. He's incredible. Yeah. He can also pull in different ways as well, Reno.
SPEAKER_04: But there is, unfortunately, that the hand, you will see, not that big. Like, John's hand is just, I mean, really heavyweight hand. You know, even when he was 85, 90 kilos, you held his hand, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and also big hand. Everything is midi and big, you know. I don't think that he ever had a problem to have a grip on. He even hooked, you know, hold him low and get him in hook, you know.
SPEAKER_04: About that, you are saying that Morozov is well-rounded and he has better... Do you remember when you pulled Dave Chaffee in the same event Morozov was pulling against Corey West?
SPEAKER_04: and do you remember his physical shape he was like incredible big and after that he was gonna pull levan and he had the stomach issue and then he kind of got much smaller but the the moroso we saw today is like very similar to do that shape i see him i don't know what you think so do you think that this this morozo
SPEAKER_01: made you think different than people expected? Or after the Laletin match, you cut your hopes about him being a challenger to the top? No, definitely not. I think Morozov's really smart. I think he's a brilliant guy, very funny guy. And I think, unfortunately, I think he, you know, he had a date with Levan and, you know, and he was...
SPEAKER_01: and he ended up hurting himself a little bit. And I think there's a probably really good chance that he's probably rebounded fully from that. I think that he was on a trajectory
SPEAKER_01: for that world title shot. He was on a trajectory. Now, Vitaly, Vitaly is incredible. And I think that technically he went about that in a really weird way. I mean, trying to try to Vitaly is, I don't know. I couldn't imagine trying to hook Vitaly, especially outside of the straps. I would think this was be completely crazy. Um, so I think technically he didn't really have a good answer for Vitaly. I think that,
SPEAKER_04: I think he could do better. I think he could go wrong. I mean, can you imagine that Vitaly is such an explosive guy from start to the pin pad and Morozov, okay, hook was a mistake and then he tried to go outside.
SPEAKER_04: And, like, how can you start, like, without loading fully against Laletin while he is... Because Morozov is someone that's slow. You know, he catches people right here, and then he wins the match. And then you're going to be that slow, and you're going to pull probably the most explosive...
SPEAKER_04: super heavyweight, and then you're going to start without fully loading. Like, Hermes loaded so much, then he barely stopped him right here, you know, Vitaly. And you're going to start, and you will be, Hermes is not a slow guy. But Morozov is slow. How? He had to do a lot of loading.
SPEAKER_04: give his 100% before the goal so that maybe he would stop here. But if you try to do like 80% and try to match Vitaly's explosiveness, of course the next thing you will see that your hand is on the pad. Not the best technical performance? Not the very best? No.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, for sure he's one of the guys that's going to be closing in on that world title if he can. We'll see. I have his favorite. I have his favorite to win. Okay. And the last match, there is the guy that he is going to go outside with you. He is going to go far hand.
SPEAKER_04: far side of your hand, but he can't top roll and then he will suddenly switch and then do the dead wrist pressure to far side of your hand and will be the biggest upset in the history. Leonidas, Arcona, four, Devon Larratt is zero.
SPEAKER_01: Listen, I'm happy that he accepted this match. I'm happy that I get to do this. It doesn't, the great thing about it is, so I started really to prepare, you know, when I got the call for Chance. Okay, so I had a few days, you know, start thinking about getting serious before Chance. Since Chance, it's been an uphill and it's going to keep on going all the way up until I face Petrenko.
SPEAKER_04: And this here in the middle, this is no interruption. This is just training. For me, this is a training match. I'm going to go in. I have no stress. Hengen, easy day for me. Listen, listen. He accepted first John match and then when I reached him and offered him about the Devon match, he accepted the both matches. Do you think that after his win against Schoolboy,
SPEAKER_04: Um, he kind of was like, okay, I train a little bit. Look what I did already. And now I have more time. And do you think that he underestimated, but I will tell you something. If John didn't have all that.
SPEAKER_04: knowledge and experience in his head Leonidas would beat him that day John won because of his unlimited experience and knowledge he pushed his limits and then he did everything perfectly find that small hole and then made that hole bigger against Leonidas yeah Leonidas was very strong
SPEAKER_01: really good yeah but it's it's not going to be the same with me i i don't think that he has anything on me i don't think he's stronger i don't think he has better endurance i mean we don't even need to talk about technique i don't think there's anything where he really has me so i think it's gonna be fun i think it's gonna be really fun um you know i'll teach him a bit of a lesson and uh
SPEAKER_04: You know, he's going to give me, I get to put a tattoo on him afterwards. The interesting part is that you got so scared of him and you had to gain weight up to 260 just because Leo. Then we all know that you have a 231 match against Petrenko and you gain weight to 260 just for Leo. Why is that? Well, you know, I just, Jody cooks so well.
SPEAKER_04: Jody takes such good care of me that I really should be 300 pounds, but. Listen, listen, how we never see you 300 pounds when you even have super heavyweight match. You almost reach the weight that you, when you pull super heavyweight, you were like 260, 64, 264 when you pull against Hermes. And now you are like four or five pounds, maybe six pounds behind there. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Anyways, here's another one. Dino says, look, we need you, Engin, back at 85 kilos. They said, I missed another super shit. Oh, okay. Sorry, this one. Reno, if Devin Colts give him Jouarji, okay, sorry, he left. I missed that one. Sorry about it. Anyways, so you're going to beat him, huh? You're going to beat Leonidas? Yeah. Oh, Engin. I feel silly even talking about it.
SPEAKER_01: like you feel you feel disrespect you want me to talk like this look it i mean i'm happy to look at i i like to go to these things i love to go to king of the table i love to go to east versus west if someone else to give me an easy match oh i'll take it i'll take it no problem no problem at all um
SPEAKER_01: that's to me i think easy match i think fun match i think i'm gonna kill him i think i'm gonna kill him um he's got like what three years of arm wrestling how good can he be how good can somebody be in three years four years i mean he is probably taking very seriously for last one year you know
SPEAKER_01: yeah come on like look here i love the guy i love leonidas i think he's a great guy charming dude really like to spend time with him um but on the arm wrestling table like he has many years of work to do i think i think he has many years a quick question will you be surprised would you be surprised if somehow this i don't know
SPEAKER_01: No, I will be surprised, but it's very possible. Oh, the Zernoff. I mean, you can tell me this because I was talking about the Zernoff the other day. Now, I think I may have got it wrong, but I heard that he went to the Worlds his first year. And did he win? I don't know about the first year, but in 2019,
SPEAKER_04: was 110 kilo he beat ivan matushenko right and left he he'd been pulling before that yeah he has he had yeah he was pulling and he had some wins against italy right and left right did he did he pull laugh his first year i don't remember which one was his first year because i have seen all of these guys that you know
SPEAKER_04: I mean, for many years, like many years, like I like first, my first walk was 1993. And since then,
SPEAKER_04: Like I have seen all these guys. I don't exactly remember when was exactly the first time I saw them. But I don't know, it was really strong. Like just watch the 2019 WAF. He's beating Matushenko right and left and beating Matushenko right and left, especially at WAF.
SPEAKER_04: when there is test is very, very hard thing to do. And were you surprised? I was surprised the way he beat Rivas. I thought that first round without the strap, it would be nightmare for Deserano. And he just right away at the middle of the table, he hook Rivas. And it was 165 kilo Rivas. What do you say? I thought Rivas was going to win that match. Yeah, I thought that he couldn't, he couldn't, he couldn't.
SPEAKER_04: GB19, my friend, I can't see the top of the chat. Please, right here, without super chat, I will read it. Please. Yeah, I thought that, especially the early rounds, I thought that maybe with Andros, he would stop him. But he just right away dominated him in hook, in the top row.
SPEAKER_04: Trust me, I can guarantee you one thing. The Zerano is probably stronger than Laletin, except the hand, you know. And of course, Proneidra is good, but the horsepower, he has much more. If he stops that much, it will be very hard.
SPEAKER_01: Zernoff is one of those people who has such obvious strength around him. Like, sometimes I find when I get close to people like Zernoff, I can really sense it. Like, you can really sense his overall strength, his overall genetic strength. I think he's probably, even in, like, the group of East versus West athletes, so very...
SPEAKER_04: He's even in that group genetically very, very strong. Very, very strong human being. I want you to, when you see him in November, just remember, I want you to say hello and hit his back like this. You will feel like you're hitting a wall. Seriously, like you will hit him and he will not move even one something. You will feel that he is concrete, you know, he just like, he doesn't even move.
SPEAKER_01: He's very special. That guy is very, very special. He's really a wild card. If he beats Vitaly, then I think he will beat everybody else in the division except for LeBron.
SPEAKER_04: Let's see, two more Super Chats and then let's finish and then we can talk about the East vs West after the King of the Table. PrimeBrehzink says, Devon, how excited would you be for Arden vs Baco? Devon's son vs Levan's son, match of the century, but Baco is not Levan's son.
SPEAKER_01: and then from here we can go. We still need some time. In my mind, I'm closer to playing Baccio than Andres. I think that there's a good chance that Baccio is right at the top or title shot. You saw him in Reno. He was almost beating, but Reno, trust me, the worst guy for him.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Well, they're asking Bacho and you. Yeah. I said just a little bit of time still. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A little bit more time. Yeah, a little bit. And it was the worst. Like, because Bacho is very strong in the wrist. And Reno was diving in to ride his bicep. And he was the worst guy, you know. And the other super chat is...
SPEAKER_04: GB19 is asking, do you have any updates on Dennis? Dennis probably going to be ready next year about spring. And there is a possibility that he may come to the East versus West 15, but not sure. Very soon I will have an answer about that. You were saying something, Devon. Sorry, I cut. I think you should pull Dave Chafee.
SPEAKER_04: yeah it would be good yeah but but he is not this some guy just made a poster um and like we didn't make that he made his first response and they shouldn't do that if they want to make a poster they shouldn't like max make something that is look like you know we made it because people may think this is real and then they may get disappointed
SPEAKER_04: um yes it may be a good match but how can i set a match for dennis when dennis says that he is not ready and he cannot so he will pull next year dennis is one of the icons you know he's one of the legendary coolers of our sport so if we want him to be part of the arm wrestling in an active way we need to make sure that he pulls
SPEAKER_04: in a level that fits him as of now we can't really push him you need to become the best while he's not ready so it doesn't matter he doesn't have to be best and right now Dave Sheffield is not at his best so Dave Sheffield versus Dennis would be good but when both guys are uh ready yeah anyways Devon uh thank you for uh
SPEAKER_04: uh sharing your time and opinions with us and i wish all of you guys the best i cannot only wish you the best uh because i'm the promoter and i especially wish best to leonidas and he is gonna beat you with the dead risk pressure and it will be the the biggest upset of the center
SPEAKER_01: You don't even let me to hype the match. You don't even let me to hype the match, yeah. I mean, come on. Come on. Like, don't buy King of the Table. Buy King of the Table to watch Arden.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, you can also watch me completely filet him, lay him out like pieces of meat before barbecue. It's going to be... Do you know what? A lot of people buy the pay-per-view to watch you doing all these things that you are doing. Yeah. I'm going to completely... I will abuse him. I'll abuse him. Okay. Thank you very much, Devon. And take care. Stay healthy. Yeah. Thank you.
SPEAKER_04: maybe you get out yeah and then maybe i talk with the guys a bit okay guys any plans on east west in canada i mean anything is possible anything is possible guys okay let's chat for like five minutes and then i also go away i need to go train um i i don't know if you can buy a t-shirt at your hotel but
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I just answered it. But, like, Dennis is going to answer soon if he's coming or not. What do I think about Ali Can? Win next match? I don't know. We will see. Ali Can versus Ivan Matushenko will be a good one. Okay, guys. And...
SPEAKER_04: Take care. Take care, Neil. Take care, my friends. Yeah, David versus Vladimir. Incredible match, yeah. I have my own pronator training, my friends. Different trainings, not the ones that you see.
SPEAKER_04: Gene, yeah, it can come to South Africa as well. It's totally up to the conditions when we need to find sponsors over there and things like that. What to think about Gyorgy Dizeronov? Gyorgy Dizeronov is a solid guy, very strong guy, very strong guy.
SPEAKER_04: I don't think Devon is going to face Vitaly very soon. I think Devon wants to win the titles in 105 and 115. And then probably a year later from now, he will be pulling the super airweight. But he knows. I don't know if Travis is going to compete in his first race. I don't know how he is feeling.
SPEAKER_04: Or teach you how to train pronation. Okay, I need to make a video. Ustinov is very strong. Ustinov is very strong. Ustinov just won the WAP in a dominant fashion. And now he will have his super match for the world title. But one category below. But he is not that far because he last year, he won the, not that he won, but he competed the WAP in 70 kilos.
SPEAKER_04: Thank you, Benji. Thank you, Phil. Just ordered a second East versus West Jersey chat. They are brilliant, yeah. Thank you, Phil, for your support. Arsene Lillie, I don't have any updates. Good that you reminded me. Let me write him tonight. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I think I barely have time to train myself and I'm like barely pushing myself to train. I lost so much size, but just slowly, slowly trying to get backwards. I am very unhappy about the size that I lost and
SPEAKER_04: Alex Kurdeca vs Artem Morozov is a tough match. I think that Kurdeca is the one with probably better hand and wrist if he doesn't learn something new. But I think Morozov has more horsepower and better endurance but we will see.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, Gagan says that Devon once said that Georgi Svetko can beat Hermes and now is that Kalina gonna beat Georgi? Yeah, but we don't know which way he's thinking and also Kalina is getting bigger and better. I don't know, probably weighs over 130 kilo. Okay guys, let me go training.
SPEAKER_04: thank you for being part of the podcast and let me i miss i miss to be at the stage i don't know if i ever be good enough every time i start training something happens to me in a health wise and hopefully hopefully this time i can train without any accidents or health problems and but
SPEAKER_04: Let me go and train. See, forearm is coming, but the biceps are very small. Take care, guys.
