Speaker: Thank you.
SPEAKER_04: Hello, hello everyone.
SPEAKER_02: Let me share this. There is not a December is coffee and milk. Hello, guys. Let me quickly share this on
SPEAKER_02: Facebook and maybe also Instagram and then we can start soon Genadi will join sorry guys for making you guys wait but I'm still not very good at these things about armwrestling yeah
SPEAKER_04: good but there's things okay this is the last one and
SPEAKER_02: I'm back to you guys. What did you guys think about the question I asked? Did you guys see that? I asked about if Rino Massage versus Ibragim Sagov match should be a world title match. Rino Massage won the Worlds and Ibragim Sagov beat Sandris in a supermatch. Normally, Ivan Ivan Matyushenko is ranked above them, but has some shoulder issues.
SPEAKER_02: And Devon was the champion, but he lost the title because of inactivity. And so right now, I think that it is a fair match for the world title.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Tarkan was very good.
SPEAKER_02: Nate late night bicep workout. I was one before I did 15 kilo, of course, full motion with dumbbell. This time I did 17 kilo. The next one I will do 20 kilos. So I will try to go up like this, uh, small increases to two and a half kilo. I don't want to go. I don't want to go right away. I want to go slowly because.
SPEAKER_02: Um, next month I will be 50 years old. So the recovery is not that good. You know, you just stop for like five, six months and then it takes a long time to go back to the same shape. We will see.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, Vitalii Laletin versus Artem Morozov left arm wall title. Yeah. Next year, I think, not I think, but it will be their first left arm matches. Yeah. No, I'm not using anything. Doctor told me to use something for my hair, but I didn't use it. I heard that it has some kind of side effects or something. So
SPEAKER_02: We invited Zaur for a legends match against Sharon Ramess, but he cancelled the match. And he said that he has so much pain. Yeah. Yeah, stem cells, yeah, help. But I always say, my friend, that, like,
SPEAKER_02: The damage is like a damage of 30, 35 years. You know, you like, if it was just one incident, you know, one injury, you know, a new fresh one or something, probably it would be easier. But when your damages are like, like a lot of times, and I repeated the same thing. And also there is an overuse overuse problem, you know,
SPEAKER_02: you really push your limits for a long time for the case. So yeah, I'm 100% sure stem cell help. But I think that I need like, at least at least five more therapies. This is what I will certainly show us motion barfick shake bubble.
SPEAKER_02: yeah east versus west um east versus west 15 in my opinion no doubt the best it will be the best cars on the paper it will be the best cars you know uh no pronator doesn't get smaller if your wrist flexors get bigger
SPEAKER_02: it only looks like because you know you have a ball here but when the other muscles are so developed as well so it kind of hides it you know hello roman oh hello ending my friend my good good friend how are you good good and you we find very very excited good future for arm wrestling good future
SPEAKER_02: How did you like the cards so far?
SPEAKER_01: uh obviously i know i know more things that uh everybody else on the uh instagram but i have one of my favorite matches uh gennady versus mmt behind here this is one of my favorite matches on this card and also uh very intriguing one uh vitale versus serrano i'm really curious where these guys are yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: That's something that needs to happen, and I'm glad that finally it's taking place, because the way Dzeranov dominantly beat, both of them actually dominantly beat Rivas, and for me, not only just as a Georgii, but as a casual Armless Link fan, I would say Rivas was pretty good, I would say, against Dave Chaffee, and these two guys dominating him that much, I really want to see what they've done with these guys.
SPEAKER_02: hey he's here hello gennady how are you good good gennady how are you good yeah yeah michael says he's gonna beat you no chance for mike he just said he said he said no chance for me
SPEAKER_01: No chance for me. Yeah, but Genadi is coming back from an injury. Does he really think that he will be 100% ready? .
SPEAKER_01: he's saying that you're saying that engine as if michael is uh completely healed out guy really young just stop laughing and talking no no no first stop laughing and then translate i don't understand so he said he said you are telling me that engine as if michael is the one without any injuries no but mike michael had injury he recovered and he pulled three matches and every match he went
SPEAKER_02: better and better while Genadi is going to have his first match. Michael's first match was Lamparelli, Lars and Kamil and then Genadi. Genadi's first match is 136 kilos Michael and he is still growing.
SPEAKER_01: Genadi, I want to ask you something logical. What is logical? What is logical? What is logical? What is logical? What is logical? What is logical? What is logical? What is logical? What is logical?
SPEAKER_02: He kind of understood what you said, Engin. And he told me that those names, whatever you mentioned, they are not on Genadi's level. No, we know, we know. But that's what I say, that they started from there, there, there, there, going up. And Michael is directly pulling the hair away. That's my point.
SPEAKER_01: Maikli was able to beat you in the first round, but he was able to beat you in the second and third rounds. He was able to beat you in the first round, but he was able to beat you in the second and third rounds. That's right, Rishi and Abena are all the same. All Maikli.
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that you can line up everybody else as an opponent of Genadi and at the end Michael and he will have no problem reaching Michael. Oh, so he says that in the same event or different events? Same day, same day, yes. So basically he said that he's going to be praying
SPEAKER_02: And then he's going to beat Lars, and then he's going to beat Kamil, and then he's going to beat Michael. Yes, that's what he said. So he's basically saying that he's confident he's going to beat Michael. Voklet, I would like to thank my competitors in the first place. I would like to say that it was a great pleasure to meet you.
SPEAKER_01: okay um all the jokes aside uh huge respect to my opponents huge respect towards Michael uh me accepting this match and being confident as I am is because of how serious I take this match and how I will be uh preparing how seriously I will be preparing to show uh as best as I can against Michael yeah is it possible that like if you're holding the camera can you put it somewhere like shit
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that he was outside. He just came home and he has to charge the phone. So his phone is charging right now. Okay, okay, okay. Hey, Genadi, Devon said that Michael is going to beat you and he's going to beat Hermes. And then he said that he has a good chance to beat
SPEAKER_01: He said he has the best chance among all others to beat Levan. What do you think?
SPEAKER_01: Where is all this coming from? Are they seeing some dreams? Where is all this coming from? Is Devon dreaming or what's going on? I don't know about Devon, but Michael says that God is with him.
SPEAKER_01: I wish Michael great success and good luck because he's a really good man and good person. However, he cannot surpass me.
SPEAKER_02: Michael cannot surpass Genadi. That's what Genadi said. Okay. Genadi, for many years ago, you made a video and you said you know how to beat Michael. And then you pull Michael and you beat him. So will it be the same strategy, you think?
SPEAKER_01: Anu, how did you feel when you first heard that Michael was going to be here? You said that you knew how Michael was going to perform, how he was going to perform, how he was going to perform, and then you said that you were going to perform. What did you feel when you heard that Michael was going to be here? I didn't feel anything at all, but I was a little bit nervous, because I didn't expect to be here.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think it's a big deal, but I think it's a big deal. I think it's a big deal. I think it's a big deal. I think it's a big deal. I think it's a big deal.
SPEAKER_00: In my maximum form, which is called the maximum, I would say that I was born in the year 1990. And I was born in the same form. The only thing I noticed was that the muscles were very tense. It is not easy to do this because the nerves are tense and you have to know what to do with the muscles.
SPEAKER_00: I think that in this first tournament, I will be able to fix my maximum, but in my turn, I will have to use a different form. In this first tournament, I don't know what my maximum will be, but I'm sure that I will be able to do my best with Magida.
SPEAKER_01: So very positive message from Genadi. He said he's coming very well from recovery process. Basically, several days ago, he was speaking with his sister, how good he feels right now in terms of strength wise, how he was kind of surprised of his own weights that he pulled. He said that right now,
SPEAKER_01: um my uh bicep scroll in one hand uh is around 80 kg on right arm obviously and uh uh if we consider my max when was uh when i was in my best best shape this exercise i could do 90 kilograms so right now he's like 90 right now and he still has like not two months but one and a half months he has
SPEAKER_01: yes exactly that's why he said that for me right now it's looking promising uh and I feel I feel good but my biceps is still not on on on its 100 yet I'm not sure if I will uh get my hundred percent shape in this time or pulling Michael I will do my best uh however a good thing is uh that my uh
SPEAKER_01: wrist flexors in forearm muscle this nerve that is flexor nerve was somewhat kind of it had some obstacles because of how nerve was in between muscle cells or something like this how he explained it used to be like this before the surgery and once he did the surgery he could actually the during this surgery the doctors
SPEAKER_01: managed to free this nerve from this type of pressure that was caused by the muscle cells. So he said, long story short, my biceps is almost there and my wrist is feeling even stronger because of the nerve issue is gone right now.
SPEAKER_01: so he should have a nerve issue which after surgery doctors actually released in the tension of the nerve that was caused by other tissues so yeah and he hopes and he's uh he's basically like he said i'm sure after michael's match whoever is uh my match that's what gennady said i will be even better shape than i will show against michael i hope i will be 100 against mike but i'm not sure it
SPEAKER_01: But just seriously, when you say like joking aside, will he beat Michael? Genadi, how do you feel about what you just said and what you said to Michael and Omar? What do you think is the most important thing, Abir? Oh my God! Oh my God! Mike, you are great!
SPEAKER_00: He's saying that because of his opener skills, Michael is...
SPEAKER_01: Right now, actually, his sister is behind the camera and she listens to the conversation and she said that she is like giving a good luck to Genadi. She used to be in the auditorium when Genadi beats Devon and she's also coming to witness the Michael match.
SPEAKER_01: And he just said that every time when his Genadi sister is spectating Genadi's match and she is there, Genadi is winning. So last time it was against Devon and this time she's also come to support Genadi against Michael Todd. Yeah, but he didn't answer my question. I said, like, he made a video and I said, will it be the strategy? But you translated something
SPEAKER_02: that he said like his bicep is okay, his hand is better. That wasn't what I asked. I asked like, does he still think that that is the way to beat him? Like the video that he made it, that will be his strategy, technical.
SPEAKER_01: I did translate that, but he didn't mention. I will repeat the question. Maybe he ignored. Could be. If the match stops, I will do the same thing.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, when he said that if the match stops, does he think that match may not stop? We will see, we will see.
SPEAKER_02: well uh judging by uh michael's shape he seems uh he seems really good so most likely metro stop but we will see like the question is that i ask like if the match if the match like doesn't stop like it will not stop in who is his favor
SPEAKER_01: Michael's offensive game plan is nowhere near mine.
SPEAKER_01: He tried. Last time we had a match, he tried the offensive start to flash me, but it was vice versa. Michael is not on my level when it comes to offense. That's what Genadi said. Yeah, Genadi is not known as a super offensive guy either.
SPEAKER_00: Genadi, don't you think it's the right thing to do? Devon't you think it's the right thing to do? No, I don't know. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. Because if I know, I'm going to cry.
SPEAKER_01: That's because, Engin, you are right when it comes to Genadi being a champion in war. He said, that's because I want it to be war and I make it exciting for the fans and I make it stop and I'm trying to win the war and battle.
SPEAKER_00: If I want to do the flash and be offensive, the match is going my way.
SPEAKER_01: It was my fault, but he was the one who was wrong.
SPEAKER_02: he he he was saying uh you are my dog but uh we also at the end who was whose dog he says at the end we saw who is who is his dog yes okay we saw that one back then anyway so let me not get involved there and yeah so generally uh you are one of the
SPEAKER_02: strongest guy mentally and in heart that i have ever seen and this injury that you had will it have any negative effect you know like will it put any doubts in your mind
SPEAKER_01: Genadi, you mentioned earlier that you have a very strong mental strength. You have a strong will, a strong will, and a strong will. Does this mean that you have a strong trauma? And how does it affect your mental stability? How does it affect your mental stability?
SPEAKER_00: I would like to say that I don't have the courage to say what I think, for example, that I don't know what to do, I don't know how to do it, I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it, I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it.
SPEAKER_01: OK, good. I will speak in first person on his behalf.
SPEAKER_01: i am so used to the factor of being injured throughout my career right now i'm very used to be injured at some point at some level so right now i don't have the issue or in mental state that i would be afraid to get any more injured any more injured during the match so whatever happens i will not give up i will either win or tear up everything here
SPEAKER_01: However, my doctor told me and gave me the 100% guarantee that nothing would happen to my arm, like no matter how much I push my limits. Yes, yes. Is there any chance to get Michael here on the show and kind of piss him off? Let me ask. Let me ask him. Just wait.
SPEAKER_01: I'm gonna play some mind games right now beginning at this point if it's possible. There is no way he's gonna enter the chat, no way he's gonna come. But you know you guys will do the
SPEAKER_01: You guys will do the podcast together, like, later, after King of the Table. This is your solo interview, Genadi. This interview is for you. You and Michael, on September 30th, when KOTT will be canceled, you will come back to us. But Michael is here with us. Thank you, thank you. This is the case when I was in Davabne.
SPEAKER_01: Engin, I mean, it's good if Michael kind of gets prepared for himself before he joins the stream, so give him some time. That's what I would say. Okay, so let me...
SPEAKER_01: Engin, this is directly to you. He said, I will show up in Istanbul this time exactly the way you love, with my shoulders like pumping, like good, good fit shape. You know, like I think he refers to his prime shape photo he showed you once we were sitting around the table. Like he said, I will be like in good, good physical shape. Like, will he look as good as he looked during the Devon match?
SPEAKER_01: There is a super chat. Henry is asking, while his bicep was injured, did his press improve?
SPEAKER_01: During the period of your biceps, was there a lot of press? Was there a lot of press? Was there a lot of press? Yes, there was a lot of press. As I said, there was a lot of press. Yes, there was a lot of press.
SPEAKER_01: yeah this uh pressing skills are staying the same no no going backwards like he said that level has not dropped of being a good presser so he just his level dropped in biceps and it's like on 80 kg uh close to 90 kg his prime but press no issues but does he do does he do any table time because one and a half year he didn't understand we're talking about April
SPEAKER_02: 2023 and then November 2024 so we are talking about one year at seven months from yeah I mean I should say one year and six and a half months yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: You have a lot of experience, you are a very good player, you have a lot of experience, you are a very good player, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience, you have a lot of experience,
SPEAKER_00: He said that as far as you guys know, he told me Romani also know that I'm avoiding pulling top top
SPEAKER_01: guys in georgia i name super heavyweights i don't do sparring with them lately however i definitely do table times with the uh uh like um the uh below weight class champions in georgia and uh we do so heavy trainings at the table so so long sparring like one hour sometimes even longer longer than one hour uh sparring times that even 60 kg guys end up pinning me
SPEAKER_00: At the end. So he is doing a lot of table as well. Yes, yes. Non-stop one hour, sometimes even longer. I specifically asked how many hours.
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that he's doing the rounds of starting with the heavy guys, like stronger guys in the academy. And then he's doing this table, king of the table type of thing. Like he's staying and the other guy just spin, the other one, the other one. And he's doing the circle starting with the top guys and then going down to 60 kg guys. And he's doing like multiple rounds. And the last ones are like he barely even grips. It's so, so heavy.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, of course, they are in the form of new ideas. There were many years when everything was done in the same way. I mean, everything was done in the same way, because everyone was born in the same way, everyone was born in the same way, everyone was born in the same way.
SPEAKER_01: So these guys, even young bucks like 60 kg guys also are really good shape, in good shape. The ones that are in the national academy group members, they are really well prepared and they are good enough shape for Genadi to be aspiring partners in this style.
SPEAKER_02: non-stop pulling yeah yeah yeah of course of course when you get tired you get tired yeah I want to ask yeah I saw them in Moldova also strong guys you know Georgii uh I want to ask to Genadi um if Genadi wins against Michael just say early February
SPEAKER_01: Would he like to pull against Hermes like three months after Michael? Yes, but only if after Hermes will be Levan.
SPEAKER_01: If he ends up beating Hermes as well. Then the winner of this match pulls Levan. Yeah, that's exactly what he said, yeah. In that case, he will prepare for Hermes in three months period. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It is very important to have a lot of information about commerce, because it is very important to have a lot of information about commerce, because it is very important to have a lot of information about commerce, because it is very important to have a lot of information about commerce, because it is very important to have a lot of information about commerce, because it is very important to have a lot of information about commerce,
SPEAKER_01: So he repeated himself and added, yes, if I manage, like when I beat, like if I beat successfully my next opponent, who is Michael, and then I will be preparing for Hermes because preparing for Hermes will make me push my limits because in my mind, I would be preparing afterwards for the belt holder.
SPEAKER_01: whoever it will be he believes it will be level one so he said that if i prepare for hermes it will be because of i'm i'm planning ahead to be number one so i'm gonna train in a next next level type of way for hermes and then afterwards i would wish to also pull for the number one because i believe i i can i don't want to go up and down up and down in the rankings so i will prepare very good okay so he thinks that next spring
SPEAKER_01: He will put the title belt on him. So, Anu, you will say that if Mike Tsmoguev, Ömer Hermes Tsmoguev, Teberwal, will say that Gajsat Gazabkhulzev, Saobari, will be in the form of the first team? What do you think? No doubt. No doubt, Hermes Tsmoguev will be in the form of the first team.
SPEAKER_02: He said, if I manage to beat Hermes, it means I can challenge number one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, of course, yeah. So in spring, I will be ready for number one. I mean, so it is basically Michael versus Genadi match is like a quarterfinal. And then Hermes versus the winner of Michael and Genadi is semifinal. And then the next spring. We talk about Genadi. We talk about Levan.
SPEAKER_00: But what if Jerry beats Levan? Well, I would like to talk about Levan, but I don't think you can beat Levan. I think Jerry can beat Levan. I think Jerry can beat Levan. Then let me pull Jerry. Jerry, oh, okay. Whoever will be number one. I don't think you can beat Levan. I don't think you can beat Levan. I don't think you can beat Levan. I don't think you can beat Levan.
SPEAKER_00: I will talk about this topic in more detail. The topic is that I have a relationship with Hermes. When Daubrundi came to Dubai, I had a relationship with Jerry Cadorete. Jerry Cadorete was called Hermes and Hermes was called Laratma. I have this chance because
SPEAKER_00: I also have a limit in my body. I don't want to lose weight, I don't want to lose weight, I don't want to lose weight, I don't want to lose weight, I don't want to lose weight, I don't want to lose weight, I don't want to lose weight, I don't want to lose weight, I don't want to lose weight,
SPEAKER_00: That's because I'm the one who's going to make decisions, and I'm the one who's going to make decisions, and I'm the one who's going to make decisions, and I'm going to make decisions, and I'm going to make decisions, and I'm going to make decisions, and I'm going to make decisions, and I'm going to make decisions, and I'm going to make decisions, and I'm going to make decisions, and I'm going to make decisions,
SPEAKER_00: I don't like that at all. And if it's possible, I don't mind either. Because Michael is not the only one who is very good at sports, and has a lot of experience in sports, and has seen videos and photos of him in the gym. Michael is not the only one who is good at sports, and I'm sure he has a lot of complaints about something.
SPEAKER_01: okay um engine no one knows better than you of setting up the matches and no one would understand better than you uh that i have uh pulled uh heavyweight uh category matches the most at the east versus west i'm the guy who had pulled the most matches in heavyweight category at east versus west and king of the table he said when i was coming back from my injury against the iris so
SPEAKER_01: Throughout this, my heavyweight career, obviously, I have my last victories against Devon, who ended up beating Hermes. And my point is, Genadi's point, my point is to
SPEAKER_01: that i would at least deserve a chance to hit number one guy if i managed to beat michael who is clearly preparing very well i have seen his videos and he's taking it very seriously he's coming in a good good victory streak so he seems to be in good shape so if i manage to beat that guy such a strong guy then i managed to beat ermis i think i deserve a chance yes yes yes no doubt 100 yeah and gennady said if that's it's good that you are saying 100 because he said
SPEAKER_02: if in my head if I know that I have to beat two guys to pull for the belt that would be huge motivation there's no other yes yes yes no doubt I promise you versus Michael match pulls Hermes and Hermes versus the winner of your match with Michael pulls Levan first guy so I don't know it is gonna be either Michael or uh Genadi
SPEAKER_02: Or why would I say Levan? You know, maybe Jerry will beat. Just forget about it. What does he think about it? First guy, first guy. First guy, yeah. So Jerry, like what does he think that Jerry, the way that Jerry beat Alex Kurdesha? Engin, can I also translate that you said that that would be the path for Genadi and then I will ask the question? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, it will be very, very unfair to not to say Genadi.
SPEAKER_02: you know if he beats both Michael and Hermes like anyone who is beating Hermes for sure deserves the world title match and and then Hermes also if he wins
SPEAKER_01: winner of like Genadi versus Michael also deserves yeah world title match but we don't know about the if it's gonna be Jerry or because Jerry is just very dangerous guy and Levan Genadi knows this can you ask yeah I will yes yes
SPEAKER_01: What do you think will happen to Jerry and Alex in August? I don't know what Alex will do.
SPEAKER_01: He said that he was thinking that Alex would end up losing because of the style. Does Genadi think that anyone who pulls against Jerry with pronation will be in trouble against Jerry?
SPEAKER_00: Well, with these views, with these views, I would like to talk about the water. I would like to talk about it. Because there were some things that I didn't like when I was growing up. I didn't like the views. These views that I had, I didn't have a problem with the water, right?
SPEAKER_00: This is the American version, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same,
SPEAKER_00: That's what I'm talking about, that's not a territory. These are the conditions that I have to face when I go to Europe and America. These are the conditions that I have to face when I go to Europe and America. These are the conditions that I have to face when I go to Europe and America. These are the conditions that I have to face when I go to Europe and America. These are the conditions that I have to face when I go to Europe and America. These are the conditions that I have to face when I go to Europe and America. These are the conditions that I have to face when I go to Europe and America.
SPEAKER_01: he said not everybody would be in trouble uh and again i personally saying that obviously i will be able to through the pronation also and without any issues be jerry right now considering the uh east versus west current rules and uh current conditions at the table uh pads pads and stuff because
SPEAKER_01: Right now, it's perfect rules, at least for me. That's what Genadi said. And if this will be the rule set, at least I would be the guy who will not have issue to beat Jerry like that. Because I had issue back then, but it was because of the... Back then, it was slightly different rules, and I was not kind of accommodated to that type of...
SPEAKER_01: free elbow movements yes i also did many elbow uh slight fouls and stuff and my opponent as well but i don't like that i would i would rather have a bit slightly more uh strict rules which which is right now it's best rules for for gennady himself said so under these rule sets and these table time table conditions at least i would be the one guy who will have no issues through the pronation to just beat um
SPEAKER_02: okay there is a super chat michael workspace east versus west 15 the matches announced so far is insane best cards uh thank you very much michael uh can you ask he's so he's so um ibrahim is saying what about vitali shot at levan my friend all of them will have their shots like whoever will reach
SPEAKER_02: to Levan. Levan is pulling twice a year. Whoever reaches Levan, you understand, the first part of the year and second part of the year. First part of the year, I follow this way and then the second part of the year, the king of the table. So, we will see if Laletin will reach there undefeated or Genadi will reach there undefeated or Hermes will reach there undefeated. We will see, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he talks about the card, you know. Genadi, I sent you the matches, the list of the matches at the East vs West 15. What do you think about the event? Good event? How did you like it?
SPEAKER_01: He is very, very excited, astonished. He is very professional of your job. He is very delighted to see the names.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, thank you. And Levan, how do you see Levan's and Jerry's chances in this match? How do you see Levan's and Jerry's chances in this match? It's not a big difference. Levan has a big advantage in this match.
SPEAKER_00: Levan is a great player, he is a great player, he is a great player, he is a great player, he is a great player, he is a great player, he is a great player, he is a great player, he is a great player,
SPEAKER_01: Well, Levan's at least first advantage is that he will be heavier guy and usually that one has disadvantage against any of his opponents that he is bigger guy coming to the match. And also it's extremely hard to grip up against Levan because of how huge his hand is.
SPEAKER_01: And also, obviously, his strength. That's what Genadi said. These three factors will be crucial that would play the role against beating Jerry. So he thinks, he believes that Lewand is going to end up beating Jerry.
SPEAKER_01: But he said that I would not like to say in details how much I think would go. I believe people would love to see them show like good non-dominant fashion, but like war type of game, war type of show and match. So I think that people will get what they want. So in other words, Genadi said that he believes it will not be easy, but Levan will be winning. But Genadi...
SPEAKER_02: Do you think that if the match is not easy, if it is a war, do you think that Levan can win? Because if it is a war, it means that Jerry put the shoulder. Do you think that Levan has better endurance than Jerry? It's interesting to say that. Yes, it's clear that there will be a show and people won't think that there will be a show.
SPEAKER_01: This means that Jerry will be able to move to the next position. In this case, do you think that Levan will be able to overcome Jerry Sasso? And do you think that Jerry will be able to move to the next position? I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. If Jerry moves to Levan and stays in that position, everyone will agree with him.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Here's the thing, Engin. Ah, so, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Here's the thing, again, me and the one we spoke about his upcoming match against Jerry,
SPEAKER_01: And obviously I have pulled Jerry. I know Jerry's style. I know Jerry's arm. I know Jerry's hand. And Lewand knows Jerry's hand well enough to know a good game plan against him. He said, Genadi said, if Jerry ends up getting in his favorite position against Lewand, the match will stop. That's what he believes.
SPEAKER_01: and there will be a war and most likely he thinks that Jerry won't get there because Lewan knows how to execute the plan against him because Lewan knows Jerry's hand throughout me because I have proved already Jerry and we spoke about them and we analyzed possible outcomes.
SPEAKER_00: This is one of the reasons why Levan is a great sportsman. Levan is a great sportsman. Levan is a great sportsman.
SPEAKER_00: If we consider the fact that Levan was forced to do something against his own will, then we can say that Levan did a very good job. He was forced to do something.
SPEAKER_00: If I were to go to Lebanon, I would not go to Lebanon. I would go there, I would go there, I would go there, I would go there, I would go there, I would go there, I would go there, I would go there, I would go there, I would go there, I would go there, I would go there, I would go there, I would go there,
SPEAKER_00: That's it. There's no need to worry about it. It's a great idea. He worked in Tavistán for many years, and I think everything will work out, because the first one was in Tsoflio. The first thing to do is to go to Majamotexil, go there, and then go back to Tito Nmeri. If you go there, you won't go back.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. I will translate everything, Engi, no problem. He said, Lewand today is not the guy that he used to be eight years ago. And Genadi precisely mentioned, I just asked him and made sure. He said, the way I used to beat him, for instance, in flop press, today there's no chance that in supermatch style you end up beating Lewand like this. Because Lewand right now,
SPEAKER_01: uh is refined throughout his career in all angles back then he used to have weaknesses there were some angles that he was not precise and he did not know how to execute however today leon is not only the dominant guy at the table but also a warrior for instance the reason why i'm saying this is because i know leon can adjust for instance we have seen him against devon first round
SPEAKER_02: However, we saw him against Ermes.
SPEAKER_01: I will ask him. I will finish also what he said, and then I will ask him. He said that last two years, especially, Lewand worked hard on the angles, on the versatility, on his endurance as well. And today, he can adjust in the different styles. If Jerry manages to press him first round, then next round, in Genadi's opinion, obviously, Lewand will straightforward go in biceps.
SPEAKER_01: okay if biceps will not work then hit in the shoulder so basically i will ask your question no no no need because i understand so basically he says that even if he gets pressed that way so he will try something different yeah definitely he said that in ghana's opinion second if first round goes like this second round most likely one himself will go in pizzas because he knows approximately jerry's arm and he also knows his own capabilities so
SPEAKER_00: yeah if he who won't work he will himself and you obviously know about this
SPEAKER_00: Yes, but I don't want to say that I don't like it, but I don't want to say that I don't like it, because I worked hard, I worked hard, I worked hard on everything, and I don't know any professionals in Lebanon, and the illusion is that when you go abroad, you can't go to Lebanon. Yes.
SPEAKER_01: He reminded everybody else that last match him versus Levan was at Europeans in final when Genadi himself tried to beat him in old-fashioned that he used to beat Levan in like giving the match. And Levan did not allow Genadi to press him and end up Levan end up winning and
SPEAKER_01: Genadi said, I really wish to beat him like that, but I could not. And if anybody has the illusion that out of nowhere, this version of Lewand will lose all rounds in Supermatch straight forward, the same style, it's just, that's not something that Genadi sees in Lewand's future. I understand. Let's talk about King of the Table, upcoming King of the Table. Nice card, awesome card. Yeah, very nice card, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And first of all, let's start with Nugo, Nugo and RavVision. Oh, yeah. Kena, what do you think? Can you tell us about King of the Tables? First of all, what do you think about RavVision Jr. and Nugo? What do you think? What I think about Nugo in terms of his form? He's a hero. He's a hero.
SPEAKER_01: He knows Nugo, he knows Nugo and Nugo's shape and the way he sees this match it's gonna go in Nugo's favor because he's a tremendously good strong guy in good shape. Okay and let's talk about Kamil Jablonski versus Corey West.
SPEAKER_01: This one is left-handed, obviously, I would just remind him.
SPEAKER_01: He believes that Corey will be victorious, but it will be tough. It will not be an easy win. Oh, he says Corey is going to win? Yes, he thinks Corey will win, but it will be a battle. It will not be like 3-0 or something. He pulled in the last East Versus West card against Travis. He was in good shape. If he ends up in that shape, he has a good chance to win.
SPEAKER_02: yeah he will probably be in even better shape but let's see and these these two are my favorite matches first of all kalinchenko versus georgie swedco he is rooting for george but let me ask what he thinks who will win
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he thinks also that Zlatko would win. He's a good person, good guy. I mean, Genadi knows him better than he knows Karlin, maybe that's why. Okay. And Alex Kurdecha versus Morozov.
SPEAKER_01: They are both my brothers, my good friends. This one, I don't pick their favorite side, but I think Morozov will win.
SPEAKER_00: I asked him if there would be an easy win or not, and he said, no, not easy, but there would definitely be a fight. It's a difficult situation, and it's a big one, but... For example, if you think about it, a year later, and the Kurds are at war, you can imagine that the Kurds would be in a very bad situation. But it wasn't like that during the war.
SPEAKER_01: He thinks that it is possible that Alex wins. However, if you had asked me this question one year later, I would give Alex more credit.
SPEAKER_01: yeah and also he just said that recently uh alex also had uh matches and we have seen his shape and we know morozov's uh shape and uh uh again other things that uh right now like in in this card uh morozov has more chances to win yeah um but like and he won't be surprised if alex wins yeah he also said yes
SPEAKER_00: And Devon versus Leonidas, left turn. Good answer.
SPEAKER_01: No matter who Daewon is pulling, Daewon must not lose. I would be the guy who will beat him first. Even if it's like a leg wrestle, Daewon must win against anybody else. He said, even if it's a leg wrestling, Daewon has to win against anyone because I would be the guy who will beat him first. That's what he said. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01: so i guess he answered your question about about he said that i'm gonna i'm gonna dry his blood up like i will be the guy who will annoy him the most listen listen he already defeated devon but looks like he still has something personal like he's still
SPEAKER_01: seem like he didn't get enough. You know, why is that? Because some people didn't accept that defeat. Great question. Genadi, .
SPEAKER_00: . . . . .
SPEAKER_00: Thank you very much. Thank you very much. But I want to say one thing to all of you. The more you speak, the more you speak. The more you speak, the more you speak. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_01: He said that no, it's not because of that. It's because that pulling Devon and preparing against Devon is a lot of fun because he said that nobody else is capable to
SPEAKER_01: wrestle with me in mind as Devon is doing. If I piss him off, Devon is pissing me off back. He enjoyed so much and he wants to experience the same joy again. Exactly, that's what he said. Not only pulling, he started by saying pulling, but also preparation, this trash talking, if I piss him off, he pisses me off and it's all fun.
SPEAKER_02: the other guys just maybe i i i do some videos and nobody's responding me or they don't respond me as devon does so yeah that's what he said he enjoys the entire process okay that's what he wants to repeat okay so let's let's ask him you know a few more uh matches and then let's finish uh maybe a few more from the uh east versus west matches that we announced
SPEAKER_02: Like, for example, what does he think about Ivan Ivan Matyushenko versus Alizhan Muratov match?
SPEAKER_01: Matyushenko and Muratov won 15 kg in March. This is, just to make sure, 115 kg, right? 115 kg title, yes. 15 kg in March and 1000 kg in March. Muratov and Alizhan. What are your thoughts on this?
SPEAKER_00: Why are you asking me such a tough question? My head is spinning. Well, Alizhan is in a good shape, that's what I think, because... I don't know if he will be able to win, he has a lot of potential. Ivan Matyushenko is a very good player, he can win, but... Alizhan's performance is not enough.
SPEAKER_01: Well, in this match, I would give a favorite to Alizhan because Alizhan seems in better shape to me right now. Even though Ivan Matyushenko is extremely fast, explosive, and he goes in hook really well, he puts himself in his good position very well, but it will be extremely tough to stop Alizhan's surge. So in Genadi's opinion, Alizhan will end up winning. I understand.
SPEAKER_01: And who's going to win the battle of the beards? The one with the shorter and wider beard will end up winning.
SPEAKER_02: What was that? He said in beard battle, the beard that is a bit shorter and wider will end up bleeding. Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay. And yeah, I mean, we will have so much. Yeah, this one. This one is very important.
SPEAKER_02: For me, the most important, I shouldn't say most important, but most exciting match of the East vs. West 15 is Michael vs. Genadi. Very important match for me. It's not a world title match, and I think I will have nine world title matches. Majority of the matches will be, more than half of the matches will be world title matches. But to me, if you ask me which match you want to see,
SPEAKER_02: You won't be able to watch any of them live, but choose one. I would choose Michael versus Genadi. But yes, that match is the match. But there is another match that is very, very important for the overall top 10 rankings, which is Vitalii Laletin versus Georgii Di Dzeranov match. And I know that
SPEAKER_02: Genadi is from the, I can say, the same training group of Revas. And then he saw that match, Revas versus Di Dzeranov match. And what does he think about Di Dzeranov first? And then what does he think about his chances against Vitalii? GENNA DIZEKER- OK. Genadi, I have a question for you.
SPEAKER_01: It's a great honor to be here with you and Michael. It's a great honor to be here with you and Michael. It's a great honor to be here with you and Michael. It's a great honor to be here with you and Michael. It's a great honor to be here with you and Michael. It's a great honor to be here with you and Michael. It's a great honor to be here with you and Michael.
SPEAKER_01: I would like to say that I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, I would like to say that Genn
SPEAKER_02: What's the weight cap? It's super heavy weight, right? Yeah, right now. He's just asking. How is it the weight cap for Vitalii Mesh? I mean, come on. What kind of question is this? Ask him if he's political or what. He understands what he just said. He says that it's Dzeranov's issue.
SPEAKER_02: It's Dzeranov's issue to gain weight. He cannot just gain quite the weight. Dzeranov is already over 130 kilos. Dzeranov beat 170 kilos. What is Genadi talking about?
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about it? It's only 10 kilos heavier, and it's normal that the guy is so... Rezo is in a very bad situation, and he's not going to be able to do anything about it. But if you look at Laletin's Z, you can see his biceps.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, he ended up beating Revoaz. Rezo's problem was not that he didn't want to fight in the tournament. He could have had serious problems with Laletin, but he didn't want to. However, in this fight, he had to fight with Dzeranov, because Dzeranov is a biceps fighter.
SPEAKER_00: But we didn't really know what was going to happen next. I think it was in the 80s and 90s. Rezo Sik came to Sitskhema, which is in Dubai. He was very close to us, he was very close to us.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, of course. There are three great sportsmen in the world. If you don't like Rezo Dzeranov, you should like Vitalii Damar. Dzeranov is in the top form, Laletin is in the bottom form. It's a big difference.
SPEAKER_01: Just because Serrano has beaten Revas the way he beat Revas, I cannot say and we cannot say that he would end up beating Vitalii. Because even though I think that Revas may have pulled better had he not broken his finger against Vitalii, it's still not clear that...
SPEAKER_01: Revas would beat Dzeranov any other way. So Dzeranov beat Revas. Revas had his issues, maybe his problems. Fair and square, he ended up losing. So Dzeranov is a good, strong guy. But Vitalii's hand is different than Revas'. It's the question whether Dzeranov's wrist...
SPEAKER_01: um uh integrity stays there whether uh he would lose his hand against vitality that's the question uh we know there are always inside poor uh and it doesn't know also temple outside as well uh so but at the end it's 50 50.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, he said it's the 50-50? So there's only two chances. Yes, Dzeranov can either hook or do deadrest.
SPEAKER_01: Exactly. I think you know what I'm talking about. How about, Genadi, how about they go outside and get a discern of losers, but with more like side pressure, with no risk, like this? Is it possible? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: He still believes that if Dzeranov tries any way outside pulling, backwards, slightly diagonal side pressure, back pressure, outside top roll, any cases, if he goes outside, he will lose against Dzeranov. His chance, like you said, you guessed exactly what he said, either hook, catch him and maintain beating him hook, or losing wrist but still pushing and pinning. These are two options that Dzeranov...
SPEAKER_02: Both are in good shape, he said. 50-50. We cannot say where will go the match. Okay, okay. Anyways, so Genadi, I don't want to take your time more. Is there anything you want to say before we end this podcast?
SPEAKER_00: Thank you very much, Arvind, for being here with us today. I would like to ask you to tell us what you think and what you would like to say to the audience. First of all, I would like to say that I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here.

It means that this is something that he has done, that he is able to create a large-scale relationship between the people of the region and the big houses.
SPEAKER_00: He was one of them. He was the one who took care of us. He was the one who took care of us. He was the one who took care of us. He was the one who took care of us. He was the one who took care of us.
SPEAKER_01: I guess his battery just got done. I don't know, but I heard everything he was saying. He's back, he's back. So I will let him finish if he wants to say anything, or I'll just translate. Yes, let him finish what he wants to say. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

SPEAKER_01: May it continue this way. He said, I am thankful what you have done for Armless League. And he just said, let's be honest. You are the guy. Let's be honest. Engin is the guy who brought Armless League from kind of dead. So like resurrected Armless League. And it's clear that even old guys, old guys of this sport are still coming back and pushing the limits and making exciting, awesome games.
SPEAKER_01: matches and this is this is all because of the uh uh your hard work so engine thank you for that uh also i wish uh everybody else to be active supporting this sport uh in likings in like watching videos uploading maybe also if they are um

SPEAKER_02: When people ask me, what is the key to success? And I say, it is the synergy, the coordination of the muscle groups. And this is the same in life, everything, the coordination. What we do, I do my part.
SPEAKER_02: You do Roman your part, Sol does his part, Genadi does his part, the sponsors do his part, and then hundreds of thousands of the fans, they do their part. So all together we mean something. Separately, we are not that effective. We are one, one, one. When we come together, we make one million.
SPEAKER_02: understand that that that is that is what i say so i also thank to gennady uh his support and thanks to all the fans you know for supporting me yeah even though there is like a lot of like a jealous dark propaganda they continue but um i think that it will not change anything you know just yeah
SPEAKER_01: I will translate briefly. I think Genadi is still there. He just may have video issues, but he's still with us here. Genadi, thank you for being here. Thank you for being here. We are all very happy to be here. We are very happy to be here. We are very happy to be here. We are very happy to be here. We are very happy to be here. We are very happy to be here.
