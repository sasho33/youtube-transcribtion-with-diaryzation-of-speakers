SPEAKER_01: Okay, guys. Hello, hello, hello again. Okay, guys, we just had like, over two hours podcast with Travis. And now
SPEAKER_01: With Artur Makarov and Ömer Farukh Kozakoğlu, we have another one. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I think... Ivan Matyushenko is gonna help us. Okay, hello, hello, hello. Top videos, hello. Drunk Eddie, hello. Alex HD. Bicep Plus. The Drew.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it was easy against Kamil. Maybe later on, but Aaron. Hello, Mofex. Aleyküm Selam to Cherkessia. And clerks, hello, Aaron, Lago. You cannot hear me?
SPEAKER_01: Are you sure you don't hear me? Okay, just guys, don't be like misleading, you know? Because... Let's go.
SPEAKER_04: live now and that's very interesting match very interesting match
SPEAKER_01: We just had a podcast with Travis. Travis is incredible, seriously. I mean, some people criticize him, but he's, I mean, he's very unique with his perspective about armwrestling. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: okay okay i don't know what is the problem one second um
SPEAKER_01: Okay, Ivan came. Hello, Ivan. Good to see you. How are you? Good, thank you. So finally work, the link? Yes. That's good, that's good. Thank you for accepting to help, Artur. I have kind of jet lag. I went to South Korea and my sleeping times are just terrible, you know, like I slept today 2 p.m. afternoon
SPEAKER_01: and wake up 5 p.m., three hours, and I'm very tired. Maybe I sent you the wrong link or what. How is the preparation? It's good. Thank you. It's okay. It's good? Yeah? You mentally feel ready?
SPEAKER_01: Quite, quite ready. Hello, Artur. Hello, Ivan. Can you hear me? Excellent. Hello, hello, Artur. How are you, brother? I'm fine, thank you. Okay, let's start now. Okay, let's start.
SPEAKER_03: Artur, how are you? How is the preparation? Where is your level right now? You understand, right? How am I doing? Yes, how is the preparation? How is your level now? Everything is fine, thank God. The preparation was straight, I would say, for a good five.
SPEAKER_02: Artur thinks that his preparation is almost perfect or even perfect. It is excellent. He is in great shape. Yes. So, he is ready to do his best. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Do you understand? No, sir. I understand. I think your internet is frozen. Is my voice coming? Yes, but your internet is frozen. No, sir. I mean... Artur, you see me? You hear me? Is my voice coming, sir? Yes, it is. Okay, but your internet is frozen. Your voice is coming, but it is frozen. Did you say you don't need to translate?
SPEAKER_01: I understand, coach. You don't need to translate Ivan's thing. I'm just asking him if I need to translate for him to Turkish from English. He said that he understands, so I don't need to do that. So, Artur, you said that your shape is very good. Is it better than your shape against Mindaugas? Artur, if you understand, you can answer in English.
SPEAKER_03: Ivan, to be honest, I don't understand. He's asking about the form in comparison with the training for Mindaugas. I think it's better. I added 20-25% more. He says 20-25% better. Than Mindaugas match? Yes. 20-25% better. Wow.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, if he beat Mindaugas when he was 25% less or 20% less, now who can beat him? Is that the best shape of his life? It's not the best form in his life, but the best for the last five years.
SPEAKER_01: In the last five years. In the last five years, yes. Okay, what was his best hair when he pulled against me five years ago? It was the best when you fought Engin five years ago. Yes. Yes. And he has hair, right? Yes. Yeah. And Ömer?
SPEAKER_01: He says that he has a problem. He says that he is in the best condition. He says that he is in the best condition when he played with me. But he says that he is 20-25% better than when he beat Mindaugas. What do you think? Does it worry you?
SPEAKER_00: He says that he is young, he just won the Worlds and now he has the East vs West and he is improving all the time.
SPEAKER_01: being young especially he's young in the sports um so he believes that he is also in his best shape um
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, good. Artur, the question. You lost against Cercaso and Alonsolev. You lost Alonsolev a few times. And do you believe that your shape right now could beat them?
SPEAKER_02: Or had a very close match? Some of those matches were already close, but what do you think about the shape that you are in right now? Endin says that you lost to Cherkasy and Alana a few times in recent years. Do you think you would have won with a better form?
SPEAKER_03: Would you be able to win now? I think I would have fought much better. I don't know how I would have fought with Oleg and Alan, but I think there would have been much more resistance.
SPEAKER_01: he's not sure about the result but for sure he is stronger and he would give a better fight so i mean or in short does he believe that when he is at his best he may be the best 77 kilo in the world uh 75
SPEAKER_01: right now the category changed 70 77 85 because we added 70 i didn't want to make 70 75 85 i put the 77 in between i see uh
SPEAKER_02: Yes, he thinks so. The belt is his, so...
SPEAKER_01: He's ready for challenges. We want Artur to believe in himself and be ready for everyone. So, Ömer, how do you see your chances against your opponent? I'm asking Ömer how he sees his chance against Artur.
SPEAKER_00: Now, coach, I have certain deficiencies. Of course, we are trying to recover them in all the trainings. Right now, I am more focused on the strong side than the strong side, so I think the matches will be different. I mean, I had deficiencies among the world champions. We have already tried to fix them. We are working on them a little bit. I mean, it will happen as little as I can reduce the deficiency. So I think my luck will be high. Of course, we will fight. I think it will be a big match.
SPEAKER_01: He said that he thinks his chances are good. He said that he had some weaknesses against the Aydar Khan match. But he said that he has been training to fix those problems. And he said that he is confident. He said that, yes, it's going to be a battle. But he believes in himself. Amir also believes in himself.
SPEAKER_02: He also thinks so. What did you say? He also thinks so, that it will be a good match. Artur, what do you think about your opponent? Because you are genetically gifted for armwrestling.
SPEAKER_02: And your opponent is the same way. So how do you see this match? What do you think about your opponent? You are genetically gifted in terms of anthropometry, apparently. Your opponent is the same. How do you think your fight will go? Maybe there will be a plus or a minus. How can it go?
SPEAKER_03: Artur thinks that most probably Amir would
SPEAKER_02: try to toproll him using his advantages. And Artur himself will try to hook him. But also Artur thinks that he can toproll as well. He can or he may try to toproll? No, he can. If he needs, he would toproll also.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. No, what I'm just saying is, like, is he sure that he can top roll? Or he will try to top roll? Because, like, is he sure that he will be successful? When you say, if he wants, he can top roll as well? No, he said that if he needed, he would top roll. If it's needed, he would top roll.
SPEAKER_01: He would go hook, but if it's needed, he would top roll as well. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. He would try to top roll, and then we see if he can or not. You understand? You go one direction, but you may not be successful. That's what I try to say. He will choose to go top roll if he needs. He would go hook.
SPEAKER_02: I understand. But if it doesn't work, perhaps... That's what I think he meant. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: uh he thinks the chances are rather low for uh outside for using his drop roll yeah yeah this is what i meant to say like he has the option but after he tries if he can be successful or not i will show that's what i meant to say yeah yeah yeah okay yeah but he will try to we you know i i'm organizer but i emma leaves 45 minutes away from me and you know augustine and
SPEAKER_01: some other friends, you know, and Ömer will be trained. And this Sunday, they will train again. So, I don't know how ethical it is, but I, right now, a little bit coach Ömer. And I know, I know the abilities of Artur. May that be a disadvantage for Artur that someone like me get involved? Edwin says that
SPEAKER_02: They have a small advantage, because Engin, as far as I understand, helps Amir in preparation, and he also fought with you and knows how to fight with me. He knows the nuances, he can tell you some nuances. Yes, yes, Engin told me about it, but in any case, he has a slightly different hand anthropometry and will not always be able to do the movement that Engin does.
SPEAKER_02: Artur said that he thinks that Amir has different arms comparing with you. So he will not be able to perform your move against Artur. It will be different. It will be different.
SPEAKER_01: But does he not think that because of the genetic gift that Ömer has
SPEAKER_02: It may be even more dangerous. Do you think that because of Amir's talent, his unusual anthropometry will give him even more advantage, well, compared to Engin? Perhaps, perhaps, I do not exclude. In any case, until you fight him, you will not understand what is better.
SPEAKER_02: He cannot say anything for sure before pulling. Yes, that could be his advantage. And for sure he is extremely
SPEAKER_02: genetically gifted as he won the Worlds. That's obvious. And that he has a great future. But still, table will show. Yeah. Ömer, Artur, can you show your wrist and forearm? Ömer, show your wrist and forearm. Ömer, show your wrist and forearm. Ömer, show your wrist and forearm.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but the hand, I want to see the hand. I like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Artur, now you're going to have your own medicine. Devon't worry.
SPEAKER_02: From the very beginning, you said that, what about Merson?
SPEAKER_02: What did you say? Sorry. Oh, he is going to have... He's going to taste his own medicine. He was giving it to others, now he's going to taste his own medicine. That's what I got. But it was not sure. Yes, it's really exciting.
SPEAKER_01: Ömer, will you be playing against someone like you for the first time? I will be playing against someone like me for the first time.
SPEAKER_01: I asked him if he has ever pulled with a hand similar to his hand.
SPEAKER_01: And he said he doesn't think so. But he is training with the heavier guys. And then he is used to big hands. And he doesn't think that he's going to have a problem with Artur about grip. And can you ask Artur, has he ever pulled against someone who has the same genetic gift? Have you ever fought with an athlete with such hands?
SPEAKER_02: He doesn't think so. So it will be his first time. First time. And does he think that he may have a problem with the grip?
SPEAKER_02: How do you think, did you have a problem with the grip with such a hand? Ömer said that he does not see problems, because despite the fact that there are no such guys in Turkey with such hands, he has always trained with heavyweights. So, in general, he is used to big hands. I also think that I will not have any problems, because it is easier for me to grip with big guys. Even easier, right?
SPEAKER_03: He doesn't think it will be a disadvantage. He likes to pull big hands also. And I will also ask him something that out of curiosity. Who is the
SPEAKER_01: In his category, as important, in his category, who is the athlete that... who had the strongest pronator in his category that he has ever met? I'm curious if it's me or not. Seriously. I just would like to ask him. What do you think, out of everyone you've fought in the category, who has the strongest pronator? Irakli Zirakashvili, when he fought in his category.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah. Yes, but when you pull Irakli, first rounds, first round when you pull Irakli, ask him first, when he pulled Irakli, was he in the same shape when he pulled me? That's just Artur. Istanbul, round one. Ready, go? Me?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes. With you and Irakli Redigo, he was like this. Tell him that I took his wrist much easier on round one in Istanbul than Irakli beat him. Ask him also if he was in the same shape when you pulled Irakli. First of all, what was your form when you fought Irakli and Engin?
SPEAKER_03: Where is the best? Firstly. Secondly, Engin thinks that he took your hand in the first round more confidently than Irakli. Because Irakli had a longer fight. Well, yes, I agree. When we were with Engin in the first fight, he punched me in the hand right away.
SPEAKER_02: He thinks that his form was about the same against Irakli and against you. But he agrees that in the first round you took his wrist with ease.
SPEAKER_01: But because first round he tried to hook me and then he went to tackle and he won. But when he hooked me, when I hit him, he took his wrist, like I thought that it was like too easy. Like I was like, maybe it was like 70% of my pronator power I needed. But whenever he pulled with the left and then my wrist was like bending,
SPEAKER_02: It was like over. Because I didn't train for that. I trained only... I thought he was gonna hook only. But trust me, on that day, if he would only go inside, like, there was no way, you know. Yeah. Engin says that if you only went for the hook that day, he would have won without a chance. But he didn't expect you to use the pull and spin, the upper element.
SPEAKER_02: And there he lost the case a little. But if you only tried to spin into the hook, then he thinks it would have been unprofitable. I just had time to rebuild at that moment. In fact, it would probably be the outcome. I just had time to rebuild near the pillow. He was lucky to change his technique.
SPEAKER_01: He needed, he needed and he was very strong and I didn't expect that, yeah. And I have an unfinished business with you, Artur. He thinks he would like to pull you. Again? Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Does he think that he is 2-0 against me or 1-0? 1-0 or 2-0? 1-0 or 2-0? Do you think that you won 1-0 or 2-0? You mean in terms of parafights, right? Yes, yes, yes. No, after all, the clean victory was 1-0, because...
SPEAKER_03: He was injured in the second fight, even though I flew with a score of 2-0. It was in the second fight. And because of the injury, he managed to slow down. It was a clean victory, 1-0. 1-0. He remembers 1-0. And tell him that according to me it's 1-1, actually. According to Engin, it's 1-1.
SPEAKER_02: No, you are saying English. Yes. I was tired. Come on. Yeah. What does it say? So you should pull. We should pull. We will, we will, we will. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Ömer, how much do you see your chance as a percentage? If I don't make a mistake right now, I think 51% is mine. I'm not saying 50% is 50%, I'm saying 51%. Because it's important for me to manage that excitement in the atmosphere. But I think I'll have enough power when I push them.
SPEAKER_01: To be honest,
SPEAKER_02: 55-45 for Artur? Yes.
SPEAKER_01: okay that's good that's good okay good luck ivan you will win greetings from croatia thank you i'd like to i'd like to
SPEAKER_01: And you also see yourself right now because we had the podcast maybe a few weeks ago and now from that time to this time your confidence grew same or less? It's a bit less. Why is that? I had some hard workouts and my arm hurt a little.
SPEAKER_02: it's it's a little no problem uh but when it hurts i uh your confidence whenever the pain is gone and then yes my confidence raises when i take uh anti-inflammatory uh yeah ibuprofen ibuprofen yeah yes yes uh then my confidence arises yeah okay and and when you take the uh
SPEAKER_01: ibuprofen then your confidence you think will be higher than last time i asked or lower or the same no no it's not high i think that 50 50 yes it's the best possible and what's your weight right now uh 115 i do not need too much yes just 115. 115 yeah
SPEAKER_01: okay anyway so let's let's go let's go to oh there is another one dino says let's go engine ah i don't know what it means but yeah um okay let's let's talk about the other meshes and we see now
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I'm just making sure that I will tell the matches in order. Okay, Irina Gladkaya-Brigitta, Ivan Fy. Artur, do you know Brigitta from Hungary? Do you know this athlete, Brigitta? I've heard about her, but I've heard that she's a pretty strong girl.
SPEAKER_03: He just heard her name and knows that she is strong. Difficult to predict. He thinks 50-50.
SPEAKER_01: Ömer? He doesn't have an opinion about this match. Let's go. Artur, Azat vs. Danil Ustinov. Azat from Armenia, Danil from Kazakhstan. I think Danil Ustinov will win. He had a different weight category at the World Championships. The athletes were more serious.
SPEAKER_02: I think that the victory will be for Danil. He thinks Ustinov is the favorite. He thinks he is heavier. And he had more difficult opponents at the World Championship. And that's why he thinks he is the favorite. Yeah, but this is 70 kilo category when you say heavier. Yes, I know. 70, right? They both fought.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no. Ustinov fought at the World Championship at 75 kg. But this time for the world title 70 kg. Yes, yes, yes. I understood that they will fight in the same weight class. But considering that Danil's opponents were more serious at the World Championship, and since they were heavier, I think Danil will be the favorite.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, but still, Danil pulled at heavier and more difficult divisions at Worlds. And that's why he thinks he has more chances. Ok. Ömer, Azat vs Danil? I know Azat's match because I played with him before. But I think Danil will be more aggressive. I think Danil will win with his strength. What will he do?
SPEAKER_01: I think that Chikadze will win here.
SPEAKER_03: I think Kachak will have a two-year break and it will be very difficult to gain good form after two years of rest. I think Kachak will be able to win in the future, but at the moment I think it's Chikadze. Do you think Chikadze will win as Kachak didn't pull for several years?
SPEAKER_01: Only because of that. And some time later, Aburzan could be the winner. But not now. Who was the super heavyweight that Ozan pulled from Russia? Do you remember that match was not super easy.
SPEAKER_01: I think Oğuzhan won some rounds. I think it was 3-2. Do you think that if Oğuzhan would come in that shape, he still cannot beat Nugo? Personally, yes.
SPEAKER_02: i'm not sure because uh as far as i i saw that match and i think we're going to have some problems against uh low hand top row with uh but later is that what is that 150 kilo guy right uh yes but uh i'm not sure that uh he's uh yes uh maybe i think he wants locator he wants locators to break weight over ferret and then i think in one of the amc events not so long ago he also
SPEAKER_02: I think they're about the same level, strength level. You're talking about Nugo and Leshuk is the same level? Yes, yes. But Leshuk is bigger. His advantage is his size. But I think Nugo has a good top roll and it's very uncomfortable for hook pulls. If you remember him pulling Chris Amir,
SPEAKER_02: he is very effective. And in this case, I think he can be dangerous for Oguzhan.
SPEAKER_01: First of all, we don't know if Oğuzhan is going to go inside. And second of all, I think the way that Oğuzhan goes inside and the way that Krasimir goes is different. Like Oğuzhan is like, like he can do that way while Krasimir is going like a deep hook. Yeah. Anyway, so, let's go Ömer. Ömer, what do you think about Oğuzhan?
SPEAKER_01: I believe Oğuzhan is going to win because he has a strong hand and arm structure. I think he is going to win. Ömer thinks he is a bigger guy and he believes he is strong enough to win that match. But they are training partners from the same country.
SPEAKER_01: We don't know how we are, how much we are objective about this. And let's go to the next one. We already know Artur versus Ömer. And now we have Dimitrina Petrova, Carolina Pettersson. It's hard to say. I think that
SPEAKER_01: 51-49 Dimitrina Petrova. 51-49 Dimitrina. Okay. And Ömer, Dimitrina Petrova, Carolina Pettersson? He thinks it is 50-50. Dimitrina right now is the current world champion of 60 and Carolina is the 65kg world champion.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg Zhokh vs. Betkili Oniani, Artur. Judging by the way Betkili Oniani fought with Artyom Ustinov, I think he will be the favorite. Betkili Oniani. Betkili is the favorite. Because of how he pulled Ustinov, Artyom. Do you agree with that, Ivan?
SPEAKER_00: I think it will be a close match, but I think Betkili is the favorite. What do you think, Ömer? I think it will be a close match, but I think Betkili will win as long as they can. I think Betkili will win as long as they can.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, he also thinks it will be a very close match, but he thinks he will not give up, he will have better endurance and win. And Tata Sings versus Kanai. Artur, do you know Yoshinobu Kanai? No, I don't know who he is. Okay, then, do you know Kanai, Ömer? And then, just to remember again, Ivan, what was your...
SPEAKER_02: Todd Hutchings, for sure, just because Kanai didn't pull for many, many years. If he was in his best shape, he would be really dangerous for Todd. You don't believe that people may be inactive, but they are experienced, they know what kind of shape they need to be? You believe that people need to compete? Yes, I'm sure that
SPEAKER_02: 99% athletes would not pull seriously or train seriously without any competitions. So you are saying it's impossible Kanai to bring here the best shape? Yes, especially under 105. I think he was bigger when he was in his best shape. He was in 110 or in supers
SPEAKER_01: I think in those times. When he had the World Championship final match with Ferit, he was in 110 kilos. And last time he competed in Zlocitur, he was 105 kilos, as I remember, yeah. Yeah. Okay, now let's go to Rino versus Tago. Artur. I know that Rino is a very good, strong fighter.
SPEAKER_03: He thinks Ibragim is the favorite, but it will not be an easy match. He thinks it will be a rather close match. 55-45.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, for İbrahim. Okay. And Ömer? İbrahim Stagola, Rino Masic. I'm thinking about İbrahim Stagola, too, coach. Is my voice coming, coach? The connection is going. It's coming, your voice is coming. The image sometimes changes, but your voice is coming. So, you're winning İbrahim. You're winning İbrahim, right? It's coming now.
SPEAKER_01: Is there anything else you want to add? Ibragim is winning. No coach, my internet connection is a bit bad. He thinks Ibragim is going to win. So, let's go. Davit Samushia vs. Vladimir Maiorov, Artur. This is your more familiar. I think...
SPEAKER_03: He thinks 50-50 match.
SPEAKER_02: It will be a future match. He thinks that Vladimir drew conclusions from the previous match and would be better now. So now it will be... But now, yes, but I think that last time it was also very close. It was also... Like first rounds were close, but he got exhausted later. Yes.
SPEAKER_03: But don't you think that Samushia is also getting better? Just remember from that match to his last shape against Samushia. Devon't you think that Samushia is getting better too? Yes, yes. After he fought with Samushia Andreev, to be honest, I was even surprised that Samushia went up, because I couldn't drag him into the hook. Although Samushia fights in the hook.
SPEAKER_02: He was also surprised how Samushia pulled Samushia Andreev. That's why he thinks it will be 50-50 match this time.
SPEAKER_00: Majority made progress and Samushia made progress. It will be a close fight. He says that he believes that even if Samushia loses early rounds,
SPEAKER_01: He will come back and win the Supermatch. Artur, have you ever fought with Maiorov? No, never. Let's go to the next one. Vitalii Laletin vs. Georgii Di Dzeranov. It will be a very interesting fight.
SPEAKER_03: I really want to see him. I think if Georgii Dzeranov can turn Vitalii into a hook, it will be a big problem for Vitalii. Because Georgii is very strong in the hook. But I really hope that Vitalii will start his fight and will be able to open the top. 51 to 49 in favor of Vitalii Laletin.
SPEAKER_02: 51-49 in favor of Vitalii. Dzeranov is extremely dangerous in hook, but he thinks that Vitalii would manage to grenade him. And he says that 49% for Dzeranov.
SPEAKER_01: In what kind of scenario is Dzeranov winning? The 49%? Outside, inside, dead risk? Can you ask him?
SPEAKER_02: How many times he saw Laletin being hooked and lose and how many times he saw Laletin lose by taking his send? Vitalii?
SPEAKER_03: They fought against Saginashvili, but Saginashvili won him over. Because Saginashvili himself fights over. This is, of course, a slightly different artillery. To be honest, I ... Ah, Ermes fought. It was also dubious there. They also fought over.
SPEAKER_03: I think Farid Osman. Farid recently. Not recently, maybe a year ago. Yes, yes, he was at the MC. But I think this fight can't be taken into account, because Vitalii was… Trapped. Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Well, his shoulder didn't work, in my opinion. Yes, yes, yes. He wasn't in his right form, and I think, well, it's not worth waiting for this match. No. But you see, it's still not so often that Vitalii was beaten in the hook, right? No, not so often. It's hard for me to remember. Honestly, I can't remember. I can't remember anyone beating him in the hook.
SPEAKER_01: He cannot remember anyone winning Vitalii Nkuk. So what do you think? What does he think now?
SPEAKER_02: uh he just uh remembered uh several uh losses uh and all of them were yes and uh he doesn't remember anyone uh i think you did right two times in a super match yes it was uh 2018 before vitaly was uh um getting
SPEAKER_01: His weight? Yes, he was smaller. But you were also probably 105 kilos or something? Because around those times, I remember, you were telling me, 105, 106, 107, okay. Seven, and he was 16 or 17. Yeah, yeah. So I think maybe in the very past, maybe Krasimir,
SPEAKER_01: maybe hooking, yeah, yeah. But he was lighter and he was too light for his height, you know, 90 kilo, 100 kilo around those years, yeah. And you, Ivan, do you think that there is a possibility him to design or to hook Laletin?
SPEAKER_02: No. And is there any possibility for him to start the match with Lodin and somehow stop him here like Ermes did? Maybe. Maybe. Ziranoff is very versatile and he can cheat also. And I remember him booking Vitalii just because Vitalii didn't expect that.
SPEAKER_02: It was on one of the votes. But from that hook position, he toppled out. But this time, if he cheats and gets into hook position, I'm not sure that Vitalii would be able to get out again. But I do not think that Georgii would manage to do that. Were you surprised when Georgii decided to hook Reva's round one fresh match?
SPEAKER_01: Yes. There was a day that I learned something new. And did he draw that in straps? I think he did without the strap, I think. I think, but I may be wrong. I may be wrong. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. We will see. What do you think, Ömer? Is it the design of Laletin Machina?
SPEAKER_01: He says that 55% Laletin is going to win and he doesn't think that the match will go inside. Yeah, we will see. We will see how it will be.
SPEAKER_01: Let's go to the next one. Irakli Zirakashvili vs. Georgii Tautiev. Georgii Tautiev is your teammate and you know his top-roll ability. Now he's bigger and he's pulling Irakli. Irakli is the guy who has the best pronator you ever met. So how do you see this match?
SPEAKER_03: I think that Heraklis is definitely a very strong athlete and judging by the last fights, he is progressing very much, but I think that Georgii Heraklis will be uncomfortable
SPEAKER_03: due to the fact that Georgii has very long arms and very long fingers. And this can play a negative role for Irakli. Therefore, I think, in any case, it is impossible to underestimate neither one nor the other. 51 to 49, I think, for Tautiev.
SPEAKER_02: He is sure that Zirakashvili is extremely strong and has one of the best pronators. But still, Tautiev is very uncomfortable, could be very uncomfortable for him because of his high level, because of his long fingers. And that's why he thinks 51 to 49
SPEAKER_01: to achieve, but he says that we should not underestimate any of these tools. So he is saying that Tautiev is the favorite. And Artur, Tautiev is also the type of person that is very hard to hook, but whenever he loses, he loses from here.
SPEAKER_01: I have seen him losing. He has beaten Plamen Dimitrov, but I have also seen him losing against Plamen. I have seen him losing against Viorel Dobrin also. So do you think that... But from other side, Irakli, huh, Ivan? Irakli is also never losing against the hook pullers and he's losing against the top pullers. I think they both are dangerous for each other. Do you agree with that?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes, we discussed and I also agree with Artur that in this case levels are very important and the wrist strength when they go top roll against top roll and I think that Toteev has better wrist. I'm not sure but I think that he could pronate
SPEAKER_01: But I am not sure that he will be able to win. Because Irakli can also pull without his wrist and that could be very dangerous. Do you remember that Kaltiev stopped Ibragim Sagov even win one match? Yes. Do you think that it is possible Irakli to apply stronger shoulder pressure than Ibragim Sagov?
SPEAKER_01: I do not think so. But there could be different situations. Okay. Artur. Azat wrote, Azat Srapyan. Hello, brother Engin. I am sure everyone will be surprised on the second of the month. What? Ivan, can you say it?
SPEAKER_01: He's sure that everyone would be surprised. Because they said that Azat will lose against Danil Ustinov. And Azat wrote that everyone will be surprised. Azat wrote that everyone will be surprised on November 2. Apparently, in response to your prediction. No, no, no. I will be very interested to see it. He would like to see that. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Iraklı ile Tautiev. Sen Tautiev'i pek yakından tanıyor musun Ömer? Tautiev'i görüyorum ama tabii ki Iraklı Tıhrabak Karşılığı'yı daha çok tanıyorum. Nasıl görüyorsun bu maçı?
SPEAKER_00: He says that he says that he knows Irakli much more than he knows Georgii but he has seen Georgii's matches and but he says that like
SPEAKER_01: Irakli at 95 kilos, everything will be enough for Georgii Tautiev. Did you see the match, the training match in Georgii, Ivan, between Irakli and the guy who had the final with Tautiev at the AMC? Do you think that training means anything or not?
SPEAKER_02: No, I do not think so. I know Eldar, he always loses at side tables. I've never seen him win anyone at side table. So you are saying in the real match he would beat Irakli? I would not say that either, but I know that Irakli always wins at side table and I know that Eldar
SPEAKER_02: always loses and also he loses at training he came to my gym and lost to everyone so i i do not think that he i don't maybe that's his psychology he cannot push his limits if it's not a real competition so so when i saw that i didn't uh yes
SPEAKER_03: Artur, Michael Todd vs. Genadi Kvikvinia. Taking into account the fact that Michael Todd, according to the video recording, I see, he does the movements of Dzygon Vorat. He does quite good, big weights. For some reason, I think that this will not save him.
SPEAKER_03: My favorite will be Genadi Kretvinya. If he gets in good shape. If Genadi gets in good shape, I think he will win. Artur thinks that if Genadi gets his best shape, he would win. And those Jevons lifts,
SPEAKER_01: which Michael does with extreme weights, would not help much. But only if Genadi gets his best shape. What he's saying is that if Genadi is in his best shape, the lifts, everything Michael is doing will not help anything. Yes. So he's saying the best of Genadi beats the best of Michael.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that Genadi's form is better than Michael Todd's? I think so. Michael Todd definitely has a very good form now, and it can be seen. But I don't know what form Genadi has. If his form is not excellent, then I think he will have big problems.
SPEAKER_02: Answer the question. Do you think that the best form of Genadi... Yes, I think that best shape of Genadi is stronger than best Michael's shape. But also he knows for sure that Michael is in his very good shape. He seems to be in very good shape. But he's not sure at all about Genadi.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, very quick question and quick answer. Artur, what is your maximum weight during this preparation? And do you think that someday you may have also be a challenger for 85 kilos if you are in good shape? What is your maximum weight in this preparation and how do you think you can fight 85 kilos? You know, my maximum weight was 81 kilos.
SPEAKER_03: His biggest weight was 81 during this preparation.
SPEAKER_02: This preparation he went up to 81? Wow. Now I understand why he is 20-25% better. But he thinks it was water mostly. And now he is 79. He thinks that it will be very difficult for him to gain.
SPEAKER_02: 85 kg, but he would feel himself good in this category with weight 82-83 kg. Does he think that he has a chance in that category? What do you think, what chances will you have in this category with this weight? Well, chances to take the belt?
SPEAKER_03: I think you need to try, but I think the chances are still small, because you still need to gain weight. For me, this is a very strong weight category, and it will be very difficult for me. I think I'm somewhere in the middle.
SPEAKER_02: he doesn't see himself at the top of this category just somewhere in the middle or even lower he needs to get some strength so he's saying that he would be somewhere between top 10 but between five and ten uh
SPEAKER_01: He also thinks it's a close match but he thinks that Genadi is the favorite but there may be a surprise.
SPEAKER_01: Ömer, what do you think in the future? 85 kilos in the competition. How many kilos do you normally weigh? How many kilos do you have to walk for 85 kilos in the competition? I'm walking around 80 kilos right now, coach. Well, for example, if you were 83 kilos, would you try 85 kilos? I would actually try 85 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. I asked him, you know, if he would think about the future 85 kilo, he said, yeah, he would consider, but in the future he is because he's tall, he's like over 190. He said he's 192.
SPEAKER_03: And then maybe in the future, because of his height, he will think of a heavier category. Artur, Alizhan versus Ivan Matyushenko. I'll say right away that it will be 50-50, because there are two strong hookers. And it will mostly depend on the endurance of a certain athlete.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure that Artur is objective. He thinks it's 50-50 and the main thing will be to get into a comfortable position in hook and endurance.
SPEAKER_01: Mm-hmm. Ivan, that's your category. You are the one who is defending the belt. Why do you think that you should be underdog? Come on, man. More confidence. Come on. I know the opponent is good, but you are also very dangerous. You are also extremely dangerous.
SPEAKER_02: So I'm asking you, you are the defender. Very difficult to estimate our power. Yes, we didn't pull the same opponents. Only Morozov, but I didn't see Alizhan pulling Morozov in two years, maybe. I saw...
SPEAKER_02: I saw him pulling him three or four years ago when Artem was small and Alizhan was small. And I'm not sure that... I know that Artem doesn't want to pull Alizhan. I do not think that he is joking. And that's why... Yeah, but it's different, different. You know, I understand, I understand. Like...
SPEAKER_01: Morozov is going with like a bicep. Your weapon is just the incredible wrist flexor that dominating the pronation and speed. Like if you were as slow as Arteon Morozov,
SPEAKER_01: i would just say you're underdog but you are not that slow you are like very very quick do you do you think that like your hand risk p plays an important factor in your favor i think that uh barista will be the most important factor yes
SPEAKER_01: Yes, because when you dominate this pronator quickly and then it is very, very hard to bring it back. That is your chance. I believe, don't get me wrong, if you start with Ali Can in the centre like this, I would say he's favourite. If you start in hook like this. But I don't think that the match will be there when the goal comes because of your speed and wrist dominance. But does it mean that you're going to win?
SPEAKER_01: I don't say that either, but it can just go. Like if the elbow pads were like a little bit bigger in Dubai, now we would have maybe, maybe we would have another super heavyweight champion. Yeah, because I think you have pinned him a few times. You get many fouls there. Yes. Yeah. Anyway, so let's go. What do you think, Ömer? Ali Can, Ivan. Ali Can.
SPEAKER_01: Your connection is very bad, Ömer. I don't understand anything. Okay, let's go to the last. Your voice is not coming, my brother. If you want, turn off the camera. Turn off the camera, it will be a much better connection. Okay. Now let's talk.
SPEAKER_00: The vibration is getting worse. No, the sound is good now. It sounds good when you turn off the camera. What do you think about Ali-San and Ivan? I think Ali-San is definitely less. As you said, the wrist control is very good. I think Ali-San is good too. I was talking about Matyushenko's wrist control.
SPEAKER_01: He thinks that Ali Can is going to win. He thinks that at that weight, he thinks that he is not. He doesn't think that anyone can stop him, but we will see.
SPEAKER_03: So let's go to the last match. Artur, Devon Larratt vs Petrenko. 105 kilos. Can you remind him the weight? Maybe he doesn't know, probably he knows it. I think Petrenko will win this fight. For some reason, I think that Larratt is not in very good shape right now. And I don't think that he will be able to beat Oleg. Petrenko will win.
SPEAKER_01: I think Petrenko would win. Petrenko would win? Yes. He doesn't see Devon strong in this weight. But how about if he cuts 7-8 kilos and then after the weigh-in, till the one and a half day later, he becomes 115 kilos or 113 kilos? What do you think, if he manages to catch up?
SPEAKER_03: from 112 to 105 and then return it back. Still? Well, with weight, strength also goes away. Of course, he feels good when he's a little heavier. Well, I don't know, doubtful. I can't say. But in this fight, I think Oleg will win.
SPEAKER_02: He still thinks Oleg is the favorite and he would win. He thinks Dovan cannot stop him. So it will happen for sure. He will become weaker with cutting weight. Even if he gets it back, still he
SPEAKER_00: So it means that the weight loss in any ways will damage him. Yes. Ömer, what do you think? Ömer? Are you coming, coach? I'm coming right now. What do you think? I think this match could be the last one, coach. I'm saying 50-50, but I'm saying we could still win. Are you favoring Devon? 50-50, but... I don't get it.
SPEAKER_01: Ivan, has your opinion changed since last time we talked about this match? And can you also remind us your opinion about Devon vs Petrenko? I agree with Artur. I said about the same. I think that Devon is really strong over 110. And every time I saw him at 105, he was not that impressive.
SPEAKER_02: And even when he stopped Prudnik, it was 115, I think. 115 in the weigh-in. Probably after the weigh-in, he went up heavier. Yes, even bigger. And I never saw him effective and strong under 105. And on the other hand, I saw how strong Petrenko is now. So, if Devon was 115...
SPEAKER_02: I would bet on Devon 100%, but not 105%. Do you think that maybe Petrenko gets tired because of four rounds or do you think he will just go through? I do not believe that. Only bad refereeing may help, but I do not think that it can be that bad.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so you are saying that... I mean, not a reference, but some... Before the goal, some things. Setting the grip... So you are basically saying that if everything is normal... Yes, if everything is fair, I think that Petrenko's side pressure will be enough. That's interesting, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so thank you. Thank you very much, Artur. See you in two weeks. Ivan, thank you very much. Because of the jet lag, I'm forgetting things. You know, I forgot to look for the translator. In the last 12 minutes, you decided to help. You're welcome. It was both. Yeah. And see you in Istanbul in two weeks.
