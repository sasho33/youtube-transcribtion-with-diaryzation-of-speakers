SPEAKER_00: Jerry. What's up, my man? Do you want it straight up and down like this? Yeah, yeah. Okay. How are you doing? Good, Joe. I'm doing fine. I went to South Korea and my sleeping order just became so terrible and I start to sleep in the morning and um
SPEAKER_00: You know what time I woke up? What time? Two minutes before our podcast time. That's funny. So how are you doing? You look good. You look big. Yeah, well, I'm trying. And this is only beginning? That's it. Still got two months. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And how is your form so far? Is it already better than August form or? Better than what? August form, the Orlando form. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm stronger and better than I was in Orlando. But, but then how come you won that dominantly? Well, I think, uh, you were bad for Alex.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I don't know if it was just stylistically, because he was definitely strong. And he tried to go outside, he tried to go inside. And the third match, I think just it didn't really go any direction, just my direction. But I think I was just ready that day. I was so pumped that it was in the United States. And I set off the crowd and the atmosphere.
SPEAKER_00: I just was so excited to be able to compete in the United States that I think that was extra energy that helped me get through. So that really made a difference? I think so. Do you think that Alex made a mistake with his strategy? Well, I think...
SPEAKER_02: I think he came in ready. There was no question he was strong. I just think that I came in a little bit more prepared. And I'm not trying to take anything away from Alex because Alex is a great opponent and a great person, right? But I just, I knew that I had to redeem myself from the previous match when I was sick and wanted to make sure there was no question.
SPEAKER_00: And that was my goal. My goal was to win the way that I won. What I meant is that the way that he set up an arm wrestle against you, do you think that it was a mistake? Do you think that he should do his own style instead? I saw him some close inside to you.
SPEAKER_02: He tried to come in real close, which, you know, I was shocked that he was going to try to come that close. But I didn't care what way he was coming. I was ready for whichever way he was going to go.
SPEAKER_02: Because I was unsure going into that match if he was going to try to emulate what Ermes did or if he was going to try to do what he does. And so I was just ready for whichever thing that he was going to throw at me. And then when I saw him come in and shoulders were right next to each other, I said, okay, it's just going to be a battle of power. And I knew I had more power. Yeah. And, but did you feel relief or?
SPEAKER_00: more nervous when he was coming in. Like... No, I was confident no matter what way he came. I was confident. And I think that, you know, him coming in the inside and close just made it, you know, my confidence level a little bit higher. Oh, higher. Yeah, okay. This is what I meant. Because there has been times that, like, people thought that coming in
SPEAKER_00: Like it was the way to beat you. And so like, that's why I asked you if you were nervous because maybe something different was coming. Alex doing shoulder press against Morozov with left arm, you know, I'm sure you watched those matches and yeah. But it seemed like it didn't work.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, no, no, I agree. Like I said, I didn't know which way he was going to actually go. All I cared about was I was going to be ready, whether it was going to be inside or outside. He was going to come in closer. He was going to back up and try to take me around. But either way. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: okay now i i said this before as well but right now you you don't look normal jerry right now what i am seeing there um you look you look huge seriously already and and i remember that we had a podcast after your um alex match and you said you will be
SPEAKER_00: at least 10 or 15% stronger than the time that you pull Alex. Do you still believe that way? Yeah, I'm already stronger than when I came in with Alex. I'm already much stronger. I'm ahead of where I projected myself. Is that because
SPEAKER_00: you are right now in your best shape of your life or you were not as good as you wanted for the alex match um well i was prepared for alex's match and uh i think
SPEAKER_00: Just now I'm stronger than I was then because I'm trying to put more weight on the muscle. I see that you look huge. Maybe it's the camera lighting. No, the lighting is different thing, but I see the size as well.
SPEAKER_00: You know, because your head looks right now very small compared to your body. I mean, not very small, but smaller than before, you know, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. I think I'll take that as a compliment. No, no, it is. It is a compliment because it's just like, since your head is not going to get smaller, it means that your body got bigger, right? Yeah, yeah. What's your weight like? The body's definitely bigger.
SPEAKER_02: yeah and i changed up the way that i work out and not not huge but just i'm trying to do different lifts and different uh progressively go higher in weight each week so
SPEAKER_02: yeah what what are you now three three twenty three fifteen three twenty three and a quarter right uh so three twenty five and uh so i i need to put more i need to put some more weight on now right but in the uh words of what ermine's you want it to be quality weight so uh i'll i'll take the game slow but you look lean you look lean you know yeah yeah you don't look like you have
SPEAKER_00: much water on you you look lean yeah yeah yeah i i see i see that that your shoulder line and everything i i know you you are under the light you know how to use the light well but yeah yeah yeah i i think this is this is the best shape i have seen you uh during this east versus west matches yeah
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I'll be in the best shape when that match happens. Because in two more months, I'll have plenty of time to just put some more weight on, put some size on, and still try to stay somewhat lean. The problem, I was cutting out a lot of...
SPEAKER_00: fatty foods and shitty food, but then I was starting to lose weight. So I threw that food back in. So we'll see. Yeah, yeah. And do you expect your opponent, Levan, how to say, do you expect him to pull against you?
SPEAKER_00: In the way that he always pulls or do you think that he will try something different? I think he's got to be pretty confident the way that he competes, but I think he's going to try to make sure that he stays out of allowing me to get in my lane. How will he do that? How do you think that he will try to do that? In which way?
SPEAKER_02: Well, you know, I think he's going to come a little bit lower with his hand. I think he's going to try to block me from being able to get into my lane. Do you think he will try that way? I think so. Oh, okay. I don't think he's going to try to go inside with me. I just think he's going to try to block me from being able to jump into my shoulder roll. But I'm working on a few things, so we'll see. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: I will tell you one thing that I talk with Levan and I'm not going to tell you what we talk, you understand? But he takes you very seriously. Well, that's good. Yeah, he takes you very seriously. Yeah. And you know, you are type of guy that...
SPEAKER_00: If your opponent makes a mistake, you can make them pay bitterly. You are a real deal. Either they need to do very good homework and have enough power to apply that plan. Otherwise, they will learn something that they won't be able to fix it again. That day they will not be able to fix it. They will need another day for that.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Well, obviously it's going to come down to who, who makes mistakes. Right. And, uh, I, uh, I got to limit the amount of mistakes I make and capitalize on any mistake that he makes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You, you, you are, I will tell you something that, that I think that you have advantage against almost anyone when you pull, because they are pulling
SPEAKER_00: against someone that they have never pulled before and then you are pulling against especially the outside pullers that you have pulled thousands of times you know yeah you know yeah like you are you are experienced you know you are your experience a few times you know people found a way to beat you but looks like you also learned from there and then got
SPEAKER_00: better so that you wouldn't make that mistake but you i will tell you something um if you beat levan oh okay sorry sorry i should say win right like cut that word out of your vocabulary you you pull many times here and every time before the match i said if and then you corrected me when um true you gotta you gotta visualize it right i mean if you don't see yourself winning why show up
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And so, but since this time, you didn't correct me. Before, you were correcting me in 0.5 seconds. This time, I corrected myself. How come? Is it lack of confidence, Jerry? No lack of confidence. I'm going in full-hearted that, you know, the intent is I'm going to win, right? And I know it'll be probably one of the toughest matches I've ever had, but, you know, I... Listen, listen.
SPEAKER_00: What did you just say? Toughest? One of the toughest match you ever had? One of. One of them. But listen, do you believe that match to be one of your toughest matches and you losing? No. No, no, no. If you look back, right, historically, any of my long matches and my tough matches, I came out the victor.
SPEAKER_00: Listen, I know, I know you like the encyclopedia, but the, uh, there's, there's very few times that I was in a long match that I lost. I've won way more than I've lost. Yeah. That's for sure. I can say that your ratio would be 95 to five, you know? Yeah. If not better. Yeah. That's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. You, you, you look, you look, yeah. People are saying that.
SPEAKER_00: People say that you look massive, you know? Yeah. And imagine that they still have like two more months, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I want to be able to, in two months, I want to be able to throw another 15 pounds on. And so if I can put 15 more pounds on, come in around 340, you know, that'll be the heaviest I've ever been. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think usually your heaviest is around 330, you know? Yep. And yeah. And I'm telling you, you don't look...
SPEAKER_00: like water weight. You look really good, like almost ripped. This is what I see. Yeah. We will see how that match will go. But I was just thinking, you know, whenever you look at how to say social media, especially before the Alex match, Alex Furdecha match, like,
SPEAKER_00: Like, a lot of people didn't give you credit. Like, every time you are, like, ranked up there, third, fourth, people were like, what's Jerry doing there? And what's Jerry doing there? And then I reminded them, this guy beat Genadi. This guy beat Georgii Svetko. And you are asking me, what is he doing there? And when you also pull Alex, and Ermer said that, and yeah, I need to pull
SPEAKER_00: Jerry again. Like, obviously, he was not 100% of himself, you know, when we pulled. But after Alex's match, the things kind of changed. Right now, people are like, okay, what did he do to Alex? What he did to Alex was impressive, and now people are not underestimating him. But for sure, top athletes, they don't underestimate you.
SPEAKER_00: right yeah because they know how dangerous you are and also i can see that levan doesn't underestimate you just because levan is such a dominant guy but but he's i think he's taking you very seriously yeah good i i want to be taken serious i want it to be a great match and i think the longer the match goes the more it's in my favor
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and it is best of seven for rounds. I think it will be incredible. Lewand got his visa, everything is ready, and time is coming. Is it definitely going to be Vegas? No, it's not decided yet. They are still looking. This is what I have heard.
SPEAKER_00: It doesn't matter. It will be in a nice place. And I believe that there will be minimum 1,500 people. And imagine that an American guy for a superweight world title. And this is the first time Levan Saginashvili in US. I think that the venue will be like moving. So I can't imagine the atmosphere.
SPEAKER_00: I can't imagine the support you will have on that day. Yeah, that's going to be super helpful for me. Yeah, yeah. Listen, I will tell you something. Some people like that kind of support. Some people feel too much pressure, you understand? Because they can't really focus because of...
SPEAKER_00: So much pressure, you understand? But look, obviously, you Americans like that for sure. Yeah, that is what, like I, you know, how long I competed in US, you know, like many years, six years. And I kind of felt stronger when I was there alone. Like every time I go to an event, American event,
SPEAKER_00: there are 200 Americans and one Turkish guy, you know, referee is American, crowd is American, you know, all the support goes to my opponents, but it kind of made me stronger, you understand? Yeah. Yeah. I agree. But you always did well, so. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't have the video of our match, right, with you at the World Trade Center? No, no, I don't think so. You don't have it, do you?
SPEAKER_00: No, I wish I had it. Yeah. It would be, it would be good memory. Yeah. Yeah. I have the trophy as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And at that time you were already a heavyweight world champion from Irina and I was 143 world champion. Yeah. Anyways, Jerry. Yeah. Would you, do you have any, before we go to the predictions for the East versus West 15,
SPEAKER_00: Do you have any message? We will have you and Lewand in the same podcast as well. But let the time right now, each of you separately. And then when the time comes, maybe you guys come together. Any message to Lewand? Anything you want to say? No, just bring the best version of yourself that comes in and make sure at least one of the matches go inside with me.
SPEAKER_00: After you made him 4-0 and then you want to try the last matches with him? Yeah, yeah. Well, after I've already established the win, you know, just go inside. I want to see what he's got inside. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is it true that you got a bit hurt before Alex's match? I got what?
SPEAKER_00: a bit hurt in the elbow before? Yeah, well, I was over training and I ended up taking the two weeks off before the match. I went down and I got a cortisone shot. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you rested three weeks? Yeah. I will tell you something. Normally, how long would you rest? About a week and a half. But it looks like, I will tell you something, if you had very long training
SPEAKER_00: session you know like like yeah like like months you have been training trust me taking three weeks off
SPEAKER_02: is not a bad idea no because i'll tell you as we get older right yeah we need you're trying to train at a high level yeah the uh the body's taken a pounding our entire life and then doing the heavy weights and then putting the time in and practice it's just uh it takes a toll on the body and uh so i think you're absolutely right i think you need a little bit more time off
SPEAKER_02: And but I had messed up my elbow from practicing so much because I was I was using bands and then letting people go and hit me and bring me in. So I would get like way down here, let them throw their whole body on and I would just try to rip right through them.
SPEAKER_00: in uh in doing that like i said i screwed my elbow up in uh yeah you be careful don't do the same mistake you don't want no no no no no yeah yeah yeah i'm cautious if i worry i would be more confident you know i wouldn't really like have doubts and say i need to push more and more and more i after you reach a certain point i don't think that you will get like
SPEAKER_02: even two percent stronger you know after some time you know like last three weeks how much stronger can you get i think you can get only stronger by being healthier you know yeah i think the only thing i want to focus on the last few weeks will be staying uh like stretched out and then not not become too tight um and then work on lighter weights so i really you know no injuries no nothing
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, see, look, normally people would be disrespecting you, you understand? Not in a personal way, but they are like, you cannot do it. Like, who is Jerry? You understand? To do something to Levan. But right now, whenever I see that a lot of people are like,
SPEAKER_00: supporting him. And one guy says that Jerry is carrying USA on his back.
SPEAKER_02: Hey, listen, I'm sure that that means a ton to you to hear such a comment. Yeah, yeah. No, no, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. And, you know, the intent is I want to make the U.S. proud. I want to, you know, go over there and do what hasn't been done. And to be able to do it on U.S. soil is going to be amazing. And so I don't want to let anyone down. And, you know, I'm sure the majority of the world is
SPEAKER_02: rooting the other way or picking the other way as a winner, which is fine because historically I've always come in as an underdog. But I plan on giving it 100 plus percent. You're better. No, that's the goal. I'm putting the work in, I'm putting the effort in. Yeah. When it comes to that table, I'm telling you it's going to be a war. When it's a war,
SPEAKER_02: If I can get into a war, I feel super confident, right? But I'm not going to go in overconfident. I'm going to go in with my mindset, my game plan, and just do what I do and then be able to hit him with everything I've got and then see if he's going to be capable of stopping me. And if he is...
SPEAKER_00: and it's a slow stop and it's it becomes a long match the percentage goes way up right for for me one guy is asking will we see 160 kilo jerry uh probably not 160 kilo jerry but probably 155 kilo jerry and i think it is a lot because we don't have any um
SPEAKER_00: The key for me is going to be... I was reading the comments, you know, and then to ask you the comments, and this one idiot saying Classic Engine ignoring his guests. And this guy, boom, goes from this channel. Because, idiot, you know, I don't need idiot. I need high level of IQ on the... Anyway, so Pauline says that, let's go Jerry. And...
SPEAKER_00: Danil Axelson says, let's go Big Daddy. And one guy, Philip, says, Jerry, we live in the same state. And Pulse Health TV says, Jerry looks leaner and bigger. Look at those shoulders. One guy says, do you have pain inside or outside of your elbow?
SPEAKER_02: Uh, the, the, the pain that I got is inside the elbow and it's, it's from, uh, the way I practice and the way I train and the way I've pulled for years and years. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so let's, let's a little bit talk about the upcoming event. Did you see the cards of the East versus 15? I did. I did. Not a great match. Good. Good job. And right. You always put together, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You did a great job. That's good.
SPEAKER_00: That's good. Okay. There is one Super Chat. Let me read from here before I miss it. Sorry about it. Okay. Well, well, Ms. Shreff, thank you for your Super Chat. Jerry42, all the best.
SPEAKER_00: Jerry, just concentrate on the speed and timing. Everything else should go okay. Give everything you got. I agree with you. I think I got to be explosive and I got to be super strong. Yeah. Brian Burzenski, Engin, where is your pronation at? It's on the same place.
SPEAKER_00: Nah, I'm joking. It's about 65%, my friend. People are sending you support. Ibragim says, Genadi said Jerry has no chance. How does Jerry feel about that? Genadi said, Jerry, if he wins one round, Levan won't lose the same way again.
SPEAKER_00: I don't exactly understand, but he says that Genadi said that you have no chance against Lewand. I think this is something that you would answer to Genadi.
SPEAKER_02: well uh i like ghanadi but i think that if i had one of my countrymen going against someone else i'm going to support my countrymen too i always support everyone from the u.s so i think it would be rude if he thought i was going to beat him or set it out publicly that i was going to beat him knowing that they're from the same country so he can he can say whatever he wants but let's remember i beat ghanadi so if if he thinks i can't beat him then he's just admitting that
SPEAKER_00: Okay, and let's try to, okay, I'm opening. Okay, the matches that you don't know well enough, you don't have to, I mean, because you will say you are not familiar. Yeah, but let's start from the beginning. Irina Gladkaya, Brigitta Ivan. Brigitta Ivan from Hungary, a world champion.
SPEAKER_02: Armwrestler, world champion, and Irina Gladkaya is also world champion. Any prediction about? I'd be totally guessing, but I think it should be a good match, but I wouldn't be able to guess who was going to win. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And right now we have Azat from Armenia and Danil from Kazakhstan. One is current 70 kilo world champion. The other one is current 75 kilo world champion. Azat was going to pull against Hunter, but Hunter had to cancel because of some health problems and he says he will be back. And so.
SPEAKER_00: The same thing? You don't know much about them? Well, no, I like that Danil dude, right? Oh, Danil, you follow him? Yeah, yeah, I like him, right? So I'll go with him. Okay, okay. And do you follow Nugo?
SPEAKER_00: I saw that, right? I mean, dude looks strong, right? So hats off to him. Yeah, yeah. He's pulling one of the Turkish guys, world champion, three times world champion, Ozan Koçak. Ozan is a strong guy, but the last few years he hasn't been around. You don't know him?
SPEAKER_00: I've seen him. I don't know him personally, but yeah, I've seen him. You have seen him, but okay, he's going to pull against Nugzari, the Georgii guy they pull against. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nugzari is a shorter guy. Probably he's a bit taller than 170 centimeters. It's like probably, I would say, 5'5". No, no, 5'7". Around 5'7", he is. Yeah, and while Ozan is your height.
SPEAKER_00: and the category is 231. Ozan also has very big wins. He has beaten Marcio. He was 189 at Zloty overalls, open class he beat Marcio.
SPEAKER_00: He has beaten Jordan Sonev. He has beaten Krasimir. He has beaten Plamen, Sasho, and some others like Tautiev. That's a lot of impressive names. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's also... But people are questioning if Ozan is in his best shape or not. Got it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So, I mean, it's a big question mark for everyone. So let, let me go to the next one because you, you don't know Ozan much and you don't know like his current shape, but do you have any, any prediction? If you have it, then tell us. Yeah, I'll go with him. I mean, based on if he beat, I like Sasho. So if he beats Sasho, I'm gonna go with him. Yeah. But Nugu, Nugu, Sasho is 90 kilo. When Ozan beat him, he was 90 kilo. This is 105 kilo category.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but I'm still going to go with him. You still will go with him? Yeah. Yeah, okay. And Artur Makarov is pulling the Turkish guy, Ömer Kozakoğlu. Ömer Kozakoğlu won the WAF over Aydar Han, but Aydar Han actually pinned him, but a little bit elbow fouls.
SPEAKER_00: Ömer is also like his hand is like same like Oleg Zhokh, his hand and forearm. But he's very young. He's still in the youth category was this year, but he skipped that, he directly competed the senior category. And Artur Makarov, you know Artur? Yeah. And like they both have gigantic hands, you understand? They have that and right now they will give each other,
SPEAKER_00: to taste their own medicine. Yeah, yeah. Well, I will go with Artur based on more experience. You will go with Artur because of, yeah. Yeah, you are going with your own logic, yeah. Dimitrina Petrova versus Carolina Pettersson. Do you remember Dimitrina, the Bulgarian girl with the hook? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: She's pulling against Carolina Pettersson from Sweden, and you know her for sure. Yeah, yeah. She was down in Arizona, I think, training too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Carolina and Dimitrina, they had the WAF final in 2023 in Kazakhstan. Dimitrina won. And this year, Dimitrina was in 60-kilo WAF. She won, while Carolina was 65-kilo WAF. She also won.
SPEAKER_00: And so now two world champions of this year will pull for the East versus West world title. What's the weight? What's the weight? 132. But I will tell you something. Carolina is the one that was 143 and Dimitrina was 132. And Carolina is pulling in Dimitrina's weight. But she was only 135 when she won 143. So she is not really cutting any weight.
SPEAKER_00: Do you understand my point? Yeah, I'll go with Carolina. She was 135 and pulled 143. Yeah, I'll go with Carolina. Oh, you think Carolina is going to beat her? Yeah, I think she wants a vengeance match from two years ago. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. In fact, it's only a year ago. Yeah, 2023. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, last year. This year, maybe one year and two months, yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay, you go with Carolina.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And this one is interesting. Do you remember Betkili Oniani? This Georgii guy, tall guy with the left arm, he beat, in the last event in Istanbul, he beat Artem Taino in 95kg world title match. Oh, yeah, yeah, I saw that. With the guy with the beard and like very calm looking, while he's pulling, he looks at his
SPEAKER_00: opening eyes you know yeah yeah yeah he's pulling yeah yeah he's he's pulling against oleg zog oh okay yeah for the 95 kilo world title oleg is the 85 kilo world champion yeah i know he is the 95 kilo world champion right now they are pulling for 95 kilos so oleg is going for his second belt if he can win while yeah betty will be defending his title i'll go with oleg
SPEAKER_00: You go with Oleg. In fact, two years ago, at the East vs. West 2, they pulled, and Oleg won, but it was a war. Big fight. Okay, you think Oleg is going to win? Yeah. Okay, do you remember Yoshinobu Kanai? I do. I saw the match. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But do you remember him from the past? His matches? I remember seeing him. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: He had some really wars with John Burzins, with Tata Hutchings, with Michael Todd, you know? I don't remember Michael Todd. I remember his matches with John, though. Yeah, he beat Michael Todd at Armors. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he beat, and then he was 3-3 against Rambetz, but it was 2010, not today's Rambetz at 62, but he was 48 years old still. He was in the conversation, yeah. Yep, yep.
SPEAKER_00: So they are pulling against each other with thoughts. That'll be interesting.
SPEAKER_00: If the match stops, trust me, it will be interesting because this Kanai guy can pull in any position, you know, like, and you need to really dominate him, you know, with the wrist control and everything. And I know that Todd is pulling also, not with total control, but with the pure power. It's almost the same way with Kanai. The only question is, where is Kanai right now after all those long breaks? I still got to go with Todd. Is it because of the logic or is it because he is American?
SPEAKER_02: It's because both. I'll never root against one of my own countrymen, you know? Okay, yeah. So I got to root for them. So I'd rather root for them and be wrong than root against them and be right. Yeah, you would feel like you're betraying? Yeah, I wouldn't want them to root against me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so here is an interesting match.
SPEAKER_00: It is, I think, especially interesting for you because both of these guys are shoulder pressers. Rino Mastich versus Ibragim Sagov. You remember them, Rino and Ibragim? Yeah, yeah. Ibragim is the guy that had a long match with Tata Hutchings and then he beat Chen Shou and he beat Sandri. He's a shoulder presser with a beard, you know, from Russia.
SPEAKER_00: And Rino Masic is the guy that he beat at our event. He beat Terence Opperman and then he beat Bacho in Dubai. And right now they are going to pull against each other. Yeah. And where's Rino from? Italy or something? Oh, Rino is from Croatia.
SPEAKER_02: And Rino is the current WAP World Champion. He beat Sandris in the final. Yeah, is he the one that just went on and said that he's pretty sure he can beat me? What's that? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I go against him. You go against him? Yeah. The poor guy must have bumped his head or something. Oh, Rino, are you around?
SPEAKER_00: Okay, Andre also says that since Rino thinks Jerry would be an easy win, then Sagov shouldn't be an issue either. Yeah. Okay, so you heard about it, that Rino thinks that he would beat you. Yeah, two people sent it to me, the link where I laughed.
SPEAKER_00: You laugh? Okay. Anyways, yeah. So you are saying that Sagov is going to win because the guy is thinking that way about it? Yeah, because the other guy is a mess in the head. I don't know where Sagov is.
SPEAKER_00: Samushia versus Vladimir Maiorov. Vladimir Maiorov is the guy that Travis kept calling him Alexander during the whole match. This is the guy that I think they pulled and I think Samushia won 3-1 or was it 4-1? I don't know. I think it was 3-1. But he was just coming back to arm wrestling after
SPEAKER_00: uh for five years of break and do you think that there is anyone that can beat samusha at his weight no you don't think no he looks he looks good he looks good right yeah a few people came very close like aydar han he was 43 match i don't know if you remember the match yeah from kazakhstan in the last event sasho also was war for two and yeah
SPEAKER_00: So you are saying that this guy cannot beat Samushia? No, no. No? No. Okay. Okay, now it's getting more interesting, especially for you. Vitalii Laletin versus Georgii Di Dzeranov. Seriously, like all of these guys over here, like I will tell you the comments. I don't know if you are seeing.
SPEAKER_00: Like, I will just go, Jerry looking freaky. Jerry looking swole. Jerry is looking real jacked. Jerry looking huge. Yeah. Nice. So I'm just saying that, like, you have momentum. And that's just me right now. That's just me right now. I got two more months. And then we should expect 5% more power, at least.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I've got my game plan laid out, so it's got me going up about, yeah, between 5% to 10% better. Jerry is machine. Jerry almost looks like he is ready for Mindaugas Theracitis. Do you know Mindaugas? I know who he is, but my focus is just on LeVon.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't want any smoke with Mindaugas, who is a GOAT. Anyways, yeah. So let's go with Dilal Etin in this, I don't know. I got to go with Vitalii just because I think he's on a mission and he's mad he didn't get this match. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. He told me that he understood why you backed up from his match.
SPEAKER_00: He said that he said that sooner or later... Backed out? Yeah, you will be... That's not true. You know I didn't back out of that man's future.
SPEAKER_02: you know i told you i told you i would have did both matches right and you said you said no because they're one month apart from each other yeah i said i'll be both i said i'll be both of them right i said i'll do that one and do the next one never said that i'm just oh all right never said that and i i think that you are probably the like like
SPEAKER_00: stylistic the worst opponent for him but who knows who knows you know i feel his his arm is so long it's going to enable me to to get in and we have never seen that i'm telling you like somebody needs to have this base they cannot build it in a few months when after they pull like 15 years this way over pronation and then suddenly go that way they can but it won't be enough
SPEAKER_00: You understand? He won't be enough. This is my opinion. So better, he better go like quickly sideways and finish you. Because if you just catch him at the center or here, then it will be very hard for him. And I think that it will be, it will not be so hard for you to slip from him. Yeah. Because his fingers are strong in this position when somebody is getting out, not when somebody is, you know, like going this way.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because your fingers are not strong when your wrist is bent and something is sliding here. Whenever something is going, it's easier to catch and put pressure. But we will see. We will see. I don't know. I think that match is going to go to strap anyways. And in the strap, you better hit and finish very quick. Yeah. Yeah. I'll go with Vitalii.
SPEAKER_00: What's that? So my prediction is Vitalii. Your prediction is Vitalii, yeah. Okay. And Irakli Zirakashvili, Georgii Tautiev. Probably, you don't know Georgii, probably, because Georgii has... I know who he is. I saw the picture, right? You saw the picture, yeah. He's about the same height of Laletin. A little bit shorter than Laletin. He's two meters. He's taller than...
SPEAKER_00: like many other guys. He's going against Irakli, right? Irakli, yeah, and he's a top roller. Yeah, he's the one that beat John and he trained with Levan. Who was that?
SPEAKER_02: Irakli, Levan's a... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Irakli is that guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm going with Irakli. If he's training with Levan, I mean, you've got the best training partner in the world, right? Because if it wasn't me... Yeah, but you can't calculate that way because he lost against Tatashins, he lost against Ongarbev, he lost against Dadikian while he was still training with Levan. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So it doesn't always equal to the winning, you know, but yeah, but he's, he's very strong for sure. Yeah. Yeah. I'm still going with Irakli. You're still going with Irakli. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Now this is probably the most interesting for you. Most. Guess which match I'm talking about. Genadi and Michael Todd. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well... Okay, okay, one second, one second. Are we going to listen to the patriotic Jerry or are we going to listen to the objective Jerry right now? Okay. Okay, okay, just one second. I took the jacket out, the patriotic Jerry jacket out, and now you talk and then we can listen to the patriotic Jerry after.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, if I was to be an analyst, right? Yeah, just an analyst. Not a fan, just an analyst, right? Yeah. I know Michael came back from an injury. I know Genadi had an injury as well, but not to the level of what Michael had.
SPEAKER_02: And I think Michael has been making progress coming back. And he had to because he had went through a series of matches where he lost. And then came back and just beat Camille. He beat first Lamparelli on April. And then beginning of the June, he beat Lars. And then on August 10th, he beat Camille.
SPEAKER_00: But I don't think any of those guys are Genadi, right? No, for sure. But who's Genadi Genadi right now? After he got bicep injury, now it has been probably 16 months, about 16 months. And this is his first match after the surgery. While Michael warmed up, Frank, Lars...
SPEAKER_00: And coming Camille. Yeah. Yeah. So how do you, how do you see, do you think that it is possible to be ready at his first match after the injury while Michael had three matches to warm up to this match? And did you see the recent photos of Michael? Yeah. I mean, it looks like he got, it looks like he put some size on, got big, huge. I think he's over 300 right now.
SPEAKER_02: Good, yeah? Yeah, yeah. But still, sorry about cutting you. Go ahead. No, no, no. I'm just saying, if I'm an analyst and looking at this match, I'm looking at it as the negative side is that, like you said, Genadi hasn't had any real matches back. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He's training like an animal and you know he's got to be practicing like one too. And I think Genadi's mindset is that he beat Devon, right? He had a war with me.
SPEAKER_02: Right. That he lost. Yeah. Um, and then, uh, you know, so I feel like he feels like he's in contention to be in that top spots and he's not going to want to lose it. So, and then in his mind, he's already beat Michael, which he did. Right. He has, he has the win. Yeah. He beat him. He beat him three. He's versus West too. Yeah. Right. So I think this match is going to be a war in, I am nervous for Mike.
SPEAKER_02: where gnadi is a warrior right but mike's a warrior too yes so uh there's no i mean me and mike had some you know huge battles you know five six seven minutes you know and uh yeah both of us in it to win it uh but gnadi's just he's a different breed right and uh so i think um
SPEAKER_02: This match is super exciting for me, and I think you put a great match together with this one. And I think it's going to be tough. I think whoever wins, there's no easy win here, that it's going to come down to a war. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_02: yeah but you you are right about uh that thing that you said none of those guys are gonna that's that's for sure yeah no because he had he needed those matches those matches were to get re-established and get back in the winning column you know yes yes and uh i mean don't don't don't take get me wrong those people were good good competitors
SPEAKER_02: but they're not top 10, right? And so if you're going to go after top 10 and then Genadi's all his opponents over the last whatever, a couple of years, all been top 10. Yeah. Top 10 super heavyweights. Yeah. The thing is that like Genadi, like he can pull and apply pressure in almost any position. If you don't,
SPEAKER_00: dominate him with pure power then if he balances the match usually it's hard to beat him like you really need to dominate him so much pressure that he can he cannot uh handle and i'm sure that match will stop that match yeah i don't have any question about that match stopping i don't see either one flash pin into the other no
SPEAKER_00: No. And he will go strapped for sure. And then we will see a battle. But I see Michael right now mentally well prepared. I see him like he's on a mission. You understand? Like he's just, yeah. And he's on a mission that like he wants to, you know, the winner of this match is going to, most likely going to pull Hermes.
SPEAKER_00: And then winner of that match is going to pull against the winner of UN level. So I get the winner of armies versus the winner of that match. Yeah. As you said. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. I love that mindset. I love that mindset. Yeah. That is, that is how you should answer. Yeah. That's good. That's good. That's good. That stubbornness is the reason that.
SPEAKER_00: you are at where you are right now. Yeah. That, that, that, like nobody can beat me mindset. That is doesn't matter. You lose or win that. That should be the mindset that, that is what I believe. And now I will say something and I want you to correct me quickly instead of me correcting myself.
SPEAKER_02: if you beat 11. listen i i was being polite last time to wait until you finish the sentence but you know right i'll cut you off but it's uh i'm not putting in the time the effort and the energy to go over there and lose right especially if it's over here i'm not going to disappoint i'm not going to disappoint my my country right that is that is the strong i feel the same about my country
SPEAKER_00: like in the past when i was dominating you know wow europeans wow europeans you know like i was feeling the like all the responsibility behind me when i was arm wrestling i kind of feel that you feel the same way and and i i know that you are from a generation that grew up with the those rocky movies you know and yeah well at least this isn't matches and on christmas so it's good
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that is, yeah, that is, that is. So you feel like, you know, it's not only you, that it is everyone who are supporting you. So you are, you have that, you don't feel it's like Jerry versus Levan match, but you see is more like, like you representing your country and.
SPEAKER_00: that you should be the victorious, I understand, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, I see the things that way as well. There is nothing toxic about it. Instead of having wars, the nations can compete in this way. Of course, after the match, we are friends, we hug each other, we shake hands. Yeah. I'll buy him a burger and a drink after the match. You will what? You will buy him a drink? Yeah, after I win, I'll buy him a burger and a drink. A burger and drink, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: anyways jerry uh let's go to the last two matches okay just say again i didn't hear a clear prediction you did you you were just thinking you were gonna get away with that but i'm not gonna let you get away yeah well we just talked about the nationalistic feelings right now so it looks like you will have your jacket on you what's that 50 50 55 45
SPEAKER_02: I think this is a 50-50 match, right? And I think that this match is going to come down to blood, sweat, and tears. And if whoever makes the mistake is the one that's going to lose. So you're going to see... Am I frozen there, my photo? Yeah, you can't see you.
SPEAKER_00: Is it only dark? Is it only dark? Yeah, it's blacked out. Okay, it's because somebody just called. I don't know why this happens when the YouTube... Anyway, so we don't have so many matches. It doesn't matter. Let it go that way. Yeah. What do you think about Ivan Matyushenko versus Alizhan Muratov?
SPEAKER_00: I think it's going to... You follow these guys closely? Yeah, well, I mean, to some extent, I've watched them, right? Yeah, you watched them, right? But I think Machinko, right? Machinko is right now the defender, 150 kilos. That's what I was saying. I think he's going to win.
SPEAKER_02: Malchenko is going to be Dalijan. Yeah. Okay. And let's go to the last one. Devon versus Petrenko. I'm going to go with Devon, right? And I think Devon's healthy. I think he's a little light, but he's going to put a little weight on. But what's the weight limit there? No limit.
SPEAKER_02: this is 231 world title yeah okay um yeah i'll go with devin you go with them okay okay i think devin's just uh his mind is he knows how to be and manipulate anyone anyone including you
SPEAKER_00: No, not me. Not you, right? Not me at this weight. Nope. Do you think that somehow you guys will end up pulling against each other? Not if he's smart. Oh. Not if he's smart. You would want to pull him again and avenge your loss? Probably.
SPEAKER_02: Listen, our paths will obviously cross. I'm always going to be friends with Devon. He's a good dude, and he's done a shit ton for the sport of arm wrestling. But, you know, again, I think, you know, if the paths crossed, I'm confident in my ability and what I would do, and I would win. But I think...
SPEAKER_02: know he's going to say the same thing right he's going to say that he could beat me no matter what weight he was whatever but it just doesn't happen right and the one time we did have a super match with each other the right side of the table won right and it was what three two so there's a there's a makings of another match there and i'm sure devin's idea is that you know he wants me to beat levon so that he can have a match with me right
SPEAKER_00: Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. But we will see what we will see. Like, like everyone has some guesses about the future, but we don't know what's going to happen with Genadi, Michael. We don't know what's going to happen between the winner of them against Hermes. We don't know like what will be with the winner of their match against the winner of UN.
SPEAKER_02: Devon. Well, yeah, we do. Oh, shit. But in a perfect world, right? Yeah. I win. I win. Then whoever wins Michael and Genadi's match goes against Ermi's. Then Ermi's wins, and then I get my rematch with Ermi's. Would you want to pull Ermias again?
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely. I want him to pull a healthy Jerry because I'm sure in his mind that he thought I was healthy, but I think he knows deep down that I wasn't. Yeah. Anyways, anyways, Jerry, let's we finish right now and I will have another podcast later with Devon.
SPEAKER_00: And he was going to be together with Petrenko, but Petrenko said that he will not have the internet till Sunday. Either I'm going to postpone or I'm going to do separately. We will see. Any message to Levan before I let you go? Just train hard. Come in prepared. And remember, you're coming to play in my yard.
SPEAKER_02: how much difference you will make.
SPEAKER_02: playing in my yard in the United States. I'll tell you, it was absolutely electrifying to be down in Orlando and have so many United States people there, so many country people. It was unbelievable. I mean, you packed them in, right? There was 1,000 people that made it in there. Listen, there will be more. Eight days ago, tickets were sold out.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. So every ticket was sold. So we had a thousand people in there. The room was so amazing and it was just packed. And then the energy in there was insane. So to bring that- Have you ever experienced such thing before? That kind of atmosphere in a room? A thousand people pay tickets? I don't think I've been in a room where there's a thousand tickets.
SPEAKER_02: We've had multiple world championships that you've gone to, and I think there's a decent amount of people there, but I think that these were fans. When you say world championships,
SPEAKER_02: Those are the people who came there to compete, you understand? That's where I was just going. To say, though, to have a thousand fans there, I don't think I've ever seen a thousand fans in the same venue, right? To have competitors there, that's a different story. They're there because they're competing and they have to be there.
SPEAKER_02: but to have people show up just to watch the event and have that many people and it was just crazy it's it's just to me i was super excited and then when you you know you had to literally the line wrapped around the building down the hall down the front corner i was like holy you know luckily i don't have to wait in that line i go right by but um it just showed that you know it's you you did that engen you made that happen so you know that was amazing
SPEAKER_00: We did it all together. says, Engin, do you promise to be at the next US event? I will do my best, my friend, most likely. Yes. Yeah, yeah, you're right. And I'm guessing next event, when you pull against Levan, there will be minimum 1,500 people, maybe 2,000 people.
SPEAKER_00: that is like when do you know what happened whenever because i wasn't there i watched the pay-per-view and i look at the crowd during the paper with the camera turned to the crowd
SPEAKER_00: And I said, I saw that that was the beginning of us becoming the mainstream sports because the fans are, instead of the past events that they were just paying people to be there and, you know, cheering, you know, this time fans actually bought tickets and went there to watch. And imagine the times that
SPEAKER_02: 5,000 people are coming to an arena to watch East versus West. You understand? Yeah, it's crazy. But it's coming. It's coming. You understand? And remember, Engin, it's not like you had 1,000 people from Florida. There were people that flew in from all over the place to come to this meet. And it was just absolutely insane. And then everyone's just so cool, which is one of the things I love about this sport, is, you know, even the competitors, right? Like, you can...
SPEAKER_02: You're absolutely against them when you're on the table, but before and after, Alex is just a super cool dude. Then the fans, we did dinner with the fans and whatnot. It was so cool. Just everyone there, they make this sport 100 times better. Sure, it's about having great competitions and great competitors up there, but the fans are the ones that make this sport amazing. Yes, of course, the excitement.
SPEAKER_00: And I am telling you, the atmosphere in the upcoming King of the Table in U.S. will be incredible. Incredible. I have no doubt, yeah. Absolutely. Anyways. Okay, Levan just sent a message. Levan says, Engin, tell Jerry if he wants to continue arm wrestling, he better skip our next match to stay healthy.
SPEAKER_00: I'm joking, joking. Okay, Jerry, thank you very much for your time and everything. It was great. It's always great to see you. And yes, you look in great shape. And I have no doubt you will be even in a greater shape.
SPEAKER_00: And yes, you have the advantage, home advantage, feeling at home and having the support of near 2,000 people cheering for you. And because of the time zone difference, everything will be in your advantage. And I think this is going to be a very, very tough day for both of you.
SPEAKER_00: That's what I'm praying for. Yep. You take care of yourself, my friend. Thank you very much. Thank you. See you guys later. Yeah. Thank you.
