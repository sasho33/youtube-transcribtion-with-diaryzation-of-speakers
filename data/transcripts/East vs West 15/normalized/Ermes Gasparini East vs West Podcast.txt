SPEAKER_02: Hello, everyone.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Hermes. Hello, Enki. How are you? Good, good. You? Good, good. You didn't sleep last night or what? What happened to your under eyes? Why? I don't know. It looks like... No, no, it's okay now. Yeah, I think, yeah. Yeah. Ah, maybe it's a bit, it is. Maybe because I'm tired today, but... That's what I am saying. You didn't sleep last night or what? What...
SPEAKER_00: I said you didn't sleep good last night or what? I hear another voice. You hear another voice? Two times my voice. You are hearing your voice.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe you get out and come back again, no? Ah, it's better, better. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Because too much power every time. Yes. Every time you come here, you are causing either internet problem or sound problem. It's just, yeah, it's just, yeah, you are, you are too strong. That's why. Powerful. Yeah. Yeah. Everyone says hello to you. Thank you all, all the guys. Yeah. So how are you, Hermas? I'm fine. I'm recovering very well, really.
SPEAKER_00: uh every time better the the shoulder and now in the middle of september we check with another test i would see with the doctor and if he will tell to me i can train more with more power with more weights i think but really i feel very better now
SPEAKER_00: A lot better. Let me guess, 123 or 124 kilos? 23, one kilo more. Yeah, I can see it. The arm is big, really big. Yeah, my hip is not bad now, really. I don't feel the same power when I'm in the competition, but I eat a little bit more now.
SPEAKER_00: A lot of cardio every day. That's good, that's good. Cardio is a very good thing, yeah. Yeah, really it's very annoying, but it changes a lot of things. Do you do the cardio outside walking or on the cardio machine? If possible, out.
SPEAKER_00: Out is much better. If it's out, you do it out, you know. The other one is boring. Walking outside is good, yeah. Yeah, I buy the, I buy, I buy the desiccate for the, here in the house, but it's very annoying to do it. Out here is very beautiful place, the mountain, you breathe. Yeah. Very quality air.
SPEAKER_00: yeah but really i fed when i sleep i sleep better when i training i don't have you know short brief like good good like this is very good oxygen is necessary yeah i i will show you something look at look at my hair now
SPEAKER_01: but you have more than me now yeah look at this look at me before really yeah yeah this is the photo was taken when i was do you know when like a week before you arm wrestle with devon you remember alden and devon came to yellow to my city yeah and here is i'm playing backgammon and you see like alden is watching yeah you look look at my hair wow and look at now
SPEAKER_00: One year ago? One year? This photo was one year ago, yeah. And this happened in February. Ah, from August to January you already had a lot of hair. No, August the photo was taken and in February I had a hair transplant. They took it from here.
SPEAKER_01: and they put it here. And now in six months it came to this point, you know. They say that until the new year it still will grow more. No, no, but now really two, three months ago not like this. Now very impressive. I think they need to come in Istanbul to do. Yeah, yeah. I can talk with the guys if you want. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I have, but it hurts a lot. Somebody says that Concrete Elbow is going to make now a new video. We'll say that. Engin has more hair than Hermes. Reap Hermes hair. Yeah. Rest in peace. Yeah, yeah. Hermes, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_01: Um, so you are saying that last time we talk, you, I don't remember how much you said that your, your hair was the hair. I'm not saying you said 80% or something. You said, I don't remember 85. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I tried a little bit to push with the weights, like pronation, rise, and I'm really, but I don't train from three months, hard weights.
SPEAKER_01: I have only 10% less now than when I was super big shape. Are you pushing yourself? Are you really pushing your best or you are just like... No, no, no, little weight. Like if you want to really push yourself, can you make 90% of the weights? With this shape, for sure. Okay, okay. I'm already 90% now.
SPEAKER_00: I already 90% of my maximum about the weight, about weight. You are already 90% with the weight. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Because the rise, I did the 57 and then now I did the 52 more or less. Yeah. So you are right there, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But if we start now every week to train
SPEAKER_01: With this weight, for sure, I will improve more with this shape. Maybe I will arrive at 54, 55. I will tell you something. This is just like a friend's suggestion. Unless you have a competition at this stage, just stay around this here. It will be good for health. If you push the limits, you are already unnecessarily harming the joints and everything.
SPEAKER_01: It's good to go with the, I don't know, healthy for some time and then you have competition and then you can push last two months really to the limit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, for sure. And there is a question, Jeremy Browning. Engin, would you make Brian Shaw versus John Bersink? Yeah, it sounds good since John Bersink, I mean, yeah, it would be interesting.
SPEAKER_00: It's too early for Brian. Yeah, but he's very, very strong. And John is very experienced. Because of the power, many athletes can beat John now.
SPEAKER_01: But his experience is completely another level. This is not weightlifting. It's very important, but if you are not super coordinated, then John is going to find a way and beat you. If he finds a weakness there... If you compare Leonidas with John,
SPEAKER_00: And you see Leonidas, how much weight he can lift in the gym. He was doing that weight almost like more than Levan, I think. Yeah, yeah. And if you compare with John, you think he will beat like nothing, John. But arm wrestling is very...
SPEAKER_00: It's very... Unique? It's not comparable with weight. I agree, yeah. Completely, I don't know why, but yeah, you can have some indicator, but when you are on the table, it's completely... I don't know why, exactly. You don't know why? What? Why...
SPEAKER_00: that they did like if you can push with the no no no no come on you should be knowing that like come on you are knowledge no no i know it is about the synergy coordination yeah coordination and the synergy of the mask and the system for your brain yeah yeah for sure yes and the technique and the leverage and many many things yeah
SPEAKER_01: But if you think that someone can pull like this 80 kilo and the European pull like this 20 kilo, if you pull like this, you need to... Listen, listen, the power needs to be a little bit closer as well. But what I'm just saying that, like, okay, Leonidas did this so hard, so he took John's wrist, but he was like this under table when John came close and
SPEAKER_01: put all his body pressure on his brachioradialis alone, which was already tiring because John was also holding him like this. So it is just like, it is not so possible to tell everything by explaining with the words, you know. Yeah, this is what I mean. This is what I mean. It's difficult to explain these things, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think that power needs to be close anyways. Because if the guy is very, very strong, you may not even stop the guy. But if you know, and also, if John wasn't so well-rounded, because not everyone can pull John. John did hook in that match, top roll, sideway.
SPEAKER_01: He opened his arm, he pulled an open arm, he brought his shoulder, did the shoulder press. He did everything. Like, like other than John, anyone who has the power of John, like may not do if they didn't have that experience. He just, he did perfectly. You understand? Everything. When I say perfectly, he didn't do everything perfectly because he wasn't strong enough to do that, but he still found what is possible to win. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think that the match that you and Levan had was very similar to this one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, really. I mean, like, not right from the beginning, but the point that he stopped him like this. Yeah, exactly the same. Yeah, and then he's saying, like, Levan was like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly the same.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I don't know. I only know one thing that like the hand and the hand control forearm and everything just like, like stronger than here, more effective will be whatever you have behind, you know? Yeah. Yeah. It's very important. Super mega important. Yeah. I.
SPEAKER_01: you i i have a question for you how do you how do you judge jerry versus alex kurdecha judge what is it jerry jerry versus alex kurdecha judge means like how do you what's your opinion about that match ah
SPEAKER_01: Really super surprise from Jerry because I never thought Jerry won like this. Never.
SPEAKER_01: progressed a lot since that time to this time and his shape look big and strong and do you think that he made a wrong calculation wrong wrong strategy or i said every time he is too big to do
SPEAKER_00: It's too big to do very easy technique for Jerry, for the leverage, for the size. I think you told this. You said this before. Yes, every time. Every time I say the 50-50 because I show Kurt Eker super big.
SPEAKER_01: But really, I never expected he lose like this. The question, may Jerry also surprise Levan? Levan said that to me privately, like I am not so experienced to pull against this type of guys. And he mentioned also about his match in the past with Genadi. And so do you think that if Levan
SPEAKER_01: also makes a mistake about calculation and strategy do you think that there is a possibility jerry to just and put him to this position here you know on the bracket yeah maybe for endurance maybe for levan he have a super power
SPEAKER_00: Maybe he can win with the top roll the first, second round, like this, maybe third round. But if he will do some mistake and he don't have enough endurance to finish the match, he will be in very big trouble. So you are saying that if Lewandowski makes a mistake, there is a possibility that Jerry is going to win this match? Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Really, when I
SPEAKER_00: When I had a match with Jerry, I was super prepared because it's very difficult to prepare with someone you never pulled. If you go with a top roll hook, you almost know what you can do. I want to talk about the upcoming King of the Table.
SPEAKER_01: And I want to talk. Yeah, there are some interesting matches. Like I saw Georgii in Moldova. He was very big. His arms and trapezoids, everything, he was big. And I said that Georgii, I think he's going to beat Kalinchenko. And then I saw lately Kalinchenko, I don't know, do you see the Kalinchenko videos? Do you see his size and everything? I mean, the guy is out of control, you know?
SPEAKER_01: And like right now, I'm not sure who's going to win this match. Like, I know that Georgii is more experienced and more like, like have better probably hand control, but it is impossible to underestimate Kalnichenko. I think he's right now over 130 kilos, maybe under, maybe even near 135 kilos. He looks huge. His forearm, probably the most impressive forearm. You saw his forearm?
SPEAKER_00: I think for this match, for sure, Georgii has more power on the wrist. And 90% he will take the wrist of Kalinitsenko.
SPEAKER_00: But after this, Kalinchenko is super strong in the bicep and the shoulder press. We can also do this one too. I put Kalinchenko 55%. How much? 55. Kalinchenko 55, Georgii 45. So you are saying Kalinchenko is the favorite one.
SPEAKER_00: That's very interesting because if that happens, we will have someone new. Because if you don't have the press, like Georgii, you can't finish the match. It will be maybe with the same match like when he pulled it with Jerry. Yeah. Neil Pickup says, evening Enigma and my friends. Hope you both are well.
SPEAKER_01: and ready for the next King of the Table and then East versus West. I have been away for a while, but I am back and looking forward to getting back in the mix. Let's go. Let's go, Neil. Neil is one of the most important person in the community, for sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He was the best commentator in the world.
SPEAKER_01: Did you know he was also world champion armwrestler? Yeah, yeah. I know I heard many times here in Italy. He came here to compete with my father and the many guys. He won in the first world in Gardona Riviera in 2001. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember. I remember they told me. In the same place I won right and left gold. That was my...
SPEAKER_01: One, two, three, four, fifth world class title. Uh, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so, uh, wake up, he says, Hermes for you to beat Levan, should you train your hand and wrist or just forget about the hand and wrist and just focus on side pressure and refine your press? Like everything.
SPEAKER_01: Everything, but if you just give the hand right away like this, you're going to lose the match. No, no, no. You need to give all your wrist power. I need to do something like Dave Undine. You need to give all your wrist power, and he needs to pay the price to take that wrist. If you just give it to him, he's going to... No, no, no. Yeah. No, no. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: A lot of people want to see the rematch. A lot of people continue to write. Yes, because you are the one who bleed him. I need to be prepared very super next time. I think next year, spring, in Chicago, Devon Saginashvili and Hermes Gasparini
SPEAKER_01: And I guarantee you there will be around 3,000 people, at least 2,500 people. And then, I don't know, who do you think Americans are going to support? You or Lewa? Me. You? Me, me, yeah. Why is that? Because you are... Because I'm a more happy guy. You're a happy guy.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay. I want to ask right now to the comment section. Guys, if Lewand and Hermes pulls, who are you going to support? Maybe it's not a fair question because right now it is a podcast. Not very fair. Okay, one says Lewand, one says Hermes. Two, one.
SPEAKER_01: two one three one i think four one five one six one six okay i can't follow i destroyed him really yeah because a lot of people now okay i counted all of them okay five people says aramis and 33 people said levan really no i see my friend
SPEAKER_01: We need to change the ranking, my friend. We need to change the ranking. At the top, at the top, what kind of flag, what color flag should be at the top? The top? Yeah. What color should be? Green, red and white? Green, white, red. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And do you believe it's going to happen?
SPEAKER_00: I think yes, really, really believe a lot, a lot. Okay. Really. I think if I will be prepared, I will train off my weakness, I will be with very good focus, I can do, I can do really. I understand, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But we will see. Now, more important thing to recover the shoulder. I don't want to take some matches and don't be 100% ready. Okay. Probably you want to be ready like January, February. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you think that you might be ready? First match I want someone not like Levi. Of course, of course, of course. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Yeah, we will see. We will see. Let's talk about the other matches. There is another match that is very interesting. We have Alex Kurdeca versus Artem Morozov. And Artem Morozov is another guy that something happened to the guy, you know. They breathe some air. Do you remember last year there was...
SPEAKER_01: Before he got stomach problem, he was getting ready for Levan. He also was very big. But now he's completely different now. He's different right now, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Your guy says Engin with hair looks so much younger. Just imagine if I was also shaved. Yeah. Just joking. Anyway, so who's going to win this match? Left arm?
SPEAKER_01: Morozov won and right arm because listen just because Alex lost against Jerry it doesn't mean that Alex is weak or something Alex just stylistically wasn't ready if you try to top roll Alex if you try to control Alex like with the wrist it is very very hard thing to do so Morozov is not Jerry so how do you see this match if it will be like left
SPEAKER_00: But I think Kurdeca is more stronger with left than right. And what do you think about it? Can you bring the camera a little bit up? You are getting out. And Morozov, I think he's the same. Or maybe... I think the right hand, the level is more higher than left. Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_01: I always think myself that I say why the right arm is having more attention. It is because the truth is competition level is also higher because there are much more right-arm people than the left-arm people. And I think that is why probably, but okay. Genetic popular, I think. So who's winning? It is 50-50, but now
SPEAKER_00: To see more like this, maybe a little bit more. But my friend, I saw these years, the size is not very important. We are not like a bodybuilder, you know. But if the size comes like... I put 50-50. Put 50-50.
SPEAKER_00: If the size comes with a healthy weight, you understand, it is important, but it doesn't mean that more, more, more. It's like Revas was 160, 165 kilos. 70, 70, more than 70. Okay. And then just, I don't know. For sure, more and more quality. You see the mask or everything. I saw Kurbeka last match, he had too much water.
SPEAKER_00: When you are too much like this, I think the body is not very healthy. You don't have a lot of super power. But I think 50-50. I think that if you would pull Di Serrano, Di Serrano would beat you. There is another guy from Canada.
SPEAKER_01: He bet on him, 20,000. Yeah, but I'm not going to bet, but I think he would beat you. The guy is so strong. I think he would tackle your wrist. It's not possible. No? This is impossible. How is it impossible? Alex did it, Laletin did it some rounds. No, Laletin, no, never. Not one round, no? Maybe a little bit, but pronation.
SPEAKER_01: Only Lewand and Devon. But Devon, I need to try another time. Again, okay. Can I ask you something? Would you prefer to pull Devon first or Lewand first? But Devon is right now lighter. But Devon today, he said that he was like, I think Devon is right now 115 kilo. 15? 15, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But with Petrenko for 100... 105. 105. How he can go 105? I think he's going to go 110 and then five kilo water cut. They know how to do it. Very risk to do this. Because I think you need to normalize your body with the time. You saw Devon's match with Chance.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think that if Devon would come to the Petrenko match with that shape, Petrenko would beat him in that shape, in the Orlando shape? But he's not going to come with that shape, right? No, no, no, no. Because they put the match one week before, you know, you are not very prepared.
SPEAKER_01: But with this shape, I don't think he was enough to beat Petrenko. But did you know that Chance also came here to Istanbul five weeks ago? He pulled against Ibragim Sagov and five weeks he didn't train at all until then. Not at all. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I think both were in good shape, but yeah. Petrenko super amazing shape, really.
SPEAKER_00: Petrenko can beat someone in heavy super heavyweight if he wants. Depends who. Not in top 10. Not top 10, but someone like, oh, I don't know. But really super strong. Yeah, there is another one. Corey West versus Camille. Left?
SPEAKER_01: yeah corey west like like i will tell you something vitality very strong hands but i don't think that vitality's arm is the strongest arm but of course he's very strong but um i cannot say that his arm is the strongest um so when when someone like camille is going like this your hand doesn't like you still i don't know he gives the hand already you don't need to take the hand you know
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Do you think that because he is bigger and maybe has stronger arms, do you think that Corey may have a chance against... Maybe for the size, you know, too much. Yeah, yeah, this is what I say. Big size, yeah. He can't go with leverage like Laletin. This is for sure. Because Corey West, he has very strong side pressure on the hook.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Left arm is not going hook. Left arm is more like hitting outside. Right arm is like more with the wrist he's going, yeah. But I think Camille will win. You think? Yeah, maybe for the endurance. For the endurance, I think. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: We will see. We will see how it will be. But really, this King of the Table is super interesting. Very surprising, yeah. And we didn't start yet. We have Nugo Shkazde. Oh. Yeah. Nugo is really super. When I show him his persuasion, you feel the energy like crazy. Yes, yes. I like these guys, really. With this energy, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about this match? I think Rob Vigeon lost very badly last time with Zurab. It wasn't very badly. The score was 3-0. But I think Nudo is too much.
SPEAKER_00: I think we will see. Yeah. And it will be very good fight to see for sure. But if I put a new, like a 70%. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so, you know, East versus West, the good, good part about it, that like you, how to say, like there is,
SPEAKER_01: You see your level when you come here. Do you understand? You know, whatever you are, you come and see at what level you are. The king of the table, East versus West. These stages are like, you know, Neil has an event named Reality Check.
SPEAKER_01: Understand? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So these events, really, there has never been any tougher level arm wrestling league, anything like this. And now everyone sees what's happening. And there is another one, Leonidas versus Devon. And Leonidas, his left arm is as good as his right arm.
SPEAKER_01: And I know that he used to be like this, but right now he says that he trained his right arm so much. Right arm is very strong, but I'm like, I don't think Devon's left arm is anywhere near to his right arm. People say that he beat Georgii or something, but lately he went down to 105 kilo level, very low level. And I don't think his power is his super heavy weight.
SPEAKER_00: time, you understand? I don't think it's at their level. And I just can't wait, you know, how the match will be. If Leonidas, he knows to do a press, he learns, he will win. But you say that there is no way to go out.
SPEAKER_00: Because Devon, he will go down with like something, like he move and he will stop the match, I think. He need really the pressure if he want to win. We will see. We will see how it will be. And let's see how.
SPEAKER_00: But for Devon, if he will win, Devon will be a super amazing, hard match. He will not be easy, right? No, no, no, impossible. Impossible. But for a very smart guy, I think he will do a very good match.
SPEAKER_01: I think that Leonid is very strong right now. John won against him, but I saw John before the match. John was really big. Huge, big. And he still put John into very bad positions. Schoolboy is very strong. Schoolboy is very, super strong. Another guy I want to see really is Kirill.
SPEAKER_01: Kiri from Russia. Levan told me that he visited Levan two weeks ago or something. He said he's very strong, he said, yeah. Yeah, yeah, Fede is super strong, really. When I played with him.
SPEAKER_01: Choke on wax, what is Hermes' next match and does he think he can beat Michael Todd right now? I don't know what that means. Maybe beat, he says. Can you beat Michael Todd right now, they are asking. And what's your next match? My next match, I hope it will be in January.
SPEAKER_00: approximately. Michael Todd now, very big share. I think Michael now is in his best shape of his life. For the size, the mask, all quality and the training, weight, really. And you know, when something hurts you,
SPEAKER_00: After that you become more stronger, smarter. But maybe in the future we will see. Do you think he can beat Genadi in November? Close match?
SPEAKER_00: Close because Genadi for sure will come back, not 100%, but it will be a very long match, very, very long match and it will be 50-50. I think to me whenever I look at the card, I send you the card, right? What do you think about it? Crazy. It's worth 50, maybe the best card, right?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Without Levan, really amazing. The combination, because you don't need to push top one, top two. You need to push someone, you know, to see value. Yeah, but there are, listen, when you say top one, top two, you're talking about only the super heavyweights.
SPEAKER_01: But there are seven world title matches, so there are seven top guys, you know, yeah. And, yeah, Levan doesn't pull, like, so often, so you can't really bring Levan. But what I'm just saying, generally, the cards, in my opinion, is the best cards, my opinion, because so many great matches in there. And I think Genadi versus Michael, just can you imagine the pressure?
SPEAKER_01: Like one side Michael and the other side Genadi, you know, Opana. I can't wait to see. You can wait. You want to come to watch or not? Yeah. Yeah. If you, if it's possible, I will come. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I have your, your,
SPEAKER_01: Passport, copy, everything I have is right here. How many days do you want to come? Thursday, Sunday? For the weekend. Thursday to Sunday is okay? Or you want to come early? Yes, yes. Or Friday morning. Friday is too late. I want you to be in the... Thursday is okay. Thursday, okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I think I missed another super chat.
SPEAKER_01: Wake Up is asking, Hermes, would you take a match with Michael Toth as your comeback match if he beats Genadi? Yes, it would be amazing because I lost last time with Michael. Michael. Yeah. And then Genadi is, Michael is beating Genadi and he is beating you, so he's becoming number three. Oh, that's interesting. What?
SPEAKER_00: Michael is beating Genadi in November and then beating you in January, so he will become number three in the world. Impossible to become. Why? He cannot beat you? No, impossible to beat me. Impossible? For Michael, no. I'm joking. You are joking he can beat you?
SPEAKER_00: Very, very small, small, small, small chance. Ten percent? Five. Five percent. One percent is not very lucky. It's better to tell five now. You said one percent to Devon, right? For the future, we'll tell five. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you, Zeus, for the super shit. Not the super shit, but just like...
SPEAKER_00: Why I can't put the heart here? Yeah, yeah, but for sure he will be if he will beat Genadi or Genadi beat Michael. Oh, so you are basically putting the winner of these two guys. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Very super amazing fight, really. Both super fights. I think they will... Or between Kalinicenko, Georgii. Super interesting. No, no, no, no. The winner of Michael, another match. Okay, no problem. I understand you are scared of them, but you want to choose... No? No. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And we have another one. Choke on wax. Hermes, will Devon go back to supers? What do you mean? Like super heavyweight. He will go back to super heavyweight? Devon? Yeah. I think 20... 26. Or next summer.
SPEAKER_01: 26? Oh, 2016. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Guys, for your information, we started to make it available. The East vs. West 15 jerseys are now available. Let me show you. Okay, there is something that Genadi just tagged me on this
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what he's saying, but... Bambino. Yeah, he has some messages for Michael Todd, I believe. And let me see. Yeah, yeah. Guys, these are the shirts that are right now in the store. Yes, they are very nice. We changed it, I think. Yeah? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I saw the t-shirt, top roll, hook. I asked Levan which one do you think that Hermes should wear. Levan said that this one.
SPEAKER_01: Ah, with him we put this t-shirt. This shirt, yeah. But maybe we should also put with Devon, round one. Yeah. Someone, his name is Lee. Thank you for super chat. Hermes, would you beat Brian Shaw in one year? One year later, can you beat him? If I can beat him? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think Brian, he need the minimum two years. Three years, yeah. Two, three years, yeah. Three years, and then maybe after one year from now,
SPEAKER_00: to start to do some competition. I think he can do competition early, but maybe he can come to the elite level in two, three years. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's better to put him with the same same experience guy. No, I understand. But same experience guys he can do already in six months.
SPEAKER_00: but he can reach to the elite level three years later. But right now, if he pulls Eddie Hall, I mean, why do they need to wait three years for a match? No, no, no, no, no. He needs to start like us. Start in the beginning with some guys. Yes, yes, I agree, I agree. And not to put immediately with some strong guy and to...
SPEAKER_01: to burn him immediately. Yeah. Guys, yes, we are planning to do the sweatshirts and we plan to do the hoodies, everything, you know, soon. Soon they will be available. And again, the t-shirts are available. And I'm sharing the link here. Yeah, right here. Anyway, so, yeah, and we have, did you see the Korean Hulk?
SPEAKER_01: guy from korea the big arm switch arms you know yeah yeah super big i i don't uh show him competed the video they will share the video from years ago from probably arnold classic i think he was pulling with michael i think if it is the same guy and michael had some trouble with him but i i don't know if if it is him or not
SPEAKER_01: uh if that is the guy and if he's right now even stronger and then it may not be easy for alan it may be hard for him yeah alden is strong really and
SPEAKER_00: I think Alden is a favorite for the experience, for the stylistically. He never met a Korean hooker. For sure he's strong because I remember now when he pulled with Larry Weiss, he held him very well in the hook.
SPEAKER_01: It's interesting to see. Yeah, I agree. We will see how everything will be. Do you expect some changes in the world rankings? Like one year later, who will be the right and left arm super heavyweight number one?
SPEAKER_01: Italy for sure, right? Oh, Lamparelli. Lamparelli. Yeah, super heavyweight champion. Lamparelli, he did a very good job, but it was too much later. Yeah, he took the risk, but Dave also has this one. He even pressed La Lessing. He also gave you some hard time too with the, you know,
SPEAKER_00: Strong, right? Yeah, super strong. But I think Lamparelli is another category. Yeah, of course. 115 kilos. I think I offer him a match either with Tatachins or Dave Chaffee. I think he chooses Dave Chaffee. Maybe if you want to try yourself to push your limits, you can do it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, generally Dave Chaffee is 125 kilos. With two dutchings it would be a very, very beautiful fight. Who? With two dutchings. Oh, two dutchings and yeah, he would probably... Yeah, yeah, this is amazing. Long match, it would be a very long match. I think Lamparedi has a very big possibility to win.
SPEAKER_00: because for the leader for the technique for the hand they can turn a very good they reached off to that but i think it's 50 50. yeah so next we have a super chat and then i will ask you the rest wake up at engine and air mass would you guys be willing to train brian show at least once
SPEAKER_01: so you can teach him and feel his potential. This would be good for YouTube views and subscriptions. Win-win for both. Of course, like Brian Shaw is a very famous guy and him to be interested to armwrestling is a very good thing for our community and our sport. Yeah, yeah. I already wrote to him. You wrote to him? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he would be good. Yeah, if I have the possibility to be in the USA to train with him, for sure I will do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He would be good. Yeah. Anyways, yeah, yeah, we would do that. Wake up. So when I say wake up, this is his name. There are another super chat hanging before. Okay. What does he say? Hermes, can we buy the top role?
SPEAKER_01: Ah, no, no, no. No, I don't have. I don't have. Oh, how did I pass it? I don't know. Sorry. Chalk on walks. Another one. Hermes, can we buy top release for smart people t-shirt? I had some t-shirt, but it's very difficult to say. What does this guy say? Matteo Bernasconi. Why Vecchio Sbrega Brian?
SPEAKER_00: What does that mean? Okay. What does it mean? Okay. So right arm, Hermes Casparini will be on his crown and sitting with his belt, you know, and listen, if you, if you win two more matches,
SPEAKER_01: Two more world title matches, then you will have the belt permanently. You will take it home. You won already one match against Jerry and then you lost against Devon. You need to win the belt two times, two matches. Because I won with Jerry. And that's all. And then you lost against Devon. I need to beat Levan and win another time.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes, yeah. If we beat Lewa, nobody will beat me. Impossible. Okay, impossible. Nothing is possible. Yeah, impossible. Okay, anyway, so your right arm, next year, September, Hermes is sitting on his crown, and who is at his left side for the left arm? Laletin or Morozov?
SPEAKER_00: I think La Letty. But you saw that Morozov is getting... But La Letty is more strong with right or left? I think right. But I think La Letty, stylistically, is very bad for Morozov. I think stylistically, only someone who has
SPEAKER_01: Like, this has chances. Rising, pronation, back pressure. Or someone like Jerry. After this, impossible to beat Dalet. But listen, what do you think about Jerry versus Vitalii? That's very dangerous. Like, Vitalii, Vitalii, flash pin him, pin him. He couldn't pin him, especially at the center of the matchup. Finish. Bye-bye.
SPEAKER_00: Bye-bye. I think Jerry has a very good chance to beat him. But I think someone like Chaffee with Jerry, I think Chaffee, he can beat Jerry if he pulls the hook. Who? Dave Chaffee? Dave Chaffee was doing that in the past right now. His arm is just moving. That's why I come in.
SPEAKER_01: That's how Kamil beat him like this. So I think that only the people, Hermes, who can use this. Do you see the bottom side here? Here. And then very fast to the side way, isolating Jerry's pronator. That's how you won. And very fast. Very fast. But Jerry says that he was very ill. And he says that he's going to kick your ass.
SPEAKER_00: You're going to say, no, impossible. Impossible. No, no, I really, really, I told, I said many times when I was with Jerry, I think I was in the best shape, not for the match, not about the match, what I felt in this period.
SPEAKER_00: But I was very super mega prepared for this fight, really. I felt super good shape, everything, mentally. I remember when I was on the stage,
SPEAKER_01: Nile called me on the stage, I felt super adrenaline, you know when you feel very super good moment, power. Yeah, but this is how everyone feels when the opponent is very sick and ill, and then you say, oh yeah, I'm going to kick his ass. No, no, before the match, I mean before the match. This is why I'm saying that, because you knew that he was ill.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
SPEAKER_01: in any way you would win, you know. But there will be a time that you guys will pull again. Every time you guys are talking and I'm trying to promote the match, like, I so much miss competing, you know. Like, I also want to compete, Ermes. I started training, and what happened is that I was beating Artur 2-0, and then even in the round that I beat him, Thor bicep.
SPEAKER_01: then i get rest and then like not rest but heal that i didn't have surgery i made a mistake it still doesn't look good and then like i started to do some training a little bit with raimon's i pulled remember one month training i went to dubai and then and then i was getting ready for samusha and i hit my head like this
SPEAKER_01: But for Samushia, really, like a friend, I think it was enough time to pull with him. I mean, listen, every time I see him, he's getting stronger, stronger. Like, if you asked me one year ago if possible, I would say if I'm very good, it's possible. Right now, I mean, even Sasho couldn't beat him. Like, you...
SPEAKER_01: over-pronate, whenever you over-pronate, you make him mad. Doesn't matter. Yeah, this is very bad because you are, and the guy is just hitting you like this. So the way to beat him is just like you need to control his... On the hook. Not really hook. On the hook, but yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. You need to control his pronator. Like you really need to have full cup of like turning the pronator, make his palm up.
SPEAKER_01: And if he cannot do this, if his wrist is flat, and if he turns here, but this is not that easy. How many kilos he is? What's that? How many kilos he is? He's around like normally near 90 kilos and he's going down to 85. Now he will have another match, title match and rematch.
SPEAKER_01: I think you saw the list, but I'm not going to announce it. The closest fight was with the Kazakh guy. Very good. Aydar Khan. Aydar Khan.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Aydarhan is also very strong. Aydarhan this year lost, but he was on the fouls. He kind of was winning. Yeah, yeah. I hate this moment. Yeah, yeah. And we will see. I offer a match to Aydarhan and he decided to rest. He said that he wants to rest. He just competed Waffles. Yeah, I saw. Yeah, yeah. He wants to rest. And so there will be
SPEAKER_01: match a title match normally uh samusha was gonna rest as well but right now samusha uh will have the match he said again i want the rest he said this in july after the match finished evening later night we talked he said i want to rest and then whenever he found out that from july to november there's four months he said and then probably a week ago five days ago
SPEAKER_01: We talked and he said, I can pull and right now he will be in the November card as well. Good, good. Maybe Alexander he can beat him. Alexander? You don't call it him? Alexander, schoolboy. Alexander. Alexander.
SPEAKER_01: Travis Bajan. Travis Bajan is too heavy. No, no, I know Alexander. He competed many times. I know, I know. I'm acting like I don't know. Maybe him. Listen, listen. When Vladimir Maiorov, when they pulled last time, Vladimir was, how to say, he was, last time I saw him competing was 2018, Moldova event.
SPEAKER_01: And he won there. In the category, he was first place. Second was Bojidar. Third was Flamand Dimitrov. Fourth was Irakli Zirakashvili. Fifth was Vladislav Krasovski from Latvia. So Maiorov beat them like this. And then he stopped training for like four years. And then four years later, he just competed in the Swiss Open. And then...
SPEAKER_01: I offered him a match, and he said, Engin, I'm not training for the last five years. And he trained like two months, and then he still gave some trouble to Samushia. It was not easy, especially there. I could beat him once. And whenever I saw him last time, Vladimir, against Adam Wozniacki, he was strong. Yeah, super strong. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know what would happen if they pull. And then someone like Zoloev like this? No. What's that? Zoloev. Zoloev what? He can't pull with Samushia. Zoloev is in 75 kilo.
SPEAKER_01: And Hacim Razzolev, he recently is not doing super well, but he competed 95 kilo in some other event. He took, I think, second to Tautiev. We will see. I was talking with Ivan Matyushenko yesterday. We had a phone conversation, maybe 20 minutes. And he believes that Tautiev is going to beat Irakli.
SPEAKER_00: For Irakli, his problem is the top roll, guys. But I think leverage, because super long leverage and Dautiti, he needs to go down with the wrist. I think it will be a very close fight.
SPEAKER_01: For the power, I think he has more. Yes, for sure. The guy is just incredibly strong. But if he lost a little bit of his wrist, it would be very big trouble. Yes, it would be interesting. I think the November event, I will just set the matches.
SPEAKER_01: Like tickets we are buying, everything set, everything, everything, everything, and then I will just sit there and watch the match. I will enjoy it. Yeah, it will be incredible. Maybe you do a few matches if you want. You can do commentating with Neil or something. Last time it was not very good because it was the first time. Why not?
SPEAKER_00: Why wasn't it good last time? Why do you think it wasn't good? Because the English is not very good and you need to speak faster. Maybe with Coach Ray I can understand better. Because he's from London and the accent is
SPEAKER_01: Neil is in the chat. Neil, why are you doing this? See? Hermes is complaining about you. I'm joking, joking. Yeah, Neil is my friend for like good 30 years. Yeah, good 30 years, yeah. We have competed many, many, many, many World Championships together. And...
SPEAKER_01: People who join the community, they don't know who is who and this and that. We know who are the people who just recently entered the community and acting like they are some kind of shit or something. I look at them and I laugh, just like those people.
SPEAKER_01: Because they're just like troublemakers, you know, just like every day coming out with a different drama, you know. And then you have people like Neil, that is world champion and a great trainer. Did you know that Neil was doing a lot of
SPEAKER_01: arm wars for the euro sports in the past you know right yeah yeah yeah like like euro sport i don't know how it is now but in the past it was very big tv channel for the sports and and uh neil's uh arm wars was part of the euro sport events and yeah it was like neil was like our window
SPEAKER_00: to the outside of the arm wrestling. He's doing a super job. Good job, really. Everybody who can support the sport is doing a good job. Yes, for sure. You will never see people
SPEAKER_01: having negative opinion like like like john devon and this this like we all know each other and we all know how much we serve to the sport you you can find this kind of people from the the the new people that has not done anything and just try to open a youtube channel and just like trying to yeah yeah yeah no no really really yeah very amazing community yes yes yes anyway so
SPEAKER_01: So that is probably all. And we have been together for more than one hour. Wow. Wow. Anyway, so, Hermes, it's always great to see you, my friend. Me too, my friend. I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, let's get your tickets and then see you here. It will be very good. 100% we come.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's good. Really, I want to come and see all the guys. You miss them, huh? Yeah, a bit, yes. When I see the competition, I feel, you know, burning inside to want to compete with me too. Every time I do East vs West, I see that some athletes who usually compete East vs West, but this time not there. They go and share
SPEAKER_00: training videos, you do the same thing, you know? Because you get motivated, right? Because the competition, mind competition is too high. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you miss to be part of it, right? You miss to be part of it. Yeah, yeah, too much. And imagine, last time you were still... But you feel when you are in competition, yeah, you feel stress, you feel...
SPEAKER_01: know pressing yourself but uh really some some super big emotion yeah yeah and imagine you were there last time was april and now the next is uh november so almost seven months six and a half months you are not part of these competitions you won't be competing but at least you want to
SPEAKER_01: like feel that the atmosphere and you want to breathe in you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Really, really. Yeah. Yeah. And I have a question like, uh, do you think that when you get old, you know, someday you quit arm wrestling, you will miss miss these days. Too much. I will cry every day to see myself to compete. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I kind of feel the same way. Those are all good, good memories, you know, very good memories.
SPEAKER_00: And can you imagine that in the last three years, we write history all together about these kind of things. It's better not to think this because I really feel pain. You get emotional or what? No, no. But really, if we quit, really for me,
SPEAKER_00: But I don't know, maybe after 20, 30 years, maybe he's enough. Of course he's enough, of course he's enough. You see John, he said many times, I want to quit, I want to quit, I have pain, but he's still here. Do you realize that this guy always does something and then again people get crazy?
SPEAKER_01: You remember the way when he beat Corey West? It was like very late in the morning, you know. Yeah, and then you and I, we start writing to each other. And then this time again, you know, like what happened in Orlando. Like, if you just wanted to remember Orlando events, 17 super matches. The first thing comes to your mind is John match, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And this guy again just made...
SPEAKER_01: whole crowd, even the whole community get out and they were like, wow, you know, because he always does something. Incredible. Incredible, right? Yeah. Yeah. Anyways. So, Hermes, anything you want to say? Thank you very much, my friends. Thank you too. Thank you for the guys support me and see you in Istanbul.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, see you in Istanbul, my friend. Take care. Stay healthy. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.
