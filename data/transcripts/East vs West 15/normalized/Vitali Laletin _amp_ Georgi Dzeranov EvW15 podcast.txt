SPEAKER_02: opportunity that he wants hello everyone how are you my friends hello hello let me turn the sound on more can you hear your sound is low i don't know if it is because of
SPEAKER_02: My phone or something is wrong with yours? Your microphone? Everything is as usual. I hardly hear you. You do not hear me? I hear you but like very low volume. Very low volume. I don't know how the people on the chat hears. Do you guys hear Ivan loud enough?
SPEAKER_02: One, two, three. Low volume. But let me see what people say on the... Okay, they hear you well, so I don't know. I don't know if my sound is... Okay, maybe something is wrong with my phone. Can you talk again? Sorry? Can you talk again, I said, but yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Everyone says that your volume is fine. So there must be something with my phone. I wonder what is wrong. Hello, Vitalii. We have a small problem.
SPEAKER_04: Vanya, are you a translator? Well, it turns out, yes. You have to learn English, it seems to me that you already know it well. Let's talk to the maximum in English. And if there is something, then I will already try. Artem has already spoken.
SPEAKER_03: Have you heard? Well, Artyom lives like me. Well, he speaks normally. He understands almost everything and explains something like that. I greet everyone. I greet you. Your beard is beautiful. Georgii, your beard, your face protects us, we can't see you. Only the beard is visible.
SPEAKER_04: Where is Engin? Engin? Where are you? It seems to me that Engin made me an administrator and left himself. A normal year. If anything, about the fees, are they also for you? Listen, there will be problems with this. Is this the case in Moscow? Yes.
SPEAKER_04: I think he's not with us right now. Maybe we should go now? No, he still has to come here. Because I have something to say there, that now I am the administrator. And I am now the organizer. I don't have time.
SPEAKER_00: I said he had a problem and left the conference. So, I'll go try to talk to him in another chat. And this one, where will the live broadcast go? Well, in theory, here. In theory, on this one, on YouTube, yes, it will be broadcast, or how is it? Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_03: I would like to find him. Why do you need him? Do you want to watch him on TV? Yes, I want. Maybe without Engin. Let's do it. There will be no English language at all. Today... I'm not on anything except Russian. You just don't understand Kazakh, right?
SPEAKER_00: Who do I understand? Percentage? 10-15. Such. Communicating. Bring it, take it, give it. Sugar, water, bread. And when they speak slowly, when they start speaking quickly. Just the majority of Kazakhs understand Russian well, so it helps, right?
SPEAKER_00: Almost everyone. And young people too? Yes. In the northern regions, 100%. Even young people. Where I live, in big, big cities, almost 100%. It's somewhere in such villages, we call them aulas. It can also be in the depths.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. I think I came back. Hello, hello, hello, guys. Yeah. Can you guys turn your phones sideways? Okay. Let's start.
SPEAKER_02: So, how are you, Vitalii? Good? I'm good, very good. Good. You will beat this guy, this Geronimo? No problem. No problem, right? How are you, Georgii? Good? I'm fine. Yeah, good.
SPEAKER_02: Good, good. Alhamdulillah, huh? Yeah. Alhamdulillah. Yeah. So, and you, Ivan, how is the preparation? Good, thank you. You look strong. I see the videos. Rather, rather good. But so you are satisfied with your preparation? I'm never satisfied.
SPEAKER_04: Never satisfied, but is it less? But now I'm more satisfied than it was before, so it is good. So your shape is better right now? I'm not sure, but my elbow doesn't hurt so much, so that is what is nice. Okay, I understand. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Let's start from there already. Vitalii said that for this, I don't know, it's no problem. It's going to be easy. What does Georgii think? Georgii, what do you think? Vitalii doesn't see the problem in winning you. Do you see any problems on the way to success?
SPEAKER_04: I can't say for sure, but I know I'll try to deliver problems to Vitalii. So he can see them. That's what I'm doing. Georgii says that he's not sure, but he'll do his best to make problems for Vitalii. He'll make everything to make him see, find problems.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. He will make everything to make it interesting for him. So if it is interesting, does it mean that once it is interesting, it means that Dzeranov will win that match? Because interesting means a tough match.
SPEAKER_00: Does it mean that if the match is interesting, you will win it? Maybe. Maybe it will be. I would still like to show such armwrestling. Not in one touch from me, and even more so from him, but to have a fight, so that we really left satisfied and everyone was
SPEAKER_04: He would like to show real arm wrestling. He doesn't want to have any flash pins, both by him or Vitalii. So he wants to make a good show. Okay, this is what I am saying. Once it is a good show, who has higher chance?
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that if it's an equal fight, if there will be a
SPEAKER_02: I would, but he will have more chances. Because he thinks his endurance is better? I think so. He didn't say that, but I think he meant that. This is what he meant, okay. And Vitalii, what do you think about all this? Vitalii, what can you say?
SPEAKER_03: I wanted to show a very good, beautiful fight, because the last time I was with Artem, my subscribers scolded me that I did everything too quickly. And we have one more question for Artem. How would you fight yourself in a slow fight? Although I will say that in some fights, Artem punched me in the wrist, twisted me, I twisted him.
SPEAKER_04: Vitalii says that he wants to have a good fight too, because after his match against Morozov, his followers blamed him for those flash pins. So now he wants a more spectacular fight. So even if he can win easily, does it mean that he's going to make it a tough match?
SPEAKER_03: So that his fans will not blame him? So, if you can win in Kasań, you won't do it? I can win in Kasań, and then behind the scenes... For the sake of the subscribers. For the sake of the subscribers. Will you continue the fight? No. Only for Georgii, if... Only for...
SPEAKER_02: What do you think, is it dangerous to play with Georgii?
SPEAKER_03: The thing is how much Georgii is ready. Everything depends on Georgii. If he is not equal in strength, then it is dangerous. If I am stronger on the head, then it is safe. Again, we don't know this. Therefore, it is better to be careful.
SPEAKER_04: He thinks it depends on Georgii's form right now. If Vitalii is head above him, then he could possibly play some games. But he doesn't know that. So he will not risk that. What does Laletin think about Georgii's chance against him?
SPEAKER_04: What do you think, what are your thoughts on Georgii's chances? If you look at Georgii's fight with Rivas, Georgii was easier with him than I was. Vitalii compared Georgii's fight with Rivas and he thinks that Georgii looked better against Rivas.
SPEAKER_02: He thinks that Gheorghe is dangerous. Is he more or less confident compared to before the Morozov match?
SPEAKER_04: He had more confidence against Morozov. So he thinks that this is a more dangerous match for him? Obviously.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. So that's what I try to understand how he sees because before the Morozov match, he didn't really take him so seriously and whatever the score was, it proved him to be right. But he is not as comfortable this time. That's what I understand. Yeah. And you, Gyorgy, my friend, where do you see yourself? Where do you see yourself? Like, do you think that, do you think that
SPEAKER_02: you feel yourself like anytime soon you may target the title the belt world champion belt uh sorry i just slept a little yeah yeah i'm just saying that himself you know like
SPEAKER_02: Like, like his level, where does he, does he feel like he is very close to a world title shot? You know, he obviously is coming to beat Laletin. Yeah. And I mean, he cannot be sure, but I don't think he's coming to lose, but does he feel himself like almost getting ready for the title? How do you think, Georgii, how close are you now to
SPEAKER_04: to the level of the title fight, to the very top level. He says that in any case, you are now getting ready to win, but in general, how do you see your level now? Among the very tops, right? How close do you think it is to the level of the belt fight?
SPEAKER_00: It turns out that your fight, as far as I understand, he is the winner, then he will fight with Levan, if I'm not mistaken. Roughly speaking, through the fight, as far as I know. Yes. Well, here, you see, it depends more on the style of the fight.
SPEAKER_00: I know that no one will go to my strong side, so, for example, if, well, let's say, he wins, even, let's say, for example, let's suppose, hypothetically, I won, we go out to the winner, there are Kadareti and Levan.
SPEAKER_00: For me, Kadareti, I think, will be more convenient. Because he will go to his flop, I will not give him, passivate the hand, and he will fall to me in the hook. Theoretically, in my opinion. Even despite the fact that he won Levan, let's say. And, for example, Levan, which, well, too, suppose, it's hard to suppose,
SPEAKER_00: Well, he lost to Kadareti, but at the same time he can beat me. So it depends on the opponent. In general, yes, now I don't think I'm at the peak, but since it will be 3-4 months, for example, I will rest for a month, prepare for 3, then the chances will be good. I won't say that 50 to 50 or more or less, but
SPEAKER_04: It will be possible to fight. Georgii says that many things depend on the opponent's style. For example, he thinks that Jerry is rather comfortable with him and Levan is not. And if Jerry somehow wins Levan,
SPEAKER_04: So it depends on the opponent. And he thinks that he is strong, but he thinks that if he wins this fight, that in 3-4 months he would be able to give a fight to anyone.
SPEAKER_02: So he believes that if he is good enough to beat Laletin, then he will probably be ready in the soon future for the title match?
SPEAKER_04: He just said that now he doesn't think that he's 100%, but in four months he would be closer to that and that would be enough for him to give a fight for anyone. Yeah, yeah, that's what I am saying. If he wins this match, we are not going to give him a match a month later, you know, so he will need some time. But it means that he will prove himself that for the next match with a good preparation, he will be ready. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Vitalii, how do you think Dzeranov can beat you? What is the possibility? Do you think he can hook you? Or do you think he can beat you with the deadlifts? Or he can toproll you? What do you think is the possibility? Do you understand, Vitalii? How can Dzeranov beat you?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, I understand. If it was a training, I would try with Gyula to the hook, and up, and to the side. But since this is a competition, I will try to fight only with the top, because I can. For me, the fight in the hook is a dangerous fight. Vitalii, I'm sorry, I have a question.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So that Georgii will not be able to top roll him, that he needs to be too tired for Georgii to have any chances. So the only way he thinks is hook, but
SPEAKER_02: or not too many chances as well. Okay. Georgii, do you think that he's playing games, he's afraid to be top row, he feels comfortable for you to try hook, and probably he's playing mind games with you? Because whenever we see LaLatine losing someone, we see him with top row, not in hook. Can you ask him if LaLatine is doing tricks?
SPEAKER_04: Engin asks, do you think Vitalii is sincere now, or is he... Engin says, we didn't see Vitalii screwing someone in, and if he lost, then it's over. So, the question is, what do you think?
SPEAKER_00: Is Vitalii right to say that you have a chance only in the hook? Is he trying to confuse me? Well, you know, I wouldn't want to reveal all the cards and say how I'm going to fight. I've already said it, I've already said it.
SPEAKER_00: No, well, Vitalii, in your case, it is clear, you are a very strong, but very linear fighter. Yes, you can fight in the hook, yes, you can fight in the side, but I will say the same with all respect, well, in the hooks against me, you have, well, you understand, few chances, so, of course, you will not try it. Well,
SPEAKER_00: We'll see. I'll try. I'll try, maybe, to set Vitalii up. Maybe something will work out. I'll give you a tour. I'll try to orient myself. Maybe, maybe. I'll change the technique during the capture. I haven't held Vitalii's hand, roughly speaking, at the table for eight years.
SPEAKER_00: That's why I can't answer this question right now. And what he says sincerely or not, maybe sincerely, maybe not. He is my old friend in Italy. But you have to give him what he deserves. Despite the fact that he is a linear fighter, he is very technical. And he fights smartly, quickly. Therefore,
SPEAKER_04: In other things, I think he's not stupid either. Far away. Thank you. So, Gironov says that on the one hand, he doesn't want to say now what he will do. He will reveal his plans. Maybe he will follow Vitalii's advice and hook him a little, maybe not.
SPEAKER_04: Also, he says that he didn't pull Vitalii for eight years and he doesn't know for sure himself now that he will make decisions when he takes the grip. Unlike Vitalii, he has many weapons, not only a chopper.
SPEAKER_04: uh here uh he's not sure about playing games maybe yes maybe no okay oh but uh definitely he says that italy is very smart uh in terms of technique and both uh and in all yeah yeah so yeah guys are you guys sure that like
SPEAKER_02: the chat that even doesn't have the microphone problem because I see hear your voice some loud and some low. I don't know. Yeah. Anyway, so so he basically doesn't always saying that he doesn't really care if Laletin is playing game or not. He's gonna follow his own game plan. This is what I understand. Yeah, yes. Yeah. Okay. And
SPEAKER_02: yeah i think they are they are saying that sometimes you get yeah cutting you know your audio yeah anyways okay let's uh talk about the the cart and i ask this to anyone we tell you how do you see the card level of the matches uh did you like the card
SPEAKER_03: According to the fans, 75% of them said it is the best card so far. He agrees with those guys.
SPEAKER_02: So he says it's the best card, he thinks? Yes. And Dzeranov? He says he considers it to be the best. He what? He considers this card to be the best so far. He considers, okay, yeah. Your microphone is really like,
SPEAKER_02: I hear you. One moment. Like high and in the same sentence, low, high, low. Yeah. Okay. Anyways, so let's talk about the matches. Vitalii, which one is your favorite match? In the cards. The most interesting for you.
SPEAKER_02: Right now, I heard everything very loud, Ivan. I brought the mobile closer to me. Oh, okay. Closer to me. Okay, sorry about it, but like for us to hear clear. Vitalii, which one is your favorite match? Vitalii, are you here? Yes. Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_02: This will be the most interesting match for Ivan Matyushenko. Let's start from there, Vitalii. How do you expect this match to go? The majority of people think that Alizhan is slightly favored. Do you agree with that?
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that those
SPEAKER_04: People think so because I didn't lose for many years. But if I do not sleep and be fast, then I will have chances. But how many chances? I will win. He says that he will win. Okay. So he says that if you are quick enough, you will win the match. Okay. Yes. Okay. I think he just supports me.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, ask him if that is the reason. Yes, he supports me also. No, no, but is this why he thinks that you will win? Yes, I think so.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, he still thinks that I have good chances. But not because he supports you. He really believes that you have good chances. Okay, that's what I want to hear. And you, Georgii, Alizhan, from Kazakhstan, and Ivan from Russia, like same as you versus Vitalii? Well, it's clear, yes. I support and support Alizhan. He's my friend, brother.
SPEAKER_00: And we trained together for a very long time, despite the fact that Ivan Ivan Matyushenko is my, well, I can't say that I'm an idol or that I'm a fan, but at least the most respected, one of the most beloved athletes, if not the most. I considered him for a long time.
SPEAKER_00: At least before I beat him, that he was in the third, roughly speaking, to the left, in the three, in the world, in the world, in the absolute weight category. But I want to be a little objective, even if so. Yes, I actually believe that Alizhan has an advantage, but
SPEAKER_00: not so defeated as many say about it that there is one gate in touch I think there will be a fight there will be a fight so serious I think that there will also not be and even I think that they are a little faster and more technical Olezhan, in my opinion, as if more physical strength a little bit and
SPEAKER_00: And as for endurance, I can't even say right now, because I haven't seen any long fights from Alizhan since he... I haven't seen any long fights at all. And since he gained weight, even more so. Ivan also doesn't like to fight for a long time, but at least his endurance is not bad.
SPEAKER_04: Let's say, not at the highest level, but not bad. I think with a small advantage, Alizhan will take this fight. Georgii says that first of all he supports Alizhan, he is his friend. Can you come closer, Ivan? First, Georgii said that Alizhan is his friend and teammate and he supports him.
SPEAKER_04: So, and then he also thinks that he is a slight favorite, Alizhan. He thinks that he has a little more overall strength, maybe power. But also he thinks that I have an advantage in speed. Maybe I'm more technical.
SPEAKER_04: In terms of endurance, he's not sure who is better, because he also didn't see Alizhan pull any long matches. He thinks that I have endurance. Maybe not very good, but still I have endurance. He doesn't think it will be four flash pins. He thinks it will be... Tough match.
SPEAKER_02: a tough match and I will take some rounds also. But all in all, he sees Olezhan as the best. Let's go to another one. Azat from Armenia versus Danil Ustinov from Kazakhstan. Let's start with Dzeranov.
SPEAKER_00: I watched very little of Azat's performances. What's his name? He's from Armenia. I watched very little of him. I know he was a champion.
SPEAKER_00: Again, of course, many may think that I am sick, well, that he is my compatriot from Kazakhstan, Ustinov, and because of this I am sick. But it just seems to me that he is physically more powerful. He has bigger hands, he is young, he breaks into the fight, he is very motivated. It still seems that he will win.
SPEAKER_00: First, he said that he didn't follow much the effort from Oniani. Yeah. But on the other hand,
SPEAKER_04: Unfortunately, I don't watch a lot of sports.
SPEAKER_03: I train all the time. And the guys who are starting to fight again at the events where I perform, I don't know them well, of course. But if I saw them in person, I could tell them apart. Vitalii, can you estimate their strength?
SPEAKER_03: So, there's no opening? No. Okay. Okay, Vitalii. Brigitta from Hungary versus Gladkaya. Well, Gladkaya, she hasn't fought for a long time. She's very... She's very excited for the win. She wants to win. I think she prepared well for the competition. I think there will be a victory before her. She's in very good shape.
SPEAKER_02: Does she think she can beat Fia Ryzik for the world title match?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I think so. So he thinks that Gladkaya will become number one. She will become the world champion in East versus West. Okay. Yeah. And you, Georgii, do you know Brigitta from Hungary and Gladkaya from Russia? I haven't watched or watched women's armwrestling for a long time. Naturally.
SPEAKER_00: I know Irina Glotka. I saw her performance before. But, as Vitalii said, she hasn't performed for a long time. And I don't know her opponent at all. Therefore, there are no assumptions. I suppose that Glotka, due to the fact that she is more famous and that I know her. But it will be very subjective.
SPEAKER_04: Georgii says he doesn't follow much women armwrestling now. But he used to see some women armwrestling in Vlach. And he saw Gladkaya. And that's why he thinks that she will win. And he doesn't know her opponent. He thinks she will win because she has many more titles.
SPEAKER_02: He's much more experienced. And I think it's true. Okay, yeah. And we tell you, Artur Makarov versus Ömer Farukh Kozakoğlu. Do you know Ömer Farukh Kozakoğlu? Do you know Ömer Farukh Kozakoğlu? Do you know Ömer Farukh Kozakoğlu? Do you know Ömer Farukh Kozakoğlu? Do you know Ömer Farukh Kozakoğlu? Do you know Ömer Farukh Kozakoğlu?
SPEAKER_04: he doesn't know he doesn't know okay and and do you know this i don't know
SPEAKER_00: His hand is like the famous Oleg Dzok, the Turkish guy. Yes, I understand. I haven't watched his fights, but I know that he won, although many people say that it was very contradictory with our Aydar Khan. Yes, he won on fouls. He lost, but won on fouls. Yes, he won on fouls.
SPEAKER_00: He fought with them. I didn't see this match, but I just heard it. But it already speaks of the level that he fought with such a famous armwrestler. I think, I just assume, again, of course, I can't say that
SPEAKER_00: I support Artur Makarov, although I talked to him, and yes, I know him, and I can still say that I support him more, because he is more familiar to me, a good guy, he impresses. I think 50-50, or maybe even his opponent will have a little more chances.
SPEAKER_00: due to the fact that he is very hungry for victories and, how to say, perhaps more motivated. But this is, again, a very superficial opinion that does not reflect the whole essence. I didn't really follow them. Of course, I've known Artur for a long time. After Georgii Serdachev and
SPEAKER_04: I didn't follow much that Turkish guy. He knows that he pulled Ederhan and he is sure that he has really high level and just
SPEAKER_04: He's not sure at all, but he thinks that maybe this guy has some more chances because he's also young, motivated and more hungry for victory. But he's not sure at all because he didn't see many matches, many of his matches. Let's talk about Samushia versus Maiorov Vitalii, the revenge match.
SPEAKER_03: He thinks Samushia has more chances. He has bad endurance. He will hold somewhere.
SPEAKER_00: somewhere in defensive position and it would be a great spectacular match but he thinks that samush is the favorite and georgie yeah
SPEAKER_00: He thinks it will be an even fight.
SPEAKER_04: The score could be 4-3 or something like that. Both efforts will have advantages. Not advantages, but... They have their own weapons. Yeah. It will be a very intensive card match. But he also thinks that Samushia has...
SPEAKER_02: But endurance, and that's why he is the favorite. Okay, so both guys say that it's a very close match, but Samoche has better endurance, so that's why he has more chance to win. Okay. Yeah. Okay, let's go to Betkili Oniani, Oleg Dzok. Vitalii. I haven't seen Dzok for a long time. I don't know his form.
SPEAKER_04: He didn't see Zhuh for a long time. He's not sure about his form and he will support Oniani. He supports Oniani? Yes. And Georgii?
SPEAKER_00: I will also be rooting for Oniani, although I don't know him at all. And I think he will also have an advantage. Yorkie also said that he supports Oniani. And he also thinks that he will win. Okay. That Oniani will win. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And now Vitalii, Irakli Zirakashvili vs Georgii Tautiev. It will be a very interesting fight. Irakli has already won for himself. But Georgii Tautiev has gained a lot of weight and he is getting stronger every day.
SPEAKER_04: This match is very interesting for Vitalii. He thinks that Irakli already won this match in his mind.
SPEAKER_04: But he should not underestimate Georgii. As Georgii is getting bigger and better, he is getting to his peak. And Vitalii wants to support Georgii and he thinks that Georgii will give him a very good fight. Okay, very good fight means that it will be a tough match. Okay, I understand.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry? Your camera is off now. Yeah. Okay. And, Georgii, Georgii Tautiev versus Irakli Zirakashvili. Yes, Irakli Zirakashvili seems to be stronger physically. Because no matter who he fights behind the scenes, he wins everyone. I don't even know who can beat him.
SPEAKER_00: But it still seems to me that Giorgio Tautiev has very good chances. I definitely support Giorgio. It's just a long arm. He fights with the top, a strong wrist. For Irakli, such fighters were a problem.
SPEAKER_04: Georgii says that he supports Georgii. He thinks it will be a really good fight 50-50. Irakli seems to be more powerful. He beats everyone.
SPEAKER_04: was it called uh after after uh after pulling yes yes yes but he thinks that uh georgie is really uncomfortable so it's 50 50. okay he thinks it's 50 50. how about right now the 60 kilo woman world title match
SPEAKER_02: Dimitrina Petrova versus Carolina Pettersson. So he doesn't follow. So they don't know about this much. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: But I think it's really great. Yeah, yeah, I believe the same. I used to say the same, that women arm wrestling is not so interesting, but now I changed. You changed your mind, now it's interesting, okay. Well, it was, yes, interesting somehow, sometimes, but I didn't follow it. Now it's really exciting.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes, yes. Okay, let's go to Yoshinobu Kanai versus Tata Shins, Vitalii. Kanai and Todd Hutchings. Yoshinobu Kanai is a Japanese from 2000. He won against Michael Todd. He will definitely win. That's 100%. Who will win? Todd Hutchings will win. Todd Hutchings will win 100%.
SPEAKER_02: 100%. And you? Todd Hutchings. Todd Hutchings? Todd Hutchings. Okay. And... Okay, then... Let's go to another big match. Genadi Kvikvinia vs. Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_02: I'm curious about this. This is the match that for me is the most interesting. No disrespect to anyone. Because I think that it will be a war. So what are their opinions? Michael Todd and Genadi Kikvinov. Genadi, after the injury, as we all know, has recovered. He may not be at the peak of his career.
SPEAKER_04: He managed Genadi's injuries. We all know that he was recovering for many months. But last time, Vitalii managed to pull Genadi
SPEAKER_04: somewhere after the event and he found him really good. So he thinks that he has good chances and he will support him. Okay. Georgii? I really like the Kinsmov wrestling technique. I really like it. And Genadi Kvikvinia is very impressive.
SPEAKER_00: He can be won, but his character can't be broken. Charismatic, strong, explosive, versatile, resilient. And I really want him to win. But we see how Monster is gaining. I don't know in what form Genadi is.
SPEAKER_00: If he, of course, gets to his peak, then he will win. And if not, then I think the Monster Todd will have a small advantage. Georgii said that he always liked Genadi for his character, for his personality, how he pulled.
SPEAKER_04: uh in terms of technique also he's um he had a great endurance uh really strong uh and he wants uh him uh gennady is one of his uh favorite pause and he wants him to win but he is not sure uh how good is he after injuries and on the other hand he knows that monster is becoming
SPEAKER_04: Better and better. Now he lost the great. So he's not sure who will win. But if Genadi is healthy now and 100% ready, he thinks he will have good chances. Okay. So he says that Genadi will lose the match only if he's not ready. If he's ready, he's going to win. That's what he says. If Genadi is ready, 100%, if he's healthy, do you think he'll win?
SPEAKER_02: Yes. Correct? Yes, correct. So if he is in his best form now, he will win? Yes. Yes. So I think that way. Okay. Okay. So Oguzhan Koçak versus Nugoshikadze, Vitalii. Do you remember Oguzhan Koçak? Do you remember?
SPEAKER_04: He doesn't remember Ozan? He remembers his name but he...
SPEAKER_02: You know Ozan is like 2019 World Champion. He beat Jordan Sonev in the final. Same year at the Europeans he beat Sacho Andreu. At the Zloty Artur he won 2017-86, he beat Clement Dimitrov there. Ozan and him also, I remember them, they pull after pull, you know, after I think WAF or Europeans or something at the side table.
SPEAKER_02: Agurjan against whom? Vitalii, they pulled at the side. I remember after the party or something, they pulled somewhere. Vitalii, the Turkish guy, do you remember he also pulled, I think he lost 3-2 to the super heavyweights. What was the guy's name? Vladimir Makarov organized an event? Yes, I also tried to remember.
SPEAKER_02: I think the guy also beat Ferit in like a few AMC events earlier. Yeah, I forgot his name. So he doesn't remember Ozan.
SPEAKER_02: You don't remember, do you, Vitalii? I don't remember, Vanya. Honestly, I don't remember. Just remember the face. Okay. Do you remember, Georgii? I remember this athlete. Georgii, when you won 110 kilos in Romania, Vaf, Oguzhan won 100 kilos. I remember. I remember this athlete very well. Very strong hooker. Hook with a triceps.
SPEAKER_02: I remember that Vladimir Akpirov came to Oguzhan's home and made some videos. But they also had a supermatch in Vladimir's event against Grigory Lyashuk.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, is there anything about Nugo or Ozan? If I had been in the ring and performed regularly, I would have put Nugo. He was very strong at the time, but now I don't even know, I haven't seen him for a long time.
SPEAKER_00: I think Nuga would win just because
SPEAKER_04: He didn't see Oguzhan pulling for many years, and he is not sure about his form. But if you asked him in those years when he was the world champion, then he would say Oguzhan is the favorite. Okay, so he thinks that he has been away from the sport for a long time, and he is not sure about his form, and he doesn't think that he can come back that quick, and that's why Nugo is favorite.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, Rino Maslich versus Ibragim Sagov, Vitalii. Interesting fight. It's a similar, one-type fight. I think Sagov will win. Sagov is in very good shape now. Sagov wants to win. I think he will win. Really instant match.
SPEAKER_04: rather similar, but he thinks Sagov would win. I cannot hear you, Ivan. Say again. He thinks that both Irina and Ibragim have similar styles, but Sagov is more motivated and strong now. So he says he thinks that Sagov is the favorite. But also he sees it as an interesting matchup. Interesting matchup, yeah. And you, Georgii?
SPEAKER_00: uh he thinks that uh
SPEAKER_04: Both of the athletes have good shoulder pressure. But Rinne is more versatile. He also has top roll. He can hook. So he will certainly make problems to Ibragim. But he still thinks that Ibragim is the favorite and he would win. And he supports him. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And I think the only match left is Devon versus Petrenko. You start, Vitalii. It's going to be a very interesting match. But since Petrenko is gaining a lot of weight now, and Devon is losing weight and becoming weaker, I think there will be a win for Petrenko in this match.
SPEAKER_04: He sees Petrenko as the winner as Djavan is cutting weight and Petrenko is getting stronger and stronger in his weight. So he thinks Petrenko is the favorite. Oh, he thinks Petrenko is the favorite. That's interesting, surprising. And Georgii? I think that...
SPEAKER_00: Petrenko, yes, he can win, he has a lot of physical strength, rough. Naturally, endurance and technique on the side of Devon, experience and so on. The only question is how psychologically Devon will be able to create a problem for Oleg before the fight and at the exhibition.
SPEAKER_00: if he succeeds in full, as he succeeded before, if Petrenko, let's say, succumbs to his emotions, then, to my regret, Devon will win. And if Devon wants a pure fight, namely a power one,
SPEAKER_00: he thinks that um
SPEAKER_04: Petrenko has more raw power, he has stronger effort, but Devon is more experienced, trickier, he is more technical. And if Devon manages to play his games before the fight, if he manages to use some of his
SPEAKER_04: tricks, so to say. And Petrenko would follow his games. Then Georgii sees Devon as the winner. But if Devon will pull without all that, all his weapons, just arm wrestling, then he sees Petrenko as the winner.
SPEAKER_04: So he thinks that Petrenko is the stronger guy. Okay, so you think that Petrenko would win, but maybe before the goal Devon may do some things and he can win? Yes, and also speaking about endurance. Petrenko has worse endurance, so if Devon manages to... Stop him? Stop him somewhere, yes. And my question, I will ask two more questions and finish.
SPEAKER_00: How do you see your chance against Devon if you pull super heavyweight? What do you think Sam could do without Devon? Super heavyweight? Super heavyweight? I don't know. Maybe I would be uncomfortable for him. But he has a strong hand. He would try to break it.
SPEAKER_00: I would work a little bit on the side pressure, on the triceps. And maybe, maybe I would have good chances. But again, it depends on how balanced I would be.
SPEAKER_00: emotionally, I would have approached this, that is, if I were cold-blooded and, let's say, did not pay attention to his falls, or so with irony, then I would have put it on myself if I still could not master myself and would have started to play according to the rules of Devon, then most likely
SPEAKER_04: He thinks the psychological factor is most important. If Devon manages to play his mind games before the armfight, like he played with Hermes,
SPEAKER_04: uh he would bet on uh if if georgie follows his games uh if he didn't manage to not to pay attention to them so but uh on the other hand uh you think that um
SPEAKER_04: He also, in terms of technique and strength, he has chances. He would work on his triceps, on his side pressure, and he thinks he could be a very uncomfortable opponent for Devon also. But the main factor is psychological. And you, Vitalii, would you beat Devon? 3-0. 3-0? Yeah. Easy or hard?
SPEAKER_02: I agree. I think Vitalii will be uncomfortable for Devon. What? Georgii agrees. He thinks Vitalii will be very uncomfortable for Devon. Okay, okay. Someday this match needs to happen. And the other question I want to ask is that were you guys surprised by the result of Alex Kurdecha versus Jerry Cadoret match?
SPEAKER_03: What do you think about the fight? I was very surprised at how easily Alex lost. I actually thought that Alex would be able to show a beautiful fight, at least not win, but resist very much. And after that, I was very interested in the fight between Alex Kurdes and Artem Morozov, to see how they would fight.
SPEAKER_04: But unfortunately, the fight didn't take place. I'm really looking forward to it. Vitalii was very surprised to see Kadarit pull in. One second. Can you repeat again? I cannot hear. Sorry. Vitalii was surprised to see Kadarit flash-peering. That's Kurdesha.
SPEAKER_04: would give him a very difficult match.
SPEAKER_04: was not sure that kurdiche would win but he thought it would be a long long match equal match yes so he was very surprised and after that he was also very interested in kurdiche's match against morozov uh to see his level but he's still waiting for it but does vitality think that jerry can be a big danger for him as well
SPEAKER_04: What do you think, is it dangerous for you, Jerry? Yes, every opponent is dangerous in his own way. But I think I wouldn't lose to Alex so easily if I lost to him. You wouldn't lose to him, right? Yes. You just said you wouldn't lose to him as easily as Alex, but you wouldn't lose to him at all, right?
SPEAKER_04: He said that he would not lose to Fedoret as Kurdeyche lost, not so quickly. If he lost, but he would not lose, he would win. Okay, if he loses, it would be a hard match, but he believes that he would win? Yes. Okay, but after he pulled against Kamil, he said that he's not used to against this style.
SPEAKER_04: Does he think that he may experience something like that? Like a Kamil match? After the fight with Kamil, you said that you didn't have much experience in fighting such opponents. Do you think that this kind of fight can't happen with Kadareta? Kadareta doesn't fight as brazenly as Kamil. And Kadareta has a more pleasant fight. He has a hand from the shoulder.
SPEAKER_02: And Kamil, he just covered him. And he just pushed him with his shoulder. I think that Jerry is not as tricky as Kamil. Okay, Jerry is not as tricky as Kamil. Okay. And you, Georgii, were you surprised when Alex lost against Jerry? No, not at all. I completely guessed the outcome of this match. I didn't imagine it from the very beginning.
SPEAKER_00: What can be opposed to Alex Kurdech, Jerry Cadareti? And when everyone said that it would be an easy walk for Alex, I was just in amazement. And how? Well, it was clear that Alex has a weak side pressure. He is very strong, he has anthropometric data, like Vitalii, but technically speaking,
SPEAKER_00: Georgii was not surprised at all. He thought beforehand that Alex had no chance as a troll.
SPEAKER_04: And he was very surprised when people said that Kordesha would easily win. He thinks that Kordesha lacks side pressure a lot and that he is not very good technically. He obviously became better and stronger, but not that good. Okay. The last question.
SPEAKER_03: How many chances does Jerry have against Levan? There are chances. There are always chances. I think it's an interesting fight. No one has ever fought against Levan like this. As Hermes Gasparin showed in the fight against Levan, Levan has a bad hand.
SPEAKER_04: That's why Jerry has a big chance. I think so. You definitely won't be big there, right, Goris? Yes, well. How much? 30 to 70. 30% Jerry, right? Yes. 30%? Yes.
SPEAKER_04: After Hermes, we see that Levan can have some problems with such pools. So, he would give, how he said, many chances to Jerry and many chances are 30%. Many chances? He said that he gives many chances to Jerry and those many chances are 30%, yes. Okay, okay. And you, Georgii?
SPEAKER_00: Jerry versus Levan? I think Jerry has a lot of chances too. 10-20%, but that's a lot too. I think even 10-20% is a good chance against a fighter like Levan. And Jerry can get stuck with them. If Levan wants to play with him. He can't win from the start.
SPEAKER_04: jorge also gives many chances through uh jerry uh he says 10 to 20 percent he would give and he thinks uh 10 10 to 20. uh yes uh and he thinks that against such a great uh opponent uh these chances are also uh yes and if uh
SPEAKER_02: Plays with Jerry, he would certainly have problems. Okay, so he shouldn't make any mistake. Yes. Okay. Okay. Anyway, so thank you very much. Okay, somebody is asking, they are asking, what is your chance in percentage against Levan Laletin?
SPEAKER_04: He didn't think about it yet. He would tell you, tell everyone when we talk later before his match against Levan.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, not yet. Because whenever I asked him if he has a dream to become number one, and he said he lives for that dream that day, he said he lives for that day. So that's why I asked him, you know, just if he wouldn't pull right now against Gisela, if he was pulling against Levan, would he be ready right now? Or he still needs some time?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, his dream is not to win Levan, but to become the best of the best.
SPEAKER_04: He thinks he would need half a year of preparation. Just for specifically to get ready for Levan, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Anyway, so I think Dijarano already said about his chances against Levan. So we don't need to talk. Thank you very much. Thank you, Vitalii. And thank you, Ivan. Thank you, Yogi. You're welcome. And I see you guys in about two and a half weeks in Istanbul. Yes, see you. Thank you. Take care. Take care, guys. Take care.
