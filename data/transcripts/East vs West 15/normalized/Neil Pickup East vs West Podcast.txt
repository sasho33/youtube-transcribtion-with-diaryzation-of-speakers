SPEAKER_01: yeah soon neil is gonna join and we are going to yeah he came already hello hello hello neil hey mate how are you doing great great and you i'm okay i'm tired but i'm okay okay
SPEAKER_04: so let me let me turn the sound off here okay so how is everything my friend it's all right mate it's okay i'm um i'm just back from giants live at a giants live event this weekend so um forgive me if the voice is a little ropey
SPEAKER_04: I blew it to pieces, as usual, at the weekend. We had a packed house at the Utility Arena in Birmingham. So we had about 7,000 or 8,000 people packed into there. Good event. It was the World Strongman Open. We had Iron Bibby breaking the World Log Press record with 231 kilos. Michael Hooper was his usual ridiculous self.
SPEAKER_04: so yeah it was uh it was good fun mate good event good event but yeah and then after that least versus west card which i was looking through today after you sent it me mate that is ridiculous that might be my favorite card i will tell you something like whenever i look at from outside i think it's my favorite card as well it's a bloody good card mate
SPEAKER_04: It's a pretty good card. Very, very good, guys. And I'm very... I mean, we're going to get into the matches and so on today, but one of my favourite arm wrestlers, as you know, is making his debut here, and I can't wait for that, and that's Torchieff. No, Torchieff. I'm a massive fan of Torchieff, mate. I think he's lethally dangerous, so I'm really looking forward to it. Who did you say? Torchieff.
SPEAKER_04: I think he's unbelievable. So that's going to be very interesting for me. There's a number of matches on there which we'll go into. Bet Killy. Dude's a killer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's focus on the King of the Table. It is upcoming. It is less than three weeks, 19 days only left.
SPEAKER_04: I'm a little bit gutted because the date change meant that I couldn't go, which is sickening. It is what it is. Originally, it was planned for the 21st and now it's the 28th, so I'll be in Vegas at Giants Live Vegas, so I have to miss this one, which is a shame. Nothing I can't handle, but it's a sickener because there's some great matches there. Yeah. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_00: let's talk let's talk about the upcoming events yeah and there are there are a few matches do you know i don't still know i haven't i don't remember if i met him in person but catchback from aspect i think from poland i think yeah he's gonna he's gonna pull against nidal in cristo yeah i i mean
SPEAKER_04: I don't know enough about either of these guys in terms of their specific level right now to comment on that, to be honest. Yeah, I feel like anything, I always like if I'm going to give an opinion on something, I always like, it was the same with when Ray pulled against Ryan over in Florida. I know Ray very well, but I didn't know Ryan's level very well. And I always feel like if I'm going to give an opinion on something, it should be,
SPEAKER_00: based on some kind of solid or authoritative uh belief or guide open season for me here mate i'm learning a little bit here yeah yeah the same same for me i know nadaline very well and other guys are very good kashfa is i think also very good um i apologize if i pronounce his name wrong um
SPEAKER_00: But, yeah, about the Ryan versus Ray, I had very quick wrist move and very good endurance. Yes. So I would just say that he and Rymus are at the same level if they would be the same weight. Yes. But when the guy is about 10 kilos heavier, so I kind of was guessing that he would be the favorite, yeah, at that time, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Anyway, so you don't know much about these guys, so let's go to the next one. Orton versus Korean Hulk. Okay, I'm going to go with Orton. I'm going to go with Orton, and I'll tell you why. What is the reason? The reason is because I believe that the Korean Hulk's wrist is vulnerable.
SPEAKER_04: Have you ever seen his match against Michael Thompson at the Arnold Classic? Yes, yes. But I believe... It was the day that Michael beat Dimitrina Trubin. Yeah, all of the above I know. But I believe that the Korean Hulk's wrist is vulnerable. I think if he gets top-rolled significantly, then he's going to have problems. All the...
SPEAKER_04: comments that I've heard from a lot of people, from various people, is that Orton has levelled up tremendously. Arm strength, I believe the Korean Hulk's significantly stronger. Significantly stronger. But I believe that his wrist is suspect and I believe that Orton can do something with the hand and wrist. If the Korean Hulk is smart, if he drops the match,
SPEAKER_04: Gets the strap. Can find a really solid anchor point. He's very much in the match. I mean, I think it... I believe that his arm strength will be... I don't want to go into these percentages. I don't do that. Because it's always a guess. But I think he's got a measure of strength benefit overall. I think he's significantly stronger. But I think he's not got a big hand.
SPEAKER_04: not got a particularly dominant hand and wrist from anything I've seen from him in the past. And I think if, I know what my game would, my game plan would be if I was Odom, a hundred percent. I think it would be nailed on how I would address that much. I'm not going to go into it because I don't think it's fair to do that in case anybody takes reads from it. But what I would, there's a very, very clear path if you're Odom Larratt here. I really do believe that it's one that he will have been
SPEAKER_04: drilled into him, he'll have been versed on big time. And I expect that's what he'll do. And I think that can give him the victory. We'll see. I think most people will believe, most people will probably believe that Orton starts as an underdog here. I don't know. Has there been any sort of, any specific polling done or anything like that? Have you put anything out there? No. No.
SPEAKER_00: But the only thing I know that Ardun is, in my opinion, a better arm wrestler, more technical, more well-rounded, smarter, but not stronger. Maybe stronger in some ways.
SPEAKER_00: some parts that like maybe like about coordination of the muscle groups but i think physically the other guy is stronger i i i think that the other guy needs to go to strap 100 and then in the strap then then if he can dominate he wins if he cannot dominate yeah he may even guess out because
SPEAKER_00: These guys are more like powerlifter type of guys. They have incredible explosiveness. But the endurance, just think about Alden is almost every day probably training and hours and hours and pulling. So if the match stops somewhere, I mean, then Alden will have more chance. But the other guy really needs to dominate. If he dominates, Alden may be the one
SPEAKER_04: who is exhausted because of trying to stop something that is like too strong. Yeah, it could go past the elastic limit. But the way you described the match a moment ago is actually how I see it in my mind. I think Korean Hulk is dangerous early, may get the first round, may even get the first two rounds. But I think it makes for a dramatic match because I do believe he gasses. I do believe he'll be doing it with a compromised wrist.
SPEAKER_04: I think Orton gets his hand and wrist at some point. That's what I believe. And I think when he does get his hand and wrist, he's got enough versatility. He's got enough aggression. He's a very aggressive armourer. And I believe he's got enough endurance to outlast him. And I think that I wouldn't be surprised if this ends in a 3-2 to Orton.
SPEAKER_04: I have to take in some difficulty early on. Korean Hulk is a... I mean, if he doesn't go for straps, he needs his head reading. I would immediately go for straps. I wouldn't even think about trying to hang on to Orton. I imagine Orton is very much aware of that. Okay, there is another person who is close to you, same as Alden. Alden is...
SPEAKER_00: your very close friend's son. And now you have very close friends. Yes. Rob Vision Jr. pulling against Nugo Chikadze. Yeah. And how do you see this match? I love it, mate. I think it's great because, number one, I'm going to say, let's start with Nugo.
SPEAKER_04: So, Chikadze and his match at East versus West, I don't think a lot of people were overly familiar with him. When he came out, we were saying in the broadcast booth, if you're not familiar with this guy, hang on to your hats. Sorry, I just got a friend. The sound is gone. Podcast brother, can I call you back?
SPEAKER_04: Cheers, mate. Sorry about that. Yeah, we were saying that he's a pocket rocket. Guys, you know, he's fire through bushes. And I think a lot of people really enjoy the New Gold match. I think he's a very entertaining arm wrestler, very endearing arm wrestler. He ignites the crowd. You could hear even the Georgii team.
SPEAKER_04: was so you know ignited by the way the guy arm wrestles you can't not love this dude i think he's great and i actually think rob will love him i think rob and nugo get on um i think there's a clear um differential here in where the strength lies nugo on the inside i believe may have a strength advantage he's certainly got a leverage advantage
SPEAKER_04: But I believe he's giving away... Okay, okay, one second, one second. Who has the leverage advantage? Nugo. In the hook, I believe, has a leverage advantage. Nugo is not a hook puller. I know, but I think he's going to end up going there. I believe that if it goes top role, I think that he will be losing the match. My honest opinion.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, you think? Why would he lose the match? Why would he lose the match? Because I think that Rob's hand and wrist is his biggest weapon. Many people don't. I do. Rob talks himself. So you are saying that Nugo cannot top-roll Rob? With a strap, maybe. Yeah, this is what I was saying. With a strap, maybe. But I believe that Rob, outside of the strap, before the strap is applied, can beat him.
SPEAKER_04: in the hand and wrist i think his hand and wrist is dominant and i think it'll prove that way if i was robbed my game plan would be to try and not let the thing go to the the straps you remember when he pulled in the uh i think i can't remember it might be the northern region um one of the reasons he pulled against um toddzilla blasted the hand and then straight down on top just punched down i would be looking for something like that if i was robbed
SPEAKER_04: And I don't mind saying that live on here, because if you can get that... So you are basically saying that without the strap, if we can keep the game without the strap, Robbie is going to win this. If it goes to the strap, then the advantage goes to the Nugo side? I think that if the match goes to the strap, the start is critically important. I don't think that this is an easy match for either man.
SPEAKER_04: I say this every time I speak about Rob Bidgett. If Rob Bidgett shows up, the best of Rob Bidgett shows up, I believe Rob Bidgett wins. The best of Rob Bidgett shows up. Rob is a very, very... If Rob Bidgett loses, it means that Rob lost because he wasn't at his best. You will not give credit to Nugo? No. No, you'll see how the match runs. There'll be enough signs. I won't be there to read them, but there's always enough signs that Rob Bidgett Jr. matches.
SPEAKER_04: You'll be able to see beforehand. Everybody in the room will be able to see beforehand. It won't be just when they get to the arm wrestling table. Rob is an incredibly easy read prior to matches. I would like to think in this match that Rob can show his best. I think it's a very, very interesting match and a very difficult match. I think we've just seen just how good Nugo is from what he did with Margaret and how close he ran.
SPEAKER_04: margarine margarine many people don't really know or appreciate how good that that guy is personally um i think that 99 of people watching will have will have nugo as a favorite if i'm honest i don't believe that many people will feel
SPEAKER_04: Maybe some diehards in North America or RBGA fans to the core may believe that he's the guy. But I think a lot of people will actually think Nugo's going to win. Can I ask you something? Sure. The John that you saw in Orlando and Rob Widgeon, who wins? I think Rob. Rob Widgeon? I believe so. It doesn't matter what the result of this match, right?
SPEAKER_04: no no okay okay i don't i think a lot's asked of john brazing i think a lot gets asked of john brazing john is john now is so far past proving john's results now for me or immaterial really i just i couldn't really i couldn't really care who beats him how it goes to me it doesn't make a scrap of difference my
SPEAKER_00: knowledge of and experience of john is sort of um set in stone i know what i've witnessed i know what the guy's done through his career yeah there is no doubt i don't i don't think anyone has any doubt about that one i think you do i mean if anyone who has doubt it means that he is either new or he doesn't care or something like that you know just like yeah i mean just just bring 2006. i mean it wouldn't be close
SPEAKER_04: Just wouldn't be close. But John now, yeah, we've seen enough evidence of where John is right now and John's commitment is right now. John's doing what John should do. He's just enjoying himself and arm wrestling because he enjoys it. Neil, John is doing his best at this age. If this guy is coming to Orlando, 112 kilos, the guy is doing his best. And if he is fighting from this position,
SPEAKER_00: and bringing that match to the win, not giving up. So the guy is doing as much as he can right now. And he said he wants to pull in the December US event. Awesome. I love that. Who doesn't love watching John Paul? I mean, non-armwrestling fans maybe. I don't care who he armwrestles.
SPEAKER_04: I really don't care. I don't care who we are, muscles. As I say, results don't matter to me with John. I don't really care if he pulls, if it's a competitive. I wouldn't be putting, for me, I wouldn't be putting John into matches where it's an elite slayer. I really wouldn't. No, no, no. John, there are so many matches out there
SPEAKER_04: proving matches where people will have the opportunity to pull John and also I like those matches more in some respects. I love the match with Leonidas because Leonidas is still on that learning curve and you have the opportunity to see John go through the range and the spectrum of what he is capable of from terrible positions in that match and it was so dramatic and so entertaining. I think John versus Rob would be a very, very good match.
SPEAKER_00: very very good match yeah anyways um so let's go to the next one kamil versus cory um i i have my own like we know that kamil is very very strong but like just think that when kamil pull against uh la lesson this is what i said also i say this every every program but
SPEAKER_00: Like, what makes Laletin is incredible is his hand power and his low hand top roll that he doesn't allow anyone to go inside. You understand? But when you pull against Kamil, Kamil doesn't care if you took his wrist, you understand? So what I'm just saying that, yes, he gave hell to Laletin in that match. If he was more careful, maybe he could have won.
SPEAKER_00: Uh, but what I'm just saying that is there any possibility Corey to have more arm, you know, then, then, then not as him because coming is not gonna hook Corey either. So what I'm just saying that all he needs to do to have fast side move, you understand for Corey to move that way. So what would make us think that he may not win this one? Like.
SPEAKER_00: I see on the paper Kamil is a favourite. If I would be someone who is betting, I would bet on Kamil. I don't bet because it's against my belief. But what I'm just saying, if he does everything right, you think that Corey doesn't have a chance? Corey's definitely got a chance. Okay, so that's what I wanted to know. Definitely got a chance. Without a shadow of a doubt, yes. Who do you think wins?
SPEAKER_00: I'm telling you, Kamil is on the paper, is the favorite. But if I say that there is no way, then it's not true. Yeah. Corey has a chance. Big chance. Yeah. Yeah. Very, very good chance. Big guy. And do you realize that Corey in Orlando, like he always looks big, but this time he looked big, but more active. Better condition. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he was in a good place mentally. I think he was...
SPEAKER_04: You know, he was in a good place. He was very relaxed. He was... I mean, we didn't get to see a lot from him, did we? Let's be honest, because it was comfortable. It was right within his wheelhouse. He's going to be tested a great deal more here. But what he does underline is both these guys are definitely in that real upper echelon. They are right there in the top, you know, solidly in the top 10. I'd like to just think out where I'd actually put them. But as you said earlier, I do think on another day,
SPEAKER_04: that Camille can come out with a win against Vitalii. It didn't work for him that day. Vitalii got the win and deserved it. But it shows where Camille is at. Camille is very, very dangerous. The style is very difficult to combat. I will tell you something. If Camille knew what he learned after the match with Vitalii, before the match,
SPEAKER_00: And there's the possibility that Kamil would beat him. Like, do you realise that he lost, like, last round or something? Like, I mean, by fouls, two fouls. Like, we tell him last year, two fouls. And then every round after that, he won, you know? Yeah. I actually said that on the night, on the broadcast. I felt like, you know, you toss the coin another day, it lands very differently. On that night, Kamil was very unlucky not to get the win.
SPEAKER_04: very unbelievable but yeah it was very close man very close match i think i think the reality of arm wrestling the reality of probably any elite sport you can say this about there are there's nuance within the match there's stories behind the story and you often see that i mean let's be honest vitalia latin i think was unbelievably unfortunate not to beat dave chafee
SPEAKER_04: On reflection, I'm glad that the first time they met when it was the incredible match, if you look back at that, there is a real argument that it was already done and dusted. On reflection, you wouldn't change a thing because it turned into the most supremely entertaining, amazing match. It was great, you know, but could have already been over by that point.
SPEAKER_04: But for referees seeing it one way, it was a judge to have tried to push Dave off the back of the pad. Personally, I don't think he did. I think he was going for the pin and he got it. That's my honest opinion. There's nothing personal in that. I just genuinely believe he won the match. But he didn't get the result. We've all been there. We've all been there. So...
SPEAKER_04: For me, everybody takes their, you know, you pay your money, you take your chance. On that night, it didn't work out for Camille. But it didn't really detract from Camille at all or from what I felt about Camille. It just underlined how dangerous the lad is. He's very, very dangerous. Very, very good. And he's getting better. Who's winning? Corey winning or Camille winning?
SPEAKER_04: I would give a very slight edge because of style and because of speed to Camille. I think Camille probably...
SPEAKER_04: 60-40, 55-45, somewhere around there in terms of how I see it. The main thing being there, the main thing being speed. I think the initiation, the willingness of Corey to meet him in the centre of the table because that's Corey's style as well. He's very powerful, very, very strong. He's very strong and he's very powerful. I'm not saying the lad's slow. He isn't slow.
SPEAKER_04: But I think where his strengths are, Kamil will feel pretty comfortable. And we'll be able to engage. And he's extremely quick. Really powerful initiation with the press for Kamil. And that gives me the feeling that he's a slight favourite in the match. Okay. Let's go to the next one. Serhii Kalinchenko versus Georgii Svetkov. Wow. Wow.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, two men. Did you see the recent shape of Kalinchenko? Did you see? I do. Yeah, I'm very aware of that. And it's that awareness that makes me hesitate for a moment. Because if you'd have asked me this 18 months ago, I don't believe it was close. I think Georgii would win with ease. I do have Georgii as the favourite here.
SPEAKER_04: Because of the fact that, in my opinion, where Kalinichenko is at his very best, he's in a top role.
SPEAKER_04: where he's at his most comfortable, he's in a top role and where he's at his best. I think that Georgii is vastly underrated in that respect. He's a phenomenal top roller. I'm talking about a fit, firing all cylinders Georgii. And I believe right now that Georgii is very, very big, very, very strong, very, very motivated and very ready. And I think that he is the favourite in the match. I've got him like a 60-40 favourite, maybe slightly more because of the styles.
SPEAKER_04: I love Kalinichenko, incidentally. He's great. Really, really good. Really entertaining. I love that he tries to make a show. I love that he's on the rise. He always makes an effort to bring it to the match. I like the fact that he goes above and beyond the arm wrestling match and he tries to deliver entertainment to the viewer. And I think that's an underrated facet in any arm wrestler's game. And Kalinichenko brings that in spades and I commend him for it. I think this is a brave match for him.
SPEAKER_04: to take. I think that Georgii Svetkov is one of the most underrated arm wrestlers in the game. I really do. And for anybody who's trying to capitalise on the hand and wrist, you're going to have a hard day with Georgii. He's really, really difficult to dominate. Do you think that Georgii to lose against Alex Kurdesha had a lot to do with his ankle? I think that match, put it this way,
SPEAKER_04: I think that match is as yet undetermined. I don't believe that that match has really happened. And I don't think Alex does. I think Alex would like to do it again. I think Georgii would like to do it again. I think the fans would like to see it again. But if you were in Turkey at that time and you saw just how bad Georgii's leg was, it was really bad.
SPEAKER_00: really bad i mean we saw him on the day of the event i asked him a few times i said like yogi like if you don't want to pull don't pull and he said oh i'm okay okay and after the event he said that he wasn't okay and i said like why did you want to pull he said oh i didn't want to fail the event this is what he told me yeah told us the same so you are saying that yogi is like the yesterday artem morozov and ivan matushenko they were my guests and
SPEAKER_00: Morozov thinks that Georgii's side pressure is no good. So, Serhii will try to top-roll. Maybe he loses his wrist, but he will still be able to press Georgii's arm with, like, not totally bent back, but just a little bit, like, you understand? Yeah, I can see that lane. I will be unbelievably impressed if Kalina is able to do that.
SPEAKER_04: Do you think that with the pressure, even if he loses his wrist, if he brings Georgii here, do you think that Kalinchenko can continue like that? A lot will depend on, that's a very generic statement in my mind, because I'd need to see the shape of the match. The nuance in an arm wrestling match is vast, and the position of that is vast.
SPEAKER_04: the timing of when the move takes place, the degree of extension between the shoulder and the wrist. I'd need to see a lot of things. If I'm seeing the match happen, when the match is in play, I would make a read of what I see at the time. To say generically that I think that without...
SPEAKER_04: any kind of risk control so a flat or busted back wrist kalina can pin uh georgie i would be very impressed if he can i don't believe he can i think that will be a difficult ask i think kalina's best chance is to have blasted very very quickly and separated georgie to be able to finish that if he was able to do that if he was able to quickly
SPEAKER_04: gain a very significant advantage in the match yeah maybe you can do that but i don't think that's the case i think uh i think it's going to be i think it's going to be difficult maintaining center and i think georgie will match him in that area very very good in the hand and wrist very difficult to top row very difficult to top row okay so let's go to the next one alex kurdecha versus artem morozov right arm
SPEAKER_04: Confusing? Absolutely amazing match. I go backwards and forwards on who I believe is the favourite. I think a lot of people will judge Alex Kadecha of what happened with Jerry Catarat. I do not. It would be a mistake. Yeah. Jerry Catarat... Totally different opponents, yeah. Exactly.
SPEAKER_04: Anyone out there, and I don't count you amongst them for obvious reasons, but anyone out there who is making that read, who believes that because of what happened with Jerry, that Alex is on the slide, is not so dangerous, is not so strong. I think that you're misreading the situation. I think Alex is unbelievably dangerous. I think in any kind of orthodox arm wrestling shape,
SPEAKER_04: he's still right there. He's extremely powerful. And I believe that this is a much better match. Probably the best match on the card, let's be honest, I think. It's my favourite match on the card, for sure.
SPEAKER_04: because I think it tells more. Most of the others, with the exception of the first match we spoke about, that I can't really comment on and I don't really know. All the others, I do believe I know the outcome of it. I do believe I've got a pretty solid feel on how that match is going to go. For me, Rob and Nugo and this match are the best on the card, in my opinion. I think those two matches are really excellent. And who did you say they were winning?
SPEAKER_04: I've got a very, very slight advantage right now on the right arm to Alex Kadecha, but it is very, very slight. I've gone backwards and forwards on who I thought. I started off and I felt that Kadecha was a pretty solid favourite. I was re-analysing some of the outcomes of matches that I'd seen and you've got to look at someone's total body of work and also where they're very comfortable.
SPEAKER_04: And I believe that Morozov is an extremely versatile puller. I think he's very comfortable in any and every position. And he's a real athlete. Genuine athlete. I think he's got a slight endurance benefit in this scenario. We saw what happened when they met on the other arm. Unbelievable. Unbelievable match. I mean, you're not going to see a better heavyweight match than that. It was amazing. I think we could see something similar.
SPEAKER_04: I wouldn't be surprised. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw another absolute barn burner. Very, very small margin of favouritism for Kadecha just because of the speed in the top role. If it turns into a long, drawn-out battle in the way I just described, then probably a slight favourite to Morozov because of endurance. How have you got it?
SPEAKER_00: Very, very, I don't know. Unknown, yeah. Is my connection good? I can hear you okay. Can you hear me good? Yeah, I can hear you. You went blurry there for a moment, but I can hear you pretty good. Right now it's okay? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, that's good, that's good, yeah. Anyway, so let's... Let's go to Devon versus Leonidas, left arm. Well, I've got these guys on the show tomorrow, as you know. I always pay a lot of interest in matches like this. I think that... Let's break this down by the sort of facts that we know.
SPEAKER_04: Leonidas, in my opinion, is better on the left arm. Okay. He froze up there in a little bit. Just let me know in the comments, guys, whether you can still hear me. I can't see anything, but he's frozen up. Are you back? Could you hear me okay then? Okay. So, I'll just go over what I was saying there, mate. I believe that...
SPEAKER_04: Leonidas is more comfortable and is better pro rata on the left arm. I think generally the level of arm wrestling on the left is slightly lower than the right if you look across the whole set. And I think Leonidas is better on his left arm. I think Devon is far less comfortable on his left arm and is less versatile on his left arm, but he's faster on his left arm.
SPEAKER_04: he does however have exceptional endurance and i believe he's a significant favorite in this match that's my opinion because of the pronation control because of the endurance because of the experience in high level arm wrestling matches i absolutely love the progression of leonidas and i love his fearless nature i love the fact that he'll take on any challenge
SPEAKER_04: I think he poses a threat long term to a lot of people. I'm just not sure it's right now. The fact that Devon has lost so much weight is a big factor here. I feel like Devon is much more dangerous when he's bigger.
SPEAKER_04: But the funny thing is with Devon, you never know how much rope he's letting out in matches. Because one thing I'm very aware of is that he makes matches entertaining. He has fun with matches. He will let out rope to allow an arm wrestler to pull. Particularly when I think he's very fond of that arm wrestler. And I do believe that he has a lot of respect for Leonidas. Now, Leonidas Arcona is on a tear.
SPEAKER_04: He's very, very strong now. Real, genuine strength pedigree. Maybe he's got enough to do something. Maybe I'm dwelling on a little bit of nostalgia because I've seen Devon do some very impressive things with the left arm when he's in good condition. I don't believe he is in the best condition now. And I think that makes this a better match than it would ordinarily be.
SPEAKER_04: I think it's a more interesting match. It isn't my favorite match on the card because of the fact that I feel like Devon has a lot of experience. And I think that comes to any kind of super match format. Devon is a horrible man to arm wrestle. Really horrible. I mean, he's got so many options. And in a similar way to what Leonidas encountered with John,
SPEAKER_04: There are very few men you'll ever arm wrestle as good as John Brzenk. John can contest the match anywhere. He can do things that other arm wrestlers simply can't do. He's brave enough to do things that other arm wrestlers simply are not brave enough to do. John is arguably the bravest arm wrestler of all time, certainly as brave as anyone in terms of where he'll take the match.
SPEAKER_04: Devon is cut from a similar cloth. He will go anywhere. He'll contest the match anywhere if he needs to. And I think that's one thing, whilst John and Devon are very different people, one of the things they do share is that. I think Devon wouldn't risk a match by trying something which didn't work in early rounds in the final round of the match. But John would
SPEAKER_00: I can't disagree. I don't think that's the case. You cannot even show me one proof that you disagree because you just want to stick with your opinion. I think I cannot. You cannot see John beat Arsene Lille two rounds in strap and lost two rounds while trying to hook him without strap. In the fifth round, he still tried to take him
SPEAKER_00: inside without the strip. The same thing he tried with Kociev. Every time he tried to go all that way, he got flushed. But he, in the last round, it was 3-2 and if he would lose, it would be 3-3, tie, finish it. There was no extra round at that time. Well, the ultimate example of that is Farid, isn't it? Oh, Farid. Yeah, he went inside, but you cannot find, if Devon is Devon, he's like, he's
SPEAKER_00: Only knows that the opponent is exhausted or something that he tries to do to him. But first, he always secures the match. Yeah, kind of disagreement. He wouldn't try. I think they both got a fearless edge to them. I think both guys have the balls to try anywhere. I mean, that is like a general statement. When you go into the details, there is no example like this. I think there is. I think I've seen him do it a couple of times.
SPEAKER_00: Just show me. Tell me and I will go and check it. I'll pick out some stuff and we'll have a look at it. But I believe from what I've seen of Devon, I know that Devon will try to win in absolutely any way possible. Absolutely any way possible. I mean, if he's already winning, he can do any style. But if he's losing, he wouldn't risk it. That's what I'm saying. John is not like that. John would lose that match. He would still be stubborn enough to do whatever he wanted to do. What he wanted to do, he's like a computer game, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I remember I had a Corvette when I used to live in the US. There was a curve that it says 15 miles. Every time I come to the town, I was trying 15, 17, 20. I think I came to 35, and then finally, the one side of the car lifted from the ground. You understand? It just reminds me, John, that he doesn't care.
SPEAKER_04: The only thing that this guy wanted to prove today, it was to himself, to no one else. I've never seen him even claiming that he is, I'm the God, I'm the best. You would never even hear from him. Slight distinction. Slight distinction here, mate. John does it sometimes for different reasons to Devon. So John will do it for pure entertainment. Devon will do it because he has to to win.
SPEAKER_00: But when you are under extreme duress in a match, both men have got the opportunity and the bravery to go anywhere, any area. John, no, bravery is because necessity. Yeah, I understand. John doesn't do that because if he knows he's going to win top rope, but he couldn't hook him during the super match, he will just try to hook him and still beat him that way because he wants to. He doesn't do that for entertainment. The guy is not normal.
SPEAKER_00: Like, if there is on this earth, if there is, like, I don't believe in UFOs, you understand? Those aliens, I don't believe them. But if you ask me, Engin, you are almost 50 years old. Did you ever suspect that one guy is, like, maybe not human? That's John. It's not because of how good he is in arm wrestling, but he is just different. The guy is different, you know? Even mentally he's different. He's not doing it for entertainment. He wants to prove himself. Yeah, I think you may have misread what I'm saying. He doesn't, Engin.
SPEAKER_00: He doesn't want to go to bed in the evening and think that you couldn't hook him. He wants to take care of that right there. He sees arm wrestling like something different. I'm telling you, he only arm wrestles two.
SPEAKER_00: for himself. I don't think he's trying to prove anything for anyone. I don't think that Johnny ever wanted to let people think about me this way. No. I can't even call him, not disrespect, but a little bit crack. You understand? The guy is just like, no, no, seriously. I think you just encapsulated it, mate. Right there. Johnny's doing it for him. He's doing it for him. Every time he does that, he does it for his own
SPEAKER_04: so that he knows. The distinction I'm making here is not really about that. They're making the decision for different reasons, but both men have the ability and bravery to take the match anywhere if the situation presents itself. I would be interested to see if Leonidas is strong enough
SPEAKER_04: If Leonidas is complete enough to be able to take the match into that kind of deep water. I think if he is, what makes it difficult is that Devon has a very, very full box of tools and he will use any one of them. That is problematic for a new arm wrestler because he hasn't got the body of work or a body of experience to deal with some of the positions that I feel like Devon can throw on.
SPEAKER_04: We'll see. But I believe that that is a difference maker. That's why I've got Devon as a favourite. The comparison I'm making with John, regardless of the decision-making process to go in there, is that John can go anywhere at any time and he will, for whatever reason. He's brave enough to do anything and he can do everything well. In fact, he can do a lot of things that most people just simply can't do.
SPEAKER_00: and that's where those guys are both there's a lot of arm wrestlers out there who do one thing very well a couple of things very well but they don't have the versatility to go yeah i don't know that that's different that one can pull in any style like any style i don't think there is any style that that one wouldn't pull no it'll go anyway okay there's a super i love a or sorry i can't see any comments devon himself says
SPEAKER_00: the win is first style is second yeah and one guy says he did against wagner in 2019 started playing around and wagner got up in see that probably didn't even understand what we are talking about yeah that's a different thing he knew that he was gonna win so he started playing around this is not what we are talking about he said devon was trying to go inside with aramis before securing the match but it is because he knew he would beat
SPEAKER_04: Hermes inside. And once Hermes hit outside, he also went outside. He didn't commit to hook Hermes and lost. I agree that they do it for different reasons. In fact, the Super Cup, you just read out, pretty much says the difference there. With John, he will seek out the win in a position that he doesn't need to.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly. He will do that. And he will risk the match. He's much more focused on the victory. Yeah, yeah. Should he need the victory? Should he need the win? I would never do what John is doing. I would never. Like, all my entire career, I would never ever... Like, I would do something if I know I'm comfortable. But I would never risk the victory.
SPEAKER_00: just to just to try something new or something you know i i would i would make sure i win three zero in the round for round five okay i would just do something yeah i understand that part but not not not not that like for me the winning is the priority for devon winning is the priority and this is the normal thing to do what john is doing is not a normal thing and that that's why he's the best uh unique unique he's the best yeah quite simply the best john brazing
SPEAKER_00: is the best arm wrestler of all time. Yeah, and this is not because... There are so many reasons, I can tell, but not everyone understands because not everyone understands in the way that you and I, we look at an arm wrestler. Like, even the quality, the transition... Fluidity. Smoothness, yeah. Beautifully smooth. Yeah, I mean... I mean, don't judge him off what you saw with Leonidas, where he's old and damaged and screwed.
SPEAKER_00: That's not, John. No, even that is, you know, to have that match from here, even to have that match from here, you understand, and then bring it a little bit pronator and then finish it with the... He even shows that when he is not physically stronger and put in a terrible position,
SPEAKER_00: He is an armwrestling machine. He will still find. Just show him this much of a hole. He's going to make that hole this big. Just show him. You either need to dominate him or better not show any weakness because the guy is just... I wish there was a possibility to show I wish there was a possibility to show people some of the things that I've seen from John which weren't
SPEAKER_04: on camera which weren't broadcast which were just in the back room on the table after just some of the stuff that i saw from john against super elite competition many many times some of the stuff that you feel from john when you're arm wrestling john john is incredible
SPEAKER_00: I mean, as long as he wants to do, once he really wants to do, he's just, as you said, he's incredible. That's why I said at the beginning, I don't care now, to me, you can't, the legacy of John can't be blemished, in my mind. No, nobody, nobody, just, I mean, listen, listen. People message me and say, oh, John lost, or John did it, and I'm like, oh, mate, you don't. Neil, Neil, Neil, like,
SPEAKER_00: Okay, everyone have opinion and we respect, but there are some people that really knows about arm wrestling and also has been through all those years. You understand? So whenever you talk about John, the people who are known to know arm wrestling very well.
SPEAKER_00: And who has been through all this? There is not even this much of disagreement about John. Only the people who didn't see those years or they don't know about arm wrestling or something. Other than that, just ask Cobra, ask Devon, ask you, ask Giannis. And you cannot even show me one single person who hasn't been a fan of John Brzezinski and reached to the top.
SPEAKER_00: Every elite athlete is a John Brzezinski fan. Yeah, because he's the best of us. Every athlete. Maybe not the new ones. Maybe they may not know. But anyone who has seen John, you understand, during his career and has been an elite armwrestler themselves, they are a fan. Just ask Denis. Ask Alexey Voevoda. Ask Ivan Matyushenko. Absolutely anyone. Ask everyone. Nobody will say...
SPEAKER_04: And that in itself is something, mate, that it is so universal. Go to Russia, go to Kazakhstan, go to Japan, go anywhere you want. Anywhere you want. And ask for the best of the best and they'll tell you he's the best of the best. Have you ever seen anyone who thought he is
SPEAKER_00: the God, but not John. Have you ever seen any, any elite armistice who believes that they are better than John? No. Yeah. No, me neither. No. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. So let's talk about a few more matches before we, uh, finish. We, we announced some of the matches. I don't want to talk about the East versus West. Uh, we have the King of table upcoming, but we just announced a few matches. Like one is.
SPEAKER_00: uh ivan matushenko versus alijan muradov and like i will tell you first my opinion at the 115 kilo this might be the best ever left arm match i think it is i can't think anything any higher quality like the level like this like this is probably one of the most important matches in the history well try and name ones that are close
SPEAKER_00: What's that? Try and name any that are close. Yeah, I mean, for this category, 115 kilo, that's incredible. Bloody hard, isn't it? Yeah, Alizhan Muratov is incredible, and Ivan Matyushenko is incredible. Yeah. And I don't know how you see this match. I would like to know your opinion. Stylistically, I have Alizhan as a slight favourite. And let me sort of explain why.
SPEAKER_04: This will be difficult for people to see unless you've seen where there are some chinks in Ivan Matyushenko's armour. And there are few and far between. The biggest one, the biggest issue for Ivan Matyushenko is mental, not physical. I believe that Ivan Matyushenko will not see himself as a favourite. He never does. He always talks like, you know,
SPEAKER_04: I mean, yeah, we will see. Case in point, King of the Table. We had a bus ride at King of the Table. We were going over to the event. Sorry, I'm getting another call coming in. It's okay, I'm going to answer it. We were on a bus ride to King of the Table. Excuse me. Sorry, persistent call. That's a hang-up. Yeah, just, sorry, that's one of my, I will ring you back when I'm on this podcast. We were on a bus ride, King of the Table.
SPEAKER_04: And they don't come much more self-concerned than Ivan Matyushenko on that bus ride. He was a little solemn. He's such a humble individual. He doesn't give himself the credit and respect that he deserves. Yeah. Zero pride. Yeah. He wouldn't see himself as being a worthy competitor in a match
SPEAKER_04: the magnitude of what you've just described he would not see himself in that role and yet he very much is he is mega case in point look at what happened at king of the table and just how good this guy is he could have won yeah on another day he wins you know brutal brutal arm wrestler the guy's exceptional but stylistically i believe that alijan
SPEAKER_04: The explosivity, the multiple hits, the change of direction mid-match gives him a little bit of an advantage. He's slightly less of a mono direction. He's got a little bit more versatility to the attacks. His confidence, I believe, is through the roof. I don't think Alizhan believes that anyone can beat him. And why should he?
SPEAKER_00: But I believe he's extremely aggressive and I believe it will be 100 miles an hour all gears forward. And for that reason, I've got him as a slight favorite. I think that Ivan probably has the fastest wrist. It's very strong and very fast. While Ali Can is fast with whole body,
SPEAKER_04: And then Ivan has very strong and incredibly dominant hand and wrist over the pronator. Incredible. That is the best of all time. His ability to neutralize the pronator in split second time. And we talked a moment about fluidity and Brzenk's fluidity. In that specific movement, the fluidity from initiation to completion of the movement
SPEAKER_04: is as good as anyone that has ever done it in any technique. Ivan Matyushenko is unbelievably fluid in what he does. He is incredible. It's like the old Bruce Lee statement, you know, where he said, don't fear the guy that practiced 10,000 kicks. Fear the guy that practiced one kick 10,000 times. This is what you're looking at with Ivan. He is incredible.
SPEAKER_04: beautifully smooth at that move. He's incredibly smooth at that move. Very, very efficient. And that makes him super dangerous. For every force, there's an equal and opposite force. And I'm very interested to see whether Ivan Ivan Matyushenko has enough fluidity, enough X-factor in his game to shut down Aljan. Because Muratov right now has looked...
SPEAKER_00: He's looked like he's been in a class of his own up to this point. So I'm interested to see if anyone can do anything with him. If that guy's out there, it's very likely Ivan Ivan Matyushenko. Yeah, and other guys just never wanted to hook Georgii. But when? What round? Anyway, so how do you see the chances? You say you don't like to put percentage?
SPEAKER_04: I always feel like, again, the percentage stuff, you know, I listen to some channels and they talk about this guy's percentage in his prep or where this guy... I can't play that game. In my experience, there are so many factors. But in terms of the match result, in terms of the match result, I do have Alizhan probably 55-45 or 60-40 favourite. I think Alizhan is the favourite player.
SPEAKER_04: Because of knowing that the match is going to go inside and Alizhan may have more horsepower and more endurance. I think also Alizhan's style gives him a good opportunity with Ivan Matyushenko because he won't be exposed in the same way. I don't believe he's running at all. I believe he's confident enough to go straight at and straight through, Ivan.
SPEAKER_04: And I actually feel like Pashchenko is an incredibly intelligent man. And I think he'll be very aware of that. He'll be very aware of the stylistic threat that Alizhan represents. Alizhan is pretty fearless. He will go straight. I think some people feel like they need to be off first and they're a little...
SPEAKER_04: hesitant when they pull matyushenko and that that hesitation is a problem you've got to be able to attack with absolute reckless abandon you got to go straight at the guy and i do believe alijan will do that mate i think he'll go straight out you know you know some guys that they blink eye very little you know yeah blink blink about as much as a baby
SPEAKER_00: I mean, Ali Can is just like those with those like fearless eyes, you know. He's like as real as possible. I and Ivan, we have similar opinion about this match that Ivan's chances to have a much better start and put Ali Can out of position and if he can beat him right away, yes. If not, then exhaust him.
SPEAKER_00: keeping him in a bad position. But I and him, we both also agree that in an equal position match, we think that Ivan will be the one that will be exhausted. I would expect so. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: but that's an incredible match this is just like like you know there are some matches like a level match a level you know there is nothing better than that you understand this is yeah that's one of them and the bet killer is another what's that and the bet killer match is another with oleg's joke holy right now
SPEAKER_00: oh what am i i will tell you something like i love oleg so much and did you know that in the east versus west two or let me bet killy did you know that yeah well let's beat him yeah yeah uh but he was this time i'm not sure if he will be able to stop rolling i i really don't know yeah bet killy right now is really mega yeah that really is one of my favorite arm wrestlers
SPEAKER_04: in the world by some margin i rate that dude i like everything about him i like his attitude i like that sinister edge i like the confidence i like the swagger i think that killie is the balls i absolutely love the dude think he's mega uh gonna take some beating and i actually do believe that that killie is a slight favorite in that match in my mind yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, let's see how it will be. And my favorite match in the cards. For me, I mean, do you know how many world title matches? Eight world title matches. Anyone would think you liked arm wrestling. Eight world title matches. Do you know which one is my favorite? It is a match that number five is pulling.
SPEAKER_00: against someone outside of number 10 as of now it is michael todd versus kennedy quick winning a match and this one oh yeah i forgot that was even on there oh this match listen we have eight world title match and then there are like four or five not world title matches just imagine this is one of them which is not
SPEAKER_04: That match has been a long time coming. It's long overdue. A lot of questions answered here, isn't there? Because obviously both guys have come back from serious injury. Michael Todd right now got a huge amount of self-belief. Yeah. And when you talk about self-belief, I just look at the dictionary.
SPEAKER_04: other day self-belief he was saying yeah well he's proven it hasn't he i mean you know courage under fire
SPEAKER_04: Genadi Kvikvinia is Teflon. He's very, very, very, very, you know, you can't, you can throw stuff at him and he's not going to stick. You can fire as much shit his way. He's just going to, yeah, it doesn't bother him. Nothing seems to bother the guy. His blinkers are on. He's focused on the win. I mean, all the sort of, all the talk prior to the Devon match, nothing sticks. He doesn't care. He's there. You've got to beat this guy. And,
SPEAKER_04: the same can be said for Michael Todd. I think these guys have a great deal in common in some respects and they're pretty irrepressible characters. I love it. I love that match. I love both arm wrestlers. I think it's going to be an incredibly intense match. Yes, yes, yes. The personality. Yeah. The heart. The heart. The spirit. It will be too heavy. Too heavy. Like, just imagine they will be like, you know,
SPEAKER_04: Like, I don't know, like more than V12 engine, you know, just inside of them. They will be breathing fire there, you know. It's going to be a mega match. A long beer like this. Yeah, it's going to be a mega, mega, mega match. I think both guys will come in there genuinely believing they're going to win. Particularly now. You know what's the interesting thing?
SPEAKER_00: Like a bigger game at play right now. And I think Granada will improve a lot. You know what's the most interesting part? There is no way in a fresh match either of them to dominate the other one. That match is going to stop. Yeah, it's going to be a war. That match is going to stop somewhere. And then maybe we will have very enjoyable moments. I bloody hope so.
SPEAKER_04: I hope it delivers on the promise that this match has had. For so many times, you know, we've talked about the match happening. It was supposed to happen back in the WAL when Mike was the champion. It's been coming. It's been coming. Once again, East versus West is bringing the biggest matches in the world. Make no mistake about it, this is one of them. This is an incredibly entertaining match. Like you say, I don't...
SPEAKER_00: don't believe there's any way this doesn't turn into a career-ending death war and i think both guys want that i think both guys are at their best in that kind of scenario you know can you imagine that we're talking about two guys that have huge hearts and talking about two guys that are very well rounded they can pull in very different positions and talking about two guys that have incredible endurance yes
SPEAKER_04: and i think that we will be seeing also a chess game the match will start somewhere and then we will see a serious chess game there well look at the look at the back look at the history of these two arm wrestlers and their record of success in long drawn out affairs both of them love long matches
SPEAKER_04: Both of these guys will feel that when the match stops, oh, yeah, it's on now. Like, this is their wheelhouse. It's where they do their best work. They don't want the match to finish quickly and they don't believe that's where they're at their best. They believe they're at their best when it's a screamer. And I think we're... I will be devastated if this doesn't turn into a battle. I can't see any way it doesn't. I really can't. And it's interesting to see who will outlast the other. You know, you've got Michael Todd, who's, in my opinion...
SPEAKER_04: Probably the best defensive arm wrestler of all time. Yes, yes, yes. Unbelievable defensive puller. Yeah. We gave him that moniker in Arm Wars years ago because I've seen him do stuff. You know, he's like a giant Frodo Hoglund. He'll just never be dead. You know, you can't pin the guy. Neil, just to see this match, if this was the only match, would you pay $20 to watch this match only? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I would pay, too. I would pay only for this match. But we will have, I think, 13 or 14 matches. Oh, there's so much. As I say, even, you know, you've got Irakli and Toti. We're not even bloody talking. We're not even talking about Irakli and Toti. For anybody out there who doesn't know Toti, everybody knows Irakli. Irakli is a killer. He's a superstar. He's getting better and better. You know how people say, oh, this guy improves with every match? He really does.
SPEAKER_04: Irakli does improve every match. He's just getting better and better. Totiyev is an absolute weapon. If you've not seen this guy, if you don't know how good Totiyev is, get ready. This guy is built to top role. He was put on earth to take risks. He's an absolute weapon. And I think this is a great match. Love it. And I love the fact that Totiyev makes his debut and people get to see how dangerous this dude is because he's a killer.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he has many wins against Hacem Razolev. He beat once also Ibragim Sagov, and Ibragim beat him twice in the final, but it was not that easy. The guy is very good, but we will see how the match will be in this 95 kilos.
SPEAKER_04: And you've got other debutantes that I was very impressed with. I believe you've got Hunter coming over against Azat. Yeah, yeah. Let's not talk so many of these matches, but let's talk about this one since it is also public. What do you think? Okay, what do you think about Hunter? I love Hunter. I didn't know Hunter enough, really, until we got out. And he pulled a very good friend of mine. I...
SPEAKER_04: I had a massive amount of respect for the way that Hunter addressed that match. I think a lot of what he did prior to the match was, again, brave. He went balls out. And Doug is no bum. I mean, Doug got hurt in the match. And I think it was the second round. But
SPEAKER_04: That doesn't detract from Hunter at all. I thought Hunter was outstanding. He forced the position. I think he was exciting, entertaining. I think he talks the talk and he walks the walk. I'm a big Hunter and Offs fan. And I'm excited to see how he can do. Azhar, yeah, that's a tough match. Azhar is a beast. So we get a real measuring stick on where Hunter is at.
SPEAKER_00: Hunter is brimming with confidence. I don't think he'll take a backwards step here. He's going to need to be confident because Azat is very, very dangerous. And how do you see this match? I think Azat is a slight favourite. Yeah, I understand. So this is a world title match, so it cannot be an easy match for nobody. Anyway, so let's talk...
SPEAKER_04: A bit about the hot topic. Jerry versus Levan. Hey. King of the table 13. How long have I been saying the guy that beats Levan right now from the current crop, if anyone can beat him? And that's a very big if. Because in my opinion, Levan is...
SPEAKER_04: a separated reality from everyone else right now in orthodox arm wrestling. I really believe that. I believe that if there is a chink in his armor, it would be through some kind of technical X-Factor arm wrestler, which Jerry is one. There are very few. Michael Todd is another one who is an X-Factor puller. He's a weirdo. He doesn't arm wrestle like anyone else. Jerry Catarette is another. There are very few guys that are that X-Factor guy.
SPEAKER_04: I was saying before the Alex Konecha match how dangerous X-Factor arm wrestlers are. A moment ago, we spoke about if you're making judgments on Alex and Alex's level maybe not being where you thought it was. Not the case. It was just he had a very unique experience. Technically different. Very unusual. It can throw you out of your game when you've not pulled anyone like that.
SPEAKER_04: It will be interesting to see. And one other thing, actually, before I go on, I want to throw in here. I've said many times that I believe that people underestimate and underrate how table-smart Devon Saganashvili is. He is, yeah. How intelligent he is. The reads he makes on matches are very, very good. His read of matches is extremely high level.
SPEAKER_04: He's very educated, he's very smart, he's very diligent. And I haven't spoken to Levan, actually. But you see what he is doing? No, I haven't had any contact with him, mate. No, no, no. No, I said you see what he is doing at the table. Yes. And you understand. Yes. And I believe that Levan will be studying Jerry and breaking down... He told me, he told me.
SPEAKER_00: He told me. He said that I cannot do the same exact preparation that I do for everyone. He said that he needs to do special preparation. I'm not telling that Jerry will beat Lewand, but anyone who is saying Jerry is not a danger. That guy doesn't know about arm wrestling. If you make a mistake, if Jerry does apply what he has,
SPEAKER_00: you are in trouble you know yes it's very very very dangerous people they don't understand what kind of feeling you know when when the bottom side of your hand fails like this and then now you are over pronated and then your bicep doesn't really function so much but this is your brachioradialis correct and then you are in a big trouble big trouble and and very unique set of circumstances and not one a lot of um
SPEAKER_04: People whose skill level in the sport is very high do it by repetition movement. You will always try to emulate things that you're going to experience in the sport, things that you're going to see done time and time again. It is extremely hard.
SPEAKER_04: to get close to emulating in fact i'm going to say it's impossible to emulate what you're going to feel from jerry cadaret because he's a unique set of circumstances if you asked alex kadecha right now about that i am absolutely sure that he would attest to that fact he said yeah that's a we that's a weird there are other things there are other factors i haven't spoken to alex and get his read on it but i would imagine that he within himself knows that there are some
SPEAKER_04: strange things going on when you pull Jerry. He's very, very difficult to combat. You've seen how dangerous he is and how hard he is to finish. You only have to look at... A moment ago, we were talking about Genadi Kvikvinia and how good Genadi Kvikvinia is in stopped matches, long matches, matches that are battles. He's incredible there. He lost to Jerry Calvert. And he lost when he was a massive underdog. You know? Sorry, when he was a massive favourite.
SPEAKER_00: yeah jerry was a massive underdog because most people understandably felt that ganadi runs over jerry but the x factor is real john john told me you know we go to the dinner vip dinner okay outside and then i was talking with john i said how do you see he said that if he said if gennady top rolls jerry
SPEAKER_00: He's going to lose. I said, are you serious? He said, you just watch tomorrow. He said, just watch tomorrow. If he goes outside, you will see what will happen. The next day, of course, it was a very close match. But somehow, Genadi was the one who guessed out. X-factor, brother. X-factor. Cadaret, dude, the ginger dread man. Tough guy to pull.
SPEAKER_00: Do you know what I was thinking the other day? Jerry, who is 51 years old, and he beat Alex Kurdeca. John, 60 years old, he beat Leonidas. Tata Ching is 57 years old, I think, he beat Prudnik. Michael, 51 years old, he beat Kamil.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, Devon, 48, 49 years old, he beat Chance. Of course they both weren't in shape, but what I'm just saying that like people who says that like arm wrestling changed a lot. I can only say that as John says that it is more deeper now. There are more people. In the past, you go to WAF, there was three favorite athletes.
SPEAKER_04: Now you go there, there are 10 favorite athletes. In the past, something like East versus West would happen. There would be three very good guys. Now all top 10 is dangerous. That's more prominent in the super heavyweights than anywhere else. Yes, yes, yes. Because... There was like three guys, maximum three guys. You go to the middleweight classes, there's always been a freaking myriad of them. There wasn't the same depth.
SPEAKER_04: in the in the end but the best guy best guy would pull today best guy you understand like like like i'm just thinking arsene lily like just think about the arsene lily of the pool 2007 zloty tour i don't see anyone beating him mate the biggest in my opinion the greatest benefit that east versus western yourself have brought for for the sport of arm wrestling is that sort of neutral ground uh and your level of contact with
SPEAKER_04: all of the pullers, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and the respect across the piece, the ability to pull those matches together is tremendous. And I don't think there's ever been a better time than now if you chart back where the very best guys from across the world continuously facing each other. It's magnificent. And this card's another underlining of it. Jerry and
SPEAKER_04: levan is an intriguing match and it's nice that we're seeing the matches where you think oh the physical level may be close the strength level may be close and then another day you've seen a match where you think okay now we've got a guy we deem as being on any kind of orthodox measure a head stronger but what can this x factor technician do we don't know we'll see
SPEAKER_00: i mean shoot down the game maybe there is a possibility that if that levan tries to go fully outside he may end up his elbow getting out from the back side maybe you understand there is a possibility yeah yeah but if he just dominates if he just dominates the you know center with the wrist control or and then beat him like that
SPEAKER_00: then it's a different thing, you know. It could be over very quick if he gets this, you know. I will tell you something. Before Kurdesha versus Jerry match, people were saying why this match was set. Like people accepted some American patriots. They were saying that Alex is going to beat him, you know. Alex is going to kill him. This is what they were saying. Alex himself was saying this as well. And, but that...
SPEAKER_00: And then before this match, Alex was the person that a lot of people were saying that this is the guy to beat Levan. And then once Jerry won this match, now people still don't accept that Jerry is a dangerous guy. We had him in the presence of greatness. I think you may have probably been on the show. We had him going backwards and forwards. They were betting a car. They were betting cars.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was in their program. I was in their program, yeah. And we were talking about very real terms because of the fact that it is a unique, a unique proposition. You can't, and believe me, Levant Saganashvili is very, very, anyway, I know you know this, but anybody out there who doesn't,
SPEAKER_04: feel like Devon Saganashvili doesn't appreciate the risk represented, the threat represented by Gerry. He probably sees it as being a greater risk than anyone else around because of the fact that this is an unorthodox set of criteria he's going to face with Gerry Canaret. It's somebody you can't plan for.
SPEAKER_04: he does something that you're not going to experience a great deal. I would imagine, going back to what I was saying earlier, that Levan is doing his homework. He's trying to break down the move. He will come in very uniquely and specifically prepared to face what he feels is going to come from Jerry. It'll be interesting to see how effective that is. I expect we're going to see a very motivated, very well-prepared Jerry Cadaret.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Ryan is asking, Ryan Bellinger is asking, do you think Levan would be in trouble in a deep hook? I don't think that Jerry can hook Levan, but if Levan goes there, then it's a different thing, you know. If Levan wants to go there, he can go there. It totally depends, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Like when they go inside, if the match goes to the Levan's winning side, I don't think that Jerry in a defensive hook is that strong. But if somehow Jerry pushed the shoulder behind and a little bit hook and press combination, then yeah, Levan maybe. Because I remember one of the rounds, Neil, Genadi tried to hook Jerry and Jerry pressed him to the table surface.
SPEAKER_04: yeah jerry's i don't think that um the threat represented by jerry comes in any kind of orthodox position or shape i think it's much more that there is a risk to levon trying to get to that shape so it may visually appear like they're in a certain position but what you've got to understand is that the setup and the application of the movements from jerry is very unique very different and if you can get to any kind of a side position
SPEAKER_00: he is he exposes people like no one else very very tough guy to be i have another question for you without talking about his upcoming match yeah it's just only about him i want to talk what did you see in dubai with george that he is a real danger
SPEAKER_04: that he is much bigger and more powerful every time out that he is, um, really on the rise. And I wonder where the ceiling is for many years. Anybody who watches the fix will know that I've been a big fan of, uh,
SPEAKER_04: Before he was in any of the events, before he was in East vs. West, I used to talk about him a lot. If you track back, you'll see that I spoke about him when he was winning the WAFs, that this guy just rolled up there, looks like a giant blacksmith, first time out, he crushes WAF. He's a weirdo. Did you know that he beat Ivan Ivan Matyushenko when they both were 110 kilos? Yes. 242s, they were both 242s at WAF? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: One of the reasons for the statement that I just spoke about was that. Yeah. And do you think that this guy has potential to become the best? Possibly, yes. So he has the potential? Yes, possibly. Okay. It's how big he can get. It's where he goes. It's the level of commitment. I don't know. I don't know. And then do you think that he is... My concern, if you want the honest truth...
SPEAKER_04: I'm not sure he's technically refined enough. But I don't think that Levan will stay around forever. You don't think Levan will be top forever? I don't think he'll choose to. I don't think he'll stay around forever. If you're Levan and you get other opportunities... If he wanted to stay around, just say three more years, he can stay at top, you think? Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And do you think that no one can beat him? Not right now. I think the only guys that can beat him, as you say, you're about to see one of them. It's some kind of... Let me give you an example of what I mean. Say Jerry comes in and he wins. That doesn't mean that Levan can't beat Jerry another day. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. There is an experience factor. If Jerry beats Levan...
SPEAKER_04: Next time they pull, I would say that Levan's chances would be higher than the first one. Unless Jerry just dominates him that way, which is... Definitely. If Alex Kadecha and Jerry pulled again, would it go exactly the same way? Not necessarily, no. You've got to experience these things and you get better. When you experience something, only then do you get...
SPEAKER_04: Only then do you get a real feel for things. Only then do you gain that level of knowledge and experience of how the position felt and does feel. And I honestly feel like the biggest threat to Levan is the unknown and the unique. In any kind of orthodox position, any kind of orthodox arm wrestling, I don't believe there is a man right now that is a genuine threat to him. Do you consider Laletin...
SPEAKER_00: exactly orthodox uh i do but i believe that the latin is the nearest well we've spoken about this many times i believe that the biggest threat represented by the orthodox arm wrestlers with the outside style i think he has the biggest chance by far yeah significantly better than anyone else were you were you surprised when when uh this i don't know hook uh was right at the middle round one um
SPEAKER_00: I'm not saying no, actually. I was very surprised. I didn't think that... He's not a super fast guy, and we know Rivas has incredible starts. In a very fresh match, Rivas is always dangerous. But somehow, even without the strap, he hooked him. Yeah, I wasn't actually that surprised in that respect. I did think that... I don't know, there was something in the air that day, but I had the feeling that that was going to go that way. I don't know why.
SPEAKER_04: I just had the feeling that the match was going to go that way. Yeah. I don't know what we were talking about that on the bus on the way over with a number of the guys. And I don't know. I just felt like Dzeranov looked massive. When we got there, he looked massive and he was so confident. Unbelievably confident. You know, you just see an arm wrestler's
SPEAKER_04: very very like just they're exuding that much confidence i've seen it from morozov a few times where you just feel like he feels like he genuinely believes he's invincible and it's a powerful weapon yeah this i don't know this i don't know he's different i i think that like how you call it savage the guy is just like he doesn't show outside but he he
SPEAKER_00: Like, you ever touch him like this? I told you before as well. The guy is like a wall. Yeah, he's just... He doesn't even move. You just hit his back, he will not move. Like, help something. You just think it's like a rock. Yeah, he doesn't... The way I described it, he doesn't look like a bodybuilder. He looks like a giant blacksmith. He's just built differently. Just built... Thick, thick. Very thick, man. Very thick, man.
SPEAKER_04: Like a primitive giant. Like something that's crawled up under a bridge and could eat your missus. Just looks like a complete monster. There are some guys that just look, they look powerful. Sagov's like that. Ibragim Sagov is just a frigging menacing looking... He's a lovely dude. I'm close to both guys.
SPEAKER_00: And this guy is different than Sagov. Sagov is more like athletic looking, moving around. This guy is just like a wall. Like, no disrespect, but just like, just came from, like, KU, you know. But it is just, even when he talks, you know, whenever he wants to write to me on WhatsApp, first he sends a voice message. He goes like,
SPEAKER_00: salam you know even the voice that the the the way he's talking is just like you know like i don't know like as man as someone can get you know this guy is real oh yeah but yeah and then we will see we will see where it will go i think that i put him against the worst possible opponent for him very tough yeah very like worst possible i i think that
SPEAKER_00: like including Hermes, Jerry, Genadi, Morozov, anyone. He has really good chances against anyone. Maybe there are two guys that, you know, is very bad stylistically or power. One is Levan, it would be, and one would be the one. But if he somehow wins this match, if he wins this one, then things will change for sure.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Yeah, I have Vitalii as a favourite. As we said the other day when we were talking about it, I do think that Lletton is a favourite for a number of reasons, but I don't know. Anything can happen, mate. Anything can happen. I've got probably 60-40 favourite for Vitalii. I do think of the Orthodox crop. He's the most dangerous threat for the top spot. Yeah. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so these are the matches and then we will have another one after the King of the Table. We will sit down and we will talk about every single match. And then, yeah, so you come in here Wednesday or Thursday? I'm hoping to be there Wednesday, mate, yeah. Wednesday and then you live in the... Okay, okay, yeah, just let's talk on...
SPEAKER_00: Uh, what's up about the details and then, yeah, yeah. We just can't wait. And, but listen, I will tell you, Neil, this is exactly what we needed. You know, what's happening right now with all those categories and the best guys, you know, in the same event, you know, there is, there is, yeah, there is not only this car that I'm talking about, but the, like right now we brought all the best guys together and now like anyone who says,
SPEAKER_04: I'm the man is right there, you understand? Yes, you've got to back it up. And like, you know, in the words of Michael Todd, exciting times. Well, it is. It is. And there's some incredible matches coming up, mate. Incredible matches coming up. The close to this year is going to be ridiculous. And the good thing is 2025 is a new year. Let's go. Yeah, it will be even better. It will be even better. And, OK, there is one super chat. Neil, what would you take?
SPEAKER_00: for you to come back to arm wrestling for real and start i don't know just i need to get closer and start taking names out probably uh the biggest answer to that is a wrist that worked some training and maybe 10 years younger
SPEAKER_04: No, mate. Listen, I'm under no illusions that I could come back at 50 years old and start beating the best guys in the world. I don't believe that's going to happen. I don't know. Is it my internet or your internet? Did I lose you then, mate? Can you hear me?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, one of us had a bad connection. I don't know which one. Yeah, right now it's okay. You hear me now, right? Yeah, I got you clear as a bell, but did I lose you there? Yeah, either you were frozen or I was frozen. I don't know which one. Okay, I was saying what it was saying. Nils, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I heard the one you read out. I don't believe that I can come back at 50, well, coming up 51 years old and start beating the best guys in the world. I think those days are well behind me. If I had a risk that worked, I'd love to come home and wrestle again, though. That's for sure. I'd love to pull matches. That'd be great. And I intend to try and do it if there's any way that I can.
SPEAKER_04: get my wrist to uh to not be uh to not be painful i would love to do that but uh we'll see what happens we'll see what happens yeah yeah okay the last thing from zero to ten how would you rate the next east west card oh bloody hell i'm not gonna say ten because you probably do a better one nine and a half
SPEAKER_04: I think it's, in my opinion, probably the best one today.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I agree. Probably the best one. I think he'll kill today the best card, I believe. Yeah, probably is. Most exciting card, yeah. Some mega, mega, mega matches. Some very exciting new guys. Yeah, I think it's awesome. A very, very strong card. By the way, I also started training, huh? I started. But this is how many times I started and something is happening. Yeah, don't bloody get hurt. I will not get you up. No way. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: yeah but that is something that you know about me right there's someone that who who doesn't like to give up never yeah yeah you ain't gonna stop you ain't gonna and that's a good thing don't go bloody back on anybody tables that scared the yeah
SPEAKER_04: But yeah, listen, it'd be great to see you come back and arm wrestle. I don't think that it's good for you to do it at East versus West, honestly. I don't think that's a good idea because you're going to be stressed off your ears. King of the table, maybe. King of the table. Better. Yeah. And maybe even armors. The best. The best idea, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: okay this is over here is 8 36 p.m let's finish here one hour 36 minutes with you as always we could i would even talk with you like 10 hours uh but i i will go and train so i appreciate i thank you very very much
