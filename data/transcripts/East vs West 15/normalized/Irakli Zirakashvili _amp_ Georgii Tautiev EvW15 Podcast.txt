SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes, I will translate. Yes, this one. Well, there's a little bit left. Yes. Yes, a normal form, in short. To make it fit. A normal form, yes? Well, yes. Engin, he says that he's 100 kilograms now. And form is normal, like close to the great. And he's...
SPEAKER_02: like trying to go as good as possible. He's trying to? He's trying to approach as good level as possible. Okay, okay. But he's feeling fine now, like he says. Okay, okay. Let's wait Irakli to come, we still have eight minutes. Is it possible you guys to turn the camera sideways? Is it possible?
SPEAKER_02: Is it better now? You need to unlock it so it will turn, you know. Yeah. Because now, Alasha, you look sideways. I look sideways? Yeah, you need to unlock the rotation of the phone. Yeah, now it's okay. Is it better now? Just wait. Uh-huh. Perfect, Norman.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, until Irakli comes, let's start talking about some other things.
SPEAKER_03: How is the you are in this from the same training group with Haji Murad? Jorgi? Are you training with Haji Murad? No, I'm training alone. Haji Murad is just starting to go to training. We go to train with him at different times. That's why he's now... I'm training alone. I'm alone in the gym.
SPEAKER_00: Engin, he says that he trains only by himself, like Haji Murad and the other people train separately. Oh, okay. He doesn't train in the gym, same gym, huh? Yes, we train in the same gym, but he doesn't train much.
SPEAKER_00: so he says that they are in the same gym but uh like the different times they are training separately okay but from the same training group same team you know in the same place the same team and same gym as well yeah okay okay and is is hajimura getting ready uh
SPEAKER_02: And he says that like Haji Murad just started training. Oh, stop? Just started training. Oh, just started training, okay. Just started training, yes. Okay. One second. I'm sharing the link on the social media and then I will be back soon, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: okay and and did lily have come back is he coming to training no okay but before he went to the work he started training for two months
SPEAKER_03: and now i think i will i will do my best so he start again i hope so but no but
SPEAKER_00: I said, it will be great. And apparently he had some work to do and it didn't work out. Georgii says that at first Lilja wanted to get in shape. He started training.
SPEAKER_00: and preparation as well at some point he was telling georgie to go to dubai or some other places to get the train and like to prepare himself but then something happened about his work job and yeah yeah patients and nowadays he doesn't trade yeah but he will come back he will come back and i will again push him and then hopefully he will he will start training again yeah
SPEAKER_02: Georgii, Irakli is coming in a few minutes. We'll wait for him, no problem. What is this? No, we will wait, no problem. Georgii, do you think that Irakli is scared of you, that's why he comes late? He asks, Irakli doesn't want to talk to you, so he's late.
SPEAKER_00: Is he afraid to speak? Yes, yes, he asks if he is afraid or not. Probably he is afraid, probably he is nervous. He has never fought with me. Well, I don't know. Now, in any case, he needs to talk. So, Engin, Georgii says that like him. Probably Irakli is afraid of him. That's why he's late. That's the reason why he's late. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, now I already started to stir the pot, you know, already. As soon as Irakli comes, the first thing I will say, Tautiev, I have said that you are afraid of him. When Irakli comes, Engin will say that he is afraid and that's why he is late. Listen, Georgii, it is my job, promoter. I understand, yes.
SPEAKER_02: No problem. No problem, right? Because some people get offended, you know, but that is all for fun, you know. Okay. Yeah, that's good that you understand. Okay. And what kind of doctor are you? What's your specialism? Cardiologist. Cardiology? Yes. And you are a surgeon? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: That is why you are very good technician at the table. There is one guy says here that you will do surgery to Irakli at the East versus West 15.
SPEAKER_00: One person in the comments says that you will do an operation on Irakli. On Irakli? God forbid that this never happens. I'll just win, but I'm not going to do the operation.
SPEAKER_02: Georgii stays very humble. He says that he hopes that operation or surgery is not going to be needed. Just victory, just sport interest and victory. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is exactly what the guy means when he said the surgery. Like he will do operation to probably his wrist is what he says. But Irakli is very sure. Irakli says that he will take your wrist.
SPEAKER_03: Irakli says that there won't be any problems with the wrist, the wrist won't go. And in the comments it was also said that the operation will be only on the wrist. Well, everyone knows, everyone already knows how I will fight. It's not a secret, I'm not going to come up with something new. I will not fight with the top.
SPEAKER_00: Let's see how strong his wrist will be. We'll see on November 2nd. So, Georgii says that everything is going to appear on the table on the 2nd of November. He's not going to turn anything upside down or something. He's just going to do the same technique that he always does and he's going to check how strong Irakli's wrist is.
SPEAKER_02: okay okay okay iraq iraq just came hmm oh like the brother has come like he says oh okay
SPEAKER_02: now finally again face to face face to face yeah exactly this guy here george said that you are late because you are afraid
SPEAKER_00: No, don't translate that part. Just say that he said he's afraid.
SPEAKER_00: so iraqi says that like the bubenko and iraqi had the after pool and iraq everyone saw what iraq did to bubenko and not only georgie but uh each and every fan of georgie is afraid of him now
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes, I will. Georgii, Irakli said that he and Bubenko then played on the right hand. And not only you, but your fans are also afraid of Irakli. I understand, I understand. Good.
SPEAKER_03: Is it true? Is it true, Georgii? After you saw Bubenko training, now you are friends? What? Oh, Engin asks, are you really afraid? Ah, a provocateur. No, no, no, of course not. I'm telling you, it's not an indicator that there's Bubenko there and Bubenko...
SPEAKER_03: This is Tautiev, right? This is not Bubenko. And Tautiev will fight with him, not Bubenko. And Tautiev is a completely different thing. Look, he barely put the camera down. You see, his hands are shaking, and he can't put the camera down. Okay, now I will translate.
SPEAKER_00: Georgii says that he's not afraid, of course. It's not true. It's not going to show everything. We're competing with Bubenko. What kind of level Irakli is. He's Georgii, like he says, and competing with Georgii is going to show everything. And at the same time, he said that when Irakli was setting the camera, his hands were shivering.
SPEAKER_00: That's why it was problematic to set the camera. OK. OK. You tell that to Irakli. Irakli. Irakli.
SPEAKER_02: Listen, exactly. First of all, I don't know, I just came here only three days ago, but your arm, right arm looks even bigger now. I don't know why. Did you say?
SPEAKER_00: So he just trained more than twice and he became bigger and stronger. Georgii, are you going to take this guy's wrist?
SPEAKER_00: Georgii, he asks, will you brush his brush? Well, there is no other option. Has anyone ever brushed his brush?
SPEAKER_02: uh there's no other way around it he's going to take his wrist like okay his wrist will be like this and then we will see if iraqi can beat him like this or not but does he think that does he think that he even stopped you know ibrahim sago shoulder press if he takes his wrist iraqi's wrist does he think that iraqi has chance against him like this or not
SPEAKER_03: Then Irakli will fight in the press. What do you think? Well, of course, if he will fight to the end, he will fight like this. But there, too, in fact, to be honest, I think it will be very difficult. Objectively, it will be difficult for me. And, of course, for him. I think it should turn out...
SPEAKER_00: Georgii, look at Irakli's wrist. Look at Irakli's wrist. Okay, I'll translate to Irakli as well. First, translate to us first.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so Gyorgy said Engin that when his wrist is going to go back, he's going to feel it in a press. There's no other way around it. But at the same time, Gyorgy said that it's going to be a very difficult battle and either guy wins, it's not going to be easy.
SPEAKER_02: But he's sure about taking the risk. But he doesn't know if Irakli is going to win like this or he's going to win with the top rope. Either way, which position it's going to be with the risk taken or the straight risk is going to be battle. Oh, it will be a hard match. OK, now you can tell Irakli. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, in Iraq, it is said that in order to be able to live in Iraq, you have to go to the border of Iraq, and then you have to go to the border of the country where you want to live, and then you have to go to the border where you want to live, and then you have to go to the border of the country where you want to live.
SPEAKER_00: So the only way, like Irakli says, the only way to win against him for Georgii is going to be to take his wrist.
SPEAKER_00: Only one way to win him. Only the wrist. You will punch him in the wrist. He says that his wrist is very strong.
SPEAKER_02: Irakli, now you said your wrist is strong and Gyorgy is laughing. Does it make you angry? What was the question, sorry? Irakli said that his wrist is very strong and when you translated this to Gyorgy, Gyorgy started laughing. Does this make Irakli angry?
SPEAKER_00: When I heard that I was going to have a baby, I told Georgii that I was going to give birth.
SPEAKER_00: I have a mission for you. On November 2nd, you will be able to go home safely. You will be able to go home safely. Irakli says that he has only one mission ahead of him on November 2nd, that this smile is going to go away. Will you translate it for me too? Yes, I will translate it.
SPEAKER_00: Georgii, Engin asked Irakli that when he said that his hand is very strong, for you it was not scary, how to say. Irakli said that on the 2nd of November he will show everything, how strong.
SPEAKER_02: He says that, he says that no more smile, but you will be crying. That's what he says. Did you know that Georgii is a heart surgeon?
SPEAKER_00: Did you know that? That's great news because now he knows how to heal himself.
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, we will stay. For the people who are watching us and don't know much about Georgii,
SPEAKER_02: Tautiev is a little over two meters. The guy is very, very tall. Gyorgy, you did not win the senior world title, right? Yes. You won the European championships. You beat Azim Razgolev. But did you win junior or youth world championships or not? Yes. You won? Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And Irakli, you also won youth or junior world championships in MAF? Yes, in the big tournament. Yes, I was in the big tournament. I was in the big tournament for the first time. When I was 22 years old, I was in Europe and in the big tournament. I was the European champion.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_00: Like Irakli mentioned that when he was 22 years old, he competed only in seniors. He won the European Championship and he placed the second. He lost to Aktaev. He won against Makarov and lost against Aktaev. No, no, but in the juniors and youth, did he win the world? So under 18, he won the world championship.
SPEAKER_02: He won, yeah? Yes, he won. Okay, there are a few, two Super Chats. One is Faz says that, congratulations on the new partner engine. Iraq, we look forward to meeting you. You are a beast. Slash love to all. See you on
SPEAKER_02: Much love, he means. Yeah, much love to all. See you on November 2nd. And Rino says, Irakli is going to bend Tautiev's wrist. And greetings from Croatia. Okay. Georgii, someone says in the comments that Irakli, your wrist will go.
SPEAKER_02: Georgii, can you tell us some of the big names that you pin in your career? Like, I know you beat Hajumrat Zolev, I think, many times. I think at least four times, maybe, or more. Georgii, I'm asking you about some of the names that you've won.
SPEAKER_02: You beat Haji Murad and you beat one time Sagov, right? One match you beat Sagov. And then you have win against Plamen Dimitrov. You have win against Gachevski.
SPEAKER_02: Yes. And did you beat Zurab? Yes. And what else did you beat? Because you have wins and, of course, some losses as well, but you have beaten some big names. Can you tell us those names that you remember? There's also Trubin. You beat Dimitrina Trubin, yeah. And who else? Who else did I beat?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I won in Europe, in the world, there are Kazakhs, there is Talgat Aktaev. You beat Talgat Aktaev? Yeah. I won. Damn, it's so hard to remember. I think Talgat Aktaev, Georgii. I remember your wins more than you remember your wins.
SPEAKER_03: He remembers your victories more than you do. Yes, I know who I beat.
SPEAKER_03: And Irakli. I won Khadaev. Well, on A1. Khadaev. Khadaev. Urtaev, if he remembers, was such a man. Well, in short. Georgii, right now, what is your chance to beat this guy? Percentage. How many chances do you have against Irakli?
SPEAKER_02: Well, look, 60 percent. How much? 50 percent. 51 percent.
SPEAKER_02: he said okay one second just say 51 51 giorgi says okay 51 giorgi and 49 iraqli okay and directly how about you 50 50. tell him does he really believe that that's not what he told me when when when like he said he said that
SPEAKER_01: Let's see, I'm going to let you ask a quick
SPEAKER_01: No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_00: Listen, you need to translate for the people who are listening first, and then you can, yeah. So he's in great shape. He says that he's in great shape now. In his heart, he feels that it's going to be 70 to 30 or 80 to 20. Georgii needs to be in amazing shape to beat him, you know? So he's assuring himself.
SPEAKER_00: Georgii, Irakli says it will be like 70-30 or 80-20. He says that he is in good shape, he feels good. And what does he think? Well, you can see from his cheeks that he feels good. Lohar says he is in good shape.
SPEAKER_02: so georgie says that that is what happens when you first translate the opponent and then he answers so we will miss it again say again okay so like georgie said that like it's visible on iraqis chicks that he's in great shape oh okay okay and iraq is this
SPEAKER_00: So Irakli is, Irakli's like the great shape, the peak that he's reaching is 99 kilograms, 100 kilograms the most. So Tautiev, Georgii, you understand his shape from the kick, not from the bicep.
SPEAKER_02: And they say that you can say if he's in good shape, not only on the cheeks, but on the wrists too. Yes, yes. Okay, exactly. You believe that you're going to beat him with top roll. This is what you told me. But somehow, if he takes your wrist, now what is the percentage? Just say the ready, go, and your wrist went back. So now what is it? 50-50 if it goes?
SPEAKER_00: Miracle says that like if wrist goes back then it's 50 50 but if not he's winning like without any issues okay so
SPEAKER_02: if the risk goes with 50 50 and then if this doesn't go he wins so he chooses between 75 that's what he says i will translate it for giorgio as well okay i understand yeah okay okay that's good okay two more super chats pause says
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so Irakli, at your best and say Levan not in preparation. How close are you guys in power? In many videos, you seem to give a good fight. Thank you. He says that Levan is no good shape and Irakli the best shape. How close they are?
SPEAKER_00: I would like to ask one more question. Damiani, if Levani is not in the form of 10% and you are in the form of 10%, how do you think he will be able to win?
SPEAKER_01: Well, it's not like that, it's just that there's a lot of work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of individual work that needs to be done, there's a lot of
SPEAKER_01: So, he rightly says that when it comes to non-competition level, when he's not 100%,
SPEAKER_00: Like when it comes to training itself, like they are close. They are close in weights and everything. Of course, Levan has the upper hand in some and Irakli has the upper hand in some as well. And like sometimes he's beating Levan, sometimes Levan is beating him. But of course, when it comes to competition, Levan is going to kill him, he says. Okay. Rino says that Irakli, ban, ban, ban. Let's go Irakli. This is what he says. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Let's go roughly. It will be fun. It will be a great match. I love it. Yeah. And OK, guys, did you, Georgii,
SPEAKER_02: Yesterday, Ivan Matyushenko, Ali Can, and Paolo, they were my guests. And when I asked them to rate the level of the East versus West 15 supermatches, and Ali Can and Ivan Matyushenko, they said they rate hundreds from hundreds. While Paolo said that he will give 97, so I can improve more for the future. What is your...
SPEAKER_00: Georgii, yesterday Ivan Matyushenko, Engin, Alizhan Muratov and Pablo talked and discussed the map that will be on November 2nd. What do you think about this map? What can you say? What matches will be there?
SPEAKER_03: I think it's probably one of the best cards he's ever collected. And I really like a few of his fights. Ivan Ivan Matyushenko with Alizhan. Betke Oniani with Zhokh. I really want to see that. It's a good fight. Petrenko with Larratt.
SPEAKER_03: No, I'm not asking the predictions yet. I will ask the predictions later.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about the level of the event?
SPEAKER_00: Okay, when Georgii is watching the card, what it looks like, he estimates like 100 out of 100, you know? But at the same time, he mentioned some matches that he's intrigued about. It's Ivan Matyushenko, Alizhan Muratov, that with Kylian Mane and Oleg Zhokh. And he mentioned about Genadi, like you mentioned about it, like Genadi and...
SPEAKER_00: If he said the prediction, don't tell now, we will ask. And you can ask the same thing for Irakli and then we just start the predictions. What does he think about the level? How would he rate? Yes, Irakli, we know Ivan Matyushenko, Ali Muratov and Pavlo Khov.
SPEAKER_00: I would like to ask you, and I think this is a very important question, what do you think about our store? I would like to say that our store is one of the most important stores in the world. It is one of the biggest stores in the world.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's a good question, and I think it's a very interesting question, and I think it's a very interesting question, and I think it's a very interesting question, and I think it's a very interesting question,
SPEAKER_00: so Engin Irakli says that like the event is that great that from starting till the last sequence you cannot relax you know you should watch every match with the most amount of like the curiosity the interest you can yeah thanks Irakli one last question you come Istanbul to win if you win do you have a goal to have two
SPEAKER_00: He says that it's his main goal to accomplish the two belts in two different divisions. And does he think that three is possible, 115 kilos as well or not?
SPEAKER_00: The first is 105, and then it goes to the 115. Georgii, do you think that Irakli can win two categories?
SPEAKER_00: What do you think, Georgii, will Irakli have a chance to win two titles in two divisions? In two categories, yes. Well, I think he will have a chance to win in the 105 category. In 105. In 105, yes? He won't be able to win in 95.
SPEAKER_00: okay like the georgie said that like the 100 uh 105 is more possible than 95 georgie said because at 95 it's it's done yeah it's done and ask ask uh georgie after he beat
SPEAKER_02: exactly let me be some provocative you know i i asked the question this way and then is he planning to 105 as well
SPEAKER_03: I like the 105th category. I feel good in the 105th category. And I think I have all the chances there. And like Irakli, I'd really like to fight Michael. Todd Hutchings, to be precise. The winner of this match will pull Todd Hutchings.
SPEAKER_00: So Georgii mentioned that he feels very comfortable in 105 as well. And he also added that he is more than willing to pull Todd Hutchings.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So, like Irakli mentioned, the two accomplished such a feat, like being called the champion of East versus West. Irakli had many sleepless nights, many training sessions and everything. He went to Istanbul many times as well, so it's not going to be that easy to take the title from him. First time when Irakli won the title,
SPEAKER_02: And Genadi wanted to put around Irakli's. Irakli said, no, stop. And he first kissed, and then he put it. I remember it was. It was unforgettable moments that this dream finally came true. Yeah, that night, Samushia, Irakli, Devon both won the world titles, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: okay there are superchats dino says dino says uh iraqi is going to beat him faster than levan eats king kali iraqi is different level in 95 kg did you hear that george yeah yeah the guy says iraqi will beat you faster than levan is king kali uh-huh
SPEAKER_00: In short, he will win me, then he will eat khinkali. Yes? Did I understand correctly? Well, they say in the comments, someone said that how Levan eats khinkali so fast and Ragly beats you.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, in fact, in these comments, whatever they write, whatever they say, I don't really read them. And when they write something like that, then I'm pleased. Imagine their faces when, well, you yourself understand.
SPEAKER_00: Like Georgii said, such comments are just motivating him and he's going to feel 10 times better when he's going to win on the 2nd of November. Yeah, Georgii, look at Irakli's wrist.
SPEAKER_02: I'll tell Georgii that these things are not what I said, these are the super chat, you know, I need to ask him, you understand? I don't want him to get me wrong, you understand? I'm not asking these questions, yeah. Faust is asking, yeah, yeah, you translate maybe, you say, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Georgii, Engin says that he doesn't invent all this, it's all in the comments, and that's why he's asking. I believe him.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Faz is asking, like, he's asking basically, he says the East versus West 15 is the gold card. Yeah, I agree with you. Faz is asking, you are a heart surgeon, and to train arm wrestling, does it make your hands, like, not steady when you do heart surgery? When you do an operation and your hand is fighting, do you have problems with your hands?
SPEAKER_03: No, absolutely no. Thank God I don't have any problems. Everything is fine. I'm going to work tomorrow. I have a day shift tomorrow. Maybe I won't, maybe I'll have surgery. We'll see. So, like, no problems at all. Like, he combines work and arm wrestling together perfectly. Okay, that's good. And Rino is also saying that Irakli is going to beat you better.
SPEAKER_02: Someone said that Irakli will win.
SPEAKER_02: Let's start from Brigitta from Hungary versus Irina Gladkaya. I'll translate to both of them to know what the subject is about.
SPEAKER_02: what do you mean subject there's no subject they are just gonna predict you know this match so so we start with brigitte yes yeah brigitta versus irina gladkaya who is winning irina gladkaya
SPEAKER_03: To be honest, I don't know Brigitta, how she fights. I don't know. Of course, I will fight for the smooth one. And if I'm being objective, I don't know. I've never seen Brigitta. It's the first time I hear it. Maybe I've seen her before, but I don't remember. But I don't know. I will fight for the smooth one. Georgii said that, like,
SPEAKER_00: just because of the estimation pure estimation he doesn't know the brigitte and but he's a fan of like the glad guy and he's gonna like root for glad guy as well and iraqi
SPEAKER_02: Irakli thinks the same way, like Vlad Kaya is going to win. Okay, let's go to Azat from Armenia versus Danil Ustinov from Kazakhstan, both world champions. And this is world title match. Who is winning? What do you think, Azat or Ustinov? Well, again...
SPEAKER_03: I haven't seen them fight that many times. One of them is fighting with a hook, and the other one is fighting with a top. I don't know. It's hard to say. I didn't watch them much. I think Stine should win. His hands are bigger than Irakli's. His hands are huge.
SPEAKER_00: uh like georgie says that like uh ustinov has more chances his hands are looking huge and at the same time he's good arm wrestler as well so he thinks ustinov but at the same time he mentioned that he doesn't know that much about like these arm wrestlers okay iraqli so iraqli says that ustinov is going to be huge favorite in this matchup okay
SPEAKER_03: And let's go to Artur Makarov vs. Ömer Kozakoğlu. What do you think, Georgii, Makarov vs. Kozakoğlu? Another hybrid, well, yes, he also has such a big hand, right? Yes, yes. And this... I don't know, it will be difficult, but I...
SPEAKER_00: I think Makarov will win. He's more experienced. I think he's more experienced. Maybe it will help him. Georgii says that like Makarov, Omar has huge hands as well. And they are pretty close by the hand size. But because of the experience level of Makarov, Makarov is going to win. Okay. Irakli?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if Makarov will be able to win, but I think he will be able to win. Irakli says that for today, Makarov is going to win, but after one or two years, the boy is going to kill everyone. Yeah, he's very new still.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's go to the other ladies' match. Dimitrina Petrova vs. Carolina Pettersson. What do you think, Georgii? Well, we've watched Dimitrina's matches with Irakli many times at the World and European Championships. She's very strong, she's very resilient. She can stand like this for 15 minutes.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, and the other one is also strong. It's difficult. I would give 50-50 here. It's difficult for this fight. I would give 50-50. You say that Dimitrina Petrova is very strong and can win, right? Yes, he can win. She is very resilient.
SPEAKER_00: Georgii mentioned that he liked watching Dimitrina Petrova many times. She's resilient, she's very strong, at the same time has great endurance. But the opponent is very strong as well, so it's still very even, like the 50-50 match. Both of them can win it. Irakli? 50-50.
SPEAKER_02: 50-50? You know, this is from one side that, like, all these athletes used to pull and waft. So everyone knows each other. Everyone knows each other, yeah. And, okay, let's go to the next category. And Davit Samushia versus Vladimir Maiorov. It's hard.
SPEAKER_03: In short, they already had a fight, they fought and they did well. It's also difficult here. Maiorov is strong, Samushia is strong. I don't know who will be better prepared to win. But as for Maiorov, I think it will be difficult for him.
SPEAKER_03: It's hard for him to increase his strength. He was strong, but he doesn't get stronger and stronger. And Samushia got stronger. He got stronger, and he increased his weight in the category. So I'd give Samushia 51, and the Major 49.
SPEAKER_00: uh georgie mentioned that uh again like every other matches like samusha and meyer match is very difficult it's the same time they pulled uh like before and they know each other's
SPEAKER_00: like capabilities, but he sees a problem with Maiorov that Maiorov is not getting the stronger, you know, the rapidly like the stronger. On the other side, Samushia is getting stronger every match. He's getting... Okay, let me cut you. Why does he think that Maiorov is not getting stronger? Because last time they pulled, Maiorov came there with like two or three months training and he was away like almost five years.
SPEAKER_02: So why does he think that he will not get any stronger?
SPEAKER_00: since he was away five years and then he only trained two three months and now he has been training one more year and why does he think that he doesn't get stronger
SPEAKER_03: And what do you think, will he be stronger or not? You know, to be honest, when they say that I trained for only two months and I'm so strong after two months, I don't believe it.
SPEAKER_03: Well, let's say I rest for five years, and then I'll train for four months, three months, and I'll be strong, I'll rest. Well, I don't believe it, really. Because now everything will be clear anyway. Maybe I'm wrong, who knows. But I don't think that Maiorov didn't train for five years.
SPEAKER_03: I trained for two months and showed this level in two months of training. I train for two months. I don't know, I don't even have three months to prepare for competitions. I'm already tired, I don't have time every day.
SPEAKER_03: I can't train. I don't know. I think he was well prepared for the fight with Samushia. And now it will be the same. Now they will fight in the same way. That's why I say it's 50-50. I don't believe it.
SPEAKER_00: so uh georgie mentions that uh the way mayor of described his preparation in preparation he does not believe in it because like he mentioned it's impossible to rest for five years
SPEAKER_00: just train for two months and come back in the way that he came back against Samushia. He showed like the big level of endurance, the great level of power and everything. Like he's not saying everything like the 100%, he knows everything.
SPEAKER_00: that 100 about mayor of that he trained or rested this way or that way but he mentions that it's impossible to show such a level of endurance in such a level no he didn't have endurance he just was good one two round and then he was out of endurance
SPEAKER_00: So it's impossible to show such a level at the world championships like Maiorov showed with just two months of preparation. That's why he still thinks that 51% is on the Samushia side and 49% on Maiorov's side.
SPEAKER_00: So he mentioned that Haji Murad Zoloyev feels perfect and amazing at 85 kilograms and at the same time he was helping like the major of the train as well.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think, what do you think about it? I don't know what to say. Davit is not going to be a strong competitor. He is a very strong opponent. He is a very strong opponent. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_00: yeah so iraqi says that uh again it's not going to be easy match david has to work so hard to accomplish this victory so
SPEAKER_00: But at the same time, he mentions that every time Davit competes, we know his capabilities, how much he works, how well-prepared he comes on a tournament. So still he considers Davit as a favourite, but it's not going to be walking apart. It's going to be very difficult for him to win. Yeah, yeah. You hear me, right? Yes, yes, we can hear you. Because right now I'm having a call, so...
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. So let's go to the next one. Oleg Zhokh vs. Betkely Onyane. Georgii, what do you think? Well, I will root for Betkely. I would like him to win. He had a good fight with him before. I watched.
SPEAKER_03: He caught up with him well. I think that when he reaches the goal he set for himself, it will be beautiful. It will be beautiful that he couldn't do it last time, but now he's gotten stronger, and now he can do it, and now he's won. Especially Zhokh, who is considered one of the strongest... Not one of the strongest, but the strongest in the world in his category with his left hand.
SPEAKER_03: Especially here, to be honest, the chances are not equal, because Zhokh has a different hand than we have. And Betkili has an ordinary hand, right? And it will be beautiful if he gathers in Oniani and wins in character.
SPEAKER_00: so uh georgie estimated you know the match in the way that um the oleg joe he's the like he said that like the greatest in his division no one is touching him at his division it's the same time he has the enormous end which he uses in his favor of course but at the same time uh he's uh he mentioned that like the he he's huge fan of like the bad kilioni
SPEAKER_00: He's supporting Betkili as well in this match. At the same time, when Zohr has such an advantage and enormous hand, Betkili has a normal hand. But at the same time, he recalled the previous match between them that it was a very good battle at some points. So Betkili's goal nowadays is to take revenge and he feels that Betkili is able to accomplish such a goal.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, and Irakli?
SPEAKER_01: In 2015, I would say that I didn't really like Betkili. I mean, he wasn't very good, but I didn't like Betkili from the finish line. I mean, Betkili didn't have all the aspects. He didn't have a good technique, he wasn't good at boxing, he wasn't good at sports, and I don't think he had a chance. In 2015, I think he had a chance to beat Betkili.
SPEAKER_00: So at 95 kilograms in this weight category, Irakli feels that Zohr doesn't have a chance because he's not going to have enough power to overpower like Betkili on that level to finish him.
SPEAKER_00: because like the jock can take his wrist take some positions but he's not going to take advantages of these positions in the way that that kill is going to have enough power to hold him and at the same time control him as well okay okay i understand okay so let me let me go to the other matches
SPEAKER_03: Yoshinobu Kanai vs. Todd Hutchings. Georgii. What do you think, Georgii? Is it Kanai or Todd Hutchings? Well, I don't know who Kanai is. I have no idea. Maybe I've seen him before, but I don't think so. I think it's Todd Hutchings.
SPEAKER_02: so georgie doesn't know that much information about kanai it's the same time he sees like what kind of shape touch is this so total is going to win in his opinion okay okay now yesterday i set a match and this these guys are very familiar you also pull against augustan kocak
SPEAKER_03: Georgii, Oguzhan Kochak vs Nugo Chikadze. 100-105 kilos. Yes, I see. I will see, yes. Nugo Chikadze, I've only recently seen him.
SPEAKER_03: I saw him fight with Larratt. I only saw him now. I don't remember when or where he fought. I fought with Oguzhan for a few years at the European and World Championships. I fought with him for a long time. And his arm...
SPEAKER_03: Georgii mentioned that he competed with Oguzhan many times. He knows his hand.
SPEAKER_00: his capabilities, what kind of uncomfortable palm and like the wrist he has himself. It's the same time he recently saw Noguchi Kaze, how he pulled. It's the same time like estimated his hand size and everything. And he mentioned that when you compare like the palm size, the finger, the wrist area and hand area in total, the Oguzhan is way bigger and it's the same time stronger as well.
SPEAKER_01: That's why he feels that like Oguzhan is going to win. Okay. Any last thing? I don't know how it's going to be. I don't know how it's going to be. I don't know how it's going to be.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think they competed with Oguzhan. I don't think they competed, no.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry, I misunderstood it. He said that he knows information about Oguzhan in the way that he was always strong. He was always competing on a high level. There were not that many people who could top-roll him as well. He knows Nugo's capabilities, how strong Nugo is. And at the same time, he estimates the situation in the way that
SPEAKER_02: Like Oguzhan did not compete for a long time, so he feels that Nugo is a slight favorite. Slight favorite, okay. Slight favorite, yes. Somebody is asking, you said that you pulled against Oguzhan many times, Gyorgy. I remember in 2018, you took his wrist, but it was a long match and I think he won by fouls. But before that, I think he also beat you. Did he ever manage to hook you?
SPEAKER_03: You fought with Oguzhan, right, Georgii? Yes, yes. And could he twist you? No. No, he couldn't. How did he beat him? Because I saw him many times he beat Georgii. How did you fight him and how did you win? I lost to him once. He won me like this. We stood like this for a long time. I was like this, he was like this. And then he won me.
SPEAKER_00: Then we stood for a long time and I won by fouls. He lost by fouls. So, Georgii said that once Oguzhan beat him by the dead wrist. Georgii took his wrist and he beat him by the press. But second that Georgii won happened by the false. There is the same position, but Oguzhan took two false and Georgii won that match.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but in the junior competition, they did final, right? Was it the final? No, I don't think it was the final. It was in the juniors or in the youth. But I don't think it was the final. I don't remember, but I don't think it was the final. It was pre-match. Georgii said that that match was not the final. He doesn't remember particularly what was it, but it was not the final. Okay, how many times Ozan won and how many times he won?
SPEAKER_03: How many times did you win, and how many times did Oguzhan beat you? Once I beat him, once he beat me. But we fought in the same category for a long time. We just didn't make it sometimes.
SPEAKER_00: So personally, they have two matches together. One was won by the Oguzhan and second one by Georgii. Oh, they only pulled twice? Twice. They competed in the same weight category like Georgii mentioned, but did not meet each other that many times. Okay, because I remember they pulled in juniors as well. Because in Antalya, Oguzhan won.
SPEAKER_03: And I think in Romania or Hungary, again, Osamu. I don't remember. He doesn't remember that particularly, unfortunately. But he remembers two matches that they had. I remember he pressed me once like this. And then he lost. I remember 1-1. But I don't remember anything else.
SPEAKER_00: So he remembers two matches, particularly first one was won by Oguzhan by the press and second one was won by Georgii by the falls. But the other matches he doesn't remember, unfortunately. Okay, okay, okay. And so let's go. The next one.
SPEAKER_02: because I remember those matches. I think they were, they pull in the junior final or something. Let's go to the, let's go to the match between Laletin and Di Dzeranov. Oh, Balin, oh Balin.
SPEAKER_03: It's a tough fight. I don't know. What do you think, Heraklis?
SPEAKER_01: As I said before, my fourth favorite song is Sistrap's Laletin. It's my favorite. If you don't like Sistrap, you can't listen to Laletin. If you like Laletin, you can listen to Laletin, but if you don't like it, you can't listen to it.
SPEAKER_00: So Irakli said that because of the technique and technique speed and high hand, Laletin is a slight favorite. But if he is able to stop by the Dzeranov, then it's going to be difficult.
SPEAKER_03: I'll translate this one to Georgii as well, because Georgii asked his opinion to Irakli. I think if Dzeranov stops him, then I think he will win, but it will be difficult to stop him.
SPEAKER_00: This is what I remember, yeah. 2016 Europeans. Ozan Koçak first.
SPEAKER_02: Baysangur, Salty, Kano second and I think you took third place. Georgii Tautiev is third place. And I remember as final match, but I think it was semi-final match, semi-final, yeah. Yeah, yeah, semi-final. Yeah. Anyway, so what is basically they are saying who is winning?
SPEAKER_00: so like the both of them said basically the same that like a technique the hand size the speed everything uh lalatin is ahead but still if match stops and uh if lalatin is not able to hit the start hit the first like the hit and the hand stops then zeranovi is going to take over
SPEAKER_02: Oğuzhan, do you know these guys? Irakli, Zira Khashbili. Can't you see them from there? No, I don't have the time right now. Okay. There's something here. There's Georgii Tautiev and Irakli. I don't remember Georgii. How many times did you play with Georgii?
SPEAKER_02: I competed with him in 2015. Did you compete with him in 2015? I competed with him on the left, he beat me on the left and I beat him on the right. Okay, he says that in 2015, Europeans, you beat him left arm, he beat you right arm. Sofia. Georgii, he says that in 2015, he beat me on the right arm. In 2016, you won the European Championship, he beat you on the left arm. What a good memory he has. I don't remember at all.
SPEAKER_02: I was 3rd, I got injured on the left. Tautiev was 4th. When the first two doping tests came out, I was 1st and he was 2nd. Okay. He says that in 2015, Malaysia, Wap Wars, with left arm, Oğuzhan was 3rd, you were 4th. But the first place, second place tested doping positive. And then Oğuzhan was 1st and you were 2nd, yeah. Yeah. 10 years ago.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
SPEAKER_02: Dzeranov is very very strong right now yes yes yes yes very very strong okay we understand each other and then let's go let's go to let's go to the next one Michael Todd versus Genadi Kvikvinia well here I'm not sure if Genadi will win
SPEAKER_00: I said everything. Can you tell us why? First of all, they already had an armfight.
SPEAKER_03: And Genadi knows what to do there. He knows any point where Michael Todd would have to fight. There is no point where Genadi wouldn't have stopped him. There are no options here. How should he win it? I can't imagine in which direction Michael Todd should fight to beat Genadi. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: mm-hmm so biorgi says that because they had a match already and gennady has the experience which like the point he had to he has to hit to win
SPEAKER_00: uh that's why gennady is going to win as well because he knows what to do with michael's hand it's the same time he doesn't imagine the way how like the michael is able to defeat the gennady he had a very recent biceps surgery
SPEAKER_02: by step there gennady michael has it but michael had three matches after that and he is in good form and this is gennady's comeback match first match does he think that he can be he can be as good already george he says that gennady had an operation michael also had an operation on his right arm on his biceps but after that michael had three fights
SPEAKER_03: And for Genadi it's a comeback. What do you think? Will he be in good shape? I don't know. We'll have to see. I saw them face-to-face with Aguinashvili in Batumi.
SPEAKER_00: And Genadi seems to have big hands. I think Danya will win anyway.
SPEAKER_00: I think it will be a very interesting matchup for Irakli. It's going to be a very good battle. But at the same time, for him, Genadi is still a favorite. Still a favorite, okay. Okay, then let's go to another match.
SPEAKER_03: Rino Masic vs. Ibragim Sagov. What category is it? 115. And this is a world title match. And it will be for the title too. Yes, yes. I thought Sagov should win. I thought his move there was stronger than Rino's move there.
SPEAKER_03: I don't like to watch fights in such a technique, when both are in such a technique, when one is a top, and the other is... How to say it? I don't know. Presser. Yes, then it can be interesting.
SPEAKER_00: So he feels that because this movement, this particular movement, when they're pressing, that's the main movement of them, in that particular movement and dragging people to that point, Ibragim Sagov is much stronger. And he feels that Ibragim Sagov is going to take over and win as well.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think? It's a very interesting game and there are many advantages to it. I think it will be a very interesting game, but I think it will be a very interesting game.
SPEAKER_00: So Irakli says that they are like the same type of pullers. They love to press. It's a very interesting battle, but because of the strength in that particular movement, he feels that Sagov is going to win as well. Okay, let's go to the last two matches.
SPEAKER_03: Alizhan Muratov vs. Ivan Ivan Matyushenko. This is a very historical match. Like, incredible match. How do you see this, Georgii? I think it's a very good fight. But I think... I will root for Ivan Matyushenko, but...
SPEAKER_03: I'm worried about him. Alizhan is very strong. Especially with his left hand. He's incredible. He's even stronger than Irakli. It's hard to say. I support Ivan Matyushenko.
SPEAKER_03: If only from the start, Ivan Matyushenko will not transfer him to his comfortable position and take the center a little bit, so that he does not give him the center. If he takes the center here a little bit, then there will be more chances. Well, let me give 55 to Olezhan, 45 to Ivan Matyushenko.
SPEAKER_00: So he feels that big favorite, like the slight favorite, is the Alizhan Muratov compared to Ivan Matyushenko. And he feels that if Ivan is able to drag him from the center in his comfortable position, like right here, his senses are going to increase. But at the same time, he feels very nervous for Matyushenko because the Alizhan is amazingly strong in his left hand.
SPEAKER_01: Why? Well, first of all, I would like to say that I don't want to go back to March. March was a very difficult time for me. It was very difficult for me to go back to March. And I don't want to go back to March. I want to go back to March. And I want to go back to March.
SPEAKER_00: For Irakli, it's like a 60-40 towards Alizhan. And he feels that in the near future, no one is going to be able to beat Alizhan Muratov. That's how strong he is. Does it include Vitalii Laletin? I would like to say that Alizhan and Laletin are both strong.
SPEAKER_03: For Irakli, it's going to be one of the most intriguing and interesting matches that it is. And you, Georgii, who would you think they would win? What do you think, Georgii, Laletin or Alizhan Muratov? I think Laletin will win. I watched when Alizhan fought Gasparini. And then Gasparini, he didn't have enough time to open his fist.
SPEAKER_00: Laletin's hand is not comfortable. I think Laletin will be able to open his wrist. So I think Laletin will win. So for Georgii, when he watched the match between Ermes Gasparini and Alizhan Muratov, for the errors it took a bit more power to open Alizhan's wrist.
SPEAKER_00: he was not able to but it was some like the small portions when he was like straight like this for one moment yeah open a bit so when he compares hermes hand and speed towards like a lalatin speed like lalatin here so he is saying that if hermes did this lalatin would take the hand lalatin will do more
SPEAKER_02: He has more capabilities to do that. Before we go to the last match, I want to ask you directly. You are the champion right now, but you have lost a few matches. Right now, you are pulling against a very good top roller. For you, is it a goal to prove to people that you will not risk again?
SPEAKER_00: Because I realized that he's bothering him. He doesn't want people to think that his wrist is problematic. He wants to prove that he has very strong wrist.
SPEAKER_00: Tell Georgii the last sentence.
SPEAKER_00: Or everything. It's much better to translate him everything. Georgii, they say that Irakli is a champion now. But before that, he lost. Before that, he lost. And the opponent, how to say, his hand was not that strong.
SPEAKER_00: And now he thinks that his brush is strong and no one will twist it or open it. And Heracles said that his brush is stronger than it was before.
SPEAKER_00: Georgii says that like it's a great news because if he was weak then it's not it was not going to be that interesting to compete against him.
SPEAKER_02: So tell Irakli that he says that he is happy that he fixed that problem, otherwise it wouldn't be an interesting match. He says thank you.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, let's go to the last match. Devon versus Oleg Petrenko. Devon Larratt versus Oleg Petrenko. He thinks that Petrenko is going to win.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think it's because of the weight?
SPEAKER_03: I think it's because of everything. Because of the weight he lost. I thought Petrenko wasn't that strong, but he turned out to be very strong. Physically, Petrenko is very strong. Therefore, if he also added a little more in technique than before, then I think he has a lot of chances to win.
SPEAKER_00: So Georgii explains that it doesn't have only one reason why Petrenko is going to win. The biggest part is going to be for Devon to lose his weight. But at the same time, Petrenko is very strong physically. He's amazingly strong. And at the same time, he got much better technique right now, experience and everything. That's why all these things together is going to
SPEAKER_00: the uh the solve the puzzle that is called devon blart um
SPEAKER_01: My dream is to become a wrestler. And a wrestler for my age is Petrenko. Petrenko is a wrestler. But I don't want to lose weight in our sport.
SPEAKER_01: He thinks that it's always great when the most powerful one or the best one wins
SPEAKER_00: But at the same time, nothing happens by just according to plan or just straight away. Petrenko might be physically stronger than Devon, but at the same time, experience, table IQ, everything is decided. And for that many reasons that Devon is so experienced, so clever, knows that many things to how to work on the table. That's why for this many reasons, Devon is going to win. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And Peter is asking, hello, Engin, can you please ask Irakli some good top roll exercises? See? See? He shows. He puts his hand. And.
SPEAKER_00: Yes. So he says that such a training and such a position training is the best one for the top role. And at the same time, the results of this type of training is going to be shown on 2nd of November. Tell, tell the girl.
SPEAKER_00: Georgii, someone asked in the comments, Irakli asked, tell me what is the best training for Toprol, for Toprol, for Verkhovnik. Irakli showed this, Luch showed, and said that on November 2, the results of this training will be in the camera.
SPEAKER_03: Well, first of all, why do they ask Irakli what's the best exercise for the top players? I'm the best top player of all time. Why do they ask him? I don't understand.
SPEAKER_00: okay okay uh georgie said that like uh the first of all it's the the most uh curious question is that why they are asking it to iraqli and not to him you know because he feels that he's the best like the top roller in the world best what best top roller in the world he feels like he's the top roller and the question has to be asked towards him not to iraqi
SPEAKER_02: oh okay okay okay okay yeah yeah the guy just wrote that he accidentally wrote iraqli he was gonna write georgie out here the guys he apologized now
SPEAKER_01: And I think that's why you were saying in the comments that you were tired. Yes, of course, I was tired. I went to school and went to the gym. I didn't want to lose weight. I went to school and went to the gym.
SPEAKER_00: so irakli said that like there's no mistake about it he's the best top roller like he feels because even the school boy was able to drag him to the cook georgie to the hook okay tell the guy why are you telling me georgie irakli
SPEAKER_03: When I was sparring, you know, there are people who are strong behind the scenes. I'm not talking about schoolboy, I'm talking about myself.
SPEAKER_03: I can lose in training. Even if I put all my strength into it, I can lose. No matter what. I've never fought well in training, or behind the scenes after competitions. Like Irakli wins everyone behind the scenes. That's never happened to me. But in competitions, I...
SPEAKER_00: so eng in georgie said that uh like the after pool or training session is not the best like the thing that can show is he how strong he is you know it's the same thing he explained it like
SPEAKER_00: Not everyone is able to win after-pause or training sessions. Even at some point when he's trying his 100%, he's not winning or on training sessions, you know? Okay. That's why. Now I want you to translate.
SPEAKER_02: what he said to iraqi but not as as george said translate him as george said as i said tell him that george says if practice pools would matter now he likely would have the superhero weight belt tell me as i said okay okay
SPEAKER_00: He rightly says that at some point in his career he was he's gonna have
SPEAKER_02: the super heavyweight title and the giorgi streams becoming the champion is going to stay as a dream since it was before another thing another thing okay okay people say that school boy did better in practice against georgie than against uh iraqi but
SPEAKER_02: somebody told me that school boy trained table training in georgia even day before he trained in iraq is that true uh you want that one me asked to georgie or to iraqi now you want
SPEAKER_02: That one, me ask to Irakli? Irakli, Irakli, Irakli. Because people, we saw Irakli easily beating schoolboy. But somebody told me that Irakli did the table training day before. And then when he trained Irakli, it was his second day in a row. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: In this sense, it is possible to say that if we do this, we will be able to go to the next level and we will be able to do what we are supposed to do.
SPEAKER_01: I played in the national team and then I played in the national team. I played in the national team for the first time. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't know how I would compare myself to the champion. I don't
SPEAKER_01: Yes, but I don't think so. I don't think it's important for me. I think it's important for Georgii and for the whole world.
SPEAKER_00: so iraqi says that like the maybe maybe this guy is the school boy trained himself before this like the after polo training session but he luckily did not rest as well he is in shape he's training almost every day and at the same time he said that like uh the school boy felt that weaker no disrespect towards him just felt that weaker that he could not even beat him like in the sleep okay
SPEAKER_02: Okay, guys, thank you very, very much, Georgii. And thank you very much, Irakli. Georgii, after your top roll, Irakli, will you talk with him or you will just pin him? When you are in this position, when he goes to the wrist, Irakli, will you talk to him or just...
SPEAKER_00: No, I'm not going to talk to him. I'm just calm. We're not showmen, we're athletes. You're not going to say anything, right?
SPEAKER_02: so maybe he's going to say let's go iraqli language means a boy let's go boy okay okay i'm just trying to just laugh you understand have fun nothing serious okay iraqli do you have any last word before we finish
SPEAKER_01: What did you want to say? What did you want to say to Irakli? No, Irakli, of course, I want to say that I am very happy to be here with you. I am very happy to be here with you. I am very happy to be here with you.
SPEAKER_00: mm-hmm okay iraq feels that as soon as like event comes it's going to be better because like uh he feels that he's in peak right now and uh it's way like as soon as this event comes it's going to be easier to shut this boy up
SPEAKER_02: Okay, he's going to shut his mouth up. And it will be the last time he will be talking like this about Irakli. Okay, I understand. Irakli says that he's going to win in the way that then Georgii is going to be his biggest fan. Listen, I said I'm going to finish it, but you need to translate this.
SPEAKER_00: Yorgi, Irakli says that he will beat you in this form. After this fight, you will be a big fan of Irakli. I'm already a big fan of Irakli. Irakli's fight is beautiful, but I'll just be stronger. But I have a question.
SPEAKER_03: Irakli, if you lose, what will you do? I wonder what his future actions will be like. He will lose to me. What will he do next? Who will he fight with? Or will he ask me for revenge? What will he do? I'm just curious. So, Georgii said that it doesn't matter what happens. He's a fan of Irakli in the way that he likes the way Irakli pulls and everything.
SPEAKER_00: But at the same time, he has his questions as well towards Irakli in the way that when he is going to lose against Georgii, what is going to be the future plans?
