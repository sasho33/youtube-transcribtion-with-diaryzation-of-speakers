SPEAKER_04: I've been blessed to have a lot of people help me on this journey. Um, so yeah, I think things are moving the right direction, but I appreciate it. I mean, it's nice to hear compliments, but I do, I do feel like I look different, you know, like I look different than I have in the past and as a super heavyweight, you know, me to stop it. My cat's doing one of my chargers. Go ahead. Roman, did you reach Kennedy?
SPEAKER_03: I'm keep trying to reach, I mean, messages delivered. If Genadi does the same exact thing once again, I mean, Genadi will be in trouble with me, you know. No, no, he said he has time. Yes, yes, but I said, look, you ready for Michael YouTube podcast? I'm ready. When? Tomorrow after p.m. your time. I said, tomorrow, 23, Tbilisi time. He said, okay. I sent him the message and
SPEAKER_03: He better come. Otherwise, otherwise. I will call him right now. You're talking with him right now? I will call him. You call him from Messenger? No, in WhatsApp. I can try Messenger too. This time I will try my WhatsApp. Yeah. If this happens again, Michael, we're going to make you start 1-0 with the match. There you go. Yeah. He will deserve it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. And how is everything? Like, is there anything changed? We didn't talk long ago. We had a podcast with you. And like, you're done with training 12 days? So basically, I had planned originally to do my arm wrestling specific lifts every other day. Originally, it was every day. Then I changed my programming to every other day because the weights were so heavy that it was becoming pretty taxing.
SPEAKER_04: And then last Wednesday, last Tuesday, I was supposed to do another lift on Thursday, ended up talking to Rebecca and talking to Devon. They convinced me to quit going so heavy this close to the match. So instead of doing five more PRs up until this Friday, I just did this last Friday, I did all my arm wrestling specific lifts and hitting new PRs on everything. And then now it's just, I'm doing my normal, like today I did chest workout with hand and wrist.
SPEAKER_04: Tomorrow I'll do back with hand and wrist. Then I'll do shoulder to hand and wrist. Arms, hand and wrist. And then I'll do legs, hand and wrist on Friday and that'll be it. But I mean, I'm done with all the arm wrestling specific stuff and all the PR stuff. Hey, Genadi came. Just tease him a little. All right. Davit says that looking huge, Michael. You got this. All right. There you go. How are you? I'm well, sir. How you doing?
SPEAKER_00: Thank you very much. You are welcome. Thank you very much. I would like to say thank you to all of you. Thank you to all the guests. I wish you all the best. I wish you all the best. I wish you all the best. I wish you all the best. I wish you all the best.
SPEAKER_02: So, first of all, hello, guys, everybody else, Engin and Michael and whoever is watching us right now live. And Genadi basically laid out the plan of tonight's live stream. He said that, first of all, I'm going to start feeding off of the energy that I'm taking from Michael. I'm going to feed on that energy, entire podcast. And then I will go back and wish you all the best.
SPEAKER_03: place peaceful like all right there is a super chat fanatic system says that ain't no way Genadi is pushing through this shoulder one of the fan things that like Michael's shoulders are super strong and Genadi has no chance pushing
SPEAKER_02: One thing I would like to say is that Mike's career has been very good, he has been very successful, and he has done a lot of good things. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's a shame that Michael is young, he's a great athlete, but he's going to have to deal with the fact that he's going to lose a lot of weight. I would like to ask you, Mkhari, Mklavi, Titi, Maja, Tliantani, Zdala, Ravitsi, what would you like to say to them? I would like to ask them to stop thinking that they don't have the right to do this.
SPEAKER_02: well Michael is a strong really powerful athlete no doubt and we have seen him getting even stronger lately but regardless of how many fans are spamming about his strength there's no way whatever tool Michael has against me whether it's a shoulder or it's wrist or fingers or anything else I will just let him I will after match I will make him
SPEAKER_02: to feel so exhausted and so tired that he would be thinking, I should never come here for the first place. Michael, don't ask me to ask you something. Listen, I think Genadi is an amazing athlete. I asked for this match because
SPEAKER_04: we both are coming off uh bicep surgeries um he does have the the only victory in our we actually beat me left-handed in 2009 World Championships as well so I've never beat Genadi um it's a very important match and I'm excited about uh getting on the table so I mean I know both of us are confident that we're gonna win only one of us is going to and uh
SPEAKER_04: I don't even want to say let the best man win. Let the man that's supposed to win win, right? I think this thing's already been written. I think the outcome's already been written. Yeah, yeah, always. Always, yeah. But you are, what were you telling him that, like,
SPEAKER_04: Like, what were you saying? You made the video and then, like, not video, you wrote there, like, again, I did there, like, 17 days. And what was it exactly, the sentence? Well, okay, I'm going to go ahead and break the... Oh, shit. Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. So we have our cat outside and our bandit, which is our baby pit bull, and the cat don't get along.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, Misha's over here. Okay. So, man, it just came out the gym door and Misha was running wild. So we almost had a catastrophe. You know what I'm saying? Those two go at it. This whole place would be in shambles. Yeah. So I'm going to go ahead and break the news.
SPEAKER_04: Wait. Hey, Rebecca, tell me not to say it yet. Okay. Are you coming around? I am trying. She's trying to save her cat. Hang on a second. A little bit of drama. Okay. I can't say yet. I'm going to have to answer that question when Rebecca comes back. But let's talk about something else and we'll come back to that one in just a minute because it's kind of funny.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. How about the, the, the, the, the eating, eating, eating, uh, thing, you know, you, you, you put all the food and then you ask, by the way, what's your weight Genadi? 140? 147 kg. Oh yeah. I thought I was going to say 150, but 147. That's good. I won't be that big. Yeah. And, and who is more, more ripped?
SPEAKER_02: who has more muscle and less fat. This is Genadi's answer. Genadi, I would like to ask you a question. What is your opinion about weight loss? Well, as I said, I am not a weightlifter. I don't have a lot of weight, as you said.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if it's true or not, but I don't know if it's true or not, because I don't know my genetic pattern, that is, I don't know how to do bodybuilding, and my own style is probably to say that I don't know how to do it, but I think that during this period, I will get used to it, and I will be able to do it with my body, but
SPEAKER_00: We, Georgii, like to go out into the city and eat this khachapuri, khinkali, and then eat these things that we like, and I'm not saying that all of us are allergic to these things, but I'm sure that I don't like the fact that I'm a bodybuilder.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think it's my fault that there's a whole bunch of press here and there. I don't think it's because of the fact that one Georgii person is a chameleon, and the other one is a Dalai Lama. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: First of all, I'm not... We are not doing bodybuilding. That's what he said. That's what I gathered.
SPEAKER_02: yes and he he was mainly focusing on uh explaining that he never followed the diet as a bodybuilder or he never cared about small like tight thin waist and bright shoulder it's just naturally whatever the shape he gets after workout and after um exercises it is so
SPEAKER_02: his current shape visually is no anything different that we have never seen so far so um when it comes to him dieting he has always been like eating whatever he wants and in georgia and georgian cuisine is always like full of everything basically carbohydrates and fat and also protein and stuff so
SPEAKER_02: uh canadi one more time uh said that main focus for me has been the power has been the muscles like to function and do what they supposed to do i never cared about my look as if as a bodybuilder would may do so at the end of the day georgian food delivers more power so that's what i care about okay let's go michael the part that you were gonna say when when rebecca you got the cat right
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. All right. So Rebecca didn't hear the question, but he asked, he goes, what did you say? You only have 17 days left.
SPEAKER_03: And then you will think about it if you have done enough or something. Like what I understood that 17 days later, like in this last 17 days, he will just look at your photos and then think that like, did I do enough to beat this guy? That's how I took it. But how was it? What does it mean? That is a very good interpretation. The funny thing is I didn't write it. She did. Like I've done none of this. Oh, that's good. That's normal.
SPEAKER_01: you're like oh my god michael never does this look what michael did i still haven't done that rebecca did it better better pro better promotion than you do he's the best promoter we got buddy i mean i'm listening to all of this stuff and it's like oh i respect him so much as an athlete you know i wanted this match i just want to be my strongest on the day and i'm going in my brain i'm going okay i need milk bread what else do i need at the grocery store because i can't pay attention when it get
SPEAKER_01: Wake me up. Do something exciting. You know, like I want to know from Genadi. Genadi, what is it going to look like when you spank Michael's butt? Back down to the heavyweights. Back down to the heavyweights. And Michael, how are you going to keep him from spanking your butt? You know, that's what I want to know. I want some excitement.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah so she's just having fun but it's funny to watch because of your reaction I know you were just trying to promote it but I'm like I didn't even know it was up because I went and saw it and I was like oh so I said that you know okay but you you did do the um whatever you're eating is not enough yeah yeah but I mean also that was scripted she told me what to say someone says someone commented to Michael
SPEAKER_01: um Genadi is 375 pounds go ahead tell him what you said then oh I said that's not big enough Michael says I'm gonna walk up to Genadi and go if Genadi's 335 I'll go poke his belly and go we know a 375 is not a fit Genadi so but yeah it was just
SPEAKER_04: It's funny how people start talking on social media about how big this guy or how big that guy is or how strong this guy is. And I know Genadi has to have tested himself already. Like he has a great group of people to test himself against. What I can say that I believe in my heart, he will have never seen or felt what he's going to feel on the table that day.
SPEAKER_03: In his whole career, he never felt something that what you are bringing to the table. Roman, go ahead. Man, I want to say that and say it to be true. I genuinely do. Michael, just object. I think I'm in a very special place right now. I know that you believe and you really look that way. I don't know what the result is going to be, but you really look very dangerous. Roman, just tell Genadi that Michael says that he's going to feel something that he has never felt before.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to say that it is very important that you and Magida come together, because Genadi is a great man and he knows how to do things that are impossible to do without him. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_00: Laratma, you don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you? You don't like Georgii, do you?
SPEAKER_02: why is it uh like this that you or mike and uh devon can't seem to learn that georgians are your limits like you can't beat us like whatever you are promising i'm telling you you have no idea the shape i'm coming to you and uh
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I know you hope that I had some injuries. I know that you think that I may have not fully recovered from it, but trust me, I feel really good. I feel excited about our match. And likewise, for your example, you had also a pretty severe injury and look who we have today. So trust me when I'm saying that I'm going to deliver something that you have never felt before. That's what I want to hear.
SPEAKER_00: Are you sure your elbow is not going to pop back when I press you down to the pin pad? So honestly, I don't think he's going to attack me with a press. If that's the plan, that is a flawed plan.
SPEAKER_04: That's not the way to beat me. He's going to need to bring something else. He wants to climb up and then do that. That's a much better approach. That's a much better approach. If the original plan is to flop your wrist and try to pin me, don't try that. It's a bad idea. Now, if you can do the other one where you climb and get over my hand. The thing is, you're going to have to beat my hand. You're going to have to beat my hand.
SPEAKER_04: And listen, I'm excited. I would love to do this right now. I'd be happy to do it today. I'd be happy to do it tomorrow. We do it every single day. We can run this thing every day. I've done all the work. I'm very confident in the work that I've done.
SPEAKER_04: And I'm excited to showcase that on the table, but not for me. I don't, like I said, I told you in the other day, I'm not looking for accolades. I'm not looking for praise. I'm not looking for anything. I truly believe that I'm at a time in my life where I get to show the world what's possible. And I truly believe that God's working through me for that reason. Not because I'm special, because I'm better. I'm just a vessel that he's using. I genuinely believe this. So we'll see. We'll see. But I'm excited and I'm confident.
SPEAKER_00: Roman, no matter what you do, you don't have to press, you don't have to do this, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that, you don't have to do that,
SPEAKER_02: Mike, I know that throughout the history of my career, I've been trying to execute that specific move that we are talking about. And neither Tim Bresnan nor Lewon himself, neither you nor Devon have managed to successfully defend against it.
SPEAKER_02: it may be clear to say that even ahead of the jerry i have the block priest the best or maybe after jerry i have the best floppers but throughout the history i have never failed to execute that move successfully so every time i used it it was ending successfully good deal
SPEAKER_03: Okay, I will just read two Super Chess. Ustinov Barak Zayi says, and Henry Nehring asked Genadi what style he's training to beat Mike in. And he already said, Arne, he wants to go such way. And then I see one more Levan Spears show. Genadi, can you move Michael off center? Can he move Levan off center?
SPEAKER_02: i don't even think about uh not succeeding in that part i have a question
SPEAKER_02: What does Genadi think his ranking is? If he was to be ranked right now in the overall in the world, where does he think he sits? Genadi, I want to ask you a question. What do you think is the most important thing for you as a player? What do you think is the most important thing for you as a player?
SPEAKER_02: I deserve where I'm standing right now in the rankings. That's where I believe I am currently, but for sure I'm going to rank higher in the future. The way ES vs. West is doing the rankings, I personally feel that I belong to where I'm ranked right now.
SPEAKER_02: Genadi, do you believe that you beat Devon by the help of the ref, as some of the fans claim? Genadi, I think it's normal. It's a very good thing. I think it shows that Devon knows that he's going to win in some way or another. I think he's going to win in some way or another. What do you mean?
SPEAKER_00: There was a moment when I thought to myself, I didn't want to miss this moment, I didn't want to miss it. One by one, one by one, one by one, one by one, one by one, one by one.
SPEAKER_00: Meda Devon was born and he was born in Bolon. He was born in Bolon. That is to say, whatever we do, whatever we do, we do it for the sake of the people. But Meda Devon was born to be born. We don't have to do anything to be able to do it. I don't mean to say that we have to do technical work. At one point, when I met Larratt Maduila, he told me that he was born in Bolon. This is technical work, it is not necessary to be able to do it in technique.
SPEAKER_00: Chuen Shor was very aggressive towards Magida and he was very aggressive towards the two sides. There is no doubt about it, it is clear that Davushu had something to do with the game, and it is important to note that the game was played by Genadi's team and Larratt's team.
SPEAKER_00: All of a sudden, there was a strong wind, but we didn't expect it to be this strong. Because everyone was afraid, especially the sportsmen. They were aggressive at the beginning of the match, but we didn't know what to do in the end.
SPEAKER_00: It was 100% real, and I'm sure that if I were to do the same, I would be able to do this.
SPEAKER_02: uh he disagrees completely with the statement that as if referees helped him to win or somehow decisions that referee made uh led him to the victory no way uh canadi uh reminisced about the uh respectful approach from both athletes himself and the devil to each other and towards the arm wrestling itself they never tried to take
SPEAKER_02: their match to the ugliness that would cause referees to do inefficient or unfair decisions. In Genadi's mind, this match was, if not the best, at least one of the best fighting matches that referees let athletes to fight. And if there was mistakes, referees managed to call them properly.
SPEAKER_02: And also because of these respectfulness that they showed towards each other, even though they were trash talking during the matches, of course, still because of this respect that they had to the armwrestling itself and also to each other, they never
SPEAKER_02: turn the the match into some uncomfortable uh situation for the refs so he believes that referees 100 did their job there and also some fans encountered to him not only georgians but whenever he was encountering fans when he was in istanbul in other events and everybody were talking about his match versus devon they were saying that that match was one of the best match on east versus west so yeah
SPEAKER_03: He totally disagrees that somebody got advantage by referee. Okay. Genadi, the winner of this match is gonna pull against Ermes. And what do you think if Ermes and Michael would pull against each other? Just say that you didn't pull, but Michael and Ermes are pulling. How do you see their chances against each other?
SPEAKER_02: And Genadi, as you can imagine, this match, this match between you and Michael, will be played by Hermes, which means that he will be able to win the first number. And the fact is that Michael will be able to play against Hermes. Genadi, this is also interesting. Your opinion on this match between Michael and Hermes? Well, that's not a fact. It's a fact. It's a fact.
SPEAKER_00: If you like Michael and if you don't like him, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can go to one of his shows, if you want to, you can
SPEAKER_02: we can we can do it like this uh after i'm beating the hermes and i'll go for the number one we can manage if fans are excited to see for the second place hermes versus michael and then i will answer that question right now i don't i don't i just don't see that you think that this match is not going to exist even i said they just say that this must
SPEAKER_03: Can I do Michael Disney? Michael, what do you think about this? But your opponent is very, very confident, Michael. He says that you have no chance. And this is what I love about this match. I see how ready you are, Michael, mentally, spiritually.
SPEAKER_03: Basically, I have never seen you like this while there is a Genadi that, I mean, I don't know where he is at. Because, like, you came, you pulled Lamparelli, you pulled Lars, and then you pulled Kamil.
SPEAKER_03: And we saw that you progressed. Like your match versus Lamparelli, I don't think that is the shape that you would like to face Genadi, right? But we saw that you claim the letters. While he just came here, in the first match, he's going to pull against probably the best shape of Michael. So we don't know. But two times I underestimated that guy. When he pulled against you, first time, I remember at the press conference, I asked him, do you really believe yourself you're going to beat Michael? He said, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: i was like okay and he won that one and then whenever at the press conference whenever he was doing the trash talk with devon i thought that he was intimidated when he was like like when he was asked by devon if i'm not mistaken the loser is gonna he would you cut it would you shave your beard and he said no so i was like maybe he doubted himself but it wasn't the case so there is no way there is one person that i would never underestimate in our missing this is
SPEAKER_04: Genadi and he looks very confident what is your take about all this I wholeheartedly hope that Genadi is as strong as he thinks he is I really do because I want this to be two people in very good form arm wrestling to find out you know who's better on that day um
SPEAKER_04: It's funny because we have the same goal, right? Yes. The winner pulls Hermes. The winner of that pulls LeBron. How do you know LeBron? Come on, come on, come on. Okay, LeBron or Jerry, I get you. Because we don't know. My mind tells me that the lane that Jerry wants to attack LeBron is the wrong lane. I don't think it's possible. Go ahead. I don't think it's possible, but Jerry might prove us wrong.
SPEAKER_04: Because if Jerry gets him in a bond and Jerry puts a brakes on it, Jerry gets on his shoulder and LaVon hangs on too long, that big bicep can feel full of blood and who knows what happens. I obviously think LaVon's going to win, but Jerry is a unique individual and he might pull it out.
SPEAKER_04: But as far as if you don't know how to pull against him, you may. Oh, of course. Of course. And going back and because I revisited Jerry versus Genadi the other day. And my take on that match was Genadi was going to kill him. And then Jerry fought hard. You know, Jerry put out the win, which was a crazy match. So you can never underestimate Jerry either. Just like you can't underestimate Genadi at no point.
SPEAKER_04: Even since when we talked that if I beat Camille, I get to pull Genadi, at no point have I underestimated the level that is Genadi and the level that Genadi can bring to the table. I just believe that on that day, it's going to take a superhuman performance to beat me. That's what I think. Can I ask you something, Michael? Just say that it wasn't Genadi.
SPEAKER_04: On the November 2nd, would you be ready for anyone? Or not yet? You know what I mean. I know what you mean. And I have been very, very strategic about how I've spoke in this comeback. I've always said I will never say I'm strong enough. I always need to be stronger.
SPEAKER_04: And I've always said, I need more time for this guy. I need more time for that guy, the way things are going right now. And I'm going to say something that I am going to criticize for so much. I just forget about the criticism. This is where I believe we're going to find out. We're going to find out in 12 days where I'm at. Let me guess. Do you feel like you are ready to pull?
SPEAKER_04: Anyone on November 2nd? I know that's the question. I know that's the question, but that was not the answer I was going to give you. The answer that I was going to give you, because I actually said this to Rebecca the other day, and it was a feeling that came across. The way this preparation is going, this is a scenario that will never happen.
SPEAKER_04: But I told Rebecca, I said, if something happened in this match on November 2nd, if something happened with Genadi and the match wasn't able to happen, and then something happened with Jerry and he wasn't able to, I felt like I could be ready by December 14th to pull a Vaughn. I don't know why. It's just something that hit me a few days ago. This prep has went so, and this has been the most difficult prep I've ever had. I had diverticulitis, I got GERD, I had all kinds of shit that was happening.
SPEAKER_04: i still read right right now since since the comment match yeah yeah like i lost 15 pounds i don't know you you seem like everything is going well you know i went through all kinds of adversity in this camp and i've and now i'm back the heaviest i've been i'm i surpassed all my only goal i didn't beat was a potential goal that i had for a pronation lift but i still have an insanely high pronation like i don't know man it was just so weird i told i told myself yesterday i said
SPEAKER_04: I really think if things happened in that way, which they never would, I think I could be ready. I think I could be ready. That's not how I want it to happen. I want to have a successful match against Genadi. I want to prove where my level is. I want to come back home. I'm going to shake Genadi's hand and come back home and start training for the next match, right? With full intentions of doing the same thing and then finally getting that shot of the match I wanted for so long.
SPEAKER_04: and like i said i said this rebecca i was like i don't care about being overall number one in the world that's not the goal here the goal is not to showcase me for me it's about showcasing what's possible you know when you believe and i am in a different place than i've ever been that's all i don't know man gnadi's a great guy he's super strong
SPEAKER_04: I'm just radar muscle. I don't really know. We can talk, and we talk, and we talk, and it's going to be great. It's going to be fun, and we're good friends, and it's a great crime lottery, but November 2nd, something very special is coming. Yeah. Roman, maybe quickly? Summarize, yeah. Yeah, for Genadi, so yeah, he will understand. Yeah, for sure. Genadi, I think you need some day. How old is it? What's your job? Mike, Marat, Claro.
SPEAKER_02: It is very important to know that you are not the only one in this form, you are not the only one in this form, you are not the only one in this form, you are not the only one in this form, you are not the only one in this form, you are not the only one in this form,
SPEAKER_02: In my opinion, this is a very important point, that if you want to do something, for example, if you want to do something and you don't want to do it for the sake of Genadi, and you don't want to do it for the sake of Jerry, or for the sake of Jerry, or for the sake of Jerry, or for the sake of Jerry, or for the sake of Jerry, or for the sake of Jerry,
SPEAKER_00: And that's why I think Michael is the one who is responsible for what he did and how he did it. That's right, that's right. He was responsible for what he did and how he did it. And that's why I think Michael is the one who is responsible for what he did and how he did it. And that's why I think Michael is the one who is responsible for what he did and how he did it. And that's why I think Michael is the one who is responsible for what he did
SPEAKER_00: If you ask me what is possible, I would say that it is possible for Lebanon to win the war. I would say that it is possible for Lebanon to win the war. But what happens is that in the end, I agree with you. Then, if for the first time in the world, Lebanon will win the war, I will not have a problem.
SPEAKER_02: mike i'm i'm so excited to hear that about you and how about that you are so confident and so um satisfied uh the way your training is going on um i wish the same uh for every athlete and that's supposed to be that way such a level of confidence against whoever is the opponent um so my point is that even if i was in your place i would
SPEAKER_02: I think the same way as well. If somebody throws Lewandowski, let's say, number one guy who is in the world out,
SPEAKER_02: take on that i would not back off and i would just do the job the way i can do the best so props to you uh full respect i respect the commitment that you have given to this match and um trust me uh the um this hypothetical uh thinking that came to you that i may not show up or
SPEAKER_03: somehow cancel the match. That's not going to happen. And I'll give you the full pleasure of our match. Levan Terzi says, Michael, do you think this match is a modern day Gimli versus Gandalf? Michael, you are Georgii kryptonite. You will beat Genadi and then Levan easily, he says.
SPEAKER_03: And then Mr. W, thank you for your support. And Mr. W, Michael will win, he says. Sorry. Greetings and best wishes from Germany. Sebastian, rooting for you, Mike. Big Devon and Michael fan here. All the best, Engin. And I think these are the superchats, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: For me, this match is the most exciting match. I will be waiting for this match to come to the stage. That will be the most special moment. It's not a title match. Do you know how I see this, Roma? I see two volcanoes.
SPEAKER_03: And ready to... About to erupt. Yeah, ready. I know how much they're holding them. I know Michael is just barely holding himself to not to talk too much. He talks right now because he is invited to the podcast, but he doesn't want to talk. He just want to do it. That is how I see Michael. Am I wrong? You're right. Yeah. So I know how much you're holding inside. And I know the potential of Genadi at the table that he pushes everything. I just can't wait you guys to...
SPEAKER_03: clash and I just do not know but no matter who stands at the end like I don't really care like like there is no losing guy in this competition like I know it's gonna be a war and when two warriors true warriors they fight I mean one win one loses there is no other way there is no tie in our nothing and I will have huge respect for the outcome you know
SPEAKER_02: Can you also tell this to Genadi so he would understand what we are talking about?
SPEAKER_02: It is very difficult and very difficult to unite in this fight. The fact of the matter is that everyone is ready to fight, there is nothing to be afraid of, but it is very difficult and very difficult to unite in this fight.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know how it will be in the future. I don't know how it will be in the future. I don't know how it will be in the future. I don't know how it will be in the future.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to say that it is of great interest to all of us. I would like to say that this is not just a title, this is a message to all of us. Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: He said, thank you. Thank you for appreciating the match this late. I can see Michael just roaring. And then Genadi is going, oh, Pana, oh, Pana. Can you imagine that moment at the stage? Wow. I know Michael is just fully loaded, fully loaded, you know, for years of passion, you know, because like he has been like since the 2022, he pulled Genadi since then.
SPEAKER_03: For a moment, it seemed like Michael, you were off the target, you understand? And now you're on track again. Can you concentrate on Genadi fully at this moment? Are you totally concentrated and focused without being distracted?
SPEAKER_04: from the next steps like to know the next steps is it good motivation for you or is it a distraction for you both i mean it's good motivation but it's also can be a distraction um because you you want to see yourself at that final stage you know
SPEAKER_04: the ultimate goal in mind right but i understand but not 12 days before the match right not 12 days before the match you don't know what i mean i'm not i'm a fan like i'm a fan of gnadi like if he wasn't arm wrestling me i'd be cheering for gnadi probably you know what i mean um it's just like i said but it's just different it's just different this time yeah
SPEAKER_03: So this, this time, this time, do you want to already apologize him in advance for the outcome? No, man, I, I got a lot of respect for Genadi. So it's going to be a good day. It's going to be a good day. Okay. So better not talk so much. So let's, let's just focus on the November. I, I just, um, maybe you, you translate Roman.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to say that this is a very important issue, because we all know that it is not easy to find a job, and it is not easy to find a job that is suitable for you. It is not easy to find a job that suits your needs. I would like to say that this is a very important issue, because it is one of the things that I would like to say to you, and I would like to express my gratitude to you.
SPEAKER_00: Numeferi, Michael, Numeferi, Numeferi, because I was with you, I was with you and this Numeferi and something else, well, I don't want to say anything, you know, this is the kind of person I am, that I was with you and Numeferi, I was with you, I was with you and I was with you, I was with you, I was with you, I was with you.
SPEAKER_02: Mike, stop being so soft towards to me. I know this may be your strategy to somehow soften up and make me respect you so much that I lose the match against you. I'm coming there for your destruction. I meant that and I'm going to execute it. So just do whatever you need to do and just stop being so soft and somehow try to fire up the match. It was a pleasure to talk to you, Michael.
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to say that we are only talking about whether it is true or not, and I don't want to argue with Magida. That's the way it is, and I don't want to argue with anyone. I'm going to be honest with you. From the beginning, from the beginning and from the beginning to the end, from the beginning to the end, I'm going to be honest with you, Magida is not serious about what she's going to do, and it's possible that she's not going to do anything about it. There's no chance.
SPEAKER_02: Even obviously after our match is done, I will come to you and we can shake hands, hug, drink some beer and we're still going to be friends like we are already. However, even if Lewon is against me, no matter how much I appreciate him, I will not go easy on him anyway. So at the table.
SPEAKER_02: I've been missing the sensation. I've been missing this feel, the urge to pull more than a year and seven months. And I'm coming there so hyped. I'm coming there so much prepared that I will not let anything stop me from the victory. Tell me something. Just make me angry. Being so friendly from the distance, that strategy is not working.
SPEAKER_03: I'm getting sleepy. Roman, Michael said that he prefers not to hear that Opana from Genadi. What does Genadi think about this? I've heard that one too.
SPEAKER_02: Once we are set, right before Neil Pickup will announce us,
SPEAKER_04: I will start saying Opana right there. If you were announced first, I would be chasing you and screaming Opana. All right. There you go. Yeah. You're definitely going to hear Opana. I have no doubt that I will hear it, but my objective is to keep him from being in a position where he believes it.
SPEAKER_04: I have to keep him subdued, right? I have to win in such a fashion that he never gets that confidence. He's going to come out confident. He's going to be confident when he comes out. I cannot say he's going to be too confident after round one. Thank you. Thank you. That helped me to translate that one. Roman, do you understand, right? He knows. Michael doesn't say that...
SPEAKER_03: is bothered by him saying opana but michael is trying to make sure that the opana is not gonna come in the right time with confidence because michael will never give him that the confidence is just gonna dominate him or something you know is that correct michael that's a pretty good interpretation
SPEAKER_02: Well, Genadi, it is possible to say that you are right, and I am not saying that you are wrong, but I would like to say that my opinion is that when you look at the world, one thing is that you are right, and the other thing is that you are wrong. I don't want to say that you are right, that you are wrong,
SPEAKER_00: and they don't want to get married. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
SPEAKER_00: If you don't know how to do it, you don't know how to do it, you don't know how to do it, you don't know how to do it, you don't know how to do it, you don't know how to do it, you don't know how to do it, you don't know how to do it, you don't know how to do it, you don't know how to do it,
SPEAKER_02: Guys, guys, we need to know exactly the power of Opana. When I'm saying Opana, for instance, right now, even I'm getting already somehow fired up to pull even right now. But the point is, when I say Opana during the match, it's not like I'm just saying this for the sake of the word itself. Somehow it's like word comes to me and it's just like coming from the inner confidence.
SPEAKER_02: And if I say and whenever I say it, then it really will mean that I'm going to show up like five Genadi at the same time. But little advice for Mike, if Mike wants me not to say Opana or not to hear it coming from me as I'm getting fired up.
SPEAKER_02: I would suggest that you, Mike, to just when they announce your name, just walk on the stage without you being motivating yourself because I have seen you doing that. And once you do that, that will fire me up. So if you don't want to hear Opana, even from the beginning, just walk calmly, just like just a random regular dude, just walk to your side of the table. And that will prevent me to get in the mood to even let Opana come out of me.
SPEAKER_00: Well, that is interesting.
SPEAKER_02: So point is like as long as you are silent, as long as you are not making any noise, even sometimes you do the big foot like you are making noise with your feet going out at the stage. Even if I hear that noise, it will
SPEAKER_02: It will make me angry. So just walk in there silently, smile on your face. And if you look at me smiling, I will be kind of softened up. But if you try to do something that may cause any type of noise, even with your feet or your facial expression that is not smiling, I'm definitely going to get angry. And then Opana will arrive. Yeah, but why would Genadi give this suggestion to Michael? He doesn't want to be at his best?
SPEAKER_00: Well, Genadi, you know, it's a bit of a coincidence, but I don't think it's going to happen, because if it does, it's going to be a big deal. No, I don't think it's going to happen. It's going to be a big deal. It's going to be a big deal. Even if it doesn't happen with a 10% chance, it's still going to be a big deal. But you know what? It's going to be a big deal.
SPEAKER_00: If he was a great player, he would have been a great player, he would have been a great player, he would have been a great player, he would have been a great player, he would have been a great player, he would have been a great player, he would have been a great player, he would have been a great player, he would have been a great player, he would have been a great player, he would have been a great player, he would have been a great player,
SPEAKER_02: The key is that, yeah, for sure, I'm giving you this advice because I will then not commit 100% during the table and I will let us just to fight and do some showmanship, you know. But unfortunately, I cannot control it throughout the match. That will only happen in one round, first round.
SPEAKER_02: and unfortunately i i cannot control how much power uh michael will possess so if i feel uh that uh there's enough power coming from michael then my opana will come he presses the opana button turbo button
SPEAKER_00: For instance, me versus Dave Chaffee in the match, in the third round, in the third round, Opana kicked in. That's how Opana kicked in.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because he explained about the Dave Chaffee match. He said, Dave is such a chill dude, such a noiseless guy, such a quiet piece of phenomenon. He's just, I didn't even realize that I was having a match up until I felt some power and felt some rage in the third match. So that's the key. If my opponent is just calm and doing nothing to anger me, Opana is also calm.
SPEAKER_03: i think it has nothing to do with opana he basically had no other chance and he said okay let me go inside and that is how that happened this is my my guest but mr w michael how important is it for you that devon supports you that devon's of course it's nice to be supported i've got a lot of support this this go around this comeback it's funny how people have kind of switched from
SPEAKER_04: You know, it's a joke. It's a joke. I should retire too. Oh my God, Michael is really serious. Having Devon support does help. So yeah, that's nice. I appreciate that. Regarding how I should come out, I fully expect to come out calm, relaxed. I have no pressure in this match. I have zero pressure.
SPEAKER_04: Because I've done the work. You know what I'm saying? I've done the work. And if I'm really on a mission from God, if I genuinely believe I'm doing this so that God is working through me to show people what's possible through Christ, I have nothing to prove. I have no arrogance about it. I have no bravado. I'm going to come on November 2nd. I'm going to walk out on the stage. I'm going to say a prayer. I'm going to kiss my wife. When he comes out, I'm going to shake his hand. And I'm winning 3-0. I'm going to shake his hand again, and I'm back to work.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Michael, that's what I wanted to hear from you. Yeah. . You mean 3-0 during the eating competition, right? That's what you mean 3-0, like eat off. Whatever it takes, baby, whatever it takes.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I mean even...
SPEAKER_02: sorry uh even even when it comes to eating challenge and drinking challenge georgians uh gonna be your limited for sure because we are eating so much you can tell and also drink as well uh but now actually i know i know exactly what you mean mike i think you meant uh the jumping at the table right from the go you are good i think you're gonna beat me of the long distance jump
SPEAKER_04: So here's the deal. He thinks he's going to win. I think I'm going to win. Great podcast. Who does he think has the best chance of Levan? Who does he think has the best chance of Levan in the next six months? The next six months. Again, I think it's going to be Marta. We, we, we, we, we, we, we,
SPEAKER_00: Mike, why do you keep...
SPEAKER_02: uh keep telling such a um easy questions when you already know the answer obviously i'm gonna have more chance to beat lebanon in six months like if you are talking about if you let's be honest right here if you're talking about uh long distance jumps i already admitted uh you're gonna win three oh against me you you can even definitely beat the one but when it comes to arm wrestling it's me it's the best chance
SPEAKER_04: How old is Genadi now? Is he 39, 40, 38, 39, whatever? 39. Well, I'm 51 years old. How bad is it going to be to get beaten by a 51-year-old guy?
SPEAKER_02: That's got to hurt, right? That's got to sting him. Wow, Michael, that's what I want. That's got to sting, right?
SPEAKER_00: This is the situation we are in now. Michael, the 29th, who was a candidate, if you look at the European Union and the other candidates, the 29th, who was a candidate, is not here. These candidates. In fact, I have no idea when Michael, the 31st, will be elected.
SPEAKER_00: Well, let's pick the facts here. Let's pick the facts here. We said I'm 39 and Mike is 31 years old, right?
SPEAKER_02: Let's say when Mike was 39 and compared to my current achievements, it was for instance, such achievements Mike has not had. Mike did not have at his 39 age, right? So me continuing to these statistics and based on this one coming from my side and my perspective, how confident I feel, there will be no shame
SPEAKER_02: in my mind, beating 50-year-old guys. So he personally said my name. He personally called me out. He personally wants revenge. He personally wants to beat Genadi Kukunia. Not only him, but anybody else, whoever says, I want to beat Genadi Kukunia, welcome in Istanbul. That is versus West Stage. I'm going to beat you all. He's right about 39 in my WEF titles. But at 39, I did beat him. I don't think he ever did that.
SPEAKER_02: uh sorry mike you're saying that you are uh you are saying that you are which can never achieve to do it come here he gave me a platform to come here
SPEAKER_00: In the 19th century, when Pushkar was in power, he had titles. He had titles. He had titles. He had titles. He had titles. He had titles. He had titles. He had titles. He had titles.
SPEAKER_00: The reason is that when I went to commercial events, in fact, I didn't even know that I was going to be in front of a computer with an envelope. That was against my genetic standards and technique. I really didn't want to, in fact, I didn't want to. I had a bag, a bag, a bag, a bag, a bag, a bag, a bag.
SPEAKER_00: And these are the kind of things that I didn't have to worry about, because Klaucidi is there, and these people are responsible for the development of our profession. Klaucidi, you have to do this and do that. Klaucidi, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this.
SPEAKER_00: It doesn't matter to us. First of all, if Arsene Liliev has a weight of 75 kilos, I would weigh him with a weight of 75 kilos and say, how did this man manage to weigh 75 kilos? And there is nothing wrong with that. If you look at it, 75 kilos is his weight, and 75 kilos is a weight of 20 kilos. It doesn't matter. There was no doubt that he was going to lose weight.
SPEAKER_00: In this way, in all sorts of ways, we would have been able to make a lot of money, make a lot of money, make a lot of money, make a lot of money, make a lot of money, make a lot of money, make a lot of money, make a lot of money, make a lot of money, make a lot of money, make a lot of money, make a lot of money, make a lot of money, make a lot of money,
SPEAKER_02: Mike, you are already causing excitement in my mind and in my heart. So keep on doing that. That pressure, I love it. Well, yeah, about Pushkar, he has never been in my weight class. He was one class above. I was at 110 and he was open. That way, I never even get the chance to face him. However... Talking about what, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah uh because back then uh because yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yes uh i would ask about that one but later let me finish uh his uh um translation so he said uh
SPEAKER_02: Even those times when we were kind of trying to achieve our titles at the WAF, back then we did not even know that much about armor sling and we started to learn slowly and slowly at the time when, for instance, we didn't know that we have to pull and lift heavy.
SPEAKER_02: like when i first time saw arsene william curling seven times 55 kg i was like stunned i could only do like 30 kg at once back then but uh then i started to
SPEAKER_02: because I was so stunned. How can a human being do such a thing? I couldn't even imagine it. It broke my mind. And then I started to train me, Vasili, Rezo, Levan, everybody was stunned. He just repeated the same thing. Everybody was stunned when we saw Arsene. And then we started to do the same, started to outlift him. And I even have called ATKG, which is already on the...
SPEAKER_02: internet. So
SPEAKER_02: My point is that we are getting better and better as we grow into this sport. And lately, the super heavyweight styles that East vs West is offering us, we are reaching our potential maximum and we are showcasing how much we can do. So when it comes to comparing the shapes, I will keep progressing and I will show
SPEAKER_00: absolute strength that i can do so yeah if you want me i can i can ask him
SPEAKER_00: All of them. In the past, they would go to Africa and stay there for 4-5 hours. In fact, they would go there once a week, sometimes twice a week, and sometimes three times a week. That's what we've been doing for a long time. The Georgii, when they came to us, they said, look, Museljani, you're going to be united with the Germans. And this is what we're afraid of, that the Germans won't be able to do it. They won't be able to do it, they won't be able to do it, they won't be able to do it, they won't be able to do it.
SPEAKER_00: This is the problem. But if you look at the situation on the Internet, you will see that there are problems. If you look at the situation on the Internet, you will see that there are problems. If you look at the situation on the Internet, you will see that there are problems. If you look at the situation on the Internet, you will see that there are problems. If you look at the situation on the Internet, you will see that there are problems. If you look at the situation on the Internet, you will see that there are problems. If you look at the situation on the Internet, you will see that there are problems. If you look at the situation on the Internet, you will see that there are problems. If you look at the situation on the Internet, you will see that there are problems. If you look at the situation on the Internet, you will see that there are problems.
SPEAKER_02: Throughout our history, Georgii Armour Sling back then was based on the technicality. We were taught not to...
SPEAKER_02: Sorry, guys. Can you hear me, guys? Yeah, we can hear you just off video. Yeah, I will continue to translate. Sorry about that. So back in those times, we were taught not to pull heavy and Georgii armwrestling was all about the technicality and whatever we could do with our power. But lately, when Internet came in and we saw all these sensational lifts and stuff like this, we realized that we need to lift heavy as well.
SPEAKER_02: And back in those days, we would also train entire body. We were just basically stagnating and we were not armwrestling focused that much as we are doing now. So now all the knowledge of technicality combined with the strength that is specifically towards to armwrestling and related to armwrestling moves and lifting heavier and heavier drew our level of armwrestling in higher levels.
SPEAKER_04: It's obvious that Georgii are amazing. Real quick, because I'm going to have to go here in a minute. We got more questions if Inge wants some. But can we ask, is this the best Genadi that has ever existed? Or is he just getting close back to his best? I mean, who am I facing on November 2nd? Is the best Genadi ever? Is it 75% of Genadi? What do we got? Genadi, I would like to ask you, what do you think about this version of Genadi?
SPEAKER_00: Is this the form of the Soviet Union or is it the new form of the Soviet Union? The new form of the Soviet Union has been fixed with me since the beginning. I was born and raised here. I was born and raised here. I was born and raised here. I was born and raised here. I was born and raised here.
SPEAKER_00: Because there are many people like that and they don't want to be in that form. I'm the only one who thinks that I'm going to go to hell, but the fact is that I'm going to go to hell and I'm going to have a lot of problems with me and I'm going to have a lot of problems with me. I had a lot of problems with me and I had a lot of problems with me and I had a lot of problems with me and I had a lot of problems with me and I had a lot of problems with me.
SPEAKER_00: I would also like to point out that I know that I will have a certain period of time when I will be able to make these changes in my current form. As I said before, these changes are not necessary, because I know that I will be able to make at least 50% of the changes that I will be able to make in my current form. But when I was in my current form,
SPEAKER_00: It's not a lie, Michael Todd, I was talking to Pivdapir Ermez Gasparin, and Pivdapir Ermez Gasparin told me that I could go to Lebanon because I had a claim that there was no sport in the world, there was no sport in the world. The claim is that I was born in Lebanon, I was born in Lebanon, I was born in Gasparin, and I don't even know how Gasparin was born.
SPEAKER_00: And it was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do it. It was not even in that form that I was able to do
SPEAKER_00: In my opinion, it is a mistake to go to Michael and tell him that this is the period when it is necessary to go to Michael and tell him that there is no need to go to Michael. If he says no, Michael will have to leave. In my opinion, it is a mistake to go to Michael and tell him that this is the period when it is necessary to go to Michael and tell him that this is the period when it is necessary to go to Michael.
SPEAKER_00: Michael Todd and Erdzgenad Kvikvinia were not able to get Levan Saginashvili. This is a great achievement. But our potential is very high, that someone like Gasparin and Levan will be able to get away from us.
SPEAKER_00: During this period, we have to be careful not to lose weight, because our body is responsible for it, and our health is responsible for it. If we lose weight, we will lose weight, and we will lose weight, and we will lose weight, and we will lose weight, and we will lose weight.
SPEAKER_02: uh-huh so um to be honest and to be to be like completely honest with you mike and answer your question uh unfortunately right now i don't say i would not say that i'm at my best shape my best shape was when i competed against larat and back then i was so confident in my shape that i was in my mind i was for sure ready to pull number one guy which was the one back then and is uh today
SPEAKER_02: uh but right now I would say I'm around 85 I'm there I need still roughly 15 to achieve that shape uh I don't I don't want you to get me wrong Mike I think that uh right now none of us are ready to beat the one there is no way and it would be outrageous to stay stay such a plane uh me myself and you uh but I believe we both have potential to do that in in specific amount of time uh and uh
SPEAKER_02: If it was, I don't want you to take it personally, obviously, if it was me at my best shape and if I was sure that I would be reaching my potential at ESW15, I would already tell Endgame to make me face Hermes so that next match would be a number one title.
SPEAKER_02: But I know that I cannot reach it until this time. This is not enough time period for me. So I'm doing my best. I will be around 85%. I am around 85% of my best. And I think this is good enough to do a good match against you. And me and you both have potential to even surpass our right now current shape to do the worthy match against Luan or whoever will be number one.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, I will read a few questions. I will not ask any prediction. We did already then. Peter Unsure says, question for both of you. Genadi and Michael, how do they think that they will pass Hermes since they both lost against him in the past? I know Michael won. And yeah, the match technically you won. And Genadi, we know there was his comeback match, but
SPEAKER_03: And there is Billy Bob. Genadi, if you were Mexican, would you say opana? Can you ask him like if both questions, how does he think he's going to beat Hermes? And if he was a Mexican, would he say opana? But just please tell him to answer quickly, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Very quickly, and then... Genadi, I want to ask you a question, but I don't know how to answer it. In the context of this, what do you think, how do you see Hermes, how do you see the future of Hermes? And if I may ask, do you think that the Mexican version of Opana is the same as the Mexican version of Opana? No, I don't think so. Opana is very different from what I've heard so far.
SPEAKER_00: The whole society is afraid of the fact that we are going to lose our children.
SPEAKER_00: For example, my mother would probably be very happy to hear that Opana was killed, but why would she want to kill him? This is the source of my energy, that I want to get rid of him and kill him, so that I don't have to go through this situation. But first of all, as Opana said, I don't want to kill him, because with Hermes Gaspar,
SPEAKER_00: You told him to make it short, right? Yes, I told him.
SPEAKER_02: So I will start with his first answer was about the Mexican version of opana. Basically, opana cannot be translated, but what I can say is that opana is like encouraging word and you are encouraging yourself from your inner potential. And about Hermes, I would say
SPEAKER_02: I know that Hermes is versatile athlete versatile opponent and I cannot say for sure this is the way how I would beat Hermes Hermes will adapt during the match so all I can say is the table will show and uh Hermes himself will show me the lanes where I can try to take him down so I can do hook I can do flop you guys know that I can do different things so I will I will do my best
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, another quick answer I want. John Lewis asking, Genadi, who wins between Devon and Brian Shaw? But just name, you know, who wins? Devon is the Brian Shaw. Devon is the Brian Shaw. Devon. Devon. Okay. Henry is asking, Engin, can this match be made four rounds if agreed? Probably not because, like, we have rules and let's go there. And Genadi, Michael, can you beat Eddie Hall's press?
SPEAKER_03: Michael is arm wrestling, press the shoulder press. I don't know the question. I just, I can't out press him, but I, I did see that he had a minor injury doing a 200, a hundred KG dumbbell doing shoulder presses on his tricep. So I don't know, but arm wrestling related, I'm sure Genadi and I would fare very well. Yeah. To Genadi to think that Georgii are unbeatable is foolish. How about the, when the underdog Germany beat Brazil in 2014,
SPEAKER_03: at the World Cup, always remember that. All the best, Sebastian." Can you translate that? It's not a question.
SPEAKER_02: He's asking you mean football, not you, but whoever asked the question. Yeah, he says that Germany was underdog in football and he won, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: In football, we are also progressing. Even though Turkey beat us last time, we are still progressing. We were very close.
SPEAKER_03: it was such a great match yeah yeah it was there actually yeah Michael told Billy Bob is asking we'll go okay not asking Michael Todd will go on undefeated for the rest of his career and that's wrong bursting as the greatest of all time no one's ever gonna dethrone John for being the greatest of all time so I'm not I'm not even trying to do anything like that
SPEAKER_03: yeah and okay i think it's finished okay let me ask one question to gennady and then i ask your last word gennady you said that you are 85 and it will be ready for michael and you said that you both have potential to beat not beat but just be ready for levan and but it is not now what if you do the calculation wrong while you are 85 and michael is already there
SPEAKER_02: What will you think about it since after your injury, this is your comeback match, while this is Michael's fourth match? That is my last question to you. Genadi, I would like to ask you a question that I don't usually ask myself, which is, do you think that Ambopo has a 95% chance of winning, or does it mean that it's not a 95% chance?
SPEAKER_02: But if something happens, it means that you and Michael will have a potential chance of winning. It's like this. What if in that case, the ball is in your hands and the ball is in your hands, it doesn't mean that Le'Juan is going to score. In your opinion, in your opinion, is it possible for Donny's ball to score now? Is it possible for Le'Juan to score? No, no.
SPEAKER_00: How do you think Michael's version of the story is going to be? Michael, it seems that Levan is going to win, because he's going to be a very strong opponent. How do you think he's going to win? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to talk about the fact that I was born in Levan. Levan is a high level city. I'm telling you. Levan is a high level city. I was born in a high level city. I was born there. I was born there. I was born there. I was born there. I was born there. I was born there. I was born there. I was born there.
SPEAKER_00: No disrespect, man. No disrespect.
SPEAKER_02: Those names that you mentioned that we all know that Michael has successfully managed his match against, let's be honest, they are not on Lewand's level. Just beating those guys doesn't mean that right now, the way he beat them, for instance, Jablonski last time,
SPEAKER_02: To me, it doesn't seem that Michael is capable to beat number one guy right now because he should have beaten Jablonski as if we all thought that he broke his arm. But that did not happen. It was like struggling going on there. It was three months ago. Okay, go ahead. Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: Yes. And if, let's say, Michael is showing up against me in the shape that we would think that he's ready to face number one.
SPEAKER_02: Such a Michael must stop me dead set in the center and just stonewall me, just not let me do anything. Because if me and him start to go back and forth and match is not one-sided, there is no way that this level Michael is ready for number one right now. This is my opinion. Okay, but first of all, Kamil's match was three months ago. His first match was in April. From April to August,
SPEAKER_03: it was April 20th. From April 20th to August 10th, there was a little bit more than three and a half months. And now almost one week, at least like, I mean, except one week is three months. So what I'm just saying that the progress from Lamparilli to Kamil and from Kamil to here,
SPEAKER_03: the time is almost the same, like half time, you know, common match. So after that, almost three months passed. And also to stop Genadi at the center, that is not the way of Michael. Michael is right here. It doesn't matter who is he pulling. He is like around here is better if it is Levan or someone else like that. Does he...
SPEAKER_04: Michael, do you want to add anything about his calculation or this is just my opinion? Man, it's all good, bro. I just want to arm wrestle. We're going to see what happens in 12 days. After that, we can start talking about what's next. Safe travels to everyone. Stay healthy. Devon't get injured. Show up really, really strong because I promise you I'm going to show up really, really strong.
SPEAKER_04: It's going to be a great event. Thank you once again, Ingen, for putting together such amazing cards. You're welcome. And I'm excited about the future. So that's what I got. Yeah. Roman, translate again as you take his last word, and let's close. Yeah. All right.
SPEAKER_02: Gera, I'd like to ask Michael a question, and I'd like to ask you the same question. What do you think about the fact that you are in the same group of people? Do you think that in your opinion,
SPEAKER_02: What do you want to do? What do you want to do? What do you want to do? What do you want to do?
SPEAKER_00: . . . . .
SPEAKER_02: Can you tell him to turn the camera off? Maybe it will be better connection. OK, never mind.
SPEAKER_02: I understood what he said. He was saying that likewise I wish you the successful preparation without any injuries and he also thanked you that you wish that he would deliver his best shape and possibly show up the strongest that he can do. So he was thankful for that and he said that he is wishing you
SPEAKER_02: same and also he also said during this interview you know my character i may have said something that just uh went little uh more aggressively but that's uh that's all good and at the end of the day uh we know uh the respect that we have against each other and uh towards each other so whatever we say against each other in this podcast i think it was necessary to you know just deliver our thoughts so
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Thank you very much, Genadi. Thank you. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Roman. And guys, no, there is no predictions because I did separate already podcast with them and they both share their opinions already about the other matches. Once again, thank you, Michael. Thank you, Roman, for the translation. Thank you, Genadi. See you guys in Istanbul very soon. Take care, guys. Take care, guys. Bye.
