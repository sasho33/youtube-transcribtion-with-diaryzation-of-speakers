SPEAKER_04: You're there? You're freezing. Yeah, I don't see it coming up for me. Are we live right now? Yeah, we're live. I think right now I started. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Do you see? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, good. All right. So I think there is a misunderstanding and I want you to... One second.
SPEAKER_01: Let me turn this off. Yeah, he wanted to do a clarification. So what I read... You asked me and I agreed.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I asked you, do you want to like that one? You want to clarify? You agree? Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, of course. So, okay, so that is, there is a misunderstanding. And I will, I will, I would like you to explain this to community so that that's not what you meant.
SPEAKER_03: Well, no, it is what I meant. It absolutely is what I meant, and I will clarify it so that people can understand it better. But first, I'll ask, where did the video go? What do you mean? Because it's a misunderstanding. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't do that. What do you want? Well, you just took it down. It is because you said that is not what you meant. Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. You want me to put it again?
SPEAKER_01: horse i don't like to censor anything oh yeah okay okay yeah just explain it because that's what's still on my face i don't i don't want i don't want podcasts to be taken down i would i don't want them i can say that even the minutes and uh second and everything they can find it no problem yeah but i don't want i don't want my comments to be deleted
SPEAKER_01: That's not your comment, because you can do the same comment on the live, because you said that's not what you meant. You meant something different. So I just... No, I meant that. I meant what I said, but... No, no, when it was said that the brave people died, you didn't mean that the people who fight for their country.
SPEAKER_03: Well, you're, you're taking an assumption off of what I said. Some people, some people commented as that way. And you said a lot of different ways. Okay. And that's why I wish that, you know, you, you put that video back up that short, because I write in a comment, very detailed.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that is why I want you to do live with you. I want us to you to tell us what you said. OK, so first of all, I'm thankful to have a discussion about bravery anytime anybody wants. I am totally thankful for it. I'll say that bravery for me is probably one of my most sought after qualities for great friendships or
SPEAKER_03: Great people. I see I am so attracted to bravery. I love brave people. I love them. Actually, you know, people think I married Jodi because she's pretty. And I tell her that all the time. But the truth is, I married Jodi because she's brave. She's much, much braver than most people. I love bravery.
SPEAKER_03: some of my best friends are the most brave people that i know okay now i will tell you that bravery when i hear the word bravery and i'm accused of not being brave it it typically touches a nerve on me now i did many tours of combat many tours where i witnessed bravery
SPEAKER_01: To the highest order. So bravery is a good thing, right, Devon? Bravery is a great thing. Okay, bravery is not a thing to eat for idiots that die. So we agree about this subject. So I agree. Right now, whatever you are saying right now, I agree with you. Bravery does not mean doing stupid things. Nobody said that. Well, not fighting for a grip?
SPEAKER_03: no no no john didn't say that john didn't say that well i think that's what he said i think john implied did hold on a second yeah did john imply that i should consider being more brave by not fighting for the grip no that was not about that it was about like you he said that he said that
SPEAKER_01: he said that like you said you give them chance your opponents after you secure the victory and then he said it's not bravery and then what did he say that bravery was
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, no, no. He said that you said after securing the victory, you give your opponent a chance. And he said, it's not bravery. I'm not going there. Who's right? Who's wrong? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I saw the video. I just watched this video this morning. But what I'm just saying, after that, you said the bravery. What's the timestamp? I don't know. Just like. Because I'll find it right now because I remember what he said. I can show you.
SPEAKER_03: What I remember he said was he said that bravery was not fighting in the grip. Bravery was letting your opponent get... No, you said... No, am I wrong? Yeah, you said that... One second, let me find this. You said... Yeah, here. What's the time stamp on it? One second.
SPEAKER_04: One second. Yeah, right here. What's the time? I want to have a fair shake. I felt really bad and guilty if I took advantage of the situation. Obviously, some people don't have that conscious. What's the time stamp? Do you know? One second. The second act.
SPEAKER_04: What's the time? What's the time? I'm making you listen to the subject. Just listen. And I do that with almost everybody I face. Once I secure victory, I let them feel like they're carrying on. That's not being brave. I don't care about being brave. I care about winning. Brave is for fucking idiots.
SPEAKER_01: brave is for stupid people right so what happened before that and john is describing his grave what was john describing john wasn't describing the brave john talked about the brave after you said that you you
SPEAKER_03: allow your opponent to give chance after you secure the victory and the only word that he used John was describing bravery as no John I'm gonna I'm gonna re-watch this again because the way the way I remember it is John was saying that I should be more brave by allowing my opponents uh no the the only word that John is using brave you said that you after you secure the victory
SPEAKER_01: you allow your opponent to do something and he said it's not brave and then you say brave are stupid people stupid people die or something like that but you are saying that that's not what you meant that that is the reason that i wanted to have you know i at this point i'd like to review because the way that i remember it in my mind is john was implying to me that
SPEAKER_01: that not take why i don't challenge myself and give people a more fair grip in the set and that was being brave that's what i remember the the brave the brave that you responded was against the moment that he said the brave like is not brave that you take it like you secure the victory and then you give them chance that that was the part and you responded this but this is not what you are saying this is what i understand
SPEAKER_03: So what I was responding to, what I was responding to was the implication that John was suggesting that bravery is allowing your opponent to get a good grip in the setup. And I'll have to rewatch like a good 10 minutes before, because there was an escalation to that point. And while it may seem that I am responding to the immediate couple sentences that followed, I believe I was responding to.
SPEAKER_03: uh john's implication that not fighting in the setup in somehow was brave yeah yeah but what i'm just saying that the word that he used brave was after you said well i think that he was already painting a picture about how um bravery and cheating he never used that word that the word was about that that is not my point what the cheating the bravery
SPEAKER_01: No, no. My point is that, listen, if you listen a little bit, I will tell you. My point is that you are the biggest superstar of arm wrestling. And whenever you said the bravery is for the stupid people. And so I think that after I saw your comments, I said, I thought that you, that is not what people understood from what you said.
SPEAKER_01: So what I'm just saying that I'm not here to argue with you. Maybe it would be better if you explain that that is not what you meant that some people, including myself, understood. Right. So I think that I summarized it quite well in the comment that I put on the video that was taken down. Yeah, but I think it would be better like this if you just talk because a lot of people you watch this way. Right. So in that case,
SPEAKER_03: We're starting from a somewhat flawed entry into the discussion because perhaps what I reacted to was that the complete subject, not, not the last word that John said, because he was implying that you should. Okay. I understand. Okay. You explained to us. Yeah. So as I said, bravery is, is super important. Great bravery is about.
SPEAKER_03: stepping forward and fighting, stepping forward, being selfless. Bravery can mean many things. Bravery is a, is a broad term. It's typically thought of as a virtue as virtuous. Um, now bravery is so important for, for anyone who wants to achieve anything great. You must be brave. You must be brave. Bravery has a line.
SPEAKER_03: Bravery has a line which steps into foolhardiness, right? You can be brave to a point, and then once you cross that point, it can be considered foolhardy. Now, yes, sometimes being foolhardy pays off in an incredible way, but more often than not, foolhardiness results in death or loss of yourself or the people around you.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, bravery is an incredible quality. But to to somehow lean on bravery, when an actual fact, you're being stupid or not understanding the conflict properly. This is an abuse of the word bravery. Okay, but this is not the bravery the word means, right? You are saying bravery means many great things. And what I did
SPEAKER_03: is I took the definition, which was, I believe was being described as brave. What John was describing as brave to me is not bravery. It's either stupidity or foolhardiness. And that's why I said what I did. Okay. One second. So you did not really call the word bravery that way, but you, you were disagreeing with John, what he says to be described bravery. Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, that is the clarification I wanted to hear from you.
SPEAKER_01: Because you are one of those guys that I believe very brave. I will explain to you. We have many disagreements. I'm behind my point of view. You are behind yours as well. It doesn't change the fact that we can still talk. But about bravery, I remember you said that you couldn't come to the
SPEAKER_01: uh prudnik match because of the surgery or the island and then you were ready to get in the plane from friday and arrive there saturday and then in the evening to pull evgeny you remember that so that that that was the time that i i said like you're very very brave person because i don't think anyone would go to the 115 kilo world title match in such case you understand like
SPEAKER_01: You get in plane Friday. We talked about it. I said this personally to you. And then you arrived there Saturday and in the evening, you wanted to pull Rudnick. It didn't turn out that way, but you were planning to do that. So that is why I said that like you, that the way that by the heat of the conversation, the way that it went, I understood that you were defensive by what John was implying.
SPEAKER_01: And then at that moment, when you said like bravery that way, a lot of people misunderstood. And I really don't think that that is what you meant. And right now you explained that that's not what you meant. You respect the bravery and that's clear. I love bravery. Bravery is probably one of the qualities that I love above all other qualities. It's probably one of my very favorite. But please do not mask it.
SPEAKER_03: on under the, the, the guys of stupidity or foolhardiness. Cause they're very different. They're very different. And in no way do I feel that it's brave to not fight for a grip. And that's, and that's really what I was objecting to, um, you know, victory then there there's a slight discussion out there in arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_03: I've heard Todd Hutchings say it. I've heard other people say it's something like excellence over. I don't know. It's some strange quote. Um, but, but, um, I, I have a fundamental deep, deep issue with people who do not value victory. You know, it's about victory. It's about winning, um, that you, you compete in a sport primarily to win.
SPEAKER_03: And then if you can win, you make your win more glorious, but to lose like a martyr to lose so that you can prove something is to me, not brave or not virtuous. You step into the arena primarily to win. And as soon as you somehow take steps away from that, in my mind, it has nothing to do with bravery and to, to.
SPEAKER_01: to imply somehow that what you're doing is brave and it leads you away from victory. I just, I find it offensive. And that's why I said what I did. Okay. Okay. I understand. So that wasn't exactly how you described the bravery, but it is like in the meaning that bravery word was used.
SPEAKER_01: during the conversation, you disagree. That is what you are saying. So you are basically everything, everything you said, you were talking about for the people who are not trying to take advantage or take good grip during the setup. And you are saying that those are the people that should not be doing this and they should be fighting for their grip if they don't do it. Those are the people you call idiots, but not the general meaning of bravery. I certainly,
SPEAKER_03: do not want to attack the virtue of bravery this is not what i intend to do the contextual quote if you were to take the contextual quote uh bravery is for stupid people and just have that as a sentence um this is this is not what i meant this is not what i meant what what i meant was
SPEAKER_03: there is a line that's somehow being drawn in the discussion, particularly between John and I, when it comes to our, uh, procedures for, for arm wrestling. And, and when it comes to the word bravery, somehow there is a line in the setup where, um, John and, and he's lying about it. Um,
SPEAKER_03: Says that if you don't fight for your grip, this is somehow brave. And I'm saying you must fight for your grip and this is brave. So we're saying he's saying brave is not to fight. And I'm saying brave is to fight. And I'm also saying that John is lying about what he's saying. Cause I know that John thinks the same way that I do, but somehow he's misrepresenting the truth, whether it's just to poke at me.
SPEAKER_03: Or maybe to stir up excitement, or maybe to have another match with me, or maybe worst case scenario, he's trying to degrade me and devalue me, which I wouldn't appreciate. Is there any possibility that he really believes? No. What he says, no? I don't think so. Okay. Do you? I don't know. Okay, well, do you think that John Brzenk doesn't fight for the best grip in the setup?
SPEAKER_01: No, everyone fights for the grip. Of course. Everyone fights for the grip, yeah. Right. But does he mean that one? Does he say that you are fighting for the grip? Like that one. Let's talk this. Do you also respect people who doesn't think as you do about this subject? I respect people of all viewpoints and all political and all religion. I respect people for their viewpoints. I do not know everything.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, about this subject, about this subject. Like, people, like, like, you, you are, I see that you are addressing me, you know, you went to the NILS program yesterday and you are saying the organizer, you don't even mention my name and you don't, the organizer is saying this organizer would foul me more than the East versus West.
SPEAKER_01: referees just but do you also know that like like as an organizer like like people also atlas also complained to me the i think the only mistake i made just to by trusting that like we are just like talking and like i it was not the subject it was robert baxter we were going to talk about the future i don't even know how the subject came there but like like they also cheated
SPEAKER_01: No, no, but, but do you also, it was just like, like, like anyway, so I'm fine with it. Believe me, I'm fine. I enjoyed the podcast. Yes. Sometimes, sometimes you live and laugh about it. Like one time when you come yellow or you said, oh, everybody knows that I cheat or something. I, you, I, I remember times that you took, but I think when it comes from John, it, it, it hurts you more probably.
SPEAKER_01: or like what do you think that do you think that like as an organizer like when athletes are looking at me like because just don't blame me for that the athletes also tell me when they blame me like you allow devon because he's most popular type of thing like i feel like i feel bad you understand that's true is it true engen
SPEAKER_01: no i would i would i allow such thing but you also know that you also why don't you tell them that why don't you why don't you then say i don't i don't i don't i don't say of course i tell them that they know also but but they they they never they imply that way and like i i feel like kind of you feel like do you feel okay okay i hear you do you feel that they're right
SPEAKER_01: you want to hear my opinion. Like, I kind of feel like you get a bit higher on the webbing. Like, this is like, if you ask me that, you understand? And like, I also told you privately that, like, before the go, I think you already, like... What are the precise rules of arm wrestling that I'm breaking, and why haven't I been fouled out? I mean, like, the truth is, I just watched it. In fact, after that, I mean, I can...
SPEAKER_01: I can say that. Yeah. I mean, uh, that is not that bad, but, but, but just like, but I listened to this from the athletes. Do you believe that when the athletes come to you, Georgii or Ermias Ford, let's, let's talk about who do you want to talk about first? Georgii or Ermias? Do you want to, do you want to hear my opinion? You want to hear my opinion? In my opinion, no matter how those matches started, you would have won.
SPEAKER_01: Let's, let's, let's go into detail. I told you. This is very important. Yeah. Okay. You said athletes came to you and complained. Yeah, they do. Yeah. Okay. I told them, I told them this was not only because of that. You lost. Okay. I said, I said, I was stronger than you. That, that is why I said, and they said, yes, he was stronger, but still this, this shouldn't happen. This, this is what, which, which, which athlete would you like to speak about?
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it doesn't matter for me. I'm not going to tell you everything they say, but just... Okay, but I'm going to ask you. I'm going to ask you. Do you believe that the referees did a poor job? I mean, I kind of feel like... Today, I talked with one of those athletes, and he said that before he pulled you, he talked with the referee to apply the rules strictly, and...
SPEAKER_01: The referee was just, yeah, but he's like very famous, you understand? Okay, wait a second. Which athlete are we talking about? I better not, you understand? I think you're wrong. Why are we not transparent? If you want to talk about a subject and you want to work through it, look, I can address them one by one. I can address each match. I think we are going to sit here. When you come, the athlete will be here. But what I just tried to say, just one second. Okay, so is it Ermias? Is it Ermias?
SPEAKER_01: Referee doesn't cheat. Referee is probably intimidated. And you can say that that is his fault, intimidated. Referee has all good intentions. If I know one referee who has any intention to do wrong, I would never work with that referee at all. Those referees I trust 100%. But I think that they are intimidated when they are applying.
SPEAKER_03: the rule that this is what I understood. I'm not trying to argue with you. So first let's, because I actually want to break it down to like actual facts and actually what happened. So, so I'm, I'm just going to assume that you're talking about Hermes, right? Because you've already said the name Hermes and you already said he's coming. Okay. You said Prudnik, Georgii and, um, uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So let's talk about Hermes.
SPEAKER_01: okay what happened in the first round okay what just you tell me what happened okay so who was cheating i mean you you want me to say somebody won that first round i think you won on fouls or what was it how was it yeah i won on fouls yeah yeah and he got the house yeah
SPEAKER_03: yeah he fouled out getting foul is just not cheating okay all right the referee stepped in because his behavior was out of the rule set yeah right yeah yeah but he doesn't have a complaint i don't think he was trying to catch you okay so so he fouled out the first round and he's accusing me of cheating listen people who fouls
SPEAKER_01: I'm not saying that the people who fouls are cheating. You understand? The elbow may get out, this and this. As long as the foul is called, I'm just saying that when the referee calls you something,
SPEAKER_01: You don't say that, yes, you are the best referee, as you mentioned on the Neil program, and you are right to call me foul. But you like, like, for example, when you get a foul on the shoulder on the Levan match first round, you were not happy. You didn't say that you are the best referee. You found me. So I was cheating. So that is not cheating. What I'm just saying that like,
SPEAKER_01: In my opinion, referees should be more strict about applying the rules. And athletes should be more respecting the referee. Because I'm telling you, I was curious. I talked with Robert after the podcast. And Robert told me that you told him, of course, I know that Engin would never cheat or something, anything. You told him that this was Robert's. And that's true. I would never do that, any cheating.
SPEAKER_01: But I'm just saying that from my perspective, I'm telling you, you to win a match from the business perspective is better for any organization. But I need to, as an organizer, I need to make sure that everything needs to be square. I know whenever I say that you are saying that if you were not
SPEAKER_03: square if you are not i i just think that they are maybe maybe you are right maybe maybe referee should not be intimidated but do you do you not agree that like referees are not intimidated at all i mean i feel that i feel i feel that if i go to some tournament local where there's maybe i could intimidate a referee but to imply that i'm intimidating the absolute very best
SPEAKER_03: most qualified, most professional, um, referees in the most respected leagues and arm wrestling is disrespectful. Like to, to insinuate that your referees are biased towards me or the King or Bill Collins, or for the last couple of years, I've only competed a King of the table or East versus West or arm wars.
SPEAKER_01: Listen, when you say biased, that's not what I mean. Well, you're saying intimidated by me, so that would imply bias. Maybe they are, I don't know, I don't know how to explain. Maybe they are having a hard time to correct you. I don't know why. Maybe it's because I am also pretty well aware of what the rules are.
SPEAKER_03: I know the rules of arm wrestling as well. And, and I actually, the truth is your opponents are jealous of you that they all think that like they were treated unfairly, you know, or what was it? I think what's the answer? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look it. And that's what I made a video last night. And again, I don't think that I have ever been cheated every single arm wrestling match that I've ever lost. It's never because I was cheated.
SPEAKER_03: It's because I was beaten. There was referees on both sides. Nobody's ever cheated me. I've been beaten.
SPEAKER_03: You know, and so as soon as these people start to believe that the reason why they lost is they were cheated. It makes them mentally weak. I'll go through all three. Look at the truth is with the armies match, when it comes to the refereeing of that, um, in no way, in no way was I, what I don't think I received. I don't think I don't remember receiving. I might've received one foul in the first round or a warning.
SPEAKER_03: But he fouled out the first round. And then after that, you know, the final round, I pinned him and he complained so hard that he wasn't ready that I had to do it again. Okay. In no way, I can't find a time in that match. And I, and please, like, I have so many people who love me and take care of me, make incredible edits to the haters. Please show where the referees cheated my opponent. Please find it.
SPEAKER_01: Because I feel like I want, I feel like my victory. No, no, no, no, no, nobody, nobody, nobody says that. Like I'm telling you, Hermes does. Hermes said it to you. No, no. Hermes doesn't think that, Hermes doesn't think that he was fair, but Hermes believes that on that day you were better anyways. Okay. So why did he say he was cheated? Because he didn't like, he didn't think that the, the webbing or something was like equal and he, he, but, but he thinks that you were stronger and you didn't need that. That's what he.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so let's talk about Genadi. No, not Genadi. Genadi's a mess, and I don't think Genadi thinks I cheated, and he won. And I don't think Genadi cheated. And a lot of people will think that I think Genadi cheated, but I actually don't. I think Genadi beat me fair and square. Yes, there was a poor call in round one. It doesn't matter. In the end, Genadi won when it mattered. He was the better arm wrestler. You said Prudnik.
SPEAKER_01: Like, do you believe that there was a mistake with the Genadi match foul? Yes. And do you think that, like, there was a mistake, like, you know the rules, that the shoulder, who matters being down angle, called late on the Brutnik match in the round one?
SPEAKER_03: um yeah maybe i dipped below i think if i were to look at it again i think that probably that foul that i received probably could have been called like maybe three seconds earlier or four seconds early for me like 10 seconds earlier but okay my opinion and yeah i'd have to look at it again at the elbow
SPEAKER_01: the camera is coming, showing from your front, not from the side. So I like the, from the front side, it is hard to see backside, but like looking from the side, your side. And, and I don't really know. I can't really see it. You cannot see from the front. There's no foul. There's no foul. And there's a visible foul on him.
SPEAKER_03: There was a visible, but they made me say that it's not position gain. I know. I understand and I'm fine with that. It would be better for you that it might continue because you were in a winning position. Absolutely. I'm fine with the no call. I don't care about the no call. What I do care about is the call on me that didn't happen. But honestly, look, I actually don't have a problem with that referee.
SPEAKER_03: I actually really liked that referee and I think he's fair. I think he just made a mistake and I don't hold it. Yeah. I'd be comfortable if he were to ref my match again, because I understand that people are human and people make mistakes, but I do believe, I do believe it was a bad call, but it, but I also, I want to make it perfectly clear that in round five, Genadi was too much for me and he beat me.
SPEAKER_03: And so, so I don't, I I'm not upset about it. I don't feel that I was cheated. I feel that I was beaten. Um, and I think that every time an athlete is like, oh, I was cheated. I mean, for, for, for Prudnik. From your side, this is how you feel. Um, I think that they were beaten, beaten in a game that we chose to play.
SPEAKER_03: You know, it's outsmarted, whatever, whatever you want to say. I don't necessarily believe that there were one thing or another, but I believe that I had victory that day over Prudnik. And I believe that if you really want to take a fine tooth comb and look at the match, I think that from a non-biased perspective, when you understand what a referee's grip is, you will see that that match went into chaos very, very quickly. Pretty much. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: round the first time when we as soon as the referee's grip was called fouls were not called and it wasn't on me there should have been multiple fouls called on Genadi for movement in the referee's grip they were not Prudnik match or Genadi match which one are you talking about right now Prudnik oh Prudnik because you said Genadi now okay yeah oh sorry my mistake my mistake I meant I meant I meant Prudnik
SPEAKER_03: In the first round, when we went to the referee's grip, I realized that the set grip is not the set grip that I was used to, which is fine. I don't mind. Right. Okay. So I was shocked because what I was expecting was a WAF refs grip.
SPEAKER_03: And that's the way it was described to me in the rule set. And when I got onto the table, I was shocked to find out that this was not at all what I was in for. And that's fine. I don't mind. I don't mind that style of a referee's grip. I'm comfortable with it, but we, we cannot pretend like I was the one who initiated all this movement. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So if somebody wants to go back and really look the first time we come together in the referee's grip and see who is lifting their elbows, see who is moving. This is, this match got out of control from a referees and, but, but to put the blame on me, you know, it's. I just think that what we are rewarding here is a loser's mindset. Okay. There are two great referees. These are the best referees that we have.
SPEAKER_03: We both are operating under the same rule system. I do not like the insinuation that referees have been intimidated by me. I think that this is, I think I'm vocal like many athletes present and in the past have been. And I think that you have the right to do that as an athlete. You are allowed to speak. You are allowed to negotiate. You are allowed to fight and to in any way diminish that.
SPEAKER_03: I believe may stifle the sport and bring us more to a WAF style where people are not allowed to speak, not allowed to move, get fouled out for micro adjustments in the setup. This is not going to be where we want to go. No, we don't do that. We don't do this. We are just as flexible as possible, you know. And I remember after the Prudnik match, we said,
SPEAKER_03: don't change the rules rules are very good but i'm fine with it but then when i start to hear things like you are saying that we need to look at you more closely and the athletes are speaking to me and i'm gonna have to look at you more closely i'm like no no listen listen it's not only i'm telling you listen if i look at your match you are like this and petrenko is doing this or you are like this petrenko is getting higher than you
SPEAKER_01: Petrenko is gonna get, you know, in trouble. Like, I talk trouble, like warning or whatever it is. That is not about you. Like, I think that, as I said, I made a mistake. But do you know what I thought? What I thought, Devon? I thought that, as I said, like, I didn't even come to the podcast with that mindset.
SPEAKER_01: It was all about, we were going to talk about the future of arm wrestling with Robert Backstrom and John said that, listen, like something about, he said you and him, and then this conversation started. And I don't know how I get involved because I think I'm also a little bit biased about John, I think a little bit. And then I should like, listen, but anyone who has any bad intention, Devon,
SPEAKER_01: would just do something wrong, you understand? I just talk with you, you understand? I just said that, you know, and I think I privately also told you this, that like, I think you told me the same thing. You said, but the Engin hands are at the center.
SPEAKER_03: yeah but the hands are in the center but the the shoulder can't because when even if if if the hands are at the center and and look at but that's not the rule that's not hanging listen listen to me listen to me yeah what what i would love for you to understand is that rules evolve the rules will never be perfect people will poke holes in the rules
SPEAKER_03: The situation will continue to evolve and rules will require minor adjustment. I understand, but we can't do that by the request of athletes because there are many athletes. No, that's fine. That's fine. I'm telling you, I'm telling you that... We can discuss about it. We can discuss about it. Yes, well, let's do that. Let's do that right now because we're talking about something. I've been accused of moving my shoulder before the... I think that we should do with the old, you know, we can talk about this right now, but about the rules.
SPEAKER_01: we can sit down and talk with other athletes too. Because there may be some athletes that are thinking different way about this. Like, I can't say that, John, Engin changed this rule. Okay, John, Devon, Engin changed this rule. Okay, let me do that one too. So I am not also someone who came from jungle. I'm going to be very biased and say that when you do this discussion about creating really, really a good set of rules,
SPEAKER_03: yeah we have so many great people to to to look at and they don't have to be young there are so many very very senior arm wrestlers they can you know guys like bob brown guys like john brzenk guys like you guys like me guys who've been arm wrestling a long time we don't need to canvas the public okay you can you can
SPEAKER_01: But I really believe that if you want to have a discussion, start with a discussion, have the discussion with the people who knows are missing.
SPEAKER_01: But I'm just saying that, like, to me, for the amateur armwrestling, yeah, the way that, like, whenever I talk with the WAF, like, why this is that little, this small, where is the limit? Like, how we can not do this? So in the WAF, most of the people are doing well because they are used to. And for amateur armwrestling, that is not for entertainment, that's not for pay-per-view.
SPEAKER_01: But what I did was that I used basically the same rules, but with a little bit flexibility, little cows. And they've been fine. And elbows were getting out. One second, elbows were getting out.
SPEAKER_01: I saw Genadi versus Jerry match. Jerry's elbow was getting out from the front. Genadi's elbow was getting out from the back. And I said, like, how am I going to handle this? Some people say that we want to see arm wrestling. But from other side, the people are also complaining why the foul is not called. And I said, okay, let's make the elbow pad one something bigger from all sides. Now you have no excuse. Keep that elbow on the pad. So we call right now that any advantage. And I understand, like, for example,
SPEAKER_01: Right now, like we saw the Ayana versus Dimitrina in a match when Ayana won and there was a quick pin and it was a foul. So I told referees before the Orlando event, I said, if you see
SPEAKER_01: A foul, but the other person is winning. Just don't call the foul. Just give the win. If the match stops somewhere, okay, you call the foul. But if you see someone is winning, let's continue. We can talk about all this. But as of now, the foul about the shoulder, trust me, that is not what we meant when you say shoulder square. Devon't move. Yeah, this load, I understand. But whenever it is driving and moving like this,
SPEAKER_03: That is not the rule that I meant when I said. Okay. Let me do a rebuttal on that rule specifically. Okay. So the initiation of the match is very important.
SPEAKER_03: To have a clean start is super, super important. Yeah. We agree. Yeah. Right. And, and there has been some slight variation on how we do this. Sometimes we we've decided that maybe just a go is better. We moved from a ready go, but we realized that people just start on ready. So it gets messy. So we're right.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we said don't move, because we said don't move. It means that people stay still, you know. And a little bit fast and go, so we don't do a wrist touch. Right. Now, the requirements to start a match needs to be fair. So that means the thumb knuckle is showing. Yes. The wrist is straight. Yeah. The shoulders are square. Correct. We start in the middle of the table. Yes. There is a discussion about webbing.
SPEAKER_03: which is a little bit more complex, but there is a webbing. The hands must be even, in a more vague sense, even than that. Right? Right. Now, what happens is at the point of go, all of this must be maintained. Till the go? Yes. Yes. Before they say go, if any of those things are altered,
SPEAKER_01: The subject is that it says, don't move. Right. Yeah. At the referee's grip, you say, don't move. Yeah. When it says referee's grip, we say, don't move. I understand being tight and loading, but not like moving. So how do you define that? Because, okay, because you just said that you understand loading.
SPEAKER_01: but loading is that being tight like like you can tie without driving yourself back okay so so no movement off center correct yes yes but that that is not only about the hand because we say we square the shoulders we say don't move so what happens if you move your foot what happens if you move your foot that we don't straight the foot okay what if you move your knee
SPEAKER_01: No, they don't do it. They don't tell to your knees. What about your hip? They don't do that either. You know, it's like, I'm sure you are aware of that because you have been pulling for a long time. Actually, I saw a referee foul people for moving their foot before, but what about your... They're strong, you know, like foot is different. We don't care about the foot. Why aren't these things important? Why aren't these things important? That is for like an equal start from both sides, you know.
SPEAKER_01: okay but but you can do some degree of movement and you can do some degree of loading so if you're not loading i understand but but that's just going like just like okay so so what is the difference what is the difference between loading and starting loading and starting is the movement like movement i can be i can type myself statically without moving back you know we just went over
SPEAKER_01: Listen, I can understand a little, but not just totally like you're doing a complete... And this is not about you, Devon. This came for anyone who is also... I will tell you something honestly. I will tell you something honestly. And when Kamil asked the referees before he pulled against Tobias if he can stay like this, and referees told him yes.
SPEAKER_01: so and i talked with referees later because after the match because i didn't know the conversation but the wrist needs to be straight it can't be straight or it can be like this right so what i'm just doing knuckles showing center of the table webbing even shoulders so what i'm just trying to say that it is not only uh about you like i also talked that to the referees
SPEAKER_01: And I said, no, wrist needs to stay straight after that he can pull up as he likes. That is not being against. Come in, but it is also like protecting the other opponents rights as well. Because like, if you are centered here, your hand center, right? But you do this, your hands centered, but your arm is already in moving this way. I understand everything that you're saying. And to a degree, I agree with you. However, there is a point that we needs clarification and that's the loading.
SPEAKER_03: If the loading does not result in a change in thumb knuckle, in wrist, in webbing, in movement off center, which is the critical one. And the shoulder. No. No, no, my friend. That is not the rule. The rule. Shoulders square. Shoulders square. But we say don't move.
SPEAKER_01: Devon't move. You understand? Like you don't change. But what if there's loading, but what if there, so why, why, why is there no early start called? Why am I not being called with early start? That's what I'm just saying that like static being tight yourself is okay. Maybe a little bit like tightness is like shaking at the center is okay. But what I'm just saying that a clear movement that is really, anytime you pull the opponent off center, it's an early start.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, if you are pulling, yes, but if you are tight here, you can load, but without moving, you know what I'm saying? You can be tight here. 100%. You can't pull the person across the table before the start goes. That would be a foul or that would be a warning or a foul. But if the result of your tension does not move the match off center, you're good. No, if your shoulder is the same, then yes.
SPEAKER_03: As long as your shoulder remains square to the table, that's the rule, is it not? No, as long as your shoulder doesn't move, the same thing. Hold on. Shoulder not moving is not in the rules. Shoulder square. No, shoulder movement is when you say don't move. You don't move. Okay, so are you saying, hold on a second. So are you telling me that when they say don't move, you're not allowed to move anything?
SPEAKER_03: Normally, yes. I'm going to tell you that this idea is flawed. This is a flawed idea because you will have to draw lines and it will become more and more difficult.
SPEAKER_03: what as much as we can you know like like i i see that like you okay you're you're chasing you're chasing something you're you're doing some kind of an over enforcement of the anytime somebody pulls you off center it's an early start it's that simple
SPEAKER_01: if you if you pull a person before they say go if you pull a match off center it's a it's a foul it's a warning that is not the rule that we have it i understand as an athlete you will but that is the rule what i just try to say you have this whenever it wasn't if you are doing this
SPEAKER_03: that no with you here you tight tight ready go and then you do this moment you can do with the go not not before the go before okay so where is the line where is the line what am i not allowed to move am i allowed to move my spine am i allowed to use my left arm what about can i move my left hand i mean if if you are going to leave the pad peg you know i mean that is not allowed left hand so where i'm resting right hand am i allowed to when they say don't move readjust my grip and my left hand peg
SPEAKER_03: Am I, can you hear me? Can you hear me? I don't know if we still have audio here. Yeah, I now hear you. I got you. Yeah, a little bit less, yeah. Okay, say again. I'll try and summarize a little bit because I think we were getting off base a little bit.
SPEAKER_03: I think you and I have a little bit of a disagreement. Okay. And I absolutely respect you. Okay. And we continue to argue and that's fine. We've done it for 30 years. Yeah. Listen, whatever we do argue, whatever we argue, whatever we disagree, it will never change.
SPEAKER_01: my opinion about your importance in armwrestling. Those are two different things. We may have argument this, but whatever I just think that what you have done for the sport and how great armwrestler you are, it doesn't change. No matter how much I angry with you, somebody just comes and tells me this and I will never deny that.
SPEAKER_01: And I expect the same thing from you. I mean, if you really meant to what you said, uh, in the past, but just know that from my side, it doesn't change. I may, I may even listen. I may even Devon, um, which being part of these things, I can quit seriously. And I'm like health considerate, but I don't want to be remembered that you understand that that's not what I deserve. I have, I have, I have done a lot from my side as well. And.
SPEAKER_01: Nobody would say otherwise, Engen. Okay, okay. Because for me, it's the same way. It will not change who you are, what you are. Did you see this guy? He wanted to give you... I can't see the comments. I'm not looking at the comments. No, no, this guy, they came here. My friend. Hey, Engen's telling me that you said I cheated you.
SPEAKER_00: No, I called it before ranking. And I explained a lot of things. Because if everybody wants to take advantage in the setup, but the fault is from a referee.
SPEAKER_01: You understand what they mean? You know what happened, Devon? Devon, you're buying your return ticket for Wednesday? Like, Sunday, after everything is done, Sunday, Neil pick up, James, Robert Baxter, Hermes Gasparini will come into Yalova to train. And Ozan Kocek and other guys will come. And we want you to come to Hermes and he's going to train with you and I'm going to ref.
SPEAKER_01: Perfect. Payback. Payback. I don't think he's in good shape. You will be exhausted maybe after the match. I don't know how hard it will be. It sounds like fun. Yeah, it sounds like great fun. You will join us?
SPEAKER_03: I would love to. Yeah. Yeah. Great. Great. Just you and Jody. Just come be my guest. Yeah. And we'd love that. Yeah. Maybe this guy, maybe this guy is trying to figure out how good you are. Plenty. Good. He's plenty. Good. Yeah. I listen and I tell everybody army's about our match. I tell everybody that I got you on the best timing possible. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: You had four weeks in between, Jerry. I know that you accepted the match when you were not. I was ready. I was so ready for a match. Really, I don't make excuses about my loss. Really, 100%. Engen was throwing you under the bus earlier. No, it's about who has more possibility to cheat, he asked me. And I asked Devon. Everybody knows.
SPEAKER_00: What does that mean? What does that mean? Mean that when you want to take some advantage in this... Okay, okay, Hermes, be specific. Hermes, be specific. What is he doing specifically? And let him answer and defend himself. Where did you feel that it was unfair? Because let's talk about this, you know. Because everybody has a character, you know, in the competition.
SPEAKER_00: and the devil is very angry when there's some referee he did they told to him some he complained a lot and the referee is intimidated you know what they have a hard time to give some force some warning i i i i can you tell me can you tell me
SPEAKER_01: where does he do devon wrong because you talk about something which is not specific where do you feel that it was not fair everybody want to take some advantage in the setup me too because you complained to me after the match i know he was stronger but i didn't feel fair
SPEAKER_01: So as an organizer, I feel guilty, like I'm doing something. So just tell and let Devon also defend himself. So everyone talks and then we'll be clear on this. Where do you feel? Rabin or what do you think? I saw he was stronger for sure, 100%. I lost. But every time when I see his match,
SPEAKER_00: and him and Jody complain to the referee, the referee is a little bit intimidated and they have a hard time to, you know, to make some holes or... I see like this. But where specific? You still don't say any specific. Like, does he... Maybe for this reason the referee gives to him more liberty. You know what I mean?
SPEAKER_03: more okay what is your response i didn't i didn't hear too much there um like i'm not i'm not so are you saying that i got away with elbow fouls are you saying that i started with a bent wrist
SPEAKER_03: Are you saying that I covered my thumb knuckle? Are you saying that the match did not start in the center of the table? Everybody did a mistake. Which infraction should have been called by the referee that was not? What did I do specifically that should have been called? The most part of you, when there are some problems,
SPEAKER_00: It's because you want to take more risers possible. It's your best part. Did the match not start in the centre of the table? No, I don't show every match. I don't feel it. What was your feeling? In which way did I cheat you? I didn't cheat, but I felt the referee was intimidated.
SPEAKER_01: you know when you when you speak with him very aggressive I see them a little bit you know you need to be more specific because this is your chance let me talk wait this is your chance Devon is right in front of you and
SPEAKER_01: Like, where did you feel, like what you are saying is that Devon is talking, the referee is intimidated. So there needs to be a result of this. So Devon is asking you, what did I do? Did I cover my knuckle? Did I bend my wrist? You need to say, wait just one second. Specifically, what is the result of this intimidation? If you are saying that he is intimidated, what did referee do wrong as a result at the table?
SPEAKER_00: they need to do don't care because maybe they want the most famous at least and they have some scary about the defense of devon they attack you are still not answering what i say hermes you are still not answering what devon and i ask like
SPEAKER_01: Referee may be intimidated, but what is the result when you grip up with Devon? Where did Devon do wrong, like get advantage? If referee is intimidated, he must be given advantage or something, or he must not seen the advantage Devon is taking. But where was it? Do you see any unfairness with the grip? I saw another match.
SPEAKER_00: When he was with Dennis, the leverage was a lot higher. This is what we have been asking from the beginning. You are saying he was higher than you? I need to explain.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. I'm sure I was not prepared for this match if maybe we had the same result. But only what I feel, what I see is this in every match. It's difficult to speak only about my match. I speak about all the matches. You mentioned the Dennis match.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that I started without my thumb knuckle showing? The fault is not yours. No, I understand that you're saying it's not my fault, but even from a referee's perspective. Okay, so is a referee's job to enforce the rules or to go beyond the rules? So the rules in arm wrestling are knuckles, wrist straight,
SPEAKER_03: center of the table, shoulder square, and then there's a thing about the webbing, the hands must be basically equal. So you're saying that my webbing was too high.
SPEAKER_00: is that what you're saying my weapon is too high some advantage like everyone for sure okay but but in the at the beginning you're allowed to take a grip right did dennis and i dennis and i just took a grip like i remember when i arm wrestled dennis some parts video you was more higher and he was completely down but okay but this was his choice this was dennis's choice it's not your fault
SPEAKER_03: I don't think it's even the referee's fault. I don't think anybody was at fault. I don't believe that that ref, that ref, that match was poorly reffed. I don't look at the Dennis match and think, wow, what a terrible referee job they did. I don't think that even a bit.
SPEAKER_03: i don't see where the poor reffing was in the dennis in my match either i don't see where it was in your in my match i don't see where the poor reffing was in in john in my match with uh i don't see look it i don't really see me cheating people to a win and i and i don't see it in dennis i don't think i cheated dennis to beat him i don't think i cheated george don't don't misunderstand it
SPEAKER_00: I don't tell you need to cheat to win or another things, or you cheated every time. But every time, like everyone, but for your aggressive character with the referee,
SPEAKER_00: They give you to use some more advantage to have more liberty in the setup. I don't tell you are weak and you cheat, you win, these things. Hermes, I'll tell you from my perspective, I feel as though the referees are constantly alerted about me.
SPEAKER_03: I think that every single match that I'm ever in, referees are told, watch Devon. Devon's going to do this. Devon's going to do that by everybody, publicly and privately. And I think that the referees pay very close attention to me. And I think that actually sometimes they go too far. And this is why I respond. Why if you see all the matches? Why you make all the matches for the set-up?
SPEAKER_03: They need 20 minutes and the other athletes, they need... How long did we take to set up, Hermes? How long did we take to set up? No, no, no. I speak for all the matches. Well, let's look at them in particular one at a time because I'll tell you why in each example why I take time. I will not... I will not consent to start a match when I feel that I'm getting... I do not allow myself to be cheated. So I continue... I...
SPEAKER_00: continue to feel when you feel you are a good setup for you or to to to pull you you will start to pull before not exactly okay and the but the problem is for the the your opponent if he don't feel good for to start he will complain every time this is the problem why the setup will go more longer than other
SPEAKER_03: matches, you know what they mean? We all need to have a long discussion about the start of an arm wrestling match. Okay. In my opinion, in my opinion,
SPEAKER_03: there is something that we need to try and i understand that at the highest level it's difficult to implement new rules and things at east versus west or something to that degree there are steps that the sport needs to take to clean up the start i'll be the first one to jump on board with that because i agree it needs to be cleaned up especially when we're looking at live audience
SPEAKER_03: We need to speed up the process. We need to make it fair. It has to be fair for everybody. We need to be able to enforce the rules. We need to have athletes know what's expected of them and be able to perform. I have a small criticism. You said that we need to speed up the process. Especially on a live show, probably. But do you really not think that...
SPEAKER_01: It takes longer in your matches, and it is always your opponent's fault. Look at, hang on, I do not start matching. If I'm not happy, if I'm not happy, I don't start matching. I watch your matches, but when I watch the chance show match, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: they have you can't blame the chance sean matches time signature on me watch the match the whole time i'm saying start the match start the match start the match he is disengaging he is going and sitting on his hair this kind of like long starts happening your match do you think that it is good because it doesn't happen every time or is it look it doesn't it doesn't look at i don't care if it's a show or not i'm there to win
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I will not accept being cheated on the start. I will fight. That's always been my policy. If someone is getting. Other athletes, like when they pull against each other, this process is quicker. Just seriously, like a little bit, little bit. I don't think it always is. Self-criticism, like a little bit. Like, why is it always your opponents are complaining? Like, because you are not the only one. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe it's because.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe it's because I am very, very, I think that I understand the rules very well.
SPEAKER_03: And I think that I understand them to a point where I even understand the differences between the leagues and the subtleties that are there. And sometimes I can argue a point which confuses the referees and they don't have the answers. I'm there to fight. I'm there to win. It's no revelation for people to understand that I have a pretty good endurance. So the longer you don't understand you or because they're...
SPEAKER_01: or they are frustrated you know like with your reaction because they don't have this kind of response from any other athletes i mean like they're asking what just now to say any other athlete do you believe that i'm the first person to ever do this what's that do you think i'm the only athlete no no but yours is just like a constant you know like
SPEAKER_01: always regularly and and okay i don't think that they don't understand from the rules but it is it is like maybe they are as i am saying they're intimidated frustrated by by your reaction or i i don't know but but i don't think that they don't know the rules i i think
SPEAKER_03: That they realize that my arguments are fair and just. And that's why I'm not fouled. And that's why the setup takes a long time. I think when I'm up there speaking with the referees, they understand that I have a point. But when you get fouled, you know, you also like whenever you had the match with Levan match, the first round, first foul.
SPEAKER_01: i mean i wouldn't give that easily but but you get it and then you were very angry about it with the referee i was angry i was super angry yeah because it's not a foul that's not even what i'm saying that like the devil you can't i was okay
SPEAKER_03: You can complain, but not too much. Hold on. Hold on. I can complain when I'm unjustly fouled. Okay. I think, let me ask you, let me ask you what, what is the procedure when someone in the setup before, I don't think we were even in the referee's group at that time.
SPEAKER_03: It doesn't have to be. If referee is gonna force to stop the match, it says shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder. Shoulder.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no. You made a foul because you were under the table. No, no, no. That's the second one. That's the second foul. The first foul was in the setup and I had my shoulder. It should have been a warning.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, but you had two warnings. That's how you get fouled, by two warnings. I was not issued a warning. I don't believe I was issued a warning. You had two warnings. Either you were in the referee's group, because you don't get direct foul without the referee's group. What is the time structure between warnings? Like, can you say, warning, warning? No, no, no, no, no, no. You say, shoulder, shoulder, shoulder. In my opinion, you don't stay there, shoulder, and then...
SPEAKER_03: I remember fighting about that with the referee because I felt it was unjust. I felt that to give me a foul or a warning with the position of my shoulder was unjust. And that's why I fought against it. If it had been like an obvious false start or something like that, I would have been like, fine. But I thought that was too hard. You talk with the referees and they understand that I am right. And whenever you get fouled, this time you are saying that it was unjust.
SPEAKER_01: Is there any foul that you receive justly or you never make mistakes? Oh, no, no, no, no. I absolutely foul when my elbow comes off the pad or I blatantly start early. Do you realize that other people are also getting fouls at the start as well? You are not the only one. So the problem is that nobody is really saying that you are the only one that has started getting fouls. Other people can make mistakes as well. Another thing, none of this...
SPEAKER_03: Like it's not to question your legacy. Like if I'm using the correct English. Listen, I'm just thinking about my next match. I'm just thinking about Petrenko. I'm thinking in 12 days, I'm going to have a match and everybody's talking about the rules and this movement thing, this movement thing is important.
SPEAKER_01: This is why you get, because whenever you lose weight, you are, because Paternico has very strong side pressure. So I think that it is very important you to like load it before. Now, when you do that movement, you you're showing me move the hands and that's not what will happen. That will be clearly a foul or warning.
SPEAKER_03: If any time you pull the match off center, that's clearly it. But what I'm hearing from you is that the movement of the shoulder, when the hands don't move, you're saying that that's also a foul or a warning. And this I'm struggling with. Can you explain again? Can you slowly? Because you remember about five minutes ago, we lost the sound. And then when the sound came back, it came with very low sounds. Can you say slowly?
SPEAKER_03: Right. So I'm really, I it's true. I am concerned about the upcoming match. Yeah. The rules are important. The rules in an arm wrestling match can be the difference between victory and I'm, I will abide by any set of rules, but they have to be the same and everything that's gone on in the past that East versus West. I'm fine. I am 100% fine with all the rules that it, that has happened up to this point.
SPEAKER_03: I don't have a problem with the referees. I don't feel that I've been unjustly targeted. It will never happen. No, I'm not saying it has. I will never allow history to be written like in a, in a, that way, especially in an organization that I'm organizing. And I'm not saying that. Okay. Yeah. I have honest mistakes been made at times. Yes, of course. Of course they have. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I'm saying what we need to do is clearly people are upset. Clearly people are upset about something. So we need to define exactly what that is and fix it. Okay. And it has something to do with the start.
SPEAKER_03: There's something going on at the start which people have a problem with, okay? And it has something to do with loading and pressuring and position that we all need to clarify so it's the same and nobody's accusing anybody of cheating or anything because that's just silly. I don't think that we should have champions and referees being involved in this mess. Hutchings should be clear. If an athlete fouls, they can read it. To me, it is very, very clear, but you and I, we understood the,
SPEAKER_01: think differently like when you say that like the past events however it is you are happy like i remember like i told you that like when when kamil said if he can start like this and when referee said no that was a mistake in that match i'm not saying that kamil couldn't win anyways or something i'm not saying about that but that there was a like a wrong
SPEAKER_01: application of the rule rule says the wrist is straight just because this this seems like a disadvantage it doesn't mean that you can start it needs to be straight not this way not this way straight the same the shoulder you can load it but whenever you start driving your elbow
SPEAKER_03: or like this. I don't like that you're showing, I don't, I feel like there's two things being confused when you're giving this example, because every time you do it, your hand is moving and this confuses the subject. If the hands move, it's obviously a foul or warning. Okay. Obviously. Okay. It's been a warning. Okay. All, all false starts and movements. In our organization, this is when the referee says, don't move. Listen, if it is not referee's grip,
SPEAKER_01: If shoulders are squared, that part I understand. But if it is referee's grip, if referee says don't move, that's not only for you. For anyone, don't move. If it is like coming forward before the ball is the same. Can we agree? Can we agree? Can we agree?
SPEAKER_03: like they cannot come forward or they cannot go. The shoulder square, you can load it. I understand if it is like one centimeter, you are loading a little bit, but whenever it is a constant movement. Please, please, I understand. Okay. First off, can we agree that the East versus West referee's grip is not the WAF, East versus West, sorry, the WAF referee's grip? Can we agree on that? It's the same as like the, like the,
SPEAKER_01: flexible. Like we don't give that flexibility. And what is that flexibility? We don't give direct follow, we give warning. What's that? Before, at the beginning of the East versus West, I was just saying, don't even give warning. Just make sure that they are muscle. But whenever I realize that people are taking advantage, and then I say, hey, listen, this needs to be a limit. Let's be flexible, but not like totally flexible. So make sure that we don't allow, but we don't give direct follow. We give
SPEAKER_01: warning and then okay so we so we made sure that the athletes will also not to make the same mistake four times because right according to the web it's just too foul you know move faster so we do warning so that they need to make the same mistake four times okay all right are there any other differences i mean like like like little bits little bits like elbows so are you telling me that the referee's grip other than the the what
SPEAKER_01: say it again no i'm not talking about only only the referee grip difference yeah i'm i'm telling you that the little thing like like for example you to type back in the buff emma's also pulled i mean you cannot even breathe you can't but this is not what i'm saying
SPEAKER_03: you can you can just a little bit like load but whenever you are driving yourself you understand like driving non-stop like like like like a little bit like as as we do the elbow elbow a little bit yes okay let me let me let me help you let me help let me let me please help you engen let me please help you okay okay so in my opinion the ideal way to call this and and please understand that i also i'm an athlete
SPEAKER_03: But I am also a servant of arm wrestling. Okay. Please, please understand that. Okay. So, so I know that the start will forever be an issue. Okay. And, and, and we want matches to start any movement off center is a warning.
SPEAKER_03: in a referee's grip has to be, if you are with your person and you pull them off center, as it starts to get close to a start, it's obviously a warning. However, both athletes can pressure up any way they want. So long as the match does not move off center. That's not the rule we have with, we can discuss. I understand. But the thing is, is you are going to get into so many little things. So no. So basically what you're doing is you're pushing it back.
SPEAKER_01: towards WAF and where is the line? No, no, no. I'm not pushing it back toward WAF. I'm just saying that you can load it. At the WAF, you can't move. You're frozen. I know that. Yeah, but this is not what I'm saying. I'm just saying that
SPEAKER_01: i don't want like a visible shoulder going like this okay but whenever every said this i understand you just load it and like this i understand we just we just give this much of elbow foul yes but whenever it's getting position gain or something i just don't want like too much movement the same with the shoulder square and then before the goal no i can't you know it would be so easy
SPEAKER_03: You know, it would be so easy again, what Hermes and I are arm wrestling. He has a button. He has a button and I have a button.
SPEAKER_03: When Hermes is happy, he pushes his button. When I am happy, I push my button. If he's not happy, he releases his button. When we're both happy, both lights are on. When they're on for like a second and we're both good, the referee says go. Nobody complains. It's like we have like hundreds of answers. They all have some opinion, I understand. But I mean, everything can be discussed. But I like...
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I don't want to say anything that you would misunderstand, but like, I mean, we can't really like do the rules by the request. Whatever. Pretend it's not me asking. Pretend that it wasn't me that asked.
SPEAKER_03: Pretend that it wasn't me. Pretend it was your idea. No, no, no. I always listen to everyone. We have a problem. If it doesn't happen, I don't want you to be upset. We have a problem. Do we agree that there's a problem? Yes, and the problem can be fixed once every athlete follows the rule. Okay, how about this? Hermes feels he was cheated. Okay? And it's kind of in a vague way. If Hermes was pushing a button,
SPEAKER_01: that said that he was good, he can't say that he was cheated afterwards, right? I mean, Hermes would never push that button. Why not? Because he wasn't comfortable, but referee had to give it to him. You said that everything used to be short, and he wouldn't just make it longer. So you're saying Hermes would never find a place of comfort? No. I mean, in that match, he was not comfortable, but referee had to give a goal anyways. So, Hermes, you never felt comfortable the entire match?
SPEAKER_00: No, really. In our match, when we weren't set up, I didn't have access to push my power because I was completely weak here. You know what I mean.
SPEAKER_00: And I think we need to discuss with all the other athletes one time, only one time, next time, and to fix many things. And I say what I think about you, about the rules, and I don't think there are many things to add out of this.
SPEAKER_03: I just, I'm a very, very big fan of, you know, when I lose having a feeling that I was actually beaten. I like this. I like when I pull LeVon, regardless of what happened in the first round, LeVon beat me. No problem. He's the better guy. I've been beaten by John Brzenk. Better guy. I've been beaten by Travis Pagent. Better guy. I've been beaten by Genadi. Incredible. You know, what I hate
SPEAKER_03: And it hasn't happened to me, but I hear people say they don't have that feeling. They go away from a match and they're like, and they don't feel like they were beaten. They feel like they were cheated. This is terrible. This is terrible.
SPEAKER_00: stop look look to look to see my my videos after our match what i say yeah and that's why i was surprised that's why i was surprised when i said it i said i said in the setup i fed completely compromised my wrist
SPEAKER_00: I said this and don't make any excuse about our match, nothing. I said only your matches in the set-up are ten times longer than they complain with the referee with the other matches because you attack the referee a lot and they are a little bit intimidated.
SPEAKER_03: no okay i hear i hear everything you said and that's great and that's fine and i never heard you say the word cheating when you described it to me now but i heard from engen that you said you got cheated so that's why i was
SPEAKER_00: Who do you think is the best cheater in wrestling? And I responded, Devon. Okay, so maybe the word cheater needs to be changed. Cheater is not a really good word because you want more to take advantage than other guys. I think you understand what I mean.
SPEAKER_00: I understand it, but I don't think I'm breaking the rules. I don't know. I don't know now your outer match, but sometimes you make some mistake with like everybody. Yeah, but I don't think I've been fouled out of a lot. It's not about you. Because if the referee make your, if you do something, they give you a foul and that's it.
SPEAKER_00: And they have some struggling moments. They don't give a foul or they don't have... Because if you remember when it was with the referee, Bulgarian referee, Cristo, from your fans, when you lost with Genadi, he was, yeah? On the social media, they attacked him like crazy.
SPEAKER_00: and maybe next time he is a little bit intimidated to refer you and to give you another fouls this is what i think i i think just christo and i are fine this is an example it's not are you telling me that risto is scared of me no i don't know but it was it wasn't this situation
SPEAKER_00: Do you think so? Do you think Hristo is intimidated of me? I don't know. Did you just say that Hristo was intimidated by me? I don't know now. I don't ask it to him. But I think yes. I thought that's what you said. I thought that's what you meant. I think yes. You think so? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So you think Christo gives me unfair treatment in a positive way? No. I think all the referees, when you have some matches, you complain too much. And you think that affects the way that they referee you? And you think that they should be fouling me? If they see something wrong, yes.
SPEAKER_03: And what is it that they are not calling that they should call? I don't know. I don't know now. That's important. I don't know. It's important to know what I should be fouled for if you're saying that there's a problem. Why the setup is 10 times longer than other matches? Where is my offense? Is it a foul to take too long to set up?
SPEAKER_03: No, no. But if he's longer 10 times more, there are some problems, I think, inside in this box. What problem is there? Why have I not been fouled on it? Is it my opponent's fault? Is it perhaps my opponent can't get comfortable and they're continuing to fight? Maybe I'm just a difficult opponent to set up with. Maybe, yes. Hermes, even if they call you foul,
SPEAKER_01: You say that, why do I not get foul? That part, I don't understand. I want you to clarify. When you receive foul, you disagree and argue. When you receive- Not always. And listen, listen, let me finish one second. I don't always complain about fouls. I complain about fouls that are non-existent. No, but this is what I'm saying. Tell me the fouls that I've complained about. You are saying that it doesn't exist. When you don't foul, you say, I didn't do anything wrong. That's why they don't give me foul. Hold on, hold on. Say that again.
SPEAKER_01: Like when you receive, but let me finish my sentence. When you receive the file, you argue, complain about it, you know, and when you don't receive file, and then you are saying that I didn't receive file because I didn't do anything wrong. So what I'm just saying, even when you receive file, you don't say that I did something wrong and I received file. So that is how we can be
SPEAKER_03: justify when you say i didn't do anything and that's why okay because you don't so you you fall because you talk about what you're doing what you're doing what you're doing is generalizing my reaction to fouls there will be plenty of fouls that i've committed that i do not object to however there will be fouls that happen that i do object to okay remember that you did not object like
SPEAKER_03: like let me hear Orlando okay no problem okay okay let's let's talk about let's talk you want to talk about Genadi round one when he comes in for a press and he blew my elbow off the back that's a foul that's a foul no problem yeah but it was nothing to complain about it no exactly it's a foul yeah it's a foul yeah it was very clear yeah very clear very clear I mean there was nothing to
SPEAKER_00: Guys, I need to go. I need to go. We will discuss, I think. Okay, when you guys come to Istanbul, we can talk about it. And then all together we can talk about it. And all athletes. And then we discuss. Yeah, but this is better if we speak with all the athletes. And even with the referees. It's better for all of us. But the fault is not about Devon now.
SPEAKER_00: He's about to clarify everything with all the athletes and to have the rules and everybody knows the rules. Hermes, before you go, I want to say something. I am an organizer.
SPEAKER_01: like i'm not armless in devon he's not even my weight category if i ever pull it will be 77 or 85 kilo i talk about these things because you guys complain we just sit down all together referees athletes all of us and then we just say what is okay what is not okay and then exactly
SPEAKER_03: make a decision after i hear everyone but that that is not personal they won't trust me no it's just i hear all this accusation you tell me that all the athletes complain about me i don't have a problem it's not me who has the problem
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah yeah i'm happy to be part of the solution i'm happy to be involved in the discussions yes yes yes yes but all together let's go all together talk and mess folks because like they are also putting pressure on me you understand like but that if you guys are okay if if all of you got okay you know about like then you should not complain because i move by the complaint
SPEAKER_01: same same with the other guys that when they talk about some other things some other guy goes with the shoulder in some other guy's different way but at the end whatever we decide we need to apply that one but just it's okay we are all everything is okay we are a big family you guys just come to istanbul we have good time you are muscle oh by the way before what's your weight devon i'm so hungry i'm so hungry i know i know but i see some some some really
SPEAKER_03: big big weight losses i on the scale 250 like this morning this morning 255. so it's coming to 255 100. uh that's like 116 16 kilo 160. i'm so hungry i'm so hungry how you can go 105 ermies i'm coming ermies ermies i was 273 i was 273.
SPEAKER_03: so that's like uh what is that's almost that's like 124 kilo i was 124 on the 2nd of october so this is a big cut it's a big cut yeah yeah you need to be careful because if you do something wrong that you will lose a lot yeah yeah i was gonna tell you something just just you're checking your blood pressure everything like like regularly right
SPEAKER_03: I needed some spaghetti, Hermes. I needed spaghetti. I needed some pizza. I'm so hungry. Oh, my God. You're checking your health. Do you hear what I said? Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is a really big thing. Be careful about that. It's going to be awesome. I can't wait. I will be perfect. I will be so dangerous. That's my best class.
SPEAKER_03: This is my best class, 105. I am big. I am strong. Yeah, 105, I'm tough. I'm even tougher to beat in 105 than I am at 115 because I'm big. I'll be big. I'll retain a lot of strength. Obviously, I'm not as strong as I am when I'm super heavyweight. I'm still really strong, really strong. I think at 105, both Taka Jin and John will beat you.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, no, they won't. No, they won't. Yeah. Do you want to wrap up anything you want to say? No, we're good. We're good. Listen, obviously, obviously I pushed the rule system. We all know that I pushed the rules to their boundaries. Okay. And I, and it's my belief that most athletes do.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe it's coming to a point where the rules need to be re-looked at. Maybe because arm wrestling continues to grow and like everything, we have to do it right. We need to present the best product and we need to continue to evolve. And the sport is not about me. It's not about my wishes, but clearly there is an issue because enough people are saying it and
SPEAKER_03: the results don't align with what this thought is that's out there. So I suggest we all come together and make a more bulletproof set of rules, which is good for the sport, where athletes have the feeling that they weren't cheated and weren't robbed and walk away from the match with a sense of victory or defeat. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: And maybe it's good. Maybe it's good and this is all just... Listen, we have to talk about these things. Yes, that was like a... Because, as I said, I'm not the afterthought. I'm not going to pull you. These guys are going to pull you. He came here. He talked about what he thinks you talk about.
SPEAKER_01: uh what you think about this in istanbul we will have we can just sit down and talk 30 minutes about these kind of things and we asked to lalatin we asked to this i don't know alijan matushenko tatashins michael todd you know all of these guys and they they all say opinion and then of course i will listen everything and at the end we just do something that like we can't really make everyone like happy but at least we find some
SPEAKER_01: But in a civilized way, when everyone expresses themselves in a respectful way, I think that that is the best solution to the ideal. And the reason that I just wanted to, whenever I saw your comments, I wanted to clarify, when you come here and say, can you one more time, maybe people didn't watch the beginning,
SPEAKER_01: Can you one more time express what you exactly meant that it was not what you think about bravery, but it was how bravery was portrayed during the podcast. That is what you disagree. So that the young people that who are your friends that will have better understanding of what you meant instead of some manipulation. Bravery is a beautiful thing. And you're very brave. Most of my heroes are very brave.
SPEAKER_03: Bravery means putting yourself out there. Bravery means exposing yourself to defeat and public ridicule at times. Bravery means, bravery means stepping forward when many are afraid to. Okay. Is bravery also requires to challenge and not to give up. And even if something looks impossible and then try and even for the third time,
SPEAKER_01: there is a beautiful thing let me tell you a little story i i lost arthur macaro twice should i try third time that would be brave and you should try to live on third time that might be foolhardy yeah but but you are not gonna give up right that's good that's that's what i want to hear yeah it's not a shame it's not a shame no i i know and there's there's a there's a there's a
SPEAKER_03: There's two incredible lines that I've heard in my life. Um, would you be willing, would you be willing to sprint if the distance was unknown? I like this. Um, another, another line, another line that I like is this is actually not a line, but.
SPEAKER_03: sometimes um this is and i'm not going to give away a lot of details because it's it's i'm not supposed to but there are many tests of bravery um that are constructed uh you know when given an impossible task a task that is potentially impossible and and then one is posed with the question so you you are asked can you do this and the answer is no
SPEAKER_03: You don't think you can. And then the question is posed, but would you be willing to try? And a brave person says yes. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: yeah that is bravery i was braver when i was younger even when i went to european championships i was 65 kid i saw alan karev i was looking at him not like you know wow what a big guy but i was like how would i arm wrestling where should i attack like because i didn't want when i had the first time surgery first time you know what do you say in english narcos like the the thing that they give you to sleep
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, narcoleptic stuff, like sleep medication. They gave me that, and I, of course, went to sleep, and then the surgery. I was so angry with myself of how quickly they put me to sleep. I thought that I should be... Yeah, anesthesia, anesthetic, yeah. Yeah, there is, Genadi says that, Genadi says, angina is the best,
SPEAKER_03: And Devon and Hermes, you guys are walking in a park to me. Genadi is in the chat. Hi, Genadi. Hey, buddy. Listen, Genadi, when you talk about bravery, Genadi is extremely brave. Genadi is one of the people. When I think about arm wrestling and arm wrestlers and I think about bravery, Genadi.
SPEAKER_01: Genadi is brave. Yes, yes. Devon, you remember you were thinking that Engin, like I have Levan to pull, maybe a few more and then like no more to pull. But whenever you went down, you have like more challenges. And now you want to pull Levan, I hope at some point, but you have an unfinished business with Genadi. Right now I see your left arm is getting bigger and better. You will have some left arm challenges and then
SPEAKER_01: Like you versus Morozov, you versus this guy. I think the challenges will never finish. If you are looking for a challenge in this life, as long as the mothers are giving birth to the babies, the challenge will never finish. You will always look for something more to do. That is what I believe. Do you agree with that, that you will always have some challenges? Yeah, absolutely. Arm wrestling is a beautiful sport.
SPEAKER_03: And, uh, it continues to provide teaching and, uh, experiences that I, that I love. Um, and yeah, I will continue to seek challenges in the sport of arm wrestling. And inevitably that means everything that you talked about. So long as everything is hopefully the way I wish it to be, all those matches will take place and.
SPEAKER_03: I hope for my victory. Um, but more importantly, I hope for my continued time in the fight. Um, thank you. Thank you so much. You'll be, you'll be careful and don't, don't, don't, don't push your limits with the weights or something when you're losing weight. No problem. I got this. I 100% got this. I will weigh in at 105 kilo.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And it will be a glorious fight. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Everything is ready. Yeah, everything is ready. Yeah. Good. You see, take care of yourself, Devon. Thank you for coming. Thank you, Reagan. All right. Thank you for your time. Bye-bye.
