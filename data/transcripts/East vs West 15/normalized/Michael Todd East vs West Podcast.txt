SPEAKER_02: Hello, hello guys.
SPEAKER_02: um
SPEAKER_02: Hello guys.
SPEAKER_01: okay guys sorry i fell asleep and just woke up um michael is gonna join soon um
SPEAKER_01: hey buddy hang on a second i just turned on do not disturb how are you how are you doing sir good good good and you i'm well i'm well that's good that's good um so what's going on michael people people they all cut
SPEAKER_00: hopes from you. They said you are now has been and this and that. And now, including Devon, everyone is saying that you are the hope for the North America. All I know is I've done everything right since the surgery. The surgery probably ended up being a blessing. You know, let me get my arm fixed. I had been competing with a damaged arm for a long time and it taught me patience. You know, it taught me patience and it gave me that desire to
SPEAKER_00: to go after that overall number one again right because prior to the injury i was always like yeah you know i want to do it but how bad do i want to do it i already you know and now it's just it's a whole different mission it's a whole different um approach you know i mean i've said it numerous times um i just have a different a different feeling now so my job is to do the work and then just let god handle everything else so
SPEAKER_00: I'm motivated, I'm focused, and I'm excited about the future. But it is not, I mean, hearing all the praise and all the, you know, the, oh, I don't know, just there's a lot of people out there who are kind of in my corner right now. So I'm just going to keep doing my part and keep training. But yeah, everything's going really good on my end. Yeah, I kind of think that it helps to,
SPEAKER_01: have all those people in your corner right now. And then when you are, how to say, like one strong team from North America, it makes you feel more motivated, more confident.
SPEAKER_00: maybe so here's the deal normally i would say yes so the whole team thing feels great like all the north americans for all that feels great and this goes back to uh just how i feel like i'm on kind of a i have a different purpose it comes down to i don't really have the confidence it's just faith i just i just believe that um as long as i do the work that i'm responsible for you know god's got a plan and things are going to work out the way they're supposed to i just uh i'm excited about
SPEAKER_01: I'm excited about this point in my life where I get to, uh, share my faith and inspire other people to, uh, to, you know, wake up every day and try to be better than they were yesterday. Yeah. Yeah. So whenever we talk about all this, so I know your next is not, but eventually you're targeting Levan, right? Yes, sir. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Unless somebody beats LaVon first, but it comes down to, I don't know what's going to happen. So far, LaVon has been unbeaten in his professional career. He looks amazing. So many people think it's impossible to beat him. So if given the opportunity,
SPEAKER_01: That's the goal, right? That's the goal. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Since he is the number one and undefeated, it's normal that, you know, until, as you said, you know, someone changes this fact, you know, Levan is the person to target. Right. You often say that, like, God is with you and then this is a part of the faith, you know, is just what's going to happen. Do you ever doubt that maybe God is with Levan?
SPEAKER_00: No. So, and I don't think God is choosing, you know, I think God's with all of us. I just think honest to God, I think so. I just said, I don't think he's chosen. He's choosing. I think he's just using me as a vessel. Um, cause right now, like I said, the world, most of the world thinks LaVon's impossible to defeat. And I'm always been an advocate. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Right? So all with God, all things are possible. And I think, I think I feel that God is using me to prove to the world that
SPEAKER_00: if you believe, you know, anything's possible. Right. So I just, I don't know, man, it's weird. I can't explain it other than the fact that everything has been aligned from my ketamine treatments to the fact that, you know, it's so weird, man. I mean, losing mom, all the things I've been through, there's so many things that have aligned to make me think that I was left here for a reason. Like I'm still here. Like I never thought I'd be here without my mom. I'm still here because God has other plans for me. And I think it is,
SPEAKER_00: to bring more people to christ i just generally do i mean i don't know man i know it sounds to some people it doesn't make sense to me i can see it it's clear we all have we all have our own beliefs you know that i understand that you have your own belief i have my own you know yeah and yeah and but the uh very tough test amen yes sir i mean ganadi is gonna be a huge test this man is uh yeah thing is if ganadi is
SPEAKER_00: I don't know how to say this, but I think he's looking past me. I think he thinks I'm the same guy I was. I love the Georgii team. I love all my fellow arm wrestlers, but I have a special connection with the Georgii team. They're just really good people. When we get up there to arm wrestle,
SPEAKER_00: it's going to be serious business, right? Like I have something to prove. I think I'm doing something greater than, than I don't think I'm doing this for you. I think I'm doing it for a greater calling. I think he is just looking right past me and I'm tunnel vision focused on him. Like obviously the longterm goal is LaVon.
SPEAKER_00: But I know that I have to... Rebecca and I talked about it yesterday. Each of these matches are learning experiences, things that I will learn after the match that I need to improve on. Because to go against LeVon, I can't have any holes. So every match that I have leading up to LeVon is a way for me to find out what else I need to improve on. Regardless of how the victory goes, I will learn something. And I'm excited. So I'm excited. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand. Listen, Michael, there are some matches... I mean, I...
SPEAKER_01: I will tell you something like majority of the elite athletes, if it is a physical combat sport, I see very smart people and with big heart, like majority of the really elite athletes, really, really smart people. And, but some of them has really like bigger hearts, you understand? And Genadi is,
SPEAKER_01: just one of those ones with the biggest hearts in the sport of arm wrestling. And right now, you are the same type of person, but right now you are also additionally in a new, how to say, beginning point you have. And right now, I kind of see you, your mental state, as good as it has ever been.
SPEAKER_01: And so whenever I imagine you and Genadi are announced to the stage, like that is more than arm wrestling. Like, yes, there is arm wrestling, but this is not like only here that the, the, the fight, there will be, I mean, like big, huge, like I can even say like spiritual fight, you know, because you guys are coming there. I mean,
SPEAKER_01: But Genadi was on his way to the top when he got injured. And I know 100% sure when I went to Georgii and I did the interview with these guys, with Levan and Irakli before Devon match, and I also had an interview with Genadi and he also
SPEAKER_01: has the same fire that you have in you that he wants to become the best he said whenever and you are asking me Devon and Levan okay for this match this is my opinion but in long term here is your guy this is what he was saying so your match with Genadi will be huge match like for me like probably the biggest match on that card on that cards
SPEAKER_01: That's a crazy card. You saw the names. Right now, I'm not announcing, but whenever I announce all the matches, it's a crazy card. But if you ask me, your match is the biggest match there. I cannot explain. It's not a title match, but to me, ask me which match you want to see in that card. You're only allowed to see one match. That would be the match. You can't get another match.
SPEAKER_01: So I can't wait. I can't wait. When you pulled Genadi last time, it was, don't get me wrong, but more like ending point of your, you know, going down in form, you know, like it's just like the things weren't going. Right now you are meeting on this way, you know, to him during your...
SPEAKER_01: second rise maybe third rise you know in armistice we have so many downs and ups you know and this is why we say that we lose battle but not the war you know as soon as you get up and continue fighting you you you're not losing yeah so i can't wait michael i can't wait and do you think that gennady is maybe the strongest here or here opponent for you in that category
SPEAKER_01: So, I think you missed a super chat from Devon Oleg's love child back about five minutes ago. Yeah, I will answer, yeah. Yeah, that was my bad. Let me ask you a few ones. Since you mentioned Todd and Oleg's love child, I said it would happen. First Kamil, then Genadi, then Hermes, then World Championship. If Michael can't stop Levan like Devon did, watch out. Okay, okay. You go ahead.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so on the note about this being the one match you want to see the most, that's high praise from you. It means a lot. So that's really exciting. Here's the deal. Genadi, I've always known Genadi for 15 plus years. Watched this guy wrestle at WAFs and stuff. And I thought he was the Georgii version of me. He was a guy that once he got in the match, his confidence was through the roof. And the last thing you want to do is ever let that guy get confident. The moment he gets confident, he's a different animal.
SPEAKER_00: And I've always felt the same way about me. The moment I realize I'm in the match, I'm a very hard person to beat. And we're two people who will 100% leave it all on the table if we're in our forms, right? Like there's been a few times that I did not have that dog fight in me. And I don't think that's the case anymore. I think I have a lot of heart now. And back again, I think I have a lot of heart to fight, to stay in.
SPEAKER_00: So does he have the biggest heart warrior spirit in the division? Yeah. So if Devon was still in the division, I would say he would be equal to that. But with Devon being in a lot of weight, Genadi probably has the most fight and heart of anyone else in the division, just because he's a warrior. And he is a person who, like I said, the moment he gets confident,
SPEAKER_00: he uh he's a different person he's a different person so my goal will to do everything i can to keep him from getting confident kind of like how hermes i know that was his first match back and he's a completely different person but armies was able to to shut him down to where he never got that that pin or that victory that gave him that that boost of energy that upon you know what i'm saying like we didn't see that version yeah but do you realize that it was like
SPEAKER_01: Like first match after many years of break and injury. So he came to the fight with so many question marks. And then do you realize that after 4-0, like first four rounds, he started doing this open arm top roll thing. And then last two rounds, because he was injured earlier, so he didn't know how. And the last two rounds, somehow he was like, okay, I lost anyways. And he started...
SPEAKER_00: hitting the sideways, and then he even hurt Hermes in those two last rounds. Yeah, he's violent when it comes to those side pressure hits. I went back and watched my match with him from East vs. West 2 recently, and some of those hits that he did on my arm were very, very violent, right?
SPEAKER_00: um yeah man he he's nobody can look past gannati i mean you cannot i mean if you talk about someone who could potentially be the man he probably has more victories over levon than anybody like yeah all the people who are wrestling gannati's probably beat levon more than anybody so he's a threat to everyone including levon um and both of us are coming in in eight weeks to prove that uh
SPEAKER_00: that we're going on to pull LeVon eventually, right? So like the guy said, beat Genadi, couple more matches, one more match, whatever it takes to get me that title shot, that's the goal, right? That's the focus. That's the reason for all this work. That's the reason for this comeback. The comeback...
SPEAKER_00: know you gave me an opportunity to pull in the heavyweight division at the last event and then um you know dodican got injured you and you still offered me another match so that i could potentially pull devon at november 2nd for the world title and i appreciated that but the the goal was never a heavyweight champion i was just gonna stop by there for a little bit you know try to get that title defended or something and then the goal was always super heavyweight
SPEAKER_01: so the moment daddy cam was injured i was like listen give me a super heavyweight opponent and because that's that's where i want to be um i hadn't even really tried that part i really didn't know that i was i was surprised that you rejected the world title match at the heavyweight and you said listen like my body wants to grow and like my main target is to become the absolute best in the world yeah
SPEAKER_00: Well, the thing is I'm 51 years old, so if I'm going to go after it, I need to do it in the next, Rebecca and I gave me 24 months. I said, I will commit for 24 months. So, I mean, I go to bed at night every night right now, around 300 pounds.
SPEAKER_00: i haven't even really started i mean i i thought i would be lighter after so i'm about 10 pounds heavier than when i pulled camille i thought i'd be lighter you know when i got home like because i just thought hey things will kind of settle out and then i'll start revving back up about six seven eight weeks out so i thought i'd be 15 pounds lighter than i am now because i'm really about to start revving up in the next week or so
SPEAKER_00: So if I'm 300 now, and I'm not trying to gain weight. I'm just trying to fuel my body to be stronger. But I mean, my body is this size, and I'm not even eating. I don't eat bad. I eat one bad meal a week, one free period a week. The rest of the time is chicken and rice. You are in a healthy way, 300 healthy pounds. Yeah. This is probably the best shape I've ever been at this size. So I'm just heavyweight. Super heavyweight was always a go.
SPEAKER_01: It was nice to have a shot at the heavyweight world title, but like I said, I think I just have a bigger purpose and I'm going to do everything I can to make it happen. Your first match with Genadi wasn't easy. I remember for some years, the way that you are arm wrestling was a big, how to say,
SPEAKER_01: like technical problem for your opponents. And I remember Genadi even made a video and he said that he knows how to beat you. And so after that, so my question to you, does he know how to beat you or it was only that day? He did everything right. He did everything right. I made a couple of errors.
SPEAKER_00: And I think I was overconfident. But he arm wrestled flawlessly. So yeah, I mean, obviously he knows how to beat me. I just don't think I'm the same guy. And I don't think I'll be the same guy when I show up. I mean, I think the way things are going right now. So check this out. So just on Devon's pronation lift, right? So I started at 129. My record's 154. I started 129, ended up at like 179.
SPEAKER_00: Well, then when I got home, I did like a 181 and changed. Then the next day I went back to 154. So I was just going back and looking. Like July 27th, I hit a pretty high number. Now, I only trained to August 2nd. Think about that. I only trained to August 2nd. August 2nd was my last workout. So I was peaking perfectly. And the number I hit July 27th on pronation, I did yesterday.
SPEAKER_00: and i haven't and i hadn't and i still have how many more days left like so you have you have near two months not near uh maybe one seven weeks i have 49 50 50 more days to train essentially so i have 50 more pronation lifts or 49 more pronation lifts i think that's right i don't know it's a lot are you gonna do every day okay so here's the deal the lift is an everyday lift now just being honest if i do a lift and it feels good like here's an example
SPEAKER_00: i did the lift the other day which was a high number and then i did all my other lifts then i did an entire workout and then i did wrist rolls pronation rope pulling rice bucket flex grippers so after an entire workout so i did a lift and then worked out for an hour and then did the next day's lift at the end of the workout
SPEAKER_01: Which was crazy because I should not have been able to do it after an entire workout, right? Do you think it's a good idea to do that, like to get out of the plan and pushing everything there? Do you think that there is a possibility for you to, like, I don't know how to say, overtraining? So I think overtraining is real, but I think it's more of an under-recovering.
SPEAKER_00: I feel like if you can recover as much as you train, meaning you have the cold plunge, you have E-stem, you have all the things that you can use to your ability to recover better, sleep, supplementation, all the things. Like I'm finally about to be able to get into the hyperbaric chamber, which the hyperbaric chamber is going to help me recover way faster. But to that point was some days I would do a couple, like right now I'm about four days ahead of my lifts. So if at all, like say I want to take off tomorrow and do nothing tomorrow.
SPEAKER_00: let my arm heal i can take off because i've already done tomorrow's lift you know what i mean i'm ahead of the game so is it hard to do it every day yes and that's what i noticed on the last one is a couple i mean i was training so hard that i was like dude i gotta take a break so i took like two days off but i already had those two days worth of lifts done when i came back after a two-day break the lifts were so easy and i'll probably do more of that going through here but yeah so considering i'm moving the same way i was moving
SPEAKER_00: in my last week of preparation you know and i'm still seven weeks out and i'm moving away as good or better now i think that in seven and eight more weeks when i show up to pull ganadi i'm 10
SPEAKER_01: 15% stronger than when I pulled Camille. So I think that'd be a pretty strong guy. You know what I mean? I don't know. It's so hard to say. I mean, I mean, like, yeah, like when you, when you pull Genadi first time, was the problem about the strength, like if that day you were 10% stronger?
SPEAKER_01: Would you win or was it like some technical errors? You said you have made some mistakes. The mistakes were about not being strong enough or it was technical. Another quick thing I want to ask you, do you think that Genadi that will show up will be the same Genadi that showed up? Because Genadi also had a bicep tear, but what I can say for sure,
SPEAKER_01: The Genadi that pulled Devon was stronger than the Genadi that pulled you. I agree. Because he also built his, you know, how you are doing right now, he was also coming back from an injury. But right now, after his bicep surgery, this is his first match. I know he's, like normally if it was anyone else, I would just say it's his first match.
SPEAKER_00: Mentally, he's not ready, but this is Genadi. I don't think that he will be scared because he's, I think, confident after the things that he has done, you know? Right. So what was your opinion about all this? Well, the first question was if I would have been 10% stronger, would I have won? Possibly. Possibly. Even if I arm wrestled exactly the same way, if I was 10% stronger, I probably would have been able to win. But what I did wrong was I didn't, at no time did I ever walk my hand.
SPEAKER_00: in round one i hit back held he hit his wrist buckled and i thought i had him so i didn't move and then he walked my hand walked my hand climbed pronated cut me and got me out of position round two decent start whatever whatever i got never felt and then i thought his arm might have enough fatigue so i tried to press him it wasn't and he pinned me pretty quick just errors that i made but had i been 10 stronger on that day i probably would have won um had i made
SPEAKER_00: better arm wrestling decisions on that day, it would have been a much better chance. My preparation leading into that, it was the first time in my life I had ever not trained heavy. I just did a bunch of maintenance weight workouts for several months just so that I could be healthy because my belief was I was strong enough. And I said in a video the other day, I will never, ever, ever think I'm strong enough again. I will always try to be stronger. So second question, Genadi coming back off an injury,
SPEAKER_00: In my opinion, Genadi would not take this match if he had not already tested himself amongst the Georgii team to see where he's at. Like, he obviously is confident that his arm is ready to pull. So I have no doubts that the Genadi that's going to show up is a very well-prepared, strong Genadi, probably stronger than the Genadi that I pulled in 2022, right? That's possible, yeah. Maybe not as much as, like, Devon match, but probably something close, yeah. Yeah, you would think he... I mean, you would think, like I said...
SPEAKER_00: I know how hungry a person is after an injury like that. And I'm sure he had, he has had great people to test himself with. So I'm expecting a very, very strong version of Genadi. So 100% not looking past him, not thinking this is going to be a cakewalk. I just know that I will train as hard as I can for the next seven weeks. And I'll come in as prepared as I can, you know, on game day. Yeah. Thank you, sweetheart. I will have you and Genadi together.
SPEAKER_01: in a podcast before the event, but I want to, uh, talk about the King. Hello. Hello, Rebecca. How are you? Good to see you. Yeah. Thank you. Um, one last question I will ask about Genadi and then let's talk about King of the table. All right. Um, when, when I, like when Devon and Genadi, they were set to pull. And then when we had the podcast, we.
SPEAKER_01: how to say, we were talking about endurance and then I was just, you know, like Devon seems like someone that like, like the energy power never finish and the guy can pull forever, you know? And then whenever I mentioned this to Genadi, like Genadi, what do you think about Devon's endurance? And he, and he said like, why are we talking about Devon's endurance? You know, like why not my endurance? And like, when did you see me like,
SPEAKER_01: Like, how many times have you seen me, like, guessing out? And... Yeah, he showed us. He showed us that day, didn't he? Yeah, Devon guessed out, yeah. And so, my question... Like, if you beat Genadi...
SPEAKER_01: Do you think that you need to kind of overpower him? I'm not saying a flash pin, but just really with this start putting him in a bad position, or do you think that you may have better endurance than him? What I believe is the easiest way would be to get him out of position, right? If I could have enough strength to get him out of position at the start of the match,
SPEAKER_00: That would be my easiest. What's that out of position, taking his wrist? Taking his wrist, knocking past center. Or taking his wrist and keeping back pressure so much that when he tries to pull back out of it, he can't get out of it. So a strong riser, strong pronation, strong back pressure, and strong cup is what I'm going to need to defeat him. That's what I believe. If the match is a long, hard-fought battle, I don't think it will be a test of endurance.
SPEAKER_01: I think it'll be a test of heart. And I think on that day, I'm going to have more heart. That's what I believe. What do you think about Kamil's press versus Genadi's? Genadi's is more like side hit, like this way, while Kamil has the constant forward pressure. Do you agree with that? Genadi's is a bit more like
SPEAKER_00: Side mix, you know, hits. Genadi's way more versatile. Genadi can hit sideways without his shoulder, with his shoulder, everything. When he comes into press, if he just went press to press with Camille, like if they met in the center and said, hey, we're just going to press, Camille may have a stronger press. But Genadi has everything. So it's just hard to make a –
SPEAKER_00: It's hard to make like, it's hard to answer that question because two different pullers, two different angles, but yeah, definitely different. Genadi has an explosivity to him within the match. That is very rare. Very few people can explode, have explosive hits the way he does within a match. Um, his shoulder is his shoulder commitments. Unbelievable. I mean, remember when Devon was fully committed in a shoulder?
SPEAKER_01: And he, while in a hook, drug him out of his shoulder and then got behind. I mean, like, who does that, right? That's just crazy power. Oh, you're talking about Genadi when Devon was all over him. Yeah, and then he drug him back out of it. Like, he pulled him out of his shoulder. Who does that to Devon? That's crazy strength, right? Do you really think that, like, Genadi can be in that form after such a long break? Like, do you think that he could do the same thing today
SPEAKER_00: uh if that one was in the same shape do you think that like we're talking about bicep right right yeah do you think that like he would have the like i don't know like i i have so many doubts about this and the doubt the doubts are justified right but the same time i can't allow those doubts of his ability to to prejudice me going into the match i have to think he's the strongest yeah yeah yeah right because that's what i have to prepare for
SPEAKER_00: I can't prepare for a Genadi who's coming off an injury. I can't prepare for a Genadi who's not. I got to prepare for the hardest match of my life, right? Because that's how important these matches are leading up to every match.
SPEAKER_00: is the hardest match of my life leading up to LeVon. Yeah. Because that's what I have to accomplish to get to LeVon. Like, I don't just get to, like, I was talking to him yesterday, it'd be cool if I could just sit back for nine months and train for LeVon and I'd have to prove myself, but I have to earn the right to face LeVon. Yeah. So it has to go through Genadi and it has to go through someone else after that, you know. So I'm expecting, I have to expect the strongest Genadi ever. And if that Genadi doesn't show up,
SPEAKER_01: then that just means I prepared harder than I needed to. That's cool. I'm just going to be ready. Okay, question. Your open arm top role is, in a defensive way, better than Devon's? Like, for example, if that was round one, you were there once the match stopped.
SPEAKER_01: against Levan, and then when Levan put the shoulder pressure, you could stop that while your shoulder is not under without fouling. You're defensive, I'm saying that. I believe I have a better chance than Devon did, and I think Devon thinks I have a better chance than he did in that position. The thing is, I have to stop it first. It doesn't matter, oh, if I'm in this match, if I stop it here, how would the match go?
SPEAKER_01: it doesn't the first thing is stopping it you know so yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i'm saying that yeah so because devon and gennady round one devon got everything and then when the restart happened and then when devon went out and then gennady was directly hidden that way so he kind of forced
SPEAKER_01: Devon to pull inside game. Like, yeah, he wanted to go, yeah, he kind of, because if Devon was going out again, he was again hitting that way. So what I'm just saying, if that would be the case, you take the Genadi's hand, like Devon did on round one, like, could he also force you to play inside game because of the tough hits, you know? I would say no. I would say no. I think that...
SPEAKER_01: If I'm able to take his hand the way Devon did and take everything. Yeah. I think I'll be able to resist better. I mean, I just, you are, you are basically saying that your style, like you are more, how to say, like more experienced in such a defense while Devon is doing so many different things. He can, he's doing this, that, so.
SPEAKER_00: he is not really he hasn't really spent as much time as you did in such defensive style well of course not i mean devin's devin's open top roll is amazing it's phenomenal but he hasn't held jerry catarat for seven minutes on it you know what i mean um there's a difference like the places that
SPEAKER_00: Okay, that was a good one. If you've seen Rambo 2, the guy says, what you call hell, he calls home, right? In the places that the rest of the world would hate to be at, I'm extremely comfortable because I've been there for so many times, right? So I just have to be able to take his hand. I have to be able to take the center. I have to be able to outback pressure him. If I can do those things, I believe it's up to me. I mean, I think that guarantees me victory.
SPEAKER_00: um because it's going to take more of a taxi it's going to be more wear and tear on him than it should be on me in my opinion but well i mean i don't know man i'm prepared for whatever i just don't i don't see me going into a hook unless i choose to go into the hook i don't see him putting me in a hook you know oh okay yeah yeah i understand yeah yeah yeah and so let's talk about king of the table coming great cards incredible matches yeah and
SPEAKER_00: Some of the matches you may not know, Kasper versus Nadaline Hristov. Are you familiar with these guys? What weight class are they? They will pull 95-kilo category. I don't know the names offhand. I may know the faces. Yes. Did you set that match? No. These are King of the Table matches. I just didn't know if you had any input on that match itself.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I guess I can't speak on that one. Is that the one video Devon shares? Was it the Korean Hulk that was pulling you some years ago? Yeah, so that was a 2017 Arnold Classic day one. I was a little rusty on day one. On day two, I went undefeated, beat Dimitrina Trubin and everybody. So I won that event undefeated. I just got tied up with the Korean Hulk on day one. So that guy is really strong then. Well, I mean...
SPEAKER_00: could have just been the angle that i went to who knows but yeah he felt it was good resistance it was good resistance i mean so i mean you if you looked at that match you would not think i would have won the whole thing and beat truben the next day right but that's just how things fell right i got into a couple of grinders with a couple of people on day one my question would be like aldon's chance against this guy
SPEAKER_00: Like, I mean, I, I have complete faith that what they're doing up there is working and, uh, that you listen, Devon, tell it, he, you know, audience more obsessed than he is. So you'll never, you can never count him out. Obviously the stronger human is going to be the Hulk. The better technical arm wrestler is definitely gonna be. And if he can pump up the hand, all those different things that, that they're known for doing, then he's got a very good shot. You know? I mean,
SPEAKER_01: You're talking about having that match with this guy and then beating Dimitrina Turbin. And so your shape probably was much better than Aron. You would think, yeah. I mean, but like I said, that first day, you wouldn't have thought on day one, the way I arm wrestled day one, that I was going to end up winning the event.
SPEAKER_00: Just maybe day one, I got caught asleep. I don't know, man. I just know that day one wasn't my best performance. It was enough to get me through undefeated on the A side. Day two is where I really showed out. But, yeah, it's hard to draw a correlation to how I pulled on day one compared to where Auden's shape is. But obviously you'd think me winning the Arnold Classic and beating Demetri Trubin would have been a pretty high-level shape, right? But, I mean, I don't know. It's basically after the match.
SPEAKER_01: right right yeah so yeah i don't know man it's it's if you look at the two if arden was to beat him you think his level has to be really high we don't know what he's been doing we don't know what the level i mean we all have targets for sure but what i'm just saying that like until i saw the video you and him this guy um i was thinking that yeah alden has good chance to winning but now i kind of think that the like especially if the match goes to strap and then this guy
SPEAKER_01: maybe too strong, but we will see, you know. See, I don't know who put him out of the tournament. Like, I don't think he made it to day two. I think he got put out on day one. He lost to me. Yeah, yeah, but listen, after such a match, not everyone has the endurance. You can pull forever. You just said that you pulled Jerry on your arm like seven minutes, so you don't really expect...
SPEAKER_01: You could be exhausted just because you pulled some tough match with the guy. But we cannot say the same thing for these guys, because these guys are power lifters. Their power is just more like explosiveness, as far as I know. They are not really.
SPEAKER_01: good about endurance. Anyway, so we will see. If the power is close, then I'm sure Ardun will find a way to win. Right. And over six rounds. Six rounds could be a lot. I mean, because Ardun could blow him up in the setup, take a few losses. You know, there's a lot of variables, and I think they're looking to play that long game for sure. Okay. Yeah, yeah. He better, you know. That is the only thing that I would expect Ardun to, like, technical ability and probably...
SPEAKER_01: endurance but sometimes like if your capacity to hold the bar like just say 50 kilo and then if somebody puts your arm 60 kilo all the time you may also get exhausted you know because of you know of course of course yeah yeah anyway so that that that is so your your prediction is what oh man
SPEAKER_00: it's so hard i know i know i know you want to say like very positive things if it was betting if i was betting i'd have to say 60 40 the korean hulk just because it's your power but would not surprise me at all if arden wins well not at all like i would not be surprised at all okay okay so you are saying that he has good chances but not more than the korean hopes yeah i mean look at that look how strong that guy is i mean like like you said if it does go to strap
SPEAKER_00: And if he can just end it quickly, you know, if Todd never gets in the match because the strength gap is too much, then there's your chance. But I think he will find a way over multiple rounds to stop the fight before he loses four rounds. Let's see. I mean, I don't know the Korean Hulk. I have nothing against him, but I know Todd. And...
SPEAKER_00: Since Korean Hulk is not the guy from my league either, you know, and I support Arden, let's see how it will be. Who do you think would win between Arden and Larry Wills? Larry Wills would win. Well, didn't the Korean Hulk and Larry have a decent little on-the-table hook match? I didn't watch the one. I don't remember either. I just know they battled in the hook for a bit, you know. So, I mean, just give an idea of how strong the guy is, you know.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, Larry is a strong guy, you know. Alden is just coming, but I don't think he is there yet. Especially if Larry is ready. If Alden beats this guy, yeah, he can pull Larry next one. But I have seen even Jones struggling with Larry in some practice schools. Yeah, Larry is ridiculously strong. So, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'm just drawing a comparison. Go ahead. Larry giving hard time to Leonidas in a super match in the Dubai one. Then we saw Leonidas against John. Impressive. You were there, but John wasn't the regular John. John looked big as well. That was a 245 pound John. That was a regular John. You don't see John that big.
SPEAKER_00: But still, he put him in very bad positions. If John wasn't as knowledgeable and as experienced as he is... Man, listen. If that match would have happened overseas, I don't think John wins it. I think John wins that match because of the crowd. The atmosphere in the crowd kept John drinking that match. You don't see John pulling from those positions anymore. He fought hard in that match. He has done it, but when he was young. You remember his last match?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I am. I am Travis was just that he never sent me that $1 million. But you remember this subject? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, my cat's trying to tear up the gym. Um, yeah, that was amazing. Definitely. But I need to tell you how strongly and itis is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, the guys
SPEAKER_01: Since we started talking about Leonidas, what do you think about him vs Devon left arm? Do you think that Leonidas just made his game higher levels?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think Leonidas is a person who is progressing very, very well because his strength is so high and he's committing to arm wrestling. Devon has to be the favorite. In my mind, Devon has to be the favorite regardless of... But he also says he's back up to 115. He's 253. So a bigger Devon is going to be a stronger Devon. Yeah. 20 pounds a game. Yeah. So, I mean...
SPEAKER_00: I'm saying 75-25 Devon, but that does not mean that Leonidas doesn't get a win. That doesn't mean Leonidas doesn't come in with a press on him at some point, push his arm down. I don't know. Devon's clearly the favorite, but Leonidas is an impressive specimen, and it has a bright future, in my opinion. Okay. Okay, one guy says that Indian Korean Hulk won against Larry.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, was it practice pool or they were- That was practice, it was practice pool. I don't even know if it was on an arm wrestling table. I think it might have just been. This is Misha. This is the new one? Yeah, he's our Wildcat Bingo from Kentucky, Wildcat Bingos. He's super sweet, but he's gonna tear everything up. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: um okay let's go to let's go to you are saying that album is 40 60 underdog and devon is 75 25 favorites and then there are some incredible matches right yeah like like this card maybe the best best king of the table cards just just when you look at the match do you follow how
SPEAKER_01: Georgii Svetko and Serhii Kalnyshenko look great lately. Yes, you said Svetkov looks huge. Huge, yeah, but do you follow also Kalnyshenko? Yes, his forearm looks insane. He's doing crazy numbers. I think he has the best forearm.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it looks good. It looks good. Yeah. Kalanchinko has impressed me a lot. Yeah, I like both of those guys a whole lot. Like, two really good arm wrestlers. This is a huge opportunity for Kalanchinko. I think, personally, Spekov is going to be too much. I think Spekov, personally, is going to be too much, but Kalanchinko looks like a killer. I'm not sure about that. Like, Serhii, I was kind of surprised.
SPEAKER_01: when he beat Arif. Big time. And I think he broke his finger on round one. And I kind of was surprised. And now he's probably near 135 kilos or something. He looks huge. Wow. Yeah. And I don't know how this match will be. Even if he somehow loses his wrist and protects his pronator, this guy can also press that way.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think that even if Georgii wins that match, I don't think it will be an easy match. I think it will be a war. Huge. It very well could be. It very well could be. I'm going 60-40 spec off, but like I said, I'm not going to be surprised one way or the other because both of those guys just look like killers. Another one, do you see the physical progress
SPEAKER_01: Oh, Artem Morozov, recently. Man, he's back to that old Terminator look, isn't he? It made him better. He may even be better, but he looks like a specimen. Yeah, okay. One guy is asking, he kept asking, when will the East vs. West t-shirts move? East vs. West 14 t-shirts, all of them are shipped. East vs. West 15 t-shirts, we put them on sale, and next week we will start shipping them.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so how did you like the hoodies? Love them. Rebecca immediately tagged me. She's like, I got to have one of these. They look awesome, dude. I love what you guys are doing. The merch for East versus West is awesome. So yeah, I think it's really cool. Yeah. And another question before we go to Alex Kurdeca versus Artem Morozov match. You were offered to pull King of the Table.
SPEAKER_01: on September 28th. And there was like seven weeks from August 10th to September 28th. But you said, Engin, I need a good camp before a match. But what, like, just say that you won against Genadi, for example. Right. So here's the deal. No, no, no, let me ask first. Let me ask first. Okay, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Just say that you won. And then I talked with Hermes. Hermes said that he will be ready for
SPEAKER_01: January or February early, you understand what is the time for the East versus West 16. Right. Um, if God will, you know, and, but there will be December 14th and then North America king of the table. And then it looks like it's going to be like amazing because after the first experience in Orlando right now,
SPEAKER_01: Like you just remember that like eight days ago, the tickets were sold out. We had to make extra room. Still wasn't enough for everyone who wanted to be there. So this time I am expecting a place with 1,500 to 2,000 people in the next king of the table. And I don't know exactly where it will be held, but just say that you, you got an offer. Just people said that, just say, uh, you pull.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know the winner or just say Kurdesha and Morozov. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So here's the deal. Okay. I had to decline King of the Table. I had to decline King of the Table because I was already in preparation. I had already started my prep.
SPEAKER_00: programming for Genadi to me it would have been irresponsible to take a match and then only have five weeks after that match yeah when I'm allowing Genadi a full camp right yes yes I have to respect Genadi enough to where I have to have an equal camp yes yes but what is the what will be the case for so here's here's here's what I got if you make that match in February not January if it's February
SPEAKER_00: i will pull the i will pull gannati if after i win the match i would pull the winner of gurdetsha or morsov in uh king of the table north america that really is the determining factor if it's in north america if it's in north america i can't miss that because you can yeah yeah yeah i can't miss north america yeah so if that's december 14th i don't know what how the dates line up 18th 25th
SPEAKER_00: 2nd, 9th, 16th. So if it's like February 9th or 16th, I would pull Hermes then. But do you think that you would be risking? I'm going to say no, because I've already got it planned out. The surprise to me was the offer, because it was like, what was it, a week or two after East versus West? I think it was two weeks after East versus West. But I'm just saying that when you are pulling someone else before
SPEAKER_00: Hermes, would you be risking your dream, your target? Would you be afraid to risk that thing? Oh, you're saying if I was to lose, if I was to lose, I don't get the shot with armies, I don't get the shot with LeVon, whatever. Yeah, bro. I think this is what I think. I think I'm victorious at East versus West in November.
SPEAKER_00: I think I'm victorious at King of the Table if it's in North America. From that point, my mind tells me I need to beat Hermes, and then I'm next in line for LeBron. That's what my mind tells me. Yeah, I mean, it's logical, you know, logical. Anyone who is beating Hermes?
SPEAKER_00: I mean, should get a shot. And technically, I can do that by beating Genadi, skipping King of the Table, and still get the win on Hermes, and I'm still in line. You know, it would just be the risk of pulling the winner of Dexter versus Morozov in between, because really, like you said, Genadi, Hermes, and then I got a shot at LeBron, basically. That would be, and none of those are easy routes, but that's the safest versus pulling again six weeks later and then only having an eight-week camp for Hermes. My mind tells me
SPEAKER_00: that is possible. It's possible to have those three matches in that timeframe come out on top and then have a four month camp, whatever I need, whatever the match with LeBron would, would materialize. Right. Um,
SPEAKER_01: Right now, I can only focus on Genadi. I can only focus on Genadi. I will be accepting a match at King of the Table if it's in the United States. So your plan is to beat Genadi and then Hermes and to face Levan? No, I said I will be accepting a match at King of the Table if it's in North America. Yeah, yeah. But you also want to beat the guy in Hermes and then eventually pull Levan? Well, okay, so yes. To answer your question, yes. One second, one second.
SPEAKER_01: Hello? Jerry? Okay, he doesn't know what he's talking about, right? He wants to beat Hermes and he thinks the next opponent will be Levan, right? Okay, okay. I'm just joking. I know, I know. Yeah, so listen, I would happily vote Jerry because Jerry and I have history. And I think I'm more dangerous to Jerry than most because
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I know that I can take his press and hold it for a very long time. And it comes down to a war, right? Now, I'm rooting for Jerry. Jerry looks amazing. Jerry did phenomenal against Alex Kudetsch. I had never expected him to do that. Me neither. Me neither. I was thinking that Kudetsch was even slightly favored, but if somehow Jerry stops the match,
SPEAKER_00: that that he would win but he just dominated i don't know how i thought gadecha was going to smash him or jerry was going to win a long match i never thought jerry was going to smash it yeah so it was very very impressive so yes uh obviously i have respect for all the guys who are there um like like i said we don't know man we don't know the landscape like who knows if armies is going to be ready he says he's going to be ready we don't know we don't know what's going to happen with batali and um we don't know we but
SPEAKER_00: All I know is I'm going to be focused on Genadi, come back home, week of recovery, four-week camp, week of rest, pull whoever's in front of me at King of the Table. And if after that there's an offer to pull Hermes or Vitalii or whoever to get the shot at LeBron, I'm taking it. Okay, let's talk about Alex Kurdenko versus Morozov.
SPEAKER_01: Alex Kurdeca lost against Jerry, but we all know that it is the worst possible style to deal for an outside puller. He tried to do something different, but I mean, I really...
SPEAKER_01: knew that like something different wouldn't work in such a like you need to have a base if you want to try something different you can't just two months train spend all your life with pronation depending you know style and then just two months do something different and then i mean you can't do that to jerry you understand you really need to have a history of pulling in a different way you know and if you've never pulled jerry you don't know what's coming like
SPEAKER_00: That's why I think I had, you know, pulling Camille, I had so much experience pulling Jerry. Now, they pull differently. They have a different press. But I have so much experience pulling a flop press that I was comfortable pulling Camille, right? But you have to, yeah. It's just hard pulling Jerry if you've never pulled Jerry. And you're definitely trying to switch it up once your plan A doesn't work. It's very difficult to do if you're not proficient in those other lanes. So, talking about Gurdjieff versus Morozov.
SPEAKER_01: It could very easily play out the same way Vitalii versus Morozov did because of the superior length and top rope. But Morozov could stop the match and make a ridiculous... We saw their left hand. Their left hand was insane. One second. One second. One reason, like, Vitalii is much more explosive than Alex. Alex is also explosive. Vitalii is just like right to the pin pad and his grip is just like incredible.
SPEAKER_01: And second of all, yeah, and Morozov right now, as we talked, looks kind of different, Michael. He looks, his arms and everything, he looks really different. So probably he will be in a stronger shape than the time that he beat. And I think he made a big mistake when he pulled against Laletin.
SPEAKER_01: 100 he should have went backwards he should have went backwards with this trap yeah he should he should start loading time you know before the goal oh my god yeah i mean morozov is someone like who is not really like explosive he usually stops people here and then beats and then you're gonna try to make a evenly start with
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii is going to kill you. You need to start loading because if you don't do this, when you are like 80%, you will get a hit 100% on Vitalii. So you need to start loading, loading, loading. Near 100, you need to start so that you can balance the power. You cannot just, I mean, I can't. This is how Hermes stopped him. I was going to say, just like Hermes. Hermes made him look not as explosive because he mashed him in the setup. And still, Hermes stopped him right here, like right here, you know, barely.
SPEAKER_00: If he didn't start with all that back pressure, he would get flushed every single round, you know? Right. Yeah. So do you think that there is some difference between Kurdesha and Vitalii? What we have is we have two guys who are very starting to catch off. We have two guys who are coming off losses. Morozov's coming off this Fetkov loss when he was sick and the recent loss against Vitalii that I don't think he was expecting. So he's hungry as hell. And I think that's why we see this different version of Morozov. He's like, I'm taking it to another level.
SPEAKER_00: i think alex was very well prepared going into uh jerry he just did not have the right game plan i think he was very strong so now he's got okay because his trajectory was going up now it's got you know he's backslid a little bit so what we have is two guys who want this badly um so if the match is somewhat even we're gonna see a dog fight that'll be crazy it's just how does morzal attack
SPEAKER_00: or counterattack Alex's top roll. Does he match him with a top roll of his own? Does he go towards him like he did against Vitalii, which I think is a mistake? Or does he, I don't know. So it's a 50-50 match for me. But I think it's a huge match, especially for the super heavyweight rankings. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Incredible, like incredible match. I think it will be more important even than the left arm match because this time, like,
SPEAKER_00: The one who loses will lose some credibility. Absolutely. So on this note, real quick. So you were just briefly speaking, if I beat Genadi, possibly a match of me versus the winner. Of those two guys, let's say... Or maybe Kalinchenko. Or Spekov. Spekov, yeah. Because they can all get visas. They can all get visas to you. Sorry for cutting you.
SPEAKER_01: that some of the Eastern guys may have problems with getting a visa. There is some small problems, like I don't think any Russian can get American visa.
SPEAKER_01: right and maybe schoolboy he has been there before and his brother is there but other than that like georgians usually having some problems some of them can get but we if we are going to organize more east versus west and king of table in united states we really need to start working on the visa all all these people yeah that's why i said that yeah like just imagine if morozov wins and somehow we cannot get with the usually kazakh guys
SPEAKER_01: can get but we will see but we need to start that procedure as soon as possible absolutely and i agree i agree and that's the thing is we need to be able to have the world's best come to the united states because yes like you saw the united states crowd is very receptive yeah i mean that that is the best best you know like we need we need people need to accept that you know a few things about the united states but first of all that is the motherland of the modern arm wrestling
SPEAKER_01: i mean as i said like if you just tell me are missing legends from uh 80s without like just tell me anyone who is not from north america and a legend from 1980s so that is how it started who top road side pressure and everything started from there and another thing is that the spectators the fans over there they know how to make it
SPEAKER_00: fun oh yeah i mean i'm telling you people like i had a guy here who was used to be a pro football player and he's done all kinds of crazy things he said that was the most exciting event of any time i've ever been to in my life yeah yeah that's a guy who played professional football that's huge you know yeah so here's my question listen whenever whenever i made the name east versus west i mean my main goal like
SPEAKER_01: behind my head just to make sure that we are all united because we were divided, you understand? So I was successful about that one. But whenever I also mentioned East versus West, I also really touched a bit to the patriotic feelings as well. And that worked as well. It was just over there, it was just like,
SPEAKER_01: You know, it was that some patriotic feelings, and I saw it that way. And then many times the North Americans came here, usually the Eastern guys were more successful, which wasn't really fair from this way. That when you say East, you're talking about 25 countries. When you talk about West, you're talking about a couple of countries. So still, you know, United States is very, very successful.
SPEAKER_01: But it is just because they are representing the whole West together with Canada, sometimes Brazil, while we're talking about Georgii, Kazakhstan, Russia, Bulgaria, you know, all Ukraine and all those countries, you know. So in this time, but do you think that it really made difference to have that time zone difference and travel?
SPEAKER_00: going to say yes i think it made a little bit of difference just because it may not have been the times it might have been having the u.s crowd there you know having that many people that many i don't know it was just a very magical moment like that that whole event was very special and i loved it um back to my question i was gonna hit you with the wall go let's just say it is the winner of war's offer and let's say i do beat a strong gannati which opponent
SPEAKER_01: Between Morozov or Gurdjieff, do you think I match up better with? If I'm victorious over Genadi, which means I'm a good match. Which one would be better for you? Yeah, what do you think, from your opinion? Listen, there is a possibility Gurdjieff to beat you without getting into the war. But somehow, if you stop the match, the match...
SPEAKER_01: will for sure go in your favor my opinion right with with arthur morozo him to like flash pin you dominate you right away is like harder possibility you understand like like less possibility but i believe that he can be in a war with you uh but i don't think that
SPEAKER_01: morozo has ever experienced uh something like you can make him experience right so i i think that your chance against morozo is but we listen we don't know the the we don't we don't know anything yet this is all this is all just you know perception what we believe right now we have no idea right we know we know morozo the morozo that i know is i know what i'm talking about but the morozo that i see currently i don't know that guy
SPEAKER_01: don't know he may come and just do something really crazy and we all learn something new i don't know but i i my guess um listen like it is very hard to beat you michael if you are in a good shape great shape we saw you versus pushkar and and it is not that easy we have seen you versus dennis in his best years and
SPEAKER_01: So, yes, he won, but it was not easy. We remember, you know, how it was. So, I don't know, like, these guys are strong, young, you know, everything, but the experience is different. Like, how many people can pull in the way that you pull and these guys experience? Just tell me. Who pulled like you? Like, when did...
SPEAKER_00: alex pulled someone like you when did morozo pull these these guys are still young and i not many people in the world pulling like you do right and i was just excited like i'm i'm just excited to be back in the conversation right it's just it you know you know how long we've been doing this man i mean we've been at this game for a very long time to have this opportunity to go after you know
SPEAKER_01: something that's been a goal, always is a goal. And to be in the position I'm in right now, I just feel truly blessed and thankful. Do we have more matches to talk about from King of the Table? What else we got? I don't know. I'm just reading some. It is right in some things, you know, like we are acting like you already won or something. Just stop doing so many assumes, you know, like about me, especially if you really want to exist in this comment section.
SPEAKER_01: I don't want to just go more, but this is not. We are talking about the guest plans. Everything is a guest. Yeah, guest plans. I would be talking with Genadi. I will also talk from his perspective and his plans. Yeah, so just understand the difference. Just stop bullshitting over there. And what were you saying, Michael? Sorry. It's all about do we have more matches King and the Ted will talk about.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we have Camille versus Corey. Come on, man. Oh, my God. Yeah. Corey, did you hear that, Corey? Listen, man, Camille is a – it's Camille Strong that I gave him credit for. He really is. I knew he was strong, but it's that ability to press so committed-like and watching his – so I've recently started doing his show. I finally got a – I found a way to set up for me to start doing his pressing thing.
SPEAKER_00: and the numbers he's pressing is ridiculous you know saying like those are really heavy numbers and the fact that he'll set up with the weight already he'll push in the weight where he's holding it so his static setup without pushing his opponent just saying that the center table is insane so i was telling course i listen we have to be able to match that you have to be able to match the fact that he won't be pushing you but you feel like you're being pushed but he'll be in the center type because he's so used to having all that rock steady pressure
SPEAKER_00: Man, I think Corey is very strong right now. And what's crazy, and I don't know if you know this, Corey believes his right is better than his left right now. Yeah, I know. But this is the left arm match. I know it's the left arm. But, man, I think Camille, he's the higher-ranked guy. I think he's favorite. But I think Corey's got a game plan that he might come out on top.
SPEAKER_01: My opinion, first of all, you tell me, much better than I do, is your training partner. Corey with right arm, Corey with left arm. Yes, yes. And people don't know that. They're like, oh, he's going to cut me. I'm like, that's his right arm, dude. His left's a pronated top rope arm. He went into a hook with Farid because Farid pushed him into a hook. So he had to hook Farid, right? He had to shoulder press. That's not his left hand move. No, left hand. I will tell you something, my opinion.
SPEAKER_01: The way that he pulls with right arm has better chance. Against Camille. Because you need to control the pronator. Once you overpronate, you are more vulnerable to your brachioradialis. But Corey is a big guy, huge guy. And I think that his side pressure, listen, like Laletin is known to dominate the hands. Like his grip, everything is incredible. Right. Laletin is not known someone
SPEAKER_01: with like huge arms and strong, you know, like pressure. Of course he's good, but it is because of his hand dominance that he really takes everything, you know? Right. So what I just tried to say that, but whenever you're pulling against Kamil, Kamil doesn't care, you know, Kamil, you take the hand. So Kamil doesn't care that Lallessi's hand is so strong and then takes his wrist or something.
SPEAKER_01: So what I'm just saying that we're talking about the match, the opponent is already like this. And then how much you can do the pressure to the winning side to take the guy to the, you know, losing position. So what I'm just saying, you would know better how much pressure Corey can do to the side way with the goal. Like, do you think he can take him to the past the center with the speed? And how is his speed? I know his right arm speed.
SPEAKER_00: is very good is his left arm as fast as his right arm so here's here's what i would say watch the monster factory event where he beats cody merit look how he out he just pulls right through cody right um and a lot of what we're based on is how how camille beat cody cody was able to hang up camille a little bit i think corey's ability to hang him up is way better but i also think corey may be able to hit hard enough sideways with the hand
SPEAKER_01: to potentially push him outside his shoulder. That's the only way to win. The only way to win. You are not going to win coming by hanging him here and outlasting him. Very, very hard. Trust me, this guy with left arm has stronger pressure than his right arm.
SPEAKER_00: It's ridiculous. So I think it's a huge ask for Corey, but I think Corey will be more than prepared and I'm excited to see him. I'm excited to see him shine. So it would be, it would, it would be sad for Camille to lose to me and then lose to Corey. Cause you know, we come from the same place, right? So it would be unfortunate for him. But I do think Corey has a legitimate chance. I genuinely think he has a legitimate chance. Okay. What's his chance?
SPEAKER_00: 50 50 you believe i i want to say 50 50. like i i honestly think like we'll find out round one round one's gonna tell us everything round one we will know is this gonna be camille gonna dominate him or is corey just gonna have so much horsepower and the ability to just keep him corey is strong and see corey blew his bicep in 2020. most people who tear their bicep that the stuff comes back stronger so corey's strong now like he's
SPEAKER_00: Just like I think Genadi is going to be real strong because my doctor told me that my bones would splinter apart before my tendon came back out. But don't you think that yours took some time? Yeah, I mean, but what was he like four months behind me or something? When did he tear his? Like July and I tore mine in March or whatever? No, but when I say that it takes time, I mean, you had so many matches prior to this match. Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: i got you i got you yeah yeah yeah so but i don't know i think i'm going 50 50 camille and corey obviously i'm hoping corey pulls it off i just know that if if corey does pull this off this is a huge win right because that there's a lot of stock on camille of course yeah then we will have different type of conversation for corey's future absolutely right yeah definitely
SPEAKER_00: And the last match is, as far as I know, is Rob Vision Jr. Nugo Chikadze. Do you remember Nugo? Oh, of course. Yeah, very strong. And I don't know why John, I haven't spoke to John. I haven't seen the thing. He said that he didn't recover. That match was really hard, you know. It definitely was. And positions he pulled from, so it makes a ton of sense. He has to be the favorite going against Rob because he's Georgii.
SPEAKER_00: all the georgians are super strong but um he uh rob is a talent he's a gifted he's a gifted genetic freak he has the hand he has huge arms he says he has some lanes that he he wants to you know try to try to be competitive at i have to say it's 60 40 uh nugo but you know god i love watching rob arm wrestle and getting there and fight so i'm excited to see what happens okay
SPEAKER_01: Anyways, Michael, thank you very, very much for your time. Is there anything before we finish the podcast you want to say about Genadi? Any message for Genadi? Any message for your fans? Yeah, great respect for Genadi. I fully expect to have a very strong opponent across the table from me.
