SPEAKER_04: How are you all doing? Okay. Let's start.
SPEAKER_04: hmm yep let me share on instagram as well and then let's start i think it will be a few minutes later levan will join us i think he was on his way
SPEAKER_04: Just talk with him on the phone. I'm feeling okay. Kind of late, but it was the time that was available. So that's okay. I'm used to it.
SPEAKER_04: okay now i'm done and let's oh huh the one just came that's good i think i click this did i not
SPEAKER_00: Hello, hello, Levan. Hello. Good to see you. How are you? Good. I just now picked. From training? From training, yeah. The same place? Same place, right? Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So where are you now, your form? Which percent? 70? I think like 80, maybe 85. Oh, that's good. It's good. And you still have three and a half months. Yeah, I have good time and
SPEAKER_03: Preparation is going very fast. I grow strong, strength very, very fast. And now I need a little bit. Not like last time. Not like last time. Last time you come back from injury. A little bit breaks. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And people, I didn't watch the video, but did you make a video that you will break his arm or something? Jerry's arm?
SPEAKER_00: Uh, yes. And today I, um, I have training, um, top row training and I break my, um, uh, what I do. Yeah. Is break. I do 70 kilo on, uh, yeah, I understand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but what I'm just saying, did you make a video? And did you say to Jerry, that you're gonna break his arm? Hmm. Can you say something like that? Yes. You said it? Okay. Okay. Okay, Henry Nehring says, Are you going to focus on side pressure for Jerry?
SPEAKER_00: Somebody's asking, you're going to focus more training for side pressure for Jerry? Yes, of course. Yes, of course. And what is the possibility that you would go directly to the press with him? Press? I don't know. Press is too much. Take side pressure.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, of course. Last time when we chatted with you, you said you may need a special preparation for Jerry. Do you still think that way or do you think that's not necessary? Yes, because...
SPEAKER_00: Last time when I pull, I pull guys who pull top roll and maybe biceps, but Jerry's technique is... I need to special trainings for him because he pull not normal, you know? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Different direction, right? Different direction. Yeah. Yeah, there is Weld Mishrev. What does Levan think? Is Jerry going to be a harder match? Engin, thank you for everything you did for this community. All the best. Thank you very much, Margaret. He is asking if there is a possibility that Jerry may be a harder match compared to the match before.
SPEAKER_00: I do everything for it is for me not hard yes but Jerry is very dangerous and if we can see matches when I lose I lose in his technique you know it's Genadi, it's Arif
SPEAKER_00: It is long time ago, but it is fucked. And it is dangerous and I take that this much and I training very, I need to train very smart and very seriously because
SPEAKER_00: uh because he's yes he's dangerous i see how he pulled with kennedy and kennedy has very uh stronger side pressure but jerry jerry with jerry she has very very um um how is
SPEAKER_00: After training, my English is not good. Jerry is a very, very different type of puller. Yes, Gerrard has very strong side pressure, but with the Jerry match, we can see how Jerry would pull in side pressure. What I understand, Levan, is that if you beat Jerry,
SPEAKER_03: You better beat him quick. If it is not a quick match, if it stops here, then the problem starts. And the guy has very good endurance. You know, Genadi has very good endurance, but Jerry also had very good endurance. And Jerry also had a very long match with Georges Svetko. And he just doesn't stop. There is a super chat. Pom-pom rider, I think. One or two years, Brian Shaw will be amazing.
SPEAKER_03: God bless you both. He says that in two years, Brian's show will be amazing. He says, yeah. I hope, I hope. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm telling you that if you know how to do it and then do it, then yeah. But if you make a mistake, like I think that to win against Jerry,
SPEAKER_03: Levan, it's all about the preparation. Like, you need to do the right preparation. I think if you do the wrong preparation, then you may have a big shock. And then you will just say, oh, shit, you know. And so... Like Alex...
SPEAKER_03: Alex, yeah, this is exactly what I was going to say now. Alex did everything, clothes and that. And you remember you and I, we had a podcast before, right before the event. And you said you think that Alex is going to win because his technique is bad for Alex. And many people I saw in the comment section, they are like, oh, stop dreaming, Levan. But you understand arm wrestling, Levan. You understand very well. And you also understand that.
SPEAKER_03: If you don't pull, just imagine this, Levan. You just pull his wrist and then try to hang like this. And then it may be a problem. He may be opening your brachioradialis. So that's why you need to control. I don't think only side pressure, but I think someone needs to also with this wrist here, the bottom side of the wrist, you need to really control his pronator as well. We'll show you how we need to pull with Jerry.
SPEAKER_03: from Hermes. Hermes pulling with Jerry in 100 possibly. He said us how we need to pull with Jerry. Yeah, correct. But just remember that Jerry didn't want to fail the main event. The guy was on antibiotics for like three weeks. He was really ill. I'm not taking anything from...
SPEAKER_03: Anything from, uh, Hermes' victory, but after Jerry beat Alex, right, like in one minute, Hermes called me and on the video call and he said, Engin, yeah, this guy probably was really ill when we pulled. I'm not saying Hermes cannot beat him. And I'm not saying Hermes didn't pull right away. Hermes pulled in a perfect way, but I think that sooner or later, I think they should pull one more time. That's right. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: How is everything? You said 80-85%. I don't know. Now I hope I do my
SPEAKER_00: what my best shape, 100%, I want to go not 100, but like 110, 150. I need more. How to go in preparation? I think I can, because now what I can lift,
SPEAKER_00: it is like close my best shape close and i have more time like three three months yeah three months for training and maybe two weeks for rest yeah three months three months uh it is very long time yeah especially if you are already in good shape like now i started training a month ago in one month i
SPEAKER_03: I close in my best, you know, close. Not my best, but very close. Yeah, yeah. But listen, I will tell you something, Levan. If you would be at your very best right now, this is bad news. It's not good.
SPEAKER_03: your best always needs to be competition time right now you need to go slow slow slow slow slow if you are if you would just say now you are 95 100 i would just say it's a better bet because you cannot say 100 95 all the time you need to stay here a little bit there a little bit there and then make sure that your best or even 110 is the competition time yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's good. That's good. How is Irakli doing? Irakli also has a very important match. Irakli was last days been very sick. Yeah, he told me this, yeah. But he has time for him one month. In one month, no problem. Yeah, he's very young, very young, yeah. In one month, he can...
SPEAKER_00: to his best shape and I'm not nervous about it. His opponent is a very good guy and I have a big interest in this match. Really very good opponents. Is there any goals with the weights that you want to lift?
SPEAKER_03: I want to... Before you answer, Levan, I want to ask you, you remember when I come to there, you said, Engin, in the past, maybe I was lifting heavier, but you said that right now I lift more correct. You remember something like this, you said. Do you agree that, you know, lifting correct is very important? Yes, yes. I agree. Yes, yes. And so what I'm just saying that for you, more important is the heavier numbers.
SPEAKER_00: or correct training right now? Balance? Yes, balance. Okay. For big weights, for your ego, for your... Yeah, yeah. For your... Confidence. It's very good. But really strong,
SPEAKER_00: coming for good technique lifting. Really strong coming after this. But for psychically... You are saying that psychologically you need to see big numbers, but also... Big numbers, one month, one time to take for your
SPEAKER_03: okay so it's strong yeah it is normal one one month you need to see how much you can do doesn't matter how correct okay okay i understand yeah yeah that's good that's good yeah that's it's a way to way to motivate yourself yeah and now i i want to um um maybe in bench press to my uh record i don't know we will see how it's going
SPEAKER_03: Can I ask you something? When you have, when you do bench press and the weight is just pressing your wrist like so much like this, does it sometimes hurt your wrist? No, no, no. And how is your wrist doing now? You can tell honestly, you don't need to do any kind of strategy or something because Jerry is not going to topple you. Devon't worry about it. You can tell us.
SPEAKER_00: now very normal shape i do 60 kilo six time no problem i not rush yes but i have good progress yeah yeah i think that right now your opponent is jerry
SPEAKER_00: you don't need to really push the limits, but more like focus on the health. So that for the long term, when you pull against the top rollers, you know, it will be ready, yeah. Now I'm training wrist for after Jerry, maybe Vitalii or something. For Jerry, I do try...
SPEAKER_03: Levan, how did you find the atmosphere in Orlando? Oh, very scary. And then imagine that in December you go in North America and imagine there will probably be this time 2,000 people
SPEAKER_03: and then they will be yes yes yes i think yes because because like we sold out all the tickets already eight days before the event and like we didn't have any place i think it will be like my opinion because i talk with people i am in touch with so many places in america they say and you know organize here and you know organize here let's come here and do it and my guess is that there will be
SPEAKER_03: Like minimum, minimum 1,500. Because if I would organize the Orlando event, not in August, but after what happened, after like how the experience was, if I would do it that next month, there would be 1,500 people. But your match with Jerry is for the world's super heavyweight title with right arm. And there will be some big matches, really big matches as well.
SPEAKER_03: And I think that arena or whatever the king of the table will organize this will be just like, I mean, incredible, incredible. And then you will have very big pressure from North Americans that's supporting Jerry, Jerry, like 2,000 people, yeah. Yeah, it's good. Georgii is coming. Georgii is coming to, for me, support, I know.
SPEAKER_03: It is being Las Vegas or? It's not, it's not, it's not set yet. It's not set. I talked with Devon. I asked time to time, how is he doing? And yeah, Georgii will be 50 people. The Americans will be 2000. So you, you will barely hear Georgii, Levan, you know? No problem. No problem. Okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Because you know why I say this? Because you said for Orlando already scary. And now this one will be double. So let's see how it will be. Yeah. I need to win all America with Jerry. You need to handle all the psychological pressure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Who knows? Maybe, maybe, maybe I would get the visa as well. And then just watch. Yeah, it would be great. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so when you look at the, you, you watch the jumpers in match and after jumpers in one, the camera turned to the crowd and people were just getting like crazy like this. You remember that like the same thing happened when you pull against them, that the crowd was like,
SPEAKER_03: crazy you know do you think that arm wrestling is becoming uh like a mainstream sport that it will grow that there will be time that 5 000 people will come and watch the arm wrestling do you think that we have that potential yes of course we can make uh our wrestling in georgia and i guarantee
SPEAKER_03: 5,000 people is coming. You are a national hero there. Whenever you say, Levan, 5,000 people, I'm talking about 5,000 people just say paying $50 each person I'm watching. There must be many people, but I'm talking about in North America, 2,000 people actually going
SPEAKER_03: and paying and watching so it means that we are becoming yeah in america it's possible yeah yeah yeah yeah but but i saw how you are in in tbilisi you know you you were just like everyone knows you we can't even go on the traffic everyone just that i today my my friend maybe you know uh giga which he is he won the olympics right paralympics yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, this is the guy in his hotel I stay, right? Yes, yes. And we even a little bit arm wrestling, remember with him? Yeah, he in the World Championship second or second, second, yes, in World Championship. Oh, in WAF he took second place? Yeah. Wow. And what did he do? Did he throw something? I didn't understand. Yeah, it is, how is on English, I don't know how is, like ball, not ball, it is... Iron ball?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And he does that on the wheelchair? Yeah. Oh, okay. And he do world record. He broke the world record? Yeah. Wow. You remember when we went to the dinner together, you, I, and him? You remember you told me to arm wrestle with him? And then we were like, you know, he was very strong, you know, yeah. Yeah, very strong.
SPEAKER_03: There is another super chat, Megaboy. He says, ask Levan, who has better chance against him, Jerry or Vitalii? So basically he is saying that who is more dangerous, Vitalii or Jerry for him? Both are very dangerous. Different ways, right? Different techniques, but both are very dangerous. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: and let's talk a little bit about the upcoming king of the table and yeah i want to i want to ask you uh at least some of the matches um okay let's start with john bruising go ahead one minute before we started what about you much with the vaho and para
SPEAKER_00: You see that much Georgii guy? Yeah, I know him for many years. What do you think about that much? Because he became very popular. Yeah, I saw like many million, like 15, 20 million people watched it. What do you think about this much? How is other guy?
SPEAKER_03: How do you see it that much, what you can say? Whenever the guys smile? Yeah, like smiling, not taking... Yeah, I think he didn't take him seriously. I was there, you know, I was in Moldova. He didn't take him seriously, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think he's very young and I think he underestimated his opponent. I think he shouldn't be smiling like that. I don't know what he was thinking when he was smiling. I don't want to judge him, but I know the Georgii guy is a warrior. I have seen him for many years, like in a very hard way. If he stops you, he's very stubborn. You know, he would fight to death. And you know, Levan, it's not because of your face, but I don't know, you are maybe,
SPEAKER_03: third generation of the georgian guys that i have seen you know first generation i saw like those zaor and samkaradze and
SPEAKER_03: All those, Eric Legurciani, you know, all those guys, Thomas Kutarashvili. And then the next generation was more like Jabba and other guys, you understand? And then your generation came. And now I see one more generation. The young guys are coming. And like Georgii and I, we always felt very, very close, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, like we always have been very good friends. I want to say thank you for you, I know you pay for Georgii team. No, no, no, just... It is... No need, no need, no need. People need to know this fact.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you. No need to thank you. We are all brothers. The same thing the Georgii would do for me. I have no idea. These things, no need to talk. I have big respect for the Georgii, as you can see.
SPEAKER_03: We have very good relationship with you guys. For me and for Georgii people. Anyway, so let's talk about the king of the table. Let's talk about it. So now, did you see the recent photos of Artur Morozov? Did you see any recent? Yeah, I see Morozov's photo. It's like a Photoshop, right?
SPEAKER_03: White Ronnie Coleman. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this guy, after his loss against La Lettine, I realized that he took it very seriously. Now, I remember him almost the same shape when he was getting ready for you.
SPEAKER_03: Last year, when he was getting ready, when he pulled Corey West. And he was like very similar shape, but right now he looks incredible. And his opponent, Alex Kurdesha, is also very dangerous. Yes, Alex lost against Jerry, but... When did this match? This match is this month. King of the Table. Ah, King of the Table. Yes, yes, yes, yes. They said this match... I saw it going in...
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no. They are going to soon share the poster of the match. But I would like to talk about it because it is a very good match. You remember their left arm match was very close. So how do you see this match? I see Morozov is in very good shape. He is ready. But how good and how in good shape, Alex, I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Alex is like, when I see him, he's like, maybe one time he's in really good shape and after the second tournament he's in really bad shape. I don't know how he's training, how he'll be ready for this match. But Morozov, I know, Morozov
SPEAKER_00: like every time he's he tried to be in best shape but i not see from alex that do you think that alex lost against jerry because alex wasn't in good shape or or alex also made some strategic mistakes you know i think uh alex uh
SPEAKER_00: will lose if he be in best shape. It's because technically it's bad for him. But if he be in best shape, maybe... Longer match. Longer match, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But can I ask you something? The way that he was standing, you know, was like a cloth like this. Do you think he also made some strategic mistake about the way to pull? I think in preparation he not thinking. He like regularly trying to do and only in all match he like I do
SPEAKER_00: He's not ready for that, you know. I see he's not ready. Okay, okay, I understand. But were you surprised that the match was so quick? Yeah, surprised for... You were just maybe thinking of war, like here at least. Oh, it is quick, Jerry win? Yes, it is be surprised, but not surprised for Jerry win. Every time... You said that Jerry is going to win.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yeah. I remember you said that Jerry is bad for style. You are very smart guy and you are not overconfident. You, you beat everyone, but you still like very smart and calculated, you know, like what to do. You don't underestimate, you know? Um, yeah. And so another match, this is very interesting. I went to Moldova for the WAP Wars and I saw Georgii Svetko. Georgii was like a bull, you know, his trapezoid, everything, arms. He was like a bull.
SPEAKER_03: and and then i said georgie is gonna beat kalinchenko and then only yesterday or two days ago kalinchenko shared the video on instagram i don't know if you saw or not from the mirror he was just showing his arm i mean like he i mean i've never seen him like this
SPEAKER_03: And then I got kind of confused about his shape. So I don't know who's going to win this match, but let me see if his thing is still there. Maybe he was in one second. I'll show you. Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. There is one of them that, I mean, his arms, everything was so. I really like Kalinichenko. He's like. Look at his arm. Yeah, yeah. Look at. Huge, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know what's happening. I like Kalinshenko because he's a professional athlete. He's always trying very hard and good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's professional. He respects the job he's doing. He does not like part-time, but with his whole heart.
SPEAKER_00: uh pool on tournament i see i see how how he uh doing a big job for this tournament because hands and muscles i i see i i can see when i see upload i see he on preparation he uh uh training hard or not not
SPEAKER_00: know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and who's winning this match you think i don't know both top role and very dangerous yeah uh uh threat goes top roll is very very strong maybe he thinks he uh carly chambers wrist but i don't know
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that if the match is like this and then maybe Kalnyshenko can even press? Yes, yes. I think 60 or 40, 60 for Tretko, 44. Okay, okay. And another match is between Nugo and John was going to be.
SPEAKER_03: And John didn't recover good after the match. It was a very hard match. What did you think about that match, John versus Leonidas match? Oh, no. The guy is an arm-wrestling machine, right? Even he's in that position, he knows how to win. Very emotional match, very good match. And time to time, John is...
SPEAKER_00: He's really a warrior, you know? Yeah. Always he... Always he... He beat in last... If he has 1% strength, he pulls. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I'm aware of.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah. I mean, just imagine that this guy is 60 years old, Levan. I guarantee you, Levan, when you are 60 years old. My father is sitting here, he's 16 years old. Levan, I guarantee you, when you are 60, when you are 60, you will not be top 10. I guarantee you. No, no. It is too much for me, no.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah. But whenever this guy is 60, you remember how he's matched with Irakli. You remember how he was with Petrenko. Even if he loses, 60 years old man giving, and imagine Levan, this guy from 1980 to today, talking about almost 45 years.
SPEAKER_03: Imagine how much pressure this guy had. This guy was like a 90-kilo guy, 95-kilo guy. He was competing with Richard Lapkus, Cleve Dean, Gary Goodrich, Alan Karev, Denis Siplenko, Pushkar. Imagine how much pressure he had. His shoulder, his arm. Just imagine 45 years. 45 years. And how healthy he can be. I have big interest to see his tendons.
SPEAKER_03: I will tell you something, Levan, you believe or not, in my opinion, he couldn't beat you in his best. But trust me, all the other guys, he would find, even just like Laletin would take his wrist, I'm sure he would find a way to arm wrestle. He would arm wrestle, especially the guys in his category. If this guy was just, say, 2006, don't go so early, 42 years old,
SPEAKER_03: The guys in 105 category, he would literally kill them. Trust me. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so I was going to talk about he got hurt. He didn't recover good. And we said Rob Vision Jr. And we see Nugo. Nugo is not really big guy, not a super tall guy, but very strong. How do you see this match?
SPEAKER_00: Nugo has a very strong heart. I think Nugo will crush him. Crush him like nothing? For nothing, I don't know, but he will beat him. He will beat him, you say. Let's see how it will be. I know how hard he is training for this match, how big of a motivation he has.
SPEAKER_03: I think he will win. He's crazy. He's crazy. Crazy guy is always very strong. You're right. You're right. You're right, yeah. And what was I going to say? Kamil Yablonski versus Corey West. Did you see Corey West against Travis? Corey West in the past looked a little bit like...
SPEAKER_03: Like overweight, you understand? Not so little weight, but now he's still big. But I saw him, whenever I look at him, he was like more like with shoulder and legs. You can see visible that he's still big, but more muscular and less fat. And do you think that, do you think that he has chance against Kamil?
SPEAKER_03: For me, favorite is Kamil. See, like whenever, whenever you're pulling against Laletin, I mean, Laletin is specialist about like taking somebody's wrist, but Kamil doesn't care about that, you know, like Jerry, he doesn't. So what I'm just saying that if Kamil and Corey pulling, Kamil would take Corey's wrist. You understand? But here,
SPEAKER_03: is someone that is given the risk already. So do you think that Corey may be like this way possibly stronger or because he's also big, heavy with a quick start, do you think there is a chance or? No. My money on Kamil. I think Kamil. Your money is on Kamil. Okay. We will see. We will see. Corey is very good.
SPEAKER_03: But Kamel's technique is very, how is it? The same as Jerry, unorthodox. Very, very hard to, I mean, I will tell you my opinion, you know, it is like very hard technique to deal.
SPEAKER_03: in my opinion to beat these guys you know as i said you know you need to really like people just tries to go away more you go away more they put their shoulder behind you know i i think the way that uh matushenko pulls they just hold and they call the pronator and then they go like this like their palm faces up like this and i don't know last time when i see um
SPEAKER_00: uh camille's match i think about some maybe we need to change some rules in our wrestling because uh when we start him and referee say wrist wrist if i give you wrist
SPEAKER_03: it is it is not not not i think no no this is this is not allowed this is not allowed i i think one time they made this mistake when the match starts it needs to be straight it cannot be like this and it cannot be like this it needs to be straight because when you make this when you make this looks like your hand is in the center but your arm is already in winning position so it needs to be this because if i need i need to
SPEAKER_00: for me, comfort to do this. For me, it is like my moving is starting, you know? For me, it is like who will put biceps like this? I'm thinking about it.
SPEAKER_03: People are talking about your wrist when you do this and this, how big it is, like thick. Oh, yeah. Huge, huge. Can I ask you something, Levan? When you went to Japan, did you have any small training with Kanai? When I come in Japan... Before you go, you had a training in Georgii. You had training and then you went to Japan.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I have some practice in Georgii after I go. And I practice with all the Japanese guys who will be there. And after Khanna is coming and the Federation president says, okay, now we go to the Stena Regulatory.
SPEAKER_00: They want to like a tournament. Me and Saneif win that, you know? Nah, come on. Yeah. And I say, what? Because I remember right before you go there, you had like a few hours training with the Georgii guys, right? With Bacho, Irakli and other guys. Yeah. No, no, I cannot pull and how I pull...
SPEAKER_00: I have a contract and if I don't have a contract, you know, I pull like 20 guys here and after he comes in. How is it working? And if he comes in when I pull with those guys, no problem. For training, for training.
SPEAKER_00: And he come in when I'm very tired and I finish. So you didn't train? No. Okay, I understand. I train some, I don't know, with girls and boys and everyone. Yeah, I saw, I saw. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, everything. What did you think about Devon versus Chen Xiao? Do you still think that Devon is as strong as when he pulled against you? I don't like that. I don't like that much. I've been, I say on my heart, you know, I don't like that much because too much. Too much drama? Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And I don't believe they won't lose. No, he didn't lose, but he lost on fouls. But I can see that his arm was stretching here. But of course, he's not ready. He didn't come there the way that he will come there for Petrenko. But in my opinion, Levan...
SPEAKER_03: i don't think that like he can be at this category he can be as strong as when he pull against you if he would be as strong as when he pull you then he would be probably even the super heavyweights you know but uh um yeah so if he pulled now with petrenko maybe maybe five maximum
SPEAKER_00: 10 percent he will be um how is it he will be i i give him like a 60 percent but not 60 not 50 60 60. to devon yeah not more you're talking about the the shape that he was in orlando no no no no no no no no okay okay because in the way that he was in orlando patrick would kill him
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, he would kill him for sure. But you are saying that when he comes in a very well shape, very good shape, so you are saying 60% Devon, 40% Petrenko. Because for him it is very, very low weight, you know, very, very low weight. Yeah, he's almost two meters, you know, just like very tall guy. Very skinny guy.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Henry is asking you, will Lewand train to be fast to take him off center? Will you train for Jerry to be fast to take the center off? Like speed? No. Huh? No. So you are saying that this is mostly about the power? Yeah. I understand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: yeah that that's incredible we will see many many many we talked about the we talked about the this month's king of the table and there is one guy do you know the guy the korean hulk the guy from korea yeah he's gonna pull it with uh alan and i think this guy is like 165 something or something but he's just huge to the side way you know and the island is the opposite way you know and but i think
SPEAKER_03: I think they will share the video that he and Michael had a match that he won a little bit trouble. Michael years ago at the Arnold Classic, or I'm mistaken, I don't know. I mean, if the guy is that strong, then Aldo may be in trouble. I see he has big, big biceps, you know, but he has a very small hand, and I think it is a big problem for him. So you are thinking Aldo will beat him? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think, yeah. Okay. We will see. We will see. We will see how it will be. And I don't want to talk about the East versus West. Right now, we need to focus on the king of the table. But one match is already announced. We can talk about that shortly. What do you think about Ivan Matyushenko versus Ali Canmurado match?
SPEAKER_00: I respect both of athletes, very good athletes, very good persons. I feel like I feel Alizhan is preferred in that match. Maybe Matyushenko can fast
SPEAKER_00: going in the hook, but I don't see how he finished. I think Aljan can stop him in the after-ring. So you are saying that probably Matyushenko will be faster? Yeah, faster, but I see he faster, but he cannot finish. So you think it's going to be a long match?
SPEAKER_03: And Ali Can is going to win. Or do you think that Ali Can is going to just stop him and then boom, fast win? For me, not been surprised if he fast win. That's interesting. That's interesting. That's interesting because, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: There has been times that during the practice, even that... You know my... No, I understand. It is very hard because these two guys are, when you talk about 115 kilo Levan, these two guys are just, there is like right here, like there is nothing more. With left arm, like it is incredible. There is nothing you can think better than these guys in that category.
SPEAKER_03: and it is very very hard to uh have prediction and yeah we will see one last question without mentioning any match or something what do you think about this i don't know i think i asked you this before but i don't remember your answer do you think that there is a possibility this guy to be dangerous yeah he's doing i think he's already dangerous right he's already dangerous
SPEAKER_00: We are talking about that much with my friend Lasha. You know Lasha? Lasha, yeah, yeah. When is he going to pull? When is he going to compete? Train this guy. Maybe, maybe, listen, listen, train this guy and apply for visa maybe in America. I say maybe people with the coach, right?
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Today we talk about this match and he will say Dzeranov will win. I say Vitalii will win and we talk about this. So if you had a match in December against Dzeranov, would you take him very seriously? Yeah, yeah. After a match with Vitalii. What he did to Ravas?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, after that match with Rewaz, he's very dangerous. He's very strong. And before that, he beat Ferit. Yeah. Why he's very dangerous? Because I see his progress. Progress, yeah, yeah, yeah. And listen, I sit here during the press conference, I look at him,
SPEAKER_03: his shoulders like you put that ball there you know in the bicep just like you just and he's like you know even like when he talks he talks like you know like a caveman you know he's like he's just like you know he's like ready to break your bones you know whenever you touch him he's very solid man you you feel like you you touch into wall or something you're just like very heavy guy you know like
SPEAKER_00: When I say heavy, I'm not talking about the scale. He doesn't move, you know. You just put his shoulder, you think that you're hitting the wall. It's very, very hard because to make that form, if you're not training a very long time and very hard, it's not possible. Yeah, yeah. To be in that shape, yeah. So you say that your friends, Samushia,
SPEAKER_03: Lasha, there is a possibility that he's training sometimes or not at all? He's training, yeah. For armwrestling as well? Yeah, he's a 12-time Georgii champion. In armwrestling? Yeah. I thought he was a strongman.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, Lasha is not. Oh, you're talking about the Paralympic guy? No, no, who is in my corner every time, you know? Oh, okay. I'm not talking about, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm talking about, what's the big guy's name? It's Konstantin, yes. Oh, you're Konstantin. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, my friend. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, if Lasha is saying that opinion about this, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: I take it more seriously because you know Armwrestling very well and Lasha also knows Armwrestling very well. The guy is a very smart guy. He's saying Dzeranov can stop Vitalii and after he stops him Vitalii not has a chance. It depends on which position. Can he still do that if it is like this or if it is like
SPEAKER_03: Maybe if not like this, but like this maybe. Yeah, like the risers is going like this. Like Hermes. Hermes, yeah. Yes. We will see. We will see how we do. There are a few superchats. I will read it. We can finish. Rajan Devangan. One second.
SPEAKER_03: He says, Engin, how is your health now? I'm fine, my friend. Thank you. I hope to watch you arm wrestling again at top level. If anyone can beat Samushia, it is you, I think. Levan, what do you think about Jerry's potential against you? What's this? I say one, only one. I trained very hard and after
SPEAKER_03: So you are saying that he is very dangerous, but you are training so hard that he will not be dangerous. Devon is here. Where is Devon? Yeah, Devon Larratt. Devon legend. Thank you, Devon. You too. Legend. Okay. And DB Talks.
SPEAKER_03: Engin, would you consider holding an East versus West tournament with Levan, Devon Ermes and the other top 10 super heavyweights to see who wins in the end? My friend, there is no professional support that is like boxing or MMA as of today that you do tournament. Because the problem with the tournament is that when you have a tournament, like the draw,
SPEAKER_03: really is important two guys may have 30 40 seconds match and then one guy beats the other one so quick in round one and when you go to the round two you will have a match with one guy that pulled half minutes only five minutes ago the other guy pulled only two seconds half minutes ago so it really makes difference so if you want yeah that's a tournament is very good but it is very very hard to say sometimes the tournament always
SPEAKER_03: shows the the best guy so that that is why we try to do one-on-one matches yeah and I think I saw one more Archie Barber Archie Barber says one second uh question for Levan will you do a video with Brian Shaw as Devon did you will do a video with Brian Shaw do you know what we should do
SPEAKER_03: Levan, if you go to America for the Jerry match, I think you need to buy your tickets a little bit late. You understand? Come back maybe one week later. And then maybe you should meet with Brian Shaw and then you guys do some training together and maybe some other people. It would be good, I think. Yeah. Good idea.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Brian is very strong and I'm very happy that he has an interest in armwrestling. Kirill Sarichev has been in Georgii 10 days, two weeks ago, and he's coming on training and he's very strong. He's strong? Yes, he's very strong. I really like his progress.
SPEAKER_00: I can say 100% he can pull. And I'm very happy to see new faces. Yes, I agree. Like Brian or Kirill or something, big names in world sport. Yeah, it's very good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Anyways, Levan, my friend, I don't want to take your time more. Thank you very much for, again, being our guest. And it is good that time to time you connect with the community this way, and then people hear how you are and what is the progress. And thank you very much. Is there anything you want to say to the community or anything? Yeah, thank you for so much.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you for support. I cannot write to everyone and thank you all guys for supporting me and support armwrestling. I can say I do my
SPEAKER_00: best what i can for being in december in best shape and and win that much yeah and i really hope and i can i want to say good luck for jerry for his preparation and i hope he will be he will be in his best shape shape in december and we make very good uh
SPEAKER_03: historical match in that wrestling, yeah. Levan, Levan, you just said that you will do your best to finish him quick. Now you say you hope that he is in good shape and it will be a historical match. Come on. When I think him very fast, it will be a very historical match.
