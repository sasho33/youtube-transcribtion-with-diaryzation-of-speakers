SPEAKER_02: Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Let me see with my phone or turn it one second. Let me see how let's, I think it's sideways. We need to do, but just wait one second, please. Um,
SPEAKER_02: One second. Yeah. I think that the problem right now will be that it will not show us at the same time. There is a way to fix it, but I think it will be better if you do it sideways. But it will just show us once at a time. If there is anyone who knows how to fix this, to put us together in the same screen, then please let us know because I don't know how to do it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So I'm out for a walk. You will be walking or sitting?
SPEAKER_01: i'll be walking if if if the reception is normally pretty good in in uh in my town if it gets crazy if if the reception isn't working i can go back home and uh and i'll do i have to do cardio engen i have i have to i have to keep doing cardio now so yeah so i i need to move hey buddy thank you thank you
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I have to keep active. Yeah. How much do you need to lose? Oh, God. It's going to be a good one. It's going to be a good one. This will be the biggest cut I've ever done. So what are you right now? You don't want to say? You want to keep it secret? You want to make people curious? Well, you know,
SPEAKER_01: There is a lot of truth inside me, Engen, but there's also a lot of lies, okay? Yeah, but the lies are not to deceive people, not to hurt people, but just to make people curious, make the things more exciting. I am probably... Well, I don't think me lying about my weight ever hurts anybody. I don't think I've ever hurt anybody. Yeah, it would only make Petrenko nervous, probably. Well, I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I don't even know why I've done it in the past and...
SPEAKER_02: I might be doing it now, but I will truthfully tell you, this will be the biggest cut of my life and it will not be an easy one. You will make it, you think? Of course I'll make it. Oh, you will make it? Of course I'll make it. Okay, then whatever you can say right now after you say you're going to make it, then whatever way you say, people will know. But who knows, maybe the way that you say you're going to make it may be a lie too. Who knows? No, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, then your weight doesn't matter anymore. Exactly. Because you said you're going to make it. I will make the weight. I will make the weight. That's all the people need to know. And you will be... How confident are you? Are you as confident as you portray on your channel that his hand is small and this and that? Ole Petrenko is a great champion. An incredible champion. But...
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to win. I will win. Yeah. You will win. Yeah. I will win. Do you remember what was your weight when you a little bit trained before on Garber's match with on Garber in, in Malaysia? Uh, what year was that? That was 2019. 19. Was it 19? Yeah. No, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, no, that wasn't 19. Was it? It was true because the 2019 is the only, only top eight happened that year happened then. And you, you pull him when he was gonna pull in, in Malaysia, probably against Levan before Levan match his match. Are you sure it was 2019? It wasn't 2018. No, 2018. There was no top eight. Um, I wasn't, I wasn't a heavy at that time.
SPEAKER_01: I was probably in the, not even probably more like probably two 55, but I have a feeling and, and my, and in my memory is not good with a lot of things. I have a feeling that was I coming from Australia? Maybe I think I was in Australia or maybe not. My memory is terrible, but I know that I wasn't really big, maybe two 55. Yeah. Because, because.
SPEAKER_02: I think Ongarbe told me he was like 97 kilos and he beat you.
SPEAKER_01: that day okay when we when we pulled on the practice table okay practice table we pulled it we pulled on a on a weight bench in in the in the gym like it was like two or three two or three days before the competition first thing he said that he left time you were better right time he was better but i i don't know how serious it was but okay so so i will tell you that i love kurda galley on grabayev
SPEAKER_01: I think that he is, when I think about table IQ and just technique, okay? Not talking about power or strength. For me, he's one of the very, very, very best. The technical wins, I've seen him pull off. The guy's much bigger than him. I've seen him beat. For me, he's one of my very favorite arm wrestlers.
SPEAKER_01: When I, I was, I think it was Magdan and him, a couple of guys from the Kazakh team were in the gym. I was in there training. I was surprised. I was surprised just a couple of days before. What's that? You were surprised that he was even trying to do something before his match, you know? Yeah. That's, that's what I thought. Okay. So, and I, and I was a bit concerned. Okay. Now I think he was in a place mentally where he,
SPEAKER_01: He was just about to compete and, um, and I didn't really want to fight with them too much, but yeah, right-handed he was controlling me and left-hand, which was the not important hand. Right. He wasn't competing left. I think I would, but, but I would be safe. I would say that at that time, a super match between the two of us would have been great. Really good. You mean you and him? Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: so what i'm just saying that right now years later ongarbe 105 pulling petrenko and petronko is not even feeling him how would you yeah no no no no would you explain this as there was only a practice and you were not ready why along that was ready for the super match yeah and it's more than that i think for him he was in a look at three days before a match
SPEAKER_01: There's no way I'm exposing myself to any failure. Okay. That's the way that I would be, you know, you wouldn't really want to give your all to someone who's going to pull in three days. Absolutely. I think that would be, I don't think that that would be, would have been a good thing for me to do, but at the same time, I'll tell you like,
SPEAKER_01: I didn't, I maybe didn't give my absolute all and, and he maybe didn't either, but this was a table, like, this is more of like a practice kind of, this was the first time that I'd actually sat down with Kurtigalli and I'm a, I'm such a big fan. Really. I was so happy to meet Kurtigalli and sit with him. We sat that event and we, we made bets with each other the whole day.
SPEAKER_02: Um, I, I, uh, last thing I want to do is mess up his event. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Of course. Of course. But I'll tell you, I'll tell you we're close. We're close. You are saying that even you guys would seriously pull at the table, it would be close. Close. Okay. Can I ask you this now that at that time you are saying you were like 115 kilos to 5,500. Yeah, I think so. I think so. Now you will be about the.
SPEAKER_02: Same weight, probably after the weigh-in. I don't know how you guys can do that. We'll see how it goes, but that would be my hope. Your hope? Yeah, okay. I hope that I can do that, yeah. Okay, the question is, how much, like, what weight do you want to be right before the last week's water cuts? I think that the perfect place to, the thing is, look it,
SPEAKER_01: Hang in? Yeah. Nothing ever goes according to plan. Hmm. But, but, but what is the plan? Yeah, I know that part. But what is the plan? The plan is not what's happening. The plan was for me to be 256 at night. Before this border cut. So you plan to lose 25 pounds in the border? That was my plan
SPEAKER_01: long ago long ago there have been there have been extenuating circumstances i have rebounded better than i could have possibly expected um and the weight is i am growing like i am like i put on i was so
SPEAKER_02: the end of so i pulled levan i was like 263 or 264. okay i need to cut you how is it possible that you pulled hermes you were eating like crazy you were 262 264 and then you were like getting big for levan and now you are trying to you were down to like 230s and now you have a 231 pound match
SPEAKER_01: And now you are even bigger than the time that you had a superhero with me. How is it possible? I'm bigger than when I pulled LaVon. Okay. Why is that? There's a lot of factors. Okay. There's a lot of factors. I can explain them in a vague sense to you, but this is, you know, a professional and adult discussion. Um, I'll say that, but, but I'll tell you so that everyone can understand.
SPEAKER_01: Um, that I went very, very hard to, to try and become the super heavyweight world champion. I went very, very, very hard. Um, the first time I took a small pause, small pause, and then I went right back to it, you know? Uh, and basically it was a four year run.
SPEAKER_01: where i just i had that goal in mind and i pushed and i pushed and i pushed and by the end it just uh it was beyond my capabilities you know and and there was very little i could do to uh to keep my body moving forward you can call it you can call it burnout you can call it
SPEAKER_02: Uh, making a lot of, you can call it making a lot of mistakes, a lot of mistakes. Uh, you know, Can you say that your cells were tired and when you did the water cuts that the water fasting and everything, your body get rested and now it's responding better? Absolutely. Yeah. Okay. I went down, hang on, I went down to 229.
SPEAKER_01: At the end of my fast, I was 229 and super weak, super, super weak. And then when the chance match came up, I was like 238, like 238 or so. And even when I pulled chance, I was just starting.
SPEAKER_01: to wake up, but, but so the, the chance match, what was that? That was the 10th of August, I think. So 10th of 10th of August, I weighed two 38 for competition. Okay. 10th of August. Now the end of September, no. When was it? Yeah. The end of September I pulled Leonidas. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I came home on the second of October, one month from the event. I weighed 273. Oh, 273, yeah. I don't understand how this is happening that you have a super match and you are saying, as of this morning, are you bigger than the Levan match?
SPEAKER_02: I'm right, right there. I'm pretty close to that. Pretty close. And the thing is, and the thing is, is I'm hungry. Oh, you're hungry. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Is there anything I will just go straight forward, ask you like, did, did Petrenko concern you so much that you felt like you had to gain weight to get bigger? This is a world title.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. He's the student of Pushkar. Yes. He's incredible. Yes. I have so much respect for anyone who holds a world title at East versus West. He's the best. Yeah. He's the best. He is excellence. He's excellence. Yeah. Okay. For me to think that I can just walk into a match and not be my best would be foolish. Okay. This is a world title shot against the best in the world in this modern era.
SPEAKER_02: this time in our sport. It's not easy. I have to be- It's very, very hard. But a lot of people thought that the person who stopped Levan will not even feel Petrenko, Devon shouldn't be concerned. And so like yesterday, yesterday, Travis told me that, like, you're going to lose 30% of your power. And I don't think that- Travis still thinks- Between the heavyweight to the super heavyweight, I don't think there is 30%
SPEAKER_02: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm just saying that like the strength level, even if it is 5%, you can kill someone at the arm wrestling, but just say that between Levan and Petrenko, you'll say 25% or 20% yet, but, but not every super heavyweight is 25% stronger than, uh, Petrenko. And the question is to you, what is your estimation? Like, like,
SPEAKER_01: How close can you be to your super heavy weight, no diet shape, and no weight loss shape when you make 105 in the next day, next evening? Where do you hope to be? Shape is hard to describe, as you know. There's a lot of factors that come into... From now to that time, right? Between that time, yeah. There's a lot of factors that describe how good a person is on the table, and it
SPEAKER_01: It's hard to measure exactly. Now, I will tell you, I keep track of everything, okay? I keep very close track of how strong I am in the gym and roughly how I feel on the table. So you are the same as the Levan match with the weights right now? No. A little bit lower? Yes. Okay. Probably, probably, probably, I'm probably about 80%.
SPEAKER_01: Are you serious? No. How is it possible that you are almost the same weight, that big, you know? You ain't never been bigger. And let me tell you some more. Let me tell you some more. The thing is, and I also believe, and you can ask people who are close to me, ask people like on the high hookers. You can ask Auden who trains with me all the time. I think...
SPEAKER_02: right now because it all doesn't always line up exactly yeah i think i i am much stronger than my weights suggest okay so you are saying that i i think that at that time you were doing so regular uh training with the gym now i will see you more at the table so we can say that
SPEAKER_02: you are more transferred to the table than the waist. So if you are 80% with the waist, because you don't do those regularly, but you do the table, so you are probably at least 85 to 90 at the table. We can say that? I think so. I think so. You know, listen, Auden, okay, who follows me very closely, he actually thinks that I'm quite possibly comparable to my Levon form right now. Are you at the table? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay. I, I, uh, I dunno, hanging. I feel, I feel very good. This, the truth is, this is where I should be. Like if I was just to be a really healthy guy, this is probably like to be, to walk around like two 55 to 60 and to cut down a tooth. It's probably my best category. Probably if I can retain, if I can retain most of my weight, that makes me very dangerous at one Oh five.
SPEAKER_02: But we still do not know what you are going to lose in that. Right. And even now you are saying that you are hungry. You are hungry. I don't know if you're losing anything right now or if you are gaining anything. I don't think that while you're losing the weight, you will gain a lot. But the last one week, when you lose, just say 20 pounds or more, because you are saying that you are around 265. And more. Or more. Yeah, more for sure. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: and i i kind of believe that you won't be able to make the weight oh come on no you won't be able to make the weight if you are more than 120 kilo as of now listen listen listen listen and why do you doubt me why do you tell me i doubt you because it is it is like if you were i believe that you can lose like 20 pounds water which is like 90 20 pounds yes but how are you going to lose
SPEAKER_02: 14 or 15 or more pounds from what like are you going to are you telling me that you're going to lose like seven kilo fat in in one week and then another 10 kilo uh for water I mean all you will lose will be water you will lose maybe two three kilo fat so what it means that you need to lose about 30 pounds of water it's very difficult because you see when I say I'm hungry
SPEAKER_01: I'm already in a carb depleted state. Okay. I already have lost my weight from glycogen. So yeah, it's going to be a tough cut, but Engin, I love suffering. Okay. I can do it. I will happily happily do it. The big question is not, can I make it because I'm going to make it and I will make it. Um, it's the big question for me is how do I recover?
SPEAKER_01: That's the big question for me. And how much do you lose during that time? Right. It's brand new for me. Back in the WAL, I was doing it from like... I was making a 225-pound class from 248, but I was 248 full. It wasn't 248 hungry. It was a carb-loaded 248. So, yeah, this is going to be...
SPEAKER_01: This will be challenging, but I think I'm completely up to the task and I think I will show complete professionalism throughout. And I'm so happy, like I'm so grateful.
SPEAKER_01: for the place I'm in in my life. I'm doing something that I love to do. And hey, thank you for the opportunity. I get to face the guy who I truly believe is the very best. I think he's the very, very best. So for me to face him, this is what I want to do with my life. I'm very happy about it.
SPEAKER_01: I will show up a demon on that table. I will be so fierce and I will fight him. I will take home the world title back to Canada. And what is the, what is the, uh, chance do you think that your opponent has to beat you? Um, it will be a tremendous fight. There's no doubt in my mind.
SPEAKER_01: I do not question his strength, his will, the meaningful for the, the meaning of this match to him is just as significant. If I want that title, I want that third crown very badly. And I understand that this match is so significant, not just because it's a world title. It has great meaning, um, because of his teacher, you know, uh, and I am sure.
SPEAKER_02: he thinks about that i'm sure he's watched that and i'm sure that there is a part of him that wants to avenge that loss yeah yeah i mean i think it is more meaningful for him than it is for you i'm 100 sure of that and and i i like with this side of the world uh devon we have been competing for
SPEAKER_02: 30 years, more than 30 years, and then we see WAF, and then everyone wins, and then they shake hands. But whenever you held Pushkar, and it was something, a new experience for this side of the world. You understand? And I'm 100% sure many people didn't like that from this side. But of course, with the more right now we have East-West Kingo table, more of these things are getting a little bit more used to.
SPEAKER_02: and and but i'm 100 sure that for petrenko this match probably is the most important match of his life not because only he's pulling against you but because also something the the match that you had with uh pushcard that surprised the world you know at that time and i'm aware of that so in no way in my mind do i think that this is going to be an easy match uh in no way do i see my
SPEAKER_01: chances sometimes i have matches where i'm like i'm gonna kill this guy um i i view it as highly contested um i give myself like a between a 53 and a 56 chance of victory but that's all i need that's that's all i need so you has that that big chance like like 54 to 50 sorry 44 i do believe i'm the favorite
SPEAKER_01: I do. That's okay, but he still has a little bit over 40% chance. So you are saying that it is not out of possibility. It's funny even to talk about. Yeah, of course. I mean, this guy is the best. He's the current world title holder. He destroyed in his last few matches. He's been so dominant. It's clear to me.
SPEAKER_01: You know, what are my advantages? Hand size, arm length experience. What are his advantages? Explosiveness, strength, youth. You know, it's, it's a great match. I think that if the match stops, I hope that my endurance will carry through after the cut. This will be important for me. There's a lot of very vital steps. I'm I'm the match has already started for me. I'm already in this process.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I'm out here walking. I it's all it's my life has become so simple. I am like a monk. Okay. Everything revolves around the 2nd of November, probably around midnight in Turkey. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yesterday we were talking about with, uh, talking with, uh, uh, with, um, thank you very much. Yeah. She says happy birthday. Anyway. So I think your birthday. Yeah. I don't even really celebrate, you know, it's just another year. Oh, you 70, 71 now. Now, now you look about, you look about a good 38 with your new hair.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but I need to shave as well. I went to South Korea and my sleeping order is just messed up. I go to bed different times, get up anyway, so I will be okay, I hope. Anyway, I was going to ask you something. Yeah, I forgot that we talked about something else. Yesterday, I was talking with Neil Pickup and Neil said that you were discussing with him. Thank you, Phil Goody. Thank you, my friend.
SPEAKER_02: And he says, happy birthday. No limits. Bring in the cosmic punch.
SPEAKER_02: anyways um so he said that he thinks that you need to have the center and then put him to the b side right away while he said that you you think that you know you need to stop him with the open arm top roll first and then and then uh wear him out and then and then beat him i like i am not sure like how strong he will be because right now i'm getting
SPEAKER_02: confusing information from you. From one side, you are 80% with the weight and you still have to lose like at least 35 pounds. And then it is like probably that
SPEAKER_02: will also bring your power a little bit down, whatever you are. And then from other side, you are saying that your teammates are saying that you are feeling almost as strong as you were at the Levan match. And then, so I really do not know where you are and I really do not know how you will lose the weight. And if you lose the weight, how much you will lose power, how much you will recover. And I really don't know, but I know one thing that
SPEAKER_02: Petrenko is very strong at the center. Right at the center, he is very strong. You remember that the matches, the training matches with Dadikyan and Denis that Dadikyan was always taking him to do very near to the pad and then Denis could do something from there. But if you realize it, I think as far as I remember, Petrenko never lost the center to
SPEAKER_02: And Tata Ching, who has incredible side pressure. As far as I remember, Dadikyan was the aggressor at the start, at the center. So I'm not sure. That is just my opinion. But the center, fighting center, I don't know how good idea it is. But can you also tell your opinion about this? Yeah. I talk to Neil a lot. He's a great guy to bounce ideas off of in training. I mean,
SPEAKER_01: Uh, we did talk yesterday. I think it was yesterday or the day before. Um, I try to make my planning as accurate and precise as possible. Um, and I do not like to plan for things that I don't think are reality. Um, I believe that hook it. If I was able to do what Neil is asking me, it's not a match.
SPEAKER_01: If I pull Petrenko off center on the go, it's going to be a very long and bad day for him. Now, what I believe is much more likely
SPEAKER_01: is it's a close match and in a close match, I would likely, it's no secret. Like this is not a secret. I will try to secure the hand position and I will likely give away the center a little bit. This is very, this is very likely if, and the thing is, is in my mind, the most likely scenario is he controls center. At some point I take the hand. The real question is,
SPEAKER_01: Do I stop him? And where do I stop him? If that match stops close to the center, it's going to be a terrible day, terrible day for him. The more likely option is that he gets me quite far. Maybe he beats me the first time.
SPEAKER_01: um but i will continue to chip away at that wrist this is this is what i plan for because to me this is this optimizes my chances for success if i plan on just destroying them well that's just to me this is overestimating my my uh my strength coming in i think more likely it's close and in a close war this is my best chance for victory
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I think that'd be great. Look, if I could do what John did, that would be great. John is different from me. John has... No, no, no, no, no. You and John Burzing match. First round of you and John Burzing match. Yeah, I kind of think that it is going there, but...
SPEAKER_02: Petrenko may have more horsepower and better wrists. People talk about how Petrenko lost to John and how you beat John and how can Petrenko have a chance, but Petrenko and this Petrenko are not the same Petrenko. There is no need to deceive us. It doesn't mean that Petrenko will beat you or not, but it's not the same Petrenko. John and I aren't the same either. When John's really good,
SPEAKER_01: He has much more risk control this way than I do. Yeah. I get opened up on my arm and I fight with pronation. Typically like John has pronation in his game as well. Yeah. John normally doesn't give away his wrist flexion. Yeah. So it's, it's, it's a good reference point. Like John and I is a good reference point. Um, I think that.
SPEAKER_01: also i think that uh there's a little bit a little bit of similarity with myself and prudnik a little bit but i know that prudnik is more of a hook guy and petranco is more of a top roller that's what i think but yeah and i i do believe i do believe that i will win i do believe i'll i'll come ahead and uh
SPEAKER_01: I'm really excited about it. My mental state is perfect. You know, one thing I'd add to this whole numbers and weight and weigh in is I have to talk about there's something else that goes on in the body, which is interesting to measure. You know, sometimes when you're in your training, you're kind of flat.
SPEAKER_01: But, but right now I'm in a part of my training where I'm just getting much stronger, very, very quickly. So, so everything that I'm doing, I feel like every day I, I, I don't like, I don't have a lot of tendonitis. Like normally when I do this, I can feel parts of my elbow. I can feel parts of my wrist. My arm is healthy. And I trained this morning, you know, I'm lit and I'm lifting heavy. So.
SPEAKER_02: Everything is where it should be. And so far in the weight cut, I have not lost any strength. I've continued to become stronger. What weight loss are you talking about? What weight loss are you talking about? Did you even lose weight? I was 273. I was 273 pounds. And then you're talking about what? Five pounds loss? Like what do you expect from five pounds? You have another like 37 pounds or something as far as I understand.
SPEAKER_02: you're talking about you didn't lose power from the five pounds while we have like and you know that every pounds that you lose next one will be harder it will not go any easier it will be harder and harder so that that part i disagree about like losing power in five pounds it's normal you know i'm sure that you are right now losing only fat you know not so much water yet you know imagine there's a pond imagine there is a pond
SPEAKER_01: And it's filled with water and there's fish in there. There's turtles in there. Okay. And over the course of only one day or maybe a day and a half, almost all of the water is pulled out. It's pulled out of the pond, almost all of it. So the turtles and the frogs and the fish, they have to survive for only one day.
SPEAKER_01: might be just a little bit of water left for them and and the thing is the next day the pond will be refilled refilled with water and so long as the fish and the tadpoles all live they won't notice a difference on that day the pond will be just as beautiful as it was before the water was emptied you know i just have to make sure that everything stays alive because i will refill and maybe maybe
SPEAKER_02: it won't be that bad maybe it'll just be a nice like a nice rest maybe it'll be like a healthy thing maybe i'll be even stronger because of it do you do you do you think that you said that like your pain is gone is that because of the the uh water fast that you did because i heard that it had some healing healing effects or anything else it's lots of things i mean it's very rarely just one thing
SPEAKER_01: There's a lot of factors that go into my state right now. I have a lot of people who guide me, who assist me. I'm in a place now in my life where I'm able to live much more purely and simply. My life is very simple. And I think it's a direct result of that simplicity
SPEAKER_02: And the help that I have from the people around me that I'm as strong as I am right now. That's good. That is very confusing information from you. Ways to go down, table time, go better, and weight is a lot. I usually can do some calculation, but this is one of the cases that is very complicated to me. But I'm sure that you know what you are doing. It will have to be that way.
SPEAKER_01: if I'm to win. If I'm to win, it will have to be as I described. If it's not, then I will lose. But if what I'm saying is true, then I'll probably come home with the best. Do you know what you are saying is true or you want to believe that, like, you are hoping that it's true? Well, I don't know anything. And I'm actually really, I don't know. I don't know very much. No, no, no. You know, you have so much experience, at least about yourself, you know? Like, nobody knows better than you. I believe...
SPEAKER_02: This is a new case, right? For a new case that you never experienced before, like being 273, cutting to 231 and hoping that, you know, you will lose the weight. Like what was the biggest weight cut in such a short time before? About 23 pounds I did from a lighter weight, right? So I was typically going from 248 down to 225. But that was easy. Very, very, very, very easy.
SPEAKER_01: Um, so this is the biggest cut. This is the biggest one. Um, I think that it's important belief in all things. Belief is so important and the more you can actually, and I have that, I have that belief. If you are healthy, if you are healthy, your body will match with your belief. You know, if you're not healthy, sometimes you cannot do it. Like I lost 20 kilos.
SPEAKER_02: For the Waffles in 2018, 44 pounds I lost, but it wasn't that short time. I lost in two months. But right now, if you ask me to do it, God, no, I don't want to do that. I wouldn't try to do that, yeah. And so I really don't know how you will do it, but yeah, we will see. We will see how it will be. Inshallah.
SPEAKER_02: Inshallah, yeah, yeah, you're right. Yeah. Anyway, so, um, okay. And the question, if you can, if you lose the match, will you give up that category or you will try it? You don't want to think about it. I know, but like, do you have like obsession that you are like, you know, I'm going to get that title or if you just somehow that you fail the weight, because I am sure that
SPEAKER_01: Petrenko is going to pull against you in any way. But I don't think he will accept if you cannot make the weight. So what is your take on this? I don't really want to let those thoughts in my mind too much. But, you know, I have failed many times in my life. All that I could hope for.
SPEAKER_01: is that I were to take the loss as a lesson. That would be my only wish. And somehow from it become both wiser, more experienced and stronger for my next battle. But I do not believe that this will be the case. I see my victory. I see my victory. I see myself, you know, shaking, shaking Petrenko's hand afterwards as we bow to each other.
SPEAKER_01: I see myself holding the belt. I see myself doing something that no other athlete has done yet in East versus West. This will be, this will be for me, this is a tremendous victory and I'm very focused on it. Um, if I was not able to do this, I never liked, even if I were to win,
SPEAKER_01: i do not like to plan necessarily my next step because there is a lot of information that will come from this match through victory or defeat there will be a lot um but by your weight can we say that there is a possibility that we may see you in super heavyweight sooner than because last time i talked with you said about a year later
SPEAKER_02: But whenever now we see that your weight is just pushing you, I kind of feel that this will be the last time you're making 105. Or maybe because of making this weight, maybe it will get easier for the next time. I don't know. I'll say perfect scenario, OK? So my imaginary perfect scenario. My perfect scenario is that I win the match.
SPEAKER_01: Now, I believe that in the 105-kilo class, I do believe that Petrenko is number one. Yes. I believe that there are others. I believe that, you know, guys like Daddycan, guys like Angerbaev, guys like Todd Hutchings, even guys from Leiter, guys like Irakli, guys like – who's Irakli pulling, the tall Russian? George Tadeev. George Tadeev.
SPEAKER_02: right there's guys like this in the lightweight division that could absolutely be worth it for me worth it for me okay okay okay so you know what i mean you are interested but i was just thinking that because you saw 270s and you see i see how much you are suffering to lose that weight or you will be suffering i like to do it because whenever i was losing the weight i was saying never again while i'm losing but maybe maybe you are not there yet since you are very
SPEAKER_02: Close to 270, maybe you will be saying that when you come down to 250 and then trying to lose that water and then you're like, oh, never again, never again. I've been very public.
SPEAKER_01: about my love for the super heavyweight world title. I think that the super heavyweight world title is the biggest prize that we have in the sport. The open, it's open. That means anybody and all the champions, everybody in the back of their head is like when they wanna beat more and more difficult opponents, regardless of your weight. But I have a ton of respect
SPEAKER_01: or the weight categories. And I also understand that not everybody can win in the weight categories. It's difficult. I always say that it might be actually more difficult to actually be the 85 kilo world champion than it is to be the open because at the open weight, a lot of it is by birth.
SPEAKER_02: Like not everybody is born Lavon, not everybody is born Vitaly. There's actually in the open weight division, there's fewer people who can actually do it. But at 85... Maybe the world's population in lighter classes is more than the population in the super heavyweight. So there are like not so many big guys, but smaller guys. But the only thing is that after 150, you have all of them in one group while
SPEAKER_02: The other categories are at the East versus West only 10 kilo, you know, limits from 85 to 95, 75 or 77 to 85. But while when you say over 115, you have guys from 125 to 180 kilo, even up to 200 kilo. Sometimes this is hard, especially for the people, lighter people like you, Hermes, you know, who are barely over 120. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But to win at 85, to win at 95, it might actually be more difficult in a way. Like to win in the lighter categories, it means you are a very, very good arm wrestler. You're not just winning because you were born a giant and you have extreme strength. Like to win at 85, you are a phenomenal, phenomenal arm wrestler.
SPEAKER_01: I respect that. I would continue to face champions from Leiter if I thought it was a worthy challenge. If you found out something that you will never make 209.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, stop it. What do you mean never? Never? Why does the word never exist in your vocabulary? It is because there is never, never. Like Levan will never make 209 as well, you know. So you say the word never, but yet there is always some weird possibility that could exist. I don't know. Let's see. The time will prove one of us right.
SPEAKER_01: The answer. Hey Devon, how long will you rest before the match? Well, certainly. I'd say certainly a week. But in a way, I've already started resting. I stopped doing table time. So I'm already kind of resting. I will probably continue to work heavy maybe up till
SPEAKER_01: maybe 10 days or so and i'll continue to do blood flow until i get on the airplane like uh but i i will show up as perfect as i can be so i will make i will err on the side of caution i will not push heavy lifting to a point where i think i will not be fully recovered um yeah
SPEAKER_02: Jace Larson says, Devon, you are going to define all the odds, and you are the reason I have started training. Thank you for everything you have done. I hope I can meet you at the next King of the Table. Thank you, brother. Thank you. I appreciate your words. And Dino is asking you, Devon, do you know Flintstone? Who? Flintstone? Oh, he says Flintstone. He says, but I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: It's Dino. I can't see the comments right now, but I know Dino and I know what he's talking about. I don't know if you want to open that up on this podcast. It sounds like it's a problematic thing. I don't know how you pronounce this name. C-A-L-E-B.
SPEAKER_02: c-a-l-e-b caleb caleb arm render okay okay yeah that's that's that's the guy who does that thing in the private messages he's a great arm wrestler too but everybody knows him for something else okay an actual 300 pounds devon defeats levan no question he says and and and then guys i cannot somehow i cannot reach to the older um super chess can you
SPEAKER_02: okay can you guys remind me the super chess here because somehow i cannot reach that anyway so let's talk a little bit about the uh the other matches other matches uh my favorite match it is not a world title match but um it's everybody's favorite match it's everybody's favorite match okay okay i think so because like i'm for many reasons okay dino also
SPEAKER_01: Dino says, no, no, devil knows. Wish you all good health. Yeah, I know what you're talking about, Dino. And I'll tell you, watch the event, tune in, because it's going to be a crazy day. Yeah, this much, I'm sure. And you should remind me at the end when we're all done, and we can maybe dive into that just for a second. About the flipstone? Yeah, maybe just remind us at the end if we have time. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_02: One second. Choke on wax. Is it dangerous Michael doing so many PRs this close to their match? You're talking about Michael? Yeah, he's asking us probably or you. I actually called Michael. Auden and I were watching Michael's stuff a couple days ago and we gave him a call.
SPEAKER_02: What a great match. That's the match we're talking about, right? We will talk. In a few minutes, we will talk. But we cannot really teach Michael what to do. But, of course, we all have our opinion. But then when you can answer, what do you think about it? Is it too close, too heavy? Well, look, again, exactly what you said. And I was so torn to even call Michael because Michael is such a champion.
SPEAKER_01: he's he's one of the sport's greatest champions and uh and what i didn't want to do i didn't want to put any doubt in his mind but i i also had this exact same concerns you know his his strength right now is astronaut it's astronomical
SPEAKER_01: Like anybody who practices these lifts understands that what Michael is doing. It's it's I, I don't know if Lavon could do it, but basically he's in a place where nobody's been before. He he's at a level of strength that is completely ludicrous. And, and I know that even where he's at right now, he will even be stronger on that match day.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, if you rest, yes, for sure. I don't think that in the last two weeks, anybody can get stronger by training. And that's what I told him. I said, Mike, I said, at this point, there's a process that's happening. All the lifts that you are doing right now, they're not going to affect. They're really like maybe, maybe, but you're...
SPEAKER_01: There's a fine line now, and he has to be very careful. And you may even get injured. The times that I get injured were the best I felt, you know, because... Right. Yeah. Yes, we both agree. And I think that the arm wrestling world shares the same concerns. And Michael is operating right at that threshold, right at that red line of performance. And I think we all just want to see him show up and win and be in his best shape.
SPEAKER_01: That he clearly is. There is another super chat. Will you face Levan third time in the future? This is far away. There's a lot of time between that would even remotely be a possibility. If somehow I was worthy,
SPEAKER_02: if somehow I was worthy of that. Do you feel like you need to clean the super heavyweight again and then get deserving to pull him again? Do you feel like you need to deserve that by beating some others and say that, listen, I deserve again? Or you want the direct shot whenever you step to? Because from one side, whenever you try to clean everyone,
SPEAKER_02: you are going to do into the same process that you getting tired again because right before you pull the one you pull so many matches so many matches of course you rested but it was only four months from november
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I should say five months to April 11th. Yeah. One, two, three, four, five. Yeah. So five months, but it was like, so such a hard, hard, you know, time, you know, you pull Rudnick and then you pull Sandris, you pull Gennady, you pull Hermes, you pull Denis, and then you pull Georg Estrebedko. And then like, like I think it was a very tiring process, but what's your opinion?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Um, it's difficult to say, you know, um, I think that obviously if I were to go through the super heavyweight division, then, you know, it's obvious that you get a shot. I believe based off of my past, my resume, my, my history with Lavon, that there potentially would be a circumstance, you know, there would be some
SPEAKER_02: would be some opportunity to potentially skip the line a little bit if lavon wanted it if i wanted it if the sport wanted it if we felt it would work like right now when somebody is winning like if petrenko was still the champion if he wanted to pull the uh
SPEAKER_02: 115 world title i would give him that opportunity so when you write 115 kilo everybody knows that if it is matushenko reno or stago like i don't think it would make sense to give the super airways because those guys are not super heavyweight there has they have never been there and i don't think they would even accept that match you understand and as the airway but if you win the heavyweight i think it would give you a direct shot as being the champion of one category below you understand you have been there
SPEAKER_02: And I think that it will be a direct shot if you would ask. But if you just say, let me see myself where I am first, and then you can do that way as well. I'll tell you. So for me, that's incredible. And I would be super thankful and grateful if that ever came up.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, if you really request, I think that you will have that chance because you are the only one that... No, no, that's the truth. It's not like personal thing. I need to be objective. You are one of the few that won the belt permanently and you won super heavyweight belt three times. Three times you won the super heavyweight match. So I think that you deserve that. But it would be good if you would win
SPEAKER_02: 115 kilo title and challenge the one category above as the champion of one category below you know yeah wouldn't that be incredible yeah I mean yeah and I think I wouldn't I wouldn't
SPEAKER_02: I saw you doing some matches against two hands that I remember we had the chat to talk about between us. But I still believe that that is not the way. I still believe that somebody needs to really a little bit control his riser part and then use the pronator to more like the winning side instead of back. That you becoming a bit like vulnerable for the side.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, maybe you think differently, but of course, having an ideal to beat Levan and the reality, what we have to apply may not be well fitting to each other. I can't wait to watch Levan's career. It's incredible. I don't think we've ever had a super heavyweight that's so dominant, especially in this era when he gets given hard match, hard match, hard match,
SPEAKER_01: You know, Lavon is defending the title against the best, um, you know, next up is Jerry. Uh, and, and I think that, uh, a lot of people, you know, are kind of discounting Jerry a little bit. I watched the podcast earlier.
SPEAKER_02: Jerry looks good. He looks good. He said that he will get even bigger. He will be even bigger. All he needs to do, he needs to stay out of injury because we are getting old, 50 years old. And as you know, Jerry was injured three weeks before the Alex match. He doesn't want to have something similar before Levan match. Yes, Alex is incredibly strong, but Levan is something different. You need to have perfect preparation. There is another guy asked you,
SPEAKER_02: Khalid versus Shaw. Brian Shaw, who wins? Shaw. OK. And then ProWin Astrology says, Devon, please be as safe as you can with your cuts. Creating can make you cut more dangerous. If you are using the hot tube method, I urge you to make sure that you have a source of water that is hot enough
SPEAKER_02: beforehand, you know, I mean, I, I, if you want, I can take you to the Turkish bath, you know, we have here, like some of them is very, very, uh, how long will you start doing that? Like, are you gonna do the water cut only by drinking so much water? Like the, those UFC guys are doing, or you will also use a sauna type of thing. I will probably require both, you know, and then you will need a lot of IV, right? Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Um, yeah, that's the plan right now. It look, it's going to be a challenging cut. I, I will obviously do the water portion. I'll do the flush portion. Um, and then I will probably fast. Uh, I'll probably fast. So no water, no food. I'm thinking probably a good 36 to 40 hours. And I think during that last period is when I will do all the sauna and the
SPEAKER_02: and just push out all the water and it's it will be it will be challenging i need to learn that i need to learn that how to do it it's quite simple it's quite simple i i'm just afraid one of my students did that he will not believe he broke his arm yes and then and then the same year at the walls he did again and he also broke his right arm but he was very young yeah 20 20 years
SPEAKER_01: there is a problem with that thing that like yeah yeah I mean no no and you see it in the UFC as well you see a lot of guys break their break their bones in the UFC after difficult cuts it's it it is difficult because
SPEAKER_01: The bone is a lot of water. There's a lot of water in bone, right? So, you know, yes, the cut makes your bones weaker. If you can't rehydrate properly, it is a problem. But it's what makes it more fun, right? We will see. You like fun for sure. You like adrenaline that you are all the time looking. And Frantic, happy birthday again. Say hi to Devon from me.
SPEAKER_02: frantic frantic is a great supporter of arm wrestling oh you know you know these guys oh yeah frantic frantic is a great guy thank you frantic okay okay so let's let's a little bit talk about yeah yeah another thing the brian show versus eddie hall i think that like can i will tell you something it only shows if these people are accepting
SPEAKER_02: to pull in this event, it only shows that we are very near to the mainstream sport level. Yeah, we are very close. Oh, yeah. Brian Shaw.
SPEAKER_02: is terrifying he's terrifying people are going to start to realize this more and more um he asked me a super match and i was just thinking that kirill is already there and brian is just coming
SPEAKER_02: And when I say Kirill is already there, I don't mean that he will not get better, but he is already more into arm wrestling. And Brian Shaw just stated in February, but first he needs to beat Eddie Hall. And right now Eddie is trained by Neil. So if Neil is involved, I would expect surprises, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: There's not enough time. Not enough time. We will see. I am still excited for that match. Oh yes. Yeah. I'm super excited. I'm super, super excited, but like the, I, you know what, there's look at, I don't like to discount someone as great as Eddie hall because you know, of, of all the athletic performances I've seen in my life, whether it's in basketball or boxing or arm wrestling or any sport, what Eddie hall did.
SPEAKER_01: you know, when he did that deadlift. That's right up there for me. So, you know, I know how great of an athlete he is. I just really have a hard time seeing somebody beat Brian Shaw as a newcomer. He's just the strength. Engin, have you met Brian yet? I mean, no. He and Derek Smith, they called me. We had a video chat.
SPEAKER_02: And then, and then, and then, uh, we had some conversation on the Instagram. We're going to do a podcast together. And so, and it is a great, it's great that our messaging, our messaging is growing and with David, uh, like Robert Baxter getting involved. I just believe that like the future is super bright, you know, because Robert is like, I cannot even imagine like
SPEAKER_02: like anyone who is better than Robert, because this guy is the master's category world champion armwrestler, and he's a super high-level businessman. And his love for armwrestling is great. He says that he has so many things to do, but he will let other people to run those things. He will let other people who work for him, and he will be focusing on armwrestling. So it just shows that this guy,
SPEAKER_02: In my opinion, Laos, I must think for sure I can say that more than I do because I mean, I don't know if I was that busy with all the businesses. Well, hold on. Hold on. Yeah. I mean, you use the word more. I would just say perhaps equivalent. I say more. Yeah, you can say that way for me. Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_02: And I didn't say it's more than you, because I don't want to say that, but I like, like, I'm just thinking like who would be having all kinds of businesses and be busy. He's perfect. Yeah, he's perfect. And such a respectful, such a humble guy. And I think tomorrow he, you, John and I, we will have a podcast.
SPEAKER_02: then people i want people to uh to get to know him you know like because american people knows him already and they have nothing except same beautiful things about him but i want the global community to get to know this um a great great person yeah yeah no it's it's it we we are so blessed to have
SPEAKER_01: him in our community and potentially, I mean, him coming in, it's the absolute best thing. It's better than Dana White. It's better than... Yes, yes, yes. It's perfect. Because they don't know the sport. They may have different ideas that may hurt the sport. You understand? The same way that you being on top is better than anything that's happened, Robert coming in is going to multiply all of us.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. And you have already been our window to the rest of the world. And now we see the Brian show, Eddie Hall. And then I hear things like I don't want to mention some special guests. And then I think like it will be crazy. Next King of the Table in US will be off the roof. Levan got the visa. He's coming. And like only a bright future. The only thing that we need to do is just
SPEAKER_02: Stay unified. There was Super Chat, sorry. We still haven't talked about Gennady and Mike. Yeah, we will, but just like one second because later I'm losing this Super Chat. Another question to Devon. I wonder why he did trash talk during the whole match with Leonidas.
SPEAKER_02: sorry there was a loud car that went by that was something about leonidas yeah he's asking he's asking uh why you talk all the time trash to leonidas but i don't think there's something new you know well that's what i do that's that's what i do yeah maybe yeah they would be kind of weird if i didn't like uh
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but you said you were going to do it. Yeah, I said I was going to do it. He knew I was going to do it. I really didn't think. When I said this match, it was the time that I saw you against Sean Stowe. And then I saw him against John. And I really didn't think that it would be that far. But then suddenly, you gained so much power.
SPEAKER_01: i had a very good rebound a very like yes when i pulled chance i was probably that was probably one of the weakest states that have ever been in my in my in my adult life yeah that's what i was what i was thinking and that's why i was also the water fasting because i see that yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: constipated devon says bob legends here thank you very much and now i think one more super chat constipated devon be careful devon dehydration causes constipation yeah yeah yeah i'll uh i'll make sure to uh maybe do some enemas the day before or something yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: There's one guy saying why Levan is not going to East vs West 15 because he doesn't like to travel a lot before his match. He's just focused on training. And then last one is Katabolic T-Rex. Devon, what is uglier, the Battle of Stalingrad or Oleg Petrenko?
SPEAKER_02: Oleg Petrenko is going to be uglier. Okay. Peter, I'm sure. Hello, Engin. Can you ask Devon how to recover as fast as possible? And guys, just please give a break to the Superchester. Let's talk about the cart and how to recover as quick as possible. Quickly, maybe. I think that a lot of... Now, I'm going to assume that he's talking about after a weight cut, but I'll kind of answer like a little bit outside of that as well.
SPEAKER_01: Uh, I think that the, the most important thing, and, and I'm not an absolute expert, but you know, you have to get, uh, your minerals in your salts, uh, because that's, what's really going to hold the water. You have, obviously I'll be completely depleted of all my sugars. Uh, um, so sugars, waters, that's, that's the biggest thing I think. Uh, and I've always found for recovery, the most important thing is movement, movement.
SPEAKER_01: is how you increase the circulation without doing damage that's really what you're after you're after an increase of circulation so yeah yeah movement movement okay let's go quickly let's go and or do you want to do the match predictions together with petrenko later yeah whatever whatever look at i think when petrenko and i get on we'll probably just fight
SPEAKER_02: That's what I think. Oh, you will fight? Okay, okay, okay. Well, that's the thing. I mean, look, I don't think... Let's start. Yeah. Let's start. Like, Irina Galatkaya. You know Irina, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know everybody on the card. Okay, so she's pulling against Brigitte. Both are world champions. The only difference is that Brigitte is more active while Galatkaya is just coming back. But I saw her photos with the bicep and everything. She looks...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, she looks ready. Yeah, yeah. I think good match, good match. But I have to go with Irina Gladkaya just because I think her experience is, she just has, she's been the best for so long. I think she can make it happen. Okay. And the winner of this match most likely will pull Fia, right, for the world title. So then if you think that Irina Gladkaya is going to win, and then, yeah, it will be the next one, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, let's go. Let me, one second, one second. And just, okay. Oğuzhan Kocak versus Nugo. Nugo is your guy, I know.
SPEAKER_01: yeah and and look at nugo i love nugo i've got quite a soft spot for the guy um i i really enjoy watching nugo you know um i'm a i'm a really big fan of the georgian team in general um and you know nugo is special i i just think that there's something like i've arm wrestled nugo
SPEAKER_01: And you know that thing he does like with his head? Yeah. I feel that. I feel that right through his arm. It's all connected. He's a very interesting athlete. Nugo to me is a very, but I also know, you say Kocac, right? That's how you say it? Yeah, Ozan Kocac, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Also, Kocak has very big wins about many different, like Barbosa, like Tautiev, Jordan Sonev. Yeah, I think that he should be the favorite, really. I think he's bigger. I think that he's got to be. But he has been inactive. He has been inactive. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that he actually, I think on paper, he should be the favorite.
SPEAKER_02: But I just have to support Nugo just because I think he's so crazy. I know, I know, I know. You guys, I see that you guys get along very well, yeah. Frantic is also saying everyone has their own character or shit in the matches and our friend after the matches. Yeah, he says, thank you for support. And then... Yeah, I talked to... Sorry, what? Yeah, I talked to Leonidas today. Yeah. Oh, yeah? He's not upset with you?
SPEAKER_01: No, I mean, we're buddies. We're talking about bringing him over here and hanging out and training. I love Leonidas Arcona. He's fabulous. The other day I was talking with Hermes. Hermes also said that he would like to visit you and train with you. Yeah, I would love that. I like it. Did you know that he's coming here and he's going to stay until Tuesday and Monday he's going to come here and we will train together. Good, good. I'll jump in on that training.
SPEAKER_02: When are you going? You want me to extend your ticket? Well, you didn't buy a ticket, did you? Oh, I buy you. I already sent you the tickets. You did? Yeah. Did you lose? Are you sure? Yeah. One second. Let me forward. Hold on. After the, after the, after the, after the, uh, hold on, hold on, hold on. I hope you didn't buy it. Are you joking with me? Let me see. One second.
SPEAKER_02: One second. How is it that I didn't buy it? Listen, I hope you didn't. I hope you didn't buy my ticket. I did. You did? Are you sure? Yes. I even sent you. You even sent me the passport. I'm forwarding you right now. Just wait. You even sent me the passport of Jody and...
SPEAKER_02: copy you know in yours you know like look at i just forwarded to you and this was like long ago oh don't tell me that you asked about tickets okay okay okay hold on you know what after this after this let's figure this out because um
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, let's figure it out. Let's talk after the program, if you want. Okay, where are we? You said that Oguzhan should be the favorite, but you are saying that you like Nugo and his team. And then Azat versus Daniil Ustinov. Azat is the current 70kg world champion versus 75kg world champion.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So I don't follow as I know who has that is. I don't follow him as closely. This, this Daniel Ustinov, am I saying his name right? Yes. Daniel Ustinov from Kazakhstan. Yeah. He's unbelievable. I watch his training. He is so good and he is so strong at that weight. And he is 20 years old. He is.
SPEAKER_01: so strong i watch him train and i can't believe how strong he is i i think he's gonna win i i look at this kid and he is impressive he is so he looks to me so healthy and so strong and so focused i i i have him as the winner i have him as the winner i don't know i mean this
SPEAKER_02: This Daniel Ustinov, he is so strong. It's really, for his, I mean, any weight, even, and he's so light, but I mean, his lifts are ridiculous. Yeah, and who's winning? Daniel? Daniel. Oh, yeah. Okay, okay. But I will tell you something. I look at the cards about the WOC champions and guys who pull. I think whenever I look at these cards,
SPEAKER_02: Probably the only guy that didn't pull at Valve is Patashinx, I think. And many of them are world champions. Brigitte, Irina Gladkaya, Daniil, Azad, Oguzhan, Nuzgari. Nuzgari is the youth champion. Omer, Artur, Karolina, Dimitrina, Betkili, Oleg, Kanayi.
SPEAKER_02: and Rino and Samushya, Dzerano, Laletin, I mean, like Gennady and Matyshenko, almost all of them are WAP champions. Anyway, so let's go to Artur Makarov versus Omer Kozakoğlu. You know, Artur, the interesting thing is that yesterday Artur said something to me I couldn't believe in my eyes. I couldn't believe.
SPEAKER_02: He said he is about 20, 25% stronger than the time that he beat. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Like Arthur beating Mindaugas and now being 25% stronger. And he said, I said, is this your best shape? He said, no, it was my best shape was when I pulled you. He told me. Sorry Mindaugas, sorry about it. But anyways, the other guy, do you know the other guy? This is almost like Zoltan type, but this time right arm. And you know, Arthur has this kind of different genetic as well. So how do you see this match?
SPEAKER_01: yeah battle of the freaks battle of the freaks um i to me i see this this young turkish kid and um yeah i think he's special like look at obviously makarov is special too and they have a sit let's it's a bit similar really but when i see the degree that this guy is has his weight distributed in his skeleton and his musculature on his right and i watch him arm wrestle i watched him at what path
SPEAKER_01: he's, I think he's going to win. And I think, and I think he's going to hold it for a long time. I think that you're going to see another, uh, another, uh, yeah, but in the right. And I think that he's going to move up the categories. Like he's going to be super dominant. Like that's what I think. I think that this guy, he's young, he's, he's,
SPEAKER_01: He's going to be a champion and he's going to be that for a long time. That's what I think. Yeah. I believe so too. Yeah. He's very tall. Yeah. He's got everything. He's got the only thing is that he's young. That's it. That's the only thing. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so Omer already gained a title shot, somebody is asking here, by winning one. He was on fouls, yes, but so since Aydarhan is put in 85 kilo category, so as an 80 kilo top two guys, it's normal that Omer has his title shot and I don't think that anyone would like to pull him right now, including Mindaugas. Maybe Artur, yes, we will see. And let's go to the next one.
SPEAKER_01: um yeah dimitrina versus carolina peterson yeah good match i'm going with carolina carolina okay did you know yeah and dimitrina won yeah yeah yeah yeah i i i follow look i i don't follow dimitrina as closely as i do carolina yeah but uh carolina like i watch her i watch her results
SPEAKER_02: I know a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. She lately. Yeah. Yeah. There was last year as well. This year they pull in different category and they both won the wealth, but Carolina, this Europeans and the wealth, I see that she is just nothing but progressing and yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We will see. And did you know that one of the pull you one of five left arm? Yeah. Wow.
SPEAKER_01: Wow. Yeah. See another Georgian, another superstar against, you know, a legend of the sport. This is a great match world title. Um, I am obviously, you know, Oleg Zok has, he's a legend. Oleg Zok is a legend. Um, his hand is incredible. I, I have to believe that Oleg Zok is still not as good as he was pre accident. I don't believe.
SPEAKER_01: I agree. And I will also say that that Killian Ianni is probably the one of the most well-rounded, fundamentally strong arm wrestlers in the, in the sport. You know, his match with paying off was so impressive. Yes. One of the most impressive world title victories that I've seen. Um, he was so dumb and so strong structurally in all aspects.
SPEAKER_01: I have to have him as the favorite. The progress that he's made since the last time they pulled is significant. Last time they pulled, I had Oleg as the winner. And now I have- And he was very upset with you. Basically was very upset with you. I know, I know, I know. Hey, listen, I picked the guy I think is gonna win. It doesn't mean I don't love you. It doesn't mean that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We know, we know, we know. But he's not the same guy. I'm a huge fan.
SPEAKER_02: I'm a huge fan of both of these athletes. Betkely Oneani. I'm a fan of every athlete on this card. These guys are superstars. If you're an arm wrestling fan and you are not really amazed by these people, then yeah. And this Betkely guy is just incredible. He was a skinny, tall guy, but he's not a skinny, tall guy. He's a tall guy, but not a skinny guy. He looks so healthy.
SPEAKER_01: When I look at that, I see him just such a healthy guy in his structure, in his physique, healthy, healthy guy and so strong. It's he's going to be difficult to beat. I think he's going to win. And I think that
SPEAKER_01: Obviously, it's a great match. I don't expect it to be easy. But I think the only chance is for Oleg to really take his hand. And I think that even if he does, even without his hand, I don't think you're getting through Batkili's arm. And I don't even think... Will you be surprised if Batkili even top rolls him?
SPEAKER_01: I will not be surprised if by the end he does, if he does it first round. Yeah, I'll be surprised, but I won't be surprised if by round four, that Beck Kelly looks quite dominant. I won't be surprised, but yeah, so I've got Beck Kelly as a favorite, but I don't know, like Zola, look at the very best version of Zoc, the very best version of Zoc. I would still, I would have Zoc as a favorite.
SPEAKER_01: But I don't think this is the, I think he's maybe 75 or 80% by my estimation. I don't know. And that might not be enough. It might not be enough. Okay, let's go. Todd Hutchings versus Yoshinobu Kanai.
SPEAKER_02: Did you know that Yoshinobu Kanai wanted to pull against you originally? Listen, what happened is that I reached out. I'm the type of guy that my mission is to just make sure that it is as entertaining as possible. For many years, a lot of people went around, you know, I'm world champion, world champion.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but I just wanted to make sure that it has the heaviest meaning in the history right now. And this already is the, when you say you are world champion East versus West, that is really like as good as it can get almost, you know, like it is just, it's getting harder and harder. So that is why I reach out to the old champions because they left the sport. Maybe they didn't think there was a future. And then now I remember Kanai.
SPEAKER_02: And I reached out through some other people. He said he has a lower back problem. Maybe three times, he very kindly rejected. And then suddenly,
SPEAKER_02: He came, somebody wrote to me from Japan. He said, Kanai wants to compete. I was very happy. And he said, he wants to compete against Devon. And I said, listen, Devon has a super match with Petrenko. Also, I think it is a very tough start for Kanai. And he said that he will wait. And I said, how about someone else? He said, no, he will wait for the next year. And I said, how about Tata Shinks? And then when I said Tata Shinks, he said, let's go. And yeah. I will love to pull Kanai.
SPEAKER_02: That's a guy that I missed before he kind of left. And if he's back, I love to pull him. So eventually, eventually that, that, that match, I would love for it to happen maybe in Japan, who knows, but, but yeah, I would love. Great. But he needs to win this match. If he wins against Todd, the match would make sense without winning against Todd. And you know, I see that like you need to really dominate with the hand domination, control everything to beat.
SPEAKER_02: But whenever you miss his pronator, for example, it is hard to beat him. And Tad is not like that really hand-controlled guy. He's just back pressure and he's sideways. So I think it will give a room for Kanayi to do what Prudnik and what Ongarbeev did. They put a break to Tad at some point. And if Kanayi has that break, that match may be really long, is my estimation.
SPEAKER_01: This is actually one of the matches that I have a very, very difficult time calling. And I know that everywhere you look and everyone you talk to, even on the betting sites, Todd Hutchings is a massive favorite. But I don't see it that way. There is a possibility to go that way, but if the match somehow stops, it may become a nightmare. Yesterday, I talked to Neil. Neil said that
SPEAKER_01: If Kana is coming in his best shape, he said that he would take him as a favorite. And I was surprised about that one. That's the thing. The match is very interesting. Todd Hutchings is hot. He is hot and he is killing it. And we are all well aware of his excellence. But I remember...
SPEAKER_01: yoshi kanai when he was also really really good and i i see that it's 105 kilo class um which will make it harder for yoshi i think i mean this is what he chooses this is what he chooses well listen i remember when he pulled 80 kilograms at the worlds in japan so yeah you know yeah so long as he's strong and healthy
SPEAKER_02: It has great potential. This match has great potential to be a war. And if he contacted you and he said he was in great shape, I would believe that he's ready. Yeah, I believe so too. People don't understand. There are some athletes, they don't know what they are doing. When Jerry said that he wanted to pull a world title match, first match at the East versus West, people said, Jerry, you have been away since 2019. Like, come on. And he came and beat Kennedy.
SPEAKER_02: And then Ongarbe just came and beat John and took the title and he defended. He beat Irakli and he beat Michael Torby for that. And so some people, if they know arm wrestling, they know how to bring best shape. It doesn't matter how long they are inactive. That is what I believe. I believe that too. I don't want to call this match one. This one for me is really, really difficult. I don't have a clear favorite because...
SPEAKER_01: really this could be a very good match really really good so i don't this one for me is actually the first one i'll say for me is really a 50 50 match really that's interesting i i would still give as no disrespect because his unknown shape if it is he should be but you know what there's there's one reason there's one reason why it shifts it for me
SPEAKER_01: And the reason why is I actually believe that Yoshi can, I actually has a, I remember when he had a really good Kings move, he's had a Kings move for a long time. And, and I think that this is one of the best ways to beat Todd Hutchings because
SPEAKER_01: one of look at todd is so great at so many things but you don't see todd hutchings actually press yeah yeah yeah that's what i was thinking yeah and then you really need to apply that that brutal power press and yeah once yoshi has his pronator even he loses his hand he can hold forever you know yeah and that's that's what makes it when you factor in everything
SPEAKER_02: for me there's a possibility that this match gets really sloppy really because both of them is it could could be very interesting match i say it's 50 50. yeah the history will be written there for sure that night many matches choke on wax says they should michael and jerry switch matches michael should pull levan now um no no no and and then and then
SPEAKER_02: Dino Flintstone says, Devon, I will try to come to Istanbul to meet you. That's great, Dino. That's great. He's a longtime supporter of my channel. And yeah, it'd be great to meet you. Yeah. Okay. Let's go here. Reina versus Sago. Those, like my opinion, regardless of the result of the Petrenko match, this may be your next match, the winner of this one. But we will see.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, for sure. This is the match that I particularly am paying a lot of attention to. I've been watching, uh, you know, Reno and I've been watching a Bragum for, for some time, uh, at Bragum Sagoff, uh, from a physical perspective in the 150, he is so physically impressive. Um, he looked, he reminds me of Colossus. Do you know Colossus? Uh, the X man.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he reminds me of Colossus. You know, the way that he grabbed round one, he grabbed Chance Shaw like by the wrist. Yeah, yeah. His fingers are very strong. Hey, listen, this time, no matter what, we need to do some after pulls. Come on, man. Seriously, like we have all these legends. After the match, everyone is disappearing, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Like we need to, but not, not there maybe, but we need to do somewhere anyway. So how do you see this? I know you support Reno because you like young hope. No, no, no. I like them both. I actually really liked that at Bragg as well. I think it's super cool. Look, I look at, to me from a physical perspective,
SPEAKER_01: They're both incredible. I watched the way they both train. They're both so strong. Um, you know, Reno is 20 years old. He's 20. That's crazy for him to be so accomplished at 20. Is this, this is wild. Um, Auden and I talk about this match a lot. Uh, I do see, I do see Reno as being a little bit more technical.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but will it help? Because I don't see anywhere this match is going except inside. Even Chance couldn't go outside with Ibrahim. I'm not saying Chance is better than Reyna, but Chance is very hard to be hooked and get in. But even if they both go in?
SPEAKER_01: There's still, there might be more movement from Reno, more angles to exploit, even within the hook, if they both go to, or even within the press, you know, open press, if they're even both in there, look at, I think that Braga might be a bit stronger. Um,
SPEAKER_01: again, this is a very close match. I don't think that this is one sided at all, but I, I tend to believe that Reno's experience, even at 20 and his arm wrestling IQ will be a little bit higher. And, you know, over the course of the four rounds, I think we might be looking at a 20 year old East versus West champion. So you are saying that he has the edge?
SPEAKER_01: I think he might. I think he might have a slight edge. I think it's close. You know, physically, I think he's going to be, you know, not as strong. But I think that if the match starts to slow down or there starts to be opportunity for technical or like endurance or versatility, I think that I think that Reno like if I think if it's round one in the match stops, I think Reno is going to win.
SPEAKER_02: I think that we will see war, like really big war. And I think that referee really needs to be very careful for both athletes about the start and then about the center. And then after the match, if the shoulders are passing the center, we really need to... I'm going to talk with both athletes. I will just say, guys...
SPEAKER_01: Do not get upset, you know. Just keep your shoulder at your side of the table. You understand? And because, like, I mean, this is a very risky match. I hope they are not going to hit their heads to each other. Yeah, the good thing is it's four, you know. And even if there's a mistake in one or two rounds, I think at the end it will be decisive. So hopefully, you know, even if there is small gray areas, because there always is a little bit,
SPEAKER_02: I think that the better person is going to win that day. I personally give a slight edge to Reno. Okay. Thank you for your support, my friend. And we have David Samusha, Vladimir Mairov. Samusha. I remember you said the same thing last time we talked. Yeah. Do you see...
SPEAKER_02: Anyone beating him? Maybe Aydar Khan in a rematch? That was very close. I kind of felt like if Aydar Khan had the shoulder press, he could have won that one. Or someone either cutting down or coming up.
SPEAKER_02: I don't see anyone. Maybe this guy, Omer, Turkish guy, if he can make like 85 kilos, really. Yeah. Right. Something like that. Something like that. But no, I mean, at this point, the question Samusha, I mean, he's pretty awesome. Pretty awesome. Yeah. Okay. Let's go. Now, this is your old category.
SPEAKER_01: Vitaly Laletin or Georgi Dzernov? Vitaly Laletin. Interesting match. Very interesting match. There's a lot of excitement and hype around Georgi Dzernov. Like, there's a lot of excitement. Particularly, you know, he's always been extremely strong. He's champion. But I think a lot of people were really shocked at his match with Rivas. I was.
SPEAKER_01: Like the way that he beat Rivas. I was surprised. I learned something new that day. I never thought that first round he could just control him right at the center without the strap. I thought it was impossible. I thought he would get flashed first two rounds, you know, at least. Me too. Us too. We all thought that here. I didn't think it was impossible, but I thought best case maybe, you know, a three to two victory maybe where like, you know, how he normally does it.
SPEAKER_01: but um yeah i i he's he's very shocking he's you know but i have to think that vitaly has got to still be the favorite he's got the thing that's the thing that makes it very curious for me is vitaly and revas pulled and and in round one the way i remember it
SPEAKER_02: before like i think rivas broke his finger or something hurt his hand like in round two or three yeah he broke his finger yeah but round one was very close if i remember yeah yeah yeah he had the advantage he just couldn't finish and he got exhausted yeah very close there was a little bit like like ravers was kind of too high and uh we thought it was a little bit too low on the start i don't know uh if it was
SPEAKER_01: remember that yeah yeah okay i you know what i wasn't aware of that but to me that doesn't really matter to me this is this is what happened in the match was close round one was close and where it wasn't with the zernoff and rivas yeah so this even again it gives me questions um because you know if the zernoff beats vitaly
SPEAKER_01: uh-huh wow you know that puts him right right up at the top that puts him in with the match with ermys or michael or whoever wins gnadi you know this this puts it basically if if if disano beats vitality he can't even get a match with levan you know i don't that's right you know yeah yeah yeah i mean just
SPEAKER_02: and i think there is such possibility i don't think that i don't think i can say that vitality is going to win for sure i i see like i can imagine there is a way that it can possibly happen now am i right when i remember that they had is it
SPEAKER_02: them that had the 10 no it's not them that had the 10-minute match at the world's all those years ago is it no it is it was it was uh alexander getalo versus right vitality right right right just couldn't couldn't pin him like 10 minutes and right yeah but but this guy beats you know like this guy is so strong that at 110 kilo he beat ivan matushenko
SPEAKER_02: and yeah and right now he doesn't look normal you know like i remember his shape when he pulled against ferit osmanlı at the press conference his shoulders like everything he was incredible looking and i think that right now he will be in his best shape of his life and like i will tell you something this card whenever i look at i don't care if i'm organizing or not nobody no matter what who is organizing this card i mean he just cut in my braids you know so even imagining them on the stage
SPEAKER_02: and we will see you know you know i i tell everybody i tell everybody that same thing this is the very best night arm wrestling we will have ever seen yes yes uh one loop one lupus thank you to for so much you do for arm wrestling engine please please bring back ayane takanaka versus carolina peterson maybe ayana needs another shot at petro my friend normally
SPEAKER_01: My phone, my phone is at 2%. Okay, just let's turn the video off and then we do the next message later. Or you want to finish it totally? Yeah. My phone's gonna die. Okay. Okay. I can go straight home. I can plug my phone in but
SPEAKER_02: No, no, we have two matches that we can do in another podcast. I'm at 2%. Listen, if I fade out, thank you so much. I'll see you tomorrow. And then with Petrenko. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Listen, guys, this match was going to be Ayana versus Dimitrina. If Ayana would win the Waffles, and I told her to just go win Waffles, and we will do a rematch.
SPEAKER_02: But Ayana, unfortunately, took third place at the 55-kilo woman category. And so I had to set Carolina. And Plus Comp, do you guys believe Dennis will ever come back anywhere near the best? Dennis! Dennis! Give me Dennis at the event. Give me Dennis. I'll pull him at 105 at the end of the event. I will pull him that day, left-handed. I'll never be that weak ever in my life again. And if so...
SPEAKER_02: If so, would have to have a chance against Levan. Best of luck, Devon versus Petrenko. I don't think he will ever be. Are you there, Devon? Devon left, yeah. OK. OK, guys, so let's talk. OK, I think the Super Chess. Fight me, Prudnik.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, Engin. Hello again, Engin. I hope everybody is ready. The grandmaster move is coming soon to theater near you on pay-per-view. Thank you very much for your support. MG Regal.

SPEAKER_02: Barefoot stretch out 65, 195 something, less, more. All the best, Devon and Engin. Thank you, my friend.
