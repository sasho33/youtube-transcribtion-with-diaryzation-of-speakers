SPEAKER_00: Hello. Hello. Hello, Todd. Howdy. How are you? Good. I'm doing well. How are you? Good. Good. Good. How's that new hire Robert Baxter working out? It's going well. Soon to be finalized. All right. I heard that you were there some time ago, not a week ago or something. Yeah. Yeah. Like not last week, but the week before.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, okay, okay. So how is the preparation? Doing very well. You know, every other week I'm setting a PR, but I'm doing a lot more work capacity, endurance type stuff. So hopefully the recovery comes on. Every other day a PR, new PR? Every other week. Every other week, yeah, sorry. That's about 50%. Sometimes I go two or three weeks without setting one, but then I'll set one three weeks in a row. But it's about 50%. Sometimes you break the record by 50%?
SPEAKER_04: No, no, no, no. 50% of the time I break a record, but it's not always every other one. If I look back at, and I'll set six records in 12 weeks, that's what I mean. I don't know how is this possible. If you were like 18 years old, and then I understand you're doing that, but you are a little older. What is that, 23? What are you? I've been 23 twice.
SPEAKER_00: and then and then another well 11 and a half yeah yeah i i that's great why do you think that that's happening because you discover more about arm wrestling and then that that is how you can
SPEAKER_04: still improve by being healthier or just do you like you you you find the ways to get stronger yeah well i'm getting stronger in the same way i always have i got a pretty good program that i didn't invent but mainly i stay pretty healthy i mean i haven't i've had very very few injuries
SPEAKER_04: so you know injuries will usually knock people out for six months but that six months sometimes turns into a year and that's really hard to bounce back i've only had really two injuries and i was fully recovered from both of them within six months you know one of the reason that you don't get injured often because you already feel the pressure
SPEAKER_04: during the training, maybe even more than the pressure that you feel at the competition. That could be it. I mean, if you train, if you're lifting as much as you possibly can lift,
SPEAKER_00: you probably never do that in a match because you can only lift as much as the other guy can push on you, you know? So that could be, I mean, Louie Simmons says weak things break. So if you're strong, things don't break. Yeah. But still, you know, it depends, you know, because everyone has a limit. You may be strong, but sometimes the strong things break even more terribly, you know, because of just like,
SPEAKER_00: pushing something that is more than it can handle and breaks. They say that if you are not flexible, you get breaks. Yeah, I mean, that makes sense. I'm not very flexible. I mean, I'm not very flexible. I know.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, arm wrestlers have pretty common injuries, right? Bicep tendons, shoulders, labrums, wrist issues. So you don't have to, you know, train. Everything doesn't have to be strong. Your wrists, shoulders, and elbows have to be strong.
SPEAKER_00: Especially, especially elbow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It needs to handle, you know, it needs to handle. I mean, sometimes you may lose your wrist, can still win. And, but if you, if your elbow, I don't know, I usually suffer from the elbow, but like some of the elbow injuries, you are older than me, but I think I have been involved in arm wrestling near 10 years earlier than you. And yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And like at the beginning, you experience inner elbow issues.
SPEAKER_00: but the outside of the elbow usually comes with the muscular imbalance you know because of years of this and nothing nothing goes back is tendon here you know while you put pressure here and this side becomes weak and usually i i like this this was earlier this was later and the latest is probably the shoulder i don't know if you ever experienced but john experience is the latest i think the shoulder issue
SPEAKER_00: i haven't but i train all those reverse moves so i keep everything balanced yeah yeah i specifically train them that's why you don't get injured yeah yeah and and also your movement is the one of the hardest one on the elbow side pressure but do you also do you think that like you can handle all that pressure only because of
SPEAKER_04: the way that you are training or you think that you are also genetically uh strong first i think i'm conditioned to it so yeah you know so so i'm used to it so i'm pro it's probably a base level of strength and
SPEAKER_04: It's hard on my elbow, but it's hard on their elbow, too, and they're not used to it. So in that case, I have an advantage because I go, yeah, I've been here. I'm here every week. You're here once every five years when we arm wrestle each other, you know, roost them. Yeah, you're right. The reason I injured because I was pulling so many heavier guys, heavier guys. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: um and i was pushing the limits uh so much but yeah your your side pressure is painful so uh handle i i tried to get uh kanai as well i don't have direct communication with kanai but through a friend of him and i asked him but you know i am seven hours ahead of you and he's probably six hours ahead of me so there's 13 hours also
SPEAKER_00: It is hard to find Japanese translator. And I asked him, it is easier to find English speaking guy in Japan than finding Japanese guy in my country. You understand? But I asked him if they have English and it took a long time. So the turn on time came and so I had to do the podcast with you. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I hope I'm still looking, but I think I will find someone who can translate at least at the podcast, not podcast, the press conference. So where do you see, since you say that you are breaking PR records, does it mean that we will see the best of you?
SPEAKER_04: I would hope so. I mean, I hope everybody's improving. I mean, I hope nobody's showing up going, Oh, I'm so much weaker than I was three months ago. You know, the, you know, it's, go ahead. As long as what you're training is how you arm wrestle a lot of arm wrestle, a lot of arm wrestlers train in a style they don't compete in. So I'm not sure that helps them. Yeah. Yeah. It is very, very hard for many people to remain.
SPEAKER_00: be in the same shape all the time when you somehow somehow you're doing uh you remember the the the uh my idea about you are doing very good two matches in the usually in the third match you are having struggling but since you are breaking the prs right now it it must not be the case or well do you even agree in the earlier events that
SPEAKER_04: No, I still agree with what you said. I do real bad if the match is in January or February, because for me, November, December, and January are very hard to train because I travel a lot with family, with work. The end of the year is really tough for me on work. In America, we stack all these holidays on top of each other. So I'm traveling, you know, my family lives a long ways away from each other. So, um,
SPEAKER_04: January and February are really, I usually do bad in those events because I've only had, you know, I've had half as much good training as I've normally did. Usually about March, March to November, I can probably maintain the same high level. But between November, you know, so let's say
SPEAKER_04: So December to February, yeah, I'm not very competitive. You have two losses at the East Northwest. One was in summer, I think, against Prudnik, but the other one was in the winter against Tarikian, correct? Yeah. Yeah. And losing to Prudnik, I would have lost that match no matter when you had it. He was just way better than me. Okay. When the whole unedited match takes three minutes, I got beat pretty bad.
SPEAKER_00: But that was the only way to beat you anyways. Yeah. Yeah, the match had to finish quick. The question, was Prudnik in the last match you had against him in the same shape as the first one? And if yes, so it means that you were much stronger in the second time. He wasn't.
SPEAKER_04: He wasn't anywhere near when I pulled him the last time. The last time I pulled him, remember, I think he was 240 or 250 pounds. It was quite a bit bigger. No, no. You both weigh 107 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, well, are you sure? Because I think he weighed more than that. Anyways, in Florida... No, no, no, sorry. When I said both 107, the limit was 107. I'm not saying you were 107. He was 107, but you were probably 220 or something. Yeah, and I'm the same size, but yeah, the Prudnik in Florida would have lost to the Prudnik that beat me. But how about the Prudnik that beat you against you that beat Prudnik?
SPEAKER_04: would be a good one that would be close i think um that would be yeah because these guys these guys like prudnik these these high level world-class guys you sometimes have to pull them three or four times before you figure out what works you know so um if i were to pull the strong prudnik now
SPEAKER_00: I'm not saying it would go the same way, but I would feel a lot more, a lot more confident now. You know? Yeah. Okay, let's talk about Kanai. The Sunday, I think it was Sunday night over here, I talked with Neil, and Neil thinks that if Kanai somehow could bring his prime shape, he said that
SPEAKER_00: would see Neil would see him as the favorites and that was because a lot of people don't know about Kanai while Neil organized events you know at Armours for Kanai so he's very knowledgeable and but he was surprising him to say that he didn't say like like a big favorite but you know like a barely favorite
SPEAKER_04: What do you think about this? Do you think that Besto Kanai would be a dangerous opponent for you? Yeah, I think the Besto Kanai, the Kanai that was beating Bresnan and Ron Bass and a small Michael Todd and a younger, better John, that Kanai would be a favorite against me.
SPEAKER_04: Especially if I pulled Kanae like all those other foes. I've seen Kanae, I've watched so many of his videos that if you let him get, if he gets his wrist high to where he'd get his shoulder in, he doesn't hardly ever lose. So I don't plan to let him get his shoulder in. I mean, I might not even test his side pressure. Unless I'm up 2-0, I'm not even going to test his side pressure.
SPEAKER_04: What do you mean? You are also slight pressing, but what do you mean you are not going to test his slight pressure? You're going to finish him quick, you mean? I don't know if it's quick or I don't know whether it's... I'm going to try to finish everybody quick, but I want him... I want his arm coming across the pads with his hand more in the center of the table with me doing more back pressure rather than like...
SPEAKER_04: Michael Todd, Tim Bresnan, and Ron Bath kept hitting him sideways, trying to pin him really, really fast. And once Kenai got the match on his side of the pegs, he was able to get that shoulder in and activate all that side pressure. But if you keep his arms stretched out, it's really hard for him to get in there and activate that. So I'm going to be primarily a back pressure top roll type guy.
SPEAKER_00: hmm but but i see that like whenever even people pose that way as long as he has his pronated even like in an open arm he's like still defending and like some people think it requires a shoulder pressure to finish him and i won't shoulder impression but
SPEAKER_04: not only is he good if he's got his pronator he's good if he's completely under and you pull his wrist down the smart thing to do is you can get him rolled over if you can get him hooked in like this that drops his wrist down if his wrist is down he can't get that shoulder underneath there if he flops his hand and allows his wrist to come in he can now dig that arm out so yeah i don't
SPEAKER_00: I don't want him getting that shoulder in at all. I want him uncomfortable the whole time. At least for match one, because I've never met him. I never shook his hand, never talked to him. But do you think that like, you say that even here like this, like even the arm is like this, Todd. The pronator is not something that only works here. Almost it is like totally turned. Even here you have, that is still pronator holding that too.
SPEAKER_00: not to turn more, you know. So what I'm just saying, some people top rollers, we have the pronator here. But some people, they may have their pronator like even in this position. Like it looks like it is like turned, but it still reacts from here to stop you. If it turns here totally, you lose. So what I'm just saying, if you don't put the pressure, I saw him jump, I saw John beating him in 2005 Japan, but he had the like full...
SPEAKER_00: wrist, everything. He took everything. He didn't miss here. So every time John missed, Kanae is here. Even John won. John was struggling and sometimes finishing him with the shoulder pressure. Yeah, I think it will be interesting. I think that stretching him may also cause you to
SPEAKER_00: missing his pronator as well because your wrist is not my opinion not like that full control like this you're using your wrist usually when you hook with a little bit you know forwards hooking you know yeah we will see we will see but i think it's gonna be it's gonna be a great match uh just one second let me put here the what is one second charger yeah
SPEAKER_00: I mean, if he can stop you, we don't know where he is. Do you think it is possible someone to be away from arm wrestling for many years and come back at his best? Some people believe it's not possible, but I believe that if the person is experienced, knowledgeable enough, he can make a strong comeback. Jerry was away from arm wrestling since the WL. He just came in with Gennady. Ongarbe was away for many years. He just came with John.
SPEAKER_00: Michael Jordan directly in a row, you know. So do you think that Kanai may bring his best shape or something here? I'm expecting it. I think it's possible. I think if I was away for six years,
SPEAKER_04: and took a year to come back, I think I would be there. The one thing that shocks most of these people when they come back, like people who've taken a lot of time off, is arm wrestling itself has come up some. So everybody now is better than they were six years ago. Also, East vs. West is a unique event. I mean, it's a very big, very popular, there's a lot of pressure.
SPEAKER_04: a lot more pressure on him because a he's coming back after six years b he's coming to east first west for the first time so he's got to deal with all of that and i'm quite comfortable with all that stuff you know i know where the food is i know how the hotel works i know how to get everything so to me this is just another day at the office you know um the fact that
SPEAKER_04: he's pulling me right off the bat out of six years i mean first i go i don't know if i'm honored or insulted i don't know i don't know so i'm keeping it a little no no no listen can i use a legendary look like a lot of people like if arsene lillier would make a comeback
SPEAKER_00: and just say that, Engin, I want to pull a title match. Maybe not the title match, but somewhere near I would give him that because that is a... I also feel it's the same for Kanai. It is not like... And just remember, Kanai...
SPEAKER_00: I reached him out three times in the last two years, and not directly, but through someone. And he said that he has a lower back injury and he's done with arm wrestling. But I never stopped because I asked again, things may change. And then finally, he just sent me someone. He wrote me. He said, he wants to pull. And he said he wants to pull against Devon.
SPEAKER_00: And I said, like, Devon may be high start, not that because he's stronger than you or less or something, but he's just like second in the super heavyweight category, ranked second after Devon. And I said, he also has a match with Petrenko. And now after I tell you this, you will understand it's an honor. I said, like, do you want to pull someone else? He said, no, I want to pull Devon.
SPEAKER_00: But you need to wait for the next year because he has Petrenko match. He said, okay, I'm going to wait.
SPEAKER_00: So he wanted to pull best, and I offered him a few names he didn't accept. But whenever I said Tata Sings, he said, let's go. Oh, okay. I knew he'd ask for Devin first. I didn't know he went through the rest of the list. It's an honor for me, you know, because I like him. It's an honor for him, too, to pull against you. I mean, you guys are great guys. So I just think that Armisen came to a point that it has never been before. And I just, like, it is not easy to...
SPEAKER_00: raise attack hashings or kanai when i say race like like someone to come to that level is not that easy that is why i have known some people like at that level but quit our messaging and i'm i'm just calling them to make sure that hey this is our time now come back you know just join the part hardly yeah yeah and i i think it will be even better thought with the robert baxter's involvement is
SPEAKER_00: Like I am good about armwrestling related things, but about the business, I'm not a businessman. And if you want to bring it to the next level, I was expecting some other type of organizations owners to reach out to us. But I think that Robert is the best person possible because he's a businessman, he loves armwrestling, he himself armwrestler.
SPEAKER_00: and he's such a wonderful person i i don't know what is your experience with him but it's i i think that you think the same way because you reached me out and you said that like right person or something you told me i think yeah if i'm not mistaken yeah good uh the only choice and the right person was that he's great only person yeah he's he's the only person you could have picked for this he's perfect perfect yeah yeah and he he would never do any wrong to anyone
SPEAKER_04: No. Yeah. And as you know that I never did wrong to any of you guys. And I'm sure you would witness that. I tell everybody I can. I've never been in a better league or had a better boss than I do right now. No boss.
SPEAKER_00: there's no boss but yeah but i'm telling you rob robert will be the same exact as as caring about the athletes and he will do much better job about the business and uh we will see we will see so how do you see your chances against can i you like your chances yeah yeah i i like my chances um it's odd you know because you only see so much from the video um
SPEAKER_04: I think we'll, I think we'll slip. I don't, I mean, I think we'll get a, I think we'll slip pretty easily. I like the straps. I like the fact that I probably have more reach than he does. His absolute brute power. I'm fully respecting, but you know, I've pulled super, super strong people before. So yeah. And I just think there's just a lot of things in my favor. Now, a year from now,
SPEAKER_04: think my chances are i mean if he stays in east first west for a year my chances a year from now are less than they are in two weeks so i think this is my best chance against him because when he's fresh off the couch coming in yeah but it doesn't mean that you cannot beat him one year later still you you both will have your own chances yeah yeah but you are saying that right now you have the edge because of he's just joining us i think so i think uh
SPEAKER_00: I think, yeah, arm wrestling, I mean, there's been enough guys that have been gone and have come back and you've probably talked to them. Arm wrestling is better than what it was five years ago. Yeah. Do you agree that every time you guys come, like you all train all the time, you just three months train and just pull one super match. But do you, like, do you think that every time
SPEAKER_00: you and your opponents and all the other guys that are pulling they they get rested and they had a war there that is something adding to you guys that that experience at the table like like i kind of feel like for example samusha every time he has those wars next time i think he's coming stronger because of
SPEAKER_00: feeling that pressure all the time. You know, I kind of feel that your war against Ongarbe, yes, I mean, you won 3-0, but you had the control. You were not in the risk of losing, but still the finishing wasn't that easy. And the same, you had some tough matches with Stago. You had a match with Dadikyan. And I kind of believe that this competition level,
SPEAKER_00: is making you guys stronger do you think that this is the reason or to be part of a league that constantly like arranges matches well it's two the one the fact that there's no down season forces you to stay
SPEAKER_04: What it does is it forces you to be able to adjust your training so that you can be at your best every three or four months. So we get a lot smarter in our training. The actual struggle, the tough matches do benefit us physically to do that super hard workout. But more often than not,
SPEAKER_04: the mental benefits way there, you know, because you're in a high pressure situation against a world-class opponent and, um, you're forced to think adapt, try something, try to dig it out. Um,
SPEAKER_04: so yeah i mean i you know i've got way more experience with the referees than he's gonna have how that's gonna go down how the matches are gonna start the the uh getting miked up putting the camera on you know all that stuff so but yeah just being well to be honest being 12 weeks away from a competition year round forces you to constantly constantly be in competition mode
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah and also the different opponents and they all have different
SPEAKER_00: abilities and you you you are getting more experience like your preparation to do that again your preparation to ongarbev and other guys all different different type of preparation so you are becoming more skilled this is uh what i believe i mean you have many great guys but like constantly the opponents that you are pulling like really like very high level like you will be after this match
SPEAKER_00: we don't know who will be your opponent we will decide but maybe elective or the 95 kilo world title match or kautia if he beats him and there is still russian there is an unfinished business yeah another vengeance another vengeance he's first west listen would you want that match
SPEAKER_03: yeah for absolutely although it kind of scares me because i think i've lost school like five times so i do want it but it's like twice right twice i think one time 2005 2005 in the super match not not no more i think two matches zloty and then the time in russia was that is that the only two times oh you also beat him russia i thought that he beat you in a super match in zloty too
SPEAKER_04: My very first Zloty. 2005. And then we pulled a super match in Russia and he beat me. I think it was a PAL event in Russia and he beat me worse. I can't think of. Yeah, I'd have to go back and look. But no, I would like to pull all the 95 guys for sure.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah. All the 95 and hopefully also be back to 105. Yeah, and all the 105 guys. You are one of those guys right at the middle, 100-kilo range you are. And I think you can make both weight categories. I'll pull the 95 guys at King of the Table and I'll pull the 105 guys at East First West. Why is that?
SPEAKER_00: it just makes it cleaner that way. Nah, you gotta, you gotta pull wherever, wherever, wherever like you are needed. Yeah. We will offer you. And I, I think, I think you and Devon should pull as well. I, I, I kind of think that that will be a very, very good match. Very, very, I think you have compared to WL time. I think you have better, stronger pronator and you,
SPEAKER_00: Um, do you think that he's who matters was this way? Like, do you think that the way he pulled at the WL would be considered that the East was the first to fail? Like, do you think that his who matters was part of that or a little bit down? It might be, I don't, I'm not, I don't fear that King's move myself. So I would, you know, I don't, if he wants to make a difference, like, because like if he's part of that, if any, any, any, like,
SPEAKER_04: Two centimeters more you go down, two centimeters your hand gets higher. So it is coming to the pin pad. But how do you see? Do you think that your hands would be better than last time? I think I am definitely better than I was in the WAL. I am better at this 210-215 weight I am now than the 230 I was at the WAL. Devin's also better. I just...
SPEAKER_04: Half the world had our hopes on Devin beating LaVon. And when he left that weight class, he kind of let the world down. I mean, I'm surprised you let him leave that weight class because half the world is saying, Devin, haven't you seen the Rocky movies? You got to stay up there and beat that guy. But why is that? Why is that? You guys don't want to pull against him? I want to pull against him, but the world wants him to be super heavyweight champion. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I understand but I mean he tried he didn't work and then uh hopefully he will try again you know whenever he's ready but like he was usually like 120 kilos like he's around like 265 pulling against super heavy weight while like 12 pounds lower is another cut I think he he can he can make like when he will live on he could make the same shape almost same shape he could make
SPEAKER_00: 115, 253. And then he would still weigh about 265 the next day in the evening, you know? So, I mean, but the guy just, I think that he is light for super heavy, but still he did very well against Levan in the round one, you know? He did very good. I thought if he would have pulled Levan like, I think he could Hermes Levan better than Hermes pulled Levan.
SPEAKER_04: So I think Devin's chances against LeVon are way better than what it looks like because Ermey's looked really good against LeVon. Devin could do what Ermey's did way better. Longer arm, far bigger hand, you know, good endurance. I think if Devin pulls LeVon again and pulls him more in an Ermey style,
SPEAKER_04: I think that would go way, way better for Devon. I think Hermes' arm is stronger than Devon's. It might be, but I just like that concentrating on the hand, concentrating on that, keeping that knuckle up, you know, being really aggressive in center, not trying to catch LeVon down here and wear him out. But we'll see. You got to make him go back up, boss. Tell him, say, no more messing around in the little class.
SPEAKER_00: Whenever I started organizing East vs West, a lot of people who are supposed to know about arm wrestling, they said, you are organizing way too many matches. Soon we will be out of matches. And it didn't work that way. I mean, if you keep arm wrestling around five, six guys and circle all the time,
SPEAKER_00: Then of course, but whenever you add new champions, new guys, since the mothers are giving birth to the kids every day, you know, so that small understanding is now gone. So I'm just saying that we will have a lot of matches. And then we will also make sure that there will be more women, more lighter categories. And what do you think about this card? Do you think that it's one of the best cards?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, I'm not as knowledgeable about all of them, but yeah, this is definitely a premier card for sure. Well, I would hope so, because I think I got knocked all the way into the first press conference. So there's like eight matches better than me now. Every time I lose, I move down the table a little bit more. Now I'm completely off.
SPEAKER_00: That is not because you're losing or something. It is like sometimes the level of the event is going up. Right now in this event we will have nine world title matches. Nine of them. I mean, the truth is that every time the time passes,
SPEAKER_00: world title matches are more meaningful than the previous ones because it's getting harder because they're like right now is the most recent best guy and yeah the things are getting harder and harder and we have nine of them in this upcoming uh event and even the non-world title matches like our lalatin versus desire no you versus kanai michael versus gennady
SPEAKER_00: Irina Galatkaya versus Brigitta Ivanović, both are world champions. And then Oğuzhan Kocak, world champion, his opponent Nugo is the one that pulled against Ravvigin Junior in the last event. So trust me, it is just like there are super, super talented guys, you know, and the world just needs to know who they are and we will make sure that they will get to know. So which is your favorite match?
SPEAKER_00: Which one is that? Certainly Devin and Oleg. Hmm. Okay. But, but just let, let's, let's leave it to the end. Okay. Let's leave it to the end. And so we start, let's start with, uh, do you know Irina Glatkaya and Brigitta Ivanfi? Brigitta is from Hungary and Irina Glatkaya is from, uh, Russia.
SPEAKER_04: I've seen Arena pull a few times. I have a hard time with, I thoroughly misjudge female arm wrestlers. I just don't, I can't, there's not enough consistency there for me to make a valid judgment, you know?
SPEAKER_00: Are you an armwrestling fan outside of you being an armwrestler? Do you watch videos other than your own? Do you spend time? Because some of the armwrestlers are crazy. They know about everything. Some of them are just focused on their own way. They know armwrestling, but they are not really crazy about what's going on every day. Yeah, I don't. I don't.
SPEAKER_04: not only i don't watch the videos that i'm in not only do i not want i don't watch the videos i make and post i'll film a video and post it and i haven't even seen it but no i don't watch the only time i watch my own matches is if if it's against an opponent i'm pulling again so since i've never pulled yoshi
SPEAKER_04: I haven't watched any of my own competition matches, but I've watched a lot of Yoshi matches. Just to analyze your openings. Yeah. And I've even emailed people and said, look, I can't find a lot of Yoshi matches because a lot of them have Japanese titles and stuff. So I've had other people send me videos of Yoshi. So I looked through, I've watched a lot of Yoshi's matches and I've watched those over and over and over again. But other than that,
SPEAKER_00: like i won't watch an oleg match or petrenko match until i have a match with him so i haven't i haven't watched any of his matches so you are just saying i'm only focused on my business i need to do the job very well and let me not blur my mind with other things just focus concentrate on one target you know yeah i'm trying to be a good employee i'm not trying to be your your press officer
SPEAKER_00: Okay, okay. So then you probably will not know about this. Azad versus Daniel. 70 kilo WAP champion of this year and 75 kilo. Okay. How about Nugo versus Oguzhan Kocak? Do you know Oguzhan Kocak?
SPEAKER_00: The Turkish guy that was 100-kilo world champion, and then he, like, last two years, he's not active. And he's pulling against the guy who beat Rob Vigence. Yeah, wasn't John supposed to pull him at King of the Table? Yeah, but John said that he didn't recover after the Leonidas match. Okay. I didn't watch. I only watched match one of Nugo versus RVJ.
SPEAKER_04: that's only because somebody said nugo mentioned my name at the end so i said so he did and i was so someone brought the tape to to practice that showed that i watched round one because i was curious about about rvj's shape you know when he got when he has that king of the table so but he's opening the turkish guy you don't know much about i might know him if i saw him and i don't since i'm on my phone i can't look at the card so i can't remember his face okay
SPEAKER_00: Artur Makaro versus Omer Kozakoğlu. Probably you don't know them either. Omer is the current 80 Kilo World Champion. Artur is our East versus West 77 Kilo World Champion. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I vote for him. I like him. Okay. Yeah. Until we go to the more familiar matches to you. Yeah. Dimitrina Petrova versus Karolina Pettersson. Dimitrina is the one that pulled against Ayane from Japan.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I know both of those girls. I think Demetrina is stronger and maybe a more accomplished arm wrestler, but I think Carolina beats her. You are saying she's going to topple her and beat her? I think Carolina will figure out how to win that match, even though I think Demetrina. I think Demetrina is favored and Carolina wins. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: How about this American guys versus Japanese guy? Well, you got to watch the Japanese versus Americans because they sometimes go early and then it takes like years for America to jump into that and then it goes America's way at the end. Especially when Japan and Germany are on the same side. But I like the American guy in that match.
SPEAKER_00: okay if it was in hawaii if it was in hawaii the japanese guy would have a have an advantage okay and oleg versus betty oniani do you remember betty in the last event i think he beat artem taino in istanbul for the left hand world title 95 because the guy with the beard and very
SPEAKER_04: I think BetKili has a very good chance, but I don't bet against Oleg Zolt. Is it because you like him or you think he's stronger? A little from A, a little from B. My predictions are not based on science. A lot of them are based on who I want to win or my friends.
SPEAKER_00: like the you you you you whenever it's about your match you do all kind of calculation and yeah my matches are basically yeah yeah and then whenever it's not your match it's like sorry i cannot tire my mind you know i just want this guy to win exactly if i'm not the favorite in my match i will tell you and i'll have a pretty good odds of what of where my odds are yeah i i will i will i will try not to uh set you in a match that you don't believe that you have chance
SPEAKER_00: Okay, but this one is very interesting. I am sure that, like, you will be interested, I think, Reno versus Sago. I think Sago wins that easily. Easily? They both go shoulder press, and Sago, I think, is stronger. I think Sago wins that easily. Yeah, Sago's press is...
SPEAKER_04: is phenomenal and right now he is even one category heavier than the time that you guys pull against each other yeah i don't know if the weight classes make that much one one weight class up probably doesn't affect stuff too unless he had a real unless he had to cut a lot of weight yeah yeah he had to he said he can't lose weight anymore so his body wants to be 253 yeah so in that case also um
SPEAKER_04: I pulled Sog off in his very first East versus West. So he had to get used to all that stuff. He's pulled in East versus West lovely events a while now. So he's going to be, I think Sog off wins. And I wouldn't be surprised if he wins every single one of them.
SPEAKER_00: Were you surprised when he held Chance very low and hook him and beat him? Whenever you try to go inside, you try to control Chance's pronator, usually you have a hard time. People usually beat him from his hand. Did you see that match or no? I did. I can't do that to Chance.
SPEAKER_00: no i'm impressed with sagov i i think he i i think he's uh i think he's in the i think he's in the top of his weight classes here okay another question to you since you think that sago is gonna win just say that if sago really wins as you uh think and then if he pulls devon in 115 he's pulling style he he can also pull the same effectively without risk as well
SPEAKER_04: Do you think that he has any chance against Devon's open arm top row? I don't think anybody's going to press Devon. But Gennady is some kind of, like, it is this, why Devon have to come in? Yeah, and I think if Devon pulls Gennady again, if Gennady tries to press, Devon will hook him right in and take care of him. I don't think anybody's going to press Devon and beat him.
SPEAKER_04: I don't even know if LeVon would come across the table like that. LeVon was good going sideways towards the peg, not crossing the center time. Sagov is good. I really, really like him. He's got all the advantages in this match, but he needs to develop an outside move if he's pulling Devin.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think that someone who is only going inside can suddenly become a great outside puller. It might take 15 years. But Devon said that in 15 years, Devon will not be competitive anymore, I believe. When I asked Devon about Jerry, Devon said he cannot beat Jerry with outside. He said that he has to also do the same way.
SPEAKER_04: well he stops yeah he stops jerry's hand right right at center yeah you know and prevents jerry from getting that show see this is what i was talking about with with yoshi when some when people fold yoshi's hand over he's able to get that wrist comes up he's able to get that shoulder and impress it when devin pulls jerry jerry tries to get that shoulder and devin's just got that hand
SPEAKER_04: and he prevents that shoulder from ever engaging the way uh which is also how devin stops michael todd's top roll is he stops it right there at top dead center which is how about if devin goes that open on top roll against jerry then i think jerry wins okay that is why i said that yeah so yeah i think i think a press beats a top roll i think a press beats a top roll
SPEAKER_04: more often than not an inside move beats a press and devin's got a deadly inside move and he's tall enough to hit it off center to almost look like he's flat wristed but what he's really doing is he's stopping the guy from pressing so yeah okay what do you think about uh david do you follow like you follow his matches when you are at the event
SPEAKER_04: david samusha yeah he won nine yeah i think i think i think david samusha wins every match for the next five years i think he becomes the east verse west's best legend i think he goes whatever under i think he ends up with like a 50 and zero record or something i do not think that guy can get beat
SPEAKER_00: Okay, just think that way. If this guy, usually this guy is around 90 kilos, he loses 5 kilos to make 85. Just instead of losing 5 kilos, if he gains like 5 kilos and just becomes really solid 95, do you think that he would have chances against you or he better stay in there? Because he says that he wants, right now, he won 9 world title matches, so 3 permanent belts.
SPEAKER_00: And then he wants to win three more and he wants to have four permanent belts and then want to go up and pull against Pauline first. And then he wants to probably say that, do you think that because of his structure, you know,
SPEAKER_04: he he doesn't have chance or he may have chance if he gets bigger he has a chance what he's going to have to contend with is i don't think the weight in the different classes is so important but when he starts pulling taller people taller people are going to be able to get farther out on his hand put some more leverage into it so he'll be as strong except that he's going to give up a little bit leverage and he's going to feel it so
SPEAKER_04: he'll do fine little guys can jump up in weight classes a lot a lot of them do over time anyways at his current weight class i don't know if anybody beats him one weight class up i think he's a top two or three person i think you should just give him a match you put him in that you put him in the 95 there is there is probably you will be there
SPEAKER_04: Do you think that he can make top three when you guys are present there? I think he's as good as all three of us. Yep. Yeah, Irakli is probably his hardest. I think Irakli would be his hardest. And considering I've never beat Rustam, I think Samusha has a better chance against Rustam than he does Irakli. Okay, there is one guy who says,
SPEAKER_04: Just old joke. We need more cooking video from Godzilla. When I get to the 95-kilogram class, you'll see a lot of cooking videos. Why is that? Because you will be more careful about what you are eating? Yeah, because I won't be so short in the class. I don't know. You'll probably see a hook video of Godzilla on November 2. So tell them to buy their CoreSports pay-per-view.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And so you are saying I'm not going to even ask you the match because you said nobody can beat Samusha. Okay. Vitaly Laletin versus Giorgi Deserano. After this, we have only four matches left. Do you know Deserano? Did you see him against Rivas? I know him. I know him well. I would think...
SPEAKER_04: I think Vitaly has untapped potential. I just don't think he performs as good as he could. I think Georgie wins. And I think Georgie wins convincingly. Oh, Georgie DiGiorno is going to beat Vitaly. That's what you are saying. Yep.
SPEAKER_04: I think Vitaly should, but Vitaly does not arm wrestle as good as he should considering how big he is. And I don't know why, and I'm not criticizing him. I'm just saying you've got all the tools. You just don't, you know. I think Vitaly should be in the top two of the super heavyweights. So I think Yorgi beats Vitaly.
SPEAKER_00: Wow. Wow. Deserano is going to beat. And you said pretty convincingly. That's interesting. Okay. Now your featured category. Georgi Tautiev versus Irakli Zirakashvili. Do you know who Tautiev is? A little bit. Okay. I will give you some information. Like he many times beat Hacim Razzolev.
SPEAKER_00: And he won the Russian AMC event in 95, but won before he was in 105 kilo. And he had a final with Sago. One match, he top rolled him and Sago still pressed him till here. And he lifted, lifted, and he won the match. But in the final, Sago beat him twice with the shoulder pressure. But he was not far.
SPEAKER_00: yeah so and then when the only like i can say that it's very hard to hook out here
SPEAKER_00: But people who beat him usually beat with outside, the same with the Irakli. Irakli almost impossible to hook, but people sometimes beat him, Ongarver beat him. Even you, when you do side pressure at the end, he lost his wrist, you know, some. And yeah, so how do you see this? And one more thing that Tautiev is two meters tall, like almost as tall as Alex Kurdeysen and Vital Laletin.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, really? Yeah. I'm still going with a Rockley. That's all impressive. I just think I think a Rockley's built a nest in that weight class. And I think it's going to be you're going to take a it's going to be hard to pry him out of there. So I think a Rockley wins, but I can't I don't know whether it's convincing or not.
SPEAKER_00: mm-hmm okay and then michael todd versus gennady quick winner this is my favorite match that like if somebody asked me there are 14 matches hanging which one do you want to see if you only have one to choose and i will just say this is the match i will choose yeah this is the one
SPEAKER_04: We talk about this match more than all the other ones, because I go to practice three times a week, and this match comes up more than any other one. And this is in America, so we all want Michael Todd to win, but then their last match, Michael Todd's Kings move was just not effective. Gennady was very comfortable with it, wasn't worried about it, and...
SPEAKER_04: And Michael Todd in Florida just Kings moved Camille right off the bat, which was probably the right move for Camille. But Michael Todd needs a completely different attack against Gennady than the last time they pulled. I just don't think he's... If Michael Todd doesn't completely change, let's see. If Michael Todd doesn't top roll and tries to Kings move or press, Gennady's going to win.
SPEAKER_00: But why do you think that it's not going to work this time? Sometimes you may do the same thing, but stronger. They're both stronger. But Gennady yesterday said that because Gennady tore his bicep. This is his first match in the last one and a half years, while Michael had three matches.
SPEAKER_00: Lamparelli, Lars, and then Kamil. And this is his coming back match. And we asked yesterday to Gennady. Gennady said he is 85%. And he said that he is 85%, but he said that is enough for him. But I don't think that when Gennady pulled against Michael first time, he was as strong as when he pulled Devin. Maybe at that time, he was also 85% compared to his Devin shape. I don't know. But I kind of see that Michael bigger, stronger.
SPEAKER_04: mentally and physically i think i i think all that's true but i don't think michael's problem with gnadi is strength or power i think it's technique and i never believe arm wrestlers when they tell me how strong they are or how weak they are because all arm wrestlers lie about that
SPEAKER_00: If an arm wrestler says he's 85%, that means he's like 105%. No, no, no. They all manage expectations. No, Gennady really, he had a very serious injury, and then he had a surgery, the things didn't go well, he had some tingling here, and many things, but he said that right now his pain is very strong, but his arm may not be there. I don't think that Gennady, because
SPEAKER_00: um like usually our masters don't say that i'm usually our masters say that they are i'm best shape on my life you know i'm coming like just to intimidate dopamine but you probably see the things differently let me ask you this if you ask an arm wrestler what is shape so when he says i'm 85 or an arm wrestler says i'm stronger than i've ever been based on what does that mean
SPEAKER_00: Probably the estimation of the weights that they are lifting, probably. Like whenever I asked Artur Makaro, I said, compared to the match that you beat Mindago Saracensis for the world title, where are you now? He said 25% stronger. I was like, how is it possible? But he said he's 25% stronger. And I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: Like when you ask a lot of arm wrestlers, they go, I'm stronger because I used to lift 100 kilos five times. Now I'm lifting 100 kilos seven times. So I'm 18% stronger. I go, it's the same weight. You didn't lift any more weight. You're not stronger.
SPEAKER_04: So I never know what people mean when they say there's, I mean, you tell me what your one rep max was then and now, and then I know exactly how much stronger you are. But being able to do the same weight more doesn't mean you're stronger. And 25% in three months is a lot. 25% strength increase in two years is a lot.
SPEAKER_00: Listen, if you are already a world level and world champion, it's very, very hard. I don't know what happened. There may be some reasons for that. If you are not at your best in the previous match that you are saying you are 25%, just imagine that you were at your 80%.
SPEAKER_00: and now you are at your hundred percent that you have achieved before and just put five percent more that i understand but if but whenever i ask him to arthur like is it your best shape ever he said no but my best shape ever was when i pull against you he told me
SPEAKER_00: and so so it is normal that somebody is coming back to their best shape but still if he beat mindagua saracitis with 25 less power it's mind-blowing because mindagua is incredibly stronger even though he doesn't really look like were you surprised to see how dominant mindagua was against taranenko that was that that was a very very impressive match i'm with you i just
SPEAKER_04: I'm not sure there's a 25% strength difference between four weight classes. I think you can move four weight classes and not find a 25% strength difference. No, you're right, you're right. If I lost 15% of my strength, I couldn't beat Carolina Peterson. I'm not sure how many people trust her. So I'll be honest, I think they just lie.
SPEAKER_04: i really don't know i i uh yeah okay uh so who's winning you are saying that gennady is winning unless michael i think gennady is a is a heavy heavy favorite unless michael todd shows up with some impressive travis major style top role and the videos he's posting of his training i don't see him training uh back pressure posting hand control so
SPEAKER_04: I mean, unless he... But this might be the ultimate... Yeah, I don't think... He doesn't need to improve his King's move. But this might be the ultimate sandbag. You know, he might be... The ultimate psychological warfare would be to make a whole series of videos of how you're not training, but put them out. So that your opponent, you know, goes, oh, he's going to do this. And then show up in top row, you know.
SPEAKER_00: so do you know how it is taught you are your type of person that like you don't watch other matches you only watch like your opponent just to analyze so you are very very strict in your belief that how arm wrestling should be as effective as possible
SPEAKER_00: and i agree with you i have my own uh ideas as well but but there are some other people they are still successful in in different ways and that is why for you to be apart like this probably doesn't make sense because you can't generate like all my statics were in a way that
SPEAKER_00: right after that that static pressure i could apply the maximum pressure so that i needed to keep that you know that angle the strongest uh elbow joint angle you know but they they have different uh strategies michael has a different strategy but i i think i i i understand you because but like whenever you said like he's gonna do this you
SPEAKER_00: Like, according to the devil, you are the worst technical. Or he said that just to tease you or something. But whenever I watch you, like, just because that is not the, like, people like to see this, this, you know. And then whenever you're giving up your wrist a little, not that you are giving up, because whenever you pull, automatically, if the guy also has a strong back pressure, it's making you box your wrist like neutral. But now...
SPEAKER_00: You both have the pronator and not wrist, and now you are in equal position, and now you guys are playing side pressure game where you are already, I mean, advanced compared to them. I understand that, like, you're probably thinking that once you neutralize your opponent's wrist, now you are like, come on, baby, let's play some side pressure game. And now my pronator is good, and I know how to sleep.
SPEAKER_04: And now, I kind of think that you... But it didn't work against Dadityan, probably he had a very strong wrist. Very strong and way a lot faster, a lot more power right off goal than I was expecting. My only point with Michael Todd and Gennady is, I think Michael Todd's capable of winning, but he can't do the exact same thing he did last time.
SPEAKER_04: All right. Gennady's got good hand, good, good high top roll. And Michael Todd's King's move was not effective against Gennady. So I only ever see Michael Todd King's move or press. I don't think I would ever try a press against the top roller. If I had to pull a posting top roller, a high knuckle top roller.
SPEAKER_04: I would be high knuckle top rolling and then try to transition to something else. So if Michael Todd comes up to the table on match one and sets up like this, you know, like Travis does, or sometimes Devin does and starts hitting these moves, I'm putting all my money on Michael Todd. But if he comes up and tries to do this stuff, I think Gennady's going to, I think it's going to go the way it did last time. If Michael Todd tries to press Gennady, I don't think that's going to work.
SPEAKER_00: I understand. Michael has a very good press, but not constant like Jerry's. He just hits. He works, works. If he doesn't work, he just switches back to the
SPEAKER_00: What's really impressive about Michael Todd is he can sometimes hit it and like a quarter way in decide it's not working and jump back out again. Yeah, yeah. When Jerry goes in, it's going. He doesn't have any brains. Yeah, forever, forever, yeah. There is no constant pressure with Michael. It's more like a one very strong hit, you know. Anyway, so Alijan Murado versus Ivan Matsushenko.
SPEAKER_00: 115 kilo left arm world title. You know both guys? I want Macho Shinko to win, but I think I don't know how to pronounce his name. I think he's the David Samusha of the left hand. I think even more dominant way. Samusha had many, many wars. In fact, this guy also had a war with Petrenko. I don't know if you remember the
SPEAKER_04: left arm match but so you are saying alijan is the favorite i think so i just go back to some i think samusha is so good he should have his own chair on stage that only he gets to sit in and i think alizon is a year away from getting his own chair okay so these two people should have their own like
SPEAKER_00: Like a throne, like a throne on stage that only they can sit in. Okay, but it needs to be not the chair, like a really good like king seat, huh? Yeah, with like hammers and swords and stuff sticking out of the back. I understand, yeah. And so let's go to the last match. Devon Larratt versus Oleg Petrenko. This is a match that at 105 kilo,
SPEAKER_00: And it looks like Devon still has 20 pounds to lose, a little bit 20, 24 pounds to lose in the last 10 days. And he already lost near 20 pounds, and he needs to lose another 20 pounds. But he's going to gain some weight back next day. And the losing that weight that you're going to gain till next day,
SPEAKER_00: like does it mean that you don't lose any power you think that that time like whenever you lose 20 pounds in last some days and then you get gain water back and then it doesn't mean that just because you weigh the same you don't lose anything you i'm asking your opinion or something yeah when i was in the wal i would cut
SPEAKER_04: I would cut between 12 and 18 pounds in the last six days. And the last 24 hours, I would cut somewhere between nine and 15 pounds. So if I cut 15 pounds in the sauna, I could put 17 pounds back on in the next 12 hours. And by the time I competed, I'd be the exact same weight.
SPEAKER_04: and i don't think it slowed me down at all i don't think i gave up any power i might have gave up some endurance i don't really understand the whole glycogen storage stuff but the trick to cutting the weight most people can can do putting the weight back on a lot of people mess that up but i think devin probably is aware of how to properly put the weight back on um that said i don't think the weight class from
SPEAKER_04: 105 to whatever he's coming from the 20 pounds or so. I wouldn't count on that affecting him at all. I think he's going to be as good.
SPEAKER_04: And Devin's not really a brute power arm wrestler anyways. He's a position and control type guy. He doesn't really smash people. He doesn't pull like Levin does or Pushkar. Pushkar was the ultimate brute power puller. He just smashed into people and put them out of the way. Devin's matches are long and they're technical and they're positional.
SPEAKER_04: You know, he's got a whole game plan that starts 24 hours before the refs say no movie. You think that he's not going to lose power in the last period? He might lose some, but I don't think he'll lose it where he matters. When Devin beat Michael Todd, he did it all with his hand. You know, he stopped, you know, and he beats Jerry Ketteret with his hand. So you are saying that we will see
SPEAKER_04: A Devon that pulled against Levan or not that much? I'm saying you'll see a Devon that pulled as good as he ever pulled when he used to weigh 230 pounds in the WAL. I mean, I think he'll be that strong. I think he was probably stronger in the super heavyweight class. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_04: but he wasn't he wasn't a super heavyweight for very long you know i mean levon didn't levon didn't get up to that weight in 12 months and then become world champ you know i mean he spent years putting that weight on so he had a big yeah but he is he is younger he's much younger you know and somehow i don't understand at this age devon is totally ripped you know
SPEAKER_00: Like if Devin was as bulk as Levan, he also would be probably 150 kilo or 40 kilo or something. Yeah, I wish you would have forced him to stay at super heavy weight. So Devin stayed 300 plus pounds. He said that he's exhausted. He said that he pushed himself so long that he wasn't healthy anymore. Like you remember every time we had a podcast, he was just eating.
SPEAKER_04: Every time, he's just eating, eating, eating, and still he is 265. It's harder gaining weight than losing weight. Anyways, I think Devin's the favorite, but I think Oleg's got probably the best shot at beating him at this weight.
SPEAKER_04: I think Oleg wins match one cause Devin usually loses match one. It's usually a, either they get slant. It usually ends pretty quickly. And then Devin tightens up his shoulder, stops it and turns into that goofy little hook, press, high hook, whatever, whatever that Devin move is called. And then he, um, he stretches the match way out. If Petrenko can do match one, two or three times in a row,
SPEAKER_04: He's got a shot, but I think the betting odds on Devin are probably 60%, 70%. Yeah, so you are saying that, like, maybe match one... I think Oleg wins match one. I think Oleg's got a 99% chance of winning match one. And then match two probably will stop, you are saying, and then he will just slowly...
SPEAKER_04: in favor of Devin. If Oleg can duplicate match one, he wins. I think match three or four, whatever it goes, goes just as fast to Devin's side. When Devin stops a match and gets a hold of you, he bleeds you out for a long time. How about you? What's your chance about beating Devin? About the same as Oleg. 40%.
SPEAKER_04: But different. Oleg's going to pull Devin completely different than I am. Oleg's going to attack and go after Devin. I'm going to realize Devin's probably going to control the match and it's going to be a long match. So I would train for very, very long matches.
SPEAKER_04: And when he starts talking to the refs and all that stuff, I'm just going to go sit down until he's done. I'm going to be up there, and as soon as Devin looks at the ref, I'm just going to go sit down and take a nap, get a sandwich. I'll come back. You can just have Anna call me when Devin's done talking, and then I'll come back and arm wrestle. I think your advantage is right now that you, how to say, you...
SPEAKER_00: you don't need so much of your wrist like you as long as you have your pronation then you can still apply that side pressure so taking your wrist is not like only solution somebody needs to also control your pronator as well yeah so that that is why you know like if Petrenko somehow loses his wrist
SPEAKER_04: I am not sure if he can apply that side pressure as effective as you apply. So that is the thing, yeah. He's going to certainly have to protect his hand. Because Devin's hand is phenomenal. And it's large. So he gets a lot of leverage advantage off of that. But Petrenko's smart. And he beats... I mean, what he did to Angerbaev was absolutely amazing. And like you said, his left-handed match with Alizan is an eye-opener. So...
SPEAKER_04: I think Oleg might be able to do what John Brzenk did, stay in that middleweight range and compete at heavyweight and super heavyweight. He might be one of these all-around technical masters. I think he needs more of the...
SPEAKER_00: and control and yeah, I think it's strong, but the console is something different to do adjustments with your end. Yeah, but that'll come because he hasn't. When was his first East First West event? He was John Bursink. Yeah, but he was just like two, three months training after long break. Yeah, yeah. After three years. Yeah. Like all of us, he's getting better, but he might be getting better faster because he's had less time.
SPEAKER_04: If anything, no matter how this match goes, when they have a rematch, Oleg's odds go up 10% in my estimation. I'll give Oleg a 10% to 15% odds bonus on their next match just because arm wrestling Devin is a unique experience. It's like the first time you go to Las Vegas. You don't know what to expect, and it takes a while to get used to it before you can think correctly. He's got a good shot now. He has a better shot on the rematch.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you very much, Taz. Thank you very much. It was very interesting. As always, you are a smart guy and you know how to do those breakdowns. And see you in Istanbul in nine days, probably. Nine days. I'll be there. Thanks, boss. Take care. And you want your room at the seaside, right? Where the cars are going. I will kick somebody out on the railroad side.
