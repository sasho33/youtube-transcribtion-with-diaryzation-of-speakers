SPEAKER_03: Hello, hello, everyone.
SPEAKER_00: They will have guests, Ivan Matyshenko and Artem Morozov. Maybe a surprise guest as well, but it is not certain, so I don't want to mention. Let me share the link and then with you guys.
SPEAKER_00: Hello, hello, already a lot of people. Hello, guys. I'm a bit tired, training nonstop. Hello, Todd and Oleg's love child, greatest promoter, greatest pronator. He says, thank you very much.
SPEAKER_00: I start training regularly. Today I did some chest. Yesterday I did mostly brachioradialis type of training. Let's see who came. Artem Morozov came. Who is this giant? Like, what are you?
SPEAKER_00: I cannot hear you. Oh, hello. Now I hear you. How are you? I'm good. What happened to you? What are you now? 500 kilo? 130 kilo. 130 kilo. Wow. You look big. You look big. Everything. Already look at the t-shirt. I can see your trapezius, everything.
SPEAKER_00: Seriously. Wow. Giant. How are you, Andy? Good, good. Can you put the camera somewhere? No? Like, because it's already moving all the time, but... This? No, no. Sideway, but you need to put somewhere. Ah, okay. Like, yeah. Because if you're holding your hand, it is, like, moving so much. Aha. Oh. Good. Ah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. So now, very soon, Ivan will join. So how are you? Good? Yes, I'm good. Yes. Good? That's good. That's good. Ten minutes ago, I go to... No, no train. Hammam.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, hammam. Okay. Sauna. Sauna, yeah. Yeah. Hammam and sauna, little difference. Sauna is too hot. Hammam is normal. Yeah. Yeah. I can see you are red. Yeah. Russian language sauna is banya. Banya. Banya. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Russian sauna is very hard, very hot. Yeah, yeah. And how is it in Kazakh language? Monsha. Monsha. For hammam? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay, I think Ivan came. Hello, Ivan. Hello. Hello, Ivan. Hello, Artyom. Hello, Ivan. Hello.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, how are you, Ivan? Good, thank you. Ivan, do you think that when you look at the...
SPEAKER_00: videos of Ali Can, do you think that you will be meeting the best version of Ali Can? Yes, I think that he is going to get bigger, stronger. He seems to be bigger, actually. I never saw him this big. Yeah, this is what I was thinking, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And can you ask Artem what does he think about Alijan? Does he think he's just regular Alijan or is he getting bigger? Artem, do you think Alijan is as usual or is he gaining weight? I think he's still around 105 kg.
SPEAKER_01: A lot of things are the same. Alizhan is the same.
SPEAKER_00: But we'll see on the scales. Yeah, we will see. We will see. Yeah, you're right. Artem said that he is 130 kilos right now. And what are you now? 115? 14. 114. Okay. And how is your elbow? Everything? You feel healthy? You know, I had a break. One month break after Artem. And now I do not work with big weights.
SPEAKER_01: and now it seems to be better than it was uh all the preparation for it now it seems to be better but i do not work with big weights so far and just uh just um raise them a little because you are healthy you know yes right now i'm healthy
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I seem to be healthy, but I'll know that when I try bigger weights, I think. Yeah, but the question is, right now you are not pushing your limits. If you wanted to push your limits next training, do you think you cannot do your match? Yes and no. Certainly not.
SPEAKER_01: Right now I'm healthier, but I'm not stronger than I was before, Artyom. I'm healthier, but when I get to my peak in one and a half months, in six, seven weeks, I think it could be bad. But I'm not sure. Time will show.
SPEAKER_01: And Artem, how is your form right now? You seem to be bigger. And how is your form right now? Well, now... Ivan, can you translate it? Now... I even added in some exercises, to compare before the fight with Vitaly, I added...
SPEAKER_01: He added a little strength in some exercises, but mostly some base, so to say, general
SPEAKER_01: not specific arm wrestling exercises. He wanted to gain some weight, but he didn't manage to. He was 130 and he is 130. But he made some progress in those exercises. Yeah, he was 130 and still 130, but he looked bigger. How is that? Because his body percentage, fat percentage is lower or what? Yes, yes. That's what it is? Yes.
SPEAKER_01: That's good, that's good. Artem, how do you see your chance against Kurdesha with right hand? Do you expect a harder match? Of course, I want to win. I really want to win, because I'm tired of losing with my right hand. I want to win. But we'll see. It depends on what Alex does.
SPEAKER_01: He wants to win. He added some strength. He's ready. It will depend on how strong Alex is also. But he will do his best. He's tired of losing with his right hand. He wants to win.
SPEAKER_01: and um well he'll do his best i understand like last time um is there any expression he will fight as it is his last fight okay okay yeah but he lost his last two matches
SPEAKER_00: One was against Georgi Svetkov. Of course, you had some stomach problems, but you also lost against Laletin. If you want to have really big dreams, you cannot lose again, right, Artem? Translate, Ivan, I didn't understand everything. Well, he says that you lost to Svetkov, although objectively you were in uniform. You lost to Laletin, and now it's important for you, if any...
SPEAKER_01: Exactly. He didn't expect Vitaly to be so fast, actually. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_00: and so basically artom you see your chance against kurdesha what 50 50 or what no no 50 50 95 95 95 who alex oh my my okay 95 and how do you see this match you want
SPEAKER_00: I think it is somewhere 60-40 in Artem's favor. Okay, but how do you see that? How do you see, like, how do you see the match is going? Actually, I don't see Alex much. I remember his top eight fights and against Prisimir. It was also top eight. It was long ago.
SPEAKER_01: yeah but i remember that he had some problems with and shoulder press he had some problems so you are saying that he's gonna take artem's risk and artem is gonna fight him i'm not sure that he will be able to take artem's risk because uh the level is very high and it is rather difficult but uh it is also possible it depends on alex
SPEAKER_01: much and it's difficult to predict. Yeah, it's very difficult. Like Jerry won against him, but Jerry has very weird style, you know, a different style. Yes, but we can remember left hand, Artem's left hand. Yeah, he hooked him, yeah. Yes, and I think the technique, Alex's technique is the same. But what about the strength level?
SPEAKER_01: So it may be something like with the left hand, but I think that with the right, Artem's hook is better than his left. Just my opinion, but maybe Artem knows better. Artem, is your hook better on the right now, do you think, or on the left? On the right, in principle, everything is better, stronger. I assumed that your right hook is stronger too.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I'm not even close to the left. Well, in exercises, for example, on blocks somewhere. Well, I overdo it a little, again. I lay down on the right and it works. Artem says that his right is better than his left. He knows exercises and he feels it better. And left hands.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I understand. And what does he think about some other matches on the card? There is Kacper, I don't know how to pronounce his last name, and Nedalin Hristo. Are you familiar with these guys, Artem? Are you familiar with the names of the participants on your card?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, then it's hard to predict. Okay, let's talk about
SPEAKER_00: Alden versus Korean Hulk. Alden. You think Alden is going to win? Yes. Okay. And Georgi Svetko versus Kalinichenko. Oh, I think Kalinichenko win because his finger, very, very strong finger and wrist.
SPEAKER_00: And do you think that Georgy Svetkov's wrist is not strong? Georgy Svetkov, side pressure, not strong. Not strong, but top roll? Top roll, very strong. Okay. Artem, we put the strap, Kalinchenko on, Georgy Svetkov. Top roll versus top roll. They both hit top roll. Who is his wrist like this?
SPEAKER_00: uh kalinichenko wrist but not a little bit a little bit yes okay and how he wins he wins with side pressure or shoulder pressure or tight pressure side pressure and back pressure okay so first back pressure and then yes like this sideway okay
SPEAKER_00: So you are saying Kalinchenko is the winner because Georgi Swetko, good top row, but not super good side pressure. Yes. I understand. And you, Ivan, what do you think about this match? I would bet on Georgi because he is bigger. But also very difficult to predict. Because Kalinchenko is getting better and better.
SPEAKER_01: He makes progress all the time and he's becoming bigger. So I will not be surprised that he is already on another level. But if it was maybe two years ago, Georgi 100% would win. But right now, I saw Georgi. Georgi is also bigger now. Yes, yes. Muscle and everything. I would still bet on Georgi, but I'm not sure at all.
SPEAKER_00: maybe by little maybe like 55 45 yes uh okay okay i understand and so we have rob vision jr nugo i i think win he he show uh versus margarine
SPEAKER_01: very good match yeah stronger yeah strong strong yes and not very wind versus uh yeah okay and what do you think you want oh did rob pull at east west oh he pulled against uh but he was before uh broke his arm
SPEAKER_01: Before. Who won the... Zurab won. Zurab? I try to remember that match. I saw very few matches of Rob. I think I saw it against Zurab, but that's it. I would bet on Nugo, but I saw very little of Rob.
SPEAKER_01: But Nuga is very impressive. He's rather small, but very strong. Yeah, he's not... I like the way he pulls. Yeah. That energy. And especially that he is a small guy. A rather small guy. I mean, he's not so tall, but he's just like very thick, you know. Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_00: i mean his his levels his levels are not 105. maybe i have a question for our art if you beat alex kudesha would you be interested to pull someone like michael todd uh
SPEAKER_01: and i like how he fights he's like a gentleman fighting with respect so i would be interested in such a technique well how can i cope with such a technique interesting ivan i looked at the dog i with artyom will be interested in michael todd
SPEAKER_00: It would be a good experience. Okay, he talked that short? Okay. Actually, I watched the joke. It distracted my attention. Okay, I understand. And, Artem, like, probably you never pull
SPEAKER_01: against someone like Michael? Do you think it would be dangerous for you to pull against someone like Michael? I think his technique is very uncomfortable for everyone.
SPEAKER_01: and that is why it's so interesting for him to get to know how he would cope with it. He wants to try it himself and see what he can do. Does he think that Gennady will win or Michael will win?
SPEAKER_01: They will have a fight. I don't know if Gennady will recover well after his injury. If he is ready, then there will be a fight. And I still think that this time, since Michael Todd started to gain weight and rehabilitate very well, I think there will be a serious fight where Michael Todd will win this time.
SPEAKER_01: If Gennady doesn't have time to recover, Michael Todd can go into the 30s, as we all know, and break through there. 50-50. You say 50-50, but before that, Michael, most likely, right? Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_01: So it's probably Michael's favorite, right? Yes, I think it's Michael. It's hard for me to guess. They had a fight already. It's difficult to say, Artem. As he doesn't know what's the shape, what's the form of Gennady, has he managed to recover after his injury? On the other hand, he knows that Michael had great progress lately. And he's becoming also bigger and stronger.
SPEAKER_01: So he thinks that if Gennady is not 100% ready, Michael would win even, he said, using shoulder press. But I didn't understand that, actually, what he meant. Maybe Gennady's bicep is injured and with the shoulder pressure.
SPEAKER_01: you know maybe yes yes if he's not ready even with his shoulder uh yeah so he says that he doesn't need even do this if he cannot he's not healed up yes um but it's difficult to say and finally but uh but uh i think he thinks that uh michael has more chances oh okay in your opinion
SPEAKER_01: About the same. I know that Gennady can be extremely strong and versatile and he has great endurance as well as Michael. If he's 100% ready and Michael 100% ready, I think it could be 50-50.
SPEAKER_01: But now I saw that Michael is getting better and that now he's another level than he was several months ago. He's getting heavier. Heavier and stronger. When he fought Camille, he seemed to be much better. And I didn't see Gennady.
SPEAKER_00: But I think Gennady wouldn't accept the match if he doesn't think that he will be ready. We don't know if it's 100%, but I think he believes that he will be ready enough to compete against Michael. Yeah, we will see. So it looks like Michael, according to your opinion and Artem's opinion, is a very dangerous puller.
SPEAKER_00: I think he already has proved this when he is in his best. Even when he lost against Denis Diplenko, he gave him very hard time. You know, he won some rounds. Even when he lost against Pushkar, first two rounds he won. So I don't understand why some people really underestimate Michael. I think that is because he had some bad times when he lost weight, when he lost from Garbaev, actually 105.
SPEAKER_00: was not the same michael for several maybe for two years yeah i agree yeah anyway so the last match uh devon versus leonidas with left arm and i i know that leonidas left arm is probably as good as his right arm and
SPEAKER_00: Devin lost weight to 105 kg and now he is around 115 kg. How do you see these matches?
SPEAKER_01: Devon will do the show again. He will let him fight, pull him out of the pillow, make fun of him. Unfortunately, there are no chances there. Well, not unfortunately, there are simply no chances for Leonidas to cope even with the left. Sorry.
SPEAKER_01: Leonidas, Artyom says that Leonidas has no chances to win this match and that Devin would let him to do his best. He will make sure but Leonidas has nothing to do here. I have a question for Artyom. Artyom, do you think that
SPEAKER_00: When Devon is not super heavyweight, when Devon is lighter, is the same guy, same power? Did you think that Chen Xiao versus Devon, Devon is the same guy that played against Levon? No, I don't think so. He probably lost some of his strength.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I think now he fights with everyone, just makes a show. He knows that he is stronger, but still lets people fight. In the same fight with James Shaw, it was noticeable. And this time it will be exactly the same, I'm sure.
SPEAKER_01: She thinks that for sure Devon is not that strong as he was when he was bigger. But still, he makes show in all of his matches, including against Chance Shaw. So still, he's very strong. Yeah, but the question is,
SPEAKER_00: you know when when john brzing pulled leonidas do you know john brzing was 112 kilo 112 kilo john was and we saw john in such positions against leonidas do you think that when john is 112 kilo um john's right arm is weaker than devon's left arm when devon is light devon
SPEAKER_01: Maybe you translate, maybe just to make sure that he understood correctly. Jonko fought against Leonidas, he weighed 113 kilos, and he opened his fist to him. What do you think, is he right in comparison with the left Devon? Well, it doesn't depend on what...
SPEAKER_01: hand, that is, it depends on what the difference is between the right and left of Leonidas, I'm sure that Leonidas' left hand is weaker than the right one, I'm sure of that for some reason I don't know and again John's hand is shorter Devon's hand is longer and
SPEAKER_01: Sorry, there is some noise in my phone. I don't know where from.
SPEAKER_00: So, you don't hear us? Artem said that he is sure that Leonid's left hand is not so strong as his right hand. It is. It is about the same. In fact, it was even better before. Right now, he trained his right. So now, maybe a little bit right is better, but a little bit. Because normally, his left arm is the dominant arm. And also the touch of also the lever.
SPEAKER_00: Devon's level is much longer. Yes. So it will be a problem. My question is, you remember the last time when John and Devon pulled, John was about to win the round one. He was like that close with right arm versus right arm. Does he think that he's, and it was not like, I don't know how light he was then. Maybe he was as light as today, but like, does he think that Devon's left arm is stronger than John's right arm? This is my question.
SPEAKER_01: When John is heavy, like 112 kilos. He doesn't think it is weaker, but it is more uncomfortable for
SPEAKER_00: only because of the eyes and the hand and wrist yeah riser yeah so maybe maybe he thinks that devon's left arm here is stronger than maybe jones and what is your opinion ivan i think that javan is heavy favorite and um
SPEAKER_01: I do not see Leonidas winning this match. Yes. But do you expect like a domination like this or it will be a tough match? No, no, I think it will be a long fight for endurance. The main problem is that I didn't see
SPEAKER_01: good shoulder press. I didn't see Leonid's shoulder press. And because he doesn't have this move, it would be very difficult to... Yeah. So you are saying that possible to take it here, but here he cannot finish this way. He needs to finish that way. Yes. And I think that Devon's endurance is much better. Okay. I understand. I understand.
SPEAKER_00: he will not be able to pin him okay but his endurance will not be enough to finish him or he will not be much stronger to dominate him the match will stop doesn't matter where and he's he will guess out this is what you are saying i think so okay okay arson right now you have a very very very very tough question arson very tough question
SPEAKER_01: how can i say damn it's hard for me but for me if you compare my fight at that moment it seemed to me that alizhan
SPEAKER_01: He will be a little faster, a little more explosive and stronger, in my opinion. But again, I haven't fought Alizhan for a very long time. When we fought, he weighed lighter, and I was weaker. Well, damn, it's hard for me to say. 50 to 50. The main thing is that endurance is not let down. This will be a very interesting fight. In general, it is not difficult.
SPEAKER_01: Who do you think is more resilient? You and me. I don't know. Alizhan likes to fight. He likes to fight often. He fights with two hands all the time. That's the difficulty. He has a little more stamina. I haven't seen his long fights either. He didn't really get nervous.
SPEAKER_01: Well, there was a long fight, for example, with Oleg Topopetrenko, and that's it. But, again, endurance, here, Olzhan holds so tight. It's hard for me to say. It was hard for me and you. And when I fought with him, he beat me too, but it was a long time ago. And it's hard for me to reason now. 50 to 50, I think. Arjun thinks it's 50-50. When we pulled in June,
SPEAKER_01: Stoyan Bumbalov – Artyom thought that. Stoyan Bumbalov – Maybe a little stronger and more explosive power, but he's not sure because he didn't. Stoyan Bumbalov – For.
SPEAKER_01: long time and last time they pulled uh he was weaker Artyom was weaker and Alizhan was smaller so it's difficult for him to say he says 50 50 and uh he thinks that my problem can be uh endurance do you do you agree do you agree that your endurance will be left
SPEAKER_01: I do not think that endurance will be the main factor here. I think whose wrist would be stronger. I think it would matter.
SPEAKER_01: So you are saying that the one that controls the pronator stronger, faster, they will have the edge. Baba, will it be enough to finish it? Because this is more like... Alizhan has more... How to say? More power? More ways. Alizhan also can, I think, there is a chance of him holding me in a supernative position.
SPEAKER_00: But I do not think that I will manage to hold him in defensive position, even if I control his pronator. Alezhan also has strong biceps. Okay, you are saying that your chance is to be at the offensive position. It will be very hard for you to be defensive and stop him. You are saying that he has chance to stop you here, but your chance to stop him here and then still win, it will be harder.
SPEAKER_00: yes i do not see myself stopping him somewhere in the first position okay so you are you are basically your only chance is that to be offensive and finish him there um most probably most probably yes okay i agree with you i agree with you i agree that that your hand and wrist domination with this speed i kind of like
SPEAKER_00: Like I see true speed, the one speed with the whole body moving that way. And there is another speed with this. I think here you are very fast. You are very fast with this speed. But he is also fast this way. But I think that for him to go that way, he needs to...
SPEAKER_00: protect this angle. If you just put him here so quickly, he won't be able to go. And I think that your risk domination over the pronator is very good. So I kind of see that Alnus is much, much, much stronger than you. I think that you're going to put him to the, you know, this position, but you can finish him or you cannot finish him. I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_00: me too yeah yeah yeah it it is incredible that that match is um incredible like i just i cannot imagine any bigger match with left arm in 115 kilo there is no bigger match you know yes and we will see maybe there should be some other match between petrenko and alejan as well in 105 because their first match wasn't that uh easy and i believe it was 95.
SPEAKER_00: It was 95. No, it was 105. No? 105. Yeah. It was 105. And I think that both of them progressed a lot. Progressed a lot, yeah. The question for Artem. Artem, you told me that you are ready to compete next year with left arm against Laletin. Yes. And you, at the beginning of the program, you said that your left hurts.
SPEAKER_00: Are you sure that you will be ready for like January or something with left arm against Laletin? Yes, I'm ready. I'll be ready. But how can you be sure that you will not have pain anymore? I don't have pain. My pain going to...
SPEAKER_00: Right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Because right now you're pressing with the right, so you have pain here. Left, you rest now. It's okay. Yes. Yes. Okay. And do you, do you, what, how do you believe your chances against Laletin? Do you, do you think that who is, who is more dangerous for you? Laletin or Ali Canmurado? Because those are the ones that
SPEAKER_00: you didn't pull also there is there is kamil company stylistically also very dangerous but who is the most dangerous guy for you more dangerous for me because his his hand longer yeah leverage yeah and strong hand right very strong yes
SPEAKER_00: and very explosive to the pin pad, yeah, hard to stop. I will tell you something, Artem. I remember after the match, I told you, you know, you are not super fast guy. You are not. Many times you stop people and then win. You stop people, just like Dave Chaffee match, Rewaz match, Ivan Matyshenko match, like many times you catch people and then win. Very seldom you go like this.
SPEAKER_00: And Vitaly Laletin is one of the most explosive guys, very fast guy. And you did not start the match with so much loading. You were like starting normal. You should be starting because you are slow, sorry, but you are slow. And then when, if you do the same start with Laletin,
SPEAKER_00: When you have only 80%, Laletin will hit you with 100% because he is explosive. So you had to, before the goal, you really need to do a lot of back pressure, back pressure, like Hermes did against Laletin. Really back pressure, back pressure. Now you have, before the goal, you have 100%.
SPEAKER_00: And then stop him. Even when Hermes gave everything, Hermes stopped him right here. But you, you didn't do so much pressure. You started normal. That's why it's almost impossible to stop Laletin. Do you agree or not? Well, you're right. I've now made up my mind that I won't fight honestly. I will always push. He agrees.
SPEAKER_01: And now he made up his mind not to pull fair. Not to be fair when pulling. And he will use back pressure before. Yeah, but left arm. Can he top roll with left arm? Can you top roll with your left arm? Yes, I can.
SPEAKER_01: In general, it has always been so that I fought on the left and on the top. That is, in all, for example, tournaments. Because my elbow always hurt, and I tried to fight on the top. That's basically what I'm doing now. That is, I train the top on the left to be stronger. And on the right too. I try to make my top better.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, he thinks he's more a top-roller. With left arm? Yeah, with both, left and right. But with left even more because his elbow hurts. But why did he hook Kurdecha if he wants to be a top-roller? Because Kurdecha is stronger here? Why did you hook Kurdecha? I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: He thought that hook would be more effective.
SPEAKER_01: and after trying cook but it was not so effective as he thought it would be and after that he tried top roll but by that time had no power he was exhausted and what do you think
SPEAKER_00: about him like do you do you how do you see your chance like so you're gonna top roll are you telling yes you're gonna top roll yes i'm gonna top roll and how do you see even if you want to smile in them but i don't know why i just thought that i was going through
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you have no chance other than hook against anyone. I mean, if it is super away. Yeah, you're right. And do you do you think that anyone I heard I remember this, I don't know with left arm is beating Vitaly left arm with outside like more like back pressure and then side pressure.
SPEAKER_00: And do you think that Morozov can do that to him or do you think that nobody can beat him? I think it will be difficult for Artem to do it. But hooking him is also difficult. Left hand I can see only Lewand
SPEAKER_00: That one is not going to pull left arm anymore. That one's wrist is messed up. He doesn't want to pull left arm. I'm not sure how hard Artyom tried to top roll me. I think not so hard. But it's difficult to say. It's difficult to say. But just remember one thing. One thing remember. Artyom trying to top roll you
SPEAKER_00: who is a hook puller. Artem to top roll Vitaly, who is a, you know, outside puller. So when two people are going outside,
SPEAKER_00: The main thing is your hand's power as well. You know, like when two goes out, who is weak will go like this. But whenever you are hook puller, you don't really attack to his hand, you just attack his, you know, grenade. So it is kind of different. Like whenever Vitaly and Artem hit each other, it is more important how strong Artem's hand.
SPEAKER_00: But whenever Artem is trying to top roll you, it's not about his hand because you don't care about the hand. You spin it and go inside. So it is about his pronator. And of course, it's also important against top roll, but the main thing is the hand, you know. I don't care how the opponent is strong, the arm. If when we do top roll, if his wrist is moving that way, his brachioradialis will not help so much. This is my opinion. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so another thing.
SPEAKER_00: This is Aronov. How good is he? What do you think, Artem? You were in Dubai. Ivan was also in Dubai when he played against Rewaz. And I think Rewaz was, what, 165 kilos, 170 kilos? 175, 170. 170, 170 kilos. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: I think that's the way it is. Ziranov has grown physically stronger than he used to be.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, Ziranov has become much stronger than he used to be physically. And I also agree. I also agree. I didn't expect Ziranov to win Rivas so easily. In the way he won, yes. I didn't expect Ziranov to call him in losing position. He hooked him. I didn't expect him to uproll Ziranov and Rivas.
SPEAKER_00: But at that time, Rivas was maybe exhausted. So you are saying that maybe he was already exhausted. Okay, I understand. After the first or second round, Rivas seemed to be not fresh enough. So it just also shows that Deserano has very good endurance. Artem, do you talk with Deserano? Do you talk with him lately? I talk with Deserano.
SPEAKER_01: No, we did call, but we didn't talk about the fight. I didn't know he was going to fight, he didn't tell me. They call the coach, my coach Yedin Gital, they discuss the training process, and I think that's enough.
SPEAKER_01: Artyom says that they talked, but they didn't talk about the upcoming match. At that time, Artyom didn't know that Gyorgy. Okay, okay. But he knows that Dziranov talks with Artyom's coach, Yevgeny Gitarov, and he thinks that's enough. That would do him good. Artyom, do you think that Dziranov has
SPEAKER_00: chance to reach like around the top like does he have chances against maybe in the future maybe against Levan Laletin or Hermes like where is he where do you think that he can be who can he beat the top top higher ranked guys who can he beat you think can he beat Jerry Cadore can he beat Gennady can he beat Georgi Svetko can he beat Hermes
SPEAKER_01: Can he beat Devon? Can he beat Levon? What do you think? To understand how much he has potential to be in the top three, I need to watch at least one more fight. For example, I know that he will fight Vitaly. I need to watch this fight and then it will be clear
SPEAKER_01: Artyom says he needs to see Gyorgy against Vitaly. And after that, he will... Yeah, but before that, before that... But before that, it's a bit better for him to make it.
SPEAKER_00: So what do you think about who is going to win, you think? You pull against Vitaly. Do you think Deserano has a chance or not? I think he has a chance. But which way? Hook him? Side pressure? Deadrest? Or maybe top roll?
SPEAKER_01: Flop top roll. New technique. Flop top roll. So he goes outside and he loses his wrist, but still pronated. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Pin like this. Yes. Yeah. So he tries outside, but he loses his wrist, but still has the pronator and with side pressure maybe. Okay. Maybe like the way that Kalinichenko versus Giorgis Radko. You explain. Okay. Okay. I understand. I understand. Yeah. And Ivan, have you ever seen this, I don't know, beating
SPEAKER_01: Vitaly? At war for Europeans? Yes, I saw that. I think it can happen again. Both of the efforts became bigger. And now Zeran seems to be at that level. I would still bet on Vitaly. And I think most of the fights Vitaly won.
SPEAKER_01: But in some of them, he lost. It could be the same, I think. Maybe one round for Zeranoff, but other rounds for Vitaly. I would do something like that. Do you think that maybe Zeranoff may win the Supermatch as well because of his endurance?
SPEAKER_00: Does he have like 20% chance? 30% chance or no? 60, 40, 40, yes, 35, 40 I would give. Yeah, okay. So you are saying that, yes, Vitaly is favorite, but this Zerano also has good chance? Yes. Okay. Okay, that's good. That's interesting, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: we will see and then the last thing let's talk about uh we talked about the king of the table we talked about a few matches for the east versus west and then let's talk about the jerry versus levan uh artom were you surprised when jerry beat kurdecha
SPEAKER_01: It's not a surprise, because Alex had acclimatization. Plus, I know that Alex had a son two months ago. And it's clear that it was hard for him to prepare, because it's sleepless nights. It's all when a little child is in your arms. It's hard, of course, to sleep and you have to watch, clean up after him.
SPEAKER_01: It was not a surprise. It was not a surprise, Artem.
SPEAKER_01: He thinks there were different reasons, long flight, acclimatization. Also, Alex had a child born sometime before that match, so he didn't sleep well. He thinks those things. And also, it's Alex's weak point.
SPEAKER_01: Floor press, shoulder press. Okay, one second, one second. He said Alex had a match before that? No, not a match. He had a child born. Oh, child. His child was born and he thinks that it was stressful and he couldn't prepare very good. And also it was Alex's weak point. Shoulder press is Alex's weak point.
SPEAKER_00: I have talked with Alex. Alex was very confident about his victory. He was saying that he's going to for sure win. This is when the private talk happened. It's my opinion. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. No, I understand. And what did you think about this Messi one? I think that's true.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I didn't expect, actually, Jerry to win so easily. But on the other hand, I didn't see much of Alex to say that he is really top three heavyweight. I was not sure about that. I think Alex still thinks that only Jerry and Levan can beat him.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure. We'll see him against Artem. I'm not sure that it will be an easy match for Alex. Okay, there's a super chat. DB Talk says, what does Ivan think about a match between himself and Frank Lamparelli at 115 kilos?
SPEAKER_01: Pure hook versus pure top roll. Who will win? You ever pull, Frank Lamparelli? Did we pull? I think we pulled left hand at WAF or maybe right hand also at WAF in 2014 under 110 kilograms. So you pulled in two different categories. You pulled against him.
SPEAKER_00: And also at 100, I think, we pulled. But I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Who won? I think I won. Yes, I supinated quickly. Oh, you put him in the hook. Okay. Yes, yes. And Artem, Jerry and Levan, do you think that, Artem, when you overpronate, when you pronate so much, you know, you are missing here. And then
SPEAKER_00: You pronate, but you are not controlling here. So when somebody is pronating and Jerry is putting the shoulder, just say that if Jerry catches Levan in this position, here is Levan. And the match started. Do you think it will be easy for Levan to finish? Or you think there is a problem?
SPEAKER_01: If that happens, if Jerry goes in there, breaks through the center, the projection of Levan, then it will be very difficult. Even if Levan, for example, pulls out the first rounds, being fresh, then in the future he will lose speed and will give this position to Jerry time after time. It will, roughly speaking, lie in his hand.
SPEAKER_01: Artyom thinks yes. He agrees that if such situation happens, Lebanon would have big problems and he would be the favorite.
SPEAKER_01: So, he thinks that Lewand has to win quickly. Yeah, I agree with that. He has to win the center position. Yeah. Yes, and reach quickly. In my opinion, that anyone who goes against Jerry...
SPEAKER_00: overpronate yes see you do this you like the guy is pushing there you need to with here downside you need to block there block and then beat the arm once you take the hand you are even helping him you just go like this and then he he just dive in here you know so you need to really block here like the way that Hermes pull supinate yeah yeah supinate yeah supinate and if somehow
SPEAKER_00: You know, you just go this way and then it can become a big problem. I think for anyone. You put in jerry, you overpronate, you pronate too much. You don't put pressure with the downside and then boom, you are on your brachioradialis. And then he is all on your body and your only brachioradialis here. And it is...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you get tired and then finish as well. So anyone needs to pull over his pronator. What do you think, Ivan? Maybe you have a different opinion. I agree. I will tell you something. I remember that Michael Todd recently pulled effectively against Camille's flop press. And he used his open thumb.
SPEAKER_01: uh so i thought that um it would be very difficult for michael to win uh camille this way i thought that uh he had uh many chances to uh take the center uh or to use for the press himself but i was surprised with his open yeah i was thinking that if carmen comes here i thought he would be a winner but we need to know that michael is
SPEAKER_00: Like good endurance here. He pulled against Jerry like six, seven minutes as far as I remember. And so his style is there, you know. And I think Kamil's left arm pressure is stronger than his right arm pressure. With left arm, I think he do more pressure. So I think that Artem, someone like Ivan, Ivan Matushenko, would be good match against Jerry because controls the pronator.
SPEAKER_00: You understand? Because he goes like this and then he won't hit here. See, when you are here, you have pronated, your tricep is working this way. Once you turn pronated, now your tricep is working losing position.
SPEAKER_00: So to turn here, it helps here. So no more tricep here. Once you turn here, just try to train tricep. You need to train this way if it is turned that way. If it is turned that way, it's a winning position. This way, losing position. So that is why I think that Ivan versus Geri Kadoret would be a good match.
SPEAKER_00: my opinion but maybe his even his hook would be stronger than you and he would maybe press yes yes yeah there may be a problem there so so arjun what chance jerry has against levan um
SPEAKER_01: So it's again 50-50.
SPEAKER_00: Morozov said that Jerry versus Levan is 50-50? Yes, yes. If Levan sleeps, it will be 100% Jerry, Artyom thinks. Yes, 100% Jerry. So if he sleeps, the goal, and then slow, and then finish here, and then over. Yes. That's good that some people really realize that Jerry can be very dangerous, yeah. And what else did he say? Sorry about it, I cut you.
SPEAKER_01: No, that's it. So he said again that Levan has to take the centre and to win quickly. Okay, I agree. And what do you think, Levan? I think that Levan would... I think Levan would not... Levan would win? Yes, confidently I think he will not sleep. He will be fast. He will take the centre and...
SPEAKER_01: And I do not see Jerry in defensive position like Hermes. I think Jerry doesn't have so strong biceps. Yes, the only way for Jerry to win is to make Levan sleep. But I think Levan will not sleep. He will...
SPEAKER_00: uh yes okay anyway so i think i think yes if he tries to pull like against uh devon in first round not to start explosively i i think that once i started but his wrist was just blocked by devon's back pressure yes i don't know
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so... Also he said he was not sure. He said something in an interview that was not only his wrist in an uncomfortable position, but all in all he was not... Confident? Yes, he didn't have enough confidence to start. Okay, yeah, he said that, yeah. He also said that, yeah, right, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Anyways guys, thank you very much for being part of the podcast and I wish you guys healthy preparation. You have a very tough match with Alex Kurdeca and you have a very tough match with Ali Canmurado.

He says it's like East versus West is Jurassic Park with all kind of different dinosaurs, you know, just all different kind of dangerous animals, you know.
