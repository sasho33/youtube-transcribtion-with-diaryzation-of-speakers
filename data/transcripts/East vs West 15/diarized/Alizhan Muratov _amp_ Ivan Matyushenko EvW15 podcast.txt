Paulo: hello paulo hello engen how are you good good good and you yeah i'm i'm very good everything is fine that's good that's good yeah that's good you should take this yeah yeah so i heard the good news about uh your collaboration and business partner
Paulo: do you think about rovers uh i think that uh it's not getting any better than than him uh for this purpose for sure he is probably one of the biggest uh business names in uh arm wrestling community uh i have you met a young person uh yes i did i did and uh i think his intelligence and uh
Engin Terzi: his way of thinking and presenting everything is at the highest level at the highest possible level yeah he is like how to say respectful humble and like one of the nicest guys like he and uh cody merit super nice guys yeah yeah and yeah so
Engin Terzi: let me share this we are two three minutes early so they are coming soon let me share on facebook yeah the guy is really good guy you know i met him some many years but we became friends only a few years ago i think somebody came ivan matushenko hello ivan hello
Ivan Matyushenko: How are you? Good, good, and you? Good, thank you. Is it okay, my picture? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. Good, thank you.
Engin Terzi: Do you think this match is as tough as Morozov's match? I have no idea. From one point of view, it may be more difficult.
Alizhan Muratov: Hello, everyone. How are you? Yes, that's good. Like this? Yes, that's good. Greetings to everyone. Hello.
Engin Terzi: You're going to hold the phone like this? Can you not put somewhere, Alizhan? Yeah, yeah. So, Alizhan, you
Paulo: Share the video. You were on scale. It showed you, like, 120 kilos. Was it real, or you are playing games with Ivan? Well, who counted him?
Alizhan Muratov: The last video, right? Yes. Well, I think I really raised it. I'm sorry, I think the question is about your own weight. Well, I specifically wanted to lose weight, but it didn't work out. How much is your weight? Quite a lot, yes. A lot of weight. Let's bring Paul down.
Paulo: he's joking so far he said yeah the last video uh he said i i really lifted lifted the weight uh but you're asking uh about his own weight right yes yeah alizhan what what is
Paulo: said that he did not wake himself yet he was in a sauna today and he did a very good summer session uh but he did not wake himself no that's not what i am asking he was on the scale and then he showed the scale he was showing like something 120. was it real or he was just playing with ivan's mind you know okay i will ask one more time uh
Paulo: He said that if we show that, that was real for sure. And he said, don't worry about at the actual event, I will be at 115 kilos.
Engin Terzi: No, it's not because I'm worried or something. I just would like to know, you know. Like, he's normally 100, 305 kilos. Whenever the scale shows 120, you become curious, you know. That's what it is, you know. Engin says, well, he says, I'm not worried. He says, usually you weigh 103, 105 kilos. When they showed 120, he says, well, that's a very serious difference.
Alizhan Muratov: Yes, of course, there is a serious difference. I practically did not train after Gasparini. And as we were designated by Armfight, in general, from the same day I began to train. And that's how it is now. Every day we have training, preparation for Armfight.
Paulo: okay yeah he said yeah for sure it's a very serious difference and he said i almost did not train after a gasparini match but uh the moment that uh our match was uh set and announced the same day he started his preparation and from uh that moment every day is a training and that's what it is
Engin Terzi: And you, Ivan, I see some videos that you put, and you are just in a little bit joking way, not enough for Ali Can, but 100-something kilos, you know. And how is your form? How to say? Well, no, I like it. Now I feel better than I felt when preparing for Morozov.
Ivan Matyushenko: Because almost every workout my elbow hurt in last preparation. But now it seems to be okay. It seems to be much better than it was. So I think that I will make a better form this time than it was with Maruza. I hope so.
Paulo: Ivan says that he likes the training. Engin asked how your training is going, how you feel. Ivan says that he likes everything, everything is fine. When he was preparing for Morozov last time, he said that his elbow was hurting and there were questions and problems. Now he says that there is no problem and he says that he will probably bring a better form than he brought to Morozov. Any comments, Alizhan?
Alizhan Muratov: Comments? Do you want to comment on something? Comment on something, you say? Well, you know, I'm focused on my training now. I don't spend much time on my own business, family business, I can say that I'm more focused on armfighting.
Alizhan Muratov: And even now, before the broadcast, I contacted Engin, asked him how long it would take, because I'm now following the regime, it turns out, it's already 9 o'clock at night, now it's 10, I have to go to bed to be productive in the morning, at work and in training,
Paulo: I concentrate on my training very much and he said I even before our podcast I contacted Engin to ask how long it's gonna take because I'm so much on point of my
Paulo: schedule it's like 10 o'clock it will be 10 o'clock at night there and i want to make sure that i go to bed on time so i wake up in the morning and being fully productive and can give my hundred percent during the training session and so on and so on so he's very concentrated on his preparation how do you see this match like what is your chance of winning how do you see you feel confident and you are thinking it will be very hard match
Paulo: Alizhan, how do you feel about this match? Are you confident? Or do you think this match will be very difficult? How do you see this match in general? You know, I always try to make it so that it is difficult here in the gym.
Alizhan Muratov: so that it would be at least easier during the fight. But every time our opponents become stronger and stronger, because the circle narrows, and when preparing, you need to make some progress accordingly. Because of this, I don't think it will be easier, but I think it will be a great fight.
Paulo: Because I think both of us are fighting for this. It will be a very powerful fight. Yes, Ivan? Olezhan is saying that every time it's getting better and better because our circle of opponents is getting smaller and opponents every time is better and stronger. And he said that he's preparing very, very serious. And he said that...
Engin Terzi: because of similarity in styles they both pulling inside it's really a great fight and very very serious fight very powerful also he is expecting a very tough match yes okay okay because a lot of people sees him as favorites i just think this is a very dangerous match for both ivan you look heavy my friends are you over 115 yes
Engin Terzi: yes that's what i guess 116 117 no 15 15 only 15 okay i'll try to add one or two kilograms more so i will be a little heavier than usual if everything goes well yeah yeah and how do you see the match
Ivan Matyushenko: difficult to say actually i work both on my strength and endurance and wrist also pronation so we'll see
Ivan Matyushenko: I'd like to win this match with one move, but quickly. But I'm not sure at all that I will have enough strength to do it. So, we'll see. Sorry, sorry. Engin asked Ivan the same question. How do you see this match? How will it go?
Paulo: Yeah, ready. Yeah.
Paulo: Paolo, how do you see this match? I'm not asking who's going to win or something, but where do you see the level of this match? This is the highest possible level. I think both guys are top three, top five in the world overall. But for 115, it is as hard as possible. That's it. It doesn't get any better. It doesn't get any better.
Paulo: there is nobody even close there is nobody even close to them maybe Petrenko somewhere in the same same pound but uh it was not it was not there yet so I really really think it's uh the toughest match we will see for past couple events for them do you see this as a historical match it is it is it is it is we're making history here definitely
Paulo: I want to see Petrenko to pull somewhere. Maybe whoever is going to take a loss will probably make sense to me to face Petrenko. Either it's a rematch with Adizano or maybe a new match with Ivan. I think he's somewhere in the pool, especially his level is growing back. And I think he's the only contender in that pool. There is nobody else close to them.
Engin Terzi: Alizhan, you have been competing at the East vs. West. So far, is this your toughest match on the paper? Alizhan, you have already performed a lot at the East vs. West. Do you think this is your most difficult match or not?
Alizhan Muratov: Absolutely, yes, because we are now going to fight for the title. For the title in the 115 category. 115, and Ivan, it seems to me, is not just sitting in the first place. Because of this, there will definitely be difficulties. Not like the passing fights. So you need to approach this very seriously.
Paulo: Alizhan is saying that absolutely yes. This is a title match and there is a reason why Ivan is sitting on the very top of this class. And he said most likely there will be some complications and he is taking this match very, very serious. And Ivan, who do you think is faster? You or...
Ivan Matyushenko: Alizhan. I think that wrist move, wrist call is better. But maybe the body move. The whole move. Maybe Alizhan's was more powerful. I hope so.
Paulo: Yeah, that's exactly my opinion, but can you translate and ask him the same question, please, Paolo? Yes. Alizhan, Engin asked Ivan, who do you think is faster? And Ivan says that the movement of the wrist itself is probably faster for me, that is, for Ivan, but the general movement of the hand and body is probably faster for Alizhan, but I have also finished it and I hope I have finished it.
Alizhan Muratov: And Engin asks you the same question. How do you think, who is faster? I can't give an assessment, because the start is developed relative to the opponent, I think. Well, my personal opinion. The start, especially for each opponent, it does not play.
Alizhan Muratov: It's almost impossible to win every opponent from the start. I don't think any of us will win from the start. I think there will be a tough fight and that's it. Do you think that after the start you will slow down somewhere in the middle of the table? Of course. Okay. Yeah, Alizhan is saying that, you know, in my personal opinion, that speed
Paulo: is uh very particular to your opponent and in this particular case he thinks that they are not uh faster of each other they approximately at the same at the same speed and he really believes that it's gonna be a fight and they and i re-ask one more time just to make sure he thinks that they're gonna at the initial ready go stop in the middle somewhere in the middle of the table
Engin Terzi: Hmm, yeah, I can't wait. I can't wait. Today, today, I was just like, my graphic designer, Sol Arun said that, like, he's gonna make an event list poster. And he told me, can you give me the match order? And whenever I was writing the matches, like I was like, wow, you know, just trust me, really, like, like, incredible that that, like,
Paulo: like i will just sit there and watch it like from the best possible place as always you know it's incredible yeah uh yeah i i i if you don't mind my five steps yeah i will i believe i i maybe i'm wrong because this preparation was a little different for both guys but i've been following both and i love love both athletes so i i have an opinion i think that ivan may uh may be
Paulo: a little bit of the start and gain a small angle to alijan's side but alijan's explosiveness overall may may stop that match in a little different angle and may bring it back to the middle of the table that's my opinion i i think that uh it was hand and wrist domination yes over the tornado he just isolate here you know just like you cannot have tornado if you are pulling
Engin Terzi: against matushenko unless your name is vitality or something you know you understand right yeah he will isolate there whenever he isolates there like when your tornado isolates your grip also gets really bit loose because the guy is putting here so much pressure and you
Engin Terzi: I feel the same. I feel that the E1 will be the faster one, you know, because I think Ali Can is fast like this way with whole body. But to do this move, you need to protect your pronator. If your pronator gets isolated, your body will go this way, but your forearm stays. So I don't know about like 100%.
Engin Terzi: I kind of think that everyone will be faster, but I think the match is going to stop somewhere for sure. I just do not know how low. If it is like near the middle, I think the match will come to the center. But if it is too low, then it may never come to there. It's just opening we are. This is incredible, yeah. Olezhan, I just put in my five kopecks and commented on it.
Paulo: I watch you both closely, because I like both of you, how you fight. And I also fight with my left hand sometimes. It interests me. That's why I commented. I think Ivan can move his wrist a little faster. Therefore, it is possible that after the start he will hit you a little bit from the center. But due to the fact that you have explosive power,
Paulo: Maybe a little more, maybe you'll go back to the center of the table, but then it's unknown, we all want to see. Engel also commented, but about the same way, he also thinks that it is possible that because Ivan twists his wrist faster, very quickly, it is possible that he will knock out some corner right after the start.
Engin Terzi: But everyone wants to see it. Everyone is looking forward to it. Alizhan, after having Hermes as an opponent, he was too confident. And now your opponent is very humble, he doesn't say any provocative words. How do you feel?
Engin Terzi: Even you look more provocative. You are not that challenging guy either, but even you look more provocative than Ivan. You made a video that you were beating Ivan or something like that. He's here, right? Ivan? Yes, yes. He's here, right? I would never expect this from him. But I think after Hermes, he gets the disease, you know?
Paulo: Olezhan, Engin says that after you fought with Hermes, Hermes is such a provocateur, he provoked you and said that he was so confident that he would win and so on. How do you feel now that Ivan does not provoke you at all? Such a very modest, calm guy, very confident, but calm. Now it turns out that even you are more provocative than Ivan.
Alizhan Muratov: You posted a video. How will you win? How do you feel in this situation? I think there will be no aggression, only sports interest. It seems to me that everything will be resolved peacefully.
Paulo: uh yeah he's saying no i believe that we are not uh aggressive in that in that direction he said that there is only sportsmanship and sportsman interest and he said that it's going to be very peaceful very peaceful match yeah but not at the table it will be as aggressive as possible ivan like i have known you for like almost 20 years
Engin Terzi: yet i don't remember even one time you scream at the table i don't remember maybe you did it but i i did not witness will we ever see you at the table ready go like this will we ever see you you think until you retire if you give a special bonus i'll go to drama school
Paulo: I will go. If you give a special course, I will go. Oh, you will go to learn, to go to school, yes. Okay, okay. Yeah, okay. I think... Alizhan, Alizhan, Engin asked, Ivan says, he says, well, I've known you for 20 years, he says, have you ever, at the table, after the radio, you know, at least some, some sound,
Engin Terzi: I see these guys like, how do you say, silence before the storm. These guys look very calm, very respectful, but everything is inside. When the match comes,
Engin Terzi: All that power comes out, yeah. And Lozo is asking, Engin, can you find a match for Ricard Bornemann? He might be number one in Australia already at 20 years old. You are the best matchmaker for him. Yeah, he is for sure under the radar. For sure, you know. Yeah, for sure he should be invited. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, so let's ask them...
Engin Terzi: This one and then let's go for the predictions. Next year, their first left-arm match will be against each other. Morozov and Laletin. Ali Can, who is winning? Laletin or Morozov? I know you are from Kazakhstan and you will not be objective.
Alizhan Muratov: He says, I know you're from Kazakhstan, but I still have to ask you about Laletin and Morozov. It's hard, to be honest. It's very hard, but... Up to the top, it seems to me that it's Laletin, most likely. If Morozov manages to... They still have Kruk on their right hand, right?
Alizhan Muratov: No, they will be on the left. On the left? Yes. Next year, the first night. It's very difficult, you know. I think Lolita will win. I think so.
Engin Terzi: Ali Can is saying that it's very, very difficult and top-roll over top-roll. Laletin, if Morozov will be able somehow to sink him in a hook, maybe. But he said, I think that Laletin is going to win. This is a fair word. And I think Morozov, you think, Ivan, you think the same way? I think it will be very difficult for Artyom. And this one I want to ask Ali Can. How do you see your chances against Laletin?
Alizhan Muratov: Alizhan asks you, how do you see your chances against Valitin? My chances? Yes. There are always chances. When there is already an agreement, then you need to work on it.
Alizhan Muratov: I always say that human capabilities are unlimited, so there is nothing impossible if a person, well, for example, if I am tuned in to something, well, let's say an armfighter is tuned in and that's it, I think it will be possible to
Paulo: I think that there is always a chance. And he said that if there will be a serious conversation and that super match will be set, he will get ready for it.
Engin Terzi: And he said that there is not really a limit to the human's body. And he said that everything is, yes, everything is possible. Possible. Okay. Okay. I understand. And I didn't ask this to Ivan because I... I will ask about the matches.
Engin Terzi: match order and okay let's start and i want you to also tell your opinion uh paulo brigitta versus gladkaya brigitta glotka unfortunately i do not know brigitta so from hungary from hungary
Alizhan Muratov: You don't remember? I saw her on the poster, but I didn't see her pulling. And what did Alizhan say? Alizhan? To be honest, you know, I don't follow these athletes, I don't want to lie, I can't even comment on this.
Paulo: Ali Can cannot comment it because he said, I don't know. I don't want to lie. I know both of them. They did not pull on a very serious level much lately, especially Irina. But if she will be in that form that she can, I believe she has an edge. That's my belief. And Ali Can, Azat versus Danil Ustinov.
Engin Terzi: Who's winning? Danil is the winner? Danil is the winner. And Ivan? Sorry, I have no idea. Oh, you don't know Azat, the current world champion, 70 kilos, from Armenia?
Engin Terzi: and versus current 75 kilo world champion Danil Ustinov? I think I saw Ustinov, but I cannot estimate their power. Okay. Sorry. I cannot predict this one either. I know both athletes, but I cannot predict it. They both go outside and they are very strong, yeah.
Engin Terzi: I saw only a few matches, but I cannot predict. What did you guys think about the news match, Ivan, that I just shared today? Really interesting, yes. Ozan Koçak versus Nugo Chikadze. Yes. It may be a really exciting match. Both efforts are powerful.
Ivan Matyushenko: I only think about Oguzhan's wrist. Will he be able to force Nugzari into hook? If he forces, it would be really interesting. And I think he will manage to do it. Maybe not in the past rounds, but in later rounds, I think he will have chances. Do you think that he doesn't have a chance to go outside?
Alizhan Muratov: Or sideways? Actually, I know him, his hoop. I saw how good he is. But I didn't see him... Okay. And Ali Can. Nugo versus Oguzhan. Nugo versus Oguzhan. You know what? Nugo... Koçak? Koçak, yeah. Koçak, yeah.
Alizhan Muratov: Well, the only thing I know about Kuchak is that he has a very... Right hand, yes? Yes, right hand, yeah. Very strong Kuchak. Hook. He has a very strong hook, I remember. But I don't know the opponent, so... Kuchak... Most likely... I'll bet on Kuchak.
Paulo: He thinks that Kuchak is going to win. He doesn't really know his opponent, but he knows that Kuchak's hook is super strong, but that's why he thinks that Kuchak is going to win. And do you know these athletes both? I'm sure you know Nugo, but do you know Ozan? Yeah, I know. I know. I think that Nugo is going to win. I think his abilities of setting hook is, you know, will bring him to the win. Nugo is a top roller.
Engin Terzi: Okay, Artur Makarov versus Ömer Kozakoğlu. Alechan, did you follow? Artur versus who? I'm sorry. Ömer Kozakoğlu, current 80kg world champion. He won against Aydar Khan with fouls. But he's very, very... If the guy... I mean, the reason Aydar Khan was successful
Engin Terzi: He was, Aydar Khan is incredibly explosive, super explosive. And, but not sure if Artur has the same hand wrist and explosiveness. Do you, do you have an idea about this one? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, uh, root for Makarov, but, um, I, um,
Ivan Matyushenko: Cannot. Did you see Ömer's hand build and everything? They call, yes, like Makarov maybe. Maybe not Makarov, but it looks more like Zogs. Yeah. So there will be two guys with not normal hands. Yeah. With enormous, enormous hands. Not normal, but enormous.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And Alizhan, any idea? Alizhan, do you know Makarov and... I'm sorry. Ömer Kozakoğlu. Ömer Kozakoğlu. Yeah. Big arms, yes? Yes, yes, big arms. Same as Zouk, same as Makarov, yeah. I don't know.
Alizhan Muratov: Yeah, yeah. He won on fouls, but, you know. Yeah. Yeah.
Alizhan Muratov: I think he wasn't in good shape lately, but it will be an interesting fight, so 50-50. 50-50. And you have any idea, because Ömer is a very young guy, have you seen his photos and everything? Yes.
Paulo: I don't know. I think it's going to be interesting because of the anthropometry, but I think Makarov is very upscale. As Alizhan mentioned, he lost to Cherkastov, but I think he was not in the best shape at the moment. But his training, in my opinion, he may bring a better form and he may be a slight favorite. Okay. And Carolina Pettersson?
Ivan Matyushenko: Dimitrina Petrova, Ivan. Great match. Looking forward to it. I think that Dimitrina is maybe a favorite, a little favorite, but I think it will be a great match anyway.
Alizhan Muratov: But you don't have any opinion? Dimitrina, you said? Yes, I think she has a little more chances. And Alizhan? Dimitrina and Carolina Pettersson. Carolina Pettersson from Sweden. Both are strong girls. They have been performing for a long time. So 50-50.
Paulo: I think Dimitrina has a little power advantage on it, but if Carolina will stop a match for a little longer than one second, then her chances will escalate a lot. I still believe that Dimitrina has a little edge, but there is a very good chance that Carolina will tire her up and tie her in a match.
Ivan Matyushenko: and then then it's gonna switch okay ivan oleg zog versus betty leone that this time it will be more difficult for oleg to win as uh i was impressed by betty last time yes and i think that uh now it may go both ways
Ivan Matyushenko: Actually, last time Betkili won one round. Was it two years ago? Did he win one round? Betkili won once, one round against Oleg. No, I don't remember. I mean, it was a very long match, but I couldn't remember. Maybe by fouls or something, or he pinned him.
Engin Terzi: It doesn't matter, it was a long match and Oleg won at the end. Now I think it will be a 50-50 match. 50-50, so Oleg can still win? Yes. And Ali Can? Oleg vs. Betkili. I think you did final with Betkili, right? No. Oleg Zhokh vs. Betkili Oniani.
Alizhan Muratov: 95 kilos? Yeah, 95, 95, yeah. 95? Yeah, 95. Well, if it's 95 kilos, Yanni should be in good shape. Zhokh, I don't think he's underweight, is he? Well, I think, yeah, he's usually 80, somewhere around 80, up to 85 he is. Uh-huh.
Alizhan Muratov: If you are able to go in and break Jokhu's wrist, then it's a clear victory for Oniani. If you can't do it, you lose. 50-50. 50-50.
Paulo: yeah so so i don't think that uh you know if if any any will uh in in a strap if any any will be able to beat his wrist somehow then a hundred percent win uh but otherwise it's uh in his opinion it's 50 50. in my personal opinion there is uh there is no need for any any to be joe's uh wrist it's probably not really possible
Paulo: There is other ways around, which is probably Agnani is getting ready for. And I think that his chances definitely better than the last time, especially in 95 kilos. Yes, Jacques' arm is super, super unorthodox. But Agnani was a big surprise for me last time. And I believe this time with all the preps and knowing the situation and how to pull him,
Engin Terzi: he has a better chance and he has a slight edge on Zhokh. Because I don't think that Zhokh will bring a much better form than the last time. I think he will be because that was Oleg's returning match after his accident. Right now it has been more than two and a half years. It was 2022 February and now November 2024. Two and a half years. Yeah, and listen.
Engin Terzi: He was coming back from the accident, injury, you know. So we will see, we will see. But yeah, I shouldn't say my opinion, but like, as you said, slightly, Betkili looks, because this is a different category. Before he was 90 kilos, as far as I remember. And this is now 95, and I don't think Oleg will be even 90 kilos.
Engin Terzi: I don't think so. He's usually between 80 and 85. Have you ever pulled Yoshinobu, Ivan? I saw his matches against Farid, against Michael Todd, against
Ivan Matyushenko: I don't remember who else. He was extremely strong in those years, but it was very long ago. And now he seems to be smaller. It is 95 kilograms. Or 105, 105. 105 kilos, yeah. I think he was bigger than he used to be. He was bigger in those years. He was 110 maybe. He looked bigger, I think.
Ivan Matyushenko: Stylistically, as far as I remember, Todd Hutchings is comfortable for him. His top roll is good against hook pullers. I don't think Kanai is going to go hook. I think Kanai can go this way, this way, this way. I said he is good against hook pullers.
Engin Terzi: Oh, but we don't know if Todd is going to go. Yes, but yes, on the other hand, I just want to say that Todd doesn't go, doesn't hook lately. He also can go. He couldn't go against Dadikian outside, so he had to hook, and he hooked Dadikian, but then he lost. But yeah, the only thing is that both these guys...
Engin Terzi: You have seen the matches of the Kanai. Once he has the pronator, even his hand is lost, he can hold here like forever. And a lot of people try to beat him with the shoulder pressure, which Todd doesn't have. But Todd is the same exact way. As long as he has a little bit pronator, he can also pull like crazy.
Engin Terzi: I give the edge to Todd because he is the one who is proven while Kanai is a question mark. But there is a potential that we may see something crazy if that match somehow stops because Kanai also has incredible endurance. And who do you think is going to win, Ivan? I would bet on Todd.
Ivan Matyushenko: Only because Kane was inactive all these years. Yeah. But if somehow he can come with that level, then you think that there may be some more? If he brings his best level, I would even bet on him. Wow. But I think he cannot do this under 105%.
Alizhan Muratov: I think he will be back. Okay. And Alizhan, do you know Kanai? Kanai, Japan? Japan, yeah. Kanai versus Todd Hutchings. Who is it? Todd Hutchings. Todd Hutchings.
Paulo: Who did Kanai win? He hasn't fought for a long time. He used to win and fought well with Michael Todd, with Rosenko, with Ranbet. But he hasn't fought for a long time. Todd Hutchings.
Engin Terzi: same question here he's like and i did not wasn't active for a long time is that correct i'm like yes he was in fact through his friend offered me to pull devon and i told to his friend i said you are just making a comeback like would you prefer another opponent and he said no i will wait i said devon is pulling petrenko he said he will wait and then i said
Paulo: How about Tad Hashing? And he was like, okay, you know? So, and what is your opinion? I think Tad Hashing is going to win only because Kanai was not active on a big stage. And, you know, if you put a shark in a small aquarium, you know, it will not grow. I understand Kanai was already in a big ocean, but inactivity, not...
Paulo: uh giving him opportunity to be on the same level so uh comeback match with todd hudson is i don't know if it's not a good idea it's just we we don't know what uh shape can i is in right now so i would like to see first match a little lower scale if that would be possible to see the shape and very possible that he's in a great shape you know we we don't we just he's in great shape
Engin Terzi: I'm not going to go into details using great shape, but I don't know compared to his best, how great. Yeah, so that's my opinion. Tad Hutchings will win this match. Let's go a little bit faster because we have 13 minutes. You and Alizhan have only one hour. And let's go. Ibragim Sagov versus Rino. Ivan. It might be a really close match. 50-50. I think...
Ivan Matyushenko: Ibragim has a little stronger triceps, shoulder power. But Rino has better defensive hook. And as we saw Ibragim pull in... Well, I think that Rino can pose problems to Ibragim. But I think it is an equal match, close match.
Engin Terzi: you say you think 50 50 match yes yes and i think it will not be easy it will not be so they will be both of them yes you know irino seems like he's someone very good offensive but when he pulled against basho and when he stopped him here he also proved that he has very good defense yeah that's what makes me think that it will be going to be a long time and alijan reno versus
Engin Terzi: Ibragim Sako probably a little bit more powerful. I believe he has a little small edge, but I want to see the match because Rino
Paulo: is always impressive always against everybody so i want to see the match but uh i believe that ibrahim has a little bit of the edge okay samusha versus myro alijan samusha mayors
Alizhan Muratov: Is Samushia a favorite? Well, if he wants to take revenge, then we believe in Maiorov. I still think that due to the fact that Samushia won last time, I think 50-50 can be given, if they have a revenge.
Paulo: Alizhan saying that you know what if Maiorov is asking for revenge for rematch that means that he is ready and he gets much better and he believes that he can win it and that's very respectful but because Samushia won the last time he's supposed to be a favorite in this time so he says I will believe that Maiorov have a better edge but I would say it's 50-50 match it's unpredictable
Ivan Matyushenko: And Ivan? About the same. I see Maiorov as a little favorite just because Maiorov says that he's now much better prepared, that he trained longer. But all in all, it's also an equal match.
Engin Terzi: Every time I hear your opinions, every time I hear, I say, okay, I said very good event, you know, because I think it's the greatest. So yes, I agree 100%. This is the best card I ever said, you know, like I have personally, I have no doubts, you know, this is the best card ever, my opinion. And how do you see this match, Paolo?
Paulo: Engin, yes, you're doing a very good job because most of the matches are unpredictable and nobody can answer straight, yeah, you know what, it's not interesting, you're going to win. No, this doesn't exist that way. So I want to believe that Maiorov may pull a win this time and I would give him a slight edge because last time he was really, I've been translating the podcast, so I remember very well what he's been saying. It was not really enough time. Only two months, he trained two months, yeah.
Paulo: Yes, it was not really enough time for anybody, plus his specific style needs, in my opinion, more training and more recovery time, especially for an athlete like him.
Paulo: And I believe this time he knows what he's talking about. And I would give him a slight edge. They're very close. Devon't get me wrong. Samushia will be ready for this one because he knows what he's dealing with. He will take his notes too. But I believe that Maiorov may win. And I would give him a couple percent of the edge on this. To be honest, I want to see. That's interesting that nine times,
Engin Terzi: The guy defending his title and he's underdog against someone that he beat before. I know it doesn't work that way, but it is on the paper. It looks very interesting. Yeah. Very interesting. Very interesting. Okay. What an event, my friend. Just look at the matches. Laletin versus Di Dzeranov. Alizhan, you start. Laletin, Di Dzeranov. Di Dzeranov versus Laletin. It's the right one. The right one?
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Alizhan Muratov: such a know before 1 year we fought for Ivan in the fifteenth year I remember everything then not then for Ivan he said that he was convenient for him that he was convenient for him, well, then I remember it was already 9 years ago after that, it seems to me that they did not meet or maybe they met in the sixteenth year, but
Alizhan Muratov: The last moments, Goga Dzeranov won it. I think Bulgaria has been to the World Championships several times. He won, so they are rivals in life. So Engin put these rivals very well. It will be very interesting to see.
Alizhan Muratov: If Dzeranov tries, he will win, respectively, and Laletin, if he tries, he will win. So, in any case, 50-50, it seems to me. Alizhan was commenting this, because they were... Well, in any case, for the authentic Nikopolin, of course, but in my understanding, approximately, I think, on equal terms, very...
Paulo: It's an interesting fight. Alizhan is commenting and he has a whole history in his head. And he remembers that in 2015 and 2016 they were pulling at the same events and Dzeranov was winning and Laletin. They were back and forth. Dzeranov commented that Laletin for him is a very comfortable opponent. Comfortable? Comfortable, yes.
Paulo: He said that Engin did a very good job setting up this match. It's a very interesting match. He said that I'm cheering for Dzeranov, but in reality, it very much depends on which form will bring each athlete. If Vitalii brings his best form, he has a better chance. If Dzeranov brings his best form, Dzeranov has a better chance. So he said, I want to see the match definitely.
Paulo: because of the history of those two athletes and because of i want to see how they they are you know how they prepared yeah yeah okay so he says that both has chance to win whoever did the better homework will win yes okay ivan i think that vitalik has more chances some some more chances yes uh very interesting match uh just because
Ivan Matyushenko: uh knows how to uh win against vitale but i'm not sure that he is uh this technique i think that lately he was better in cook so i'm not sure about his top role but anyway very exciting match and you
Paulo: Guys, we have four minutes, but we need to finish four more matches. I love the match. I think Vitalii still has an edge, but Dzeranov's inside and side game is on point. So Vitalii has to be very careful what he's doing. He needs to finish the match. There is this much from losing the match for Vitalii. So super close. Vitalii slightly favourites.
Ivan Matyushenko: Okay, okay. Irakli Zirakashvili or Georgii Tautiev, Ivan? A little more chances for Tautiev. For Tautiev, wow. I think that his wrist is a little stronger than Irakli's wrist and it will be a decisive factor. Yeah, I just did an interview with Irakli and Irakli asked me, he said,
Engin Terzi: What does Tautiev do with the world title match? He says that he doesn't even deserve to be there. And now you are saying that he's the favorite and you are smiling. Yeah, I love that. Yeah. I really think that he's not comfortable for Irakli. Yeah. And yeah.
Alizhan Muratov: And what do you think, Ali-Chan, Irakli versus Tautiev, Georgii Tautiev versus Irakli Zirakashvili? According to the strength indicators, Irakli Zirakashvili is very strong. We all observe him according to strength indicators. But according to anthropometric indicators, Tautiev...
Alizhan Muratov: Yes, his hands are long, his fingers are long, so on the table, too, you have to give them the right ones. On the strength of Zira Korshvili, on the technique of Tautiev. So, guys, it's also an interesting fight that I would like to see.
Alizhan Muratov: So I can't give it to either of them. So it's 50-50.
Paulo: I just want to say that it's very interesting to follow both athletes and especially Irakli because he likes Irakli's power and lifting weights. He's a very strong athlete. But on the other hand, Tautiev's anthropometry is much better. And technique-wise, he believes that Tautiev is better. So he said we cannot cross that out. And he said that he wants to see this match. He will give them both the same credit.
Paulo: and he wants to see the match. So he says that Tautiev is a worthy opponent for the title? Yes, yes. I believe that Irakli will win this match with not too much of the edge to him but because of the power and I
Paulo: I like power myself, and I believe that he will overpower him. But he has to be careful, absolutely, yes. I agree with the anthropometry and how complications of the opponent, yes, it's right there. It's the same level, absolutely. So he may dominate him, or it may become a war. If he just blows and he just blows back, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, only two matches left. Michael Todd versus Genadi Kvikvinia.
Ivan Matyushenko: Ivan? Also looking forward to this match. 50-50. I don't know how good is Genadi now. I know that Michael is very good, very strong. So, we'll see. I would say 50-50. And John? Michael told the Queen, yeah.
Engin Terzi: michael todd king's move yeah the the shoulder is here this foul this okay this is okay this is foul very interesting
Alizhan Muratov: so according to the rules from the west if he manages to keep him maybe he will beat the queen also very so to speak you don't know how this fight will turn out, you can only give a rating of 50 to 50 in general, you can say that
Alizhan Muratov: The fights, all the arm fights, are very unpredictable. It's hard to say that exactly... Yes, there were some arm fights in the past that you could say, well, this one will win, this one will win, let's say, but here there are already some difficulties in the forecasts. So, I can no longer say that
Paulo: Yeah, Alizhan commented that if Michael Todd will be able and most likely he will be able to force his
Paulo: Kings move, which is actually an open top roll, let's say, with an East versus West rule, then he will probably pump Kvikvinia, and he has a good chance of winning this match. And he said, Engin, I cannot predict any of these matches.
Paulo: that somebody will win before cards before this card the previous cards it was some of the matches was predictable this card he said listen every match you asking me I have to stay 50 50 because they're unpredictable you know what uh I would probably predict this match uh favoring Michael Todd
Paulo: I don't think it's going to be 3-0. I know Michael Todd's shape right now. Devon't get me wrong. I'm not crossing out Bikini. They are super close, and I want to see the match definitely, but I would favor Michael Todd. Knowing how much heart and work he put in this preparation over the last year and a half, and knowing his condition, his lift,
Engin Terzi: And his, you know, obviously style, I would give him a slight advantage on this. Let's go to the last match. Petrenko versus Devon. Devon may lose. Devon may lose? Maybe. That was a draw, yes.
Alizhan Muratov: Ivan. You start, you start, you start, Oleg. What do you think? Oleg, tell me, what do you think? Petrenko is very strange. Petrenko, it seems to me, has scored very well lately. Maybe he will make a sensation. So I, perhaps, believe in Petrenko. Let it be a great fight for now.
Paulo: I don't think that Petrenko gained a lot lately and he said that very possible that he will do a sensation and he believes that it's very possible and he said I put my money on Petrenko this time. He says that Petrenko is going to win. Yes. And Ivan? I think that Petrenko has some more chances to
Ivan Matyushenko: Only Devon's open arm in the first round, open arm top row can help him. Because I think that Devon cannot be really strong under 105. I think his good weight is over 110. So you are saying that it's a close match or what do you say? Yes, it may be. If Devon...
Ivan Matyushenko: will not be able to use his open arm in the first round. And I think it may be that Petrenko can win quite easily. But if Devon manages to do something like he did against Prudnik in the first round, then everything is possible.
Engin Terzi: But I think that all in all, under 105, Petrenko would be a stronger one. Devon would have more endurance, but strength... So you are saying that the match needs to stop somewhere, and then Devon can win. But there is a possibility that the match may not stop, is what you are saying? Yes, it is also possible under 105, yes. Okay. And you? And again, six rounds, right?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, you need to win four rounds, yeah. For three, Devon. First three, Petrenko will win. Then Devon will win. I'm right now surprised. I was expecting you guys to say that Devon is clear favorite. These two said that Petrenko is likely favorite. And you are saying that Devon is going to win, but barely. That's what you are saying. Barely, barely. On the end of it, maybe not barely, but first three matches he will lose.
Engin Terzi: Okay, but this is 4-3 is barely, you know, anyways. Okay, the last question. The last question. From 0 to 100, how would you rate the event? The level of the event, the quality of the matches, how would you rate, Alizhan? Can you ask Alizhan, Pablo? Yes, I'm sorry. I'm thinking about rate.
Paulo: Olezhan, in percentage from 0 to 100, how would you rate the upcoming map made by Engin? What is the maximum percentage between 0 and 100? Than before? No, in general, for example, 100 is perfect, everything can not be better, and 0 is very bad. And where is this map?
Alizhan Muratov: You know, the last event from the WES-12 version, which took place, before that I held, how many, three ARM fights, in general, I had about 4 or 5 ARM fights, and every time, the last time, this level, aura, this
Alizhan Muratov: It was the fans who surprised me. World fans who are not worse than football fans. I really liked it. I realized that we are going in the direction of great development of our sport. And now I believe that it will be even better
Alizhan Muratov: last time, so now the cards are very interesting now, I've already talked about it before, the most interesting thing is to see some fights, so not only for me, I think it's interesting for the whole world, it seems to me that no one can say one hundred percent that these or other athletes can win and
Alizhan Muratov: These are interesting arm fights. I can give 100% of my answer to Engin. Engin, yeah, Alizhan commented pretty long and he said that
Paulo: every time it's better and better and uh we're like uh uh football uh fans right now sitting the whole world sitting by the tvs and waiting for this event and blah blah blah and uh it's it's it's unpredictable matches and he said that without any shame i can say that this is a hundred percent and e1 agree agree
Paulo: Yeah, this I love, this I love. We all together do this and I love it. We will just pull and wash. And you, Paolo, is it good? Well, it's very good. It's awesome. It's probably the best up to date. I would not give you 100%. You know why? Because it will not leave you any room to improve.
Engin Terzi: Okay. Next time we give you 102. Yeah, no, that doesn't exist, right? So I will give you a little less than 100. So each next card you will create even better than this. Yeah. At that time, we bring this one to 97, we make the next one 100. Yes, exactly. Anyways, guys, I know I took 10 minutes from you, but we just had to finish the last matches. Paolo, thank you very, very much, my friend, as always.
Engin Terzi: Like you, not only as a translator, but also as an expert, you help a lot. Thank you very much, my friend.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, thank you. Ivan and Ali Can, thank you very much. You guys, it doesn't matter who wins. You both are incredible. And I'm a fan of you guys. And I will be just at the front. I will take the advantage of being an organizer and we'll watch it very closely. I wish you guys the best health. I hope no injury. And let the better one win. But there is no shame because losing against Ali Can is no shame. Losing against Matyushenko is no shame.
Paulo: So you both are champions for me. Thank you, guys. Thank you, Engin. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Alizhan. Engin said he wishes you all the best, that you win better. He says, I will take advantage of your position as an organizer and watch you from a very close distance. And he says, it's not a shame to lose to one or the other opponent, because you are both at the highest level, and he is your fan and fan.
Alizhan Muratov: Thank you, Engin. Thank you. Thank you very, very much.
