Irina Gladkaya: joining us two superstars world champions that will compete at east versus west 15. the east versus west sorry we can't hear you correctly there's something wrong with the
Irina Gladkaya: now it's good now it's good okay it's good good i'm gonna check if uh on the live chat hi everyone if you have questions uh i'm gonna try to do two things at once i'm not very good at it but and i'm sitting here at my job so if you see people walking around it's um it's from my work yeah so when will you finish
Irina Gladkaya: I will work one hour with you. It's okay. I won't get paid for this at work. If somebody at work is watching. Yeah. So you girls will have a world title match. Right arm minus 70 kilos. Right? Right arm minus 70 kilos.
Irina Gladkaya: So Irina, what do you weigh right now? 68 right now. 68? Are you going to eat 270? She will not do it specifically. She just eats what she wants to eat.
Irina Gladkaya: That's interesting. That's good. Not needing to lose weight. What is her weight again, please? Exactly? 68. Okay, thank you. And how about you, Brigitta? 69.5. 69.5. Yeah, so about 70. Yeah, that's perfect. So you can also eat.
Brigitta Ivánfi: Of course. So this is the first time that you are both competing at the East versus West. How do you feel, Brigitta, about that? For her it's a very big thing and it's probably one of the biggest goals for her to achieve.
Brigitta Ivánfi: It was one of her biggest dreams. Yeah, she's saying that everyone wants to be there at East vs West, competing against one of the highest level of leads, and she now can be a part of it. So yeah, she's very happy about it. And ready? Yes.
Irina Gladkaya: First of all, you were asked what it means for you to participate in East-West. As far as I understand, this is the first time you will fight there. And Brigitta just told me that it is important for her.
Translator: And now Marina is asking why. She remembers that the fight was already possible, but it didn't work out. I wonder why, apparently. I understand.
Irina Gladkaya: Well, everyone understands that it's my first time participating in the West-West. This is probably the only competition where I would like to compete. And finally I had such a chance. Why have I yet abandoned the fight with Fia Raze? Because I had a very short preparation period. I was offered literally two months ago. This is a short time for a title fight. Therefore, I told Engin,
Translator: She said that Engin offered her this match with FIA only two, maybe a little, months ago. And she needs more time to prepare for it. So she wants to start with
Brigitta Ivánfi: Another armfight before that. And how did you feel about being asked about Brigitta? Sorry, guys, our internet connection is a little bit unstable. That's what my laptop says. So we're going to switch to data. Just give me a second, okay? Please. Yes. And now Marina is asking, how did you feel about the offer to fight Brigitta?
Irina Gladkaya: To be honest, I took him seriously, because we've never fought with Brigitta. It's a new piece for me that I want to try. We fought in different categories, plus I know for sure that she is very strong, so it's interesting for me to assess my form and my preparation. It will be a fight, not just a warm-up fight, but to understand what form I am in today.
Translator: So she said that she took Brigitta seriously when Engin offered her this match. She is really interested to pull her. She never pulled her before and that's a question for her. How it will go and also she'd like to check her level at professional stage.
Irina Gladkaya: Yeah, because we haven't seen Irina for a while on the big stages for a couple of years. Has she still been training those years that we haven't seen her on the World Championships and other international competitions? I haven't seen you in a fight for a long time. Actually, the question is, have you been training all this time? What have you been doing in recent years? Although I think you've been fighting a little bit.
Translator: We just didn't take part for obvious reasons.
Irina Gladkaya: Yes, as you can see, we didn't have international competitions, the last international competitions were in 2021, so we didn't fight for three years at international competitions. Well, of course, I kept my physical form, pretty good, good. It's a bit difficult for me to evaluate it on the international arena today, to be honest. I say now it will be indicative, but in any case, I'm not a gift.
Translator: She says that last time she pulled 2021 and after that there were no international tournaments for Russia. And now it's difficult for her to estimate her level, international level. But she says that for sure she will not be a present. Yeah. So, Brigitta, do you guys hear us now?
Irina Gladkaya: Yeah, we can hear you all, yeah. Navid, everything's fine, yeah, thank you. Perfect. So when you, Brigitta, heard that you were going to compete against Irina, have you ever competed against her before? No, we've never met before. Never, ever.
Brigitta Ivánfi: The competitions, yeah, they met with each other, but competitions, no, at the table. They were not in the same category, the same weight class, yeah. Yeah, so Irina usually competes in 65, I think. 65, yeah, and Brigitta was in 70 kg, yeah.
Irina Gladkaya: i know this very well both of these women because i have been in their weight classes so that's good this match is going to be very interesting i can tell that yeah it's going to be yeah it's good that they haven't um that you girls haven't met before it's going to be exciting because you both are world champions and have how many titles world champion titles do you have a brigitta uh masters and senior category all uh
Irina Gladkaya: nine and uh uh european champion and masters and senior all uh 19. wow so with with right and with left how many do you have uh separating the left and right hand uh follow manual on the left
Irina Gladkaya: 4 on the right and 5 on the left. 5 on the left. How many on the right? Right 4. And how about you Irina? How many world titles do you have with left and right?
Translator: All in all, she has 13 world titles. But she didn't count left and right. Oh, okay.
Irina Gladkaya: It's so funny. I talked to Egli before, too, and asked her the same questions. Nobody knows how many world titles they have. I think it's unusual in sports that you don't count them. Too many titles. We have too many to count. Yeah. And this is a world title match.
Irina Gladkaya: Have you ever competed in this format before, even if it wasn't at East vs. West? But have you had a supermatch format? Yeah. Start with Brigitta. Where did you have a supermatch format? Not even East vs. West, but other than that? Last year in Serbia.
Irina Gladkaya: and a little supermatch at home in Hungary. And do you like it better with the superfights or do you like it better at tournaments? Yes, with me at work.
Irina Gladkaya: Yeah, tournaments, you can meet a lot of people, you know.
Brigitta Ivánfi: But if it's just a Supermatch format, you can get to know that exact person better. You can get to know that person better if you have an exact Supermatch with that person than at a tournament, for example.
Irina Gladkaya: Yeah. So, Irina, have you had any super fights before that kind of a format? Yes, I had a fight. About a year ago. With Bela Pliva, who is the world and European champion now. European champion, 65 years old. What about Bela Pliva?
Translator: about a year ago and Bella Pliva now is European champion at 65 if I get that right and that's uh and who won
Irina Gladkaya: You won, right? Yes, I won. What was the score? 3-0. She won 3-0. 3-0. In Sweden we say 3-0 too. 3-0? We say in Sweden, yeah. So I could understand that. So, Irina, now when you know that you are meeting Brigitta, has that changed how you work out?
Translator: Was there any special preparation for Brigitta? Did you study the opponent? Did you do any special preparation? There was no special preparation, I strengthened my strengths, but I watched some fights, analyzed them, so to speak. What matches did Brigitta participate in?
Translator: She trains her strong sides, maybe. So she trains Irina's strong sides, so she gets stronger in her... In her, yes, strong sides. And tell me a little bit about how you train at the gym and also at the armwrestling table. How does the training process go? As far as iron and working at the table are concerned, roughly.
Irina Gladkaya: Well, the training process, in any case, I started with physical training, and already to the table, about a month after. The last month, probably, I stand more at the table. How many times a week?
Irina Gladkaya: Four times. Wow, I couldn't do it, I think. And about you, Brigitta, when you found out that you were going to compete against Irina, have that changed how you work out now?
Brigitta Ivánfi: Yeah, she also got to know the information two months ago, just like Irina.
Irina Gladkaya: Yes, so two months is a very short period of time, we can tell that. More technical training, yes. More technical training is at the table, so more table time basically.
Brigitta Ivánfi: So not maximum power, max effort, but more on the technical side of the training. Have you studied how Irina pulls and have you changed anything in your training?
Brigitta Ivánfi: Yeah, so she also saw her in real life, you know, how she pulls at the table, how she's moving on the technical side of it. And yeah, of course, she analyzed everything about her.
Irina Gladkaya: And how many days of a week do you train at the gym? Because we saw you today, I think I saw you. Tell us about the bicep curls. Yeah, the bicep curls.
Brigitta Ivánfi: It depends how many times she works out a week. Yeah, five times a week. So three days in the gym and the other two training sessions are at the team, you know, the training camp. We're practicing at a table, the technical side of it, and also
Brigitta Ivánfi: there's um there's a training session uh with our team when we are practicing more the technical side and there is a full power and also she's doing the workout training sessions uh with her own body weight there's so many times yeah yeah you can increase our strength very well yeah you told me mark before uh before we uh
Brigitta Ivánfi: We went live. Yeah, before we went live, yeah. But she's super strong now that she's really gonna be three... No, she didn't say that. No, no. But she's super strong now. We didn't say anything like that. We didn't say anything like that. No. But she's... But what you have to know that she did yesterday one-handed hammer curves, eight reps with 30 kg. Perfect form. Yeah.
Irina Gladkaya: and everyone was watching him everyone was watching yeah in the middle of the training session and the arena how much weight do you train when you train a hammer curls
Translator: Now I'm asking Brigitta about the training process, and she says that she does iron three times, stands at the table two or three times. Her friend said that yesterday she was impressed, she did 30 kg of hammer bending with dumbbells. Well, apparently, maybe in full amplitude, as a basic exercise, probably. And now Malina asks, don't you make hammers with dumbbells? And if you do, what are your weights there, for example? I do, 25 kg.
Irina Gladkaya: She did 25 kilograms, but with some reserve. She thinks she can do more, but she doesn't risk. Yeah. Did I get it right before? She said 35?
Translator: Twenty-five. Twenty-five. Twenty-five, okay, okay. Yes, twenty-five kg, six eight reps. Six eight reps, twenty-five. That's very solid, yeah.
Irina Gladkaya: Yeah, it's gonna be interesting. So do you think that, we can start with Brigitta, do you think that you train differently than the men do? Or do you train similar, do you think?
Brigitta Ivánfi: I think it's kind of similar to them, especially the technical and specific side of the arm wrestling training.
Irina Gladkaya: So there are a couple of exercises that are good for her.
Brigitta Ivánfi: specifically and of course uh just like everyone's doing the the basic arm wrestling exercises she's also doing the same so yeah that's basically it and sometimes she's trying out new things of course
Irina Gladkaya: If it's good or not, you know, we're trying everything. Yeah. I have had that question so many times because it's like us women don't train the same way, but I also, I just wonder if it's the same for you. And I've seen Irina also at her training sessions. So it's not so much difference, I don't think. So what do you think, Irina?
Translator: How do you think your fight will go? Will there be a fight in the ropes? What techniques can be used by the opponent? How do you see this fight?
Irina Gladkaya: I know that Brigitta has a strong side, I watched her fights, so I'm more of a top and I probably won't let her get into the hook.
Irina Gladkaya: She doesn't want to reveal her view of the match. But in general, she thinks that Brigitta's strong side is the side portion.
Irina Gladkaya: uh and uh she's a better top roller and uh so and does uh irina like irina do you like going into the straps
Irina Gladkaya: What about belts? Do you prefer to fight in belts or do you prefer to be without them? Yes, in belts, let's say, it's comfortable for me to fight. There is no such thing that I would fight only without a belt. In general, absolutely normal. Are straps okay? Maybe I can even... No, I won't say. I wanted to say, maybe I'm even stronger in belts.
Irina Gladkaya: It's okay for her to pull both straps and without. Yeah. And how about you, Brigitta? I mean, we will see how will the match go, you know. Yeah, it's fun to just think how it will go. Maybe...
Irina Gladkaya: I've watched a few matches and I can see that she has a very good start. She takes the start very quickly. Yeah, so first she saw a lot of match from Irina and she realized that she's a very fast athlete, so she can get the ready go.
Irina Gladkaya: She has to react it. And if she can get the start, then she will try to catch it. If it goes for a slip, then of course it's a strap match, and then we will see.
Irina Gladkaya: Yeah, and this is going to be like seven rounds. It's a lot. Like usually when you compete at tournaments, you compete with different competitors and you can really rest a little bit. And now it's going to be a war, like seven rounds. Yeah, so you should win at least four. Yeah. And also you can change your tactics after you have tried. Yeah, yeah.
Irina Gladkaya: so it's going to be really interesting yeah so they will have time to think it over and maybe come up with new new techniques and everything yeah new setups yeah so going into this match how do you prepare mentally uh are you people that are very nervous going in or do you feel always secure and finding the zone and we can start with the irina
Translator: Malina asks, how do you approach the fight psychologically? Do you feel any kind of anxiety or, on the contrary, do you feel some kind of confidence?
Irina Gladkaya: Well, in any case, a normal athlete, let's say, feels some kind of anxiety, but in any case, our main task, well, in fact, 75% of us, probably, still depends on the mood, that is, how you tune in, maybe it will work out. Therefore, let's say, I can fight with myself, with my inner state. Irina, do you have an extra match?
Translator: She thinks that attitude towards the match is very important. She said 75%. So it's very important. And although she feels excited, but she is sure she will manage to cope with that and do her best.
Irina Gladkaya: And with you, Brigitta, does that affect you, the mental strength or the mental... Yeah, it has a very good... It makes always a very huge impact on her. Yeah.
Brigitta Ivánfi: There are so many times when it depends on the mental state, you know, how can be there in the present, in the present time. In her opinion, she says it's maybe more important than the physical strength and conditions. Yeah.
Irina Gladkaya: Yeah, so basically the mind controls the body, yeah. So is there anything that she's doing to be more mentally prepared? Do you train anything for going there more prepared and feeling the best that day? You do whatever you can to improve your mental state.
Irina Gladkaya: Of course, and I work on it all the time, so I build up my daily routine consciously. She's trying to consciously improve it every single day, yeah. What did you say that she's doing every single day? She's trying to consciously improve herself every single day, also mentally, not just physically, yeah. It takes a huge part of her daily life, yeah.
Brigitta Ivánfi: Yeah. Very important, very essential thing.
Irina Gladkaya: Yeah, I think it's also for me, it's so big. And for me, I'm training like every time I train against, if I have a super match, I always go to the arm wrestling training and I pretend that I'm in that match. So all the guys that I'm pulling against, I say to them, okay, pretend to be Irina. And she pulls like this.
Brigitta Ivánfi: and then you know the situation you know the situation when you're at a competition or a super match and you're just basically um standing in front of the mirror and you're just trying to say that i'm the best i can beat her i can beat him yeah yeah i think also it's a it's a difficult but uh you can train it
Irina Gladkaya: So, Irina, have you noticed that the armwrestling in Russia has been growing now the last years since East vs West started and YouTube has been so big? We were discussing psychological preparation. Now the question is, have you noticed that
Irina Gladkaya: Is the sport developing now, especially in connection with the appearance of professional tournaments in Russia? Of course. I think this is one of the only competitions that are progressing to this day. Well, we don't take, probably, AMC, where only men fight, but we take East-West.
Irina Gladkaya: It seems to me that with every year, probably, plus already even now in our event, there are seven Russian athletes. This is very cool. How many are there? Seven or six? Six, one, two. Well, in almost every pair. A lot, a lot, yes. The question was probably about popularity in Russia. Did it grow with the advent of EastWest? Well, here, I think, the question is such.
Translator: Of course, yes, because people are watching. Of course, yes, because we only have East-West, where we can perform today. International competitions. Well, you can also watch it. Yes, and everyone can watch it. Yes, for sure, popularity grows in Russia. Everyone likes East-West.
Translator: And as you may notice, quite many Russian sportsmen are now in this card. So it's great. It's great for everyone.
Irina Gladkaya: It is. Yeah. I noticed also that, uh, people that are coming to arm wrestling practice that are, uh, beginners, they now know how to stand at the table, how to train. They stand more right. In the beginning, when I was younger, everybody was standing and they were like this, but it has been like starting to get really mainstream. I think, uh, Brigitta, have you noticed that, that it has changed, uh, in, in, um, Hungary?
Brigitta Ivánfi: Yes, of course. There's a lot of things that have changed in Hungary as well. So more and more people just started talking about armwrestling.
Irina Gladkaya: There are a lot of YouTube videos about it. Yeah, because there are a lot of YouTube videos and internet. And those are because of the East vs West events. Thank you, Engem. Many, many, many competitors remember this event. They connect Skander, and more and more people in Hungary know that there are Skander fans, that there are many of us, and they are more and more interested in it.
Brigitta Ivánfi: yeah so there are so many big names that are coming up in everyone's head and they can connect to to them basically the arm wrestling itself and um they just are realizing every single time that we have the sport even in hungary so yeah they're just looking up in the internet and we just uh they just find ourselves and they just go into the club and uh yeah they're starting it yeah
Irina Gladkaya: Yeah, that's awesome. How many arm wrestlers are there in Hungary? Like competitors or?
Brigitta Ivánfi: Just armwrestlers practicing or... There are almost 1500 competitors, not just guys who are doing armwrestling. So it's a lot of people. Maybe over a million.
Translator: No, that's way too high a number. And in Russia, how many? 100,000 at least. Yeah. To be honest, I don't know. The question is, how many of us in Russia participate in the Russian Championship?
Translator: We do not have the statistics, but there are very many people now.
Translator: I would say that now there are not only sportsmen, but there are fans that do not do armwrestling, but they just watch it, and that's great. I just answered the question for you, because there are a lot of people. Except for athletes, there are still a lot of fans who do not do armwrestling themselves, but watch these armwrestling fights and are just fans. I see.
Irina Gladkaya: Yeah, I've seen, when I've been to the East vs West, there is now so many fans coming too. And they will treat you like superstars. You are superstars. Worth be treating as ones. Yeah, we can surely say that. These guys are superstars, yeah. So finally, armwrestling is growing so big and we get what we deserve. We have worked so hard.
Irina Gladkaya: yeah it's just the beginning of it yeah yeah yeah it's awesome yeah so irina do you have any questions to brigitta um
Irina Gladkaya: Yelena watched Brigitta's match against Carolina and she
Translator: She's interested in what shape was Brigitta in good shape then? And what can she tell about that fight? When was that competition exactly? At the Swiss Open or at a workshop?
Brigitta Ivánfi: Swiss Open last year or when? 23. Yeah, last year. Mentally she wasn't in the best shape. Yeah, so the finals were taking place at 3 a.m. Yeah, so.
Brigitta Ivánfi: She was completely tired mentally, but somehow she managed to get a win with her right and left hand.
Brigitta Ivánfi: I felt that I was over-technical. Yeah, so she's saying that she's a little bit over-technical. She uses a lot of techniques, you know, in her mind and she totally confused herself before the match and lost the finals, unfortunately.
Translator: Vanya, translate, please. She says that she didn't do well psychologically. The finals were either very late, or at 3 o'clock at night. Well, not at 3 o'clock at night, but there was something about the time. In general, she was tired, she got confused in the techniques herself. She said that first she won, and then she lost the final. I say that, first of all, psychologically and technically,
Brigitta Ivánfi: But Carolina is technically a very strong female athlete, and she knows what she has to do against anybody. She's more smart at the table. And Carolina is the other way around. She had everything planned out. I understand. Thank you.
Irina Gladkaya: Is Irina interested in meeting Carolina in the future? Is that why she's asking? Or she's just curious? I would be interested, of course, as far as I understand,
Irina Gladkaya: Yes, I'd like to pull him one day. It would be great.
Irina Gladkaya: And Brigitta, do you have any questions for Irina? There are not so many questions. She's very excited about the championship. Yeah, and the reason is because they haven't met with each other yet at the table.
Brigitta Ivánfi: That's why she excited, yeah. She was always looking for Irina's journey, you know. She was always watching her videos on YouTube and everywhere. She posted a video, for example. She watched everything.
Irina Gladkaya: So it's a very big pleasure for her to meet with the champion. We're a big name in our wrestling, Irina, and you always...
Brigitta Ivánfi: So in Brigitta's mind, you Irina have like a very good image, like the unbeatable female athlete. Yeah. So it's very big pleasure to meet with you. Yeah. Can't wait to be there. Can't wait to be there. So Brigitta has an image about Irina that she's unbeatable, you know, and also her sister. Yeah.
Translator: Oh, it's not... Yeah, it's just... Yeah, yeah. Her teammates, sorry, not her sister. Yeah, sorry. She was watching your games for many years. You were her role model. She created an image of you as invincible. That's true. Well, she is very happy to have such an opportunity to fight you.
Irina Gladkaya: I would like to ask you how do you feel about the fact that you can't come to the European and World Championships?
Brigitta Ivánfi: So there's one more question for Irina. She would like to ask, what does it feel to, you basically cannot compete at Europeans and World Championship now, and how does it feel to you right now?
Translator: And there's another thing. Do you guys have any possibilities to compete in Russia? That's all. Yes, you answered the question, but you already talked about it at the very beginning. I'm just asking again, how important is it for you to participate in East-West against the background of the fact that you haven't competed in the world for 2-3 years?
Irina Gladkaya: Mark asked if we have anything to fight for in Russia. In Russia, we definitely have something to fight for. In Russia, there are just different events of such an entertaining nature. But these are completely different things. Professional competitions and entertainment events. Therefore, this is the only competition where I really want, I would like.
Translator: For me, for now, they are at the first place where I would like to get from the bottom of my heart, and I will get there, finally. Irina says that for sure there are some tournaments and there is armwrestling in Russia in different formats, but East-West is the only place she really wants to participate, the only one.
Translator: So she's really excited about it. There are tournaments in Russia, there are Russian nationals and many, many regional tournaments, some commercial tournaments as well, like MC, but they are for men mostly. But still East-West is the only tournament she really would like to participate in.
Irina Gladkaya: okay thank you great to know that great to know that not sure but uh how can we talk event event yes yeah yeah that's awesome and then i promised irina we will take we will do this for 45 minutes because she has other plans i think after this but i am super excited to see you girls in turkey in two weeks and i'm gonna be there
Irina Gladkaya: I will be able to watch this live. I look forward also to Carolina and Dimitrina. Of course, that will also be really fun to watch. I wish you both the best. Thank you for being in this show and thank you everyone that is watching. I haven't seen any questions. Everybody is just rooting for you two in the chat.
Irina Gladkaya: but thank you so much and see you in two weeks thank you guys thank you wish you all the best bye-bye
