Unknown: Hello, everyone. Travis is coming in a minute.
Engin Terzi: Hello, great to see you guys. I had some jet lag because of my South Korea trip. It was a great trip. South Korean friends are very respectful. They show me great hospitality. Hello, Lasha.
Engin Terzi: Hello, Lambman Gaming. Hello, Drew. Hello, my friend. Megaslice. Hello, Armwrestling Opera. Hello, Old Scratch. Good day to you as well. Greetings to Belgrade. Yeah, except some jet lag, everything is fine. Hello, Ivan. Hello, guy. Great to see you, my friends. Coffee and milk.
Engin Terzi: Okay. Pageant just came. Travis, the other way. Come on, man. Why won't it turn with me? It won't turn with me? Yes, because you are not the same Travis Pageant. In the past, it was just automatically turning for you. That motherfucker is not going to turn. If I do that, no good?
Travis Bagent: Oh, it says my rotation is locked. How are you, Travis? What is this, like Doritos and things like that? Oh, it's just a box to make it tall enough to kind of look down. If you're a professional podcaster, you would know that the angle of the camera you want higher looking down at you.
Engin Terzi: I really don't care about that one. I know. Well, you're the boss. Boss does what he wants. I'm not boss. I'm the servant. Servants. I'm the servant. You call me boss. Like, who is serving more than me? Like, I'm sure there are some people, but, like, boss, like, boss just sits down and, you know, it's not me.
Travis Bagent: You the boss, you the boss, player. Ain't no doubt about it. You the boss. Hey, listen, I was thinking about our interview and I was thinking how we could do better. Okay. So just my, and once again, you the boss. I don't want to overstep your bounds. No, no, no. You're talking about which interview? Right now, this podcast? I believe, I believe that, no, I'm talking about right now, what we're doing.
Travis Bagent: Traditionally, we would start from the bottom and work ourselves to the main event. But I feel like we lose our energy. We never lose our energy. Well, I'm talking about me. I got a couple of one-liners. I'm ready to do this. If you ask me about the first match, I might blow it all right there. So if you don't mind, think about it, boss. We start from the top and work ourselves there.
Engin Terzi: If you do that, you're going to lose the view. No, there's too many matches. No, there's too many matches, man. No, you're going to lose the view. The middle of this thing is historic. Once you go from middle to top, it's crazy. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I agree. I agree, yeah. I won't be humble about it. I have no doubt this is the best arm wrestling event card ever, you know.
Engin Terzi: I'm going to miss a professional football game to be sure that I am in attendance to this card. Yeah, because this is historical. If you would be missing, it would be terrible. If John tells me now he wants to come as well, I mean, I will want John as well because
Engin Terzi: Unfortunately, Levan will not be there because Levan doesn't like to travel a lot. So he is training and he will travel for his match against Jerry. But other than that, Denis Diplenko will be there. Most likely, Kirill Starshev will be there. Arsen Liliyev is coming. Artem Morozov is coming. Hermes Gasparini is coming. And it will be a huge event, yeah.
Travis Bagent: so let's let's go let's go travis i mean to the top start at the top start at the top the top one but the top one might not be the main event it's not the main event to uh to the arm wrestlers it's just it's the main event i mean don't get me wrong it's high it's high quality
Travis Bagent: It's high quality. Just tell me whatever you feel. Yeah. I mean, let's just, it doesn't matter. You asked me the question. Ask me the question. Which match you want to start with? There are some matches that I feel that I can't give justice to, but I know you can. But I know that you know the ones that I'm ready to talk about. Which one did you say?
Travis Bagent: I just know that there's so, I was looking at the card and there's probably three matches, maybe four, where I don't know enough about both competitors and I feel like- Okay, I will ask you and you can say you don't know. Because even if you don't know one of the athletes, still hard to predict because you know one, but you don't know who is the opponent. Of course. And hard to predict, listen, hard to predict when you know both athletes. Oh yeah, yeah, but there's different reasons.
Engin Terzi: Baba, that's a different reason. Hard to predict because the match is close. Hard to predict because you don't know the other guy. Two different things. Yeah. OK, let's start. Do you know Brigitta from Hungary? She's world champion armwrestler, and her opponent is Irina Gladkaya. I am not familiar with both at the point that I could. I've watched them both just recently just to try to get ready for the interviews and stuff.
Travis Bagent: You know, the one thing about the chicks, man, is the heart is always there. So you really can't go wrong there. I'm really looking more to the other women's match. I definitely have some opinions on that, but I am not familiar enough. Okay, you are not familiar because you haven't seen them at the East versus West. This is the first time, you know. But they both love world champions.
Engin Terzi: In what weight class? 121? 165? No, 143, 154. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, legitimate, the winner will pull in the same category as the other girls' match. Is that correct? Or is the other match? No, no, no. Other match is 132 pounds world title. This is 154. The winner of this match may get this title for FIA RISE Tech for the future world title match.
Engin Terzi: Okay, Azat from Armenia and Danil Ustinov from Kazakhstan. One is the current 70kg world champion who was going to pull against Hunter, and then Hunter had an injury, health problem, and then he's going to pull against Danil for the world title.
Travis Bagent: Are you familiar? You watched some? Not familiar, but I was investigating to see if Hunter was how big of trouble that he was in. And I did come to the conclusion that he was in big trouble anyway, especially with him trying to lose that weight. So, yeah, it'll be interesting. I think that...
Engin Terzi: after he watches this too. So you tell me, what do you think? I don't know. I think that if Hunter would hook, you understand, Azat, I think that he had a very good chance. And Hunter's hooking ability is very good. So we will see. Do you think that Hunter should be pulling 170 kilos?
Engin Terzi: 170 pounds category or you think you should where do you think that because 170 170 is where hunter is stronger but then competition level also goes to another level when you have arthur macaro min davas daniel prokopchuk all those guys now like yeah you feel stronger but the guys are like the guys in
Engin Terzi: one higher category is tougher than the guys one lower. I'm not saying tougher because they are bigger. That is naturally tougher category because all these guys I mentioned are world champions multiple times. So they are more,
Engin Terzi: Like Azat and Danil Ustinov, they just won their first world title this year. You understand? But Danil, Minda, Bas, Artur, these guys are all, how to say, very experienced, very established. You understand? Like their technique and everything. So, yeah. I believe that an American that is ever going
Travis Bagent: under 200 pounds has to be also a master of weight loss so to me there is only one belt that hunter has an option for he's got one hell mary's chance of beating a 154 pound athlete and grabbing one of those belts
Travis Bagent: At 170, the competition's too crazy, and it's too big, and to me, it's not happening. Now, he can have a great career at 170 if you pick his opponents correctly, but if you shoot him to the top of the 170 class for a belt, it's going to be a problem. Now, here's a bigger problem.
Travis Bagent: Can Hunter lose the weight? Is he a master of that psychology? To me, Todd Hutchings is a master at losing weight as well.
Travis Bagent: To me, he has an opportunity, Todd, to always drop one more and really get one of those belts. Now, Todd also may have the ability, unlike any other American, to grab a belt without losing weight. Travis, like I said this, I mentioned this a few times on my community post or Facebook post. When I like became
Engin Terzi: like part of armwrestling, like all the legends of armwrestling were from North America, especially, I mean, I shouldn't say especially, but for sure in lightweights too. Those Cobra, Chet Silvers, Dave Patton, Fisher and Jerry Jennings and many others. So what I'm just saying, like we, like we cannot really accept current
Engin Terzi: situation as like a forever case. That is my goal. Every nation, every nation should really start believing in themselves and getting involved. And then like you say, yes, today only one looks like, according to you, Tartashins. And he has a very good chance because he has beaten the current world champion of 209.
Engin Terzi: Irakli Zirakashvili, but they should not be accepted by the North Americans. We should really get involved. And a lot of people I see, oh, let me be in my small world, you understand? And then I have even seen people are writing, oh, the elite armwrestling lost its charm and something. Elite armwrestling isn't
Travis Bagent: Lucy's charm, Elliot's arm wrestling, just became as tough as it has, I mean, never been, you understand? And we cannot just escape from the... And how many years away are we between before the tidal wave of this conversation, right? Like three years from now, there's a kid, there's a human being, whether it's Paul Lynn, who just...
Travis Bagent: the tidal wave of what we are doing, the promotion. And then the story will be, Ingen, it was just a short two years ago, I was telling you, we didn't have a guy. Now, come to find out, there's four brand new guys in there. And when I say brand new,
Travis Bagent: They're not brand new. They're Brandon Oseltor, who now, because of the title wave of the level, is the level that Brandon Oseltor was trying to get to was to beat Paul Lynn at the WAL finals. Now, the level of commitment for a guy like Brandon Oseltor, we don't know what the title wave is going to, we don't know the result from it.
Travis Bagent: we will see what the landscape and it's not just i mean everywhere is being exposed and what they're being exposed to is the level
Travis Bagent: And listen in, in how many days, 10 days, 14 days, I don't know how many days we're out today, like 16 days later, competition will be there. When that tournament is over, you need to gather every losing opponent and you need to put a poster and you will see that the greatest of great are.
Travis Bagent: having a tough time in Istanbul and it will show you that what is happening is never we never been around a group of this many star athletes that are putting it on the line it dude everything is changing and listen
Travis Bagent: I don't know if you're familiar with that. It's hard to make $1,000, not as hard to make $2,000. And then all of a sudden, you get to a place where it's easier to make $10 million after you have $5 million. You can do it in one day.
Travis Bagent: What we're seeing, man, this card is going to be, listen, it's going to send the same shockwave that went through Orlando. Now it's happening again because of the dude. And the next time that you show up in the United States, it's over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Next event in the US, Orlando event was great, but we didn't really think that there would be that many people.
Engin Terzi: Orlando event tickets were sold out eight days before the event. I had to add some premium tickets, you understand? I just changed the walkout place from front to the side, so there would be more place. But what I'm just saying, we take better cards. When I say better cards, that we need to bring some more Eastern superstars there.
Engin Terzi: And then next event, there will be, I'm telling you, minimum 1,500 to 2,000 people. And then it will go to arena for 5,000 people. And I cannot, when you are talking, Travis, I don't think that there is anyone better than you. And you get so much experience. You already know arm wrestling at this level. And you already get so much experience about the world-level arm wrestling by commentating in Istanbul. So I can already see you commentating
Engin Terzi: to like during the 5,000 people live there event, you understand? When you were talking, I was just dreaming about that one, but you know, everything starts with a dream.
Travis Bagent: It's about that. It's getting ready to go down, man. It's going to go down. I cannot believe that that many amazing people are about to put it on the line here, boy. It is match after match. It's crazy. Let's start at the top, man. What are we doing? I told you this was going to happen. We've already been here half hour. We haven't even spoke yet about my guys. Okay. Hey, Travis. Catabolic T-Rex is asking, hey, Travis, who is your favorite dinosaur?
Travis Bagent: Now, is this a legitimate question, like the prehistoric animals, or am I supposed to read dinosaur? I have no idea. I have no idea. Let me see. Where do I gravitate in the dinosaur department? I would say a shark. Yeah, the great white shark here is still considered a dinosaur. It's just it's still around. So I think that's the way I would roll probably.
Engin Terzi: Okay, let's go. You watched the match of Rabidin Jr. against the Georgii guy? I did, yeah, I did. Okay, that guy is Nugo, Nugzari Chikadze. Yeah, I've been around Nugo twice now, so yeah, good job. And he is going to pull against the Turkish guy Oguzhan Koçak. Oguzhan Koçak, maybe you don't know, he is world champion.
Engin Terzi: He has won world titles in, I think, 80 kilo, 85 kilo, 100 kilo. He has wins against Marcio Barboza, and he was like 189 pounds. He has beaten Flamand Dimitrov, Sasho, Krasimir, Jordan Tsitsonev, and many others he has wins against. And right now he's going to pull against a guy who has beaten Rabidjian in Dubai.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, and Nugo, yeah. And, you know, what we know is that it's going to be crazy exciting, and we see this upward trajectory. The problem with the East-First West is, listen, the opponent's going to be tough, too. So you're saying this is a Turkish guy who is probably the most important day of his life, I would imagine, will be the day that he can
Travis Bagent: I mean, it would be useless for me to tell you who's going to win, but listen, it doesn't get much better than the excitement that Nugo's bringing and the passion that must be in this Turkish man's heart. So, you know, I'm excited to see it. It'll be a great way to get the energy started in the room. And you will get to know...
Engin Terzi: Oguzhan as well, if he gets another match at the East versus West, so you will have an idea when you watch him closely. But do you remember Nugzari also against the Ukrainian guy, Petrova Marharin? He lost 3-2. He won the first two rounds, and then Marharin beat him 3-2. Anyways, the exciting Georgii guy. Anyways, let's go to the next one. Artur Makarov versus Ömer Faruk Kozekoğlu.
Engin Terzi: These guys, you know, Artur, you know, he has like different genetic of the hand and wrist. And Ömer Farukozakol is also the same way, but more likely his case is like Oleg Zhokh type of, you know, genetic Ömer. And they are going to pull for the 77 kilo world title match. Ömer is the current 80 kilo world champion. And Artur is many times world champion in...
Travis Bagent: and right now he's the current East vs. West World Champion. Yeah, Artur's interesting to me. Very interesting to me because it almost looks like he doesn't think he can lose.
Travis Bagent: in the setup but his hand as awesome as it is it also seems really compromisable right at the end he's so tucked in it's really it's really awkward it looks like early in the matches he is just completely overwhelmingly dominant and then
Travis Bagent: there seems to be just an opening for, you know, not that Mandaugas had an opening, but you could just see that as the rounds went on. Yes, yes, round one was, yeah. Just the pinky finger, the ring finger, they start getting a little awkward, and then he looked,
Travis Bagent: a little awkward trying to finish right there at the bottom. So if you're, you're mentioning the Olav Zook comparison. So what you're telling me is this guy is totally trying to get outside, create an uncomfortable connection. You didn't look at his photos, right? This guy's photos. No, but you're talking big, huh? I will, I will.
Travis Bagent: try to find for you very quick. Should I have a podcast with both guys? Now, is this a traditional? Is this a traditional? Because to me, Oleg's hand and size is amazing. But also the positioning of the thumb compared, you know, in the webbing to me is what Oleg's biggest advantage is. So there's a difference in having
Engin Terzi: Yeah, this guy is like, this is 170 pounds. Um, and I will.
Engin Terzi: Try to send you, but when you, when you grab Artur, when Artur's does he, is he wrapping? Does he have the finger length to wrap around the back of your hand? Or is it more of a, he can, he can not really, he doesn't usually like to pull without the strap. He likes to pull with the strap. He is not comfortable. And sometimes he can't really put this finger. He doesn't himself.
Engin Terzi: so his hand is like big but i don't think that he has also so comfortable grip for himself so his style depending more like hold and then pressure not like not like wrists but just hold it and pull it he doesn't have that like really good henry this guy other guy is opposite way the other other guy is
Engin Terzi: More likely the hand control guy. Not like... I will show you right now. Maybe you will remember when you see the photo. And that guy is really... One second. Have they ever pulled before? No, no, no. No, he didn't. I will try to...
Travis Bagent: show you his hand and wrist but oh yeah he's got a little something going on here well listen that's gotta be to me that's where you would attack i think arthur's situation to me looks like coming forward you could still be in a bad position and yes yes yes yeah this guy is tall this guy is your height he's pulling 170 but he's your height omer very very
Engin Terzi: long forearm, he will probably keep himself like this to avoid the hook. And he's going to look a lot like Matt mask up there with that, with those finger knuckles pointed straight to him. He's like, like posting, but he will have a great control. I didn't, my, my shape is now 50%, but whenever I hold his hand, just, I said, let me just feel. And then whenever I hold, I felt like here is super powerful.
Engin Terzi: around here, like he's generating some weird power that you and I wouldn't be because of the different type of genetics. Does Artur have the, does he have the Genadi broke arm push as well in his arsenal? No, no, no, no. Once Artur is like this, I think he will lose the match. Okay. Artur doesn't. So either, either,
Engin Terzi: Artur just side pressure pins him or something. Or Artur hooks him. Or I think that he will lose the match if somehow it's not hook or not a flash pin. If he hooks him, most likely he will beat him. But if he cannot hook him and if the match stops, most likely he will lose his wrist. Or he will just pull and do the straight side pressure to pin him. Yeah. And I...
Engin Terzi: I think that it will be a good one. So let's go about the next one. Let's go to the top. Let's go to the top and work ourselves down. We are going. We are going. You are disrespecting the other matches. No, I don't want to disrespect them. I just know the time is going on. We're going to end up disrespecting the best matches. No, we will have energy for all of them. We'll hit the two-hour limit.
Travis Bagent: Yeah. Okay, Dimitrina Petrova and Carolina Petrova, world title match. Right arm. Yeah, this is awesome. This is awesome. One is 60 kilo. One is 60 kilo world champion. Yeah, this is not as awesome if we didn't just witness what we saw. And in comparison, when they were both together in different matches, right? Yeah. And what we saw was...
Travis Bagent: There's an outside. There's an outside. Well, I mean, listen. That was a very tough match, right? I mean, old girl was in trouble the whole time in that lightweight match, right? I mean, hold on. I just got to knock at my door. Hold on. Okay. Okay.
Travis Bagent: All right, cool. So how do I say the champ's name? Can I say Dima? Dimitrina. Yeah, but what's her little nickname? Like I heard, like everybody was just saying. I don't know, I don't know. Dimitrina? Dimitrina? Yeah.
Travis Bagent: How do you say Dimitrina? Dimitrina, the name, this is Dimitrina? No, because it's a woman, Dimitrina Petrova, from Carolina. Well, Dimitrina, so what I saw from her is that she, listen, she could really not be the champ too. I mean, she was in an absolute...
Travis Bagent: that Asian lady was amazing, right? Amazing. Now we watch, and listen, I mean, how do you say, it's just Carolina, right? I say Carolina, I think. Carolina? All right, I got you. Carolina, yeah. And then she's like the MVP of the East versus West. Like, she is the most wholesome woman
Engin Terzi: Oh, yeah, he's got it. Man, that looks like... Look at the hand. Yeah, that looks like Dennis' hand. Look at the separation of the knuckles, man. That dude's hand is huge. And look at this wrist. This wrist is, like, whenever I felt, this wrist is generating, like, something different. Like, it doesn't matter how strong you are. When something is there, I felt, like, super strong.
Engin Terzi: Like, he's still, he's beatable. He won the world, but he lost to Aydar Khan. You remember Aydar Khan? Of course. Aydar Khan beat him, but Aydar Khan had like very little tiny fouls, but Aydar Khan was better. But Aydar Khan is incredibly explosive. This guy is not the first, and this is his youth category.
Engin Terzi: cooler this guy that's scary so what i'm just saying just give him two years three years then we will have probably another oleg zok you know yeah no doubt no doubt all right so okay right yeah so and she's like the most exciting
Travis Bagent: like she's like winning the match of the day every time out so i don't see that explosiveness that i saw you know from the asian lady i don't see that in in her but we also know that there's an outside area that you know the matrinas definitely can be exposed to so i think that this one here this one's
Travis Bagent: This one could be 3-0, Dimitrina, not very interesting, or everybody on their feet, 100%, nine minutes total arm wrestling in the middle of the match. And, you know, I mean, if she wins, the place is going to go crazy. Yeah. Travis, your paycheck went down by 25% somewhere.
Travis Bagent: It went down? Yeah, because you said 3-0 for the world title match. I'm just saying, like, that's how dominating... No, no. It cannot be 3-0. Oh, okay. Yeah, I got you. 4-0, 4-0. I'm joking. And listen, that helps her. That helps her too, man. That helps her. Yeah. And did you know that they pull, not this year, but the last year in Kazakhstan WAF, they did the final, these two.
Travis Bagent: Yeah. And you know, she told me that, I mean, they all, I mean, I was seated with the, with the Swedish girls. They had, their predictions were wrong the whole time. They thought Egla was going to win. Right. And they also thought. Oh, you're talking about the other matches.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, so both the girl matches, they thought that Dimitrina was 100% going to win easy, and they thought that Egna was going to win. So they were both incorrect and very impressed. And I believe that that's where they get the confidence to now think that they can win. It's going to be good. Okay.
Travis Bagent: Oleg Zhokh vs. Betkili Oniani. That is the arm that you are interested in. Come on, man. Listen, I told you to go to the top. This is the top right here. This is the top. This is it right here because this is what... Yeah, because you know, when you have a guy that can pull lighter, that it can pull heavier, and then they both could be in the same category, but...
Travis Bagent: listen that kelly's a a a weird mean mean mean aggressive guy man i think that the only thing that can stop him from winning is and i don't want to wish no bad luck but he's so aggressive and i believe that this means
Travis Bagent: so much to him. Even, listen, he walks around to me like he thinks he's better than anybody in his country. You know what I mean? Like, he's the guy. He can be the most dominant guy, his left arm in his category, as good as LeVon, as good as Genadi, as erectly, you know, I mean, be careful saying anything about the great Samushia. Now, there is no greater than him.
Travis Bagent: No doubt. I just feel that as long as he doesn't get hurt, because he's coming, the commitment's coming, and we all know that the connection that Oleg can present, it can be awkward at best, right? But listen, this thing is setting for...
Travis Bagent: Betkili to not only win, but to be nasty aggressive. And if you don't have a competitive advantage like Oleg does, I'm not sure there's a more dominant human being than Betkili Oniani. That's just my opinion. So you are saying that Betkili is going to win? The only way he doesn't win is if it's just
Engin Terzi: So much he can't continue, but I think he's the winner. I think he's the guy. When you say Batkill is aggressive, you feel that aggression, right? He doesn't show. His face is just so cold. You could see his face the same when he's reading a book or he's fishing or he's arm wrestling. He doesn't show any emotion. I don't see him restraining or something.
Travis Bagent: How do you feel his aggression? I do not feel that he is ever that impressed with the situation, you know, which is to me, it, I mean, I feel it. Like I feel animosity towards the community on his behalf, like that. And it's not negative. It's that, yo man, I'm a bad, bad dude. He's making a statement at the table, not only by arm messing, but he's with his
Travis Bagent: how to say, with his look. His presence. His whole energy. The man's got presence. He's got energy. He is a scary person to me when it comes to, if you want to be in a competition against this guy, you better get ready, man, because he is capable of, listen, whatever it takes, he will get you. Yes. Bad, bad.
Engin Terzi: bad dude man okay travis travis yoshinobi kanai versus tatachins you do you remember yoshinobu's best years like when he pulled against michael todd and rambat i don't know if you were there in any of those events yeah um i know that you guys had uh some dominance against them with john but that year you guys were just like unstoppable and john was like in a
Travis Bagent: differently you know no doubt yeah yeah i've been around yoshi there's been times when yoshi would have beat me and we were all arm wrestling just not that day in japan i agree yeah yeah you guys were untouchable yeah yeah this is interesting just because i believe that there there's not really a weight the weight thing is weird with yoshi because yoshi is
Travis Bagent: big but not big you know in two ways so i just know that what yoshi had at one point was he was extremely hard to pin extremely hard to pin it's a little bit of
Travis Bagent: Angles and situations where there's that last two inches that, listen, and I'm not saying Yoshi can't do it another way. I'm just telling you that when I see the matchup, the only thing that I'm looking for is how does the match end? Does Todd suck him on Todd's side of the table, or is it just straight sideways? Yes.
Engin Terzi: Does the thing start to come towards Yoshi's side at any point? Two or three. And then if he stops them, Yoshi will not deviate. He will not try out. Yeah, I agree with you. Yeah, perfectly. I was afraid that you were going to underestimate Kanai. But there may be a dominance as well. But if it is not a dominant match, if that match stops somewhere,
Engin Terzi: It will be a long match. Because, yes, John beat Kanai in Japan. One match was very, very hard. And one time when you guys went, he dominated. But John was in incredible level. And John took everything. Todd doesn't have the killing hand control and dominating the pronation and taking everything. Todd is going without the control as well.
Engin Terzi: So when you go without the control and you miss Kanai's pronator, and he still has the pronator. If you don't dominate him like this, but you just pull him like this, you're leaving his pronator. And then he stops you here. The guy resists. The guy will resist. If he's in good shape, guy will resist no less than Ongarbe resists. If he's in shape, guy will resist in the same position that Prudnik stopped
Travis Bagent: uh todd in orlando can i will resist much more than that only it just looks for a sub but there is a possibility we've even seen can i resist longer levers than todd so he's not even going to be upset with the height elbow to hand this is listen and the only thing that we all gotta you know to make sure that we can
Travis Bagent: if we play this back, that we also understand that Todd Hutchings also could get in that position where we all think that it is the place where Kanai and the reason the match was made
Travis Bagent: and then todd could also look at all of us and be like come on guys most people care when their hands like this but i'm just gonna raise up and then drag even further and he may kill him but i'm telling you can i once there's a problem he's not going anywhere and it doesn't matter how long
Travis Bagent: It takes and a lot of energy. My man starts. It's a slow start, but it's an extreme finish if he can take it to some weird place. So listen, I don't think this does anything wrong for Todd's legacy. I don't think anything changes for Todd's trajectory.
Travis Bagent: This is one of those matches that if you don't have the information that you have in your brain, this match probably doesn't even get made. I don't wanna root against Todd when it comes to the match being long and drawn out and entertaining.
Engin Terzi: But the match was created for the option of it being long, unbelievably drawn out, and crazily entertaining. Yes, yes, yes. If Todd doesn't dominate, that event will be a nightmare. Especially if he stops at the middle.
Engin Terzi: Like, I kind of believe that he will be, because this guy is good like this, good like this, good like this, good like this. And sometimes I see him being beat by shoulder pressure, which Todd doesn't have.
Travis Bagent: And let's be also honest too about Todd's, what he has shown us the last few years. Each of the three years, he has given us six or seven months of he's absolutely unbeatable. And then right around match three or four,
Travis Bagent: there is a stumble, right, in the article. So this is another, is Todd Hutchings learning from staying in 100% perfect condition 12 months of the year? Is he at the stumble state or are we witnessing him correcting the things that have happened the last couple of years and maybe
Travis Bagent: not only the best Todd Hutchings, but the best arm wrestler in the United States by far. That's what we could be seeing. Because he might just run through, he might run through Yoshi, give the signal and then tell you, hey, come on, man. I don't want to leave this stage again without a belt. Do you think that Todd, like before this year, like winning two matches and then losing one match thing,
Engin Terzi: Is it because of nonstop preparation and hard to keep himself at the max? Or is it because every other match is getting harder? Or just every match is equally 50-50.
Travis Bagent: It's just, and usually it's the old way of arm wrestling. That would have took him four years to have those four or five matches. But because of the, first of all, I mean, how easy is he to work with from your standpoint?
Travis Bagent: There can't be an easier, more awesome athlete, right? You call him on the phone and he tells you right away if he can or can't do it. And he does not bug you probably at all about when you tell him a potential matchup. There is no anxiety. So because of his availability, willingness, his unbelievable brand value, it's a situation where he's probably arm wrestling more than if you wanted to hoard
Travis Bagent: your brand a little bit you would stretch him out a little bit longer but i think he's on a mission i think that uh his his lack of of caring so much and being such a man's man when it comes to the way he handles his business that it's uh it's awesome i know it's got to be awesome for you it's gotta be yeah yeah yeah yeah i love it i love it he's good
Engin Terzi: And people are talking about Uzi's flight will be longer. I think Kanai's flight from Japan to here will be longer than the flight that Todd will have here, but a little bit more, a little bit longer, I think. Let's go to the next one. Rino Matic versus Ibragim Sagov.
Travis Bagent: Press versus press. I love, I love Travis. I love like crazy. I mean, talk about, I mean, Rino too, man. Talk about him not being afraid to just get after it. I mean, listen, Rino is destined to be a title holder, maybe both hands one of these days in
Travis Bagent: in this in this league i mean you're talking about extraordinarily sick crazy talented dude that listen he's gonna win all that it's gonna happen but it's not it's not gonna happen this time not with this dude
Travis Bagent: Listen, I'm a Cygolf fanatic. I mean, first of all, I can see him. Why are you a Cygolf fanatic? Just the attitude. Just the presence, the attitude. And listen, sometimes you lose. If you lost in East vs. West 9, you lost in East vs. West 11, you may have lost in East vs. West 13. Who knows? But here's the deal.
Travis Bagent: Sometimes you get the matches that are just another superstar. So, listen, both of these guys have had losses. Both of these guys, man, are bad dudes. In my opinion, Ibragim Sagov is going to win. And listen, he's going to keep on winning. He's going to be tough to beat anywhere in that class. You think he's going to beat Rino?
Travis Bagent: I mean, well, listen, I don't, I do, I don't like, like, even when I saw Rino sneak in that left against... Malchenko? Yes, which I'm wondering, I mean, did Malchenko allow that to happen or did Rino this close of being... I think it had a lot to do with the start of that match.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, which is awesome. The fact that if Rino can get up, listen, any start that Rino can get to beat that man is amazing. Like for his age, his experience level. I mean, I think Rino's got a chance. It's awesome. And because of that, I can't say that he's going to get swept. But this match is going to be awesome. And Saigon's going to have the belt when it's over. Okay.
Engin Terzi: And Rino is going to gain a lot of experience, which is going to prepare him for one day. Okay. The question, this is different than what is the card we are talking about. Devon's most likely next step will be 115 kg world title. And so according to you, he will be pulling Ibragim Sagov.
Engin Terzi: Yes. I have seen Ibragim Sagov pressing that way, this way, that way, but just pressing. And then we know that when Devon goes that way, he may be vulnerable for a really strong shoulder pressure. Do you think that Ibragim Sagov is the person that possess the most danger for
Engin Terzi: Devon or in 115 kilo, someone like Matyushenko who has the hook inability but not press, has more. Or someone going outside in that category.
Travis Bagent: Like, what do you think? Yeah, I think that, I think Cygolf's got all the tools that he needs to pull Devon a various bunch of ways. But I think it's more of how I feel about Devon. I believe that every single time that Devon Laird competes for a world championship at East First West, that it is 50-50.
Travis Bagent: And that's just the way it is because the way the devil is not favorites. No, not now. Listen, also to let's put in let's let's put that in context, like because that could be a slight on Devon's brand or you can be more realistic and say that he's the most amazing person in the world that could pull three or four classes and be a 50 50.
Travis Bagent: uh opponent for any champion who ideally each champion is pulling at their most ideal weight and they can't do what he can do cygolf can't lose the weight and pull petrenko right cygolf can't gain the weight and beat levon but this guy devin can do it the problem is is that each individual weight class at the very most cream top
Travis Bagent: It's 50-50. Like, in my opinion, it's 50-50 for Devon on November 2nd. It will be 50-50 with Devon against Rino or Cygolf. It will be 50-50 when Devon pulls anybody if that belt is on the line. Okay. And Davit Samushia versus Alexander.
Travis Bagent: I cannot disrespect my man any longer. This is Vladimir Maiorov. Vladimir Maiorov. But you're getting used to it. You're getting used to it. No doubt. I am so impressed with both of these guys. I mean, listen. Samushia is already... Listen, that's it. I don't even... Can I cut you five seconds? Yes. You are a legend in arm wrestling.
Engin Terzi: But trust me, if we somehow reach the mainstream level, your career as a commentator will be even more legendary than your armwrestling career. Yeah. And listen, how many years would the East versus West have to continue from starting right now for it to develop? I think if we stay united in
Travis Bagent: Not 2025 2025, you'll be like this 2026. We'll be like, we will be 5,000 years. Does the East first West have to continue from today to manufacture a champion that has been able to defend his title? As much as it's going to take 20 years. I don't think so. I don't think so. They will, they will end. No.
Engin Terzi: Nobody will be. Right. So you're talking about it doesn't matter. Yeah. Maybe Levan could do it, but Levan pulls twice a year. So he needs to go. He just won one time against Levan. And then if he goes like this, he needs to go five and a half years. And he also can't up the weight class and do what he did against Sasho. You know, like Levan doesn't have that. No, no, no, no. Sasho didn't go up. Sasho went down.
Travis Bagent: like how much it didn't go up social went down right i'm just like the unbelievable like the unbelievable span that our guy has is on has already cemented him in the mount rushmore for our whole lifetime in the next lifetime it'll take multiple generations in order for there to be a guy under 200 pounds that
Travis Bagent: If, especially because of the competition, it's just getting worse and worse and worse. And the ability to repeat that multiple times will be almost impossible. So we're talking about somebody. But once again, I can't believe I'm saying this. This is like 51-49. We already know that my guy had just started getting back. Yes, yes, yes. Travis, I love that you are not coming here.
Travis Bagent: Like, we're just spending time, you know, you are just talking about exactly what you, you know what we are talking about. And what do you, how do you think he, like, no one knows more than him as to the preparation that he had, the feeling it felt in the match that he was right there. Did you, what did you think about when you saw him against Adam Wozniacki?
Travis Bagent: I mean, listen, it's a sad reality right now is that our, we have a, if we take that hook and we put it in our lunchbox and in our luggage and we bring it over there, it's a tough thing. If you're bringing, and I love Adam to death, but Adam... No, no, what I'm just saying is I'm very impressed by... Yeah, of course. Yeah. Very impressed. Do you agree, do you agree that to beat Samushia,
Engin Terzi: you need to dominate his pronator. Like even taking his wrist and leaving his pronator. You need to do exactly what he did to Adam. That Adam, he just 100% did it to Adam. Yes, yes. That is why I think that Vladimir, I don't know if he's strong enough or if he has the endurance enough, but I think the right playing style to beat Samushia. Because you need to really dominate that pronator so he cannot resist.
Engin Terzi: Once you leave it here, even I'm telling you, you take his wrist, you leave his pronator, he's pressing you. He pressed like this to my row. He pressed like this either hand. He pressed like this. I show, you know, so like for me, if I would pull him, I would just only focus on here, not here because he's going to beat your brachial radialis with the shoulder pressure as well. Yeah. This is man. This is so close, man. It's so close. And it's,
Travis Bagent: It's painful to not, like, honestly, we should be saying that Samushia 100%, why would you vote against the champ? There's no way the champ can lose. Champ's going to win. Champ done shows you every time, no matter how deep the water is, he's good. It's going to be really close. 49-51.
Travis Bagent: Yes. Yeah, I agree. Especially early. Early, it's going to be awful. I mean, it's going to, yeah. But, I mean, I've said it before, man. How can you road against, how can you predict against the champ? I mean, it's crazy, too. This thing is going to be so close. I agree. I agree. And I don't know why I see early rounds without Dimitrina.
Engin Terzi: but getting balanced at the middle of the super match god knows where it will end up you know it is incredible wow each versus west 15 incredible yeah let's go let's go to the next one and look at there even the non-world title matches we have vitaly laletin versus georgie designer like you saw george against against revas 160 or 170 kilo he was
Engin Terzi: um so we are talking about what 360 pounds or something and and then now he's gonna pull against lalatin um i believe that i believe that um like morozov is more technical and but without the hand i think that this i don't know has like
Engin Terzi: he has more horsepower. This is what I believe. And I believe that there is a possibility if that match stops, I think that the way that Hermes pulled against Laletin, you know, back pressure starting. The problem that Morozov had, first of all, Morozov right now is very big. Morozov, when he pulled Laletin, wasn't that big. He was still like the same shape that he was.
Engin Terzi: he showed against Alex Kurdeca. Not the shape that he was last year before his stomach problem that he was getting ready for Levan. But right now he looks like Morozov looks that way. But another thing is that Morozov is one of the slowest guys. Morozov just stops people and then beats. While Laletin is probably the most explosive super heavyweight. Even Hermes stopped him here. He couldn't really match. And
Engin Terzi: So my opinion is that Morozov made a mistake by not really loading a lot before the goal against Vitalii and tried to match his start. You cannot do this. You cannot. Because until Morozov was at his 80, Vitalii already hit him with his 100. So what needed to happen? I'm not saying that Morozov would beat Laletin that day.
Engin Terzi: but still he made a strategic mistake you know i don't think he performed anything and i think if if this i don't know really loads loads loads loads and then somehow when because lalitin has very strong hand but lalitin's wrist is not like super strong he is also finger strong and then pronating so he's not really dominating the pronator unless you get him in hook and he easily gets your pronator
Engin Terzi: So with a really good back pressure, and if Laletin hits, and if Dzeranov stops him here with his pronator having, and like making his Laletin's wrist like flat, and then I think there is a possibility him to beat him. Like I won't be surprised if Dzeranov beats Laletin. But on the paper, because of that deadly start, I think that Laletin looks favored as much as we know. But I was thinking that Rewaz would flash
Engin Terzi: This, I don't know, at least in the first two rounds, but he just ready goes, boom, he directly hook him and beat him. Boom, a couple of him and beat him. So I'm not sure about that anymore. How do you see this match? Yeah, well, I think it's very, you know, it's so deceiving, right? Because Georgii, the shutoff has to be
Travis Bagent: biggest rising star in the sport of arm wrestling when it comes to we don't have any like he's the guy in the super heavyweights that we don't know right because we're like oh man you know he down 2-0 against my guy sergey then he somehow you know he brings him back right he hooks him wins three then you're thinking because of um of
Travis Bagent: Come on, man. Why can't I think of the guy that beat me? Sergei... Kalashenko. Yeah, Kalashenko, right. Because of Kalashenko's ability with Georgii to take his hand the first couple rounds, listen, Rivas is going to kill him, right? He's going to kill him. Yeah, yeah, but just remember, remember, Dzeranov just get off the couch. Of course. Two, three months training after a long break, and then Dzeranov, they pull Sergei.
Engin Terzi: And these, I don't know, today are- Well, exactly. Well, that's what we- That has to happen, right?
Travis Bagent: that he also improved a lot, but he comes off the couch, he gets his hand taken twice. He ends up winning three. Oh, so he doesn't take his huge job. He just takes a jump. Then he gets to Revis and we're thinking this is probably the end of the road, right? But no, this massive improvement has taken place, right? Boom. Now you got Devon's fan. He thinks that Georgii's got a chance to be the champ one day because he
Travis Bagent: He just got off the couch, found a way to beat Sergey, kills Rivas, and now we're here. And listen, I don't care how he has to be really good. He has to have gotten better to beat Vitalii, right? But here's the problem. This Vitalii that we know now, this is the number one contender in the world to beat Devon.
Travis Bagent: This guy. But why? What makes you say that? Because he's bigger, he's stronger, he's more confident, he's more explosive. He's everything. He killed Morozov. For me, Artur Morozov is a hero, a freak. That wasn't even close. This Vitalii Lelitin, listen, he needs, as soon as he cracks Georgii Dessert off, which he's going to,
Travis Bagent: 3-0, this is light work for this guy. Not because Georgii is not jumping. It's because Vitalii's ready. Listen, this Vitalii is not the guy that lost to LeVon six years ago in that eighth, the skinny guy. He's not even the guy that allowed, you know,
Travis Bagent: the conflict over there started and all of a sudden he's got a match with Dave and Dave does some crazy... No, no, okay. But a year ago, Hermes won against him. Yeah, but did you see how? I mean... No, I know, I know. It was a hard match. I know it's a hard match. A hard match that Hermes does not want to see again.
Travis Bagent: That's it. Listen, here is the deal. Vitalii's going to crush him, and then he's going to look in the microphone, and he's the guy that deserves the title match after LeVon and Jerry. It's Vitalii. He's the guy. Listen, listen. Like, if Ermes says that I beat Vitalii and I'm ready, then this is it.
Engin Terzi: No problem. We got plenty of them. Listen, I will tell you something. Vitalii and Levan are going to pull eventually if Vitalii is as good as you are saying. It means that he will stay undefeated. If somebody beats Vitalii, it just means that he will not deserve it. Do you have a pen? Do you have a pen right now? Pen, yeah. Yeah, write the date down, and I'll tell you Vitalii Levan is the next super heavyweight champion.
Engin Terzi: Okay. And another thing is that I think Morozov and Laletin will be the next super heavyweight left arm world title match. Yeah. And listen, Fatali, listen, there's a good chance that Fatali is the left and the right-handed champion of the world. Okay. Let's go. Let's go to the next one.
Engin Terzi: Irakli Zirakashvili versus Gyorgy Tautiev. Do you know who Gyorgy Tautiev is? I do not. I do not. He is almost as tall as Vitalii Laletin. He's two meters. You know, he's probably maybe one and a half, two inches taller than Devon. And one of the best top rollers in the world, but he's pulling 209.
Engin Terzi: He has beaten one round. He has beaten Ibragim Sagov. He top rolled him and beat him after a long match. And then in the final, they had the match and Ibragim beat him with dead wrist. But he's a very tall guy. So this guy handled the shoulder pressure of Ibragim Sagov with dead wrist. So in the case, if somehow he takes the wrist of Irakli,
Engin Terzi: Irakli may not have the horsepower to finish him that way. He may, but he may not. We don't know yet. The guy is very tall. I believe that Irakli needs to dominate him. And there is a possibility that he can do that because he's very strong. But the other guy technically may not be comfortable for Irakli. And we know that the matches Irakli lost were against the top rollers. John took his wrist.
Engin Terzi: Of course, he didn't win at the end, but Ongarber did. Tat went sideways, but I saw at the end, some rounds he also lost his wrist. And Dadikyan beat him with outside and side pressure on outside. But Irakli claims that right now his wrist is in a different level. He says that Engin, you will see, I will dominate him. And he says that after that, I will go back to 105.
Engin Terzi: and take care of my losses, you understand? It probably means that he's going to beat this guy, that guy. But I think after this match, most likely his first match will be if he wins, sorry, if he wins, that Tata Sings. But he needs to win.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Todd Hutchings needs the, he needs the title shot, man. What are we waiting on? No, no, he will have it. He already had a title shot against Ongarbe. He won the title, and then he played against Adekani, and he lost his title. What about Adekani? That's another one, too, man. Listen, be very careful. No good?
Engin Terzi: No, no, no. Then he will go down. I meant like down, you know. Yeah, I'm like, oh my goodness. When's Dada Khan? Oh, listen. Dada Khan is injured, but now he started training. He just sent me a message. Listen, how aggressive do you think that person will be the next time that he walks on that stage? Who? Dada Khan.
Travis Bagent: He will be aggressive. He will be very hungry. Are you kidding me? Yeah, he's a killer, too. He's the closest thing to me, to Bat-Killy. Just two guys that you don't mess with, man. You don't mess with them two dudes. But Bat-Killy looks passive-aggressive. He doesn't even talk. Everyone keeps asking about Jerry. Jerry. Yeah, Jerry will be my guest tomorrow. Jerry will be my guest tomorrow. And I think
Travis Bagent: Devon will be my guest tomorrow. And yeah, anyway, so let's go. So who's winning, Irakli or Georgii? I mean, listen, I think that Irakli is on it. I mean, what's Irakli's last five matches? He's on a bender, right? He's doing really, like, he looks amazing, right? He won all the 95-kilo matches. Yeah, yeah. His last loss was to Todd Hutchings, right?
Engin Terzi: I mean, no, no, his last loss wasn't to Tata Cings. That match was in 95, it was 105 kilo. But in 105, he lost to Tad, he lost to Ongarbev, he lost to Dadikyan. And then he came down to 95, and then he beat Rustam, he beat Sasho, and then... Who did he beat last? I think it was Sasho, his last match.
Travis Bagent: It wasn't really close, really, right? No, no, no. Yeah, to me, Irakli is one of those prime examples of... Oh, he beat out Pauline, yeah. Yes, yes, exactly. To me, Irakli's one of them guys, too, that you can gather your information from something that happened a year and a half ago against a superstar, and then the effects of it, to me, all Irakli's done is just grinded, and he's gotten way better.
Travis Bagent: People in chat reminded the last win he was in 105 category, not 95, but he beat Prudnik. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that he's on a super upward momentum too, you know, not probably as drastic as Vitalii, but definitely a problem. I mean, the guy that he's been presenting himself has been pretty amazing. You can only beat the guys that are in front of you in the last three or four times. He's been super impressive. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: By the way, I have terrible jet lag. I went to South Korea, and there until now, today I went to bed 2 p.m., and I get up 5 p.m., three hours sleep. I couldn't sleep at night. It's just, like, terrible, you know? I have to do three podcasts today, three. Yeah. That's why you make all the money, baby. Yes.
Engin Terzi: Anyways, oh, that event is just incredible. This is my favorite match. I think this is the best match of the event. Michael Todd versus Genadi Kvikvinia. You know what? Like, listen, people always make fun with Michael about, oh, like Michael 209 or 2.0, whatever, you know. Anyways, sorry, I'm kind of tired.
Engin Terzi: But Michael that I see right now, physically and spiritually and mentally, I think this is one of the strongest Michael. Seriously, did you see those photos with the shoulders and everything? Even with the left shoulder, like the size of my head, you know, that look incredible. But whenever you see Michael like that, it's hard to bet against him.
Travis Bagent: And then whenever you think that his opponent is Genadi Kvikvinia, then you are saying, uh, never know. It's going to be amazing, man. This is going to be good, man. But I'm with you somehow that Michael Todd has convinced me that he is that guy. He is that guy right now. And we already know
Travis Bagent: It's going to be close anyway. Like, Michael Todd is amazing, right? He is going to stop Genadi. He's going to force Genadi to pull in some crazy ways, which unfortunately for Michael Todd, there is no weaknesses if Genadi is 100%. He has the ability to do all phases. But listen, call me a sappy American.
Engin Terzi: I don't know what to tell you. I am telling you that Michael Todd is another guy that has somehow convinced me he's got a chance at that 153-pound belt. 253, you mean? Yes, 253. One second, one second, my friend. Michael right now looks like over 300 pounds. No doubt, no doubt. He's looking for something else. So you mean for the future?
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I think that, listen, Michael Todd thinks he's going to win the super heavyweight belt. And listen, if Michael Todd can get to the most supreme level, let's be honest with ourselves. He has the technique that would make you question whether LeVon can handle that for four rounds or not. But it has to be a...
Travis Bagent: A better version of the one that stops and it's so difficult because LeVon is so amazing. But Michael Todd, he thinks he's that guy. My opinion is that he's in the top three or four if he's at his best. But at 253, which is a small commitment for him, you can't hear me or I can't hear you.
Travis Bagent: i can't hear you i can't hear you at all that's crazy i wonder if the people i can hear travis but i can't hearing and well that's most the most important thing is they can hear me this is perfect so i think michael todd is the guy is the guy
Travis Bagent: right i don't think he's the guy at the super heavyweight i think he's i think he can cause a problem for the super heavyweight can you hear me now say something and say anything
Travis Bagent: I guess he ain't going to. All right, well, I'm going to keep talking then. The people say they can hear me. I think Michael Todd is going to win the match. I don't know how he's going to win it. It's going to be almost impossible to beat Genadi, but maybe it's just my American blood, but I 100% am pulling for monster Michael Todd.
Travis Bagent: i told engen now listen now that he can't interrupt me ladies and gentlemen let's be honest we should have started from the top and worked ourselves to the bottom right he's connecting reconnecting benji mac i should just keep talking right i don't think now i'm from
Travis Bagent: It ruins it for me.
