Malin: Just going to check. You can ask that question. So we're waiting. Waiting. For live. So hi, everyone, welcome to the East versus West podcast.
Malin: We have the Carolina Pettersson and Dimitrina Petrova that will have a world title match. Best out of seven matches in minus 60 kilos. How are you girls? Fine, very good. Thank you. Good. I couldn't hear Dimitrina. I don't know if the sound is... Oops.
Carolina Pettersson: Good. Perfect. We were talking before we were live about the weather in Sweden. If it's cold. It's perfect for preparations. You know, when it's like hot outside, you get so tired and you don't eat and everything. So this is like good preparation weather. How's the weather in Bulgaria? The same. Same.
Malin: Perfect for preparation all year. No, no, no. You have these like summers where you can't train. You will have to rest, then go to the beach and stuff, right? No beach this year. Only training. Yes. So do you have somebody special? Oh, we have Fia Rejsek here too. And Krasi will be the translator of Dimitrina when she needs it. She's good.
Malin: In English, we know this. I'm Karu's translator too. If that will be needed, I will translate. Have you two ever met at a competition? Yes. Yes. Lost your world championships, WEF. Dimitrina, do you want to answer how it went?
Carolina Pettersson: no caro maybe caro needs to take her excuses okay my excuses was uh actually not any excuses but um it was like two years into my comeback to arm wrestling so
Carolina Pettersson: think that i might be better now but it was definitely like that day dimitrina was definitely better she said it was my first year after my comeback so okay but wait wait wait wait how long was your your break uh two years
Malin: Two years. Mine was nine years. Okay, you win. Yeah, so how did that match go? Did you meet both in the tournament and in the finals or did you just meet once? Once. And how did the match go? Was it hard or was it easy?
Carolina Pettersson: qualification was hard for me but the final i was better and i agree uh from my experience or from my like perception of it uh dimitrina had to work a bit to get to her position um so she had to work with some rowing and like
Carolina Pettersson: getting inside properly and that was probably a bit harder for her in the qualification and then in the in the final she she did a better work but i also think that i did like the wrong adjustments to the final so maybe learning moment for me have you used that experience now when you have been a training uh yes um a bit like also
Carolina Pettersson: uh i have changed a lot in my training and i took help from janice when the match was set because previously i have been like training uh not so specific for arm wrestling just like very much general training like squats and deadlifts and um and the weightlifting and power yeah stuff like that and then some curves and you know and
Carolina Pettersson: But now I changed it completely. And yeah, of course, I have thought about like mistakes that I did or not mistakes, but other ways to adjust. How strong, Dimitrina, do you think Karu can get this past year that have went that she have been training, especially for you?
Carolina Pettersson: how do you how strong how much stronger or better do you think she is now i have no idea do you think you can get like how much better do you think that you can depends if she's still clean or not if i'm still at the world she's clean i mean popping free if she is still clean
Malin: The improvement cannot be so significant. I will tell you something about doping in Sweden. We get tested on our practices. On every competition that we go to, the doping, we are very against doping in Sweden. I don't think any girls ever have been caught in doping. And we have been in the sport for so long. That's great.
Carolina Pettersson: I don't think we have had a professional guy either testing positive. That's the issue. No, I'm just kidding. It should be like this in every country, actually. Yes. And even East versus West should be a doping test event. I agree. Yeah. But do you think that, like, if I started using, you would probably... I think it would, like... You could tell.
Carolina Pettersson: I don't know. It depends if you stay in the same category. I don't know. I have a question. It's very controlled in Sweden and also on a cultural level. We don't accept it. I think also because in Sweden you don't win anything. If you win the world or if you win the Europeans, you don't get anything.
Malin: Nobody's standing on our streets and like giving us houses or money. We pay everything on our own. So yeah. And we consider it really cheating. So I would be very disappointed at anyone in Sweden or everywhere, of course, but especially Sweden, if they got caught with doping, because we are very much against it. And also back in the day, it was us women who
Malin: who made us come into the sports federation in Sweden, just because we wanted to be tested for doping. So how is it in Bulgaria? Is it different to Sweden? It's different. The most important difference is that here in Bulgaria, we get money from the government when we win Europeans and world.
Krasi (translator for Dimitrina Petrova): That makes a huge difference for us. Because if you live in a small town like we do, you can live from this money. Yeah. If you live in the capital, this money will not be enough. But if you live in a small town and you're Europe and world champion every year, you can live from this. That's nice. And about the doping.
Carolina Pettersson: there are some people that are using it not that much maybe 10 15 of the people but most of the people are also against it yeah but there are some people who are using it yeah so getting stronger and so on i heard a rumor that dimitrina has gotten better to get into the hook position
Carolina Pettersson: didn't understand the question um i heard like someone came to me and said to me you know what i have heard that dimitrina is better now to get into the hook position than she was before like she improved that a lot is that something maybe it's better than what was the championship maybe a little bit better but
Krasi (translator for Dimitrina Petrova): okay okay so it's not true good maybe it cannot be a huge difference because she is clean as well so there should yes she is doing this for so many years that maybe there is improvement but it's maybe two three percent five percent maximum but my wrist is better yes her wrist is a little bit better
Krasi (translator for Dimitrina Petrova): How have you trained your wrist to get stronger? She is doing 95% of the time table time. And from time to time, let's say twice in the week, she tries on the pulley how much she can press. And she tries sometimes with the wrist, with the handle for the wrist, how much pillow she can lift.
Carolina Pettersson: She also does those holes. Do you do them, Dimitrina? The one-arm holes? What I do? No, no, what she does. She does something similar. She does something similar, yes. Karol, when you went to the World Championships,
Carolina Pettersson: you uh went up to minus 65 kilos was that because dimitrina was in minus 60 kilos yeah we we heard somewhere uh we don't know if it was voice of arm wrestling or somewhere they said that you did it on purpose to avoid dimitrina uh yeah was it so to save yourself for this match or how did you
Carolina Pettersson: Yeah, because I know Janice and Ray talked about it in their YouTube video. And they speculated that maybe Carolina didn't want to film Dimitrina. And actually, we were three girls from Sweden who normally go to 60 kilo category.
Carolina Pettersson: So it was like, oh, someone has to go into 65. And I saw pros and cons with going into 65. And one of the pros was then I don't have to pull Dimitrina at WAF. And I think that she is.
Carolina Pettersson: the toughest opponent on the right arm under 65 kilo that is like no question i i think that you you are the toughest one to meet so but i also think like in 65 i didn't know that santa wouldn't be there rebecca martin kovikova didn't go but still we had like oksana pismenkaya
Carolina Pettersson: who won last year, and we had Akmaral, who is always taking medals, and Esmanur, other girls, so it's not like... I think there are many good names on right arm, but there is... Dimitrina is still another level.
Carolina Pettersson: So I was like, I can go in 65. It can feel good also because then you take away a bit of pressure and you just go like, you can hit upwards, you know, like I will do in this match. Like you are a bit underdog, a bit lighter, so.
Carolina Pettersson: You don't have the same pressure and also we don't have this like that we get any money for it. So it doesn't matter in that way. I was just like, I will. I tried it Europeans. It went well and I figured I. I could do it for the world's also. So.
Carolina Pettersson: It was one of the reasons that I went to 65, but I could have gone to 60 also. If we were only two girls who wanted to go there, I would have been in 60. So if you have went to 60 kilos at the Worlds and you lost against Dimitrina in the final, how would that affect this opportunity to have this question about a super fight?
Carolina Pettersson: like months i i don't think maybe we wouldn't have a super fight if we already met like one month ago right or two months ago right if it wasn't super if it was it depends if it was a tight fight then probably it would still be a set match or what do you guys think so anyway i think this is much more interesting to do it that you have left the
Carolina Pettersson: the question open for a whole year and improved and you have not felt each other for so long and I think it makes this much more interesting. Dimitrina, what do you think about having Karo in this fight? Will it be a tougher challenge than Ayane or how do you think?
Krasi (translator for Dimitrina Petrova): Be honest. She says that Ayane's style of pulling is very hard for Dimitrina. She attacks exactly where Dimitrina is not that strong and she hopes that this match will be easier for her. I think that Dimitrina is like a bad fit for me.
Krasi (translator for Dimitrina Petrova): But were you surprised that Ayane could beat you on inside as well? Because she did, right? One match? The thing is that we wanted the straps. Because even though the match was semi-hooked, still Ayane was putting too much pressure on Dimitrina's wrist. And if Ayane did that in the straps, then...
Krasi (translator for Dimitrina Petrova): could mean a lot more, but out of the straps, me and Dimitrina were still wondering what would happen if the straps were applied. So we cannot say actually how strong Kayane was on the side because she was very strong to the side, her side pressure was super strong. We were wondering what would happen with the straps. Dimitrina, do you think that you are the favorite
Malin: favorite in this match like carol said that she felt like the underdog yes maybe and how does that sorry she feels the favorite but she never underestimates anyone but do you like to be the favorite no no
Carolina Pettersson: Yeah, me too. Fia, what do you think about this match? It's so hard to predict yet because it's like, like I said, it's so interesting because Caro have not let Dimitrina feel her, her improvement.
Carolina Pettersson: for so long and also I think Caro was hurt not long ago before they met one year ago she and also that affecting her performance then
Carolina Pettersson: um and um so i i i'm i'm super excited i'm i'm always saying that in every match but this will be very interesting and also because i know how much this means for karu to to get this match she had been waiting for this for for so long after she healed up and are you together
Malin: Do you train together? We? No one. Yes, all of you. Are you training sometimes together? Yes, sometimes. Sometimes. We live in different parts of Sweden. So I live in Stockholm. I don't know where Karin lives. I don't remember.
Malin: She never invites me to her house. She has been in my house so many times. No, but sometimes we do. And we went to Riga together. Was it three weeks ago or four? Yeah. So that happens. And can you say that Caro has improved?
Malin: It has improved, I know this, but the funny part was we were going to Riga because Caro was going to have this match with you and we were discussing where should we meet up. We can meet up somewhere in Sweden and then we were like okay we can go to Riga and we can train her, but I didn't touch her, I didn't arm wrestle her at all.
Malin: But I know that Karu has become a lot stronger. I can see the improvement from one year ago until now. How do you see this? I can see that she has Instagram photos. No.
Malin: But in her strength and how she pulls, I think that she is more secure now and she... I don't know, she has more control when she's pulling, I think. We have a question here from the chat. So question for both. Hi, Edvin. Do they think the Supermatch format favours themselves
Malin: or their opponent most? Did you understand the question?
Krasi (translator for Dimitrina Petrova): Dimitrina is not sure actually if it's better or not. She believes that she may have more endurance, but she is not sure if the supermatch is better or not, or if the tournament is better.
Carolina Pettersson: i think that i may have more endurance i think it favors me and also like if if i am a bit underdog like um there will be time to learn and make adjustments and that could be in my favor also how often do you go on the table
Carolina Pettersson: uh once every second week dimitra is pulling three four hours a day okay that could have an effect on her endurance but did she ever have a one hour long super match if she ever had one
Carolina Pettersson: A one hour long supermatch, one hour, lasting for one hour. So do you pull, like if you pull, you don't pull like fast sets and then rest, you pull like endurance for endurance? No, not actually. Most of the time she pulls to gain strength. She pulls with the junior boys.
Malin: and they let her pull and they stopped Lori Beater. How is your training? When you practice arm wrestling, Carolina, how does it look in Sweden? Is it well organized? I think mostly it's not, but the place where I practice in
Carolina Pettersson: um it's a it's a club here uh they are called sif and they are very like they are nerds you know yeah armwrestling nerds so they watched every video that classy has put on youtube every video that janice has put every travis like everybody and they are just
None: So they have a lot of knowledge from watching their videos. So they will be like, okay, the Bulgarians, they trade like this. You have to do like that. And Dimitrina, she trades like this. So they are super helpful. And you are listening to them?
Malin: Of course! You're listening to... I love SIP. If you're watching this, I love you guys, but... So you're saying that there is a bunch of nerds where you live and they have watched a lot of videos, so therefore... 6,000... No, yeah, 6,000 hours of Travis. That's what they have watched. Yeah. Oh, so continue. We will see.
Malin: We will see if that works out. Have you seen, like, now when armwrestling is so mainstream and now when East vs. West has grown so big, have you noticed anything, Dimitrina, that armwrestling is growing in Bulgaria from this, from YouTube and watching all these videos?
Krasi (translator for Dimitrina Petrova): Maybe we see some growth. Just right now in Bulgaria, we have two federations and we cannot see so many competitors in each class, but we can see some growth. Actually, I can say that about 20 years ago,
Krasi (translator for Dimitrina Petrova): armwrestling in bulgaria was more popular because we had professional armwrestling league back then in bulgaria there were eight eight rounds in the year and best eight competitors in bulgaria were pulling there left and right everybody versus everybody and back then the winner for first place
Krasi (translator for Dimitrina Petrova): The first year, Miroslav Ivan took a car. The prize money at the end of the year was car. After that, for the next three or five years, the winner was taking a piece of gold, pure gold. Yes, and there were a lot of money in that competition. And they were showing this on the TV. Almost every day, they were showing on our sports channel, Rino.
Krasi (translator for Dimitrina Petrova): they were showing armwrestling and back then armwrestling was more popular in Bulgaria. Than it is now? Yes, yes, yes. Wow. Yes, because everybody is watching TV, not everyone is watching armwrestling videos on YouTube, but everyone is watching TV and maybe right now there are more competitors, but
Malin: example if i walk on the street and back then there were more people recognizing me than now oh yes yeah okay that's a bit sad yeah that's that's a bit sad but um in the rest of the world you're more known now for the nerds you're super well known
Malin: Caro, I have you and Tia. Do you see anything that the sport has grown from social media now and from East versus West in Sweden? Very much, I would say. I had this young boy that started
Carolina Pettersson: like last Thursday so he just came to the club this one time and he wanted to try on wrestling and then I just said to him that he was very shy didn't say much so after the practice on Sundays we will do like a
Carolina Pettersson: a different type of training here we will do like arm wrestling specific strength training and he was like i already do he was like 11 years old and he said i already do that three times a week i've been watching youtube i have all these handles everything
Carolina Pettersson: and so it was his first time trying arm wrestling on the table but he already knew like everybody all the ways to train at home everything and it's
Carolina Pettersson: it's like also different now is that people are not asking anymore like oh arm wrestling can you compete in that is that a real sport it's like now now they know that this is arm wrestling generally they are like oh i have seen devon on youtube that's what they will say but also i also met this mostly guys who are like okay i've been watching arm wrestling on youtube for two years and now i decided
Malin: that I want to try it out, so it's good. Let's hope someday we reach the Olympics. Yes, let's hope. But I think right now we are split in IFA and WAF too. I think we should just come together and be great again. Of course. Dimitrina, what do you think about
Malin: the other women's match, Brigitta and Irina Gladkaya? I have no idea. I didn't see Gladkaya for a long time in the competition. I don't have idea how strong she is. What do you think, Karu?
Carolina Pettersson: I think because I pulled Brigitta once in Swiss Open and on the right arm and I won.
Carolina Pettersson: Uh, I think maybe like, I, I don't think, uh, still looks like she's in good shape, like explosive. You can see her pull in Russia and it looks like she, I don't, I don't know, just like by watching, like she, she, um, still has pretty good power. Uh, so I think maybe she will actually take the win, but I don't know. Yeah. I talked to them the other day, um, and, um,
Malin: And we were talking about the match where you won, Carolina. And she said that she was not mentally focused. And also that it was very late in the evening. It was late for everyone, right? Because your competition was until three o'clock in the morning. But she is struggling with being in the zone when she goes up on the table. You two,
Malin: doesn't seem like your mental strength needs to be improved. When you two go up on, when I can see you on, when you're competing, you look so confident, both of you. Is that true? Yeah, mostly for me, at least. It's very deterministic, like you have trained
Carolina Pettersson: have done everything that you can do and if you're the best you will win if you're not the best you will lose probably so that's how i feel but i feel like dimitrina you are a bit you look sometimes like a bit unbothered like um you're not very expressive expressive yes she's worried but inside she doesn't show it
Malin: poker face smart but dimitrina do you ever get too nervous when you go up or when you go up are you always feeling that you can do the best even when when she is nervous most of the people in the crowd do not understand
Carolina Pettersson: That's a good thing. Who do you consider, like if not Ayane, who do you consider to be like your toughest opponent that you have? If, if, yeah. I think Esra. Esra? Yes. Yes, because she beat you inside, right? And you had to. Yes. That's true. And then she was 60, right?
Malin: And also she's a bit shorter, so maybe you can. But she's very strong. It's not a problem.
Malin: And what about your left? When will you start pulling left? What? Maybe never. Maybe never. I have a question here. Ladies, what are your thoughts on the new Queen of the Table promotion? I didn't hear anything about it. We also don't know what it is.
Malin: Now you know. Who said that? Todd and Oleg's love child. Anyway, yeah. But you haven't heard anything about the queen of the table? No. Instead of king of the table.
Malin: So tell us what you can tell us about it. I can't tell any. I just heard that there will be, for me, what I know about it, it's that they will also have queen of the table, the same as they have a king of the table. So it will be matches with the women on the same tournament. That sounds good.
Malin: If they do, it will be amazing. Yeah, so... Good. Dimitrina, what do you think that Kavra has for weaknesses? What is her weaknesses? Zero. A side pressure, maybe? I hope side pressure.
Malin: You hope. Dimitrina hopes Caro lacks side pressure. You can say this now because it's only like one week before you go so she can train more side pressure now. What do you say, Caro? I think that side pressure might not be
Carolina Pettersson: my strongest move, but I have improved a lot in like different techniques like the past year. I have learned to use different movements and like apply them on table. So at least that is something. Karu, what do you weigh right now? I think like 61.
Carolina Pettersson: yeah um and what do you weigh to medina 60 60.5 60 61. okay so you also generally uh you're above 60 like off season yes but not not like 62 63 you stay around 61.
Carolina Pettersson: Okay. So Carolina, what do you think about Dimitrina's weaknesses? I mean, like the thing is that she is, she is great. Like when she gets to her,
Carolina Pettersson: her position she is great sideways and she can also pull top roll i wouldn't say like she has a weakness and i agree with their previous statement like that ajana like she did who without strap sideways and she got through uh she enabled
Carolina Pettersson: you to get into your side position that you prefer and like i don't think i can do what she did so i have to uh think of other ways that's what i can say yeah we have a one question here too from uh from sergey uh sorry for the pronunciation
Carolina Pettersson: Can you ask Carolina if she has any less power at 60 kilos? But you didn't weigh that much over 60, do you? I weighed like 63. About 63 is my top weight. But when I weighed in for Europeans and the World Championships, I weighed like 62 point something with clothing on. But I don't know because I never... The only time I...
Carolina Pettersson: I gained this weight during the previous year. So the only time I went down was for the match, my previous East vs West match with Oleg Terpelová. And since I don't know much about her shape right now and so on, I can't tell if I got weaker. It's hard to say, but I hope not. And I think like a few kilos shouldn't make a difference. Yeah.
Carolina Pettersson: Do you have any questions to each other? I already asked like something. Nothing else right now. Maybe like if there are other matches that you are excited about on the card. Like just general.
Carolina Pettersson: Like, do you have any match that you look forward to at the card? You're asking Dimitrina? Yes. Or anyone who wants to mention. She says that there are many great matches for her.
Malin: yeah i especially this is my favorite match of the day of course for me it's uh i i can compare with you girls which i can't with the men so for me it's more interesting with the female matches uh it will be fun with irina and and ivanfi um it will just be fun to watch them but
Malin: But I think this match will be more intense. And also, you don't know how this match will end. And you two are really great arm wrestlers. You are good at arm wrestling. It's fun to watch you arm wrestle. It's not like going out like this. You can arm wrestle. So that will be...
Carolina Pettersson: What if we go like this then? We will have to... Be ashamed of yourself! But Malin, which is your favourite match of the men's? Like, on the rest of the card. I don't have a favourite one. Which one is yours?
Carolina Pettersson: Oh, there are like several, I'm looking forward to like, um, um, Ivan Matyushenko and Alizhan, like that is major match. Uh, I think it will be fun to see, uh, Danil Ustinov because you know, he's like big, uh, on Instagram and also like, uh, winning titles and so on. So it will be fun to see him pulled in East versus West. Um,
Carolina Pettersson: Looking forward to also seeing Betkili and Oleg Shok. I think that one is like really interesting. And if Betkili can win, it will be like major.
Carolina Pettersson: So those might be like... Those are also my favorites. Why did you pick my favorites? And like, it's also fun to see these like Turkish guys. I don't know them so well. The one who's pulling Makarov and like, because I don't, I don't have like,
Carolina Pettersson: history record of them or something so it will be fun to see where they're at do you know the order of the matches have you heard what what order you have now i think it might be the same as like how they presented the card or what do you guys think so we will be like a fifth match or something i think so we were saying the last stages
Malin: Okay. Yeah. So I'm just going to check the chat. I can't see any questions. Maybe somebody I have bad eyes to. Is there anything else that anybody will what I have a question? A good question. This is very interesting.
Carolina Pettersson: especially for this match. Me and Fia will have a match in February. What do you think about that match? Left arm. No, right arm. Then Malin will lose. She sucks on her left. I'm kidding, she's good. Okay, Dimitrina and Krasi. Krasi, you can start. Or Dimitrina can start.
Carolina Pettersson: I don't know what to say actually. Do you know how good Malin is? Because she has been not pulling a lot of international tournaments lately. They don't know as much as I don't know about the men's.
Carolina Pettersson: From what I have seen, I believe that Malin has the edge out of the straps. With the straps, maybe Fia has the edge. I am not sure. That's a good observation. I think that Fia also, like the past year, you reached
Carolina Pettersson: uh another level you're like constantly reaching new levels even how long you're in the sport but um but i i think that molly might be like she's heavier also what weight uh limit will you have minus 80 yeah 80 okay okay and i wait right now i think grass is onto something like
Carolina Pettersson: I think so too. Anyway, do you have any more questions to each other or Fia? Otherwise, I think we can wrap this up. We can wrap it up. Thank you, girls. I wish I could be there and see you live. But unfortunately, I can't. I have to sit home and watch. But good luck to you.
Malin: and i hope it will be a war yeah and i will be there with you so it will be awesome to see it live thank you everyone thank you for being on the show it was great talking to you and thank you everybody who has been watching see you soon see you soon
