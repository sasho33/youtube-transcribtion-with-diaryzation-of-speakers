Unknown Host: Hello, guys. Sorry about it.
Unknown Host: yes yes yes sorry guys sorry um i just sent the link to um i'm just saying to link to travis and and waiting for him to join sorry yeah i don't know what's happening with this youtube thing travis i send you the link can you join please
Unknown Host: and this doesn't happen usually it doesn't happen but this time it just happened you know sorry guys there is nothing i can do it but this when i had the zoom type of the connection i don't have this but when you have the youtube um direct calls you know then
Unknown Host: There is a problem. So unless we have like two matches left, I think, and then let's finish them yesterday. I was just came. Sorry, Travis. What kind of unprofessional shit is this? Come on. I was killing it. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: Sorry about it. Okay, we were talking about, okay, Genadi versus Michael, and you were saying that Michael is going to win. Michael's going to win. It's going to be amazing. These two guys, they don't get no better than these two guys. These got to be the two best promoters that you could ever put up against each other. Yeah. It's going to be a lot of trash talk. Genadi's energy is going to be crazy. He's going to try to bully Michael Todd a little bit.
Unknown Host: I don't think this is the Michael Todd you can bully. I think he's big and strong. He's confident. He's poised. Is your volume down? Can you increase your volume or something is again wrong? I don't know. I'm all the way up kid. I am. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So you are saying that, yeah. Did you see today, like Michael did something not today, but yesterday, I think something that he normally doesn't do.
Unknown Host: I think Genadi, he said, Genadi, you have 17 days left to think if you have done enough. And then right after that, Genadi shared, Opana, Opana, I will destroy you, Michael Klotz. What does Opana mean? What does that mean? I have no idea. I have no idea, but I think this is,
Unknown Host: Like, it is a little personal for Michael when I say personal, not in a toxic way, but there is a rematch. Genadi beat him. Yeah. Yeah, Genadi beat him earlier. And now they're going to fight again. Yeah, yeah. But most likely, I mean, I can say that Genadi had the control. I don't think that Genadi was in danger of losing in that match. And
Unknown Host: It was the second match after Genadi's return from a serious injury. And now after that, Genadi gets better and better and better and better. But now he also, again, coming back from an injury. And this is the first match. And I don't know. I don't know. What was the injury? Do you know what the injury was?
Unknown Host: Oh, his bicep was torn, like same as Michael's. They both had surgery. But the difference is that Michael had three super matches after his comeback. He pulled against Lamparelli, he pulled against Lars, he pulled against Kamil. So this is his fourth match after coming back. But for Genadi, this is the first match. So where can his confidence be after such an injury? But it has been 15 months. But if anybody...
Unknown Host: can come fully ready mentally after such an injury, that is for sure. That guy, and maybe I shouldn't say what psychopath, you know, the guy is, yeah. Yeah, and listen, there's also too, like, you know, I mean,
Travis Bagent: really strange about these matches because you know Genadi could also have way bigger aspirations than what he feels the level of Michael Todd is so if Genadi is really wants to be in that picture with Vitalii with Ermias with Catarat of course he is with Catarat I mean that's
Travis Bagent: That match there was legendary. So if he wants to be in that top three, four conversation, he needs to run Michael over. The Michael Todd, though, for some reason, even though, I mean, listen, let's rewind. He wasn't that impressive against Lamparelli. Like, I mean, you can watch that. Yeah, but there was the first match, and he was 115 kilos.
Travis Bagent: Right now, I think he is 130 kilo or 35 kilo. So he's 20 kilo heavier probably. I'm just, my attempt is to just discredit the unbelievable momentum that an American, a Michael Todd fan, if he wants to say that this momentum is so amazing, that's one thing.
Travis Bagent: I am drinking the Kool-Aid. I'm drinking the Michael Todd Kool-Aid. I feel like I have a tremendous respect for Camille Jablonski. I think he's amazing. For Michael to beat him, it's impressive to me, and it shows me that Michael is climbing, he's focused, and he's going to be strong. But if we want to play devil's advocate, we don't, you know, Genadi's like, listen, I love Camille to death. Left-handed, Camille 100%.
Travis Bagent: could be you know the favorite against Genadi but maybe not you know Genadi's left-handed good too but when it comes to right he's top three I think coming up to the top four with left exactly but right-handed we can't put Camille in that category yet of being
Travis Bagent: We can only do it left-handed. So just because if you're Genadi, you may not be that impressed with Michael's win on Camille. You're probably not that impressed with the one with Lars. And if you watch the Lamparilli match, you could go out there gaining some confidence if you're Genadi. So I understand why if you're a Genadi fan, if you're an impartial fan, you could have Genadi 100% the winner.
Unknown Host: I, on the other hand, am a sucker for Michael Todd, the United States of America. So I will be, my energy will be pulling for the monster. Yeah, I'm just thinking that like we're talking about Michael's performance, but we don't know where Genadi is. And the difference between
Unknown Host: In my opinion, Kamil's press like this is incredible, but it is a steady press, constant press, while Genadi can hit you. And the other thing is that Kamil goes directly to the press, while Genadi climbs up, goes far, far, far, far, and then presses.
Travis Bagent: Trying to press Michael here and pressing Michael here are not the same thing. Farther you can press, better chance you have. Yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah. And we also don't know that he won't beat him without pressing. Like there's a chance that he just, cause he had some unbelievable hand control last time against Michael. It was pretty, it was dominant at times. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: You know, so I agree with you. There is a total difference. I'm just wondering, it depends on what side you're on as to how you want to judge the wins that Michael's showing you. So you can either be impressed by the fact that he's active or you can just be under impressed by the level of competition. If you are Genadi who thinks he's, you know, in the top three in the world. Okay. Ivan Matyushenko, Alizhan Muratov.
Unknown Host: Listen, Travis, I will tell you something. Let me talk. Once the world understands arm wrestling as much as you understand, we will be one of the best mainstream sports. Your reaction, once people understand arm wrestling as much as you do and react like this to this match, and then yeah.
Travis Bagent: people people will uh really make arm wrestling to that level yeah that's why it is our responsibility to explain to the public what a beautiful sport think about think about two human beings that you can only draw reference to competition is if you put guys that are bigger than them against them right like these guys are meeting at this weight class
Travis Bagent: in the most perfect, strongest versions of themselves. Both of them are so ridiculously talented. Both of them can have the match go the way they want at the beginning. It is totally okay for Matyushenko to drive this guy.
Travis Bagent: drive him into his chest no he doesn't he will not go that way no listen listen if it did i think that he i think that you're gonna see a lot more of this than normal he listen he's gonna feel some crazy listen he can get to his spot and not win yeah
Travis Bagent: It depends. I think it depends where, how much it is. Like, I don't think, do you think Ali Can can lift him from here? No, no, not there. Not there. Not there. What he needs is for this to get opened a little as it goes down and then
Travis Bagent: But listen, and that's us because we're rooting or we're giving the opinion because we're on Matyushenko's side. Why am I on his side? Because I can see that this always happens. It always happens. He has set up in a way that any pressure that way turns this man inside. He is going there, you imagine.
Travis Bagent: There's a whole nother side of this. The best arm wrestler in the world, he might be arm wrestling. Manaschenko may be arm wrestling the best arm wrestler in the world. Yeah. And he can't do anything with him. Okay. Okay. Okay. Travis, what is the possibility Ali-Chan to just dominate Ivan?
Travis Bagent: Travis. 20, 20%. 20%. 20%. You're going to say that he will do for all and dominate. Okay. What is the possibility that match? The middle of the middle is stacked. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. It's to me, my second has got a 10% chance of dominating. And, but even if he dominates Alijon, the domination is that the map, it would last, you know,
Unknown Host: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the domination from Adesanya. Yeah, yeah, but what I'm just saying that what is the possibility that this match is going to be a war? Or what is the possibility that one will dominate the other one? So you are saying that 20% Alizhan is going to dominate, 10% Ivan is going to dominate, and you are saying 70% there will be a battle. Yes.
Unknown Host: And what do you think about the speed of the athletes? They both look fast, but in my opinion, Alizhan is fast by moving with his whole body, while Ivan has such a strong wrist domination over the pronator. I think Matyushenko took the advantage that he's not even moving. Any movement on either side is forcing this.
Travis Bagent: It doesn't matter. He is already, the palm of his hand is on Alijon's side of the table. And I know this isn't literal. I'm just telling you that when I look at this, the first, there is any movement, any movement creates that. So to me, it's beyond speed. He's done set up in a way that that's how it's happening. This is extraordinary.
Travis Bagent: This match is an extraordinary demonstration of arm wrestling. I'm not sure who's going to win. I also, too, I have to go way back to when Alijon is against Petrenko to see what I feel are possible kinks in Alijon's armor.
Travis Bagent: But that's so long ago. This is a whole different guy that is just so, so crazy, crazy. But there were times in the Petrenko match where you saw a positioning and a little bit of panic in Alizhan's face. I believe that look on his face, the panicky, herky-jerky movements,
Travis Bagent: They have to be a part of him coming back against Manaschenko because Manaschenko is such a technician. I don't ever see him in weird, ever in weird positions. It's just always so beautifully done.
Unknown Host: poised yeah yeah if he loses because of the power difference he loses but you don't really see him out of control like he gets but if he loses because his power is not enough but about positioning he's always like almost always is there he has his control yeah and and and one is the bigger guy he's taller guy bigger structure you know and but we have like just think about it who did
Unknown Host: Ali John beat, till now, that is as left arm specialist as Ivan. Not Hermes. Cody is left arm specialist, but Cody is outside puller. What do you think Ali John's relationship with Morozov? Do they have a friendship? Do they have an acquaintance? Are they training together? I mean, they are from the same country. I'm sure that they are friends, but I don't think they are training together.
Unknown Host: character because that's the information that Al-Azhar has. He has, maybe he knows that if he is with Morozov 50-50, just like we thought. You know that in East versus West, the elbow pad from each side, one centimeter bigger. And then when Matyushenko pulled against Morozov in Dubai, the pads were not as
Unknown Host: biggest East versus West. And he often had like little fouls from the backside though. He has pinned Morozov a few times. I don't know how big was the elbow foul, but like maybe there would be like some different results from that match if the elbow pads were as big as... So close. It was so close. Yeah, it was very close, yeah.
Travis Bagent: I believe that Alex John, he may or may not have that information about how he feels personally in a slow grinding hook match with Morozov. If he has information that says that I'm stronger than Morozov in there, then he's got to feel really confident because to me, the match is going to go there. Yeah. It's gone there. And I don't care who pulls. You better be ready to pull right there. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: The question is, who do you think that, like, which match do you think that deserves to be the main event match? Devon versus Patrick? Listen, from an entertainment standpoint, you can never go wrong with Devon, right? And listen, what we want, and we all have to understand this, right? Some of our arm wrestling, and I think you mentioned it, right? Like, how much show, how much pure arm wrestling, right? But we do understand that Devon has that unique,
Travis Bagent: quality a lot of people are telling me that ivan matushenko versus alejan should be the main event but and every arm wrestling purist and if you have a bunch of information and you're a weirdo like i believe me and you are when it comes to caring and understanding and seeing and and debating and talking and discussing if you're one of those guys then listen you're correct you are right these are the most two talented people in the building
Unknown Host: that are pulling each other. I still may not agree. I still may not agree because we're talking about Devon that won three times the super heavyweight world title, won the heavyweight world title, and now he's going for his third category. And I still think that even as a carrier, I think he's
Travis Bagent: bigger name than the ones that are mentioned. And it's just but we all to write like you have to know that we watch him in chance. And and because of that, we understand that his brand has a lot to do with entertainment and showmanship, too. So, you know,
Travis Bagent: But what you just said, it kind of, that resume, breaking out that resume, that's what Devon has too. So he has both. So you can't go wrong. If anybody, if Matyushenko or Aljan ran the East-First-West, they would make Devon and Petrenko the main event. Okay, I understand. And even Dems has would make, yeah, I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it.
Unknown Host: Like, so colorful, Travis. I tell you what, I am not a fan of many people. As an armwrestler, I think I can say that, like, pure armwrestling, I'm only a fan of John. Of course, I like enjoying the other guys as well. But about this...
Unknown Host: opinions and your your predictions and things i'm fan of yours just just let me uh admit that i enjoy watching you talking about harnessing and another one that i enjoy uh is neil pickup i will be his guest today at uh 4 30 p.m yes but you are you are number one for sure like i love the way you you are not holding anything back either where did you go
Unknown Host: okay we have the last last one we have devon versus petrenko match and let's wait for travis to come back and then i can rest a little bit in a little bit more another one
Unknown Speaker: And I like this.
Unknown Speaker: There's nothing like refresh or something here. I need to either close the live or...
Unknown Speaker: Well, man, listen. We need to get some professionals on here, man. We got to hire harder men. Or somebody. I do these things every day. I don't ever have any trouble.
Travis Bagent: We can't understand.
Unknown Host: All right, we'll do it. You want to do it finished tomorrow on Devon? Oh, you want to join, Mr. Travis? Tomorrow? Yeah, what time are y'all on? Let me check. Let me check. It would be good if you join. Okay, that would be how we would do. Yeah, but it will be very hard because... All right, they say it's fine now. It's all good. It's all good now. They can hear. They can hear. It's all good. All right, let's do it. Devon?
Travis Bagent: Yeah, they're all good. So listen, Devon Petrenko, what Devon said is true, that he's got, that his hand, when he's pulling those lower weight classes, there are going to be problems for those guys. I don't think that Devon's got like the most extraordinary hand in the world. However,
Travis Bagent: The hand that he took up there and pulled with Ernie was pretty awesome. But that was a 300-pound hand. What's this hand? This hand has to be at 231. Oh, man, listen, 50-50, 50-50. And listen, the winner, if it is, in fact, Devon Larratt, it won't be the most – it won't be with a ton of integrity.
Travis Bagent: Right. There will be a lot of turmoil talking, just a lot of bullshit associated with him winning at 231 pounds. He's going to be light, like, like how much did he weigh when he just pulled the, um, the bodybuilder? He just pulled it. Yeah. He just pulled left-handed. Oh.
Travis Bagent: He was probably under 20 kilos, 265 or something. Yeah. He was huge. Like 30 pounds. This is when can Devon weigh in and when will he arm wrestle? What is the time? He will weigh in Friday morning and he will compete Saturday evening. Oh, so interesting, man. And listen, if he gets big enough, he'll kill him. But how much bigger can you get? And Petrenko is amazing.
Travis Bagent: oh it's amazing this is this is 50-50 it's 50-50 yeah and listen also to like
Travis Bagent: I believe that subconsciously as a referee, as an organizer, as an arm wrestling fan, as a commentator, when Devon Laird is arm wrestling, LeVon Shaggin' his Philly, when he's going against, come on, name all the big guys, Denis Chaplankov, when he's arm wrestling super heavyweight arm wrestlers, we embrace,
Travis Bagent: the height difference in the set grip, right? We embrace the banter with him and the referee. We're okay with the false starting. We're gonna see now Devon come down to give the, I mean, when he walks up to Petrenko, he's gonna give the illusion that he's the bigger man. Now, are we still gonna have the same compassion for him?
Travis Bagent: when he is acting the way that he acts at the table, when he is bullying big Georgii Spetkov, we even started getting a little agitated by that. If we see Devon unwilling to compromise against the 231 pound opponent, that now Devon weighs excess of 250 pounds after gaining all the water back,
Travis Bagent: will the referee be a little quicker to give the warning to give the foul so you are you are you saying that devon has been getting away with the advantages he has been taking everything taking yes i mean and i'm not talking yes that is exactly what i am saying is that we when i say we this is
Travis Bagent: Arm wrestling. Arm wrestling is okay with the underdog fighting to even the playing field. We will see how strict the refereeing gets in that set grip because Petrenko cannot allow for Devon to be a half inch higher than him in the webbing. He cannot have Devon turning in the set grip and leaning back and starting the King's move before go.
Unknown Host: Hutchings like that will be a detriment to a guy at 231 pounds. I always tell referees to be fair and apply the rules for everyone. If they are getting intimidated or something, I don't know. But for sure, for me, as you know, when you think about me, seriously,
Unknown Host: In deep in me, do you see a businessman or someone who loves arm wrestling? Oh, not even close. That's why you're so good at business is because it's strictly from the love. Yeah. So for me, the sweat of a puller who is not famous and the sweat of the athlete who is the most famous, no difference. I am here to make sure that
Travis Bagent: everything will be fair and square no matter no matter like what is the results you understand like like i i don't really care if anyone strike off will need he will need there to be some very strict very strict moot uh technical things done in that set grip
Travis Bagent: And he needs to be very careful as to how, and I know it's, you know, you can't stop it. That's what makes Devon so great is that he is a competitor and he's getting after it. I'm just telling Oleg that if I was him,
Travis Bagent: I would remind the ref that we would like the webbing to be equal and I would love it if you would let that man not start his back pressure, even if it's through the back and the lat and the planning, just don't let him start until after you say go. That's what I would do if I was him because once Oleg's hand and wrist is compromised and the match is over in that nine to 11 second range,
Travis Bagent: The writing on the wall is that Devon will continue to bleed out the lighter guy. And we've only seen Devon kind of run into trouble when I believe that Devon has hit a couple of these super heavyweights. He has had them in position.
Travis Bagent: that if he weighed the same as them, that he could have drained them out. But he underestimated the 350-pound Genadi and Devon that just continually will push forward and make it hard. So I don't know. Good question.
Unknown Host: The question, how much difference between super heavyweight Devon and Devon that cuts down to 231? You say that it will be 250 next day, but you cannot tell me that that 15, 20 pounds water cut will not have any effect at all.
Unknown Host: Oh, it will. It has to. I mean, how much? How much? Like, where do you see? Like, where do you see that Devon, unlimited, eating, drinking, coming, no weight cut, and then Devon, they will make $2.31. 30%. 30% down. Like, listen. Are you serious? 30%? No way. You sure? Yeah, listen, if Devon, you could take 30% from Devon and he'll still beat Petrenko.
Travis Bagent: think that's what it is that's what it takes 30 percent listen if devin comes in there at 275 pounds he will kill petrenko he will kill him the fact that he's losing this weight that's where we're and listen that's a big weight loss that's a big big i will tell you something i'm not sure there is there is 30 percent 35 percent difference between
Unknown Host: like Petrenko and Levan. Listen, when you say like 35%. What are you saying, 20%? No, no, what I'm just saying that like, yeah, around that, 20%, yeah. Those guys on the scale is small, but they are not weak. They are like, I don't think they are 30% behind, but maybe 20%. Because those numbers are very big, you know, 1%, 2%.
Unknown Host: will tell you something weightlifting world championships ours is also very explosive sport ready go you know but the guy lives 150 kilo and then he tries to he lifts it and then he goes to 152 and a half kilo which is 1.7 kilo difference sorry 1.7 percent difference and then
Unknown Host: He tries to lift, he goes like, and then he lifts the weight. So he just makes 1.7% difference, and then he can't really move the weight. Yeah, when I say 30%-ing, we're going through three weight classes.
Unknown Host: I'm just saying that. Two weight classes. I mean, in fact, like two weight classes, okay, the weight is a huge difference. I mean, I think that one of the reasons that Levan is so incredible is also because of the hand size. Also, like his hand. And about the power...
Unknown Host: I mean, it's a different thing, you know, like because of his hand is just super advantage. Also strong hand and waist. But just look at the waist that he is lifting and look at the waist that Irakli is lifting. In fact, you know, I mean, the power level is not that big. Yeah, but you have to. So what I'm just saying that the 5% difference is sometimes causing a flash pin. You understand? 5% difference.
Travis Bagent: So the 20%, 30% is just like, I don't know. Yeah, and listen, I could be wrong. It could be 20%, whatever it is. Just know that 231 pounds or the Devon that almost stopped LeVon in round one, there is some sort of equation there of difference. And that difference is what's needed for this match to happen.
Travis Bagent: We need Devon's losing the weight to affect him in order for Petrenko to win. So do you think that you are worried that
Unknown Host: the match will not be fair start. This is what you are saying. I'm not worried about Devon doing anything that he doesn't already do in the past. No, no. But what you are saying, what you are saying that he has taken everything. So if he doesn't take everything, do you see there is a possibility that Petrenko is beating Levan four times? Sorry, sorry, Devon, Devon, four times? 100%. Yes. So Petrenko has a good chance of beating Devon. This is what you are saying.
Unknown Host: When we opened the show, I'm telling you, and I'm not lying, every single time that Devon Lorenzo... Another question. We saw years ago at WL, like, for me, the round one was a pin when Todd Hutchings pulled Devon. I think he came to the pad. And round two. I'd say round one and round two. Yeah, but the round... I don't know. I don't remember round two, but round one, I think it was a pin. And I was discussing with
Unknown Host: and Neil said that Engin but how about later but but remember that that match in my opinion after pin it continued about 30 seconds so I think it took a lot from Todd if the pin was called you understand so do you believe that today's Todd because of he is more developed pronation pronator that press do you think that Todd would have
Travis Bagent: better chance against Devon. Yes, I think it's yes. And do we have a problem now or are we good? Can you hear me? I mean, I hear you, but your picture is crazy. It doesn't. Let me answer the question. The fact is, yes, 100%. Now, Devon's going to help us out a little bit. Devon, in 10 or 11 days, we're going to find out how dominant can Devon be at 231.
Travis Bagent: Because if he kills Petrenko, then I probably don't feel as good as I do. But I believe that Todd has a very good chance of beating Petrenko personally. I think that match is 50-50. So if we see that Devon and Petrenko is close, then I have to assume that that will remain the same when Devon pulls Petrenko.
Travis Bagent: a awesome arachne awesome dotacon and awesome todd hutchings because i believe that that category has five champs i think the very best prudnik could possibly be the best 231 guy now we've given us some evidence that he's not on the top of his game right now so that's why arachne we all know hunger byev in my opinion hunger byev is
Travis Bagent: a uh you know a more dedicated training right and without being without saying the words being more dedicated and merrily could be the champ at 231 too we know dotacon could be the champ and we have no choice but to say the champ is oleg so how this match if he kills him if devin kills him and demonstrates to us that 231 is easy work for him
Unknown Host: If he does that, then first of all, that's crazy impressive. And you can just put Devon as the overall winner because if he kills Petrenko easy, he'll probably do the same to the other five guys. Yeah, the difference is that can Petrenko pull as effective as Todd without his wrist, but like having his pronator. So the reason I mentioned about Todd because Todd lost against
Unknown Host: Dadikyan beat him even in a kind of endurance battle because the match was stopped. Tog brought him to his winning side and Dadikyan was still able to lift him from there and beat him while Petrenko kind of had a dominant win against Dadikyan.
Unknown Host: So from this perspective that you say that Devon may have problems with touchings, so that maybe, like for me, when I imagine Devon, I see a big guy, huge guy, you know what I'm saying? Not a 105 guy. In fact, a guy with the size of super heavyweight while on the scale he looks 231.
Unknown Host: Friday morning. But still, whenever I think about this, how much do you think that Devon at 231, weighing 231, will be stronger than the time that he pulled against Todd Hutchings? Yeah, I think he's better now. I think that Devon is... Better now as a super heavyweight or better even at 231?
Travis Bagent: Just better overall, not because he's any stronger, but I think he's healthier. I believe that the stem cell regimen that he applied has given him a level of health that allows him to get better and he's gotten better and he's amazing. And I believe that at 231,
Travis Bagent: he's 50-50 with the best 231 guys. And I believe at 253, he's 50-50 with the 253 guys. And I believe that he's shown us that he's really close, not 50-50 with LeVon, but damn close, even if he's in the super heavyweight category. Okay, who is the toughest competition for Devon in super heavyweight other than LeVon?
Unknown Host: Vitalii Laletin. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. That's what I was thinking, yeah. And do you think that with a better riser and back pressure at the start, do you think that Hermes will ever have a chance against Devon? I mean, listen.
Travis Bagent: You would like to see what Devon, I didn't know if Devon had, I knew Genadi had it in him to be stronger than Devon in a hook, able to fight him top row wise, not win, but be able to fight there. But having that, you almost have to have that silver bullet where you can push
Travis Bagent: from a Kings move slash neutral position with a compromised hand and wrist. I haven't seen Ermes display that to us yet. And over three or four rounds trying to beat Devon, it seems that you have to have it in your arsenal. And so to me, that's the problem Ermes has.
Travis Bagent: one thing Hermes has gone for him is the Devon he pulled might have been the greatest Devon ever. Like the Devon that pulled Hermes and the one that pulled LeVon, I don't think that Devon is, that requires...
Travis Bagent: certain level of commitment that Devon doesn't have if he's flirting around with pulling at 231 and 253 at times yeah so it's you know all these equations you got all these factors and listen it's also for me it's how do I feel that day do I am I on the Hermes because I think he's amazing because I can give you an argument that Hermes is awesome and then I can also give the argument that
Travis Bagent: that Devon is more awesome, that LaVon's more awesome. But I can also talk for hours about, you know, what could possibly derail LaVon, right?
Travis Bagent: his lack of cardio showing up in that match. And then him being such a, he was as calm as a cucumber when facing that same adversity with Devon in that first round, right? I didn't panic, there was no bad- Do you think that Hermes' preparation at that time was against Jerry and
Unknown Host: Devon match was only four weeks later, so he did not have any specific preparation for Devon. And do you think that he would have a longer time to prepare against a top roller like Devon? Do you think that it would be? Because whenever he was getting ready for Jerry, he was mostly focusing on different things. The way to beat Jerry is different than the way to beat Devon.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, we will see. We will see how it will be. I think Devon surprised Hermes like he surprised me. Did Devon surprise you when he stood Hermes up and was just totally okay up top early? Like, that was surprising to me, which...
Travis Bagent: Then, because of that match, gave everyone the authority or at least the opinion that Devon had a chance against LeVon. So, you know, and listen, also, we can both work as hard as we want. We can both be amazing and one of us have a better day.
Travis Bagent: And Devon had a better day than Hermes. And when you draw reference from that, you see where Devon struggles. And it always ends with a big guy pressing at the end, or at least at some version of it. And before, until Hermes shows me that he has that in his category, it's a tough one. Yeah. And do you agree with the comment from Neil?
Unknown Speaker: Okay.
