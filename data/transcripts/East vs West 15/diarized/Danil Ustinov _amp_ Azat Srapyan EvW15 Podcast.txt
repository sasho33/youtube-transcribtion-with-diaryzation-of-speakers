I asked him to ask him as well, but he didn't. I don't know. He didn't find information either. I mean, he's online on Messenger. I hope he doesn't have problems, you know.
Azat Srapyan: Yeah, on that day, like maybe his phone needed charging or something. What's that? Like, I guess, like he was inside the car driving or something and he could not respond or like the low battery. Yeah, but he didn't respond next day either, you know. Wow.

Engin Terzi: that Genadi has this kind of things, you know, like this is like not the first time that like he is answering a few days later, you know, I don't know what he's busy with, but either he's not checking his messages, but I don't think that he, he forgets that he had a podcast. Is that your internet or my internet? I don't know.
Engin Terzi: The same thing is happening again, you know. Yeah. Guys, is it my internet or Lasha's internet? Now it looks normal, but.

Engin Terzi: Because this way we cannot do the show because we don't understand what you're saying. Okay.
Engin Terzi: Hello, Azat. Azat, you need to turn your camera on and sound on. Hello.
Engin Terzi: Hello Danil, how are you? Good, good. Good, that's good. Just wait a little bit for the translator. I don't know why Azat's microphone is off. I think he's first time using.
Engin Terzi: Hello. Hello, Azat. Azat, turn your camera on. Just now. I don't know why I can't. We are first time using Zoom. This is the framework we can find. I understand. Yeah, you just need to touch the screen, and then you will see that there will be camera sign, microphone sign.
Engin Terzi: touch the camera and then it will be on. If it is connected, of course. Okay, yes, yes, yes. How are you? Good, good. How are you? Fine, fine. Yeah. Now Roman will join. I don't know. I sent him the link. And because I think Lasha didn't have good internet.
Engin Terzi: How are you, Azat? Good? Good, thanks. Fine, and you? Good, good, good. So looks like you don't need translator. Maybe, yes. Can you hear me, guys? Yeah, we see you and we hear you. Yes, yes, yes, my friend. Yeah. Okay. So how is the preparation, Azat? Yeah, now we can hear you.
Engin Terzi: Everything's good. We come after training right now. Everything's going well. It's going very good for him. Okay. Are you going to beat this young guy, Azat? I think yes. You think yes? Danil. Danil.
Engin Terzi: how are you good okay how is the preparation
Danil Ustinov: They speak Russian without me. He just translated and he answered that everything is going smooth. I mean, okay, maybe he can do it. Maybe you don't worry about the Roma. Maybe. But you have things that you want to stay or you want to work? I will stay for a while. I can just either stay here, yeah, maybe make sure things go smooth. Yeah, maybe in India. Yes, brother. Okay, Danil.
Danil Ustinov: uh azad just said that he's gonna beat you you agree with that i know you don't but let's still see you know what you say okay who's gonna translate my friend you you can translate uh if you because you spoke good russian so you can translate and if it's okay uh if you need me then i will help you out okay okay okay okay
Translator: Danil, how is your preparation? How do you think you will fight Azat? The preparation continues. We are slowly reaching the peak. I think we will show a very spectacular and beautiful fight with Azat. Let him win. The main thing is no injuries.
Translator: He's saying that he's in very good shape and he's already at his peak, coming to his peak. And he thinks it will be a very good match for both of them. Very interesting. Okay. And Danil, okay, you say it's going to be a good match, but how do you see your chances? Danil, what do you think? What are your chances? Well, in percentage terms.
Translator: Okay, he's saying that it's kind of 50-50, but he's saying he's going to win. For him, it's like that's his plan. Yeah, yeah, that's normal, yeah. Okay, I understand. And...
Engin Terzi: Like you both are outside pullers. You both go outside, not inside. And you both had very dominant performance at the WAF. And Azat, you have very strong hand and wrist. And Danil is going with the back pressure and then he goes sideways. Do you think he can top roll your wrist?
Translator: He is confident. He thinks that he might open his wrist, Danil's wrist. Azat says he can open his wrist. That's his point. Because his hand is strong and Danil is attacking for stylistic, it's a good match for Azat.
Translator: Yes, yes. Both are top-level men. Danil, Azat thinks that, you know, stylistically it is a good match for him. Do you agree with that? Danil, Azat says that it will be interesting, but he will be able to open your hand. What do you think about that?
Translator: Well, let them try to do it. We are not standing still, we are preparing. And this fight will be a gift, a surprise. So, Oleg is also confident. He doubted that Azat can open his wrist because he is training and improving each day. And he is very young. How old are you, Danil? Danil, how old are you?
Engin Terzi: I'm 20 years old. I'll be 21 in three months. Danil, at the World Championships, did you compete with seniors or with young people?
Translator: No, I won both Jumash and Zolot. Two categories. Good. Engin, he won both. In Seniors and Youth category also. And did he win Youth category, Left Arm as well? So he won three goals? Danil, you have three gold there, right?
Translator: No, I have two golds in my right hand, and in my left hand I fought only for the adults and became the third. Young people don't fight because of the injuries. And I decided to fight for the adults. So you didn't fight for the young people in the right hand? No, I didn't fight for the young people in the left hand, and I have two golds in my right hand and there. Okay, so he won two golds, and on the left, Senor, third place, Engin.
Engin Terzi: And he didn't compete the youth category left? No, no right-hand youth category, no. He didn't compete. Oh, he didn't compete right-hand? Yes. So he competed the youth category with left? Yes, he won on left. So youth category only left, senior, left and right. Okay. Yes, yes. Okay, okay. Okay, I understand. Azat, originally you were going to pull against Hunter.
Engin Terzi: But Hunter got injured and you're going to pull Danil. So is it for you a harder match or easier match? He's saying that for him it will be harder. So he was thinking Hunter would be easier? Yes, yes, yes, of course. Okay, okay.
Engin Terzi: Danil, for a long time, you wanted to have a match at the East versus West. You wrote to me on Instagram, give me a match, give me a match, give me a match. So finally you got your match. Are you happy?
Translator: He's saying of course he's happy.
Engin Terzi: He wants to show everyone how strong he is. Okay. And Azat, if you win this match, who do you want next? Maybe Taras Fahis. Taras Fahis? Really? Yes, yes. Yeah, why not? Why not? Yeah. And you, Danil, if you beat Azat, who do you want to play against?
Translator: Danil, if you win, who do you want to see your next opponent? I want to fight Prokopchuk. Either left-handed or right-handed. Unfortunately, we didn't meet at the World Championship. If there was such an opportunity, I would fight him in an armfight. After Azat, Danil wants to fight Prokopchuk Danil. No difference right or left for him.
Translator: Okay, he wants to category in 70 or 77 for Danil because I don't think Danil will go down. So he wants to pull him in 77? Okay.
Engin Terzi: Yes, in 77 because he's not going to lose weight for that much. Okay. Okay. And but so he wants to pull Danil Prokopchuk but Danil Prokopchuk is champion in 77 kilo left arm. And but he also lost to another opponent at 12. So does he think that
Translator: that it should be the match against Danil when he lost against the Turkish footballer. Danil Engin asks, you were in the semifinal with the Turkish team, right? You lost to him, right? And he says that the Turkish team won against Prokopchuk. Do you think you can compete with him?
Translator: Well, there were a lot of reasons for this defeat, but it's not an excuse. As everyone saw, I already fought with my right hand with a bandage. My hand cracked before training, so I didn't fight with the youth. But if they give me a certain amount of time to prepare, I think I have every chance to fight. Danil's wrist is not as strong as we've all seen. I think I can fight with everyone here.
Translator: So, at the moment, I want to beat him. Okay. Danil is saying that he is confident and he thinks that if he knows the date, he will prepare very good and he has a chance to beat Prokopchuk for sure. Okay. Okay, I understand.
Danil Ustinov: He also said, and I will just add up to it, he translated, he said that there was a reason why he did not become number one on left arm because there were some injuries, but he translated as the time is there, he would definitely dedicate himself to peak at 100% and perform the best. Yeah. Okay.
Engin Terzi: Ok, how it will be. So, Azat, generally, how do you see the East vs West 15 card? Did you like all the matches? Yes, yes. What is your favorite match? Favorite match? Larratt vs Petrenko. And Danil, what is your favorite match at the East vs West 15?
Translator: Which match is the most interesting? It's hard to answer here. All matches are very equal and interesting. But I would really like to watch the armfight of Georgii Dzeranov and Vitalii Laletin. I think it will be a very interesting fight. And also Ivan Muratov and Ivan Ivan Matyushenko. Also very interesting. And all fights are very close.
Engin Terzi: Danil is saying that there is many interesting matches, but very interesting is Alizhan vs. Muratov and Dzeranov vs. Laletin. Let's talk about the matches and your opinions. Let's start. Who is winning?
Engin Terzi: Azat, you tell me. Azat vs. Danil, who is winning? Oh, yeah. Who be strong? The stronger one. Okay, who is the stronger one? I think Sevan. We can see on the table. We can see on the table. Okay. So, you are not sure of yourself. I understand.
Engin Terzi: You are not sure? I have a surprise. You have a surprise, okay. Danil, who's winning? Azat or Danil? November 2nd. Who's going to have the world champion belt? Who will be the winner? Who will have the belt?
Translator: The same answer. The stronger will be the winner.
Engin Terzi: It's good that I get to learn something that I didn't know. Politically correct people. Yeah. Okay. And let's talk about Irina Gladkaya versus Brigitta Ivan. I think, why Irina Gladkaya?
Engin Terzi: Danil Glatka is going to win? Yes, yes. And how do you see this, Danil? Danil, how do you think, who will win? I think Irina Glatka will win. Yeah, Danil thinks also that Irina is going to win. So they both think that Irina is going to win. Okay, let's go to the next world title match. Artur Makarov versus Ömer Farukh Kozakoğlu.
Engin Terzi: Azat, did you compete against Ömer in Istanbul? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Is he strong? Yes, very strong. I recorded the video. I think the Turkish, what is the name, Wien. Ömer, Ömer? Yes, yes, Ömer Wien. You think Ömer is going to beat Artur Makarov? Yes, yes, I think that. Interesting.
Engin Terzi: You think he will take his wrist? Yes. Yes. And how do you see this match, Danil? Danil thinking that Artur is going to win. Artur is going to win. So, Danil, you think Artur is going to hook him and beat?
Engin Terzi: Danil is saying that he's going to beat him with his side pressure. Side pressure, like straight side pressure. Okay. Yes. And let's go to the next world title match. Davit Samushia versus Vladimir Maiorov.
Translator: How's that? Very interesting match. Very interesting match, yes. But I think Samushia again win. Again win? Yes, I think so. How's that? You speak very good. Good English. I mean, your English is doing well, yeah. And Danil? Danil, what do you think? Samushia or Maiorov? Well, it's very interesting. I wanted Maiorov
Translator: Danil is saying that it's a very, very interesting match, but he's on the major side because it will be interesting if there will be a new world champion.
Engin Terzi: that's good okay so he says that it's enough we need new world champions okay okay and let's go to the next one
Engin Terzi: It is very easy to talk about these matches with you guys because you guys are also from WAF, so you know the opponents. Carolina Pettersson vs Dimitrina Petrova. 60kg world champion vs 65kg world champion. It's the same. Carolina Pettersson. Carolina Pettersson with the top row? Yes. And you, Danil?
Engin Terzi: What do you think, Danil? Who will win? Yes, I think Carolina will win. Yes, the same answer I give. Okay, that's interesting. Because in Kazakhstan, Danil, Kazakhstan-WAF, Dimitrina beat Carolina in the finale.
Translator: In Kazakhstan, how was it in the final? In the final, they fought, right? Who won in the end? I didn't have time to watch this fight. I didn't come to this championship with my right hand. I fought with my left hand and didn't watch other fights. What did you say?
Translator: He's saying that he wasn't there. He didn't see the final match. Yeah. And Danil, do you know which style Dimitrina is doing and which style Carolina is doing? Danil, do you know which techniques they use? Carolina is doing the top, and Dimitrina is doing the hook, right? I didn't watch these athletes very closely, but I know their wrestling. I thought Carolina would win.
Translator: Danil is saying that he is not for sure, but Carolina will win. He doesn't know their style? Yes, yes. He doesn't know for sure their style. And you, Azat, do you know their style?
Engin Terzi: i i don't know wow oh you guys compete in the same place okay you guys are no different than alexa alexa said that carolina is going to win with the flop risk while dimitrina is hook player and then carolina is a top roller but who knows let's maybe dimitrina with this time will top roll
Engin Terzi: Who knows, maybe it will be right. Engin, to be fair, at the first time when Danil was asked this question, he said Carolina would go outside at first. Okay, but he doesn't know the style right now. Okay. But he said he doesn't carefully watch them. Okay, yeah. See, even Andre thinking that Carolina will win with proper press. Yeah, I know he's joking, but it's okay. Anyway, so let's go to the next one.
Engin Terzi: um iraqis rakashvili versus georgie tautiev uh yeah please yeah he thinks that directly is easy or hard yes yes very much three two three two wow it cannot be three two if three two it means that it needs to be one more round because this is
Engin Terzi: World title match. You need to win four times. Four times? Yeah, yeah. Like, if it is world title match, you need to win four times. If it is now world title, three times. So you need to beat Danil four times. I understand. Yeah. I understand. Okay. And Danil? Who do you think will win, Danil? I think it will be an interesting fight, even though everyone is betting on Irakli's victory.
Translator: Danil is saying that it will be very, very tough and interesting match and the winner is going to be the one who is more endurable. Okay. Yeah. And let's go to the next one, Azat.
Engin Terzi: Betkili Oniani versus Oleg Dzok. Oleg Dzok. Oleg Dzok is going to beat Betkili? Really? Yes. Wow. Okay. And Danil? That will be no easy. No easy? No easy.
Engin Terzi: Okay, okay. Yesterday, Oleg Zhokh said that his chance to win is 40%. And he said, Betkili has 60% chance. Oleg said that his opponent has more chance to win yesterday on the podcast. And Danil, who's winning? Zhokh or Betkili? Who will win, Danil?
Translator: Zhokh or Betkili? I think Betkili will win, but it will be a tough fight. I think Betkili will win. Okay. Danil is saying maybe Betkili will manage to win, but very hard, very hard match.
Engin Terzi: They both think the same way. They both expect a very tough match, but Azat thinks that Oleg is going to win and Danil thinks that Betkili is going to win. Yes. Okay. Okay, let's go to the next category. Azat, do you know Kanai?
Engin Terzi: Yoshinobu Kanai. I don't know him. You don't know him? Okay. So it's very hard to guess. And Danil, do you know Kanai? Danil, do you know this athlete, Yoshinobu Kanai? I don't know him either. Wow, they don't know Kanai. But I don't know. That's interesting. Okay, so let's... Too young, too young, man. They are too young. I don't know.

Engin Terzi: Azat, Devon versus Petrenko. Petrenko. I think Petrenko. Petrenko is going to win? Yes, very hard match, but I think Petrenko will win. Do you believe four times Petrenko can pin Larratt? Yes. Okay. And Danil? How do you think, Danil, who will win? Larratt or Petrenko? I also think that Oleg Petrenko will win this fight.
Engin Terzi: Okay, Danil is saying the same. Petrenko for the win. Oh, that's interesting. That's interesting, yeah. And... Rino Matic versus Ibragim Sagov. How's that? Matic. Rino Matic. Rino Matic is going to win? Yes. Easy, hard...
Translator: No easy. Hard. No easy. Okay. And what do you think, Danil? Who will win, Danil? Irina Masich or Ibragim Sagov? Again, 50-50. 50-50. These are very interesting fights. It's hard to choose a certain athlete. Because they're about the same. I think 50-50. Who will win?
Engin Terzi: okay daniel is saying that it's 50 50 very interesting match because both are they both the same style with the shoulder pressure this is a world title match is very very important match yeah and ivan matushenko versus alijan murado alijan murado and i think uh you are very easy
Engin Terzi: Easy? Do you think he's going to be easy? Yes. Okay, we'll see. And you, Danil, Ivan versus Alizhan? I also think it's a very easy win for Alizhan. Danil is saying the same. Alizhan for the win, very easy.
Engin Terzi: Wow, easy, huh? Okay, Azat, if you guys think that Ali Can is going to win easy, who can beat Ali Can on this earth with left hand? Nobody. Not even Laletin? No, no, no.
Engin Terzi: No? Only Levan. Only Levan. Levan is injured. He will not pull left arm. No? No, no. He did not heal well, yeah. Nobody? Nobody, yeah. Yeah, I mean, he's not going to pull. So, Danil, do you think that Levin can beat Alizhan? Danil, do you think that Levin can beat Alizhan?
Translator: But my opinion is that we won't win at the moment. But I really wanted to watch this fight.
Translator: What do you think, Danil, how will Alizhan Laletin win? What technique? In the hook, I saw someone opening Alizhan's wrist too much. Danil says that Alizhan's wrist is very strong, so he's going to win him with side pressure, hook side pressure.
Engin Terzi: So they both think that nobody on this earth can beat Ali Can. I think yes. Interesting. That's interesting, yeah. Okay. And let's go to the next one. Genadi quick winner, Michael Todd. I think Genadi can beat him. Hard match?
Translator: No hard, but he beat Tracys. And you, Danil, how do you see? Danil is saying the same, that it will be a very, very hard match, but Kvikvinia is going to win.
Engin Terzi: Usually they agree with the things, you know, and then let's go. I forgot one message between Oguzhan Kochak and Nugo Chikadze. 50-50. 50-50, yes. Very interesting. 50-50. Okay. And Danil? Danil, do you know Oguzhan Kochak? Danil, do you know who Oguzhan Kochak is?
Translator: Yes, I know both athletes. I think it will be interesting too. Yes, Danil is saying he knows both athletes. So also very, very interesting match like 50-50. Okay. And then let's go to Laletin versus Dzeranov. Dzeranov. I think Dzeranov. Dzeranov will beat Laletin?
Danil Ustinov: Yes. Wow. That is very interesting. You see, Engin, how good matchmaker you are right now. That proves. Not like one-sided, everybody would say, because people are saying that Dzeranov has a chance and he may win. So it's a great match. I mean, we know all the possibilities. He has a chance to beat him, but we don't know which possibility will happen. And Danil, I know you are from Kazakhstan.
Engin Terzi: Dzeranov from Kazakhstan as well. How do you see the match against Laletin? Danil, do you think Dzeranov is going to win? Can you ask him how he's going to win? Which style he's going to win?
Translator: Is he going to hook him? Is he going to tap roll him? Is he going to beat him with up the wrist? Or how is it going to be? Danil saying that he don't know for sure, but Georgii can do both.
Engin Terzi: And top role as well. And you, Azat? Azat, you hook. He will hook him? He will hook Laletin? It is not that easy. That's not easy, but he hook Revas right away. But just remember, Morozov also hook Revas, but he couldn't hook Laletin. So we will see how it will be. We will see how it will be, yeah.
Engin Terzi: and yeah um is there is there anything more you guys would like to add about the event he said nothing to say very great event
Engin Terzi: Very good, Ivan, and he's happy to be part of it. Yeah, we are also happy that you guys are part of it. Andrea is asking how Di Dzeranov beat Vitalii. I have seen a few. I have seen him with side pressure within him. But you are asking the right arm, right? Yeah, right arm I don't remember. Left arm I remember he did back pressure and with side pressure. Right arm I don't remember how it went, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Do you have anything to say to your opponent?
Translator: Danil is saying only good luck for his opponent, no injuries, until they meet at the table. It will be a very good match. Yeah, I agree.
Engin Terzi: Engin, are you planning to add 70kg left hand match also? Yes, my friend. Every category will have left and right, but not in this event. Danil, you are very active on social media, but you are not super active on the podcast. Danil, Engin says you are very active on the internet, but not so active.
Translator: i don't think that because of the translator here no translator
Engin Terzi: It doesn't matter, you are translating for him. What he meant was like whenever we are talking, his translator by side would also in his ear translate everything that we are talking because sometimes... That's not about the translator, he is not a verbally challenging guy, you understand?
Engin Terzi: he's like i wish my opponent best stronger is gonna win 50 50 you understand it's like classic eastern guy the outside is the same you know they like full respect it's good it's good not nothing bad but yeah yeah i was expecting him to be more like since he's young and he would be more like like you know when you are young you know you you want to like like
Translator: You're not that careful always, but maybe because he's so young and he has respect. Maybe you translate him what I said? Yes, yes. Engin says, Danil, he thinks that since you're very young, you should be more energetic in this regard. I left all my energy for the match, and I'm already ready for the belt.
Engin Terzi: Okay. Danil is saying that all energy is... For the table, right? Yeah. Whenever they announce it, they will come to the table. He will go like...
Engin Terzi: He also said that he has already prepared the stand where he will put his belt. Oh. He also prepared it. Yeah, he just said it. OK. OK. What do you think about it, Azat? He said that he prepared where he's going to put the belt. He probably made a nice corner at his room. .
Engin Terzi: Nothing to add, he's saying, nothing to add about it. Do you, okay, if you guys are not in, let me do it. Azat, do you want Danil to send you the photo of the belt where he put in his room? Yes.
Translator: Yes, you want him to send his belt photo? If he can win me, no problem. If he can win me, no problem. If he can.
Engin Terzi: And Azat, you are being shy, but he said that he already prepared a corner for his place, his belt. And are you not going to tell him that that will not happen?
Translator: Azat is saying the main thing that if he can do as he thought, maybe it will be the other way and the belt will go with him. Okay. And the last thing, Danil, when you win the belt against Azat,
Translator: Will you allow him to have a photo with it? I think he understood. Danil is saying that he can put Azat with the belt on his bicep and make a photo.
Engin Terzi: so he will allow him yes he said he said that he will put azad and belt both on his arm and make the photo like that oh he will put both of them on the his bicep oh okay okay okay see now we are talking about trash trash talk yeah that's good that's good you spicy dubbing yes yes yes because if it was them up to them it would be
