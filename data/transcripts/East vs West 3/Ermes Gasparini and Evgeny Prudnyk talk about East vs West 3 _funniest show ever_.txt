SPEAKER_02: But now we are online. Yes, yes, yes. We are online. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Everybody on the chat, they are saying that in your next Supermatch, your opponent will break your arm. They say this. No problem, my friend. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: This event is very, very beautiful. Very interesting match. Dave, Vigna, Matt Mask, Prudnik. Okay, before Prudnik comes, or maybe you say this when Prudnik comes, I will ask your prediction, I will ask your opinion about Matt Mask and Prudnik. But not now. Let Prudnik come. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_02: And you? You have a super match in August or not? In August, yeah. In August, yeah. Now, no. I'm still... What? Is it true with Ryan Bowen or is it false? Yes. Ah, yes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you never know. Never know.
SPEAKER_02: John says that he's very dangerous. Yes? Yeah, John says, yeah. He says that in strap, you know, he has good chance to beat me. This is what I understood from what he said. Really? I don't know. John says so. I showed the tournament in Australia.
SPEAKER_02: Very, very, very beautiful. The same over the top film. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like a stage up there. Yeah, it's fantastic. Fantastic. Yeah, yeah. OK, so the link and I think it's coming anyway, so you started training and
SPEAKER_02: you say that you will wait until the results of the east versus west and then you will make your decision yes okay i have a question for you if if they wins against gennady do you want to pull dave yes yes yeah but yeah before i want to devil
SPEAKER_01: If Devon continues to run away from me, I don't continue to ask for a Supermatch like this. Hermes, do you think that Devon is running away from you? Yes, 100%.
SPEAKER_01: After Levan, he didn't have an excuse to run away from me. You understand? No, say it again, one more time. Yeah, Rudnicki. What did you say? After the match with Levan, I think Levan won.
SPEAKER_02: Devon doesn't have an excuse for running away from me. Understand? Yeah, but Devon says that after his match with Levan, he wants to rest, a little bit rest. How long? Two years? Three years? No, I think for five months. Hello, Evgeny, how are you?
SPEAKER_02: Okay, I'm fine. Hello. Nice to meet you. Oh, Gasparini. Amigo. Amigo. Hermes, ask him to sing for us. Okay, okay. Where are you? The book. Evgeny, Evgeny. Oh.
SPEAKER_02: Just just put the camera somewhere that the light is not so much coming to here because it makes you so dark yeah it's it's kind of better. yeah make sure that light is not seen from the side yeah I can you it's possible to turn the camera or no like to say. it's possible yeah. yeah okay yeah. Just make it a little bit higher, so that we can see your face yeah that's good.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. So, Hermes, I was asking you, if they, okay, what I understand that Devon is going to pull Levan, and no matter what the result is, Devon wants to get some rest. He wants to not to compete minimum, what I understand, three months minimum. So what I just think that if Devon pulls you, my guess, my opinion, I think it will be end of the year, end of the year, not in the summer.
SPEAKER_02: So if Dave beats Gennady, you say you want to pull Dave. But if Dave loses against Gennady, and then if the Russians are now banned by both WAF and other organizations, but if the war finish and everything is okay, if Dave loses Gennady, who would you want to pull? Would you want to pull Laletin? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: yes yeah okay so this this is this is what i was gonna ask you yeah this is this for me that that that makes sense that makes sense yes yes i i think same okay and if if they loses if they look favorite if they loses and if latin is still cannot compete the world continue then
SPEAKER_01: Who do you want to pull? Do you want to pull someone like Jerry? Jerry is interesting, yes. But he told the people who beat him, he put the money one for two, like this.
SPEAKER_01: I don't understand. I saw the video of Devon Larratt. He told it like this. Okay, so he puts his own money. If you put $10,000 with Jerry, if you win, you take the $20,000. And Devon, I saw the video of Devon Larratt.
SPEAKER_01: He told me he wanted to beat Jerry for this money. I mean, we offer. If people accept, if they accept. If they don't accept, then what to do? We do the next better match. Okay. Now we see the tournament and after we talk about
SPEAKER_02: My next supermatch. Yes, yes. We are just chatting, you know, so. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And Evgeny, how are you, my friend? Normal. Normal. I am normal. Yeah. See, last time we talked, you and Matt Mask, you said that you were thinking that you will be 80%. But then when we chat privately, you said you will be 95%.
SPEAKER_00: So you will be about 95%, yeah? I have 85%, but it's a very big percent for Matt Mask. Oh, your 85% is enough for him, huh? It's a very big percent for Chance Matt Mask.
SPEAKER_02: Matt Mask not chance if I 25%. I understand. I understand. Okay. This guy is an interesting guy. He told me privately he was 95%. Now he says he's 35%. Do you know why he says he's 95%? Now I am 19% now. 90%. See, three days ago you were 95%. And then one day you were 85%. And now one minute later you are 90%.
SPEAKER_02: These guys are incredible about the percentages. My percent more. More, more every day. Every day, okay. Oh, my God. Do you know why he says this 85%, Hermes? Because if he loses to Matt, he will say, oh, I was only 85%. Yes, he has a ready excuse.
SPEAKER_01: excuse right excuse he's crazy yeah it's good strategy you understand what if you lose you have a excuse you are not in your best shape yeah but if you think is enough no problem yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: he said that he said that you you say i also say you are 85 because if matt beats you you will say i lost because i'm 85 yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: It's a super tactic. And how about Tobias? And if I win with my 85%, I will tell he is not my level. Yeah? Okay. And then are you going to tell him on the press conference that he's not at your level? Huh?
SPEAKER_02: you will tell to matt also in the press conference yeah yeah is that your level if yeah if i win oh but but you told tomorrow's of this before the match you said in the press conference but now you're gonna tell to matt after if you win
SPEAKER_00: after if yeah if i win i i will tell him uh if you talk about with matt mask you are not my labor you understand and what and what okay i thought i'll tell you that before okay
SPEAKER_00: before yeah yeah at the press conference you're gonna say right and before after after three rounds i tell that and how about tobias will you beat tobias with left hand tobias on left arm okay my left arm is normal now better than uh last mouse uh i am
SPEAKER_00: my left arm uh hell now hell as a great side pressure and wrist it's okay and how do you see your chance percentage with tobias with left arm um my chance yeah how many well i don't know i think maybe one one thousand
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you will beat him? 1,000 percent, yeah. So, Tobias is not your level? No. No? Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah. And, Hermes, what do you think about this, his matches with Matt Mask, honestly? Honestly, with Matt Mask,
SPEAKER_01: For me, the favorite is Prudnik, but Matt Mask is very smart in the setup. Yeah. And in the last year, in June, I tried... One moment. Terminator.
SPEAKER_01: You see me now? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, last June you tried what against Matt? What? One moment. Because my imagination is blocked. One moment.
SPEAKER_02: Anyways, so you're ready, huh, Hermes? Yeah. Yeah, that's good. That's good. And what's your weight now? Still 107? 100. I don't know. 108. 108. 108. Now you're okay? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. I try going the hook with Matt mask, but, uh, he's pronated very strong. Uh, I can't go in the hook. I remember you can't maybe, maybe in the strap is more easy. Easily. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: if if if prudnik goes outside and if matt mass goes outside bob couple who is this risk is taking who is winning
SPEAKER_01: I don't know because... Prudnik, Prudnik. Yeah, come on, come on, Hermes. Matt would take him. In the top role, same, but in the top role, it's difficult for Prudnik. I don't know. 50-50 is difficult. But here, Prudnik go. The first in the hook, I think win Prudnik. In the strap or without strap?
SPEAKER_00: I can win Matt Mask in hook and top roll together. And Brittany, can you beat him without strap? Can you beat Matt without strap? And without strap and with strap. And hook and top roll.
SPEAKER_02: wow this guy is the guy is brave you know i have a plan i have a plan yeah i think about this but evgeny i i'm thinking that matt is going to take your wrist my wrist yeah no yeah especially without the strap i think he's gonna make your wrist
SPEAKER_02: no possible yeah he's he's he's coming you know very very strong no he he's you know you know what his weight right now huh do you know his weight right now what's his weight right now my mask yeah 130 kilo 130 oh okay
SPEAKER_02: Remember last time when Raimonds joked him, he said that, you know, Morozov easily beats Ongarbaev, but you hardly beat him. And he was like, I have a big respect for this guy. I see. I remember, I remember.
SPEAKER_02: Respect this athlete. But where is Kurdejka? I don't know. I sent him a link. I gave him the time as well. And I said 10 o'clock. And I said Italy time because of you. He said, oh, Poland and Italy has the same time. So I sent him the link. And then, so I don't know. I don't have his phone number. So I don't know. Maybe I try.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe the time in Poland is different than, you know, the time in... Anyways. One moment. Yep. Mad Mask is going to destroy you, Rudnick. He's going to destroy you. Yes, you will see. See? I have only 85%. What do you want?
SPEAKER_02: oh okay that's why you know now i'm joking with you that matt mass will destroy you you know that i'm joking but if i would tell this to someone from the west they will start saying that oh you hate north americans and you hold the side of east but i can joke with you guys because you know that
SPEAKER_02: I'm only joking, you know, I don't really care who wins, you know, as long as everything is fair and square. And then the winner, I say bravo, you know, I don't care if it is East or West or we all are arm masters. They do East versus West because just to create excitement, you know, we all are fellow arm masters. Whatever. And Hermes, what do you think about the other matches? You know, you know, the guys,
SPEAKER_02: Did you see anything about what Zurab said about himself and about John? Zurab, this John? Zurab said that... Did you see Zurab's arms? Yes. I mean, like legs, you know, just like, you know... And he said... Two legs. Left leg and right leg. Four legs. Four.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and Zurab said he is 50%. He is dog, dog or monkey. Just be quiet, I'm trying to say something. He said that he is now 50%, 5-0, 50% stronger than the time he pulled Rambat. And he said he's going to beat John.
SPEAKER_02: and he also said he also said that after he beat john he wants a super super match with the super heavyweights excluding leon he is ready to pull anyone he said it's it's really yeah yeah he said yeah and i said hermes maybe he said hermes is too easy bring the letting no no no this one
SPEAKER_01: It's very interesting, but for me, John Brzezinski, he has more control, hand control. Yes, pronator. And maybe Zurab.
SPEAKER_01: He has a possibility to win for endurance. You understand? Yeah, I understand. I think maybe John could take the hand of Zurab, but Zurab continuing with the side pressure. Is it possible? Maybe, but little percent. Okay. How much percent for winning three rounds for John and how much for Zurab?
SPEAKER_00: For me, John, 75. And 25 for Zurab. And what do you think, Prudnik? I don't understand. Zurab wins Levan Seginashvili, no?
SPEAKER_02: oh no no no no no no no no okay he said that he is in very good form and he said he will be john and after that he wants to arm muscle with the all super heavy weights but not not levan levan is too strong but he said that he wants to pull the supreme weights he said okay
SPEAKER_00: uh i think uh john brzenk wins him because he will be a control his wrist and who if john brzenk if uh
SPEAKER_00: open wrist anywhere sportsman he win always he win always i understand so it is not possible to be drawn like this this is what i think not possible i think but he has a leg he has a leg
SPEAKER_00: maybe he can win him uh without wrist without wrist yeah and and guys yes i will sign the t-shirts as well yes there was a question yes and so you what is the percentage you give john and israel uh i think john the 60 percent drop 40. yeah
SPEAKER_00: So it is possible for Zurab to win rounds? Zurab can win only without wrist if he can do it only in this position. So I think he can't twist him. I understand. What if John wins two rounds and then third round if John goes inside with Zurab? That is probable or not?
SPEAKER_00: if john in hook will be in two times if and then john goes hook with drop i think john lose i think don't john lose don't lose if he goes inside yeah and what do you think but uh in uh this situation 50 50 because john can control him his uh
SPEAKER_02: and wrist control too in hook and maybe 50 50 but drop a very big percent uh for his angle i understand yep and and and uh what do you think about uh guys uh uh phil can you please share uh hermes's uh youtube channel link he has a new youtube uh channel
SPEAKER_02: and so if guys you know if you are not subscribed you know you uh please subscribe uh hermes's new uh youtube channel thank you no i mean everyone our masters you are you are one of the uh greatest right now i hope you will become greatest of
SPEAKER_02: one of the greatest of all times, but still need to do more, more, more job. Yeah. What do you, what do you think about, uh, uh, Dave Chaffee and, uh, Dan, I root for, uh,
SPEAKER_01: because he's my friend. But they have the same style, you understand. Maybe they match without control hand, but without control hand and only side pressure.
SPEAKER_02: But I think they have more chance to win. I think that if they win, they need to take Gennady's wrist like the last time. But I think if they both lose the wrist like this, then I think Gennady now has a chance because it is not the same when you dominate the hand or you are like this.
SPEAKER_02: I'm sure that Gennady is like this strong as well. But if he is like this, he is... No, no, I'm talking about Dave. Dave is strong, you know. Whenever Dave beat Gennady, some years ago, he was dominating his hand. And he had his hand like this. But this time, as you show, if they both go like this, then there may be a problem for Dave as well. Yes, 50-50.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, I think that there is 50% or maybe 60% for me possibility that Dave is just going to, you know, win. Yeah. But another like 50, 40% that Dave is going to go and then if he loses wrist and then Gennady will stop him here and then Gennady has better endurance, my opinion. Yeah, I think too. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And what do you think, Evgeny? I saw the legs of Dave Chaffee. Dave Chaffee is very strong now. Very high weight.
SPEAKER_00: And I think it's a very cool form, a very great form now for Dave Chaffee. And I don't know, in a fight with Gennady Kipvinya, I don't know who will win. 50-50.
SPEAKER_02: But it will be a very interesting match. I have a question for you, Ermes. You went to Dubai and there you spent some time together with Alex, right? That is maybe not right thing, but what did Alex say about his form? Is his form in Dubai was as good as his form when he beat you?
SPEAKER_01: You mean what is my form in Dubai? No, his form, Alex's form in Dubai was better than the time that Alex pulled you when he beat you. He told me before the match because he has parents in Ukraine and the mentality is not very...
SPEAKER_01: strong and before the match he told me he started to prepare the match with Vitaly and after the match is deleted and he stopped the preparation and it's not very very good preparation for this match. Dave also said that
SPEAKER_00: he had a very short notice. He will prepare only 85%, yeah? What? He prepared only 85% Kurdesha, yeah?
SPEAKER_02: he's he's telling about himself because he says he's 85 he says that you know alex was 85 as well you know he's just joking i think yeah yeah yeah anyway so dave also was asked in the last minute you know like they wasn't getting prepared for a match they said dave you want to pull alex it he also had very short time to prepare as well
SPEAKER_01: But after the competition and before the competition, the world is nothing, you understand? The important thing is the match, if you win or lose.
SPEAKER_01: If you don't have a time for preparation, you don't have excuse after the competition and don't do my best shape like this. If you don't have a time, you stay home and finish. Yeah, I understand. Yeah, I agree. I agree. Yeah. Yeah. So then then if you go
SPEAKER_02: marcio marcio barbosa versus tobias because got injured in the shoulder huh he have a injury in the shoulder people i don't know he pulled asian championships he won but he he doesn't feel good i don't know if it's shoulder or elbow or wrist i don't know but he he didn't want to pull
SPEAKER_00: and then so we replace with Tobias. Do you think Tobias has chance against Marcio? I think win Barbosa because he great he rest he great wrestling pulling
SPEAKER_00: down part down part here this point he very great twist and i think for tobias it's uh now uh very bad um so you think that i i didn't follow sorry do you think that if i didn't misunderstand that you think that barbosa will hook tobias
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah but what if they both go outside outside no then you can't do it if barbosa will be wrestling uh pulling top roll he can't do it anything because but if tobias very great here uh high point in high point very great
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah but if barbosa will be rest wrestling down position down position i think tobias can lose okay so you are saying that if marcio manages to go inside and then he's gonna he's gonna like uh like uh
SPEAKER_00: uh fight with morozov when morozov uh go in top roll he lose everyone morozov uh go and uh and hook twist him in down position uh morozov wins yeah i saw wrestling uh so pulling uh and i think he can win
SPEAKER_02: People call me Engin Percentage Terzi. So you are saying that Marcio has more chances? Barboza has more chances. 60% for me. So you think also Marcio is going to win? 60%.
SPEAKER_02: And do you also agree with him that Marcio can win only in hook? Yes, only in hook. On top block? Not possible. Not possible, okay. I understand. Anyway, so if we go to another match, Derek Simit versus Morozov, right arm. I think Morozov...
SPEAKER_01: He's coming back stronger than last time. Morozov? And for me, Morozov has a good possibility to win. 60%, 65% for Morozov. And what do you think, Evgeny?
SPEAKER_00: I think Matt Mask lose Morozov before and after lose me. Right? Do you understand? No. No, no, no, no, no. I'm talking about Morozov right arm with Derek Smith. Ah, Derek Smith? Yeah. You know him? I don't remember Derek Smith.
SPEAKER_02: Derek Simit just had a super match with Tim Bresnan. You know Tim Bresnan? Uh-huh. Do you know Tim from Top 8? Yeah? Maybe, yeah. Yeah. You don't know Tim Bresnan? The American guy with the glasses? Tim Bresnan? Yeah. No. What? Who is it? Come on. I know, I know.
SPEAKER_02: who is interesting okay then this guy direct meeting yes pretty much direct beat kim bresnan yeah direct beat tim bresnan who beat you 6-0 oh on the right hand yeah if you make fun with me i i make fun with you as well remember how tim beat you 6-0 i think uh derek wins
SPEAKER_02: because uh he went in bresnan yeah yeah so you are saying that derek is gonna beat morozov yeah okay yeah because derek wins uh tim bresnan if you ask him yeah about but did you know that tim bresnan just beat matt mask yeah but he beat him
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but he beat him not so easily. But Tim beat you very easy. So it looks like Matt is going to beat you as well. Matt, no. Tim beat Matt, but he also lost a round. And also, he won one round, I think, on fouls or something. But Tim beat you 6-0, no problem.
SPEAKER_02: looks like matt is stronger than you and he will beat you ah goodbye yeah you know when you pull when you pull team you were 90 kilo right 2015 yeah 90 kilo and now you're 180 and i have uh trouble with my shoulder injury
SPEAKER_00: I have a side pressure only 10 kilogram. Side pressure, 10 kilogram. Of course, I lose anybody. I lose anybody in their time. In 2015, I lose anywhere. Yeah, but remember what Ernest said a while ago, when you lose, you lose, you know, right? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: don't make excuses i have a question it was uh be it was in uh 2050. i know i know i know i have a question for you in your opinion if you didn't have the shoulder injury but you are 90 kilo 2015 you could be to kim resin if you didn't have shoulder problem yeah i can beat him uh i think i can't
SPEAKER_02: I can. I can. Even in 90 kilos in 2015? Yeah. I understand. Okay. Yeah. And what do you think, Hermes, Michael Todd versus Revas Lucidze? This is very, very interesting. I want... I want...
SPEAKER_01: Michael Todd restarted his winning match. You understand? Say again? I root for Michael because he lost many times. And he needs to win. Yes. For me, Revaz has only one possibility.
SPEAKER_01: If he says the technique, forbid the king move, he has a chance. The desperation move. The desperation move. But... Maybe Rebaz will win the first and the second match, but after... I think...
SPEAKER_00: Michael, yes. What do you think, Evgeny? Michael Todd wins. Michael Todd wins because Lewand Lutidze, when he fight... Last time? Last time? Fight last time, last time. I don't saw him, I don't saw him, but... With Lewand. With Lewand.
SPEAKER_02: With Levan, it was three and a half years ago. End of 2018. Not the end, but October. It was a good match. Good match, yeah. I think Michael Todd wins. I understand. Lukid has a bad wrist.
SPEAKER_02: but not strong wrist. It's better, it's good for Michael Todd. And what do you think about Samusha versus Paul Lin? Who? Samusha with? Paul Lin. Paul Lin. Paul Lin. Yeah, he beat Rambet. He just beat Rambet about like a few weeks ago.
SPEAKER_00: what's funny i don't know i don't remember pauline you don't remember pauline pauline gave a very hot match to john brzenk also ah uh without hair yeah without hair like michael to michael uh without hair
SPEAKER_02: also gave very hard time to john you know like i mean in the hook he gave him hard time he john even get a little bit injured you know when he pulled paul john says he is very strong i think uh wins samusha because i know him oh okay and do you do you do you know samusha hermes not much hermes do you know samusha i root for east
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay. I'm not asking who you root for. I'm just asking for analysis, but it looks like you don't know them. That's why. And how about Arif Ertem versus Krasimir? For me, I remember Arif, the last time he won very easily with Krasimir. Yes. With zero...
SPEAKER_01: zero zero resistance and for me 90 percent arif i don't know i don't know i think uh
SPEAKER_00: I think Gasparini wins. No, I think Krasimir Kostadinov. He's going to win? Yeah. I understand. He lost many times, Krasimir.
SPEAKER_01: And now he win. Now he maybe win. But I analyzed the last time and I remember Arif beat Krasimir very easily. And now I see the photo and the video of Arif. You pulling with Arif. What do you feel? He is very strong.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, in the first part, the first movement. He's very speedy and very powerful. And do you think Artem can win? He's very speedy, very powerful and for me,
SPEAKER_01: win a reef and they showed a photo i don't know but a reef is very good form i mean it is almost the same shape that he pulled against you but you took you you took his wrist you didn't let maybe maybe better now i show the photo that the arm is very
SPEAKER_02: very short i think i think not better but probably the same probably the same yeah yeah but you know he's he's whenever he pulled you his shape was good but looks like your your wrist was uh stronger you know here yeah but i was in good shape yeah he was very strong you know um
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so how about we talk about now the next things, you know. Evgeny, you have a supermatch with Matt and Tobias, then you have a supermatch in August against Todd Hutchings. So my question to you, if Todd,
SPEAKER_02: we didn't talk about tatashins versus iraqi come on this this is important because it is very you know like to me yeah a very very close match yeah what do you think for me i think iraqi take the risk
SPEAKER_01: But if he wins immediately, he wins. But if Todd stops the match in the center part, I think Todd wins. But does it matter where the match stops?
SPEAKER_02: If Todd stops here, and if Todd stops here, difference or no difference? Different. So if Todd puts his shoulder behind, then it's a problem. But if you catch him in the bicep like this, then maybe he wins? If Todd has this position, like this, he has a lot of power, but
SPEAKER_01: No shame in the centre, you understand? So he needs to have shoulder to shoulder... Yes, the shoulder, the head, the power. Yeah. And like, OK, you said that if like this and if like that, but how do you think who is going to win? Percent? Yeah. For me, 55, Irakli. Of 55, Irakli? 60, 60. For me, 60.
SPEAKER_02: So, you think that Irakli may win first? Yeah. Okay. And what do you think? Strap match. Strap match, yeah? I think the match will be the strap match. Yeah. Because Irakli's hand is not dominant without the strap. When the strap is put, then Irakli's hand is better because he is more likely dependent on his back pressure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And what do you think, Evgeny?
SPEAKER_00: I tried pulling with Irakli and I say Irakli wins because he can take wrist, Todd Hutchins, and after he has very, very strong side pressure.
SPEAKER_00: And Todd Hutchins can't stop it without wrist him. And Todd has, Todd slowly, he has easy start, not weekly. Irakli younger and he has,
SPEAKER_00: a great start he can take his wrist after start and after i think he has very good side pressure and he can win i understand i understand so uh my question for you my question for you if if iraqli wins against kata chings in may
SPEAKER_02: do you still want to pull tatashins or you want to pull uh someone else or uh i'm full uh with uh iraqli no no i mean you are gonna you are set with tatashins in august but if he loses
SPEAKER_02: do you want to still do you still think that you know you should you want to pull him or you want to pull someone else i'm just asking your opinion because we already promised that that you're gonna pull so unless you know he wants to pull someone else or something we need to set that much you know we are not gonna you and i are not gonna decide this you know because this is something between i
SPEAKER_02: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, And you Okay, we all need to agree to make a change, but if if somehow that loses you still want to pull kakashi's or you want to pull like. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Maybe. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I don't understand. First, Ted Hutchins, no, Ted Hutchins rests in May with Irakli, yeah? If Irakli wins, you still want to pull Ted Hutchins in August or someone else? Or with Irakli? No, no, because Irakli is set in August against John Brzezinski. Uh-huh.
SPEAKER_00: yeah and then i want i want you to pull also i want tatashins to pull and then maybe in august or maybe in december or i don't know i don't know i don't think about this i don't think about this we can talk about uh after fight uh in turkish okay okay okay i understand yeah yeah and then you can think about okay because i also have a time
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Like Iraq Lee is going to pull now pot. And if Todd beats Iraq Lee should Iraq is still pull John. These are all questions on my mind, you know, because I want to do a title match with the belt, with the belt here, you know? So I want to do like most like to focus on the winners to pull each other. But if, if, if majority of the people says that doesn't matter, the result of the may event,
SPEAKER_02: We still want to see these matches. And then, yeah, we need to do it. Maybe even before the match, we need to discuss you, I, John, Irakli, Taka, before the matches, because after the matches, the opinions may change. But before the match, we need to sit and say, if this match result this way, that way, any changes, but we need to decide all together.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think that Hermes, if they beat Gennady, do you think that Hermes and Dave should pull for the East vs. West title match? Evgeny? It's a question for me? Yes. Repeat, please.
SPEAKER_02: if the question is not asked to him he is not listening so i'm just saying that if if dave beats gennady do you think that dave and hermes should pull in august next match for the super heavyweight for the title belt uh-huh um okay super super i have a question uh the gasparini in may resident uh or not
SPEAKER_02: No, he's coming to Istanbul just to make you angry. He's going to be the massage guy for Matt Mask. Okay. I go for massage for Matt Mask. I'm the coach of Matt Mask. Yeah, he's going to be the trainer.
SPEAKER_01: I'm the trainer of Matt Mask. I'm in the corner with Matt Mask for massage. If you will be coach for Matt Mask, I will destroy you.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but you know, in Istanbul last time, remember, you a little bit pull at the dinner table with the... I felt zero power. You felt zero power, right? Zero, zero.

SPEAKER_01: You're only dreaming. You will see. You will feel. Calm down the reality. Okay, okay. Swim and pull, Hermes. Swim and pull. If you want, I show you my power in May. Little. Only 50%. You will feel my control over your arm.
SPEAKER_00: And will you beat him in hook? I will beat him in hook and in top roll. And side pressure too? Yeah. He laughed.
SPEAKER_02: but uh it's true okay okay one second now do you really believe that you can beat him really yeah yeah are you serious yeah isn't he too heavy for you that now he's near 130 kilo and then you are only like 108 kilo uh i don't scare a kilogram weight i don't care
SPEAKER_00: weight but can you be can you be like 115 kilo if you pull him possible 150 no no you you you 115 115. if i will be 150 it's uh one thousand percent i will i can beat him
SPEAKER_02: So 115, right? 1, 1, 5. 115 kilos. You'll beat him 1000%? Yeah. Wow. Hermes, is he serious or he's just like... Oh, only joke. He's joking? Okay. Yes, yeah. Look at the face, this face. Look at the face. Oh, okay. He speaks, but he doesn't...
SPEAKER_01: doesn't believe right yes he doesn't believe in the himself yeah only for the show but he don't believe this maybe he don't understand about uh he speak okay what i mean listen so ermas you're telling me that after this youtube program finish
SPEAKER_02: And then I write, Evgeny, okay, Evgeny, you and Hermes in November super match. And he will say, oh, no, no, Engin, I was just joking. This is what he will say. Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready. But I think Hermes Gasparini is scared. But I seem now, I speak same demon a rat.
SPEAKER_01: You are not in my level for the ranking. You are very down and I am very high. Before you start with another opponent and when you are near me, maybe we can challenge. Hermes, this is your dream. This is your dream. What do you say now?
SPEAKER_02: okay you don't know me wow whenever you said that devon saying all these things and at the beginning of the program you said that devon is running away from you and then now if you say these things like devon says if you say this to now uh
SPEAKER_01: but this this this thing is i believe with this the scale you know the ranking yeah understand and and just tell me if you are here where is where is uh prudnik me here prudik
SPEAKER_02: okay so what's the problem okay we will meet in november okay so what's the problem guys who are watching us who are watching us come on you all need to accept that my matchmaking uh ability to provocate the athletes and just making them accept is you know just
SPEAKER_02: Good, huh? Just look at that. We were just chatting friendly about East versus West. And now we are about to set a match in November between Rudnick and Hermes, you know. Anyways, so yeah, that would be good. You know, in Istanbul, we will talk. If you guys are serious, now on my mind for Evgeny, I want him to pull Matt Mask and then Tata Chings. After Matt Mask?
SPEAKER_02: with Gennady. This beautiful match. Between Prudnik and him? Yes. I understand, but there is Tatachins. We already said Tatachins in August. But I want him to pull also John Brzezinski. What do you think about Tatachins versus Prudnik? Ermes, honestly. I think Prudnik is too strong.
SPEAKER_00: You think he would win? Yes. And yeah. In the top row. And what do you think, Evgeny? You think you can comfortably beat? I think I can win him on the start in one second. And I can win him
SPEAKER_00: in hook in static slowly static one minutes or 30 seconds and i win oh yeah wow if you beat todd in a slow start hook yeah yeah i think if if i'm not mistaken like in a like a fresh match
SPEAKER_02: I mean, Zola one time beat him at the Zloty overalls, but it was overalls, so it's not like supermatch. I don't remember Todd losing in the starting match. I don't remember his losing. Rustam beats him, but very quickly, you know. But he's old-time. Yeah, yeah. Not old-time, but I think...
SPEAKER_00: but hutchins uh where uh don hutchins uh if he can uh where is it uh he win uh in hook uh andrea andrea andrea
SPEAKER_02: Sasha Andreev. He wins. He slowly cooks. Where is Rustam? Rustam only wins when he starts. Only when he starts. Okay, last question. What do you think about John and Prudnik?
SPEAKER_01: John is slowly getting stronger, I think, but still... Prudnik now is... Strong? Yeah, stronger. Yeah, Prudnik is so strong, he can even beat you, Hermes. But he's stronger, but another level. Another planet. Another planet. So 110 kilo and under, Prudnik is the best, huh? Is this what you're saying?
SPEAKER_01: yeah but whenever it's super heavyweight it is not a chance no chance right he should go down and 110 kilos he should almost yes it's better for him it's better yeah for your career is better if you he look at his face
SPEAKER_01: Very, very serious. He's better for his arm, for not having other injuries like this. If he wants to have a match with me, it's very dangerous for him, for his health. Health, health.
SPEAKER_01: You understand? No. No, he didn't understand. We don't understand. Yes, he said he didn't understand. Hermes, if you were 115 kilos and Rudnick is 115 kilos, could you still beat him?
SPEAKER_01: Then close, maybe? My pronator is too strong for Prudnik. Yeah, he cannot hook you, huh? I remember in 2013. Yes, you remember, Engie? Yes, yes, yes. My first lotto tour. 86 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: 86. And I took his wrist. But he won. In the strap. In the final. Yeah. But I'm in the semi-final. I was in the semi-final with Chesky and a long match, you remember.
SPEAKER_01: Chesky, Russian guy, Chesky with... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I know with the... And after this bruising, it's very... It's too fresh and I lose. Oh, that's why. Yes. And this is the true, the reality. This is the true story. The story, yes.
SPEAKER_01: but if he are near with me when he he we pulled in the in the restaurant i feed zero zero and if i fed something you mean right arm or left arm
SPEAKER_01: my left my right is double power oh yeah but but did you pull him with right arm or left arm left okay i understand right is more more stronger my yeah so you are basically saying that if you would pull him
SPEAKER_01: You would hold him and lift him up from the table like this? Yes, he coming my side, my past. With whole body or only the arm? Whole body. Look at his face. If I start like this, only back pressure, whole body behind me. Finish the match.
SPEAKER_00: Evgeny, did you hear that? Yeah? Is that true? Evgeny, can he do that? I think he joke. No, no, my friend. No, no. If you want, I show you. A little. Okay. Okay. You can think I'm scared. Okay. You can think.
SPEAKER_00: yeah you can think what i say now uh early early when we was in one weight i beat you and now i can beat you if you wait more if you will be wait uh have weight more than me i can beat you did you understand
SPEAKER_02: No, I don't understand. He said that in the same way. Now I can beat you. But he said that even now, even you more weight, he can still beat you. Your weight won't save you. Your weight won't save you. Stop dreaming, my friend. Stop dreaming. Listen, listen. In Istanbul, we will sit down and then we will negotiate about the supermatch. And then, if you guys...
SPEAKER_02: don't accept no you then no whenever we negotiate about the supermatch we'll put the camera there and then if you don't accept i'm gonna put on youtube yeah look look at this face yeah he's a good actor
SPEAKER_01: oh yeah i know i know good actor yeah yeah yeah his job he yes yes yes i showed the the the the the the the xenography is very good actor yes now every time he's acting yeah yeah he's now acting like he's not scared right yeah he's brave right yeah
SPEAKER_02: okay listen one last time i am asking you again would you really pull this guy and beat him really but last time i'm asking you then if yes i i will i will arrange a super match but if you think that you know he is 130 kilo it's normal he's 130 you're 108 maximum you will be 112 13. it's a big difference
SPEAKER_02: So if you don't pull him, it's normal. You know, I wouldn't. I mean, because he's much weight difference. But this is he don't have a respect for the ski for the ranking. What do you understand? What do you mean? Yeah. So he thinks that he can beat you. And this is not this is no, no respect. No.
SPEAKER_00: He is scared. He's just scared now. He's scared. Look at him. He can't do anything. He's going to compete with other people, not directly with me. I'm very strong. I don't direct with Lewandowski. Before I have another match, they were like this. After Lewandowski.
SPEAKER_02: He must win before Levan and after me. I'm Levan for Prusik. You understand, Engie? I'm Levan for Prusik. I understand, but still, you know, you can go and do good training. No change. No change. Good training, no preparation. No, no, no. If you think, really, it's not your level, then just go there. Okay, yeah, yeah. Take some thousands of dollars to your pocket and go away.
SPEAKER_01: Or are you really scared? No, no. But if I compete and I train, I want to go up in the ranking, you understand? No wish out of ten of ranking.
SPEAKER_02: oh okay you don't want to spend time with me i don't have a time for these people i don't have a time with these people this guy have no respect for you do you hear what he says he said he doesn't have time for you he said that you are not top 10.
SPEAKER_00: I understand. He's just scared, I think. That's all. He's just scared. He says that you need to beat other guys to be qualified to pull him. He says you need to beat Gennady and this and that. He thinks I will beat Levon Seginashvili and after I can rest with him.
SPEAKER_02: No, not that far. But still, you know, he thinks that you need to beat Gennady and you need to beat other guys. And then he thinks that, you know, then you can pull him. I can beat Kurdesha and I can beat after can rest with Hermes because he lost Kurdesha. How about, how about, Evgeny, you pull Alex Kurdesha and then you beat Alex and then tell Hermes
SPEAKER_02: Hey, you need to beat Alex to come to me, you know. No, because in August I beat Dave and I'm all up. You go up in your dream. Listen, Evgeny, can he beat... What do you think about Dave Chaffee and Hermes, who wins? Dave Chaffee, Hermes? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: uh i now i think dave chief here because he has a very great wrist and fingers and uh level or level um high arm high arm like uh kurdisha oh
SPEAKER_02: They don't have a long arm. But I think they're longer than Hermes. Longer. I think they have the same height. Same. Alex is, I think, two meters. Even more than two meters. Yes, more. Two meters, ten. Ten? No, not ten. Probably three or something. How many centimeters do you have? Me?
SPEAKER_01: What? Your height. Your height. Your height. Which? Your height. Your height. How tall are you? 189. 89.
SPEAKER_00: And you? I am too, 189. Impossible. I'm more higher than you. I think 119 or 90. No, no, no. Yeah. I have the photo with Dave in Dubai. Same height, same arm. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: he he can beat him why why are you loud loud hanging because because on the on the comments on the on the youtube comment here because he asked you how many something how many yeah okay you ask you know what he's asking you know and then people people are laughing at that so
SPEAKER_00: Okay, just say, Evgeny, who wins, Dave Chaffee or Hermes? I think Hermes Gasparini lose Kurdecha, Kurdecha lose Dave Chaffee, and so what?
SPEAKER_00: uh what equation but to me i don't know about i'm going to see the court teacher wins the gasparini uh but uh the chief wins cordisha and the chief who is gasparini yeah but but ermes yeah evgeny these things never change it always goes like this maybe like ms now maybe gain weight he's stronger also different styles
SPEAKER_02: make different i'm i'm already maybe maybe maybe a mess go up his level little so so they win so this is basically you are saying they but it is not help him what he said that is not help him not help
SPEAKER_02: He says that you make your level high enough to beat Dave. Dave will still beat you, he says. We see, we see. I think 50-50, but they were very strong, very strong. 50-50. I understand. Evgeny, if you pull now, we have...
SPEAKER_02: you are second time coming to Istanbul for East versus West. Your first opponent was super heavyweight, Morozov, 130 kilo. And now your second opponent, I think he gained some weight. He's a little bit more than 115 kilo. He will be under 16 or something, still over 110 kilo. You will have match. If you would pull in the future,
SPEAKER_02: super heavyweight, who would you want to pull? Seriously, now we talk about Hermes, you, but it doesn't have to be. Is there anyone that in the super heavyweight you want to pull? If I said you in the East versus West, who do you want to pull? Seriously, Hermes or Kurdesha or Gennady or Michael Todd, you can pull maybe someone like Michael Todd. Devon Larratt. Devon Larratt, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: think devon if devon is like how big he is now he would i think he would be too much for uh prudny but if they come to the similar weight then then then that's possible do you think i think very great very great uh this is the one larat or uh uh rms gasparini it's very great you want to see them
SPEAKER_02: for me it is great for me you want to pull them or you want them to pull each other uh for me uh with me or uh or uh okay okay okay yeah i think i think larat now focus on the uh levan and after levan he wants to rest for some time so i think that we should uh focus more
SPEAKER_02: know other than him right now right now we don't know who is gonna pull after levan we don't know anything but um so you want to if if not devon then you want to pull hermes i think yeah uh or rms or day long it's very great opponent for me yeah and i i can prepare i can uh
SPEAKER_02: very uh i must to prepare and i must will be uh very strong uh training yeah for this match but do you do you realize that hermes doesn't want to pull you because he says that you are not top 10 now he said that you need to beat someone else to pull him you know he says that you are not at his level now
SPEAKER_00: This information tell me only Hermes Gasparini. Okay. So if Hermes says no, then who do you want to pull? I am third place in top eight.
SPEAKER_00: and gasparini uh eight uh eight place in top eight don't or don't use it all the time now 20 22 year
SPEAKER_00: is four years and i i i can't i uh don't wrestling because i wait to pay it uh and my uh rating down but not power my rating down but my power yes strong okay see hermes he has he has good points he says that his ranking went down because he didn't pull anyone
SPEAKER_02: but he said that the guy that took eighth place, where he took third place, he said that he beat you. So he says that, you know, you are underestimating him. No, now I'm serious. I think Prudik, he's...
SPEAKER_01: I want to see him with Gennady or... Or... Kurdejtsev. Or Kurdejtsev. Okay, I can wrestle with Kurdejtsev and after, if I win... But it's more interesting with Gennady. Gennady.
SPEAKER_00: very good and after with you yeah if i win and after i must rest with gordicha and after with gennady and after is if i win uh only with you maybe maybe you know now now now okay i understand now i officially officially i understand that
SPEAKER_02: Hermes Gasparini is scared of. OK, my friends. OK. After Gennady Kurdeca. No, no, no. Not both of them. One of them. One of them. After Gennady. OK. If he pulls Gennady, and if he beats Gennady, then you're going to pull him. Deal? Yeah. See, now this is recorded live on YouTube. Yes, my friend.
SPEAKER_00: okay okay i checked okay okay that's good that's good if i can win gennady i can win that mess uh one thousand percent why and mess with gennady uh it's uh it was uh early so his his win
SPEAKER_02: against Gennady early, some months ago. Now Gennady is stronger. It doesn't count. But how about Kurdesha? Do you think that Kurdesha may be stronger than three years ago? Because you said that you were third, Kurdesha was seven or eight. You are giving an example from three years ago to prove that how good you are.
SPEAKER_00: But you are saying that Hermes wins five months, six months ago. And now Gennady is stronger now, today, than early when Hermes was pulling with him. Me always shame. Maybe now Gennady can beat Hermes Gasparini now.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe also Kurdesha is stronger now than top eight. Yeah, now stronger. Yeah, because you said that you were third place at top eight, Kurdesha was seven, eight, but now he can be also stronger. Yeah, that's what I wanted to say. But I have third place in top eight and this is fact.
SPEAKER_02: this is four years ago okay four years but my power uh now oh three 2019 18 19 19 20 21 22 no no he wasn't in 18 he was in 2019 ah uh 2019 in december
SPEAKER_00: In December, this is 2020. This is all one, two years ago. One more. But now in December, 1.5 years ago. No, no, no, no, 2.5. Two years ago, three years ago. Anyways, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so the last last subject, if we come, what do you guys think about Levan and Devon? Devon Larratt? And Levan. I think Levan, because Levan, Levan, Levan, Levanovich. Levan is too strong. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And I think Leiva... I hope a little war. But for me it's the same... when Devon pulled with Denis Tsiplenko.
SPEAKER_02: Is it too much different weight? But but don't you think that Devon now is stronger, much stronger than that time? Yes, now, now. How weight now Devon Larratt? 130? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
SPEAKER_02: 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 60 kilo. Difference weight. 60. No, no, 50, 50. He's 180, other one is 130. No, 190. No, only last week I did interview with him, he said he was 180. He wants to go 190. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: but larat has a very great technique and uh no limit endurance endurance endurance yeah very great endurance and very great technique
SPEAKER_00: And I think Levan Signashvili wins two rounds and after we will see. And after we will see. And after Larratt can stop him after two rounds. Do you think it's possible? No.
SPEAKER_00: it's a little chance but i think it's possible because larata very great technique and more endurance when you say great technique you're talking about this it is and he has a very great uh raised and now he 130. uh-huh
SPEAKER_02: on harris and he has the very power in an angle for his angle so okay evgeny you have ten thousand dollars and you will gamble you will bet you have money you put this ten thousand dollars to levan or to devon
SPEAKER_00: maybe live on maybe they won i think they won the one has uh more percent for win and more power but i believe in uh uh devon larat he can uh if he stops the match if he stops the match because of very good endurance
SPEAKER_00: He has chance to win. Yeah. Okay. But Levan Zaginashvili has more percent for win. I understand. And Ermes, you? Levan. Levan have too much...
SPEAKER_01: power in the back pressure. And with the strap, you know, the technique is not very important. The strap match. And how do you see the match will happen? Can you show us how Lewand will win with the side pressure? Lewand will win with the top one? Maybe maybe Larate take
SPEAKER_01: a little risk of lebanon like like this but the lebanon continue continue his way and go down and do you think that he will also take that devon's wrist whenever he do this yeah so they will may lose his wrist as well you think yes yeah okay i understand i showed the video of uh lebanon with
SPEAKER_01: Dave Chaffee. And Dave Chaffee, he do nothing with Levan. And now, Levan, he told me he go with the best shape ever. He is the best shape.
SPEAKER_01: Levan told you? Yeah, two months ago. He wants to go in the best shape. I understand. Because the match for him is very important for the curriculum, for his career. And another question. What do you think about if La Lettine and Sheffy push?
SPEAKER_02: I think that we did that outside pulling. Sheffield also has some chance in this step. Do you think it's possible or not, Hermes? For me, they would win. They would beat La Lecce? Yes. Yeah, because Le Mans is not so dominant. Like this, but putting inside pressure. So much.
SPEAKER_01: Horse power, right? This way. Yes. But do you think... I'm very curious. I'm very curious to match me with this. Because I think I have a good possibility to take this risk. And after this, I want to see... I want to see...
SPEAKER_02: how the match will be. I think that if the match starts, if Lallatin cannot control his wrist against Dave, if the wrist stays straight, I think that Dave can win with the side pressure. But if, because Lallatin has a very tall arm, if he can control here, then maybe Dave cannot beat Dave.
SPEAKER_01: the pronators to put side pressure if laletin controls here i think i think it's gonna win if you control but if the wrist say like flat it's very it's very same and very interesting because it's a very same level yeah yeah yeah it's very minimum particular minimum part yes yes
SPEAKER_02: The difference of the match is very little part of the start of a wrist like this. David has more horsepower, while Laletin is more technical about the hand control, wrist control. But if he cannot control his own wrist, Laletin is going to lose, in my opinion. What do you think about Laletin and David? Laletin has a very great start.
SPEAKER_00: yeah he is quickly yeah and i think uh this is will be this side this is well will decide okay speed uh starts it's very important in this much important important but when the strap is on and then before the goal if you can tight here it can kind of sometimes stop the speed right yeah
SPEAKER_00: Like, Kurdesha was faster than Dave. Kurdesha hit, but he also wasn't able to... Kurdesha, bad start. Not right vector. Not right vector attack, I think, for Dave Chaffee. Not right vector.
SPEAKER_00: Can you show me? If right vector and the speed quickly and right way vector, I think Laletin can beat. Yeah, I understand. Anyway, so I think that, you know, we can we can finish it and then I see you guys both of you next week.
SPEAKER_02: And Phil, if you are still there, my friend, can you again share Hermes' YouTube channel's link before we close? And I will ask the guys if they want to add anything more to say. And then, yeah, we can. Hermes, we are finishing. We see you next week. And then do you want to say anything, the last words you want to say, anything you want to say?
SPEAKER_01: The last words is for you, because this event is very, very big event in the history. I don't show the same event. And it's very good for the sport from our blessing, no?
SPEAKER_01: And for an organisation, this event is very difficult, I don't know, but it's not simply to organise this big event. And good job, my friend. Thank you for being part of it. And I hope to see you next time as a competitor, but this time
SPEAKER_01: as a trainer of Matt Mask, right? Yes. I'm in the corner with Matt Mask and I prepare the gel, ice, elastic band for good warm-up. And tactics? Yes. And you lose with him. Wow. What? And you lose with him.
