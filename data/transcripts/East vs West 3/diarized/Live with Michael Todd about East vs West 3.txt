Engin Terzi: My friend, I have 11 WAP world titles in seniors. I also have a master's world titles, but I don't count them together with seniors. And I also have Zloty title and I also have world wrist wrestling championships from Petaluma, California. I competed only once in 1997. There was 10 weight classes and I won half of them, five of them. I was only 61 and a half kilo.
Engin Terzi: It was 135 pounds category and I won up to 80 kilo. I mean, Larry is coming to do East versus West. I think I, Larry, Adam, you know, we will just sit down and talk about, you know,
Engin Terzi: like about this events, I don't see anyone as an opponent, you know, as long as the organizers offer matches to do top athletes, I'm fine with it. As long as outlets are, um, Michael just said that.
Unknown: Zoom may not be supported on your browser. I don't know. I don't know what to say. Maybe I should tell him, can you try different browser?
Engin Terzi: um no i don't think so i i'm not i didn't i don't know anything about you zola evans are coming you know i plan to yes i am planning to share oh yeah michael k
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Hello, Michael. How are you? I'm well, young man. How are you doing? Good, good. Good to see you, my friend. I was just chatting with the people in the chat while waiting for you. So how is everything? It looks like you did some last heavy training or something. Well, OK, so I do have. I end up the bench press the other night. Like, I don't know what you call it.
Michael Todd: pulled out a rib and it trapped my trap. So it messed up my shoulder, shoulder, shoulder, not right shoulder.
Michael Todd: i've been hurting a little bit but i went got physical therapy yesterday and i just went to uh i just went to chiropractor and he got me back feeling good so i still have to do my amrap with deadlifts today which eight weeks ago was 455 for 10 four weeks ago was 495 for 11 and today's gonna be 545 so i'm gonna see if i can't get eight to ten at 5 45 which would be huge for me and then i've got a strict overhead press workout
Michael Todd: i just got some d load high volume blood flow so my last workout will be sunday but yeah feel good feel great um shoulder you still did 545 deadlifts i'll do it today oh you will do it but don't you think that you may even hurt more you don't you think what happened was it was a pressing movement that that knocked the rib out yeah and so i talked to my physical therapist and he didn't think pulling would hurt it
Michael Todd: okay go ahead and do your pulling workout today if you feel any pain stop um and then by tomorrow i should be able to do my strict overhead press workout but
Michael Todd: But I don't know. I'm enjoying, you know, I used to lift heavy all the time anyway. Yeah. And I enjoy that type of training. And I'm going to tell you that those seated curls and strict curls, the way that handle is, it's almost like I grip it like this. Yeah. It's for my knuckle, my riser to stay engaged. Yeah. So I feel much, much better not having a wild. So we'll see. Yeah. Yeah. Yep.
Michael Todd: yeah i don't know i don't know you you you really need you really need that win and make a comeback yeah i mean if i want to be relevant if i want to be relevant then i definitely need to win you know if i'm i'm just enjoying competition you know just be the best i can be whatever happens happens but you know me me not not
Michael Todd: having a goal of being among the very best in the world doesn't sit real well with me. So I'm expecting Rivas to be a very tough opponent. Looking at him and sparring with İrakli, he looked better than I did. I just think I'm in much better form now than I was then. And I think it'll go on, you know, at the event. So we'll see. Did you watch any part of Rivas' interview? Because he said that he lifted very heavy
Engin Terzi: And after the training, he pulled with İrakli. So he might be better than what we saw. But I think that, you know, like... I'm going to be... Sorry. Yeah, it's okay. I shouldn't have opinion, but I can't say, like, who's going to win or something. But I think that his chance is, like, for a, if possible, a quick win, you know. Other than that, I don't... I'm not sure if he has the endurance or...
Engin Terzi: Genadi, and if he knows how to pull, how to deal with your open arm top roll, and if your shape is better than last time,
Michael Todd: And then who knows, you know, maybe you versus Genadi would be different this time if you guys would pull. Honestly with you, I would love to run that back match. So if I'm successful next week and there's a promoter that wants to see that match happen, or I might bring Genadi here. I want to avenge that loss. He's an awesome guy. He pulled very smart. I just don't think he pulled...
Engin Terzi: the version of me that can't exist, right? I think my best beats his best, in my opinion. But I have to prove that, you know? Yes, yes, yes. But still, you know, it would be better, you know, if you would just wait a year or something, you know, then it would take more attention, you know, if the match is not that close. But, of course, you decide that if you are going to organize it over there. Yeah. I honestly would like to call Dave.
Michael Todd: I'd like to pull Dave over here, you know? Yeah. If Dave is successful against Genadi, prior to me, instead of me trying to get a rematch with Genadi, I'd like to just pull Dave since Dave's got the win on Alex. And Dave's a guy I think would want to pull me again. You know, I think he'd want to have a good performance against me. Because every time we talk about Dave, people say that, but he can't beat Michael. So I think that he would also like to change
Engin Terzi: that that that uh i'll say yeah yeah yeah and yeah so i think yeah it would be good for me uh i also started doing my own ranking world ranking and for me people says that okay how are you gonna rank people you know if this guy be that guy that guy be this guy this guy with that guy i mean for me the answer is simple you know the recent result matters the most
Engin Terzi: I mean, if you are pulling with the number four guy, Michael, if you're beating him, you're taking his spot, you know, and then you're putting him one down, you know, I don't understand like how it is like going like by five, six places down just because he loses the guy. I mean, if you beat the guy, you're ranking above him and he just goes one spot below, you know, this is how mine will work. Right. Yeah. And and.
Engin Terzi: What's the difference from the Michael that we saw in two previous right-hand matches than the Michael that we're going to see in Istanbul? Can you tell us what is exactly, other than the numbers, in a technical explanation, is there anything different except that you have more power?
Michael Todd: Okay, so the Devin match, I really don't have an answer for that. At the time, I felt like Devin was just amazing. But the thing that keeps coming back to me is 10 days before I pulled Devin, I had my last training session with Corey, and I was killing him. Eight days after I pulled Devin, no injuries, no nothing. I come back home, and I can't budge Corey out of the center of the table. I mean, I didn't start a good movie.
Michael Todd: So I'm like, maybe Devin wasn't that great. And I just had, you know, overtaxed the central nervous system feature. I don't know. I don't know. I have no real explanation for that other than Devin had a great performance and I did not. Now with Genadi, I tried to get as big as I could, knowing that in the past,
Michael Todd: a bigger bloated version of me mentally i don't like myself that much i don't feel good i mean i want to look good i just i want to feel good i want to look good i want to be an athlete and i was in pretty good shape up until around december like i was like close to 300 pounds still had abs looking pretty good but then i just i fell off my nutrition and i was off for like three months i just could not motivate myself to eat right i was justifying eating like because i was going to be bigger
Michael Todd: Well, the problem with that was, yes, I was big. Everybody's like, Michael's huge, blah, blah, blah. But I kind of took Devin's advice and I didn't do any heavy training for four months. I just tried to be healthy. So I did, I had no, nothing that I had done in my training to make me believe that I was stronger than I had previously been. Other than the fact that my arms were bigger, my chest was bigger. I was bigger. Right.
Michael Todd: and i had found a lane that worked against corey like corey can beat a lot of people in a hook we just saw that with crossy but i was beating corey in a hook something well if i can beat corey in the hook i can get anybody in the hook so i quit trying to do like how i needed to attack ganadi would have been just straight back pressure and pull the height yeah instead sideways with back pressure i gotta stop he controlled the height and out back pressure me you know
Michael Todd: That was a mental error, I mean that was an error on my part, but it's also extremely good arm wrestling on his part. What I expect to be different now is I will not, I mean even if I think I'm capable of flash pinning Revaz, which I don't know if I can, I'm not even going to try.
Michael Todd: You're not going to try. No, I'm going to control this dude. I'm going to get the match where I need it to be. If it's possible, I'm going to get the match where I need it to be. And I'm going to let this guy work himself into fatigue. Listen, I was hated for winning because of a Kings move. I was hated. The most hated guy in the sport of arm wrestling, when I wasn't trying to be hated, I was just trying to be me, right? Yeah. It really affected me.
Engin Terzi: So I tried not to be that guy. And then I got hated for losing. So if I'm going to be hated, I'm going to be hated for winning. You know what I'm saying? I understand. Yeah, but like, do you think that you were hated? Like even when your shoulder was not below the pad level?
Michael Todd: yes because who can be who can be against that you know like it's just like it's all open i'm top roll you know it's just like this and somebody's gonna post on that match that i'm the under tabler all i do is land on floor i mean it's out there it's never gonna go away right so
Michael Todd: any match he doesn't matter i can shoulder press you and somehow i'm cheating you know what i'm saying like so i'm i'm okay with it i'm just gonna do whatever it takes to win hopefully i do get the w and i get to move on to my next match but i i'm i'm no longer trying to be what everyone else wants me to be i'm gonna be who i want to be and be the best version of me i can be
Engin Terzi: Um, did you, did you, uh, read the, the rules that I posted on the, the, the East versus West rules? I was a little surprised that because there's no organization in the world that is, if you drop humors at a decline, you're immediately fouled, but yet you chose to do that. It was a little surprising, but I don't care. I mean, I mean, I mean, as, as, as long as you are like this, this is okay.
Engin Terzi: But whenever you go like this, this is that, that, that you gain advantage by, by posting extra, like using your, who matters like a lever, you know, but as long as yeah. But you're the only organization in the world that immediately. Yeah. Yeah. No, this year is changing this. Oh, did they? Yeah, no, they are changing now. They, they, they, they have the, yeah, I will ask them because they, they should be in the, uh, Congress that is done. I didn't go to Romania.
Michael Todd: the european championship because yeah because there is a there is a reason for that yeah i didn't know if you were doing it to appease the fans or because some like waft switched the rules
Michael Todd: Because sometimes you want your event to be seen, you want people to watch it, you want them to enjoy it. So you try to make those that are fan friendly, right? Yeah. But it is, I don't care. You just tell me what the rules are and I'm going to arrest them. I already wrote. Yeah. Like, I mean, when you say like people, I mean, people for the fans or something, you know, I don't think that the majority likes to see such thing anyways. Um, so.
Engin Terzi: So what you are saying that, okay, if you beat Rivas, are you interested to, you know, just continue to, like, pull in anytime soon after that? And if yes, like, are you going to pull, like, day? But how about to pull over here? Do you have any? Whether I beat Rivas or not, I pull Todd Hutch in July 9th. That's my idea, right? Yeah.
Michael Todd: Yes, I want to be active. I hate not competing. I love training, but I need to compete. I'm a competitor, you know what I'm saying? Like I gotta find out where I'm at.
Michael Todd: So the problem, and it's not a problem, I am blessed beyond measure. But my schedule between doing the different things I do with Redcon and some of the other partners I have, my schedule is slammed with fitness expos, beat the champ appearances. I'm like, it's just a very busy, busy schedule. Yeah, I understand, yeah. And Beck and I are doing our photo shoot. We're doing our fitness challenge right now. So we're going to Vegas August 14th.
Michael Todd: through August 19th, and we're gonna do our fitness photo shoot, our fitness challenge, all that stuff. So East versus West four, even if I win against Rivas, I don't know your date, and I don't know if I could make it. August 6th. 6th. I probably could make that. And just saying that if you'd be Drevas, who would you want to boot? Alex. Alex Grilesha. Yeah. Okay, I will ask him.
Michael Todd: That's who I'd like to arm wrestle. If it's an easy guy. It could be anybody, but Alex is a guy who I like Alex. That kid is extremely powerful. He's probably the future of arm wrestling, but I think I can beat him. I like how he arm wrestles. I like what he does, but I think I can stop the match. I think that you had this idea right after you saw his match versus Davit that it's possible to do that. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: yeah i understand that i understand and you know that i asked him to pull you and in east versus west and he said that you know engine i need to a little bit train more and you know get better you know before i pull again he said and so that's why he needed more time otherwise like he would be pulling you in east versus west now uh west three yeah yeah yeah
Michael Todd: Well, you got me on it. Revaz is a good dude. And I like that guy. Yeah. But I'm strong too. Ever since I watched him crack LeBron's wrist back at that WAF event, I was like, damn, that's a bad dude, you know? Yeah. Did you see his training pool with Genadi? Yeah. Yeah. When Genadi tried to top roll him, he was beating him like this. Yeah. Yeah. Very impressive. Yeah. Very impressive.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I will not be surprised if he gets the hand wrist advantage against you with the start. The question is, can he pin you? If he can't, can he do that three times? That is the, you know, the... I'm going to be honest. My objective is to keep him from taking my hand and wrist.
Michael Todd: With back pressure, with a very strong riser and a lot of pressure. That's my intention. So that when he goes sideways, he buckles his wrist. That's my intention. Whether or not I pull it off or not, I'll find out, but that's what I want to do. I don't want to be arm wrestling from here. I want to be arm wrestling from here, you know? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. You need to stop from there. Oh, a lot harder. You know what I'm saying? I don't want to have to. I know.
Engin Terzi: Maybe you were tired, though. That's why you just wanted to, the more you felt stronger, the more you wanted to go sideways and finish the matches quickly. But that wasn't the thing that made you great. Stopping my opponents. For me, and so much of my arm wrestling is mental.
Michael Todd: is at the world class level in the last decade plus, I've been the guy that's always been the underdog. So in my mind, if I can ready go and I can hit to the rear of the pad and stop their side pressure, their offensive surge,
Michael Todd: and the match stops in my mind, I'm gonna win that match because now I deserve to be there. I've stopped the match. I've proven that I'm at their level and something just took over. And there was a different mindset, different person. And then I got to where I won a lot. Then the expectations of me winning were really high. And then I needed to win in a certain fashion. And it just, I let the pressure get to me, I think. So now I'm just getting back to enjoying myself.
Michael Todd: I'm obviously going to try to win, but I'm just having fun. And I think by the fact that I don't have as much pressure and I'm allowing myself to have fun again, I'm going to get a lot more victories. I think. I understand. Michael, you have seen the card, you know, East versus West card. And you, like the American team,
Engin Terzi: john bersink yourself dave chaffee and pat hutchings marcio barboza pauline uh derek simit uh this is like with maybe a few you know guys missing but probably as good as it can get right from the north america like if there was devon and jerry and yeah maybe yeah and then then then free west in that mix
Engin Terzi: Corey West's strong right now. Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah. He's right here. He's right here, yeah. And when is his match with John? July? July. Same time I pulled Todd Hutchings. Wow. I don't know how his wrist feels, but if John cannot take the wrist or at least keep it like a neutral flat, if John, if Corey bends that wrist quickly as he did,
Engin Terzi: others yeah i think he's gonna he's gonna yeah okay so here's the question hypothetically let's say corey is able to do that and he's able to defeat john what does that mean for corey i mean styles make matches you know john's hook inability lately if he controls john's tornado and just beat him quickly i mean that that is going to make him very dangerous that like many people only only people who will have
Engin Terzi: I still think that someone like Hermes Gasparini has better hand, wrist, and top roll than John right now. Yeah, so I don't know if, like, if Corey beats John right now, for sure he's going to be in top 10, but probably like maybe 7, 8, somewhere there, in my opinion. Right. But that's a question about those really super heavyweights. John? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, is great for his weight class at this age, but I don't think that he can be competitive in the really super heavyweight elite like top five top six around there like Dave chaffee or. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Latin or Devon or live on you know it just kind of.
Michael Todd: uh something that he passed already it's still incredible at the age of 58. what is spectacular what john brzenk has done since he's came back has been nothing sort of spectacular um but i do have a lot of uh confidence in corey's potential whether or not ready to beat someone like john i think he's i think it's honest to god i think it's 50 50.
Michael Todd: I think there's a 50% chance that Corey beats. He's just too much. He's too much in the hand and wrist, and John can't find a way out. I think there's a 50% chance that he cannot get out. I think there's a 50-50 chance that he cannot. Oh, okay, okay, okay. And you know that that's the only way. Yeah. If he doesn't get back, he's not beating him.
Michael Todd: In my opinion, I mean, in my opinion, I don't think John's shoulder stability would hold up to just a grinder inside with Corey. I just don't think so. Or side pressure. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, Corey is like a train, you know, with the start, you know. Dude, we measured his wrist the other day. Yeah. Ten and a quarter inches. Yeah. I couldn't believe it. Yeah. That kid's crazy. Someone who is really hitting –
Engin Terzi: hard with the supination to his pronator very quick and very powerful may stop his side pressure i think that as as todd hashings did it i don't think that you can stop him by with like a like a defensive way i think you need to hit him before he hits you that is my opinion i don't know how many people can can also
Michael Todd: Would love to see that Todd Hutchings, Corey West match ran back. People think that was the other day. That was six months ago. That was six months ago, and I was on tour, and all Corey did was weight train. He never went to a practice. I mean, it's his fault. He just never went to a practice. He just wanted to be gym strong. But the one thing that wasn't his fault, the tables were supposed to be standard 7x7 elbow pads, and they showed up, and they were 7x9 WL pads.
Michael Todd: So Todd had two more inches to back pressure, right? The other thing is Jim Coyle designed those tables after a table that Jane Smith built years ago. And you know how the corners of the table scratch your free arm when you're arm wrestling? Yeah. They cut the corners off. By cutting the corners off, they moved the legs in three inches on each side. So Corey couldn't fit inside the table. He couldn't get his body inside the base the way he's normally set up.
Engin Terzi: I personally believe if you run that back match back with WAF rules and, uh, Igor Mizrenko standard table, I think Corey beats him. I really do. Yeah. We don't know though, but I don't know who would be the proper, like good opponents from East for, uh, for him. If you guys would come together on, uh, in August, I don't know. Dimitri Salaya. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: that's a bad dude yeah that that that that may be really really high level start for uh corey it is but i would love to see it they're both huge both huge and they are very explosive at the start they both are right right like mostly about really good starting right yeah but sly is very fast as well and corey is incredibly fast for his size you know he's just i mean
Michael Todd: very quick you know he's moved right to the pin pad is yeah wait anyway so see him in person he looks but when you see him in person yeah he's enormous
Michael Todd: Like, he is so big around. Yeah. And his head is so big. Like, he literally looks like a gorilla. He's enormous. Yeah, huge, yeah. I would love to see him and LeVon stand next to each other just to see frames. Because honestly, LeVon is an enormous human being. But if you ask me, Corey has a bigger frame. And I'll tell you why. How tall is she? He's about a half inch taller than me. So about 6'3 and a half. Oh, OK.
Michael Todd: At 11 years old, he was 6'3", 330. At 11. So he was 145, 147, no, he was 150 kgs. 150 kgs and 6'3", at 11 years old. But how come he was 6'3", at 11, and never get taller than that?
Michael Todd: don't know he just never grew i mean he hit his growth spurt early um are you serious i never heard such thing that you are till 11 you you get tall and then you stop till like you grow up what happened is his torso from his waist up is about the size the length of a six foot eight guy but he only has like a 30 inch inseam so his legs are not that long i think
Michael Todd: i think he was supposed to be taller his legs just didn't grow into his brain but i'm saying that if we go back and look at 10 years ago or longer and you look at lebanon and he's 85 90 kg his frame is not as big as cory's he's in a huge huge huge human being yeah yeah yeah frames i think corey's bigger so you are saying that he is naturally a big guy you know and kind of kind of got bigger in a later stage yeah yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: that's just my opinion i mean i i like them both i understand i understand yeah there may be a problem there may be a problem setting in with the uh uh with the russian guy the quick guy that you mentioned and yeah because because the the the old international federations you know uh for now they don't allow the uh russian team russian athletes to compete internationally i i really hope that this this stupid war
Engin Terzi: finishes and everything just happens, you know, as it should be. And then, then, you know, we can be united again. I agree. Cause if, if, if a reef beats Crossey, which I'm, I'm picking him to win, if he beats Crossey, a reef and Corey may be a good match. Yeah, I agree. I agree. Yeah. Yeah. I will ask. Yeah, we, we will be all there. We all will be there. You know, we can, we can, we can discuss about it. We can just sit down and just, you know,
Michael Todd: decide, you know what to do. And then we can talk, we can talk, you know, with Alex, if he's available for the August and, you know, just, just about right now, focus on winning. You have an opponent to be. I'm about to take this guy lightly. He's way bigger than me. He's way bigger than me. He's way longer than me. And I suspect with me coming off two losses, he's pretty confident that he can beat me. So, um,
Engin Terzi: wasn't he wasn't i told him yeah he wasn't he i think i don't exactly remember what he said but he said like maybe like 50 50 he said this is like 50 50 yeah this is but he said that he said that he in his life never taken uh arm wrestling super seriously he said that because of his size and structure you know he said that he believes that he has so much potential to be very dangerous and
Engin Terzi: He said that now, you know, is his goal to beat Levan. He said that there has been a time that it was Levan's goal to beat him. And now this is his dream to beat him. He said they are very, very good friends. They are all day together all the time. And but he said that this time he is serious.
Engin Terzi: and he's targeting Levan. So I am sure that he knows what he's talking about because he's not like sitting somewhere far from Levan and just dreaming, but he probably knows his own potential. So I won't be surprised if someone like Revaz to get much, much stronger
Michael Todd: then how he is now and then be a threat in the future to the other athletes because right now we don't see many people that you know like a future hope you know to become the best in the world yeah i mean uh especially since fatali can't be active right now we really don't know where match is at i would like to see it again because it was very competitive round one in my opinion um
Michael Todd: And we thought, okay, no disrespect, because I love the guy. We thought Alex might be the next threat. Yeah. But after all of it, what I saw was Alex's hand and wrist and lever are amazing. Yeah. But he doesn't have the arm to back it up. So he's got a world-class level hand and wrist, but his arm isn't quite there yet. Yeah. Not only the arm, but he also, his wrist didn't handle Davit' grenade. They lost wrist, but also wrist.
Michael Todd: Alex Lawson, they were like this together. And then they had more horsepower and then beating with it. That's what I try to do to people. I try to make people's risk go back, even if mine's back. That way, I know that they train to be strong here. They don't no one trains to be strong here. Only me. Yeah, I'm comfortable to go there as long as you're there too. But if I'm here, and you're here, this is a bad day for me. You know what I mean? I have a question for you. You know, the times that
Engin Terzi: like in the past day was arm messing, like more like wrists, like curling and pinning side pressure with this way. And now after he get top rolled, you know, he started to adapt in a style. Evgeny he loses his wrist a little bit, he protects his own pronator and he applies side pressure with his pronator here. So do you think that because of doing
Engin Terzi: this kind of training and this kind of pulling, this kind of preparation, he got better? And then do you think that he may have a chance against you next time you meet him? Or do you think that you have his number and he will not change? Okay, so here's the deal. If I'm anything less than my best, Dave Chaffee's going to beat me. But if I come in at my best, all I got to do is stop that match.
Michael Todd: that's it if i stop it like that and we're both spun out i'm i'm it's just there's something about it when i'm across the table from dave once i have that spot i'm there like i know it you know what i mean that he may be different this time because of the training that way and i and i think that's awesome and it would work against anyone else but when i tell you very mental for me
Michael Todd: Yeah. If the believe I'm going to win in the middle of the match, I'm going to win. Yeah. So it just, to me, Dave's chance is to turn me pump. Dave has to turn me palm up and he has to get me out of there early. If some comes a grinder and we're in an equal position, you are saying that if the match, the first round of Kurdesha and Dave, they stopped for a moment like this, and then they was
Engin Terzi: able to go if you stop dave in that same position that alex and he ended up right after the goal then that's enough for you to win this is what you are saying right if i'm at my best if i'm if i'm my normal self then absolutely absolutely and my 100 i believe that in my heart michael to be honest you know if he beats you and then now when you say that if i am anywhere near my best
Engin Terzi: then then then if he wins against you then will it mean that you were not at your best that this guy like like
Michael Todd: then then maybe we will not be giving him enough credit when you say that like he beats you it is because only because you are not at your best and that's not that's not what i'm trying to say in my opinion if i'm as strong as i have been previously yeah everything i've done leading up to the match proves that yeah i think there's been i don't think there's been a version today that beats me
Michael Todd: Now, is it possible that there's a version that Dave could become that beats me in that match? Anything is possible. So if he was to beat me, and I'm at my best, and he beat me, I'm like, well, I was wrong. Dave was better than me. He beat me. But my mind tells me that there is no version of Dave that's ever existed, that if the match stops right there and I'm performing on all cylinders, that he beats me. Another question. You saw the other matches on the card, and
Engin Terzi: Do you have any opinion of any of the other matches? Because many of the North Americans are not so familiar with the Eastern Pullers, as long as they are not super heavyweight. Did you have any chance to look at the card and then say that, I think this way you can have an opinion about the both guys?
Engin Terzi: This is what I got so far. And I don't know the entire list, but I'm going to try to go through it. I think John is too much for Zurab. I just think he's too much. So I think John... Is it possible that... Like, just this question. How much better Zurab should be to put John in the position that he put Ron? From the last time you saw Zurab.
Michael Todd: if he's like 20 more than 10 more than 10 yeah in my i mean that's just gauging on who ron is compared to who john brzenk is i love ron bath ron bass amazing but john brzenk's a different person you know what i'm saying what okay so and here's the other thing we're going we're a lot of us are gauging john on what he did to zolia
Michael Todd: But we're thinking of the Zoliev that beat Todd Hutchings June 12th of last year, not the Zoliev that took second at the WAS, right? Which was the most recent Zoliev. So that's the data we need to use. Yeah. So maybe John's performance against Zoliev wasn't as impressive as our mind made it believe because we're thinking of what Zoliev did to Todd. No, for sure it wasn't the same Zoliev, for sure. Yeah.
Michael Todd: so maybe the match was durev could be closer but i just think john is too versatile will john test him out in a hook of course he will because it's john brzee you know me but i think john's gonna take his hand from him if that's my opinion do you think that if it is two zero john would still go inside if he's losing two to zero no no winning two zero yes
Michael Todd: But does it depend on how comfortable he won the first two rounds? Yes. Yeah. So that's a follow-up question. And then the second match that I don't know if Todd Hutchings beats a Rackley. I want to say he will. I want to say he will.
Michael Todd: But İrakli's pronation might be just enough to open up Todd's bottom two fingers. In the strap? Well, in the strap, Todd has a lot more connection. But I'm going to be honest. İrakli is pretty impressive in the strap as well. His ability to continue. Imagine in the strap. Yeah. Well, it didn't against Zoliev. And it should have. Zoliev's hand control without the strap.
Engin Terzi: is so great zola when sasha wanted to go step with zola zola pin him like this and when special wanted to go iraq strap with the iraq they equally sleep iraq without the step is not that dominant iraq is top role is uh mostly dependent on back pressure and pronated but the only thing is is it enough to beat todd hutchings by taking his wrist
Michael Todd: No, you have to be able to put him in a bond. I mean, if you just take his wrist and you let him still be connected here. Yeah. He's eating you. He'll wear you out. He'll sit there longer than you will. Um, but I plan on beating Todd Hutchings with back pressure and pronation. That's how I plan on beating. So I'm definitely awesome. You are kind of different because like your endurance in your own game,
Engin Terzi: it actually also has incredible good endurance. But I mean, if we if we talked about it, actually, is she like, endurance guy? No, he's he's about you when you put the match into your game. Are you endurance guy? I mean, you can of course, lead anyone you know, to the day shaky versus Genadi. If Genadi's wrists held up, yeah,
Michael Todd: I think it's 55-45 Dave. If his wrist gets cracked the first time, it's 90-10 Dave. How about if it goes to the same point that Alex and Dave went and both lost the wrist in this position? If the match stops in the center like that, I hate saying this, I think Genadi wins with the press. Yeah.
Michael Todd: Because I don't think Dave has that same transitioning. He does have a transitional press. It's just not as smooth as Genadi's. What I do believe, though, is Dave will be strong enough where the match doesn't stop like that. In my opinion. I understand. So you are saying that a big possibility that Dave is going to just dominate. Genadi will not be able to match his
Michael Todd: that explosiveness to stop the match. If Genadi's wrist does not hold up, then I don't see any path for him to win. If his wrist is solid, then it's a very, very close match in my opinion. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But as I said, you know, if both wrists loses. Yeah. If both wrists loses in the matches. So if the match, both wrists loses in a match is stalemated. I think it comes down to Genadi presses.
Michael Todd: So in the center, in the center, Genadi has chance, but if it is so much losing position for Genadi, he may not be able to. Yeah. Okay. So he shouldn't be caught on his muscles bicep, but Dave's side pressure and lats will be too much for body's bicep. I understand. Yeah. I understand. So the next match, uh, Derek Smith, Derek Smith person, right-handed Derek Smith and Morozov. Yeah.
Michael Todd: um we i don't have enough data on morzal other than the fact that prudnik destroyed him right but i think derek has came into his own and i think he's more versatile i think morzal is more explosive so i think if morzal wins he flashes him if the match goes into a hand battle i think derek wins
Michael Todd: So I'm saying 60-40. How hard if he goes here? Derek is liking that hook a lot recently. Yes, yeah. So, I mean, he reminds me of Devin, the way he will sink his hook. I'm not saying it's as strong as Devin's hook, but he looks very similar the way he sinks it. I think Morozov's path to victory is he has to completely control him and get him out of there early. If he doesn't, I think Derek wins. I understand.
Michael Todd: Marcio, go ahead. Marcio, you know the guy, Sporrong. Do you remember him? Tobias? Obvious, yeah, yeah, obvious. Yeah, he looked really good against Morozov left-handed that one match where he exposed him. Yeah. Is that a left-handed match or right-handed match? Right-handed? It's right-handed, yeah. Okay, I hate saying this too. Marcio's elbow fouls are horrible.
Michael Todd: He has a very hard time keeping his elbow on the pad under strict rules. So I don't know if he can beat him without fouling. I understand. Do you think that he can hook him without elbow fouling? Man, I don't know what he can do without elbow fouling. He floats his elbow bad. But I think Marcio is in a very rare form right now. I think he's very good right now.
Michael Todd: Yes, yes, yes. He is very good, yeah. So I think he can beat him. It's just the problem for me that makes it hard for me to pick him is does he foul out? So he needs to position himself without fouling. Once he can position without elbow fouling, he's stronger. That's what you are saying. That's what I believe to be the case. I don't have enough information to make that as a statement that I believe wholeheartedly in, but that's what my opinion is.
Michael Todd: marcio's got experience and marcio's competed against the best and beaten the best marcio's a bad dude it's just uh every time i've seen him outside the wal unless it's a local tournament where he's way better than everybody he's plagued with elbow fouls so i don't know and what do you think about matt mask and prudish
Engin Terzi: I think Prudence is going to kill him. But I like Matt a lot. I think Matt's awesome. I love his character. I love his personality. I think that's the biggest mismatch of the card. Yeah. But I have no idea. I have nothing, no statements. Can I ask you something? Yeah. He has top-rolled Barboza and beat him. He has wins against John Brzee top-rolling and winning. I mean, he will be for sure stronger than the time that he met
Engin Terzi: team is going to get bigger. And I think that the round one when he was trying to beat team like Derek did, like by controlling his pronator was a mistake. But whenever he went for the pure his own way of top rolling, he was also taking teams risk. So I mean, like he has beaten Gasparini by top rolling, he has top rolled touchings, but didn't have enough horsepower to beat him like this. And
Engin Terzi: what makes us think that you know matt can't do anything you know just like people um i understand prudnik is like looking favorite i understand but like don't you think that we are like underestimating matt you know a little bit maybe i think matt gotten so used to wal devon rules that when you put him under strict rules he doesn't arm wrestle as well
Engin Terzi: what i think i might be wrong but i think he's gotten so used to close your thumb close your hand climbing all this you can't do under regular rules that the advantage that he's getting he won't be able to get yeah but did he not pin john a few times in the there was like was the ual what was it yeah okay you're talking about two you're talking about nine years ago yeah when john was younger
Michael Todd: and then when when matt was probably not as strong as now i think no yeah i don't know and i just okay i like like i said it's hard for me to say things like i like matt a lot i think matt is awesome yeah i think that's a good matchup yeah in my i might be completely wrong he might beat him and shock the world yeah but he's 108 kilo he is like about 237 he is
Michael Todd: And Matt is going to come, my guess, minimum 255. So I was just thinking that because of the weight difference and everything, you know, like he could be good. You're an expert in arm wrestling. No, no, no, no. We all can make mistakes. 100% right. I just, it's so hard for me to, like, I heard Ryan Bowen say Matt Mask is top 10 in the world. And I'm like, Ryan, I don't, I like Matt too, but
Michael Todd: Okay, people think I should retire because I've lost the last two super matches. Now I'm just saying these are internet trolls and I'm horrible and I suck and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Matt Mask has lost his last three super matches and people think he should be top 10 in the world. He lost to Wayne. Right now, no way. Right now, no way. Yeah, he lost to Wayne. He lost to Hermes. He lost to Tim Bresnan.
Michael Todd: I mean, you're on a three loss losing streak. Yeah, yeah. But no, no, no. I understand right now. Maybe not. But I see that this guy with a good training, he has the potential to be around 10 somewhere. You know, I think he's going to elaborate on that. I think you're 100 percent right. His potential is insane. But so is Rock Junior. But we're never going to see it because he's not going to do the work. You know what I mean? Michael, I will ask you something.
Engin Terzi: I asked Prudnik, Prudnik said that because of the war in Ukraine, he said he doesn't want to compete. He didn't want to compete. And then sometime after he said he wants to compete, arm wrestle, and then represent Ukraine, and then donate some of the money that he made to the Ukrainian people. He asked me as a friend, you know, can you send me a match as well?
Michael Todd: You had a match already. I was supposed to be pulling Prudnik though. That was supposed to be my max. Remember? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. Yeah. So I had a match. Todd had a match. John had a match. Matt is a good, I mean, I'm not saying that it wasn't a good match. Yeah. I don't know who, who was maybe, but he said that he said that, yeah, I asked him about you. He said for you, he needs to train.
Engin Terzi: more yeah he said that he said that he hasn't trained after he hasn't trained after east versus west two for about one month he said that for michael i i need to get into you know uh better shape this is what he said he said no no no it's too early for me he said as far as i remember i need i need to check our uh chat history oh that's what you told me but i mean that then i remember correct yeah yeah
Michael Todd: And I'm just going to tell you, I have so much respect for these guys and for them to put me at a high enough level to where they're like, hey, I need to train a little bit more. That's, I mean, I don't care what the internet says. It's my fellow peer arm wrestlers that I get the respect from that. I mean, that means a lot. So that really does touch me and makes me feel good. Michael, just you have every right to have this, what you're saying, you know, don't worry about it.
Engin Terzi: you lost dennis but it was for two and you pull against the best versions of devon you know okay dennis you have win against devon you have beaten pushkar if pushkar didn't figure out how to do that the the shoulder press in last moment you were beating pushkar as well in in i was right there so just forget about it like yeah people yeah yeah just just have like confidence you know just
Engin Terzi: Just no, don't, don't. Like, I understand people, some people may not like you. People doesn't like me. Some people doesn't like me. Some people may hate you. Some people may hate me. Some people may hate Devon. It's okay. But everyone knows if somebody is pulling Michael, everyone's opinion, you are not going to beat Michael only with pure strength.
Engin Terzi: you need to have tools to deal what he is doing and everything so just forget it you know just like i respect you and then you deserve it hundred percent of course that everything needs to needs more time to pull with you you know of course you know so it will be it will be great i think that other matches i don't know if you have much opinion marcio's left arm and uh
Engin Terzi: Matt Mask will pull more left arm, but yeah. What about Paul Linn? Paul Linn's opening, I didn't ask about that because I am sure that you don't know his opponent. He's 176 world champion. Paul Linn beating Ron Bath was impressive, wasn't it? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Whenever I ask, okay, this guy, Samushia, he was 171.
Engin Terzi: He took third place in the overalls at Zloty. Do you remember the guys, Sandris, that beat Chen Xiao? Yeah. Last time you came. This guy, Sandris, a police opponent in the Sandris, had like long hook match, long, you know. And so this guy, then he was 171. Now he's 200 pounds. So he's 30 pounds heavier. And yeah, he looks in good shape, my opinion.
Engin Terzi: i will say my opinion because i'm not going to pick anyone to win because this is one of the matches the potential match that is going to be the next drop versus run i think that they will go inside and i think the match will take long and they decided we were in the youtube live they said that let's start in hook first round oh you're kidding me yeah so i will ask nephews to start straight but
Engin Terzi: whenever they are going, I will just say, let's go and then let them start there. As they said, yeah. Pauline is underestimated. I saw Paul versus John, how John's arm was like stretched like this. He got even injured that, that Paul is a, is a strong guy, stronger than what people are thinking. And whenever I saw him against Ron, of course, maybe it was only what five weeks later or something Ron maybe wasn't super recovered because that match was long.
Engin Terzi: And maybe one wasn't as prepared as, you know, East versus West. Still, he didn't have much resistance. He hook him and he beat him, you know. Yeah. So Paul is very strong guy. I like, I like Paul. Paul's a good guy too. So I like arm wrestle. I'm a fan. But yeah, I don't know the rest of the matches. I think that might be most of them. But yeah, I think, honestly, I think the West has a very good chance of coming out on top this time. Yeah. All the, all the Paul, except Brutnick,
Engin Terzi: versus Matt, the, the Western guys, like, like 70% to 30% John on the pole is like 90%. And again, so, I mean, as I said, you know, this is as best as it can get at this moment, because Devon has a super match. He cannot come. Jerry is not playing well. He said that he is not ready. I invited him every time people says, why don't you invite Devon? There is no single time that I didn't invite Devon. Right.
Engin Terzi: only this time i didn't invite him the reason is i know that he has a match to focus i don't think he's going to come here and pull someone five weeks before he's gonna pull levan so or it would be like so stupid you know you know even to ask him you know only i asked him would you come as a guest and he said no i need i need to focus levan i also asked the one he said he's gonna travel some other country on those days so
Engin Terzi: So Jerry, I asked Jerry said that, and you know, I'm not ready. I'm just coming back. So I also offer Jerry for the August. So every, every top arm master, but I will tell, I want to tell while you are here, I know we're going to finish. I don't want to take you so long, but, um, guys, um, this event is costing about 20% more than the last event. And mostly because of the travel expenses, everything is getting more expensive. Um, so.
Engin Terzi: I will see I will see how much you guys support this time and then August event I already set matches, I will organize it, but the number of matches that I will set for the August event will totally be depending on like how much I will be able to cover this event so so my guess will be like nine 10 matches for do August otherwise you know I won't be able to. organize.
Engin Terzi: uh these matches and you know michael when when when people write me and you please set my match i'm ready i'm so strong i just trust me you know do you know how i feel i feel like i don't i'm not a businessman i feel like oh this guy needs a match you know and you need to do something else then so i feel like guilty if i can't but eventually i don't have power unlimited power if i could do all of them i would have to set like 40 matches and the people will
Engin Terzi: or to watch and i i will be losing like huge huge money and then i will never be able to organize an event so while you are here and then 627 people are watching i just wanted to say this to the people michael if you have we i will see you only one week later right you come in thursday thursday afternoon yeah yes sir it will be great to see you it will be great to see you
Michael Todd: I'm excited to get back over there, but I feel so much better. The last 10 weeks of healthy eating and training, I got a smile on my face. I'm happy. Rebecca's in great shape. I see that. I see that.
Michael Todd: much stress on you so much stress it was so bad and i don't have that stress i mean i just i let it go you know i don't have that stress anymore so do i have that fighting spirit i still want to win absolutely as much as ever but at the same time i'm enjoying life and i look forward to seeing you i look for i'm this time last time i stayed in my room until a few matches before mine i told her back in the day i'm gonna go down and watch all the matches i'm just gonna be down there taking in the environment taking in the you know the atmosphere and created arm wrestle you know
Engin Terzi: Do you remember how stressful you were at the press conference? Yeah. You looked so angry. I was even afraid to ask you a question. You were like breathing fire, you know. But I was thinking that, you know, it should be taking so much energy from you to put so much, that much stress on yourself, you know.
Engin Terzi: I mean, you're going to do your best. I don't think that by putting so much stress, it is going to, I think that you need to save a little bit of it for the event. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Like I said, I mean, this is a big family anyway. I mean, arm wrestling has always been a big family. It's just...
Michael Todd: get out on the table. We get to find out who the man is on that day. And I'm excited. So all you guys that are watching, go subscribe. I mean, go buy your pay-per-view. Share this with as many people as possible. What Ingan's doing is amazing. And hopefully I win my match so that I get to pull Alex in August. I mean, I can't say that
Engin Terzi: because I will be look like I will be hoping for us to lose, you know, so let the better one win and then we will talk about it, you know. Okay. Thank you, Michael. Thank you very much for your time and hope to see you next week, my friend. I wish you the best. Just take care of yourself. Good. Yes, sir. Be good. Take care. Bye bye. Bye bye. Anyways, guys. So we we had a nice chat with
Engin Terzi: um um michael taught and sorry that i couldn't follow the chat so much at same time just because people say that i look at so much to the chat and then i should pay more attention to the guests so guys seriously i really like if if i had millions you know the the only thing that i would do i would do um um
Engin Terzi: help to put people in organized arm wrestling matches. You know, I really don't care about money. Yeah. Anyways, guys, if you guys don't have any question, a chance will not be there. You know, chance will not be there. I don't think you can sign, you know. Thank you, guys. Thank you again.
Engin Terzi: Guys last two days for the for the. sign. t shirts and all the all the Atlas will sign them and last two days, because we need to know the exact number we're going to order how many needs to be printed so guys remember after Saturday, there will not be. i'm not i'm feeling better I cannot say that I feel so so.
Engin Terzi: famous guest in your event as guest. Yeah, Larry Wills is coming as a guest, and Hermes Gasparini is coming. I invited Levan and Devon, but they are focused on their matches. And then, yeah, John fell strong. So, guys, as I said, just please support the event, and then
Engin Terzi: um self-made strap in your room and i don't think that we we are offering such thing right now wow lebanon was in the chat that's that's great wow that one is a nice guy i love the guy you know i i till now i felt nothing but friendship positive you know this guy is just i have so much respect for him um yeah yeah yeah yeah that's how
Engin Terzi: is versus was your Amazon lady will be in the press conference as well. Yeah, yeah. 19 matches. We already said some matches. We said, Ryan Bowen versus myself. And we have Lachlan versus sundries. And we said, prudnik versus Tata shins, Iraqi versus john. This is an Alexa versus daddy can with left arm with the weight limit. Yeah, if
Engin Terzi: Derek Smith will do the first match of the day and then he will help us with the commentating. I asked him if it's possible. He said yes. And also Coach Ray will be there. So what was that, you guys? Yeah, I will also like discuss about. You can put the paper with $15. I don't think people won't pay.
Engin Terzi: i didn't understand what do you think about happens promise to never lose a round i don't know that's a question for uh leon yeah oleg versus daddy can we agreed on the 102 kilo weight limit because um but it can is heavier than that and oleg is much lighter than that so i think it would be fair you know i think oleg will be maximum 90 kilo while um
Engin Terzi: that it can make hundred truth. That is how we agreed. Yeah, we owe each other. Guys, you guys are making this evidence, you know, that is you guys are like in a financial way, you guys are paying for what you want to see. I am just being a bridge. I am just being a bridge between
Engin Terzi: You guys and your dream matches. That is what we are doing. Anyways, guys, I think only one week left, athletes to arrive. And women pulling, most of the female pullers from the East, they are at the European Championships. Only a week right now they are in Romania for the European Championships.
Engin Terzi: and and then the others are the russians russians are not allowed to compete uh because of the international ban um it's not my choice and thinking in the event is better than anything in history thank you thank you very much guys thank you for the support and i hope enough people support so we can have more events yes yes this is this is my my i mean you know
Engin Terzi: only thing that would hurt me is that I can't continue making these dreams come true. That is not only your dream, it's my dream too. I enjoy as much as you enjoy. So I see that people have been chatting about these matches, who would win, this guy, but these are all on the social media. They are talking. So we set them and then we see, you know, I mean, imagine that, you know, we have so many great athletes and the
Engin Terzi: their career is finishing without these guys meeting each other. So then it's unfair to these athletes. It is unfair to the fans. So, so you guys, and I, you guys trust me and I do my best to not disappoint you. And then, so we, we are making our dreams, uh, coming true. Yeah. I think this, this is as great as, uh, possible.
Engin Terzi: Thank you for your support. If you want to support, please, uh, from core sports by, uh, pay-per-view it is, um, $13.99. I saw the other day, uh, Travis was, uh, Travis is planning to set, uh, Tatachins versus John and they, they were asking like $10.99. Yes. It deserves it. John Brzing versus Tatachins. Yes. $10.99.
Engin Terzi: So if that deserves that match, all this match that I am putting $13.99, it deserves. And guys, trust me, most likely I will be losing some money because I am a little bit stupid that I set the matches, everything. And then I started calculating things. So it is about 20% more than the last time. But I am thinking that because I believe I gain your trust, you
Engin Terzi: guys will support more this time and then hopefully we will cover and then we will make a good plan for the august yeah thank you thank you josh thank you thank you yeah yeah yeah i will oh my short cobra if i don't forget yes because i will be extremely busy extremely busy you know those days most of times i am awake with if you are asleep my friends if you are asleep that you know because
Engin Terzi: Because I am the only content I don't have an organization and I have friends to help me, but I am the one that is as contact with the Atlas, so I need to be in touch with everyone so. So they only know me, you know. Thank you guys, thank you, I mean your support your winner, I read this that how you guys spotted.
Engin Terzi: it just increases my motivation seriously week before that i feel like you know yes yes we're gonna do it yeah uh hello to friends thank you thank you my friends yeah yeah everything will be good everything yeah we have a very professional people about the the filming and broadcasting everything that that's my main thing you know

Engin Terzi: Oh, super chat. Yes, yes, yes. The, the, the, the YouTube, YouTube, YouTube, just, I don't know what was, what's going on. You know, YouTube told me that I, I do, I use the reused content, you know, reuse content. What? Like I do interview with athletes. I share prediction videos and I share the super matches videos from the event that I organized. And then maybe a few videos I had that, you know,
Engin Terzi: like when I had, I was part of the conversation with some other channel with a shortly or something. I had delete all of them. Now they said that, you know, majority of my channel is reuse content, but how is it possible? And I appeal. And then they, they check it personally and they said, yeah, it's reuse. I was like, how they don't answer, but on 15th, after 15th of this month, I will again apply for the monetizing thing, you know,
Engin Terzi: anyways we want super chat baggy i don't know if youtube allows me if youtube allows me yeah i will do it i will do it i don't know why everything is going like this i don't understand i don't i try not to do anything wrong but whatever whatever anyways guys do you have any questions i have tomorrow i will be guest of travis pageant live travis pageant um that was is that
Engin Terzi: Tell me I am the greatest or something, the show name. He and Ertem Taranenko. Taranenko, right? I don't know how I'm spelling correct or not. Yeah, it will be fun. You guys don't know, maybe I told you guys, but I did an interview with Travis, two hours, seven minutes. It was recorded. It's supposed to be recorded by Skype.
Engin Terzi: and then the conversation was incredibly good i mean the best ever and then everything finished and then i realized that i forgot to uh start recording you know so it's uh wasted jerry cadaret maybe maybe almas gasparini
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah but they say that is the it has to be majority of the videos i had like 120 videos and then we had like three four of them three four of them yeah uh would i invite the guys who lose it east versus west three for the next possible but i would it would be don't you think they're more fair
Engin Terzi: to continue with the guys who are winning because I will have a limited card. And if I give losers and then if I also invite the winners, either I need to change the pairs and then bring the same guys and pull. So maybe the guys who loses this time maybe needs to a little bit rest, maybe for the not the next event, but the event after.
Engin Terzi: know i will just do my best you know i will just it is not possible to give everyone chance at once my friends okay they used videos from my channel and copyright i mean uh they shouldn't use any super matches from uh east versus west guys you know um
Engin Terzi: About 110 or something videos were taken down by the copyrights and then unfortunately some channels were closed because of the copy site, but they need to understand it. People are paying money for this, and I am also we are also paying money for the athletes for the travel for the hotel for the video. Production for the stage and everything you know when you and everything so.
Engin Terzi: I mean, if they do this, sorry, but they are not helping arm wrestling. So this time will be even more strict, even on Instagram and Facebook, everywhere. Sorry, anyone who is doing this, that person is harming arm wrestling. I understand that not everyone can afford to watch these matches, but they can wait two days, you know, and then I will be posting on my channel. You know, they can wait. If they can afford, then, I mean, they need to wait. You know, that's how it is, my friend.
Engin Terzi: You know, because these events have expenses. So how am I going to cover? The thing is that if everyone is doing that, then I cannot cover the event. I cannot organize it. So then you can ask those guys to organize an event and then serve the arm wrestling community. If they are not going to do that, they better respect what we are doing.
Engin Terzi: I think that there is an email address that you put on the GoFundMe thing. Very soon, you will be contacted within the GoFundMe through, I think, email. And you will be asked for your address to send the t-shirt. And you will be given a paper record for the event. Because of your donation, you will receive a paper record to watch.
Engin Terzi: Thank you guys. No, the worst part, they try to do even live broadcasting, live broadcasting they are trying to do. It's terrible, but trust me, you know, like I really will not consider those people as true arm-lacing fans. People who try to do that, sorry, they will be taking action against them. Their channels, you know, the videos will be,
Engin Terzi: down and then three strikes the channels will be closed some people privately because their channels are closing they asked me you know hanging please and then some of them i said okay and then i talked with four sports so they they took it back strike back they have the channel now but if they do it again next time there will be no excuse you know
Unknown: We can ask, we can ask Samushia if you understood correct or not. But Samushia is a hook puller. If he wants to start inside, we can talk, you know. Engin, 30. Probably that's a disrespect, huh, Arif? It's Engin Terzi, my friend, Engin Terzi. Yep. Engin Terzi who served arm wrestling for 30 years. Arm wrestling and people like you.
Engin Terzi: Okay, if he didn't understand, someone didn't understand, then we can ask him, you know, anything is possible to change it. For the signed t-shirt, $100, but, you know, we do the shipment. As you know, t-shirt costs some money, and printing costs some money, also pay-per-view, also shipment wherever you are in the world. So it's $100, and then the athletes will be
Engin Terzi: signing all of them you'll be signing those um yeah anyways last last two days for the t-shirt not even two days you know just yeah saturday is the last day yes basically last two days and then then um because i i remind this because after the after the gofundme finishes people keep asking me how to donate what to do how to donate
Unknown: i'm just reminded last two days and i don't get in a state i do this like normal private organization i not i don't buy beef jerky and i'm not eating um will be commentating um commentator will be derek smith and
Engin Terzi: um coach ray yep your t-shirt will be sent yes my friend yes and yeah it will be great event i i can imagine that you know these these are you know every sport has fans you know people are getting like so happy about ronaldo messi yeah and i like football too i used to like more but now i mean i don't so much enjoy but i these are the
Engin Terzi: messi's and ronaldo's are missing they are coming this is great you know waiting for them at the airport they are coming taking them to the hotel and all together you're going to eat and then and those names are called imagine that you know just just now imagine that you know those names are coming to the table yeah it will be it will be incredible it will be incredible yes
Engin Terzi: anyways guys if you don't have any questions then i thinking how come you weren't really active in the arm wrestling community social until kovitz yeah i was very active guys you guys didn't know um until like maybe 2013 or something from early 2000s i was very active that is how that the the older arm wrestling fans they they know me
Engin Terzi: There was an east-northeast message board, and that north-east message board was like very, how to say, like really, real armwrestling community was there, you know. When I say real, I don't mean that others are not real, but these people, our community was like mostly made by armwrestlers, not really fans. We didn't really have so much fans. If somebody is involved, it was armwrestlers.
Engin Terzi: So we had, we had a message board. Imagine that the same message board almost every day subjects there. And then John is right in there. They will not, but is right in there. Michael is right in Cleveland. Rest in peace was right in there. Rhombus is right in there. Sharon Ramos, Cobra roads, you know, all those, you know, Neil pick up there, you know, this, all those legendary figures, you know, we were chatting, we were chatting together, you know?
Engin Terzi: It was still the same. The Facebook group that I have, in fact, it was started as Arm Wrestling John and Engin, not the Arm Wrestling Engin. It was Arm Wrestling John and Engin, but later John wanted to leave, so he left. But even the beginning of that, we were the same, even on the Facebook page that now Arm Wrestling, like I was gone for like seven years or six years, whatever. I was still riding, but I wasn't paying attention, you know.
Engin Terzi: And then during the COVID, I had to stay at home. So whenever I opened my eyes, I was like, wow, I'm missing that so big, you know, like thousands of fans. And, you know, like, I was like, wow, I really didn't know much about that. And then I started like, I was like, okay, people are down. Neil Pickup contacted me.
Engin Terzi: He said, and in the communities like down, you know, nobody can get out of home. We need to keep the fire on. Like, I'm going to do presence of greatness. You, John Devon, would you join? Yeah, I was like, okay. But I was like, I felt like how John felt after six years. I still continue arm wrestle, but I was away from the community. So I was like, okay, like everything was so new to me. And then I get used to with time. I get used to that.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, thank you. Thank you, my friend. I respect everyone too. The only thing is that not really. Guys, I'm okay as long as I don't lose money. Guys, I am not an organizer. I'm repeating again. I have been organizing tournaments a long time, like John Brzing versus Arsene, Krasimir versus John Brzing.
Engin Terzi: Arsene Lille versus Travis Bergen. I organized many events in the past. It was just because I wanted to do something with community. I love it. Still, this is not my profession. It's not my profession. So the thing is, I understand how arm masters feel very well. I know how they feel. I know how fans feel, but I know more how arm masters feel. Like, for example, Ongarbeyev.
Engin Terzi: just got injured, like I could say to Marcio, Marcio, sorry, your opponent is now out or something, you know, or before last time, like Cody Merritt got injured, Barboza got COVID last time, I'm talking about East versus West too. And even a few days before the event, Beerman, he got COVID, he couldn't come, but I did replace because I know their opponents
Engin Terzi: are ready, they train, they come. I know how they would feel when I say, sorry, you know, it's not my fault, they get COVID, so what can I do? You know, but I do replacement, mostly because of the athletes, but also because of the fans too, because fans, they are paying money. So they, it's their right to expect something back. You know, I understand that. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: George Desano and Talgat Akteyar. I also organized an event early last year in April. Talgat Akteyar was invited. He participated the best eight guys in 78. He took second place after Bojidar. Yeah, Talgat is a great bowler. Yeah. Yeah, I would, of course, you know, right?
Engin Terzi: You are welcome, guys. Thank you. Thank you very much. Same for your family as well. Virtual, virtual crush. How hot is it in Turkey? It's fine, like probably 20 degrees daytime, I think. Oh, GoFundMe? Yeah, it's nice. It's nice. It is, yeah, 15,500, but the GoFundMe takes some, cuts some percentage from that.
Engin Terzi: match organized. What if you did like where the best matches given some kind of bonus? Yeah, we can we can. I love these ideas. You know, I love these ideas. Once my group are there in your event, we can meet and we will pay entries. Yeah, yeah, it will be open to do. You know, there is a limited place.
Engin Terzi: For the Turkish people, it will be invitational. There will be some national team athletes, national team trainers, some federation members, some officials. We will invite them. It will not be open to public because those invited people will have their part in the venue. But for the foreign people, they can enter with entry, enter via
Engin Terzi: Thanks for organizing. This time might be the dream team. I donated yesterday. Who can I report a paper? No, you will be contacted. They will give you the paper report, and they will ask your address, and then you will give, and then we will ship your t-shirt to your address. Are you from where, Greece?
Engin Terzi: Excuse my ignorance. Your last name sounded that way. Are you a neighbor? God bless you too, Michael. Perfect. Thanks a lot. You're welcome. So,
Engin Terzi: Anyways, I don't know how many people will be coming, but I'm just thinking like if I should do some event posters as well, you know, to the yes. Hello. Hello to Greece. Hello. If you are there right now, you may be a Greek, but living somewhere else, but hello to neighbor country. Um, why not start another channel? You can monetize. I will try to monetize the same channel.
Engin Terzi: They said that I can apply one month later. So may 15 i'm able to apply but let's see if they are going to accept or not all the videos that I used. You know the small parts that john talking about me or they weren't talking about me or something I deleted Hello Hello my friend any news on Italy, Italy, I don't know any any news on.
Engin Terzi: We tell you, we tell you said that, you know, if he would be happy to be part of the East versus West and I need to, uh, get okay from the international, uh, Federation. I would recommend you to arm muscle as much as possible. You can still continue, uh, lifting, doing pull-ups that's good hand grip or whatever, but just arm muscle as much as possible, because you need to record that, that, that,
Engin Terzi: muscle memory to your arm. And don't quit just because you have pain, especially the side of your arms. Be careful when you are totally supinated and putting pressure like this because your joints probably very strong right now, but it's not supported with the muscle groups that you need. So that most likely the first pain you will have or injury you will have from the inside of your elbow. And so be careful about that.
Engin Terzi: Um, don't waste your time fighting a losing battle with YouTube. I, I don't know. I don't know if, if that is the case, then they will close the, uh, they monetize the next, next channel as well. You know, I just, he's Ryan is gonna lose. I don't know. I will just go there, do my best. He will do his best and then table will show.
Engin Terzi: You are better than Mazurenko in organizing. It is so incredible what you are. Thank you very much. Igor Mazurenko served arm wrestling a lot. He did a lot. I can't, I can't, as I say, you know, I am thankful to everyone who served arm wrestling. We like him. We don't like him. It doesn't matter. You know, he served arm wrestling a lot and he was a great organizer. I think that he is
Engin Terzi: Organizer, while I am someone different, I am more like arm wrestlers or arm wrestling fan or whatever, you know, you call me. I'm not really, if I was the organizer, I would pick five, six matches maximum and then would focus on making money, you know, instead of just worrying that, you know, if I'm going to cover the event or not. So, um, uh, hello to Pakistan, Daniel, Daniel Han.
Engin Terzi: What do you think about Igor? I don't want to get involved. Me and seven of my friends are buying paper. We separate this for this event. Loving the content. Thank you. Thank you, my friend. Williams, I don't know how to pronounce your first name, so I don't want to look funny. If it was Turkish, I would say Jalep, but I don't know if it is in English. But Williams, it's your last name. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Engin Terzi: I hope that I hope that I will cover the events, then nothing can stop me continue organizing August, November as long as I am, I'm alive. The next channel will be a separate entity, you should show the East Coast best match on that. And within the week, you'll have subs. Yeah, I understand. But it will take some time to bring it to the point to be monetized, I think.
Engin Terzi: like Neil does with arm wars. I understand. Yeah, I was just thinking I'm very bad about those things. Anyways, guys, I thank you very, very much for following. And once again, he's not here. But thank you, Michael Todd, for being part of it and taking so much attention. And we will do our best. Just like, keep following us. I don't train
Engin Terzi: side pressure in the gym. I mostly did at the table. Yeah. Your side pressure really needs to be supported by the key muscle groups coordination to be effective. Your name is Tata Shinks. I understand. Thank you, Davit, for the advices. Okay, guys, you all take care. Paul, I don't know if you are
Unknown: there thank you very very much and you all take care my friend thank you guys thank you thank you thank you love you all and thank you for your support thank you phil thank you see you see you next week my friend you will be
