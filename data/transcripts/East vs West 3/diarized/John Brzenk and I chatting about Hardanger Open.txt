SPEAKER_02: Hello, John. Can you turn the phone sideways? Yeah, OK. Yeah, I got it. How are you?
Engin Terzi: at work good how are you doing this morning yeah i'm at work yeah people were wondering you know how you can have time while working well the the airplanes come and go like the next bank is until uh like eight o'clock so i've got like a little hour gap so we were gonna do this chat on your channel but you said you couldn't figure out something you know i think and then that's why we are doing here yeah well
John Brzenk: yeah i'm at are you are you doing this through zoom yeah i'm assuming you're doing it through zoom so you're doing zoom live yeah okay yeah the only thing i the only the only thing i didn't figure out or just didn't really know anything about was doing the uh chat you know people asking questions and stuff it automatically turns on don't you think uh well it didn't turn on when i did the test with you the other day oh but maybe nobody asked questions oh maybe not yeah
John Brzenk: yeah you know but i but i but i saw questions on my phone uh-huh yeah yeah anyway so how do you feel i'm feeling good yeah i'm healthy um i'm uh i've been training i ended up pulling uh yesterday and i'm heading to utah i'm gonna go to utah today hopefully in this snow vale so um
John Brzenk: i'm gonna get a good shoulder workout good hand workout from 12 on uh probably tomorrow and sunday so we should be good yep yep that's good that's good and how do you feel no pain everything is ready um yeah just the usual stuff you know i've been um you know doing a little bit more with the cables and the overhead stuff so uh you know shoulders but
Engin Terzi: flaring up a little bit here and there. I've been having trouble sleeping, so I get up and grab some ibuprofen. It gets me through the night. Yeah, I was curious about, John, when you started to add more of gym training, and how did it affect your arm wrestling performance? Well, the verdict still, you know,
John Brzenk: yet to be seen i mean still out i mean not i i definitely am feeling some areas that i that i haven't uh you know felt just from strictly arm wrestling you know like this this one handle that i've been using it's definitely hitting a tendency to my elbow that i'm not familiar with or it's a little bit a little bit different than the arm wrestling tendons that normally get work when i'm arm wrestling so um it's definitely hitting some different areas that i'm that i'm used to and it's uh making me sore but i don't think it's um
John Brzenk: know affecting my arm wrestling i mean um it's hard to say i mean if i'm so early into it just you know just trying to get into it just for a couple weeks so it's you know it still might be i'm gonna stick with it but long term we'll see how it ends up turning out if it ends up benefiting or just ends up you know yeah i think i think that if you uh use it more for like health reasons
Engin Terzi: and less for specific training, I think it's going to help you. But if you try to record your max strength, you know, memory there, right? Because I have some negative effects, because right, you know, you know, better than anyone else that it is not the same feeling, you know, and when you when you go to the table, you're always training your hand with the like holding and one rep, not not like
Engin Terzi: You know, when you hold those handles, I think it is good to do it. Like my opinion that as a, as a, like healing health purposes, you know, you know, and some maybe assistant training, but, but if we think that, you know, it is our main training, I think there is going to harm, especially that you don't have such base. This is my opinion. Right.
John Brzenk: James Onley- But you know I have I have been doing for probably well since I started back for probably six months or so now i've been using the bands almost on a daily basis here. James Onley- You know, five days out of the week i'm at work and. James Onley- I don't know I it I don't know if it's actually helping or hurting because it definitely seems to be a little bit more taxing. James Onley- And i'm not as fully recovered as I normally would be when I when I you know pull again at the next practice so.
John Brzenk: It's definitely even just the high reps, high volume, and blood flow is definitely taking away a little bit from the healing ability. I mean, I'm not as strong or as sharp or as healed when I arm wrestle again. I could definitely tell I get sore a lot quicker. I might be overdoing it. I'm thinking about maybe backing off and just going like every other day with the blood flow thing.
John Brzenk: yeah i'm it's funny you know it's i've been arm wrestling for how many years now and um you know it's still 45 it's still yeah i'm still you know trying to figure out what's right what's wrong i mean i still don't know the exact science of it all and i'm you know as i've gotten older i've definitely opened myself up to you know the possibility of doing other things but i mean i don't know do you stick to the true do you think that what is right and what is wrong is also
Engin Terzi: is something dynamic that is changing uh to your like where you are you know maybe like like well if you are getting a little bit older maybe you may need like when you talk like what's right what's wrong like for example like rest in time it was totally different when you were 13
Engin Terzi: and totally different when you were 30, 40, and now it's different. So what I'm just saying, that people should not have like a static other people I'm talking about mind when they ask, hey, John, you know, what is right, or what? Yeah, right. Everybody, everybody's, everybody's different, obviously. Yeah. And the thing with arm wrestling is that it takes so long to, to advance and progress. It's not like weightlifting, where you've got that
John Brzenk: that that um that known quantity to know whether or not you're doing the things right getting stronger arm wrestling is so you know across the board you know that you don't know if you're improving and sometimes the improvement doesn't show up until six months a year down the road it's not it's not uh evident right away like weightlifting so it's it's definitely a different uh a different approach um and uh
John Brzenk: James Onley- yeah I like that I don't I don't have the answer I don't know you know I don't know if extra extra weights is is key or not or helpful or not, I mean many people would argue that it is, but in my experience it really hasn't been and I haven't really. James Onley- investigated that that much just because I have had so much that just from strictly almost. James Onley- yeah harder harder beer beer away from what you it's you know what you know and what's been successful for you so.
Engin Terzi: but I'm trying just in case that there is some truth to it. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, but don't, don't you think that you like your best performances, like 2006 Vegas, and I think you were also not bad in, uh, golden bear 98, even though you lost Alan career, but you had some killer metrics. Yeah. Like some of your really incredible performances.
John Brzenk: wasn't it like when you were like not 90 kilo but like 105 kilo or something you know yeah right yeah and i mean i mean i don't know if that was the best that i could be or not like to get back to the you know the cables and the handles and the training and i never really did any of that so i don't know if i could have actually even stepped it up to a another another level or not or maybe what i was doing at the time was what was absolutely possibly the you know the best thing i could do for myself so i mean it's
John Brzenk: just don't know i mean i mean how do you know i mean unless you you dedicate um you know months or even years to it and then even then it's not like i said it's not a it's not a known value like weights where you can say oh yeah i know i'm stronger doing it this way than i was when i was doing it that way and then of course you bring in all the different you know other factors the speed and the techniques and the you know the you know just the mind of knowing how to how to react where to go
Engin Terzi: which I think weights have always been kind of a negative in that respect. You don't have quite the sharpness as you do strictly arm wrestling. Yeah. Yeah. I'm mistakenly . Yeah. I was following somebody asking . I thought that I turned the light of the phone on, his son's phone. I turned the sound on. .
Engin Terzi: was gonna um but what i know about you every time we talk in last you know decades you said that you are confused when you go to gym you know and you feel more confident when you when you are at the table and doing what you are going to do at the competition so yeah so i i'm 100 believing that no matter how much you
John Brzenk: train outside of table you really need to transfer it to the uh i mean yeah yeah i still believe wholeheartedly that the best training is is having a team of a really good diversified arm wrestlers the big short tall you know um just all the different aspects that you would possibly run up against in the tournament and then of course even just the tournament experience is another another added you know plus to you know sharpening your skills to the you know the best of your
John Brzenk: the best you could be um yeah weights yes they're making you strong yes maybe you can push a little harder but that's so so one-dimensional it definitely makes you think in some respects a little you know the mind isn't quite there the way weights will never uh give you the coordination that you you can get from table and this is why i go to the table as fresh as possible because the table is not somewhere
Engin Terzi: to see how much we improved by lifting weight table is somewhere we need to transfer what we did in the gym to the table is is our real main uh training to create that coordination that we are separate the training in the gym there is a super chat problem thank you for super chat hi angie can you please ask john if he has ever pulled mike aiello officially does he think
John Brzenk: it is a potential pitcher match considering Mike has been over Toddzilla and Eric Spalter. Eric Spalter beat Devon Lara in office. So he is asking, do you think that he's just a good one? Yeah, so the first part of the question, no, I don't think Mike and I have ever pulled in an official tournament. The only time I've ever pulled Mike is after he had pulled, I think the day before, two days before,
John Brzenk: hard matches so he was pretty tore down and yes i think it would be a great super match if um anybody wanted to um you know set that up i would definitely be willing to pull uh mike in a super match um i know he's dangerous if he gets that you know shoulder roll in there that would be my i would do everything i could to make sure that doesn't happen yeah yeah he's dangerous but you know someone with good pronator like chen shaw just
Engin Terzi: kind of didn't allow him to use what he has uh right you you saw there like four way right yeah yeah yeah yeah that that yeah he's strong guy yeah he would be a good one yeah you'll pick up he's saying hello i mean hey how's it going yeah
John Brzenk: so how many days was today friday you coming on wednesday yeah what's today friday saturday so yeah seven days and i'm gonna lose probably seven hours so it's coming up on six days left for a match you feeling good you feeling confident no come on yeah come on come on i have a feeling i have a feeling you're gonna put a big shock in my arm the first match or do it i'm gonna i'm definitely gonna need to
Engin Terzi: No, I can't. But when I said that, you know, that's the only way, that's the only way. It doesn't mean it's going to happen. But if there is a change that, you know, maybe, maybe you, you, you, you know, switch, you know, your. It's funny. It doesn't take much. I mean, I think, I think you're close enough that we're, we're, yeah, there's a lot of maxes that are like that. I mean, if you're, if one of us is a little bit off and a little bit, maybe not,
John Brzenk: you know, still tore down from, from training or mentally isn't quite there or, you know, whatever. Um, yeah, that opened some doors that can really, you know, people then go, Oh, what happened? You know, what's going on? Come on. I mean, you can't be perfect all the time. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't put it, uh, I'm not, I'm not discounting the fact that you might bust me a couple of times. You felt really good in Turkey when we did some air pulling.
John Brzenk: after I just got even just a little, the slight pump with Zola. But it's there. I mean, that's the problem. I mean, you know, feeling that, I'm thinking to myself, oh, yeah, no, he's got some strength. No, I know. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, we were talking about now about Mike Aiello, the match and the possible one. And then I realized that
John Brzenk: Amir, like you come back, when was your chance match? July or August? I think it was June. June or July, yeah. Oh, no, not June. Not June for sure. June. Maybe June. Yeah. Okay. Okay. July, yeah. Amir? So I've been pulling. I've been pulling probably end of May, June. That's why I was thinking June. But, yeah, I pulled. Got some great workouts in Romania. Yeah, I forgot about that trip. That was fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: um so i'm i'm almost into it a year now yeah coming up on a year so i should be no not just like eight months eight not even eight months but what what i'm just going to uh point is that you know when i said things you know some people uh think that you know i'm extremely about you but i'm not extremely about you you know i i know if if i'm not going to be humble about this one but if there is someone who knows what he's talking about
Engin Terzi: uh i'm that person the barmas so what i'm just saying that whenever whenever i talk about you people think i'm extremely i'm not extremely but look at you i mean people think that you know and you just all kind of praise john or something it's not it's just like john just sorry but this is the truth you know when every guy look at look at look at alexey voivoda just just go ask rushtan baba go ask arsen lilliev go ask me go ask
Engin Terzi: they will not they all will say the same thing you know so you inspired all of us and even now look at when people are pulling once or twice a year you just came last july do you realize how many times you pull yeah you know that doesn't make any yeah it doesn't make any sense for me that people are you know that are doing that just i mean if you're into the sport and enjoying the sport and are um you know progressing and well trained
John Brzenk: you can pull, I mean, yeah, maybe you can't be peak, peak and, and be trained and rested, you know, every month, but every couple of months is doable. And that's why I have always have kind of had a hard time understanding how people just want a bit, well, maybe it's for their mental state. They, they got beat or it was close and they feel like they need that full six months to, to, you know, reassess and retrain and build. But, um, yeah, I always thought, you know, I've always felt like, you know, why not put yourself out there and,
Engin Terzi: i always felt that the tournaments made me better so um yeah good competition there's just you know sharpens the skills that much more so yeah yeah yeah so what i'm just saying to you is still being a good example and then showing people that you know you can pull you know a tough match even every month right this is yeah and you were doing there are yeah there are some negatives to that though and i mean like
John Brzenk: Like I was telling you before I made it, I mean, yes, the super matches are great, but it's also really difficult to be like super, super peak, like the full two and a half, three weeks or two weeks or three weeks of full rest. I mean, because if I did that between every super match, I mean, that leaves what a week or two of training. If you were like, just imagine if you were like 25 years old.
John Brzenk: 30 years old, would that be a little bit different that you know, you wouldn't need that much? Maybe you would still have like, I think, yeah, I think still two weeks is the is the always, but it's always been the key for me to, to mentally and physically feel like I was at my best. If I didn't have that I didn't feel like I was at my best. But I mean, I you know, there was that there was times when I was in my 2030s that I would go to a
John Brzenk: leonard denise tournament every other week so i mean i was actually using the the stress of the tournament and and really not doing any training other than just pulling hard during the tournament and then afterwards that was my my session so it was you know once uh once every two week training session but it you know it worked yeah yeah so that that is yeah that's what i said and then you we were going those tournaments and i'm pulling probably multiple weight classes
John Brzenk: Yeah, no, that was always a, it was always good training because, you know, like I said, even just, even if I didn't get the training during the, during the tournament, I would always pull afterwards real hard. So it worked.
John Brzenk: yeah uh is it true that you are now uh leaving your uh beard uh so that i would think that you you you are you know i'm older you look older and i will have mercy on you yeah i never let it go through the sides here but here in the last week i decided that even to let the side side beard go so we'll see how it turns out i don't i don't like the mustache thing and it's already starting to bother me so i'm gonna have to like i might have to trim that down but
Engin Terzi: i'm thinking about maybe letting the uh the chin the chin hair go yeah normally i look older than you but if you leave that that we will be very near at the age you know right yeah i will ask you some people a few other things you know about the the main super matches um okay like um just you can shortly say your opinion um like for example what do you think about dave chef in gennady
John Brzenk: Well, Dave has proven that he's been able to beat him before, so I have no reason to doubt that he wouldn't be able to do it again. I mean, I hold Dave in super high regard. I mean, as far as an arm wrestler goes and his strength and his hand, there's only a couple people that I think that with the right rule set that can even give Dave anything, any kind of a match. Yes, Dave's been beat by Michael. He's been beat by Devin in WAL situations.
John Brzenk: when their arms are making plays straight on the table. But other than LeBron, I mean, yeah, I mean, Davok to me has got to be the favorite going in to almost against anybody. But yeah, I mean, if anybody's going to, you know, beat him, it's going to probably be someone that has a great, great back pressure top roller, you know, top roller. And Genadi somewhat has that, but I don't think he's got the horsepower to deal with Dave.
Engin Terzi: but do you think that there is a chance that, you know, when Genadi pulled Dave, he was still pulling those WAF events. Do you think that there is a chance that he came to be like... Yeah, of course. Yeah, of course there's a chance. I won't say that Genadi has no chance. I just feel in my mind that Dave would be still the favorite. You know, I know Genadi's, you know,
John Brzenk: Evgeny in his match when he pulled Dave, he somewhat got out on Dave's hand a little bit. And if it sticks, it stops. Yeah, Dave has a hard time. Yeah, he has a hard time with that. He doesn't, well, it's difficult for anybody to adjust. I was going to say he doesn't adjust well. But, you know, if you get stuck like that and you're committed to the side pressure and your hand hopefully holding up, it doesn't. It's kind of a loss. You almost kind of need to let it go instead of fight with it.
Engin Terzi: I think they will both survive their pronator, but I think Dave's wrist will not really handle the pressure. But if they beat him like this, I'm not talking about dead wrist, but you know, with pronator, you know, then yeah, I think it's going to be a tough one. This is my opinion. Yeah. And I haven't seen Dave do that very often. I would think Dave has the confidence in his hand strength to be able to try to still keep his cup as he goes sideways.
Engin Terzi: yeah but whenever he he didn't really have like this but he was just like oh he didn't have a full cup no no no he was but he still was with the arm yeah yeah yeah yeah maybe that's how i remember you know yeah like more outside you know yeah right yeah for sure the mesh is going to go strap i don't think that you know again at his hand wrist will be like levels and yeah
John Brzenk: And what do you think about, you don't know much about İrakli, but İrakli versus Todd? Well, I mean, he showed himself to be really good against Tasho. So, I mean, I think Todd Hutchings is a very similar pool. I'd imagine that if you watch that match, their match might go exactly the same way. I think İrakli has obviously good chances to top-roll Todd and
John Brzenk: and put him in a very awkward, bad leveraged position. But, you know, Todd's a fighter. Todd will fight with a straight wrist or even a broken wrist, especially if he gets put in the straps. Does Rockley have the horsepower to come across the table and finish Todd? Probably not. Todd's going to be stronger than Samushia Owen. So, I mean, if Todd loses any, if he loses the first round, second round, he'll win the next four. So...
John Brzenk: yeah i see that match going very similar to i mean iraqi's obviously bigger and he's probably going to be stronger than the match that i saw him pull sasha so uh yeah he's gonna he's definitely gonna have chances against todd i mean for sure he's gonna have the chances todd's horrible does a great top roller he possesses that so yeah that that match is going to go strap for sure john because it actually without the strap is not like you know as dominant as
Engin Terzi: uh prudnik right if you say prudnik versus todd i would say that there is a possibility to have hard time to sleep but right with right exactly he will he will have you know that chance but i don't know if he's gonna go spinated hook pressure or if he is going to protect his tornado and with the flatness he will try to press him i don't know about right i would think that um i don't think directly is that confident where prudnik is probably confident enough to
John Brzenk: go in a hook and then top roll from a hook position from the go but rather directly he's probably going to just stay try to stay completely away from todd's hand and todd's arm you know like by going top roll so yeah so do you do you remember the guy the tall georgian guy that in moldova he had the final with the ukraine yeah yeah you know he's gonna pull uh michael yeah oh michael yeah
John Brzenk: yeah we i don't know what kind of i don't know what kind of horsepower he has but he had a great top roll um i remember him uh well he ended up taking second right he ended up getting beat by the the uh was the ukrainian that kid that beat me um what was his name moran brand are you talking about yeah no the um in moldova the guy that won the uh class the 95 kilo class yeah yeah yeah i forgot his name oh he's ukrainian yeah yeah super super strong super strong form i mean
John Brzenk: it was still close i mean yeah so yeah knowing what i'm feeling what i felt from him at that time that uh to be able to control um is it love red ass red ass rabbit rabbit what's his name red dead yeah did you see his match with levan from 2018 no no yeah you were like head to head you know okay
Engin Terzi: But most people can end up taking, you know, top rolling Todd. But do they have the arm to finish him? Yeah, that's the problem. So it'll be interesting. It'll be fun. It's always a fun watch. Yeah. You saw the last match I added, Matt Mask versus Morozov, left arm. And Matt Mask versus Tobias. Do you remember the guy, tall guy, Tobias from Sweden? He had a super match with Morozov. If you realize that Morozov
Engin Terzi: was not able to top roll him so he hook him i don't know if you watch or not but uh maybe you were resting yeah and so this guy has very strong hand power the the tobias and right when when he kurdesha beat him at pal kurdesha said that he felt tobias at least as strong as uh hermes
Engin Terzi: Because the guy's hand is strong. That is why Morozov couldn't top roll him. So he had to hold him low and hook him and beat him. But I don't think that Matt has the potential to go that way, you know, to hook him. I don't think that he's that good, you know, about hooking and taking inside. But he will have to go outside. So it will be the hand and back pressure. So...
John Brzenk: people think that it will be easy match for matt but it may not be that easy but we will see yeah yeah well matt's you know that he's running up against someone that is tall if not taller than him so that if that height advantage that he normally has is going to be taken away and we know from the past that that you know matt doesn't have the horsepower i mean sideways and hook that um
Engin Terzi: But it's cool to see that Matt's taking on the challenge of pulling some of the top Europeans. That'll be good to see how that turns out. Yeah, that is all my intention, you know, just to bring because for years, you know, they arm wrestle there. The others are arm wrestle here. And all the time people talk, you know. So now just bring them and let's them pull, you know, just this is my goal, you know. And do you know Ongar Bayer?
John Brzenk: Oh, yeah. Now he's back and healed up, didn't he? Did he fall off a horse? I can't remember the situation where he ended up injuring himself. You know, he's going to pull Marcio.
Engin Terzi: okay but he was hurt so i don't know what kind of yeah he was fully back now or his shoulder and he just recently competed a kazakhstan event and in two and a half months uh they told me he will be ready he will be under two to the limit and by the way you would have money right right to pull you up under 230 is it okay yeah yeah that's fine yeah yeah because the guy is like 100 kilo you know 220.
John Brzenk: uh yeah we've had this discussion i'm i'm i'm i need to start but like you say i need to start bulking up for pablo he's he's benching close to 500 pounds now he's looking at me i might find myself with my handful with him here in four weeks or five weeks whatever it is so the guy is strong if you make mistakes if he allow if if somehow it applies his power i don't think that it will be so easy
John Brzenk: don't think yeah well no it'll definitely be a good workout for me if nothing else good workout yeah yeah very good workout yeah i'll be hanging out for for dear life yeah you you talking about paulo pablo yeah of course well even even yourself okay no no because what i just said it when you say that it's going to be good workout but
John Brzenk: you sound like he stops if he's yeah well i'm just saying if he stops me i know it i'm going to be completely exhausted to try to i'll i'm you know i'm not going to get obviously not going to give up but it's just it could be definitely a long drawn out thing that takes forever so we'll see how his stamina is i know mine's not the greatest so but uh but it'll still be fun used to be your stamina used to be like best yeah it's against devil you know
John Brzenk: Yeah, no, I'm using muscles, I guess, too much instead of being relaxed and using the tendons that I used to when I was a kid. I don't know what it is. Of course, I get winded when I try to climb up a flight of stairs. So it's definitely probably age and heart related. I don't do any cardio, which is probably not a good solution. Super chat, Karoki. Thank you for super chat. Is John going to help Devin prepare for Levan?
John Brzenk: James Forrest, Norcal PTACC, he or she, by practicing. James Forrest, Norcal PTACC, Devin yeah definitely reached out to see if I would possibly come to Canada to do a practice, but I don't know if i'm going to have a time or not, if I do it would be after our match maybe there's a window there. James Forrest, Norcal PTACC, The end of March, maybe the first week of April that I could call. James Forrest, Norcal PTACC, Before my. James Forrest, Norcal PTACC, Papa but other than that i'm pretty pretty well booked for.
Engin Terzi: just doing a little bit of training and then resting up for my next super match. So I think, I think that if it has the training purpose and I think it would be good for your endurance, you know, because then when in practice is just like, like, you know, just,
Engin Terzi: Well, for training, but, but he will, I know he will exhaust you, but I mean, whether I'm just saying that you will be able to push your limits, you know, and increase the, I don't know if that's what you need or you need the explosive finishing for Paolo. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. No, I mean, there's a lot of guys that can push my limits now that I don't really necessarily need Devin, but Devin for me would be just nice to be able to pull fresh a few times, just, you know, out of curiosity and just
Engin Terzi: try to figure out some angles of what is possible and what's not possible, but yeah. Can I ask you a question, but just no like political answer, you know, just like straight. If you and Devon, 230 and Waffles, do you think that your chance of beating him higher?
John Brzenk: Oh, of course. You know, that's an easy answer. Chances are definitely be higher. Straight up, WAF rules. Him being lighter, for sure it's going to be easy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And especially if I continue to arm wrestle as much as I've been arm wrestling, I mean, I have no reason to believe that he would be that much stronger than arm beating in Vegas. Would it be easy? No. Do I have chances possibly to win? Yeah, of course. I think I would.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, because I would like to see that. I'm not saying that you would beat him or not, but do you realize that after some matches that you were not able to use your cupping hand wrist control, your wrist now kind of started to look better. You are more confident using your wrist for stem pronators.
Engin Terzi: unlike those those matches that you were just holding and just using pronators starting with the match with with zolev you started with the wrist and then your pronator even became more effective it just looked so i mean yeah right now the form seems to be the hand and wrist and wrist has definitely taken the longest time but you know i look back at my match with chance and i thought i was i thought i was in pretty good shape i've been pulling a couple months but
Engin Terzi: I laugh when I see my forearm. It was like, oh, man, you were a little thin, tiny thing. So, yeah, no, it's a process, and it's definitely been getting better and stronger. Yeah, yeah. You seem like you did everything you could just to win, and that was the only way you found it with your side pressure with the pronator that way. Yeah, that was the whole way you found it. Yeah.
John Brzenk: It has a lot to do with just even not only the strength, but just the uncertainty, the lack of confidence to be able to go up there and set up. I mean, maybe I could have done something if I would have, you know, approached it a little differently and went hand to hand and made sure I got the cup. But I was, like you said, mentally, I was just like, I'm going to hit this guy as hard as I can. And I forgot about all the fundamentals about securing the hand and wrist position. But, you know, it was still fun. It worked out. It was there, but you just didn't,
Engin Terzi: reach that that info here yet you know because yeah it was true and if you talk about your confidence like compared to the time of pulling chance to now where is your confidence if you think about your you know prime time if you think the chance match and if you think now where is your confidence if prime is hundred transit now are you like 70 80 maybe
John Brzenk: Yeah, no, I'm getting closer and closer. I mean, yeah, maybe I'm fooling myself thinking that I'm anywhere near what I was, you know, five, six years ago, but, um, yeah, with, with bigger and stronger matches, the better opponents, I, I, I, you know, I, I feel more and more like I'm in the, in the haunted and more and more, you know, confident, uh, yeah, with, with, with many matches, I get more and more confident. Um, yeah. And I gotta be stronger than what I pulled chance. I mean, I've been almost enough pretty steadily, pretty, pretty regularly.
John Brzenk: Is it that much where if I'm not mentally prepared that a chance could beat me right now? That's still a possibility. I think even when you're in shape and get really good, I mean, it's still such a completely prepared. But yeah, no, I feel I'm starting to feel more relaxed and more confident. It's definitely coming back with every super match that I have to
John Brzenk: to not be so worried and redlined and crazy off the go. I had to be reminded that, yeah, no, you can relax and you can, you know, sometimes it's actually good to give up a little bit to gain that hand and wrist. Yep. I'm more curious right now, like I'm more curious about your copying and my pronated.
John Brzenk: I'm pretty positive. I'm pretty positive that I would, I don't, just feeling what I felt with you air pulling it in Turkey. I'm almost, I almost guarantee that I would not be able to shut you down without the scrap.
John Brzenk: going to it's going to require the lock on on the lower wrist to shut that shut that down so you are you are not going to try without sir i'll try i'll try but i have a feeling that yeah well and from my experience you know i i know how to roll out once i get my wrist broke back so it's i don't i don't feel like i would you would have the hand control on the back of my hand to cut me and roll me so um
John Brzenk: yeah i'll try to hang out but i i don't think it'll be so if you think that it doesn't work you will pronate and go step yeah yeah yeah yeah i'll turn straight i that's that's the that's the training i've had from day pen long ago you know my wrist starts to go i go up higher and get out okay that's good good good to know yeah i mean if you want to secure it completely secure you have to have the confidence to actually help me a little bit crunch down on me a little bit if you do that then that gives me a lane an opening to
Engin Terzi: pronate on you so it's a fine line definitely for i i i think that if you jump hook you know and then if i hang you there i better act like i'm in trouble so that you will you will you will stop thinking about pronating out and then suddenly boom before you go out right
John Brzenk: Yeah, no, I've learned if my wrist is straight, I'm not doing this anymore. I'll let it go. I'll go to this. Yeah. You're going to have to secure the cup. Yeah. Brian, what's the damage and the memories? Thank you for Super Chat. Engin, the Enigma, the question is for you. How do you think you would do against İrakli? İrakli would kill me.
Engin Terzi: especially now when he is 105 kilo ripped when i'm 90 to learn pets he would just kill me literally and i don't even think that the gods will have easy time with him i really don't think no you will know i'm gonna have to i'm gonna i'm gonna have to hopefully keep getting stronger and better here between now and then that's that's uh it's gonna be not until uh august so um yeah the way the way it's gonna be
Engin Terzi: the way that you can beat him is the way that you pull your previous super matches not not so much um because he will be here very tough so you really need to skew your your back pressure and pronator and balance the match i i'm thinking the best possible way is you to just and then
Engin Terzi: leading that way. Yeah, outer side pressure, how you beat Dennis, how you beat Taras, you know, but if you just jump in, you know, you're just going to take you and you will not have the resistance that Tatashins will have there. You don't have that joint pressure. Yeah. But you say, when you say Taras and Dennis, I secured the cup. I had the cup in good hand or wrist position still. I didn't, that wasn't all pronation, outside move. That was
Engin Terzi: That was a cup with the cobra-style top roll. Yeah, that too. But sometimes, remember, they take your wrist goes like this, and then you pray after that. And I'm not talking about there are times that you hold taras like this and beat too. I'm not talking about that. But there has been times that you lost your wrist control. I don't know. Right. But you still had the pronator, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. No, you're right. You're right.
John Brzenk: of course i i know you more than you you know yourself so just yeah that that also worries me here and uh this week that i've been if anybody knows about my weaknesses in my life yeah i i you just just tell me one thing do you even have this much to worry about me oh yeah i know i told you i you know i told you in private that um um yeah you you you seriously honestly have really good chances of busting me
John Brzenk: um it may be even sweeping me if i can't like it maybe maybe maybe one round and then i will be the happiest person but i will yeah yeah it'll be interesting hopefully there's no betting there's not any betting on our matches devin didn't do any of that good good good because
Engin Terzi: I told Devon that long ago that I don't want any betting on my matches. It's against my belief. Good, good, good. Any other match they can. Anyway, so Norway will be great. Dave you been there before? Never. Been to Sweden, but never in Norway. John, one of the best ever places ever that I have been. Yeah. I was just seeing pictures of it.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. It looks amazing. Not like other places. It's unique. I mean, there are, I don't know, seas going into the, I don't know how to say, like so many seas look like you would think that they are like river or something, but hundreds of them, I think. And there, like side, there are hills like this. And then the older...
Engin Terzi: houses are on the hills you know you would just jump from there to the down you know and yeah you don't find many flat place any small flat place they made a city or town you know whatever you know and yeah we were thinking we were thinking about possibly even leaving a day early is it worth to maybe just hang out in bergen one one day and just kind of hang out and see the locals and see the town is there see there
John Brzenk: George Malavasic, Was that the airport a little bit distance from the city right. George Malavasic, I think, one and a half hour or two and a half or two hours. George Malavasic, Okay, so it's long so that might not work out as well, I said, I was just thinking about maybe going a day early and just kind of hanging out without you know. George Malavasic, Where where in in Oslo or something. George Malavasic, yeah no in Bergen.
Engin Terzi: Bergen? I mean, yeah, I mean, we can talk with them. See, Sunday is nothing. When are you going back? Monday or Sunday? I need to come back Monday. Rene's got to be back to work on Tuesday. There is nothing to do on Sunday. So maybe, maybe we go Bergen and then see around and then stay in Bergen and come back. Yeah, yeah, that would be good. Yeah. Yeah. And then we can, you want to talk about all those arm wrestling before the event or after the event?
Engin Terzi: uh all the what talking about arm resting you know you and i if we are in the same place of course we're going to talk about missing oh yeah yeah yeah we'll do it for sure yeah for sure we'll have to do a little uh meeting one last super chat and then i let you go big grow all right number one and number two best i've never put these elbows on a table thinking why does
Engin Terzi: John at 57 pulled more than anyone else on the planet since he came back. I think we need to ask him this question, not me. Why do you put your elbow on the pad more than anyone else at this age, 57? I don't know, because I can, I guess. I still enjoy it, and I feel that that's what makes it easy, a better arm muscle. So, I mean, that's
Engin Terzi: mean you're not going to get better if you don't put your elbow on the table is that is that because everyone's training system is based on gym numbers and this so they pick and this and that while you your main training is table training and you depend on it yeah yeah yeah of course of course yeah that's from my whole life so yeah anyways anyways john see you see you next week thank you for uh your time
SPEAKER_01: and all right yeah for sure looking forward to it well have a good time all right everybody take care thanks
