SPEAKER_02: Hello everyone. Welcome to the press conference of East vs West 3. Tomorrow we will be organizing one of the best events in the world with 13 supermatches.
SPEAKER_02: and with the best athletes in the world and tomorrow it is going to start at 20 istanbul time which is 13 eastern time and
SPEAKER_02: 10 a.m pacific time you know just remember this so before we start this press conference so i wanted to remind everyone okay so we are going to start our press conference and
SPEAKER_02: In fact, you know, last two days we have already been doing all kind of trash talks together with the athletes. So I would like to start from the
SPEAKER_02: first match of the tomorrow's event which is Derek Smith versus Artem Morozov. Artem is from Kazakhstan and Derek is from United States. Normally Derek was going to come here as a commentator and when
SPEAKER_02: Marcio Barbosa's opponent, Ongarbaev, he got injured from his shoulder. He was Marcio's opponent. And so we had to do some replacement. We changed the switch to matches.
SPEAKER_02: So Morozov originally was pulling against Tobias Sporong, so now Tobias will be pulling Marcio and Artem Morozov will pull Derek Smith. Derek, you came here with only like three weeks.
SPEAKER_02: preparation not even preparation because you had to rest as well and we know that you are not the direct that we remember from the past after you pull against tim bresnan and defeating him and so people started to think very highly of you but we already knew that you had incredible potential
SPEAKER_04: And where are you right now? And what are your thoughts about this match? My prep leading up to this, I've been training maintenance stuff to stay on top as much as I can. Luckily, I was trying to prepare for some matches, so it kept me in the gym. So my numbers have been good. Gym numbers have been good, generally. But since my team match, I've been looking for bigger and better opportunities, of course, to keep moving up the rankings.
SPEAKER_03: So I'm not disappointed with my form currently right now. I feel pretty good. The match was last minute for me, but it's okay. You know, when an opportunity like this arises, you can't say no. You have to take it.
SPEAKER_04: Of course, I jumped on the possibility to be on this table with these guys, these legends and stuff, and represent the West. So this is a huge honor for me. In terms of my opponent, obviously, he's amazing. He's done amazing things. I have a lot of respect for him. I believe that I'm at that level, getting to that level, and excited to show what I can do.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, are you here to be nice or are you going to fulfill some of your dreams? You know, are you starting tomorrow to do something? Just, sorry, to kick some ass? Yeah, I mean, I'm not here to go play dolls over there on stage. Obviously, when it's time to put in work, then it's time to go to work. And that's what I plan to do. Are you going to defeat him? That's the plan, yes. Yes, yeah, okay. Yeah, that's good. And Arthur,
SPEAKER_02: What are you thinking about this match? He thinks he, oh my God, he thinks he's big. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Even bigger than he thought he will be. Okay, like I said, yeah, he talks in the, how do I translate this?
SPEAKER_02: The bigger the bookcase, the harder it falls, something like that. Oh, yeah. So when he goes down, he will make...
SPEAKER_02: Lots of noise, huh? Okay, I understand. I want to ask him, you know, he also has a super match with left arm against Matt Mask. I'm not going to go into details because his turn will come, but which one does he think will be harder for him?
SPEAKER_02: It will be easy. He said it will be easy. It doesn't matter. Both of them will be easy? Easy, yeah. Oh, he said something better, yes. If the wild horse wasn't eaten in North America, he will be eaten in Kazakhstan.
SPEAKER_02: You haven't pulled many people from the West yet, have you, boy? You're still young, you've got a lot to learn. Okay, looks like no answer. So, you want to add anything more? Raimon, does he want to add anything more?
SPEAKER_02: He said, good luck and hope no injuries. And we'll see who will eat who and who is the young one. When you guys went to school, he was teaching.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. I want to go somewhere, since Matt got involved about this match. You know, Matt, did you share something that, you know, you knock on every door, looks like you are like a dead angel, and then every door has a name like Prudnik, Morozov, and then the blood was coming out, you know? Is it something that they just tagged you, or is it you also shared it?
SPEAKER_01: When you were in school, they taught Photoshop. When I was in school, they had typewriters. Photoshop, I don't know. I've been working with my hands my whole life. So all I know how to do is share, start a YouTube video, end a YouTube video. That's about it for me.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because I remember that his response was that, you know, like it looks like you kill all of them and then there was some blood. And his response was that, Matt, you know, if you are having some kind of like monthly period or something, use tampon, he said to you.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he said I was spending most of my time doing Photoshop. I read that and I said, what the fuck is Photoshop? I had to Google it to figure out what it was. So tell him that, you know, that thing, he didn't make it. He doesn't know anything about Photoshop. He said he understands everything, no need to explain.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. Anyway, so if we go to the next match, Marcio Barboza versus Sahip Caglar. Marcio is from Brazil and also American citizen. And Sahip from Turkey. It's gonna be a left arm match.
SPEAKER_02: And so I would like to share this that people doesn't know. Last event, East versus West 2, Marcio was going to pull here, and then he got COVID. So we had to cancel the match. And what people doesn't know here that only 10 days ago, Marcio again tested positive for COVID. So we had to make him wait. And then I told him to take an antigen test in the last moment before the flight.
SPEAKER_02: And so he tested negative. And then he had a very hard flight. He had like three hours delay, and then he came here. And then he had to go passport control. He didn't get visa. He had to go all the way back and get visa again. And on the way when he was coming, like two and a half hours taxi driving, and his taxi got broken. And then he had to change. He didn't have good experience. So Marcio, welcome. Welcome to Turkey.
SPEAKER_02: And what do you think about your opponent? Do you have any idea about him? First of all, thanks for being invited. I appreciate being invited for this kind of event. It's a pleasure to be here with all these legends. And yeah, it was kind of a trip. Yeah, it was. It was very funny. Like, first time in Turkey, it was like, okay. Yeah, ask Matt what's difficult. Yours is nothing.
SPEAKER_02: So, Sahip, I don't have much information. You told me he's a very strong guy. Originally, I wasn't pulling lefty, but you encouraged me. So, I don't think he's that good, right? You don't think he's that good? Maybe not. Sahip, he hasn't heard much about you. He says he doesn't think you're that good. Is there anything you'd like to say?
SPEAKER_02: Do you have a microphone? He says that you will learn here. How good he is, you will learn here. What does he have to teach me? He says he is going to kick your ass and you will learn who he is.
SPEAKER_02: I wish him good luck with that. He says that he also can wait. Yeah, probably he didn't say the rest but to kick your ass he meant.
SPEAKER_02: yeah anyways um so um i would like to talk about yeah evgeny prudnik versus tobias sprung this is one of the matches that are not east versus west matches this is east versus east matches uh match one of them um when i did the the youtube interview with uh prudnik he says that you know he doesn't give any chance at all
SPEAKER_02: Did you say 1000% you're gonna be Tobias? Don't reverse now. 85? Tobias, get the microphone please. Tobias, what do you think? He sounds unsure.
SPEAKER_02: What was that? He sounds unsure about how it's going to be, the results. You are unsure or he sounds unsure? No, he is unsure. Oh, okay, okay, yeah, yeah, I understand. He doesn't know about the numbers. So he doesn't... Listen, listen. When he was on the YouTube show, he was so confident. He said, 1,000% he's going to beat you. Now he's sat here, he's at 85%, and just wait till he met you at the table, probably you'll be shaking. Yeah, probably. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: First of all, I want to express my solidarity for my Ukrainian brothers and sisters. My heartfelt wishes to everybody.
SPEAKER_04: I hope this evil war will finish as soon as possible. I will also donate a part of my prize money to charity for the people in need.
SPEAKER_04: So, about the fight. Tobias is a good boy. He is a very good boy.
SPEAKER_04: You regret this tomorrow. He has a very big potential. He could beat Morozov in February. And he could beat me. But he didn't beat Morozov and he will not beat me. Yeah, but do you remember that before that match you said that? I mean... Do you remember that your prediction was wrong about that match? You said Morozov?
SPEAKER_04: Okay, okay. I want... I mean... Your... His potential is not work, you know? Is not work. Why? Maybe it is impotential. Not potential. Maybe impotential.
SPEAKER_04: We'll just see tomorrow. Yes, I did work on that pronator. No, not really. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_04: The match is five rounds, right? But tomorrow I will beat him six times. Or maybe seven times if you want. If you want. Only for him. Six times or seven times I beat him. This only makes me stronger. Tomorrow, okay?
SPEAKER_02: Okay, just tell me, are you going to beat him in all ways, like you talk hook, side pressure, top rope? I don't know. I can try. I will try tomorrow. Tomorrow you will try. Okay. I understand. So, Tobias, while you are, you have the microphone, and your right arm matches with Barbosa. Yes. Yeah. And what do you think about that match?
SPEAKER_02: I think it will be a very good match and Barbosa has been in the game very long and he has so much experience. So that will be a big challenge for me, a good challenge. So do you think that there is a possibility that he will mop the floor with you?
SPEAKER_02: mop the floor no definitely not no no so do you think that you know those americans are dreaming about that thing they're not mopping the floor yeah yeah he's getting old right he doesn't know what he's talking about it will be difficult
SPEAKER_02: Okay, Marcio. Okay, I think whenever I ask him which match, you know, normal private conversation, which match will be, of course it's not secret, but will be harder for him, Prudnik or you, if I'm not mistaken, he said Prudnik match will be harder for him.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I hate to give him the good news, but he's definitely wrong on that one. Yeah. He doesn't know what he's talking about, right? No, no. He's so young, and he looks cute. Yeah. So, unfortunately, I'm just going to put some brakes. Cute and strong.
SPEAKER_02: What's happening, Tobias? One of them calls you boy, the other one calls you cute. Yeah? You're going to show tomorrow something, you know, different than how they see you, right? I don't arm wrestle with my face. That's good, because everybody wants to... If you arm wrestle with your face, everybody's going to want to give you a kiss on the face, right? Yeah, yeah. Because you're going to arm wrestle, we're going to have a good match tomorrow, and...
SPEAKER_02: I think you have no chance, but we'll see you tomorrow. You don't give him any chance at all? Seriously? Just say how you feel. I feel he has chances, but in my mind he has no chance. Okay, okay. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_02: That's a left arm match. Also when I, again, you know, when I did the interview with Zurab, he is also one that said, you know,
SPEAKER_02: Like, he said he has 60% chance of beating John. And John has 40%, but he said it's because only he respect John. But whenever I ask about FAQ, he said it's 1,000%. We don't even need to talk about it. And Zurab, you are 100 kilo guy. Your opponent, today I asked, he said he is 125 kilo.
SPEAKER_02: And whenever I told him that he has no chance, he laughed so hard. As much as you don't take him seriously, it's the same. He doesn't take you seriously at all.
SPEAKER_02: He said he loves when the big guys lose.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he says that it is even better, you know, when somebody is so confident and loses, you know, he said that he loves to see that, you know, and tomorrow he will see.
SPEAKER_02: So we'll see, we'll see. Yeah, tomorrow. But Efe, you are talking about someone who told me, if he wasn't joking, he said he's going to gain 15 kilos more, and he said, set me up, Engin, with anyone except Levan. Tell him if he was joking about when he said that, when he gained 15 kilos and he's ready to pull anyone.
SPEAKER_02: No jokes here. So he is like, really, say today when I ask him, like, if you beat John, who would be your next opponent? Would you want Hermes? First he laughed and he said, okay, okay. So he wasn't joking, huh? He never jokes about arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, Ermes, what do you have to say about this now? You need to get involved. Come on, just... Ermes is speechless. First time in his life. What's that? What did he say? Zurab said, chill, we'll talk later. Oh, yeah. He tells you to calm down. He will take care of you later. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Anyways, so if we go to the next match, take Hermes' phone. I need to look at the list. OK, this is a very interesting match. Pauline versus David Samusha. And many of the people from the West doesn't know who Samusha is. Samusha is world champion in 165 and 176 pounds.
SPEAKER_02: And Samusha has won also Zloty Tour, also taking third place in the overalls of the Zloty Tour. And he gave very, very hard match to Sandri Sedis, who recently beat Chen Xiao. So, but that was 171 pounds from Zloty weight class. Samusha, now he's 200 pounds. And he has incredible hook. And then his opponent,
SPEAKER_02: Pauline also is a very explosive and very powerful guy that we saw that he gave hard time to John and he recently beat Rambat and he's a very explosive guy. Here, I would like to ask John, what do you think about Paul, John?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, obviously, super powerful. I had a sore tendon for probably a month and a half, two months after pulling Paul, so he's definitely going to bring a lot of power if it goes inside. And I hear it's going to start inside, right? They said so, but I don't know. That might be a mistake. For who? For Somerset? Yeah. Yeah, I want to ask you also, do you see...
SPEAKER_04: Paul Lee losing against someone inside when he opened his 20-pound lighter? Make no mistake, Paul can top roll too. So, yeah. So, during our match, he pretty much dictated where the match was going to go, and I just had to react to it. So, he's very quick and he's very explosive. So, his opponent should be ready for that. But do you see him losing tomorrow?
SPEAKER_02: No, no.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Ramos, John, you missed it. John said that he doesn't see Paul losing to Samusha. And I said, you really believe that? He said, remember, these guys are the mop, just to clean the floor. Translate in Russian. I have no idea how to translate that. Yeah, come on. They know it. OK, OK. Guys? John said tomorrow.
SPEAKER_02: You know, right? What? Artem said they came here to fight with athletes, not the cleanup crew. Yeah. Yeah, maybe they can clean after themselves later.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, they understand. I asked Samushi about he will be confident starting in a hook. He said, I think it should be a surprise where I'm going, but I have no problem if the match goes in any direction. Say it again. So, Samushi, we talked about Paul and Davids starting in a hook. Yeah. He said, I will not give away where I'm going to go, but I'm confident everywhere.
SPEAKER_01: So he's not going to start in hook, he says? Pretty much. Oh, okay. So we have a reverse here, you know. Okay, what do you think, Paul? I'm good with whatever. No, no, but generally, what do you think? Oh, okay. I mean, I've done all the research that there is out there to be done on David. I got nothing but respect. He's accomplished so much more in the sport than I have in the years I've been in it.
SPEAKER_01: So it's an honor just to be able to compete in this event and against a quality opponent like him. So my hat's off first and foremost. I understand. So how do you see the match?
SPEAKER_01: From what I saw in my research, I think David prefers to be inside deep in a structural technical hook, which is, I think, where the suggestion came to start there. I'm not opposed to doing that. I'm not opposed to starting in the strap, whatever, wherever. Ideally, if I'm going to lose a match, I want to lose because my opponent's stronger than me. So if he's strongest in the hook, it'll inevitably go there. Okay, I understand. So how do you see your chances?
SPEAKER_01: I think it's, I mean, I give myself, it's a toss-up. It's probably a 50-50. I don't have as much experience with Europeans, the WAF style setup, the WAF refereeing. I have some experience there, but I'll be learning a lot on the fly. So I think my weight, my size can be an advantage, but the experience is probably a disadvantage. I understand. Okay. Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: okay there is the other uh before we go to do okay another east versus east match arif ertem versus krasimir costadino arif is from turkey and then krasimir is from bulgaria arif is the wow super heavyweight champion
SPEAKER_02: And his opponent is 100 kilo world champion. Have you won 110 kilo as well, world? Yeah, yeah. You won 90 as well, right? 90, 100, and 110.
SPEAKER_02: 90 100 and 110 yeah and but he is recently right now you are 103 kilo and your opponent is about 150 kilo so he's like 50 bigger than you you have pulled before he has winning record against you and but but you are type of person that you know i know you very well you are one of the legends of our sport and
SPEAKER_02: you like to prove something that you didn't prove before. Like, I remember with 102 kilo, you pulled super heavyweight category, you beat Levan in the same event you had won against Gennady. That's the event that Arif won against you. And so whenever I offer you this match, you did not even hesitate. You're like, yeah, why not, you know?
SPEAKER_02: And I know that you also would like to pull Todd Hutchings to be the first ever Bulgarian. He said that he's a matter of honor in whole Bulgaria. Yes, he's the owner of Bulgaria so far.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, he is, yeah. He has beaten Stoyan Golemonov, Sasha Andreyev and yourself and recently Jordan Sonev, yeah. And you would like to pull him as well. So what do you, if we come back to Arif, and how do you see your chances and also,
SPEAKER_02: like, losing against... No losing, stop, stop, stop, no losing. We are talking just about... I can say like this, he's the favorite in this match, no doubt about that. He beat me three times already, so he's the favorite. He is the stronger guy. Probably he will have the advantage after the goal, but if the match stops, I believe I can bring it back, even if it's one centimeter from the pad. So...
SPEAKER_02: he will be the favorite but once if i'm able to stop the match all the chances are going to my side so your recent loss did it cause any kind of problem with your confidence
SPEAKER_02: Not actually. I realized that without the straps, I'm not able to pull against the heavyweights. Against the heavyweights, I need the straps. Doesn't matter if they're hooking or top rolling me. Just two big hands and too much pressure on my wrist and fingers, so I need the straps for sure with him also. Yeah. Do you find their style any similar against you?
SPEAKER_02: You mean a rift style to chorus? Yeah. Maybe to go direct pinning straight to the pad. It may be similar, but a rift's back pressure is a lot stronger than chorus. When the chorus is pure side pressure. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So when people are going directly to the pad, it is a little bit harder for you because you need to get a position to stop the match. It all depends from the opponent. Depends how strong he is, actually. I understand. Yeah. But once I am able to... If I'm able to control his pronator, then the match is going in my side, I think. Just to see if...
SPEAKER_02: he is strong enough to finish me after the goal or if I will be able to stop the match. And one more question. You recently lost against Laletin and then Corey. And this is your third match in a row against super heavyweights. So if you lose this match, do you plan to stick on your own weight class instead of just trying to hunt those big guys?
SPEAKER_02: My dream still is to be number one in the heavyweights, so I may be pulling this year off in the heavyweights with right arm. Oh, heavyweights with right arm.
SPEAKER_02: If they beat you, they beat you. That's it. You just continue forward. That's it. I understand. Not a big deal. So you want to do something that you haven't done before. Yeah, I understand. I have won 90 kilo class, 100 and 110. So heavyweight is the only class that is missing in my head. So I'm still aiming there. How do you see your chance against, like with percentage, how do you see your chance against Arif? Against Arif?
SPEAKER_02: I cannot say the percentage, just he's the stronger guy, but I will try to stop the match and bring it back. I understand. So you are saying that you have chance, but he also has chance to beat you. Of course. I understand. Arif, I guess you understood what I was saying. What do you think about this?
SPEAKER_04: We met with him before in the European and World Championships. He said that they have met before in the European and World Championships but it was about 6 years ago, right? 6 years ago, 2016. And? He won 90, 100 and 110. He seemed to win 110 with a heavy bike. I prevented him from winning then. I believe that I will prevent him from winning tomorrow.
SPEAKER_02: okay he says that at that time you won 90 kilo 110 100 kilo and 110 kilo and then you wanted to win the super heavyweight and if he wasn't there that day you were winning he says and he is the one that stopped you and then tomorrow he will do the same thing okay okay thank you thank you very much and okay now let's let's talk about
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, that's the thing. Matt Mask versus Evgeny Prudnik. And starting from here, I would like to also ask, you know, people who are sitting with me here and their opinions. Larry, I would like to ask you, you are, I mean, we can't call you new anymore. You have been involved in arm wrestling for some time already, and you did a lot for arm wrestling even before.
SPEAKER_02: During the COVID time, when everything was down, you started doing the king of the table. And because of your popularity, you also became a door, or I should say window, to the outside of armwrestling world. And then you brought a lot of new fans. Thank you for this, first of all.
SPEAKER_02: And right now, this match, do you follow these guys? Like, do you know these guys that we are, you know, here together, most of them? I know most of the guys here, yes, of course. And I will ask you, what do you think about... Whenever I say this match, in my mind, this match has, I mean, it explains for Chamberlain...
SPEAKER_02: He has pins over John Brzing. I know he has top-rolled Todd Hutchings. He has beaten Marcio Barbosa. He gave very, very hard time. He has, I think, pins against Devon Larratt. And he has defeated Hermes Gasparini in WAL. But whenever I set him with Evgeny Prudnik, normally Evgeny wasn't part of the card. He said that, you know, my country is in war. You know, I better not. And then later he said, I want to pull.
SPEAKER_02: you know, compete, so I thought that, you know, Matt would be a good opponent, but people thought that it was a mismatch, but Matt came here to prove everyone wrong. So, like, do you know these guys, and what do you think about them in this match? I know that every match I've ever predicted, I've been wrong.
SPEAKER_02: I'm always wrong every time, so I've stopped predicting matches. But I want to see Matt lose his shit. Not in a bad way, but he always gets super hyped up, just like Irma's over here, and that, I can relate to that. You know, I have to afford a big lift. One day I'm going to bring that to the table. I'm going to build my confidence up. But as far as, like, which side it's going to go on, I mean, I have to be on the west side. Exactly. I have to be on the west side.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he can beat him in any way. He said that he can beat him in hook, in the side pressure, in the top roll, in any ways. Do you see that that's simple, or you think that there is only a certain way for him to beat Matt? That's why I ask you, you follow them, you know them.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know the way Prudnik poses. Well, not that I know Matt Mass very well, but I've seen a few of his matches, most recently, of course, him and Hermes. And you said Prudnik has pins on Hermes, right? He was like 2,000 years ago. 10 years ago, yeah. So Hermes was half of who he is today.
SPEAKER_02: If we ask now, you're talking about that, you know, Prudnik has pins against Hermes. It was 10 years ago, but we're talking about we are in 2022, so we are asking about their level today. We can ask, you know, Hermes, where is your level? Can you show us with your hand? And where is your Prudnik's level? One more time. What's that?
SPEAKER_02: Now the question is coming. Where is Matt? He says, down even more. Okay, so you don't really know a lot about them.
SPEAKER_02: To be honest, not much about Prudnik. I know Matt can be very technical, especially in the strap. I think that's what helped him a lot with Matt and Irma's first bout. And, you know, maybe that will help him this time against Prudnik. They never faced before, as far as I know. Exactly. So there's that unknown factor, right? The few, the unknown.
SPEAKER_02: If you ask community, they see Prudnik heavily favorite. But some people, when I went to Italy lately, I talked with Ermes privately. And Ermes, when I asked him, he was not like, I said, how is this much going to happen? And he was like, hmm. He wasn't sure about that. So that is why I care about his opinion, because he has
SPEAKER_02: experience with both of them okay in fact he said that he pulled both of them and he didn't feel neither of them so this is why he thinks that he's not sure i'm just joking okay let's start what do you think about your opponent and are you going to say everything you said on the live youtube program can you say again here right to his face
SPEAKER_04: Tomorrow I can beat Matt Mask. Matt Mask, are you ready? Are you ready to be destroyed tomorrow? Tomorrow you could beat me, but will you? That's the question. Don't be afraid. I won't break your arm. I'm only going to mock you.
SPEAKER_04: You just got to get past my hand. Tomorrow I take your arm and I will totally control all your straight strings. So do you think? I wish you luck. We'll see if you feel as confident as you do tomorrow after the match as you do right now.
SPEAKER_04: I will let open my wrist and then I will do wrist flexion exercise. So that I can at least get some workout.
SPEAKER_02: If you can do that to me, I'll be fucking shocked. And I'm pretty sure you'll shock everybody else in this fucking room and everybody else that's going to be watching. But Matt, when a man says a word, when the word gets out of the mouth once, that has to happen. He has to try that, right?
SPEAKER_02: If his wrist goes in a positive position at all throughout the match, he's done a good job. So do you think there is any possibility... I am gonna fucking make his knuckles touch his elbow. Somebody is getting wild.
SPEAKER_01: What's your name? I've been trying to contain it for so fucking long and 24 hours, it's all fucking coming out. And unfortunately, it's all coming in your fucking direction. Yeah, yeah. Wild horse.
SPEAKER_01: The only thing I gotta make sure is I ain't fist-fucking no tables and I ain't stomping my feet. So I don't know what I'm gonna be doing when it all comes out, but I might be just standing there throwing F-bombs, I might lift my left leg off the ground and just smack my right foot on the ground, but something's coming out. And it's all coming your way.
SPEAKER_03: You are not wild horse. You're just only white pony. White pony. It don't matter. You're gonna be getting stomped. And I know after this fight you will be left without your curly hair. Did you come with notes? Did you fucking bring notes to this? Flip the page. Let's go to the next one. Okay, tell me that... He's got fucking notes.
SPEAKER_02: Tell me that after the fight tomorrow, okay? Is he pissing you off? I'm always pissed off. Like, always pissed off. Every time you see me with a smile on my face, it's just a front. Yeah, yeah. Looks like he's making you angry. Just save it for tomorrow. Anyways, you want to add? You want to say anything more about this match?
SPEAKER_02: You want to say more? No? You said enough, right? 85%, right? 85%. I'll show you a level I'm on tomorrow. Good luck. Tomorrow my 85% beat you.
SPEAKER_02: I'll take it. I'll take every percent. Matt, before we go to the next match, do you think that by saying he's 80%, 85%, he's just making already way for his excuses for the loss? He's already coming up with excuses. You can see it. You can see it, right? Yeah. You can see it. I don't see a whole lot of confidence in his eyes. So I can look deep into there, and there's not a whole lot of confidence. So.
SPEAKER_02: He's trying to build his confidence up, but it's not there. You know he's an actor, right? Oh, I know. He's a hell of a singer, too, and I think when he's done this, he might want to stick to it. Yeah, so... Okay, so looks like there's enough fire with that match. Oh, I want to ask your opinion.
SPEAKER_04: He's not going to want to hurt his feelings, so he's going to tell him the same thing he said on your show and he's going to pussyfoot around it. It's a very interesting match because I've never seen Matt Musk go in the hook. And he's very smart in the setup. I learned more.
SPEAKER_02: technique for this. Do you have experience? Yes, thank you Matt for this and I'm very excited to watch this match. Do people think that Prudnik is going to win? And do you agree with this or do you think that Matt also has a chance to win? For me 60% Prudnik.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, like this. Okay, but Matt still has a good chance. Yeah, yeah, yes, yes. Thank you. Okay, it's 85%. Yeah, and as a team captain, I would like to ask John's opinion about this. Okay, probably he wasn't going to...
SPEAKER_03: First of all, I want to clarify that Matt's Canadian. And as team captain, I think this is probably the biggest risk of us sweeping the eastern polar. So there's a lot of pressure on Matt. But I believe in him. I think he's going to have a big surprise for everybody.
SPEAKER_02: When you made that video, did you say American team or North American team? Of course I said the American team because I knew I had a wild Canadian in the bunch, but he's part of America. Don't worry about it. Matt, next time I will invite more Canadians to support your back.
SPEAKER_02: I think I sound American, but apparently I don't sound a little bit American at all. Everywhere I go in America, they always say, you're from Canada, aren't you? I say, how the fuck do you know that? I can tell in your voice, I sound like you guys. But apparently I sound nothing like them. I feel that as soon as John felt that Matt might lose, he gave up him for adoption. That's exactly what happened. He's like, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: It's not North America, it's America. Okay, so we go to the last four matches. And then after all this finish, I will ask people's opinions about the picking winner. Probably no. No, because everyone is going to back their team. Okay, Michael Todd and Ravaz Lutidze. Michael...
SPEAKER_02: until not long ago was amongst the very, very top guys. He is still one of the best in the world, but after his matches with Devon and Gennady, now people started to have doubts if Monster Michael Todd will ever be trying to become the very best in the world or not.
SPEAKER_02: And so now he has an opponent, Rewaz Lutidze. People don't know about him, but Rewaz Lutidze, one of the best top rollers in the world. And he gave probably the hardest time to Levan
SPEAKER_02: since 2017. He gave him a very, very hard match in Antalya, World Championships. I think he made a small mistake and then that match could be in his favor, resulting in his favor. So now these two, I will only share, first I will share my own opinion
SPEAKER_02: that Rewaz may be a little bit stronger at the start. But beating Michael has never been only about the strength. You need to have the key to open that lock. So that is the question, if Rewaz
SPEAKER_03: has that ability to finish Michael or not. So, Michael, what do you expect from this match? Oh, I've got a very big task in front of me. I think he's just as dangerous as Devin Organati. He hasn't been ranked because he hasn't competed since 2018, but I've been a fan ever since his match with LeVon, right? So...
SPEAKER_03: I'm hoping he makes a bunch of mistakes tomorrow. I don't know. I'm in a lot less, I'm in a much better position now because I don't have as much pressure on myself. I see this. I'm happy. I'm doing everything the exact opposite that I did last time because that didn't work out. But, yeah, I mean, he's a very, very dangerous opponent. If he beats me, he...
SPEAKER_03: He's a better guy. I mean, I've done everything I could in training. I feel good. I'm back to doing what I've always done, and it's train heavy and, you know, be ready for a war. So we'll see what happens. But, I mean, I think I got a shot. That's pretty much where I'm at. Do you think that the reason that you are very relaxed this time is because of your confidence? Yeah, I mean, I'm confident in my training.
SPEAKER_03: Does that translate to the table? I don't know. The last couple of matches, I did things different in preparation than what I had previously. And with this one, I just went home and treated myself like an athlete. So I'm fueling my body like an athlete. I'm resting like an athlete. I'm doing everything as I'm a professional athlete. So, yeah, I mean, I don't know if it's necessarily my confidence leading up to them. I'm never confident until I hear the first ready go. Once the first ready go happens,
SPEAKER_02: You know, the match slips in the center table, whatever, you know, I know I'm in the match, I know I deserve to be there. And that's when the possibility of the monster coming out, you know, happens, so we'll see. And do you, like, can we name your strategy tomorrow, patience? Well, yeah, I mean, so here's what I realized.
SPEAKER_03: is I got hated a lot for the Kingsman. I got hated, you know, for winning with the Kingsman. So I was like, okay, well, I'll just not use the Kingsman. Then I got hated for losing. And I realized if you're going to be hated, you might as well be hated for winning. So whatever I can do to win this match tomorrow, I will definitely try. Okay, okay. And what does Revas think about all this? Revas looks really sleepy. I think he wants me to win, too.
SPEAKER_04: He looks like a fan. From Georgian to Russian, Russian to English.
SPEAKER_02: He said, good luck tomorrow. Thank you. I will take it. All right. I told you you look sleepy. Okay, forget about Revas. Ask Gennady. Since they are friends, and Gennady recently pulled against Michael, what does Gennady think about this?
SPEAKER_02: He said that he knows Revas is in a great shape and he sees Mike is smaller than he was last time. But he said like Revas hasn't competed in such a long time that he still doesn't know. He'll give 60% to Revas, 40% to Mike. And it's not going to be an easy match to neither of them.
SPEAKER_03: I'll take that too. I'm cool with that. That's not bad either. 40%. He said that he knows how good Revas is right now, but he doesn't know how good Mike is right now. He said Mike can be stronger even though he looks smaller.
SPEAKER_03: So I've been getting this the whole time I've been here. I walk up, John walks up to me and I'll go and he's like, are you getting shorter? And then we go have dinner and Gennady's like, dude, you were way more intimidating in February. So I don't know if they're just getting in my head or whatever, but I'm fine with it. I'm all good. John thinks I'm a midget and he thinks I'm skinny. So whatever. Uh,
SPEAKER_02: there you go one thing that gennady said took my attention he said it's not going to be an easy match okay if it is not going to be easy match it means that he thinks revas will not be able to dominate michael so if he is not going to dominate the dominate michael it means that he will have to work
SPEAKER_02: against that desperation move. Epic move. It's his open top roll. Open top roll. Because if the shoulder goes below the table, it's a foul? That's why it's open top roll? No, no, no. But he's not going to do anyways. So what I just tried to say, if the match stops, he said, it's not going to be easy match. It means the match will stop.
SPEAKER_02: Does Gennady believe that Rabas has the skills to deal with that move as he did it?
SPEAKER_02: He thinks there's a chance that Travis can win from the start. But if it stops, he said he knows what to do. He has great technique. He also said he has good braiding, which means good endurance. OK. OK, if you think so, yeah. And I would like to ask John's opinion, Larry's opinion, Hermes' opinion, and Prudnik's opinion about this.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, all you have to do is do a search on the internet for Monster Michael Todd, and you pretty much got all the information you need to know. Yeah, he's got a lot of heart. He's very difficult to pin. You feel like you're in the match, and you're a million miles away from victory. So as long as he's in great shape and he knows he's...
SPEAKER_04: in for a really long war. Yeah, be prepared. He looks prepared. He looks like he's ready to fall asleep, so I hope he's a little more awake tomorrow.
SPEAKER_03: I think because he's a little bit rusty, the pendulum could swing in Michael's favor tomorrow. Yeah. Look, if he stops the match, then we know which way it's usually, you know, it's likely to go in, right? So, yeah. Yeah, I mean, Revoz is like mostly one-way puller. And then when a one-way puller is stopped by Michael...
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I don't see, I mean, I know that he has been training, but can somebody became that, like, well-rounded, Michael? Do you think, do you believe that, like, you have watched Rebels matches. Did you see someone, like, very well-rounded like Gennady? Okay, so I have seen him in Moldova pull Alec Tredesha.
SPEAKER_03: And he took the, he got his hand taken. Cadets went and took an open desperation Kings, whatever you want to call it. Yeah. Really bad. And he . I understand, but I will ask you something. Do you, can you really compare
SPEAKER_02: Alex open arm top roll with yours? Of course not. Come on, I'm not going to allow you to deceive people here. He's extremely, I mean, he's a long lever. He's got a big hand. He's got a strong hand. He has all the tools you would think that would be a bad matchup for me. But I do have a lot of heart.
SPEAKER_02: And I feel like I'm in a much better place right now. So I'm excited. We can do it right now. I'm ready to arm wrestle. You know, you know, before you put Gennady, you said that you will try to finish him quick. You wouldn't want the match to stop and start screaming, talking during the match. But I don't think, I really, what I will say, like my opinion that you don't really have that kind of worry about Rewaz when the match stops.
SPEAKER_02: Like, in your heart, do you really believe that he has the tools to finish you if you stop him? My honest opinion, me being as transparent as possible, if we slip, go to the strap, and my wrist holds up, I 100% believe I'm going to win. It's just whether or not that happens. I understand. But if you stop him, even your wrist is a little bit lost like this, but you still have the pronator...
SPEAKER_02: You still believe in yourself, right? Just come on. I'm not here to lose, but I haven't came to lose the last two times either. But yeah, I feel good. I feel good. And how much chance do you give yourself? What am I? 85.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so in my opinion, it's 50-50 whether or not he can crack me on go, right? If he does not, and he is not capable of getting me significantly out of position on go, I'm 90% going to win. Okay, I understand. But that's still 50-50 for the start, right? Yeah. So I just have to stop the match. And I have to stop the match in a position where I feel confident. I understand, I understand. Do you agree with all this?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, 100%. 100%. Again, one more time from Georgians, good luck. Thanks. They're like, what did he say? I said, like, 90%. They're like, uh-huh, good luck. I don't know this match, but if Revas knows the key for beating the King move...
SPEAKER_02: he have a good possibility if he knows it yes if he knows it but i think michael have a chance to win this match yeah which one has more chance 60 60 michael yeah i'll take that too
SPEAKER_04: I think at last competition Georgian man Gennady Kvikvinia won Michael Todd, yeah? And after he told about this Lutidze, how can he do this, yeah? And Lutidze know this, and I think Lutidze win.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Just passing the information. Do you think that after this match Rewaz wins and then he passed that knowledge to Irakli and Irakli beats him and he just goes like that? Huh, Prudnik? After this match Rewaz gives the same information to Irakli and Irakli also beats Michael then all the Georgians will give the information and it will be that simple?
SPEAKER_03: All Georgian commands beat Michael Todd, yeah. Okay, so what I'm hearing is if I lose, I get a lot more matches. Years of years, step by step, step by step, years of years.
SPEAKER_03: new man new georgian man beat michael todd do i get the same pay for each match because i'm i'm coming back then yeah i i i don't know if he's joking or not but i mean just because you're teaching someone it doesn't mean that he's capable of uh applying that okay now i'm doing the math and i've got like a lot of matches i'm gonna be here till east versus west 10 apparently so i'm good yeah um
SPEAKER_02: I will just go to the next match. And then I would like to thank you.
SPEAKER_01: And I'm trying to find a match, but it just keeps getting tougher every day. But I gotta do my part, cause I know in my heart, I gotta please my sweet baby, yeah. Well, I ain't superstitious, now don't get suspicious. Rock Lee is a friend of mine. And I know that it's true that all the things that I do, I'm gonna pat his head in my sweet time.
SPEAKER_02: Can you ask Irakli? Gennady said you have beautiful singing voice. I was only one of them.
SPEAKER_02: Ramos, can you ask Irakli, did he like the song? Yes, of course. And does he have anything to say about this? He said he needs Todd to sing after the match also.
SPEAKER_02: He wants Todd to sing after? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. But he also said that he will not be... Okay, he means that he will not be in a mood to sing after the match, yeah? Yeah. Anyways, yeah. Can you ask him what does he think about this match? But just honest opening, is he confident to win?
SPEAKER_02: I really need to see it because I have to be concentrated .
SPEAKER_02: He said, there's no chance I'm going to lose. I'm going to win. And he said it multiple times. There's no chance I'm going to lose. There's no chance. Yeah. Yeah. He feels that confident. He's that confident. All the percentage. So it's not like 85. It's like all of them. Yeah. See, did you hear that? You see people, how confident they are, Prudnik? Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think they're just talking between each other. Yeah. Anything to tell you? Nope. No, they don't tell you. Okay, if Todd beats you, I ask you this on the YouTube program, if he beats you, do you promise that you will allow him to?
SPEAKER_02: He will win just for that, so he doesn't have to have that. He doesn't like that. I understand. But that's extra motivation. He said there's no chance, no chance, no chance. I understand, but on the YouTube program he said if he loses, he's going to allow.
SPEAKER_02: He said, just for that reason, again, he will win. He's going to win and there is... He will do everything not to be in that position. Okay. Can you also ask Georgians what they think about John's opinion about the first he said he's going to, you know, they are going to sweep them and then they are going to, you know...
SPEAKER_02: Those are fantasies. Those are just fairy tales. The biggest fantasy of them all. Yeah, yeah. That will not happen. That will not happen, yeah. So they think that John is joking.
SPEAKER_03: Of course he's joking. No one would think like that. Yeah, one second. Very joking. First of all, I'd like to say the East definitely has a lot better hair than the West. But unfortunately, great hair doesn't win arm wrestling matches. And this group might be old, but we're very experienced. And I think there's going to be a lot of head rubbing going on tomorrow with Rock Lee and Todd Hutchins.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I'm dead serious. The Canadian is the wild card. If he comes through, he's going to be early in the rounds. If he comes through for us, I got all my money on a sweep.
SPEAKER_02: And one more question. Did you mean these only Americans who are going to face the Georgians, or is it for a whole American team? No, no, just listen. OK, do you count Barbosa from US or Brazil? USA, yeah?
SPEAKER_02: I see you as an official citizen. Show them your card or whatever you get. I know, I know. But whenever I ask you which flag to put, you said both of them. So since you can represent two countries. So you are saying that except Matt Mask, there will be a sweep?
SPEAKER_02: Just get the microphone and talk.
SPEAKER_02: Just give him the microphone. What did you say? I said, fuck you, John. Second, after I'm done mopping the floor with Prudnik, I'm coming for your fucking ass. What kind of team captain, huh? Terrible. OK, OK, Todd.
SPEAKER_02: You know, when you are alone, you are very, how to say, like, you're doing crazy things, you know, on YouTube with cameras, but whenever you are in front of many people, you are a little bit shy or I'm mistaken? No, I'm shy. We should get him a bed to jump on. I'm just so misunderstood. Yeah. And what do you think about Iraq?
SPEAKER_01: I think his words are soft and beautiful and gentle, as if spoken from a little kitten, and I love patting kittens on the head.
SPEAKER_02: They didn't answer. He said, good luck. Good luck. I was just translating that cut part, you know. OK. OK.
SPEAKER_02: He said, the problem is you don't have hair, that's why you want to do that. Yeah. I paid all my dues when I was younger. And Todd, what if Rackley beats you? Will you allow him to do the same thing to you? Huh. That question's never been asked before. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Sure. Sure you'll allow him, yeah. And if you beat Irakli, you have your next match against Prudnik in August. Will you also sing for Prudnik? I'll probably do a dance. You will dance?
SPEAKER_02: And okay, okay, okay, we came to a different point. We will go back there, but Pritnik, you said you're gonna be taught in every possible way in August, and then last round, you will go inside the slow hook, and you will still beat him. I ask this because you were very confident about Tobias when you came here. You were a little bit shaky. Can you repeat the same thing again?
SPEAKER_04: Tatachins, how you will beat him? Can you say to right into his face? Like tell engine 3z I win you and hook slowly.
SPEAKER_04: I will you quickly and top roll with this whole technique and I play with you at the table. We'll be playing with you. I have friends.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so I win him everything. So he's not at your level? For him, I will be prepared 1000%
SPEAKER_02: So this means that you take him very seriously. He's a very serious opponent for you. I have a question for you. Under 110 kilo, who is the most serious opponent for you in the world? For you, under 110 kilo? How kilo?
SPEAKER_04: 110, Irakli will be a great opponent. Your toughest opponent, in your opinion, can be from the East? No one from the West? So pretty much he said that Irakli will beat Todd, yeah? No, no.
SPEAKER_04: I think maybe if Ermes Gasparini less weight, 110, but I can beat him. So you cannot beat Ermes when he is 125 kilos? Can you beat him?
SPEAKER_04: If he will be 110, I can beat him easy. And I beat him now, but if he will be 110, this will be nothing. So you are saying that if he...
SPEAKER_04: I'm always not serious, but I beat at the table always. When do you want? November? In November, okay, November.
SPEAKER_04: I'm preparing for November. But in November, weight limit or no weight limit? Weight here must be 110, and I am 130. Okay, before we go there. Can you be the mic? No, it should work.
SPEAKER_04: I can rest pulling with him with no limits weight you will pull him yeah yeah but but remember he he wanted you to beat first Gennady if you beat Gennady then you will beat him yeah yeah Gennady prepare
SPEAKER_02: One more question. No, no, no, no, don't leave the microphone. So you are not taking, you didn't take Tatarshingh seriously. You are not even taking John seriously, about 110 kilo?
SPEAKER_04: 110. John is very interested much. But you said the most serious opponent is Irakli. So Irakli for you is more than... Irakli Jung, Irakli Jung man and very strong. I take him hand, him arm and feel this is strong, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But for John, you think... With John, I don't take him arm. I take, but I don't rest with him. So your chance against John is more? I don't know. But I think Iraq...
SPEAKER_02: more strong for you more dangerous for more difficult more difficult yeah what what so you by this i understand that you said you're gonna beat tatashins easily you say in august and you are saying that iraq is very tough opponent so you believe that tomorrow iraq is gonna beat that i think yeah iraq they can beat uh hutchins yeah yeah on on like john what do you think about this match
SPEAKER_03: Well, I think it scares him to think that not only Todd will be directly, but then a month later, two months later, I'll be directly. So he's going to have to do some recalculations on the two top 110-kilo guys here shortly. And what do you think about those? Well, I think Prudnik might not even be in the running for the 110 championship. I think it's going to come down probably to Todd and I in November. And we'll prove that here shortly.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you can. But you are not confident. The other day on breakfast table, you were saying that, oh, why the limit is 110? It should be 105. Remember? Okay, okay. Okay, so why were you complaining that day about 110? Come on.
SPEAKER_02: Say again? Because every time when we pulled at Zloty, it was 105, that's why. But 110 is fine enough for me. I think that while we are all talking, Matt is like thinking that, you know, you guys talk about like, you know, I'm not here, but tomorrow I will make you guys realize who's the boss. Right, Matt? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just going to let them dream right now, that's all. Yeah. They can battle it out, and then it'll all be coming to light come tomorrow. Yep. Okay. No, no, no. I want to ask Todd. I want to ask Todd. Todd, what do you think about all this? Just come on. Just say something to us. You can even sing for us. Good luck. Anyways, so, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: OK, so we are going here now. Dave Chaffee and Gennady Kvikvinia.
SPEAKER_02: Yep. Dave, you and him pulled, what, four years ago? Yeah, four years ago. Four years ago. And since four years, you said that, you know, he has been, you know, creating excuses for his loss. And you said even when you beat him in one second or two seconds, he was just making a, like, hand sign, you know, like he was that close to stop him or beat him or something. And, like, do you think that he was that close to you that day?
SPEAKER_03: You can watch the match. I don't think he was that close at all. I beat him pretty quick. First couple matches he did this. I wasn't really sure why. I got an elbow foul. He beat me twice. I won 4-2. Once was an elbow foul, and I was gracious enough to let him win the last match. So 4-2 was the final. It's going to be 3-0 tomorrow. That's it. He's been talking for the last four years.
SPEAKER_03: and it all comes to a head tomorrow. That's it. No more, no revenge, no nothing tomorrow. It's over. Tomorrow, tomorrow, no, you're playing around. There's no playing around. And then tomorrow, you're going to beat him so convincingly that he won't be able to create more excuses. Well, here's your percentage. Your percentage is, for me, 100%. I'm going to tell you that, and he's going to tell you 100%. It's going to be two freight trains going at the table tomorrow head-on, and I can't wait. Yeah. Translate, please.
SPEAKER_03: He said, where's the belt? Where's the belt that you won that time? We already discussed it. It's a PAL belt. I couldn't bring it out.
SPEAKER_02: Last time you said that he has no chance at all. He said no chance for Dave. He said he's going to beat Dave. And then Dave said that his T-shirt is too tight, that the blood doesn't go to his brain. Does he have any answer for that?
SPEAKER_04: He says 100% he's gonna win. Shocker. 85. And if he wins again...
SPEAKER_02: He's thinking that he's creating so many excuses for his last loss. If he wins again, is he going to accept that he's the man?
SPEAKER_02: no chad's good luck no chad's good luck yeah game on yeah um what do you think about this match just i know you're from the east side now you're sitting but hey people are saying you know what people are saying people says that
SPEAKER_02: Hermes beat Gennady, Alex beat Hermes, and Dave beat Alex. So he says that, they say that Gennady has no chance against Dave because of this. Do you agree with this? Gennady don't, what, sorry? Dave says that you beat Gennady, and Alex beat you, and then Dave beat Alex, so they are saying that
SPEAKER_02: Dave is going to beat him easily. What do you think? Does it work that way? It is very difficult, these things, because normally you are not in your best shape ever when you compete many times. If you compete many times, you have a possibility to lose one super match.
SPEAKER_02: Now my shape is not the same when I fought with Alex. And I root for Gennady because he's my good friend, but it's a very difficult match. And if we win tomorrow, I think the last super heavyweight I beat...
SPEAKER_02: For the next event, I want David Chaffee. Can you beat him? Sure. Sure? Yes. But if Gennady wins, would he pull Gennady again? If Gennady wins?
SPEAKER_02: You know, since I am the one who is setting these matches, I think that it would be too early for them to pull again. I think that it needs to be early next year, not the next event, because they just pulled, like, some months ago. Yeah, it's kind of too early. But, yeah, next year. And, Dave, if you beat Gennady, who do you want to pull against? Is Hermes one of them, or is it Laletin, or...
SPEAKER_03: I'm just going to worry about Gennady first. I'll pull whoever's in my way after that. But tomorrow, tomorrow we'll find out who wins. I'm going to worry about Gennady tomorrow. That's it. Yeah, you don't want to talk anything further. You are just concentrated. And can you... Oh, he said that because you are scared. Of what, you? Yeah. All right.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, can you ask him if he also, what does he think that people say that, you know, Hermes beat him, Alex beat Hermes, and then they beat him. Does this make him automatically heavily underdog in this match?
SPEAKER_04: I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_02: He said the match versus Ermes was the first match in four years for him to come back. And he said, like, his body felt different, and now he's kind of getting into it, and he feels better. So he doesn't think about that match that much, and he would love to run it back at some point. I mean, he feels stronger, more confident now than he was on that match. I understand. Last time, you know...
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: He said he knows Ermes is in different shape right now, even better most likely. And he said, but he is also, he said that it was very hard coming back from the long lay, you know, and now he's ready. And he said, whoever he faces now, he will do way better.
SPEAKER_02: Last time he was here, he pulled Michael Todd. Before he pulled against Michael Todd, on the press conference, I was also thinking that Michael was going to win. And I just turned to him like he said he's going to win. And I said, do you really believe that you can win? You are just trying to hype? And he said, yeah, he's going to win. I didn't believe him. And then next day, he won. And is he as confident as the last time he was against Michael?
SPEAKER_02: Uh, did you...
SPEAKER_02: He said it's the same. He feels the same. He feels the same level of confidence. He said it's 50%, like 50-50. If we compare both of them, he's like, my confidence there and now it's the same. Okay, yeah, okay. And Larry, I know that you are also organizing events, and I know that you hosted both athletes, Dave and Gennady before, and most likely you will be organizing events for them in the future.
SPEAKER_02: You want to have an opinion about this match? Like, are you going to root, since you are from the West right now, or you are going to be more objective about it? And can you tell us your opinion about Dave versus Kennedy?
SPEAKER_02: Sure, and I don't think it's too important who beats who, and that means they can beat so-and-so, because everyone here is passionate about the sport and is constantly leveling up, refining their craft. So it really can't go either way. I think it's going to come down to who gets the better sleep tonight. Dave looks pretty revved up. I don't think he's going to get any sleep tonight. I don't know what's in that drink. But...
SPEAKER_02: John over here as well. Yeah. But I feel that because Gennady had quite a bit of a layoff, you know, he's still making his way back to where he was at his peak in his career. So I think the pen is going to swing more in Dave's favor tomorrow. You know, Dave seems really confident. Yeah. Did you not see Gennady almost ready when he pulled Michael?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, of course. But like I said, like, who will be two, I don't think is really important. I think what matters is the day of, because everyone's constantly getting better, you know? You know? Can you ask John?
SPEAKER_04: Well, it's just nice to hear that they're both coming in with the kind of confidence in the fact that they feel, both feel that they're the strongest they've ever been or stronger than ever. So I know Dave's on a terror roll right now, and Gennady has definitely leveled up in the last few months. So it's going to be definitely a train wreck.
SPEAKER_02: OK. We just heard from John who said that they are going to mop the floor with the Eastern guys. Now saying it's going to be a very hard match. So the closer the competition is getting, closer to the reality, the team captain is getting close, I think. Is that the case? I'm still going to make some mopping going on. Anyway, so Prudnik, what do you think about this match?
SPEAKER_04: I think Dave Chaffee is very strong, very strong, but Gennady is very smart in technique, and I don't know if it's a very great match. I think Dave Chaffee is stronger, but Gennady maybe can find KSK for wins.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know, it will be a very interesting match. And do you think that Gennady can stop, Gennady is strong enough to stop Dave? I mean, you can be smart, you can be very technical, but is he that close in strength to stop Dave at some point?
SPEAKER_04: If he can stop Michael Todd, I think maybe he can stop Dave Chaffee.
SPEAKER_02: Michael is not an offensive puller. Michael is mostly defensive puller, so we knew that that match was going to stop anyways. But Dave is more like, you know, for more offensive pressure, yes. So it's a little bit different, yeah, that's what I'm thinking. So if we go to the last match, John Bersink versus Zurab Taveridze, okay, according to the majority of the fans, this was a mismatch.
SPEAKER_02: And people, even Travis Badgen said that when John Burzink, can you translate at the same time to Zurab? When John Burzink and Zurab Tawberiza match was going to happen, he said he was going to go to the kitchen and eat something and skip that match. But until he saw how confident Zurab was, what he said on the YouTube program, that he is now 50% stronger, he had COVID, now he's much stronger, and he's even targeting to beat the...
SPEAKER_02: heavyweight guys, and now people are thinking maybe he knows something, but we don't know. Can you ask him, he said that there is no joke in his words, but is he really as confident and is he really as good as he portrays himself?
SPEAKER_02: He said after the round match, he had two and a half months to train, to prepare. He's in way better shape and he believes he will win. He will win. And today when I talked with John, John, would you go to directly start in strap with Zurab? He said, yeah, he would start. What does he think? He would like to start in strap?
SPEAKER_03: He said, yes, let's do that. John, you still think that way? No, I mean, I want to test all the different options. So I definitely would like to attempt to get a grip without the strap the first match. Obviously, if we can't, you know, hang on to each other, well, you know, that's the second option is the straps, of course. But, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, no, I'm not going to, you know, tell him exactly. Let's just stick with this one strap match right from the get-go, from the beginning to the end. So I'm here to explore all the different options and ability that this man possesses. So I'm going to test out of the straps, in the straps, and then hopefully finally a few matches in the hook.
SPEAKER_02: I have a question for you. You said that if you make 2-0, you win it. In the last match, you may try hook against him. Is it going to be the case if you win first two rounds very convincingly? Or even if it is hard for you, would you see a risk to go to inside if first two rounds is a war but you won?
SPEAKER_04: No, I want to test his insight. So, I mean, even if I win the first two matches, and I'll promise him this, when I go to the hook the third match, if I lose, I'm going in to hook the fourth match, and I'm going to go in to hook the fifth match. Yeah, one crazy man here. It's just a little...
SPEAKER_02: He said that that means he will lose. If he goes just in the hook, he'll lose. So he's saying that even he's losing 2-0, and then if the next three rounds, if they go to hook, and it means that John is going to lose 3-2. Yes, that's exactly what he said. Yeah, but does he think that, you know, the match is going to come to a point to be 2-0 in John's favor?
SPEAKER_04: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: He doesn't think so. He said, like, I don't feel like John's going to win 2-0, and then, no, no, no. Yeah, okay. I will ask the opinions of this gentleman, and then we can finish the press conference. Larry, what do you think about this match? Do you know Zurab? Do you know who he is? Frankly, not familiar. But I want to ask John a question. How do you feel your conditioning is versus when you faced Devin most recently? I'm in better shape.
SPEAKER_04: I've progressively gotten stronger and stronger every month since last June.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, then. Yeah, exactly. That's all I need to hear. Yeah, but do you remember Zurab's match with Rambet? Do you remember the long match on East versus West? You don't remember, right? That match was like 40 minutes long, and Rambet is someone that has, like, if John beat him, like, four times, like, Rambet beat him once. Can you say that much? Like, you are about, like, 4-1 against Rambet. I'm just saying if you beat...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You said that your shape is better than the time that you pulled against Devin. So, okay, this is not about this match, but I want to ask if you would pull that shape of Devin, not the one that is getting ready now, you would have a better chance right now, is what you are saying. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: yes yeah okay so uh zurab said that uh you should not look at the match versus run bad he said he wasn't prepared for that he felt terrible it will give you zero data and that does really believe that he's 50 stronger now maybe more
SPEAKER_03: So in my opinion, I think his training is all wrong because all I see is his biceps getting bigger, you know, and his lower arm, his hand, his wrist. Yeah, isn't very impressive. In fact, I think when he goes shopping for gloves, he's normally, he's probably in the women's section, right? John, he said, don't get angry. Don't get angry. Did you translate what he said?
SPEAKER_02: He understood that. He understood that when he goes to shopping, he probably goes to the woman's section? Listen, listen, because of hand size. Don't take him wrong.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. He got it. He got it. And he's going to, remember, whenever he was talking that way against him, the guy from Texas, Jonathan Breda, and he said that he's going to make him pay at the table. Is he going to make John paying for this, his comment at the table, or his?
SPEAKER_02: He said most important thing is big bicep and big shoulders, okay? His bicep won't have any pump. I won't pull on those biceps. They're just a big waste. He brought them along for no reason. Okay, I will ask this gentleman, the last two. What do you think about this match, John versus Robb?
SPEAKER_04: For me, the favorite is John Brzezinski because I think he has more control of the hand, hand control. But maybe Zurab has a possibility for endurance. Do you realize that in the last Supermatches, John starts the matches except double...
SPEAKER_04: His opponents are getting tired and John is getting easier and easier wins against them. You realize that, right? Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so you think that John is going to win or still Zurab has a chance? Yes, I have more possibility. 60 maybe? 60, yes. I think first step John Brzenko open the wrist Zurab
SPEAKER_04: and after that's all for john this normal situation and he can beat the rub if john has now very great into endurance but if he can't he he has not very great endurance the rap has a chance chance
SPEAKER_04: Without wrist, wrestling without wrist. It's possible, but John can't control center and wrist at first time. But if he has not very great endurance, he can give a chance to the rep.
SPEAKER_02: But John wins it 70%, I think. Anyways, guys, thank you. Thank you for this meeting. And tomorrow, the real, real battle will start. Now everyone said whatever they want to say. And tomorrow, we will see who is better.
