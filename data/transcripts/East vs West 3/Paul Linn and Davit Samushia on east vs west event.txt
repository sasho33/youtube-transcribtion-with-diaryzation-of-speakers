SPEAKER_04: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: hello guys sorry for the um audio problems how are you paul i'm good you got me are you okay yeah yeah yeah yeah good to see you good to see you david join us okay thank you guys um i want to i want david to join but looks like he's trying to
SPEAKER_01: So how is everything going, Paul? You ready? Very well, very well. Very well. Let me, I'm going to try and see if I can get on my phone and see how the chat's going. Okay. The comments say they got our audio now, so I think we're good. Just one second. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: think we lost you hanging i think yeah no audio when you got the headphones in i think i can hear you now okay good good good good yeah okay uh i didn't disable the super chat that i'm not good anymore for monetizing it says that i use the reuse stuff which is not true i'm always using my own stuff but
SPEAKER_02: i i heard a bunch of people are going through that and it's real questionable i think they're having to like uh appeal it through youtube yeah yeah yeah i i think youtube is acting cheap i think they don't want to they don't want to give people what they deserve you know because i did appealing and then they check it and they said still is the right decision like how is it like what video what what video
SPEAKER_02: No, they don't even say which video. That's crazy. Yeah. And they say the majority of my videos are reused. Like it's all my interviews or my prediction videos or events from my, I mean, videos from my Supermatch event. Maybe a few videos that, you know, either from the chest that I am involved from the friends, you know, but I remove them too. On May 15th, I will again apply.
SPEAKER_01: monetize them let's see let's see what they will say what they they are like i think i think they're i think they're making like knee-jerk reactions to like people posting any video while talking to them you know what i mean like voice over i mean i i've heard several people having the same issue with facebook too um doing like um the commentary on a video of somebody else's video and then facebook demonetizes them so i i think it happened to ryan bowen which is a significant hit for him
SPEAKER_02: yeah i think that if face uh youtube does this to like just say to a million people for a month i think they will be saving good money that's probably what they are doing yeah it's probably just a power move making sure they let us know they got control i don't know i don't know the reason but it's just they may make mistake but whenever they told me the final decision they said okay we check it a real person check it and
SPEAKER_02: The decision is right decision. I was like, how crazy? Yeah, my videos are so bad. My videos are so bad. They're just like me lifting weights and stuff. They can't I don't think they can come after me. Yeah. So there are a lot of things that people are asking if I'm going to cancel the Ryan Bowen
SPEAKER_02: yeah i just read it nonsense and ryan getting crushed by a junior 85 champion yeah samusha looks like you know he joined but i don't see him i don't know what what needs to be done with him um he might need to click join with video he was on earlier i i maybe looks like maybe he has audio problems or video because
SPEAKER_02: has his place there i see whatever you know just if he joins you know we uh we continue so how is the preparation how is how is your shape good um i'm still like i'm i'm getting down i'm at that 100 kilo mark right now right around there right now 100 kilos in the morning so like what was your weight when you uh pull uh ram bat
SPEAKER_01: Uh, I was probably like one Oh two, one Oh three. So I'm just dropping it slowly. Like just get the fat off. I had too much. I had too much fat and water for that match.
SPEAKER_01: because ron's so big you know i figured i had to be as big as i could be just eating whatever and being fat it's summer time though it's coming into the summer time it's time to get back down to like beach yes yes yes cardio time now right yeah yeah yeah clean eating for me no no carbs no yeah yeah and we will be more active you know i like the winter time most most of the time we are inside yeah yeah yeah i think that i think that those those quarantine days kind of
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, made people gaining some extra weight as well. But yeah. Yeah. Cause I mean, you, you lose your, you lost your routine. Like I still got to the gym and everything. I made sure I did all that, but like my general activity was lower because I wasn't out as much. So, and then, and then when you're at home, it's so much easier to just go to the refrigerator. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: and and your your normal weight is about what 95 kilo like about 90 about 95 i feel my best at like 92 like if i cut to like 92 or 90 that's where i feel like that's my best competitive shape and i've toyed with that with with these matches but i don't think when i go up to that like 102 103 range i don't think that my strength gets
SPEAKER_01: um comparatively better for that class i feel like if i can cut down to 90 kilos and then weigh like 93 on the day of competition that's where i feel like the sweet spot yeah so so you you are saying that basically if you would pull against the best of the world you would prepare 90 kilo exactly and they they just moved me on the rankings because i haven't been active at 90 kilos
SPEAKER_01: During quarantine, they moved me to the 100 kilo ranking, but that's just because there was no reason to be there. So, like, with the Arnold Classic being watered down and not having a real big nationals here anymore, we don't have like our old nationals where it's a real big deal and everybody cuts weight for it. So, there just hasn't been a reason and all the matches that I've been offered have been at a higher weight. So, for the past two years, I've been just floating around that.
SPEAKER_02: you know, 95 100. Is this what people offer you or you wanted to pull those those guys
SPEAKER_01: Well, I mean, I, I don't ever call anybody out. So if a promoter, yeah. If a promoter reaches out to me and offers a match, I either accept or deny based off of what makes sense. And, um, you know, where I'm at, but like with, you know, with, with Ron and John and some of these other guys, I can't turn those matches down. So I figure out, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I understand. Yeah. And John was, you know, John was big at the time too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hello. Where is that? Wait.
SPEAKER_02: I'm waiting for it to be. Oh, he's coming. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people asking about the John and Pablo match. And did you get to see it? Oh, I saw it. I saw it. Yeah. That round one round one looked like the start, you know, was good for Pablo. Hello. Hello, David. How are you? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: the start was good for the paulo but once he stopped you know yeah yeah yeah yeah and then he bring back and then second round was even like full control i would say yeah and then third round he went even inside you know just hey guys you know it doesn't matter if he's 70 years old same crazy curious guy did you realize that he also had the left arm like let's try left arm and he realized okay not that one
SPEAKER_02: yeah pablo's left is pretty good and i don't know how much john's training is left yeah yeah yeah yeah john's left arm sometimes you know like in the past 20 years ago i have seen him beat in some serious guys you know like like marcio yeah i think even has win over travis maybe lefty you know time to time you know he was doing weird things you know just like i think that he has the genetic potential but
SPEAKER_02: He didn't really invest as much. Yeah. Anyway, so how are you, David? You feeling good? I think he has bad connection as well. So we continue while he is with us. Anyway, so. I think there is poor internet connection maybe.
SPEAKER_02: Um, wait, I have a call. Okay. Okay. Okay. Just reaching while we're chatting with, uh, Paul, uh, Paul, um, do you know your opponent? Did you have any chance to, uh, a little bit search study?
SPEAKER_01: I, yeah, I mean, I, I, um, all of my, all of my, uh, Intel has come in post, um, has come post the announcement. So I've done, I've done all my internet research and I have, uh, there's several Georgian arm wrestlers who live in the New York Baltimore area. So I've gotten to talk and work with them. Um, Goga Goga Ubi lava, um, is one of my training partners in Maryland.
SPEAKER_02: Just one second, Paul. Excuse me, can you just a little bit turn the sound off or something? Yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry. Yes, I can. Yeah, yeah, because, yeah. OK.
SPEAKER_01: what you are saying there are some guys that in new york from georgia yeah yeah yeah zaza um um and then one of my one of my regular training partners goga uh is from the same town as david now goga's older he's my age they are probably speaking hi lo him right
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Normally, Goga tells me, oh, you're going to be good. You feel so strong. He told me it's going to be a good match. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're not giving me any good information. Yeah, they are patriotic guys. You know, they wouldn't. Yeah, no matter where they are, they are still supporting their fellow Georgian arm masters.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Goga and I have become pretty good friends. You know, he comes to all our tournaments and I get down there to Maryland. He's one of my favorite people to train with because of the versatility. And then the European style of training is so much different than what we do here.
SPEAKER_01: Like the setup, the go-go, like the way they format it. And then some of the stuff that they'll do two-handed to simulate is really good for me. Like Oga has like a really good approach to work in those spots where I need to be sticky at or need to be offensive.
SPEAKER_01: And he'll use two hands and we'll work around the table, do static holds. I just like it because it's different from what we normally do here. In the United States, it seems like we just get a whole bunch of guys together and they drink some beers and then they just try and beat each other, which I think has been detrimental to my first couple years. It winds up where you just get hurt and you don't get much better. So I like...
SPEAKER_02: the transition to that more of a training, a training session rather than just arm wrestling people trying to beat him at practice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I agree. So what, what, uh, what do you expect from this match? Do you, do you, you said that, you know, you're open and you search from internet, like, uh, what, what,
SPEAKER_01: did impress you the most about him? Just technical hook pulling, which I think that I have a long way to grow when it comes to being more technical inside. I think I rely on certain things that I'm good at and I'm not always in that clean shoulder driven position. David seems to be incredible, incredibly like structurally sound.
SPEAKER_01: everything's clean shoulders forward elbows tucked his adjustments are really good he's super patient it seems like he can initiate a hook about just against just about anybody so what i expect is it's going to wind up going inside because i don't know if i have the ability to prevent that nor nor do i really want to so you are mostly like what what's impressive with you the the horsepower you have but as you said that you know with a little bit more
SPEAKER_02: connected you know just with like the shoulder hand you know i think that you can be even more dangerous than how you are right now you are i mean undoubtedly you know very very strong um yeah
SPEAKER_01: I need, I need to clean some, I know there's certain holes in my game. Like I need, I need a little bit more center table control and patience. Personally, I tend to be impatient when I feel comfortable, probably too offensive and less patient. So those are some of the things I've been working on. Longer strategic inside pulls. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Instead of the explosiveness, you want to just
SPEAKER_02: maintain you know your angles long time yeah the guys are here you know fighting fighting against uh leon and uh devon uh thing you know guys here i would ask you to show a little bit respect you know the guests here but i would uh i'm doing this just to uh promote the matches from uh east versus west
SPEAKER_02: um you can always find a place to you know discuss about the the things you know about devon and levan you know the time will come we will all be discussing about this anyway so okay so david is coming yeah maybe we need three or four minutes um he's driving a car and i'm waiting for him okay okay anyway so um
SPEAKER_02: you know that he he won uh Zloty tour and he took probably what third there in the overalls was that not was that 2019 2018 I think 18 2019 WAF Atlas didn't compete yeah yeah it was I think yeah 2018 yeah yeah and
SPEAKER_02: he also gave very hard time to uh sundries did you watch that match yes i did i did yeah yeah you are a professional you know when that person is a professional he it's he is professional about everything he is doing yeah that's the idea you are you are that type of person you you some people are like okay i'm good i don't need to study you know
SPEAKER_02: One week I look at the big guy, but I'm sure you're analyzing him, right? No, if I'm the 10 to 1 favorite, I'm still looking at every video I can get. Yeah, yeah. I think it just shows that, you know, how much you love and respect what you are doing. This is what I'm thinking. No, I don't want to, I don't take anything for granted for sure. Yeah, yeah. No. Hey, David, show us some biceps.
SPEAKER_02: Oh no, it froze. David, show us some biceps. Biceps, biceps, show. I think it doesn't work. You hear us? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Somebody's getting bigger. But the forearm is still bigger than his. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he is not. Can you ask him what is his weight right now?
SPEAKER_03: he says that he's in good shape and he's ready for everything uh no what what is his weight his body weight sorry there is poor intern uh body weight so it's on the radio
SPEAKER_03: How old is he? 90. Does he know much about his opponent Pauline? Did he study? He has some information about his opponent. He was watching some kind of videos and he knows that he is a strong opponent.
SPEAKER_02: Especially when he has fighting with Rombatti. Rombatti, he means this man. And Rombatti and Zurab had very good competition, very close. And now Paul was better than Rombatti. Did this intimidate him?
SPEAKER_03: He says that he's obviously strong opponent, strong fighter, and he respects him.
SPEAKER_03: and um he thinks that zura is also a strong opponent so he thinks that he's very strong opponent do you hear me sorry we got you yeah yeah yeah how does how does uh how does maybe sorry can you can you can you ask david how he compares in a hook with zarab
SPEAKER_03: sorry there is internet poor internal connection and it's difficult to understand everything okay there is interruption okay okay okay can you repeat this question sorry uh yeah i just this was wondering how david compares with his his training partner zurab in a hook i don't know maybe they are
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that
SPEAKER_03: fighting will be tension that it will be more interesting for everyone no no this is this is not what he's asking he is asking that you know how samusha is compared to zurab did they train recently he says they have a equal
SPEAKER_03: He says that they did not have fighting for the last period and he does not have any answer about this one. But he thinks that they have equal chance. That's what I expected. It compares Zohra.
SPEAKER_02: yeah because because before the uh pandemic uh zurab was competing 85 kilo and david was competing 80 kilo so their weights were similar but what i see lately from the videos that uh zurab is big zurab is probably bigger than bigger and stronger than when he pulled
SPEAKER_02: yeah he looks like it he looks like it i've been watching a lot of his stuff too yeah yeah yeah his shoulders look like like head head size you know big you know everything yeah yeah and and uh like can you ask him you know he's bigger than his previous times because he was competing 75 kilo and 80 kilo uh before the
SPEAKER_02: before the pandemic. So now he's 90 kilo, but is he well trained? Like did he train enough? Is he in his best shape ever right now? How does he feel?
SPEAKER_03: He says that after training, he only gained seven kilo. Not very much. Now, he's 90, but yeah, for the pandemic, he was 80 kilo. No, no, what I'm just saying is his form right now, it's best. Yes, yes, yes. He is at his best shape right now?
SPEAKER_02: yes he thinks he's in best shape right now oh okay okay okay okay do you do you do you expect uh paul do you expect a hook match or you may surprise us i i don't know if i can prevent a hook match i don't think i don't know if i can keep him from going where he wants to go yeah because i think that when you pull both john and run first rounds you try an outside move
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, depending on how things go or what I feel. Yeah, I don't I mean, I want to go inside, too. You want to go inside? Yeah, I mean, OK, you know, you know what? Let's make you guys totally supernatant. Yeah, for round one, I would be OK with that. For round one, you want to try that? I would be OK with that. But and then round two, if it doesn't go well.
SPEAKER_02: no no you are you are saying that you are saying that round one you are okay but the second round is up to the result of first round okay david can you ask david you know paul paul is ready to start in the hook round one already uh david ready or
SPEAKER_01: uh david is interested in uh what does this opponent think about david oh i so i think he is the best in the world at his weight um i think georgian arm wrestling is possibly the best in the world as far as which cut you know country by country possibly the best in the world so i'm just thankful to get the opportunity to test myself uh against someone of his caliber
SPEAKER_03: Nothing but respect. Thanks. Yeah. But did you understand us, David?
SPEAKER_03: are you ready to start in the hook start like like hook position round one he says that he um he is prepared very well and he is ready for everything and he think that yes
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but he's saying he's going to put me there anyway. So if I can't stop it, I can't stop it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Looks like we have an agreement. Should we do that? I will ask the people on the chat. Would you mind if they start, you know, round one in a hook, deep hook? Yes, yes. Paul is a classic for sure. We can even we can even up to any and, you know, we can start in a strap and a hook.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's better for you, right? I don't know. I don't know if it is or isn't. Inside, it doesn't make a difference. It's sometimes getting inside. I like the strap. Oh, yeah. If I have to force it. I don't think that he's going to go outside. I don't remember him going outside. Yeah. So I was talking to Doug Ehrlich, American arm wrestler who competed against David in Zlaty Tur. I want to say 16. And he did say that David... Who is that? Doug Ehrlich.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah. He said that he flash pinned him in a top roll left arm. So I don't know. Left arm, maybe different versatility. His left arm compared to right arm is like nothing near, you know, just. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So. I'm also checking the chat, you know, like what they say.
SPEAKER_02: Anyways, so, so we guys are making you starting to show in the we decided during the press conference. Okay. Yeah, talk more about it. And, David, how do you honestly, no need to play the nice, nice guy, you know, I will ask the same thing to Paul as well. Honestly,
SPEAKER_03: How much chance do you give yourself in percentage? Do you believe you will win or do you think you will be close? He says 50-50.
SPEAKER_03: He thinks 50-50 because of the weight category, because he thinks that his opponent is maybe 100 kilo.
SPEAKER_02: And he's 90 kilo because of this. Honestly, he believes in himself, but now he thinks that his chance is 50-50. Oh, 50-50. So he basically says that if they were in the same weight, he would give himself more chance. But now some weight difference, so the chances are close. So if that is the case, then I did a good job.
SPEAKER_01: But Paul also thinks that he's not feeling much weaker when he's like 92, 93 kilos, right, Paul? Yeah, I think that's my sweet spot. I think obviously when you gain weight, you get a little bit stronger, but I don't know if it's the comparative effect, like going up the higher weight classes where guys are stronger. I don't know if I gain enough to make it make sense to be any higher than 95. And
SPEAKER_02: how about you are you gonna give us your honest answer are you gonna be like you know you know just nice well i mean honestly honestly um if you look at all the polls um everybody has me as an underdog and and it was it was it was maybe after rambet match now if we do a poll maybe the things change because i also talk with john you know he talks very highly about you as well and you know you you
SPEAKER_02: caused some problems to his forearm and his wrist
SPEAKER_01: know that some minor injuries yeah i mean i i see myself as the underdog um mainly because i prefer to be the underdog and i think it helps for training and mentality um i i think i think that there's a lot of variables um that are gonna be like you know the travel how is my preparation like you know there's a lot of things that are on me to do the right way to give myself a competitive chance
SPEAKER_01: But I wouldn't give myself anything better than a 50-50 just because of the unknown, you know, and the fact that David is much more technical than me and much more polished. And I have to give him a slight edge for sure because of that polish, like technicality. How do you see your endurance, Paul? I think my endurance is fine. No, no, I mean, you're talking about the endurance of...
SPEAKER_01: doing many starts or endurance within the match? So I'm referring to many starts. I think my in-match endurance is not as good as my repetitive endurance. I can practice and compete. I recover quickly between matches. But I think that I could use, and mainly it's because of my lack of patience at this point in my career. I think that I hurt my own endurance by being inefficient.
SPEAKER_02: And Ari, did you do any different kind of preparation just in case you are stopped by him? Absolutely. Because this guy, once he stops someone, he can pull long matches. Same like Bojidar. There is another guy from Turkey, Hamza Zipan. These guys can pull like minutes, minutes, minutes long matches. So this is why, like, are you making your plans for like being a quick win
SPEAKER_02: Or do you also keep in your mind that, like, do you also keep it in your mind that, you know, like there is a possibility that he stopped you and it can be a game of endurance? Yeah, main focus has been center table.
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah. Okay. Durational durational sessions. So do you see some improvements? Yes. Yes. And a lot of it has to do with the confidence, shoulder committed, shoulder commitment, confidence, elbow integrity. So those are the things that I've been working on for like, so it's not just like if I'm working in an inside position, shoulder commitment, it's for duration. It's for 30 to 50 seconds, you know, and controlled training.
SPEAKER_01: rather than just going to practice and just banging. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's also practice too. It's the real one. Right. That is how practice should be, you know, that, you know. Yes, it did. It worked very well. That's the approach I took for Ron was specific spots that I needed to work on and training them like in sets and reps and durations. And I felt like I felt better that day. So I've kind of stuck to that format.
SPEAKER_02: I kind of think that it will be one of the best matches of the event. Like people are just focusing on so much on the paveways and those like
SPEAKER_02: known famous names but last time drop versus run was not the highlight of the event but after the event oh yeah if you just say that which match do you remember the most i would just say so i kind of feel that you versus david will be the same thing you know
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, everybody wants to win. But if we could put that type of show on and I lost, I think I would still be able to sleep at night. So I'd probably still be okay with it. That kind of case. Like, trust me, whenever I remember Ron versus Rob, I don't really remember or it comes to my mind that Rob was the victorious. I remember what I remember that two warriors that they gave everything, they left everything at the table.
SPEAKER_02: that is all i remember and i see two winners there yeah no disrespect to but to me both were winners you know so whenever you have a match you write your name on the history you know like with the golden letters so nobody really cares it's like same ferret versus john the long hook match remember that yeah oh my goodness yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so we are we are you know i'm sure you're translating him but
SPEAKER_02: we expect a long match with him, you know, with Pauline and him. I think we'll be remembered, in my opinion, same as the Zurab versus Ranbet match. Yeah. I said that to translate, but probably she didn't. Yeah. Anyway, so we have some other matches, so I will ask for predictions. Yeah, I will start from
SPEAKER_02: Samusha, can you ask Samusha to leave his patriotic feelings aside and just tell us his realistic opinions? Because there are a lot of Georgian pullers in this cart. I will ask him questions. Can you translate what I say, please? Okay, can you repeat again? Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I am saying that I will ask Samusha now his predictions about the other supermatches, but I want him to answer. I will ask him. There are many Georgians
SPEAKER_03: that will have super matches, so I want him to not to answer with his feelings, but with his like realistic opinion. He think this Georgian are prepared well. yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's not what I was saying, but anyway, so I will ask him.
SPEAKER_03: One by one. What does he think about Revas Lutidze versus Michael Todd? Revas Lutidze. Michael Todd. He thinks Revas Lutidze is in best shape and he definitely wins this race. Revas will win? He says that Revas will win? Revas Lutidze. Revas Lutidze, you mean this one, yeah? Okay, Revas will beat Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah okay i understand and another one what sorry there's a poor connection it's yeah it's difficult
SPEAKER_02: There is poor internet connection. It's interruption, and it's difficult to understand what you say. Sorry. OK. Yeah, no problem. Thank you. I appreciate your help. I was going to also ask, what does he think about Zurab versus John? Zurab versus John? I'm asking his percentage, how much percentage he gives. Ah, how much percentage. How much percentage, yes. And then you can . Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah. He means that Zeki is a legend, and it's difficult to answer. But in his history, Zura is in the best shape. And in this competition, I think the same 50-50.
SPEAKER_02: For Zurab and John Bersink, he gives 50%. Yes, yes. 50-50%. Okay. Okay. And what does he think about Gennady Kvikminya versus Dave Chaffee? You think the same, 50-50.
SPEAKER_02: you know i i have a feeling that whenever georgians are under those okay he's yeah he no he he tried to support georgian but honestly he thinks 50 50 again okay okay okay okay okay and and okay who do we iraqli zirakashvili tatachins
SPEAKER_03: He means that Zira Khashoggi has more chance to win, not 50-50. Maybe he appreciates 70%, I don't know. Okay. And what does he think about Marcio Barbosa? What does he say? Marcio Barbosa, Zira Khashoggi. With Ongar Bayev. He thinks more Oregon Bayev. Ongar Bayev, yeah, he's going to win. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And what does he think about Matt? It sounds like he believes that there is no Western guy will win in this card. What does he think about Prudnik versus Matt Mask? He thinks that Prudnik will have more chance to win this competition. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: uh if he wants to give some details to just like analyze he can also share this other okay about other matches too the previous ones too okay uh she told me that she um have um some information about this one and she
SPEAKER_03: it's not interesting in details now okay he says that he's looking forward to to start this competition and he's waiting this one
SPEAKER_03: And what does it mean? Since 2019, he has never been in any competition, and that is why he's looking forward to this one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's especially motivated now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is, in fact, my intention to set many
SPEAKER_02: georgian athletes in this competition because they are not allowed to compete european and wars so these are elite athletes and it is very hard to reach to elite level and i just didn't want these guys to uh maybe quit arm wrestling or lose motivation before you know just that that that is the main reason that
SPEAKER_03: I focus on the fellow Georgian armistice, you know. Okay, Georgian, I appreciate this one. Yeah, yeah. Did he understand what I said or? Yeah, your attention is to give more motivates to Georgian armistice. No, no, no, but I wasn't telling to you, but I was telling you to translate to him, you know. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_03: said that he he's glad to hear that and he appreciates this one because he has a possibility opportunity to join in this competition and he respects this one and thanks for everything yeah i also i also appreciate and thank him for being part of it um so and what are you thinking about krasimir versus
SPEAKER_03: He tries to avoid such question and escape from this question and he always says 50-50. He will say 50-50 again? Yes, he has to say. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I think we, and the other one, Efe versus Zurab, left arm. Does he know Efe? He thinks definitely 100% that Zurab is much stronger. Zurab will win, huh? Okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Zura is in the best form in his history. With John, he says 50-50 because he's a legend athlete. That is why he tries to say this one 50-50. But Zura, he means that he's definitely, he will be definitely a winner.
SPEAKER_02: because he trained very hard and he's prepared. Paul, let's talk with you. I think we are going to have more detailed conversation right now. It sounds like David thinks that there will be no Western puller that is favored against all those matches against the Eastern ones.
SPEAKER_02: And I would like to ask your opinion for each match. Like if you start, John Brzezinski versus Rob. I talked with, you know, I told people also, I did a interview with Travis Badgen. It was more than two hours. It was the best ever interview. And I forgot to record. Yeah, seriously. Oh, and you didn't record it.
SPEAKER_02: and then i forgot i was like why this video doesn't come yet i wait wait wait i was like oh i forgot to record it and if you do it again there's no way it'll be as good as the first time no way ourselves you know but i am travels will always be creative don't worry about it
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so he thinks that John is just going to beat Zurab very badly because he says that he will not allow him to use his power.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I see it similarly, especially after watching the Pablo match and what John's done recently. I think early on when he was making his comeback, I don't know how I think, you know, his pronation was fully intact, but it looked like a little bit of wrist flexion wasn't there. Yeah, a little bit of finger containment. And I think he's really got back to that, which I think stylistically makes him the favorite. I will be interested to see if John tests the inside early.
SPEAKER_01: know because i think that would be a deciding factor but i see john at least in round one staying outside full pronator lock just hand control i i i have john is the favorite in that one but i do see zurab looks like he's in the absolute best shape of his life and i hear david saying that he is so it'll be interesting for sure but i have john as the favorite yeah um
SPEAKER_02: You know, over there, you guys have John, but people over here, like it is just like a lifetime opportunity.
SPEAKER_01: Like it's just like not many people will have this opportunity. No, I know. Yeah. And I got to believe that that in itself is possibly the biggest motivating factor there is, especially for Zura coming in. Like, I mean, we know we're going to see the best version of it. So you can you can translate to David if these things, you know, so maybe he would be interested to hear.
SPEAKER_02: Like, while we're talking, if you want, because now he doesn't understand. Are you there? Hello? Yeah. Like, while we're talking, can you translate to David, you know, so he can have some ideas what we are talking about, please. Anyways. Yeah. So, uh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think that if John tries hook or something, he shouldn't try it before round three. Round three. I agree. Yeah, that guy has really strong bicep and, you know, some side pressure. Side pressure looks incredible. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Did you, do you realize that in which positions he was able to hold Ron sometimes, you know, Ron was all over on him. He was still holding on his bicep. Ron was on top of him, basically the whole match. He was pulling up almost the whole match in some really weird spots. And it looked like his elbow integrity was, was really, really solid. And he got, and he got like the heart of a champion, like not giving up. Like he gutted that went out. A lot of guys would have quit.
SPEAKER_02: So you are saying that basically John is going to win. I think John's the favorite. I think he's the favorite to win. And what do you think about Barbosa versus Ongarbaya?
SPEAKER_01: see this is one and like marcio is a good friend and yeah i and marcio is training like like i've known marcio and i've talked to him you know coming into certain matches and i i date it back to like the todd hutchings match um the time of year it was and i talked to him prior to the match and he was like i'm i'm working i'm working you know 12 hours a day training's hard
SPEAKER_01: and he wound up not doing well in that match now talking to to marcio now i know he's in top form like he's confident in his training yeah
SPEAKER_01: coming here to prove himself again yes yep and i think we are getting the best version of marcio right now his energy seems really good um even with that said though um i still see this one very close possibly favoring agrabahev but i know there wasn't there didn't anger buyer ever had like an injury and some time off i think i think he had shoulder surgery yeah and then he had he had one match
SPEAKER_02: about two months ago at kazakhstan nationals he lost against another georgian valerie barano but very strong guy right and but they pull again only yesterday in the asian championships and i have the video mazgan shamiev another world champion sent me
SPEAKER_02: and uh on that way i won okay was it easy yeah easily okay no not so easy not so easy the other guy went to hook and the on guard where like half hook semi hook but with the pronated control so he was going and then he finally pinned him he was like maybe 15 seconds like not that easy but he didn't have a super control but let's see you know but only way of just pulling 100 kilo
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you know what? In light of that... Yeah, in light of that, I don't know, man. I think, like, if we were talking about Anger Baia from Top 8 a couple years back and Marcio in his best form, I would probably favor Anger Baia. But I guess with all these different factors at play, I think it's closer than I would have originally picked it. I kind of think that from my side, I'm an organizer. I shouldn't have opinions about that. But from outside look, Marcio looks favorite.
SPEAKER_01: Right. Also, I look this how it looks, you know, I'll be rooting for him. I'll be in his corner. I'm sure about it. Yeah, it should be a good one, though. It should be a good one. Yeah, I agree. It should be close. I don't I don't see it. I see it being close regardless of who wins. And what do you think about? Dave Chaffee is generally. So I think stylistically,
SPEAKER_01: I think stylistically the match favors Dave. Just where Dave's at and how he looked in his last match. Now, Gennady's coming off of great showings as well, you know, over Michael and everything. I just, I think Dave's flat-wristed side pressure. I have Dave as a slight favorite. But this is one where I'm basing that off of Dave's current form.
SPEAKER_01: and where he's at mentally. He looks incredible. It's not necessarily off of like who's stronger, who's a better puller, but I think Dave's mind state is really good right now. And that's just from what I know, being in Pennsylvania with him and talking to his training partners and him. So I think he has, I think I would put him as the favorite. Yeah, from outside look, yeah. But you know, the truth is, before Michael and Gennady pulled,
SPEAKER_01: i was thinking that michael was favorite as well right i did too i did too i and you know i think in hindsight i see i see kind of how it went um and i think michael i think michael's better at a slightly lighter weight so but i was really really impressed with ganadi i mean he patient and climbing and just he looked he pulled perfect and he looked like a tank with that match about michael we didn't have
SPEAKER_02: much info by a super match or something previous. All we knew that he was manning against Devon. After that, we didn't see him. We were thinking that he was going to win because of what he was saying about his form and this. But about Dave, it's kind of a little bit different. We just saw him in Dubai. Yeah. And he looked very dangerous. And then. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: his current pictures and everything yeah you see that picture of his arm after training yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like a dinosaur leg or something yeah personally i wouldn't want to be at the other side of the table but you know let's see let's see how it will but i can still see sure don't misunderstand me uh they may win that match what's that um they may win that match they may even dominate that match but
SPEAKER_02: generally i see gennady a better arm i'm not saying stronger no i agree but i agree like yeah he's well-rounded he can like one if he balanced the match somehow stops the match yes i mean he has more chance to win but he needs to stop dave yeah dave has the hard part hardest part and looks very hard looks very hard to stop dave
SPEAKER_01: Dave has the curse of being the strongest guy, you know? And I think he's, you know, he's all that side pressure, all that wrist flexion and control that he's, I think possibly it has hampered his ability to be versatile because he doesn't have to be. But I, you know, his pronator looks really good too right now. Just watching him train and his pronation looks like.
SPEAKER_03: like yeah like whole hand sorry i would like to say something okay yeah yes hello you want to say something yeah there is there is poor connection and we cannot understand anything and if you don't mind we'll leave this chat okay okay okay yeah yeah yeah okay thank you thank you very much for joining welcome bye yeah um
SPEAKER_01: uh yeah and so other than that now we have uh uh i don't know i i think it's i i think this one goes possibly goes 3-0 either way
SPEAKER_01: Like, like if Iraq, we can, you know, watching Todd, um, um, um, while I go on a blank, um, get top rolled. Um, when, when he pulled, um, like, why am I drawing a blank? The last, the last time Todd Zola with watching, watching him get top rolled that style of top role and Iraq Lee having similar characteristics. Um,
SPEAKER_01: I think that it could be it could be 30 outside or actually or it'll be 30 inside Todd or if Todd's just able to kind of anchor, you know, I thought Todd was really impressive when Chance Top rolled him. So it looks like that, you know, open wrist side pressure is looking serious.
SPEAKER_01: but i i mean i i i i can't like if somebody said like hey you have to make a wager on this one i would i would probably bet on todd but i wouldn't be real super confident yeah so you you wouldn't put a lot of money you wouldn't risk a lot no i'm 10 and i'm not putting the mortgage on it yeah yeah uh chuck thank you very much my friends i thank you for your support
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so my opinion about that, it will not be like, you know, Irakli versus Tad will not be like Zolev versus Tad because once Zolev has more dominating hands outside of the strap. Right. Yeah. So somehow he doesn't allow people to go to strap. He did the same thing to Sasho. He did the same thing to Taino.
SPEAKER_02: Many other people, he doesn't let them sleep and then he pins them. Good hand control. Right. Iraki doesn't have that outside of the strap. And that match is going to go strap. If Todd really wants to sleep, the match is going to go to strap. So in my opinion, that day, if Zolev and Todd Hutchings would go to strap,
SPEAKER_02: uh Todd would have won that yeah I agree I agree so the things will be different the match will go to strap yeah but inside of the strap I kind of believe that uh Iraqis uh back pressure and top role in Ability is probably uh stronger than Zola's the outside and Zola is like 90 kilo guy now Iraq Iraqis
SPEAKER_02: I asked him, he said 190 something. Mimi is about 63. No, maybe two and a half, yeah, three, two, yeah, 63. And so what I'm just saying is it is his comfortable weight and he's heavier. Of course, here Todd will be heavier too because there was 97 kilo weight limit when he pulls Zola. So this match is going to go to strap. What I see, Irakli is going to top roll.
SPEAKER_02: thought but then then the thing starts that the question starts will he be able to pin and if yes can he do that three times that that is like everything on my mind is this you know about that much yeah right it's and and that's that the how how how would you compare iraqli's explosiveness to um solo ev what's that
SPEAKER_02: How would you compare Iraq Lee's explosiveness, like fast Twitch, like, like ability, Zola Zola, um, can go to the pin pad, especially without the strip. He can go to the direct pin pad. It actually usually is a guy that is positioning first, right. And then that position is given some time for such a.
SPEAKER_02: slow puller i should say not so explosive you know whenever you judge talk with you like bruce tam and other guys he's not that that so his 0 to 60 speed is not that quick so if the guy is positioning first instead of directly flashing him he's having opportunity to position himself and then the thing's getting harder there i'm 100 sure it will be a hard match unless one of them
SPEAKER_01: will dominate the other one that we had no idea. I kind of don't see that big possibility. Maybe just say 20% of possibility. One of them dominates the other one. Okay. Well, you're convincing me. I think I need to up my bet on Todd to like 20 bucks now. I think I feel better. I feel better about Todd now. Yeah, I feel better now. I feel better about Todd on this one. Okay, you were betting $10? I was betting $10. I'm ready to double it.
SPEAKER_01: okay okay yeah and the other thing too is Todd's so dang active like Todd is pulling everywhere he is like I think and as long as there's no injuries which I don't think there is this guy is competing like every three weeks so he's super active yes yes and somehow somehow he is healthy
SPEAKER_01: I know he's an anomaly. I don't understand his elbow. I've talked to him so many times about elbow and shoulder and he's like, I don't get any pain. And he tells me to do the JM presses. Like he says, that's his thing, his trick. And I've been doing JM presses for two years and my elbow feels like crap.
SPEAKER_02: it helps it helps for recovery but it doesn't make me like iron or something no i know that's what i mean i'm like it it feels better when i do it but then when i go arm wrestle it still hurts yeah yeah yeah not nothing is like rest yeah you're right and uh how about matt mask versus brudnick
SPEAKER_01: I have Prudnik as the favorite. I love Matt, but I think that that one goes Prudnik. And I think Prudnik's ability to pull outside his hand strength, his ability to post his top knuckle against the low hand. I'll be rooting for Matt, but I think that that's a tough one. Yeah. And how do you see? How do you see that? Like, technically, how do you see that it's happening? I think that Prudnik post top rolls or high hooks.
SPEAKER_01: I think that's the lane. And I mean, the question is if he, you know, if he like, you don't want to try and take Matt inside. And I think he's, he knows that, you know, so I feel like we'll see a lot of high crushing cup and center table. If he goes back pressure versus back pressure against Matt, there is no chance Matt to take. I don't think so. As long as, as long as, as long as prudent, it keeps his knuckle high.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. As long as his knuckle high. If he dumps wrist to Matt at all, then he's in trouble. Yeah, but the guy just goes, as you said, like high top roll like this, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yep. Stylistically, I feel like that's the antonym to to Matt's move. And I just I mean, I would love I hope I hope it's a war and, you know, Matt's going to show up fired up and his set up game. If he if he does great in the setup, that could change things. I just feel like after watching Prudnik's like after pulling and stuff, he he's just I I have a lot of respect for that guy. Yeah, like I like he's like one of my favorites. You know, I think I think after John Bersink,
SPEAKER_02: if you judge like his career he's nowhere near uh like you understand like yeah yeah but but i think that it is because uh he had a serious shoulder injury in 2015 europeans and then he didn't do well and then he went to professional and there he had to pull against the big guys yeah you know so but
SPEAKER_02: know just like it is hard a heavyweight guy or light heavyweight guy or just i should just say like heavyweight guy to like do something against la latin and right yeah levan or something so but around this this weight class 110 something i think i think he can be the best he may be the best right now but we will absolutely yeah we will see but if you judge him
SPEAKER_02: about technical way well around this hand control everything yeah yeah versatility side pressure everything pronation he's just he's uh he's a total package yeah yeah i would just say that john i'm talking about the best of john yeah here and then i would just put put it right below him you know do you think that that's a match we'll ever see at 110 no oh we will see we will see but i'm just
SPEAKER_02: thinking i know i know i kind of think prudnik prudnik will be too much yeah because i would want john to win i would want john yeah me too yeah yeah me too but i just kind of think that you know he he will he will he will be stronger yeah i think yeah but it would be great to see if john at this age beating prudnik wow wow wow yeah wow yeah
SPEAKER_02: I never met with John. No, you can't count them out. Especially if he's really motivated. Yeah. I would want, I want to do like August events. I want to do some like bell title matches. Yeah. Yeah. That would be cool. I Prudnik has to be the favorite, but it would be, it would be fun to see it. Yeah. For August, we have, uh, and Prudnik, but do you think that I should just reconsider about the, uh, August matches? When I said the August matches, there was no may event. Right.
SPEAKER_02: yeah i wasn't gonna do it because the war in ukraine and this and that so then i set the august matches like five for them and then i i decided to do may event yeah so i i said the may event but like if i knew that i was gonna do something in may i wouldn't set the
SPEAKER_02: uh augusta yeah yeah after the results of the may event do you think i should reconsider the matches or i should still go with what i plan like john versus iraqli and brudnick versus todd i would i would keep the competitors the same but maybe reconsider opponents uh okay maybe yeah yeah yeah yeah yes because i promised those guys yes you'll be part of it but yeah
SPEAKER_01: Maybe the, the pairs maybe should be, yeah, I think that's, I think that's only fair. And I think it's only fair to the fans too, because depending on how some of these matches go, you know what I mean? Yeah. Like if Iraq Lee smokes, Todd Hutchings, do we wanna see Todd pull prudent or, you know, what, how does, how do I understand? I understand. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. So maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe I should just sit down while they're in Istanbul. Yeah. And then we talk.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah then you get to when you get to see who they want to i i wouldn't change anything without their uh willing you understand like yeah absolutely yeah yeah but the only guy that would be upset would be iraqi because he is set for jumpersing oh yeah
SPEAKER_02: yeah you know when you are having a match with john brzen yeah yeah you can't you can't take a kid's christmas present away right when he's underneath the christmas tree oh yeah from outside you may look christmas present but whenever you come close yeah and then it may become something else you know talking about john yeah yeah anyway so um what do we have more uh we have uh matt mask versus
SPEAKER_01: Morozov, left arm. I hope Matt can win one of these two matches, but I see Morozov as a favorite here too. I know Matt's left is pretty good and he's gotten some really good wins there, but that's Morozov's dominant arm, right? Yes. Yeah. I got Artem as a favorite. Do you know Tobias? Mm-hmm. Tobias and
SPEAKER_02: morozo will pull right arm okay okay that that's interesting yeah that could be interesting i don't know how to pick that one yeah yeah i think that both of them their left arm is better right yeah those those are the tricky ones to pick when when two people are pulling with their off arm and for for the for the others i want to see jerry i want to see hermes you know just
SPEAKER_02: the only only problem is that the only problem um i'm too emotional guy you know whenever whenever i said an event first i set then i calculate the expenses so i didn't even realize the the global inflation oh my plane tickets i know hotel all those cameras and everything you know now this event is going to cost 20 percent more than the last event
SPEAKER_01: Yep. Is there any way for you to sell commercials? I don't know. I'm terrible about these kind of things. I am too. But we've been talking about this. And Michael Todd, I've talked with Michael and stuff. And pay-per-view is tough. And I know you guys get a lot of people tune in across the world for your events.
SPEAKER_01: we were toying with the idea of using, um, commercials and, and, um, you know, the idea of, of, uh, selling rather than getting sponsors, offering back commercials or advertisement, you know, at a fee, I don't know how that works with pay-per-view, but that could be a, an opportunity to offset a little bit of that overhead. I don't know how it would work though. I will do my best. We are still trying.
SPEAKER_02: I think we need to become more and more popular. Yeah. No. And do you know Arif Ertem, the current WAP champion? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. He lost versus Hermes, who is an incredible top roller. Right. He's going to pull Krasimir. Do you have any opinion about this? So if you would have asked me two weeks ago, I would have probably backed Krazy. But after watching him pull with Corey...
SPEAKER_01: uh i have a little bit of question about his form and that's not to take anything away from corey but i feel like i know krazy said that he's in good form but i don't know that's yeah you know arif is already three zero against uh krasimir from right previous events
SPEAKER_01: and yeah this crossing this time is coming for revenge you know yeah yeah i i just i mean after watching that that event in arizona um i don't know if there's enough time between that event and this event um i have ours as a favorite and that's just based off of the recent the recent data yeah is also good form but not super form because we just finished a month of ramadan
SPEAKER_02: And, you know, from sunrise to sunset, you know, we cannot eat, we cannot drink, you understand? That has to have an effect. Yeah, yeah. About, like, what? About probably about 15 hours. Summertime is getting even longer. But 15 hours, you cannot. So you train, you know, even late, near night, you know? Yeah, it's like you're being forced to do an intermittent fasting diet, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Anyways, but somehow whenever I fast, my power is somehow... Me too, me too. Maybe the body is just getting clean or getting rested or... That's what I do like in this little fat cut that I'm doing. I do intermittent fasting. I don't eat after 8 p.m. and I don't eat until the next day until noon. And then I try to be active during those hours a little bit. I don't actually lift during those times because I don't feel strong in those hours.
SPEAKER_01: I lift afterwards after I have my lunch, then I feel good. And once I get a couple of weeks into it, I feel good. Yeah. So you get probably your organs also get rested because you're not like
SPEAKER_01: pushing so much because when we eat too much constant metabolism you know what i mean yeah yeah that's all i did i mean i just do lower carbs and i do intermittent fasting and i usually don't have to do a lot of cardio if i do a little cardio it's just walking you know so that works really well yeah i also do walking yeah yeah i kind of fast walking i do outside you know i don't even do
SPEAKER_01: You walk inside on the car? I walk depending on my season. So if it's nice out, I'll take a walk outside. If it's not nice, I just put the treadmill on a slight incline and I walk at three miles an hour. So you are not like 100% gym guy? I don't like...
SPEAKER_01: don't like treadmills and i don't like i don't like commercial gyms so i have i have the the gym that i train in which is a little bit like it's it's like like a huge garage yeah that's the best one you yeah you have your privacy it is yes yep yep that's it do you know if they pull run back left arm yeah he's gonna pull up with left arm i zurab's left is dominant right
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Zurab, yeah, he beat Jonathan Breda here. Yeah, I see Zurab as a favorite there. You see, yeah. And we have a friend that you don't know him. His name is Saip. He's going to put Marcio with left arm. Okay. Yeah, strong hand, but let's see how it will be with Marcio Barbosa. He's a top roller, strong hand. Yeah, he's not bad. He's as good as Efe.
SPEAKER_02: yeah marcio's marcio's got a good left too so i i don't don't know don't know enough about his opponent there to to be able to pick but yeah that would be interesting i wish i wish i i wish i had so much money that i could set like this event like every one and a half month instead of every three months but trust me the expense is getting so much that you know i'm i realize that you know uh i'm gonna
SPEAKER_02: become a position i won't be even able to organize at all you know because right um it is really like i can't you know like probably i need to go like eight nine matches or something but whenever i think about eight nine matches
SPEAKER_01: I'm just thinking that, OK, I won't be giving opportunity to this guy and this guy and that guy, you know, and they will be like set me a match. I feel guilty, but I really don't have power to do that. You can't please everyone. And that's the thing that I get. I want to. I know. And it's it's terrible because we talk about this all the time. No matter what you do, you can pour your blood, sweat and tears and your heart into an event.
SPEAKER_02: And if one little thing goes wrong or like the audio is bad, you got so many people that are unsatisfied. So it's like it's such a thankless job. So you can't please everybody. This time is not going to happen. This time we are very careful about that. Right. If you have seen me, just ask those people that, you know, when there was an audio problem, ask anyone that was there, you know, from America, you know, I don't know if they were there.
SPEAKER_02: ask how i was i was just like like nobody would want to be around me yeah i know i know i mean i was just like you know in a mood that i don't want to express here yep yeah we host i tried hard and did everything like how the hell this is happening you know it's like
SPEAKER_02: And then whenever I read those comments and, you know, oh, they said that. And I was like, yeah, it's like, come on, man. Like we're doing our best here and we're trying to do it for you. We're not making any money. We're spending all this time. It's free labor. You know, the guy paid the money. You can say anything to him. So I said something to the people who are responsible, you know.
SPEAKER_01: and then yeah so what to do you know just i i know the feeling we host a we host a couple tournaments here and uh we do an annual one and it's pretty big it's a 500 entry tournament and that that weekend is the most stressful anxiety driven weekend like i'm not looking forward to it at all it's you can't even it's hard to enjoy it in the moment so i feel for you yeah just trust me that you know people like us you know just like we are just like
SPEAKER_02: I can really, it is like some people tries to do like empathy, you know, to put your yourself into the position of the other person. For me, it is like, so natural thing to put myself into the position of another arm master, high level arm master, like, this is all my life, you understand, I know how they are feeling, they trade, they are like, you know, like,
SPEAKER_02: Like I need opportunity. I need, I'm training, you know, they like me, many people write to me and you know, I want the match. And whenever, do you know how I feel? I feel like, like, uh, not literally, but I feel like a father who is responsible. You understand? Right. To do, you know? Yeah. This is how I feel. I don't feel like, you know, oh, how much money should I should make? Maybe I should just put like five matches and then same pay per view since the guys are, we know which matches are taking attention.
SPEAKER_02: But that is not the service. Of course, you may make some money, but that's not my intention because I enjoy it.
SPEAKER_01: I also love to please those guys that are training me. Yeah, yeah. And that's why it's like anybody who tunes into these events or comes to these tournaments really should have that empathy. And I know not everybody has that emotional intelligence to be able to put themselves in other people's shoes. But I mean, promotion is a very, very thankless thing. And some people have found a way to make money off of it. Myself, no.
SPEAKER_01: yeah anything that anything that we've ever made off of a tournament gets funneled right back into the next one so it's like a rolling break even but i'm okay with that because if i was doing it for money um i feel like i wouldn't have the same passion towards it yes it would be a job
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you will be feeling that you're doing something to get something back, you know, exactly. And it's like you said, I want to provide this awesome event that has 15 matches, I could give you five and charge you the same amount of money, but no, I want it to be better than everybody else's.
SPEAKER_01: when it's when it's about money you start finding a way to cut out overhead and when you cut out overhead your product starts sucking so if you want to make money it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna deteriorate your product you know this is the second time that i am borrowing money from everywhere oh no
SPEAKER_02: Don't go to the loan sharks. Don't get yourself in trouble. I have a book, you know, just like a notebook, you know, just writing, you know, like from where I can get this much. Of course, later I need to pay them back, you know, but just like, it's just, you know, a little bit. Yeah, don't get yourself in trouble. Be careful. I am in trouble. I am in trouble. It's okay. It's okay. The worst case, only one time I would lose and I wouldn't organize because, not because I wouldn't want, but whenever you just said that, you know, you want to organize more matches because you want to be better than anyone else.
SPEAKER_02: Anyone else, trust me, I don't have that intention either. Like not, not to be better than anyone else. Well, you wanna put, you wanna put the, you wanna put the better product out. You wanna put the better product. Yes. Yes. But, but that, that, that is not my intention. My intention is to please. Right. The fans. Exactly. And then also to give opportunity to those athletes who are training hard and waiting an opportunity, you know, to show themselves, you know, yeah.
