SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Zurab surprised me with his... Hello, how do I pronounce it? Zurab surprised me with his confidence. I mean, I respect him, and I'm not going to question his thoughts. But he surprised me, you know, I find him, you know, surprisingly overconfident. But, you know,

SPEAKER_00: Huh? Bruce? Oh, okay. Oh, you are from Georgia. Respect to Georgia as well. And yes, pronation is good because he has unique machine for training. It has been always good. I have like six, seven different exercises for pronation. And the machine that you guys see is only one of them.
SPEAKER_00: And those pronation trainings, they don't replace each other's place. So my pronation training is different, mostly coordinated either with finger or the wrist or with the lats or even with the spinators, you know. Yep, it is very comfortable, master pronator, yep.
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so, like, my tornado training is not just to train the tornado, but it is, how to say, it is specific for each technique that I'm going to face. Tornado against a top roller, tornado against a guy that's going side pressure, or hook, even for a shoulder pressure, because you are using your tornado in a different way. So that's why I'm using them in a
SPEAKER_00: different way and so training differently but but nothing replaces the table training as long as your training partner is very good oh like yeah what do i think about gennady versus dave dave looks favorite you know and but but you know okay
SPEAKER_00: This time, please, okay, he's gone again. Dave looks favorite, but Genadi may surprise us. In fact, Genadi surprised me when he beat Michael. Michael was huge. He looked very strong, incredible, but when I asked Genadi, like, if he really believes that he's gonna beat Michael on the,
SPEAKER_00: uh the press conference he said yeah yeah and then i was like okay let's see and then he did it so but of course that is um different different uh different uh thing you know different thing yeah i don't know why rebels can't join but

SPEAKER_00: okay people say that their audio is fine but somebody okay let me try with this one um one second
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, we not hear you. No, no engine. The speaker will be better. No, it's okay. Yeah, we hear you. Okay. Now it sounds better. So can you turn the camera to Ravas so we can see him, please?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, now I hear you well as well. Yeah. So finally. So how are you, Revaz? No, turn the phone sideways. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's good. He's very well. He is, yeah. Thank you for this invitation. How are you guys? I thank you guys for joining and being my guest.
SPEAKER_03: You're always welcome. You're always welcome. Yeah. And the picture that Revaz sent me today was from today? Yes. Today, a few hours later. Yeah. Did they train? Did they train? What did he show? Yeah. He said that, yes. Did they train?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, a little bit everything smashed. Oh, a little bit everything, okay. Anyway, it's anymore. He gets the, uh, use the resting right now. Preparing for. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: and that was told me that he's 144 kilo so yeah looks like he's in good shape right now yes he feels very well he said that he just started resting and
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that how after the few days will be way, way better. Yeah, because he needs to get rest because he trained so heavy. Yes, yes, he just started resting. Yeah, yeah. That's been a bond. Yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And we saw him training with İrakli. İrakli gave him some trouble, but then we saw him with Genadi. Genadi wasn't able to go outside against him. He couldn't top roll him. Okay, let me ask that. Okay. .
SPEAKER_03: uh he said that it was the just training and with uh with iraqli he has the after the heavyweight training that's why uh but um then with kennedy he was a little bit rested that's why he looks like this oh okay so
SPEAKER_03: He trained with İrakli after the weightlifting, they did it. So his endurance is not good. That is why he looked a little bit tired. Yes, he tried it after heavy weights to feel İrakli because he's too strong.
SPEAKER_03: he always try to training on the table after the heavy weights, you know, because only the person to training, it's only the one, nobody's here to... I understand, I understand, yeah. And the question is, we know that he is very, very strong, but his opponent is a type of person that to beat him usually
SPEAKER_03: the strength alone is not enough, there needs to be some technical adjustments in the match. Does he feel that, you know, he can do those things to win? Yes. We know that he is a very talented player. He knows how to use the plastic and how to use the technique.
SPEAKER_03: yes he said that he can be bold but he said the last time he was using the heavy weights and want to feel more stronger uh that's why no no i'm talking i'm talking about not him i'm talking about michael todd
SPEAKER_00: about Michael Todd his opponent is very like unique unique opponent so usually power by itself is not enough to beat him you know once he stops him he needs to do some technical adjustments like what does he think about that his opponent in Istanbul
SPEAKER_03: he said he said that to say this how what he's been what it will be in the future is too too difficult then he he thinks that after after he will not fail he will understand he he will he will
SPEAKER_03: he he don't know how it will be goes you know okay the table uh on the table he will okay okay so i understand i was just curious if if he did any specific training for his opponent or just he did just his regular training
SPEAKER_03: no he he used the regular practice he did not use anything something special the workouts or nothing he just prepared the how it's used every time i understand but but that that's the thing that you know his his opponent is just a regular opponent or is a little bit a little bit uh no no no just regular
SPEAKER_03: regular you know you mean his opponent is a regular opponent yeah he thinks that the thought will be the special yes he he said that the thought is the stronger arm wrestler he likes him
SPEAKER_03: and think that he's the great arm wrestler he he he did not practice a few years and why he don't knows what it will be
SPEAKER_00: okay okay he didn't do his best like every time i understand and and what is his shape right now is he 100 okay he appreciate every opponent he said i appreciate every opponent and michael is one of them that's it yeah um is is how is his shape right now is he 100 percent
SPEAKER_03: What do you think about the fact that your 10% action is very effective? How do you think about it? How do you think about it? In my opinion, there is nothing that can be done in this way for a year or two.
SPEAKER_03: he said that right now he has the he's the 40 percent only because they around the four years they did not training
SPEAKER_03: Was his shape insane? How many percent? His shape is around 40% his best. Forty percent? Forty percent, yes. But he is about to go harder training. But if he will be training like this around six, eight months, a year,
SPEAKER_00: he could be more and more. Oh, okay. Does he regret that, you know, he accepted the match? Because I didn't know that he wasn't training at all. And does he regret that he accepted the match if he is only 40%? Yes. I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: He said that right now it's in better shape than the first time he started training.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, but I didn't understand. When he started training, he was 40%? Or right now he's 40%? No, no. He thinks that right now he has 40%. And he's going to go harder, training, training, non-stop. And he thinks that maybe a year he will be in the best shape. I understand. But if he's only 40%, how in the training he was beating Genadi?
SPEAKER_03: uh he's too strong brother he's too strong brother he's too strong he's 100 is too much believe me he's he's the stronger guy that i met every
SPEAKER_03: so his his his 40 percent is better than gennady's best shape okay uh i don't know i cannot say like this but i don't know how much no no you don't need to say anything you you just translate please you say that you know he's 40 percent better than best of gennady that's interesting
SPEAKER_03: well he's just smiling he he he cannot know what to what to say about this i told you his 100 percent is too much his 40 percent is enough for everyone believe me okay
SPEAKER_00: okay so okay okay anyway so uh i want to ask him about his opinions about the the the other matches uh like what does he think about gennady versus uh dave chaffee is his opinion
SPEAKER_03: He wants to became the winner, Genadi. He don't play something for future, you know, but he, they are friends and he wants to, if Genadi will beat. But he, but he think that
SPEAKER_03: it will be very hard because the chef is strong too but he cannot say anything for future he don't like i i understand i understand but but he but his his 40 percent will be better than dave his opponent yeah
SPEAKER_03: He said that, let's see how this much will be and then after he will say, but he wants to course a little bit and try with
SPEAKER_03: chef but he wants to try with chef in the future he will understand after this much if it will be all there everything very well maybe he will try why not
SPEAKER_03: yeah so if i if i shortly ask you know like does he believe that he has chance to win against michael
SPEAKER_03: He think that he don't want to say anything, what will be the future, but he think that Mike, it will be very hard for Mike. I understand. I understand. And the guys are here on the case saying that.
SPEAKER_00: Why I choose nobody? This guy is a European champion and gave very hard time to Levan in the past. And he has incredible potential. I just didn't know about his shape. But even in this shape, he didn't look bad, you know. I saw him training with Genadi. He was better than Genadi. And then I saw him with İrakli. But he said that he trained very heavy and then trained with İrakli. He still was good. He was still good.
SPEAKER_00: So I don't think that, you know, the guy is nobody, as you guys are thinking, not all of you, but some of you right that way. Anyway, so and what does he know, Todd Hutchings? Yeah. Yeah. And what does he think about Iraq versus him?
SPEAKER_03: He said that it will be very interesting.
SPEAKER_03: He think that both is very close together. And of course he wants to win the Georgian. And he said that it will be very interesting. But he want to, if the winner will be Georgian. I understand. But did he say anything technically? How the match will go?
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that İrakli will open his wrist. Okay, İrakli will open his wrist? Yeah. He will push with the open wrist. That would be interesting. And then? I don't know. He cannot say nothing.
SPEAKER_03: and iraqli to win but to say in future close level who iraqli no exactly and todd he says like 50 50.
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that yes, it's the 50-50, but İrakli is way younger, faster, and he thinks that İrakli has more chance. I understand, yeah. And Zurab and John Bersink? Oh, I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, about his match he said that it's so hard to say something. Zurab is very strong.
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that Zurab is too strong and his shape is better than Ron Beth. He thinks that Zurab is more stronger and he is strong.
SPEAKER_03: and he said that zank is the king what's that he said that zank is the king strong he says things yeah john is the king but zurab is strong i understand yeah and and what does he think about uh
SPEAKER_03: uh does he know pauline who paul lean the samusha's opponent samusha his opponent he never hear about him he he don't know he says but samushia is
SPEAKER_00: too strong guy he said he likes he likes samushia and he's very technically and strong but he never hear about his opponent yeah yeah yeah the guys on the chat they are saying that uh is making fun with me he's not making fun with me we respect each other a lot to not to do such things guys um that's your imagination anyways um
SPEAKER_00: that Pauline just beat Rambetz only a few weeks ago, like three weeks ago. He did not sell this video anymore. And then Pauline also gave some very hard match to John Brzenk, but John Brzenk won, but not so easily.
SPEAKER_04: Okay guys. Is it my internet or?
SPEAKER_00: their internets. There's a problem. They were out. Enter again.
SPEAKER_00: okay i think i'm alone now you guys are funny wi-fi 40 40 signal
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but since yesterday, I'm hearing very interesting things, you know, about the percentages that Georgians are telling me, the one that, you know, when Zorabse is 50% stronger than last time, it was, yep. And now, you hear me? Yeah? Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_00: yes yes about connection yeah yeah he was he was he was uh uh can you turn the camera sideways yeah yeah thank you uh what what was he saying did you tell him about that john bersing had a hard time with him in the hook with the pauline and he was saying something and the connection was bad okay um he did not saw this video yet okay so if if each
SPEAKER_03: If this guy is good enough to beat Rambat and give a hard time to John Brzenk, can he have a chance against Samushia or not?
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that chance has everyone. Of course, he has the chance. He cannot say anything for future. Because he doesn't know. He doesn't know the guy. I understand.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, but he thinks that the chance, of course, he has. Okay, I understand, yeah. And we talk about İrakli, we talk about Genadi, we talk about Zurab and the Samushia, and what does he think about Prudnik and Matt Mask? Oh, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that Evgeny is the strong guy.
SPEAKER_03: Because with Morozov, he was very good. But he didn't want to say anything for the future. I understand. But he said Mask is a strong guy too. I understand. So it looks like he will be a good one. And it looks like he doesn't have much...
SPEAKER_00: to say about the other matches. And I want to ask him what he thinks about the, since he cannot predict any match, is it the same about the Devon and Levan? I will pick up on that. Mr. Levan is much more difficult. All right, Khalimah, Levan. All right, all right, he said more, so it's interesting.
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that every match will be very interesting. Oh, so he doesn't see even Levan as a favorite. He thinks that anything can happen. Okay. Say again. So he thinks that
SPEAKER_03: Anything can happen. He doesn't see Levan as favorite. And he said that he can say that Levan will beat him for 100%. Levan will be winner.
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that Levan is too strong. Yeah, he thinks that Levan is too strong. So he cannot say about the picture, but about this one he can, huh? Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he thinks that Levan beats him. I understand, I understand, yeah. If Levan will not got any car crash or some accident, Levan will be winner. Okay, if there is no accident for Levan, then he's going to win. Yes.
SPEAKER_03: He will not hate him and he will be in good shape. He will win for 100%. I understand. Is it the same, you know, even if Devon does an open arms up roll, he can still win? He thinks that Levan, nobody can stop Levan. Seriously? Very strong? Yeah?
SPEAKER_03: Today, did he try a little bit with him? It's not hard, just a little bit. But he felt him so strong? He said, no, they did not try hard just for training. I understand, but did he feel Levan so strong, he felt him?
SPEAKER_03: Yes. Too strong. He feel that he strong, Lewan is too strong, yeah. So Rewas couldn't even move him at all? No, it was, yeah, they don't want to damage each other, and they did not try so hard, but when he
SPEAKER_03: um but he think leon now it's too strong but the his time will come his time will come when he beat leon too oh that was that was that was as a goal to beat levan uh of course why not
SPEAKER_03: oh yeah very soon oh so he he has he has he has a dream to become number one in the world when he is hundred percent
SPEAKER_03: He think that Leon is too strong. He he he's about to train, train, train and. After that. Train hard it will be. Came this time. But not. There was the time that it was the 11th dream to be.
SPEAKER_03: leon but the time is changed time change you understand no say again he he said that it was the time that leon's dream was between the rivers but time changed oh i understand yeah yeah and then will time change again
SPEAKER_03: uh he believes so that's he if he will try and training why not he he believes this he he don't like he don't like the trash talk or something he's just
SPEAKER_00: Because, you know, we Georgians and we have to control every word, brother. You know, we don't like it. Yes, yes, yes. But it is nothing wrong and nothing disrespectful to want to beat someone. It's no disrespect. I mean, so it is normal that, you know, he can want to beat Levan. It's not a problem, you know.
SPEAKER_03: we are very close friends we almost one family and just for fun we live almost every day we are together and he's just fun yes they they close friends you know i understand i mean tell him that you know
SPEAKER_04: If he wins this time, and then we will see him again in Istanbul.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, but if he loses... He said that he's about to train more and he is not about to stop because he said that in fast he was, don't take this arm wrestling so seriously, but he wants to now take it seriously.
SPEAKER_03: He was used one and a half around two months for a champion for Europe, but he's going to go hard right now and he he don't want it to stop. I understand, so he's very determined this time. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: if he wins against michael todd we will see him next time if he doesn't win then i would suggest him to train more and then come back a little bit later when he is when he is 100 percent yes
SPEAKER_00: If he will lose this match, he will train 10 times more. Can you tell him anything he wants to add before we finish? Because he doesn't want to say so much opinion about other matches. He doesn't want to say so much about his match.
SPEAKER_00: not much to not much to uh talk but it is interesting that you know just because he didn't train he went down to so low even with two months training he came hardly to 40 percent i mean i i it's just very surprising that he lost so much power
SPEAKER_04: All right. All right.
SPEAKER_03: he said that around three months he every day training every day and thank you thank you thank you for this invitation again he's very happy yeah for this match
SPEAKER_03: and he's very happy about your comment that you think that rewas can beat too many people's in top 20. yeah i mean engine yeah he i i just thank him also that you know uh for accepting my offer and coming here uh we are honored and
SPEAKER_04: Of course, he's very, very strong guy. And if he really trains even harder, harder, I'm sure that he will be a threat for almost anyone in the world.
SPEAKER_03: yes he thinks that you are professional and if you think um about any person that he is strong and he can beat almost everyone yes he believes he thinks about you that you are professional and he was very happy with so uh your comment on this video
SPEAKER_00: No, no, that is the truth. That's the truth. You know, I know him. I know him very well. And I know how hard time he gave to Levan in Antalya World Championships. And I know that if he really gives himself 100% to arm wrestling, and then I'm sure that he can do great things. He has the potential. His height is, I mean, the hand height and then his top roll, his wrist, everything is strong. He just needs
SPEAKER_04: more horsepower with more horsepower i think he can be very dangerous thank you thank you he said thank you yes so tell him that
SPEAKER_00: we see him in about 10 days and or maybe like what 12 days and we will pick them up from the airport and then we will have good time all together and tell him that i wish him the best and just tell him to get rest now no more training just rest
SPEAKER_00: Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. So take care. Take care. Okay. Yeah. Anyways, guys, you want to ask anything?
SPEAKER_00: about this. As you see, Revaz is a guy that... You can go, Revaz. I'm talking with the people here, Chet. Yeah, yeah. Anyways, you guys, as you see, Revaz doesn't like to give so much his opinions about the matches. And he likes to say that table is going to
SPEAKER_00: show what it is. The only match that I think he was 100% sure, first he said that, you know, it's his table, we'll show. And then he said that, you know, he's 100% sure that Levan is going to win against Devin. That is the only thing. The 40% thing was interesting to me. Of course, these are elite athletes and they, whatever, they, they,
SPEAKER_00: whatever they say, and at the same time, I'm reading your comments here. So whatever they say, what it is, you know, I can't question what they are saying, but that is interesting that, you know, he's still a young guy, you know, just because he didn't train some years, him to be trained near two months and then hardly reaching 40% is interesting, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: that's interesting yeah a lie with larat and levan will be interesting i can do that but not not before the east versus west i'm extremely busy and it would be um unfair to my events while these guys are the like best guys in the world maybe they are not where the best superhero ways but as you see that most of the best guys on under 110 kilo are here
SPEAKER_00: and i think we need to give them a support and mind games and trolling yeah i think mind game is good trolling is good as long as it is you know good level you know as long as you know if it is um out of control then then it is uh maybe it is creating some kind of hatred
SPEAKER_00: not between the athletes but also in the community as well yeah he said 40 50 i don't know the guy said 40 but yeah it's still you know like 50 is you know how it is my friend like if you can just if you do with number if you can your best uh scott your health motion is 50 kilo now you are doing 20 or 25
SPEAKER_00: So I mean, that is the surprising thing, you know, like, after two months of training, especially like, where was it like to 10 kilo 15 kilo? I mean, so that is why it's interesting. But yeah. Guys, please, like as long as nobody is insulting anyone, don't
SPEAKER_00: uh black people can stay in the chat but i would respect i would ask them to respect what we are trying to do which is promoting our event this event is you know it's not my event guys this is your event the east versus west is your event and it will continue as long as uh you guys support once you say that it's enough we will stop there you know as i said many times it's not my profession
SPEAKER_00: I'm not a professional organizer. I just love armwrestling. I love the community. I love the athletes, especially. I love all the athletes. But it is very, very hard. Like, 5,000 people, just example, start doing this armwrestling. And then only, like, a handful of athletes will reach to the elite level. You know, it is a very hard thing to do. So that is why I try to promote their level.
SPEAKER_00: yeah king of the table for a few times i'm planning to go there to the dubai for the king of the table and i couldn't make it but this time i really want it let's see how it will be good afternoon from turkey to greece can you bring buttwood to our muscle i don't know i can't promise that guys um
SPEAKER_00: guys uh i will just say that because of the the global uh problems with the economics and the the energy prices and everything airplane tickets hotel everything in this event i was thinking that you know i should do even a little less you know with expenses than last time but it it costs about 15 20 percent more than last time
SPEAKER_00: And so I can't promise that I'm going to set so many matches, but I will probably set around 10 matches for August, but not more than that, because I don't know how much support I will get for the event.
SPEAKER_00: uh non-outfit for press conference okay black suites for the press conference okay the press conference also uh hermes will be joining you know i'm sure that you know um i'm sure that uh he was still the pot there you know i don't know what he's gonna do but he's coming he's coming he bought his own ticket and coming here and then of course his hotel is ready and
SPEAKER_00: What does he want to face? I don't know. The guy is gone. I can ask him anyways. You'll see Hutchings. Listen, Hutchings versus John is, I will set two Americans or two North Americans to each other's
SPEAKER_00: only when it is like no other solution for the title match that we know these two guys are the best guys and they need to pull each other you know that is my opinion but you guys we will decide all together you know right now um i don't like that horse that we start trash talking become more and more popular one of us favorites yeah
SPEAKER_00: Did you guys see the Morozov's video response to Matt? It was interesting, you know. Okay, I'm not going to go into there. I'm not going to get involved. Yeah, that's also possible. You are welcome, my friends. Yeah, I mean, if they invite me, I will go. Thank you, guys. Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: I'm thinking about more WAF athletes for the August event. There are a lot of athletes that really deserve to be at this stage and then we will see. I want to do a title match
SPEAKER_00: Travis, this time is not coming. Maybe for the future, yeah. Yeah, let's see. Before we set any more matches, I already set some matches for the August. But because I thought that we were not going to organize the May event, now then suddenly we decided to organize the May event. But the matches are there. But let's organize any match for the August
SPEAKER_00: by looking at the considering the results of the making of the nothing of the East versus West three events. Tell us for the armistice winners get to pay more or money is guaranteed. Money is guaranteed type. I do. But you know, the things are changing. I may go even by winning rounds, I may go just whatever, you know,
SPEAKER_00: Maybe Travis Pageant. I don't know. I invited Travis for the commentating, announcing type of thing. We couldn't agree with each other. But about the arm wrestling, I would invite Travis only if he really gets serious. But he doesn't look very serious.
SPEAKER_00: Hermes versus Dave is possible, of course, if they beat Genadi, if they beat Genadi, if. And then, and if both, they both agree, then Dave versus Hermes, I would like to do that, yeah. Yeah, Oleg Zok is, in fact, Timi is set for August. If he is still ready, he is set with Dadikyan. And if Oleg...
SPEAKER_00: doesn't want to pull if he's not ready because you know in what kind of situation he is in then then i will have to find another opponent for that again yes get hello alexander is one of the guys but just guys remember i can invite everyone like if i invite everyone there will be like all those names mentioned there will be like
SPEAKER_00: See, Oleg Petrenko, John, yeah, that's possible as well. But just imagine that, you know, 15 matches or 17 matches, you understand? Like, and if there is not enough pay-per-view, then I will be losing like $20,000, $30,000, you know, I need to set with just like about 10 matches. And when you say like 10 matches, then you really need to
SPEAKER_00: be picky you know about that if it was up to me if if i knew that you know it was going to be you know covered well then i would do every every month every one a half month but just remember it is also king of the table so king of the table has four events in a year i have for an event for events as well so we go one and a one and a half month you know like we did in
SPEAKER_00: February, they did like early April, I do in the mid May, or even a little bit later than mid, then end of August, sorry, June, and then I do in the August, they do at the end of September. So it looks like this is going. Yeah, so we will do for the August, early August, we do one,
SPEAKER_00: So I can invite the WAF athletes. And then I'm thinking that about November, mid-November, which is about a month after the WAF. So that's also good for the WAF athletes. Yeah. You're welcome. I don't know how to pronounce. You're welcome, my friends.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Davit is very strong. Or like Davit around the right now, you know, Russian athletes are you can you can your own self, you know, can arm wrestle with Sarah, I don't know who you are with. Russian athletes right now they are banned by all the international federations and so
SPEAKER_00: If I wanted to invite WAP athletes here right now, I can invite the Russian athletes or I will be also banned, yeah. Yeah, eight, 10 matches, yeah. Morozov, Dadikyan, yeah. Those are all good ones. Yeah. See, this guy is problematic, I think.
SPEAKER_00: You should also keep a card for yourself as well in East versus West. What do you mean I should set a match for me? I think I will put Rimebowen. Do I ever hold that sword in the back? What do you mean in the back?
SPEAKER_00: he can could easily surprise many people in the yeah the guy i saw him when he is training with laletin the guy is not normal yeah but um olex arm strength the the brachioradialis back pressure is different yeah i already invited dennis siplenko he said he's not ready yet
SPEAKER_00: and i don't know maybe he wants to do something in dubai first let's see how how it will be anyways guys if you guys don't have any uh questions or anything just uh remember uh next saturday is the last day for those those t-shirts i i remind this uh because after it finishes people are continue asking like oh is it too late to you know
SPEAKER_00: do the donation for the t-shirt and this and that just remember next saturday is like six days away is the last day because i i'm gonna check how many t-shirts i need to prepare and then that's how i will order i will tell guy to you know prepare this match and then that is why i'm asked to tell and remind you guys yeah donation machine used in one of the videos where did
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. I have here a place that is like a government place. They gave us a room. And then I told them that I need this kind of machine. And they found it. But I don't know where they found it. Yeah, Mindagos versus Yanis is a good match. But I think Neil is going to set that. It meant a sword that looked like a katana. Yeah. What do you mean? I just show it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: No, the katana is back there. And I have also Zülfikar here. This one. Katana they gave me in Japan when I went there about 18 years ago or something.
SPEAKER_00: What do you mean middleweight? There is middleweight matches, we also set it. There we will set even more. Yeah, I saw Bowen beat Larry, yes. 70-80, yeah, I said, if you guys remember, I said I versus Arthur Makarov. I said Bojidar versus Tony Kitowski, if you guys remember. And then for 70 kilo, we said Yusuf versus
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, Timmy, thank you. And can Ryan flash me the way that he hit Larry? Yes, probably he will flash me. Can I collect a t-shirt in person at the event? Yes, yes, you can. Can you try to open me earlier for the East versus West? Yes, I should do that, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: um i wish we could see more alonzo there we are me too me too i try not to cut the haters what do you think about larry as an arm master i think he needs a lot of experience you know in his experience larry as an arm master 20 times 20 swords yeah um what do you think about larry as an arm master in his experience he is strong but
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. It's late to say this, but happy Eid Mubarak. Same to you, brother. Yeah. If you guys realize that I also organized two other events, you know, before the East versus West started, there was best 78 kilo guys, eight guys. There was Yusuf, there was Bojidar, there was even Aktaev came, Minagos was there.
SPEAKER_00: and some other guys daniel prokopchuk was there yusuf was there yeah you should yeah you should uh was very good in early rounds is it okay if you were expected to enter the tournament to watch the entry payment yes yes that is that is it will be on the um
SPEAKER_00: There are like not so much room, so we invite Turkish people as an invitation of, you know, the athletes from nationals, like national team, some trainers and from the people from Federation. But it will be open to the foreign people with the interview. I'm not sure if I will beat him easy or not, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I will show. I'd love to see Yusuf in a future tournament. I mean, when you say tournament or supermatch. If tournament, then Yusuf is going to compete well. And if supermatch, Yusuf probably will have a supermatch in August.
SPEAKER_00: You guys also sometimes say the thing is stop showing of your arms. I don't know. Like I, whenever I see a mirror or camera or something, I just like usually can't stop, you know, and then I start looking not to show you, but I look at myself, you know, like, I'm like, I like to look at my forearms, not so much biceps, but the forearms I like to, you know,
SPEAKER_00: Thanks for doing this in English. Yes, I need to do it. King of the table for Yeah, we will discuss about King of the table. For when the time comes now I'm mostly focused on East versus West. Of course, I also asked the opinions of the especially the Georgian since Levan is from Georgia. And
SPEAKER_00: I'm sure. Yusuf versus Minda, Yusuf seems someone who would be able to turn Minda if possible. Yusuf versus Zloty type, that would make you the king of armors. You mean the tournament? I mean, yeah. You know, John Brzenk, he loves tournament, but whenever I talk with John, he said, yes, Engin, no, I'm not going to go to Europeans. Engin, the tournaments are good, great, but it's killing so many
SPEAKER_00: future super matches when the guys are meeting each other. He says that, you know, he says that, which Paul, Pauline, he said that, you know, when the guys are meeting, many guys are meeting each other in a tournament, it is killing the excitement of the super matches for the future. I don't know about Turabin.
SPEAKER_00: yeah in if sasha is ready last time i wanted to invite him to pull uh takashi's his chest was injured so if he's ready i would like to invite him yeah yeah my wish ryan the best yeah yesterday surprise me
SPEAKER_00: Those arms were like, I mean, incredible, you know, like, it didn't like 50 something arms. And he said he is 100 kilo and he wants to be 115 kilo. And I was like, like, like, how, you know, just like, like, I can't even imagine those arms are getting any bigger than you know, what they are, you know, just
SPEAKER_00: And whenever he said that he's going to beat John, after he's beaten John, he wanted to pull a super heavyweight guy. That was really surprising. They said that excluding Levan, he said he wants to pull, you know, yeah, super heavyweights. And then I was like, the guy must know something that we don't know.
SPEAKER_00: or he is overconfident. Will you pull Ryan Bowen officially? Not even officially, we will pull in East versus West in August. I don't know. Arsene was taller, much taller.
SPEAKER_00: than him yeah arsene but still i don't remember arsene being 115 kilo anyways guys i i in his confidence we will see zurab versus saisho
SPEAKER_00: Right now, Mete wouldn't be so good. Sasho is like 88, 87 kilo, while Zurab is like hundreds and maybe even more he plans to be. Engin, I will come to Turkey in August. Yeah, welcome. And then people find out who you are, finally. Everyone is a guest. I think you are from Australia, but I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Zorak versus Sona, yeah, that is good. Lethal Arms Network is Pauline. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. I'm forgetting. I remember from after the last chat, you know, he wrote some comments. Paul is a great guy, you know. Like, I don't know if there is anyone on this earth, at least in the armistice community that doesn't like Pauline, you know. I don't think that there is anyone. If there is someone, he must have some problems, you know.
SPEAKER_00: some type of problems here. Let's stop the beep, Bob Brown. I don't think so. Georgia versus, if they pull in last swath, I think they will also pull in next swath in Antalya. As long as you don't tell anyone. Okay. Okay. But you know, anyone from Australia,
SPEAKER_00: will be suspected, you know, we have, you will have Lachlan there versus Sandri Sedis supermatch. And then I will pull Ryan Bowen. And if there are only three Australians, and then that will be you. But if there are like more. What do you think about Tyron? Who is Tyron?
SPEAKER_00: This Nerea Nero guy, the disrespectful guy that has suggested me to pull Sarah Beckman, I will ignore you, my friends, because you disrespected me. I'm not going to block you, but to offer me a super match with a girl, you know, just shows that you have no respect. Devon Spires is watching. Subtabee for bottom eight. Carlos agreed. Carlos agreed about what?
SPEAKER_00: Guys, as you realize, I don't have a super chat option. YouTube was very unfair to me. And so what to do? But still, I enjoy spending time with you guys. In fact, until Pradeep convinced me till last December, I didn't have the monetizing thing, you know. Now only you will get cheats instead of...
SPEAKER_00: said that will take him for 10 minutes. We need to operate freeze and you know how to get that one in East versus West tell himself that we will be there. Probably our is the best and best sub to be might want to change his plan. Anyone is who is coming to my events from outside of Turkey.
SPEAKER_00: is my guest and well protected. Do you think Hermes can beat Kurdesha now? Anything is possible. Hermes is getting stronger, but until it's proven, we can't talk about it. We need to give it to Kurdesha. Kurdesha beat Hermes and period, you know, it finished. We will talk about more when the otherwise is proven. You know, guys, like,
SPEAKER_00: Tolkien is something, doing is different thing. We should never go by Tolkien. We should just consider what is done. I will do this, I will do that. Hermes doesn't say that, but even for the fans, I'm saying that it means nothing. I could be a better basketball player than Michael Jordan if I wanted, but I didn't want it. Did it make sense? No, probably not.
SPEAKER_00: Let us do it and then say that we did it instead of I will do it. Stevan definitely wants to meet Sabtabi. Did Kurdesha mess up preparation against Shafi? Genadi said that he can beat Kurdesha now. Again, we just talk. Genadi said that Ermes took Kurdesha lightly because Kadir Gali beat him.
SPEAKER_00: and did not train hard enough. I don't know about that. Let's see. Let's see. Let them do it, you know. Let them do it. It is good that people believe that they can, and I respect it, and it's very possible. But I will only consider when it is done, you know, instead of when it's done. If I can help in any way on the 21st of May, just let me know. Same here, Phil.
SPEAKER_00: You have been very, very friendly and very helpful and like good guy. You know, I consider you as a friend. Yeah, yeah. We'll be together there. Hermes himself said, Alex is stronger until proven otherwise in official match. He is humble after all. Yes, that is how it should be. Hermes did the right job. If he said that, that is the right mindset. Thanks for everything you're doing. You are welcome, my friends. You're welcome.
SPEAKER_00: Are you interested to invite Larry Wilson to your event? I invited him for Supermatch. He is not interested. I also invited him as a guest. I don't know if he can come or not. Genadi did not say he can't beat Kordesha. I understand, but even for Hermes, we need to see. It doesn't matter if it is Genadi or Hermes or something. It needs to be done. Devon has any chance against Levan. I really don't know their
SPEAKER_00: like current shape there are a lot of things to talk about that let's finish this uh east versus west two and like i will only focus on that match and i will share my opinions you know respectfully guys um i have been in this sport for a long time i paid all kind of prizes injuries everything you know tons of weights i have been lifting for 30 years so i
SPEAKER_00: um sadik yes dadikian and oleg is set for august and guys i i have i know enough to respect those athletes efforts and i as long as everything is fair and square you know i um how to say i will
SPEAKER_00: say bravo to the winner you know i don't care you know who is winning it's the same for east versus west too i don't care if the eastern guy wins or the western guy wins of course i promote the event just to hype the event of course this is normal thing but i have i have no you know i have no um i would say i don't really care who wins you know
SPEAKER_00: Like, I care about, you know, that event is run good, athletes are happy, the competition is fair, and then let the better ones win, you know. And what was meant is he feels like he has reached 40% of our yet he has never been on the percent. What he said he has always been. Oh, okay. Okay, that that makes some sense. But
SPEAKER_00: That I understand, yeah. Okay, so that now made sense. If he really said this, then that makes sense, yeah. Samushia versus Rustam, yeah. I would love to invite Rustam as well. The translation, in fact, didn't want to translate, he said,
SPEAKER_00: is not enough to do this, you know, good enough. But I asked that SC records, you know, I couldn't reach him because it was a last minute notice that Revaz said that he's ready to do that. And then I sent message to Roman and I couldn't get answers. So I asked this guy, he said, my English is not enough, but let me help, you know. So just no need to
SPEAKER_00: You know, these guys, what I do, what these guys do just on YouTube, just to promote arm wrestling, no need to do so much, you know, hard on them, you know, if they are not translating, they could, you know. So usually people, you know, makes fun, but they are doing their best. This is their best. They can't do any better than this one. I'm not going to really hire different translators from Russian and from Georgian or something, you know.
SPEAKER_00: And so they are just all helping me and helping the community. Samushia is already eight time War Chamber. It looks like he's still in his twenties. Yeah, because he started to be successful even as a junior guy.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he is in his 20s. Yeah, he's in 20s. I think, let me think, I think he probably won 2014 RAAF or something, I think, or when he was 18, so age, I think he's not like maximum he's 27 or something, my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: You're welcome, my friend. Thank you as well for the support. He's very, very smooth translating. Usually his connection is good too. I can help. Perfect Georgian, English. Yeah, some guys also. Yes. Anyways, these Georgian ones, I don't understand. So I hope that you are not writing. You're writing to your Georgian principal, right? Yeah, but it's a,
SPEAKER_00: Yes, Rustam is, I will tell you my opinion about the greatest arm masters like John. And then John is a hundred percent, you know, just like, it's not discussable. Then other guys, you can put wherever you want. I will just say in no order, that is Rustam, Zolaev,
SPEAKER_00: and Kaszewski, Cobra Rhodes, and Dave Patton, and Jambul Viblyani, John Walker, Devon Larratt, and Oleg Zok probably needs to do a little bit longer, a little bit longer.
SPEAKER_00: But I'm sure he's going to do because he's already doing great. Anyways, guys, so I think I better finish it. It is great to chat with you guys.
SPEAKER_00: iraqi and prudnik guys i can't promise anything right now prudnik is set with tata chings in august and iraqi is set with um john burzin for august but i will talk with the guy no no i'm inviting devon i invited devon to every event every event i invited if you are thinking that
SPEAKER_00: devin and i are not friends or something we are friends you know just more than you think you know we we the only thing is that we when we disagree because we both love arm wrestling and then like if it is something about arm wrestling the desperation move or do that he says that you know the match should directly start in the strap if only one guys
SPEAKER_00: one guy one so then then i feel responsible to raise my voice we may not agree but it doesn't mean that we are not friends and i mean of course sometimes things getting heated between us it did but like then everything is okay i i think that it will never come to that point again
SPEAKER_00: Can you make a video where you explain why John Brzee is unarguably the GOAT? It's obvious, but there are so many new fans who are ignorant. Yeah, I will talk with the guys after East versus West. After we know the results, then we may reconsider the matches, super matches for the
SPEAKER_00: um uh august august guys when if your shoulder is like this it's okay understand what i am against is when the when the shoulder is there and the arm cannot open anymore and you need to either break the arm or you just need to press so hard that you need to make the guy jump up you know that is like yeah yeah yeah lebanon is invited too but but
SPEAKER_00: You know, these guys right now, we can't disturb these guys. Until recently, Levan was the PL puller. We all thought that he had a contract and this and this. So, we did not really dare to invite him. But now, I think that after this one and until this match, Devon match finishes, we better not disturb neither Devon
SPEAKER_00: or Levan, let them focus there. We should not put anything different on their mind. Let them 100% focus there. But I, in their interview, I asked them if they would ever consider to be part of it. They said, yes, why not? It's OK. It's OK, Roman. It's OK. It is my fault. In fact, not so much my fault. Also, it's nobody's fault. Revaz said that he's available now. I asked him yesterday.
SPEAKER_00: And then I thought that you would be, you would be available, but I couldn't reach you. So I would do against Babaev. Yeah, that's interesting too, because it is not so easy to top roll İrakli. I mean, sorry, hook İrakli. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, guys.
SPEAKER_00: Dave you told Levan Devon will cheat in setup and he will take 10 minutes for setup? Dave you warned Levan that he will be on hostile territory? He should break WAP referees. Guys, I can't involve with this kind of things, you know. I can't involve. Levan is a grown guy and he probably will decide what is good for him, you know.
SPEAKER_00: um so it's not really my place to even comment about this kind of things that one is ready for all that cheating do you guys really think that there will be cheating you mean the do you guys mean that when you say like territory like do you guys mean that uh that one will be tricky or do you guys think that in the event there will be a
SPEAKER_00: setup you are saying that you know like Bill Collins will do something or this is what you are trying to imply or you are saying that Devon will use his setup tricks what what I didn't understand your point because you're talking about bringing refugees there Saginash really knows how to handle Devon it's all good I
SPEAKER_00: I only want the better one to win, you know. And so if Devon beats Levan, we're going to say, Devon, I mean, you did an incredible job. And if Levan wins, we're going to say you are still the king, you know. And yeah, that is. Yeah, we will see. We will see, you know, how it will be.
SPEAKER_00: Yep. I want to, I want to finish the conversation, but I like chatting with you guys. Um, that's interesting. Yeah. As long as, I mean, not, it's not interesting, but just, I just like kind of the month ago, but I need to finish it because the phone that I'm using, uh, for the zoom meeting, you know, as mine, but the other phone that I'm following the chat is my wife's phone. So.
SPEAKER_00: probably she wants her point. They mean with cheating those things was doing with John. I only hope there won't be any fight at that match. I don't think there will be a fight. It will be very unprofessional. So Devon, that's some people believe he can even take center from Devon.
SPEAKER_00: I told Devon that some people believe he can even take center from Levan. I don't understand what this means. Devon will report to start the match. He is openly talking about how he tired out Levan in first round set up. I hope Levan is ready. Are you on the pitch tonight with Neil? I don't think so. I have so much headache when I do this.
SPEAKER_00: uh youtube things you know every day every day every day it gives me headache i don't know if it's because of the that some kind of radiation or something that when i do live you hear about is getting back in shape i don't know i i shared with Travis about a week ago or something you know he told me he's not really interested to be like best armless in the world again
SPEAKER_00: physically and mentally, there will be no fight, otherwise Levan will be down. We should not do those kind of things. I think he would be sorry, but if they really fight while people are watching that thing, it will be shame, sorry, shame for them. Shame on them and then they will be shame for the community, for us, it's not good.
SPEAKER_00: I was right there in the winning. That Travis was just, he should have been calmed down a little bit. He thought that referee was gonna cheat. He was much better than Samarenko, but because he couldn't control his nerves, somehow the match ended 3-3. To see you work with Larry and organize more of these things for everything you do for arm wrestling,
SPEAKER_00: Ante, you're welcome, my friend. Thank you for the support. Enginbet Kilonian, have any chance to take part in Israel? Yes, he did. In the future, he can again, you know. I just can't again, you know. I can't, like, I need to organize, like, 15, 20 matches. And I can't really afford that, you know. And even the fans will be boring if it's, like, up to 20 matches or something. And I think I cannot cover the events. You're welcome, my friend.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, are you asking me something? Your thoughts on Prudnik, Hermes, and İrakli, who is the best 242 after John for you? I'm not sure if the John is the best 242. I think in my opinion, Prudnik right now, if John gets better than how he is now, then yeah, Prudnik, I mean, he may be Prudnik, but if they would like meet anytime soon,
SPEAKER_00: I would bet on Prudnik right now. But if John gets even better, then of course John has the potential. Of course the best of John would be best of Prudnik. But how close can John get to his best? I don't know about that. Yeah, this is exactly what I just said. Anyways, guys, you all take care.
SPEAKER_00: and thank you very much for following and then yeah it actually can be sasha right now because he is much heavier there is probably near 15 kilo difference between them but at same weight around 90 kilo it would be hard you take care timmy you take care guys and hope to see you with the next one i don't know who will be the next probably tomorrow i will do it hermes casparini um live
SPEAKER_00: and then we will continue and then you'll see. Thank you, Phil. Thank you. Take care. Bye bye.
