SPEAKER_04: About. Yep, drop came. Who's this? Yep. Hello, my friends. White wall. I don't know. I'm losing here. I need to also do some.
SPEAKER_00: How are you? I'm good. You?
SPEAKER_00: yeah i'm okay too i was just reading in the chat you know what people says so first of all i say um i would like to welcome you guys thank you for being part of it thank you gurgen for translation that you're going to help us and thanks to zurab for being part of us
SPEAKER_00: No, I cannot have super chat, guys. They monetize in a way for some stupid reason. Yeah. Hey, Zurab. Zurab, show us some bicep. How big are they? How big? They're now their biceps is 15 centimeters.
SPEAKER_00: 50 centimeters. Wow. More than he had with the rhombus. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can see that from his pictures. I can see that he's getting bigger and bigger. And every time I see him, I say he cannot get bigger than this. And then next time I see a picture and I was like, OK, he's bigger again, you know. Yes, he's gaining and gaining more. Yeah. Can you translate him?
SPEAKER_02: What I say. Okay. Let's see. .
SPEAKER_02: So Zurab is saying that in a couple months he will be add more 10 kilograms like on his muscles. So he will be the bigger next fixtures. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what's his weight right now?
SPEAKER_02: Yes. 100 kilos for now. He gained like four or five kilograms before the previous vendetta. Okay, so he's a little bit heavier than last time, he says. Yes, yes. He's heavier, like more four kilos. Okay, okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And his shape is like, can he say how much stronger he feels with the weights he's lifting? Is he like about 10% stronger than last time? .
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that he's feeling stronger for now and his power is like 15% more than he was. How much? 50% more. Fifteen. One five. Five zero percent more than he was.
SPEAKER_02: He was when? Against the last match? Yes. After Rombat, his power is like stronger twice.
SPEAKER_02: Zurab is saying that before the match with Rombat, he had COVID-19. So he did not tell anyone that he had COVID. And because of that, he can't train like he's training.
SPEAKER_00: so at this time his power is like a stronger like two times than wow yeah wow so okay because because um how does he feel that you know when when everyone is um um thinking that john is just gonna not even feel him and easily beat him he has no chance what does he think about all these comments
SPEAKER_02: Okay, I will translate. She's thinking that everyone thinks like that, that John Brans will beat him without chance.
SPEAKER_00: But it will be a big surprise if he will beat John Brennan. Yeah, it will be a surprise for sure. And can you ask him, of course, he's going to arm wrestle him and he needs to believe in himself. But can he tell us objectively how he really believes that, you know, the match, like the percentage, you know, how much chance he gives himself?
SPEAKER_02: Okay. What percentage do you think you will be able to achieve in the future? I don't know if it's true or not, but what percentage do you think you will be able to achieve in the future? This is a subjective question for me. I think I will achieve at least 30% if it's a subjective question.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, he's telling that like a 60% for my side, if I will be subjective at this point. And he gives 40% to John and 60% to himself. Yeah, that's good mindset. You know, nobody should go to an arm wrestling match that, you know, by thinking he's going to lose. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Also, he really looks strong, but John is very experienced, very experienced as well, you know, very knowledgeable.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think? I think it's a good thing, because it's a good thing that he didn't die, and he had a lot of chances, and he was very confident. But John was very brave, and I think he had a lot of chances. John helped Klauczyn, and he had a lot of chances, but
SPEAKER_02: For my subjective opinion, I don't care about the people and their opinions, and I don't want to say that John Goniath is a real favorite of mine, but I know my values, and that's why I would say that 80% is my opinion.
SPEAKER_02: So for now we are talking about John Buzeng that he's agreed that John Buzeng is a glut of armwrestling and also he knows that everyone likes Buzeng because he's really legend but he also knows how strong is
SPEAKER_02: for this moment and because that gives himself too big chance to win this uh much yes yes yes
SPEAKER_02: He can really understand the expectations from people, from fans of armwrestling. And he's telling that if I will be just a fan, like if I will see the situation like a fan, I also give my voice to Zeng. But I know my power. I know my strengths. So I'm sure that I will beat him. I understand. Yeah, I understand. Of course, he needs to believe in himself. I don't blame anyone that
SPEAKER_00: you know, whenever, you know, some of the people, uh, they, they don't know much about the, the, the, the athlete athletes, elite at this perspective, whenever they say that they believe in, in, in themselves and then people makes fun with it. Like, who are you, who are you that you think that you're gonna be? I mean, he needs to believe himself to go there to win, you know, that's, that's, that's like nothing to make fun with it, you know, anyways. So, um, what I was gonna say, so.
SPEAKER_00: um he he also has a match with ff does it does it think his chance is uh more than his chance against john against ff even uh
SPEAKER_02: Zurab is saying that he is really respecting his opponent but he believes that
SPEAKER_00: We are looking that he's much like a heavyweighter than Zurab, but he's thinking that his 100% will beat him. 100%. Okay. That's good that he has good mindset. I love it. I love it. Yeah. That is one of the important things. The confidence. You need to believe it. You can go anywhere. I like it. I'm happy also that he is not being like
SPEAKER_00: political in just saying that okay you know it's 50 or something you know like he really believes in himself and then yeah anyways um maybe you can also translate what i tell him because i actually telling this to him not to you but yeah yeah i know
SPEAKER_02: Thank you. Yeah, I mean, that's how it should be. Anyways, he said his weight is 100 kilo.
SPEAKER_00: For the East versus West, if this event is successful, I will continue organizing more and more. But the categories that I'm thinking will be like 75, 85, 95, and then 110 and super heavyweight. So does he also consider pulling in 95 as well, if I set him matches at 95 kilo as well?
SPEAKER_02: or is he thinking only for the 110 kilo category? Thank you. If this event is possible, I would like to say that I would like to share this information. I would like to know what you think about the future development of Iberdrola, whether it is possible to build it and now, in 2015, if it is possible to build it, if you are interested in it.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think you will be able to win the Super Heavyweight title? I don't think I will have a problem with the weight of 45 kilos, but I will be able to win the title. My goal is to win the title. I will be able to win the title. I will be able to win the title. I will be able to win the title. I will be able to win the title. I will be able to win the title. I will be able to win the title. I will be able to win the title.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Zurab saying that he will be continue gaining the weight. So he wants to be like in 110 kilograms or super heavy weight. So he did not want to lose weight. Interesting. Interesting maps.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that the time is coming. He's training more harder, more harder. He's gaining more muscles, gaining more power. So he will be ready for super heavyweights. He will be ready for everyone. Not everyone, not everyone.
SPEAKER_02: Leon is his friend, so... He's telling that Leon is the best, so I'm not thinking about this.
SPEAKER_00: But without Levan, I can have a match with anyone. Except Levan, he's ready to pull anyone? Except Levan, he can have a match with anyone. Okay, okay, okay. Very, very confident. I was thinking he was confident good enough for his upcoming matches, but I see that he's very confident, too confident even.
SPEAKER_02: You know, there is something that, you know, we can be strong, everything, you know, but
SPEAKER_00: there is something like this structure of human being, you know, the hand size, the arm height, you know, after a point, the things are getting very, very hard, you know, not, not that easy. So that's, I, I'm, I'm not like questioning, you know, uh, his goals, his dreams, but, uh, sometimes need to be a little bit realistic and it's hard to get a grip or, for example, with Latin or something, you know, whatever, anyway. So, um, there are, there are also some other super matches as well.
SPEAKER_00: If I ask him, you know, because since he's from Georgia and the men of the other matches are with the Georgians involved, and I'm going to ask him, but before I ask him, I want to ask him, you know, if his answers are going to be patriotic or objective.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, there are different views. There are different opinions, different opinions, but in my opinion, there are people who have different opinions. For example, they are against the law, they are against the law, and so on. But I would like to say that there are different views of Georgian people, and I am interested in what they say, and I would like to say that they have a patriotic motive and object to it. That's all.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, he's telling that he's very patriotic and he's supporting all Georgian arm wrestlers, but he will try his best to be very objective. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_04: Tell him to bring his legs down, you know, from his chest. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Tell him what he thinks about, let's start from Samushia and Pauline. Does he know Pauline? Samushia and Pauline, what do you think? Do you know Pauline? Yes, I know her very well. Exactly. I'm sorry, but I'll show you all the videos. I know her very well. I know Pauline from her videos.
SPEAKER_02: In terms of job opportunities, I would say that from the beginning, and now, there are opportunities. I would say that 90% of the job opportunities are there. Well, it depends on how you look at it. Of course, there are opportunities in this field, but there are many opportunities in the job, even if you don't have a job.
SPEAKER_02: So he's telling that he knows almost every arm wrestler. He's looking their videos, he's teaching their technique and respecting every arm wrestler. He really knows Samushia's strengths, Samushia's powers, and he's telling that Samushia will beat him. Like a percentage will be like 90% Samushia will be win. Oh yeah? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: 90% Samushia will beat, huh? Wow. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah? Wow. Interesting. Because Samushia, I mean, Pauline also gave some trouble to John Brzenk in the book. So that's interesting. If you beat him, easy. Let's see. Anyway, so what does he think about Lutidze versus Michael?
SPEAKER_02: Marisa, I would like to ask you a question, because we have a lot of questions from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, because we have a lot of questions from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, but I would like to ask you a question from the audience, but I would like to ask you a
SPEAKER_02: Theoretically, it is a theory, and then it is based on my opinion. It is possible to say that it is not the same as Nebismirtan, but it is the same. I think that Shirat is saying that Tamashov is the author, that Tamashov is the author of Shostakov.
SPEAKER_02: Zurab wanted to say something about Pauling vs. Bzeng. He's telling that John Bzeng is a really great armwrestler. He wants to show people like a really nice hooking. So he's first hooking.
SPEAKER_02: He wants to know about the power of his opponent. He's not really going so heavy for the first time. And he's playing for show, but he's thinking that John Bzerg easily can beat Valiant. I would like to add something to Mike's point. Lutidze is a very good player, and I agree with him.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to say that if Rezo was able to work in a stable way, and now he is as strong as he is now, there would be no chance for him to win. But from the current situation, I think that it is 50-50, because there is no one in power in the whole country, because there are all the countries. But I think it is 50-50, because it is clear in the report that
SPEAKER_02: Zoua Seymgoud, Lutijez had little time to be preparing very well, so he's thinking that also Mike Todd had bad matches, he lost last time, so he thinks it will be like 50-50. Oh, 50-50, he will say, okay. Yeah. I understand, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And what does he think about İrakli versus Tartashins? What do you think about İrakli versus Tartashins? I think İrakli is better. But I think Tartashins is one of them.
SPEAKER_02: He's telling if the match will start like İrakli will be beat for the moment, for the start.
SPEAKER_00: He will be win, but if hands will be stopped, Atchik will have more chance than İrakli. Okay. So if the match stop, İrakli has less chance, you say? Yes, if hands will be stopped and if they will be wrestling like a hook. I understand. Yeah, that will be interesting match as well.
SPEAKER_02: as you say and what does he think about the other matches uh
SPEAKER_00: He's saying that respect from me, but Arif will beat him. Arif will beat him, yeah. And Barboza versus Tobias Sporrong, right arm? 100% Barboza. Barboza will beat him, okay. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: And Morozov vs. Derek? Derek vs. Morozov. Derek is one of the players that I think will win the tournament. I think Morozov will win.
SPEAKER_02: He is thinking that Morozov will be in this match. He will be. And Matt Mask vs. Prudnik? I think Matt Mask will win against Prudnik.
SPEAKER_02: He is telling that Mask will be fighting like aggressively in the wrist but at the time Prudnik will beat him.
SPEAKER_02: Left arm match with Morozov and Matt Mask. Also Morozov because Matt Mask's left hand is not strong enough.
SPEAKER_02: And what does he think about the Tobias left arm and Prudnik left arm? Difficult to say. Prudnik is a favorite.
SPEAKER_02: 15-15. It's difficult to say 15-15. If they go on top row, Tobias is better, but if it goes to biceps hook and then rooting is better, he says.
SPEAKER_02: If hands will be stopped, footnik will beat you.
SPEAKER_02: Tobias had one chance. He had to finish on the start. If he had to stop, he will lose. And the superweight match, Dave Chaffee and Genadi? Superweight match, Dave Chaffee and Genadi.
SPEAKER_02: He's sending his side to Genadi. But he thinks and he will see.
SPEAKER_02: What do you say? How do you translate what? He will explain right now what he is thinking about this match. It will be a large talk, so I will translate permanently. Okay. Polo Beriochi, Genadi Skadatsev is in the hook, on the knee and on the bicep, and Echa Vardishev is in the back.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know how he is doing, but he is doing well. The last time Genadi had a problem in hook, in toproll, as I looked, but he was training very hard and his form is like optimal for now. When Genadi and Chef met, they were very close.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think that Sheffy will be able to win in that form? He had last chance and Sheffy wins like a 4-2 versus Genadi. And I think Sheffy can't be in a better form as he was at that match. And what about Genadi?
SPEAKER_02: But for now, Genadi is in better form, in better shape, and he is stronger than he was at that match. So I think the chances will be like 70-40 for Genadi. 70-30? Yeah, okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, I understand. So he believes that all the Georgians will win, except Lutidze 50-50. Lutidze 50-50?
SPEAKER_02: almost 50 50. because I don't know uh can or not exactly like finish on the start I understand I understand I understand and and he thinks that you know he's gonna beat John and he gives himself 60 chance and if he beats John who wants to pull the next
SPEAKER_02: What do you think about the fact that Nambilad Mougev is a young man and he has a 3% chance of winning? If Mougev is a young man, he will win and then he will lose, right? Yes, he will win. If he is a young man, he will win and then he will lose, according to Levan.
SPEAKER_02: okay he's thinking that yes he had a chance like a 60 percent to win this much but he's saying that he can like reach anyone almost everyone but he wants someone from heavyweights
SPEAKER_02: I would like to say that if you become popular, you will have an interest in sports. If you are active in sports, you will have an interest in me. I would like to say that if you do not have an interest in sports, you will have an interest in me.
SPEAKER_02: he wants to pull someone who is like every time is pulling every time on the tournaments is popular and in good shape good form and this will be interesting for people but he can say someone like for example someone but if if he really beats john as he believes then
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, then we can we can do someone, you know, heavier. Let's do that, you know, because because I think that John will be probably around that weight class will be the biggest win for him, you know, to be John Brzenk. If he beats John Brzenk, then yeah, I mean, he will have a chance with anyone at least under 110 kilos.
SPEAKER_02: In my opinion, if John wins, it will be a big advantage for the team. And if John wins, it will be a big advantage for the team. And if John wins, it will be a big advantage for the team. That's my opinion. But I think it will be a big advantage for Super Rugby. I think it will be a big advantage for Super Rugby. I think it will be a big advantage for Super Rugby. I think it will be a big advantage for Super Rugby.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that his optimal form is not for now. He can gain more. He wants to be like 115 kilos. So he will be better next time. He will be stronger next time. So he will be ready to hook with like heavier guys. I mean, even now, you know, whenever I look at him,
SPEAKER_00: he doesn't look normal you know his two arms looks bigger than his like chest size you know just like whenever i look at him when i cannot even imagine him being like 115 kilo i think whenever he sits like this we will only see the arms you know next time we see
SPEAKER_02: He will try to get bigger like a chest, back and every muscle, every organ. So he will be bigger, hold.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah i mean he already looks interesting very interesting with that 50-centime arms you know with with the how tall is he 175. um
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that it's not really minded if you have no long fingers or long hand. The main thing is your hand does not open.
SPEAKER_00: and long hands also can open but really thing and main thing is that you have to hook and your hand is not opening or i understand i understand yeah i understand i i i really hope that you know he will be successful he will be very very uh does he does he realize that you know uh that john's coordination of the muscle groups
SPEAKER_02: and is better than Rambats. I know that it will be very difficult for you, but if it is possible, what is the coordination between you and Rambats? It will be very difficult for me and Rambats.
SPEAKER_02: He's telling that with John, it will be much harder than it was with Ron. He's saying that with Ron, his hook is not really strong.
SPEAKER_02: And he was taking whole much like on the biceps. And now he hooked with biceps. For now, he had a better hook. After the fight, everything was fine. But in the other form, he was in a bad shape. And with the details of the fight, everything was fine.
SPEAKER_02: after the match with the rhombus he had hurting hand like a two couple weeks he was like a little uh problem on the hand
SPEAKER_02: But after training and training, he had weak sides like on the fingers, on the wrist, on the shoulder, on the biceps. And he's saying that after my trainings, my weak places are stronger. So I believe. I understand. I understand. Yeah. Anyway, so is there anything he would like to add? How many days is he going to rest before the event?
SPEAKER_02: Before the match with Rombat, he...
SPEAKER_02: he had like arrested six days and the seventh day was a much but for now uh he's gonna rest like 10 days oh 10 days okay yeah i understand i understand like can he tell us like how much how much like a bicycle he can do like like like like like marble core it's absurd
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that the standing curl, he can like a 130. 100 how much? 130. 30. 50? 30.
SPEAKER_02: 50 with three zero or 30 130 yeah okay okay uh-huh okay okay yeah he can he can do full motion full motion um
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that if I was standing with clean biceps, he can do like 110 kilos. But if he will be cheating, like standing on the legs and moving, he can like 140 kilos.
SPEAKER_02: He's more attentionable when he's standing and curling. But because he's thinking that this training giving more power and more strength for his hands. Okay, I understand.
SPEAKER_00: And one last thing I want to ask, how, like, do you think that he is going to beat John? He thinks that he's going to be able to hook him or he's going to beat him with a flat wrist? Or is he going to, I mean, I know that whatever it takes, he's going to do, but does he believe that he can hook him and beat him?
SPEAKER_02: Do you think John will be able to get to the start or will he be able to get to the hook? Do you think he will be able to do it? John won't be able to do it. I don't know if he will be able to do it, but I think he will be able to get to the start.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that John never pulls from the start like he's every time he's like a waiting opponent.
SPEAKER_02: If he will start first with a start quickly start he will try this for a winner position and after stop hand and the fight but also he thinks his stronger side is a shoulder and he also can like a fight with shoulder
SPEAKER_02: I said it was the last question, but it also came to my mind. What does he think about Levon and Devon? Devon is a legend.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I agree, but I think there is no chance for Levani to win.
SPEAKER_02: He's respecting Dejan Larat. He thinks that Dejan Larat is absolutely legend also for armwrestling, but at this time Levan is very super heavyweight. He is very strong and Dejan has no chance versus Levan.
SPEAKER_00: Evgeny if he goes to the open arm top roll like this, it doesn't matter, no? If he will try to open hand the top roll, maybe his hand will be broken, so it will be better if he will not try this. Oh, okay, I understand, I understand. So this is no chance, huh?
SPEAKER_00: There's no chance. Yeah. Anyways, so can you tell him that I thank him and if he wants to add anything before we finish and I wish him the best and to see him in two weeks, not even two weeks in 13 days 12 days. Mask him if he wants to add anything more before we close. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think will be the next step? What do you think will be the next step? What do you think will be the next step? What do you think will be the next step? What do you think will be the next step? What do you think will be the next step? What do you think will be the next step?
SPEAKER_02: He wants to thank you for this event. He thinks it's a really great event. And he thinks that you can choose the opponents. Very good.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that
