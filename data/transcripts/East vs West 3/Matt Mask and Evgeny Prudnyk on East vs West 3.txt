SPEAKER_04: I was so surprised at the press conference when you started talking and I was like, I didn't know that you were speaking. So it was, it was very good because you are very colorful person. And I think if you learn more English, then I mean, you will be very, very, I don't know how to say entertaining guy, because you are very skillful about arm wrestling, your technique, your power, your hand control, everything is super, but you need to just to
SPEAKER_04: uh western side of the money and the learn many language polyglot yeah i mean at least english would be like universal language so like western people will know you more when you communicate you know with the with them you know so that is why i think you are very important figure in our sport in in many many aspects you know also you can sing right
SPEAKER_04: yeah anyway so still didn't come we are waiting um how did you like your poster do you like it um repeat please you know your poster
SPEAKER_04: together with Matt, you know, like posing, Istanbul view. Super. Yeah. Very creative. Yeah, I believe so. Yeah. One guy, one guy that I met and he, it was his idea and I liked it because usually you have the pictures and nothing else, but now the Istanbul view together. Yeah. I think it looks nice.
SPEAKER_04: and so when when matt comes will you be political or you will be straight open you know about your thoughts you will you will say whatever you think or you will be political little bit no no you mean now in this conference yeah yeah
SPEAKER_04: We talk about this and we want to speak only about our religion. No, no, no. When I say political, I don't mean about the war or something. I'm talking about sometimes people think and talk. Can you see Matt? Rudnik, do you see Matt now? No.
SPEAKER_04: you just you need to just pull the page like to the side way you need me to move what if i talk can you hear me now see me now we hear you yeah just i can see uh you or my mask change oh okay so whoever's talking whoever's talking shows up on the screen oh okay if we just pull the pull the page to the side way like this from the screen i think it will show all of us
SPEAKER_04: oh yeah yeah okay okay so how are you matt good you good good great great to see you and what was how long time it is going to be about 11 months like you were here almost one year like june yeah almost one year june june will be a full year so yeah june 12th was the last time east versus west one you were here
SPEAKER_04: And now I'll tell you after that flight, after that flight, I said, never fucking again, but it's, uh, it doesn't seem that bad anymore. It was because of the conditions of that time, you know? Oh yeah. Yeah. It'll be a lot better this time. I don't see any problem, you know? Yeah. We were talking, we were talking about you.
SPEAKER_04: i asked him you know is he going to be political about his thoughts you know or he is going to be straightforward and so this is what we were talking so you just had a super match with tim yeah and like frankly you know you kind of had some little bit of problem with the nervous like control with your nerves or something you know just like one round i started i saw that you were starting kind of i mean do you think that do you think that if you had a little bit
SPEAKER_04: I don't know, like control, then I didn't think that you I mean, maybe one round. I didn't watch all of them, but one round I saw that he took your wrist and then like more rounds. I see that you were in the step. You were just you had the full control, you know? Yeah, I had a game plan.
SPEAKER_02: that uh didn't quite work out as well as i thought it was because everybody that knows tim tim likes to come across the table this way like a hammer curl i tried to set up with my elbow on the inside of the pad so when we went i drive my elbow to the outside and try to immobilize this on him a little bit and
SPEAKER_02: Starting like this with him in that angle to already to get him cracked out of it was a lot harder than I anticipated it to be. I needed to adjust. Once I started setting my elbow a little more to the outside of the pad, I was able to get more hand control and everything else. But it was trial and error, right? You're going against somebody that you've never arm wrestled before. You've never gripped up against. All I can go off of is what I've seen everybody else do.
SPEAKER_02: and everybody that i've seen drive forward on him and everybody i've seen drive backwards on him has always struggled in order to be able to get his hand opened up or get him in a vulnerable position so i figured you know what i'm going to try something new and hey it's the way she goes sometimes right so yeah what i saw was when you were trying to control his pronator
SPEAKER_02: his pronator felt strong. But whenever you went, your move, your own move to the outside. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And I do that a lot, right? I always second guess my kryptonite, like my move or whatever, and try to dissect it a little too much and try to come in with something new. I've done it against Jerry. I've done it against Hutchins. I've done it against
SPEAKER_04: you know, but it's, it is what it is. Right. So it's all it's all part of learning and adopting. Right. So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. Yeah, I understand. But I mean, like, how I feel is like, just two weeks later, pull him again,
SPEAKER_02: that things could be different. I think so. I personally believe that. And the way it ended, the way how everything unfolded, I think it just sets it up for an opportunity for that match has to happen again, right? Just to get a full... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now people would be curious to watch a rematch. Yeah, they'll be more interested in the sequel than they were the first go, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So...
SPEAKER_04: uh i talked with brutnik he said he said he was 110 kilo the last time he came here when he beat uh morozo and yeah under 107 kilo but he's training and gaining weight probably i want him down to 101 kilo yeah i think go down my question here what is wrong with your wrist oh i well round one with tim
SPEAKER_02: After I fist-fucked the table there, I ended up, I thought it might have been fractured, so I went and see my physio today, but it's not fractured. All it was was just, I just got a sprained tendon, just that sprained tendon that comes down here. So it's just to help mobilize it for the next couple of days throughout training, but I'll, yeah, it's not gonna slow me down. Yeah, yeah, I understand. Yeah, I understand.
SPEAKER_04: uh, Evgeny, people thinks that majority of the people thinks that you are favorite of this match. And how do you see this match against Matt? What do you think? Matt with me? Yeah. Yeah. What do you think about Matt? When I offered you this match, you were not so confident. You were saying that like, like 50, 50, you know, it's possible, but
SPEAKER_03: But whenever I said it, now, whenever I read, people are like, oh, this is a no good match. You know, Brutnik is going to win and this and that. Do you see this? How do you see this match against Matt? I think that very interesting match for me to fight with him, with Matt. I know, but I know already what I...
SPEAKER_03: uh what i going to to do to do with him what i'm going to do with him i know uh i know uh what technique uh to use with him uh and uh now i work uh on it specifically yeah but you also have trained in the in the now i train in my gym yeah
SPEAKER_03: But do you also have alternative plans? I have plans, yeah. But now I don't want to show him because I don't want to start. Listen, listen. Evgeny, are you confident about winning? I...
SPEAKER_04: can say only i try uh hook and top roll that's all yeah yeah but like do you feel that you will win yeah of course yeah yeah and and you said that you made your plan and are you brave enough to tell us your plan or it's gonna be surprise
SPEAKER_04: it's surprise i i don't want uh to show the card okay i understand i understand yeah i understand yeah and and matt how do you see this match i know i see it i see it going one or two ways
SPEAKER_02: I see it either being a war or me making myself look like a fucking fool. So, but no, it's, I don't know, like I said, there was nobody on the planet I'm scared to grip up against. Obviously, as soon as you said, asked me if I wanted to match with him, my gut started turning because
SPEAKER_02: He's Evgeny fucking Prudnik, right? The man has, you know, banged with the best of the best on the planet many times over and over and over again. Every time you see him, he seems to look better every time he steps to the table. So, but it's something like that also, you know, wants to make me push harder and,
SPEAKER_02: you know that's that's what i want right i want something that wants to make me push because i'm not going anywhere so it's you know the more the challenge the harder i'm going to push the bigger the stronger i'm going to come in so yeah it all depends you know if you believe yourself or not i mean if you believe you can do it
SPEAKER_02: then I mean if you see there is a possibility and then of course you should just go there internationally prove yourself I honestly believe I honestly believe if I'm if I'm as fresh as I can be um as strong as I'm able to be and injury free I personally think I can bang with any man on the planet
SPEAKER_04: So if I'm in a good mindset and everything else, I don't think there's anybody on the planet that'll just walk right through me. I talked with Ermes. Ermes also thinks that, you know, it is a very close matchup. He said that, you know, he pulled with you and he says, you are a very dangerous guy. And he says that you are very smart with the hand and everything about your start. And he thinks that, you know, you have a chance, you know, to beat him.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but I don't know like why people, because like I saw, I saw Rudnik a little bit having problem with Ongarve when he top rolled, but he hook him. But like, when did you get like hooked by a good hook puller? You know, usually like, especially round one, round two or something, if you don't get tired or something, I see that your,
SPEAKER_04: like fresh start is very hard to be hooked. Am I wrong or am I missing something, Matt? I don't really think there's anybody on the planet that's got me into a hook that's wanted me in a hook. Yeah, so that is why I'm saying that once you're unable, if you can't enable Krudnik's hook,
SPEAKER_04: then then the only other option he will have is just trying to uh top roll you so then then then that is also you are very good at it you know we will see you know i'm not saying that you know you're gonna be or he he's gonna win but i think that you know many people um underestimates you
SPEAKER_02: as you know i don't blame him for just how everything's transpired over the last couple matches i've had but it's also at the same token too i'm not pulling regular bums off the street like tim bresnan's nope slouch ermie's gasparini look what he's done in the last year you know what i mean so it's like yeah and i've still managed to pull off wins and was still in every one of those matches so it's yeah it's like no
SPEAKER_04: I think if I don't look at the score, you know, beginning of the match, fresh match, I don't know if it was because of both being fresh or it is because you choose wrong strategy as you explained, but beginning of the match, he looked better. And then later, or should you look better? You know, like if you, I mean, if you didn't, if you just safely, I don't know about the rules, I'm not going to discuss about the rules here, like other people does, but if you would just safely put your elbow in, you know,
SPEAKER_04: this strap and then i don't know i saw the the one round before when you just toppled him beat him and i was thinking that he was gonna go that way and then then you lost on fouls you know that that's yeah that that you know that's what i saw at least yeah the way it goes right yeah it is what it is so yeah yeah i understand uh
SPEAKER_03: yeah engine you you compare uh matt mask with uh on go bio yeah but uh but matt mask has bigger a lever arm than on your bio yeah this is a very big problem for me yeah yeah this one i am like a little arm like a lolly yeah maybe not that much but remember you just pull uh artem morozo
SPEAKER_03: is also as tall as matt yeah but you you didn't have much problem with him because uh after fight with lalitin i very good prepare for a bigger uh yeah and i know uh and i uh i think i know what i uh can do with uh this arms yeah tolerance huh
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Yeah. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see how it will go. And then I just can't wait. You know, I think everything will be so great. And last time that the press conference was a little bit, you know, friendly and funny. But I kind of expect this time to be a little bit more stressful than last time because
SPEAKER_04: That is how I feel right now. And I don't know why, but Pradeep didn't come. So did you watch Matt's Supermatch with Tim Breslin? Evgeny, did you watch Matt and Tim Breslin Supermatch? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You pulled Tim Bresnan about seven years ago, right? Yeah. But did you have a little bit like shoulder injury then? Yeah. Yeah, you had, right? Yeah. Yeah. I feel very big pain in my shoulder and I can't rest, you know. But...
SPEAKER_03: uh on on the fight i feel uh like so so uh fills my shoulder but uh after first fight uh um i feel pain here yeah because of your and lose other fights yeah it happened in the during the spartak zola match in europeans
SPEAKER_03: The shoulder injury? Your shoulder trauma happened at the European Championships against Spartak Zolaev? No, no. On this European Championship, but not Spartak Zolaev, my trauma was with
SPEAKER_03: uh latvian guy oh yeah yeah oh it happened in bulgaria in bulgaria with galimano on the european championship uh 2015. uh and after yeah yeah i am with this uh uh enjoy it
SPEAKER_04: pain uh i rest with spartak zaloev and feel pain very big pain and wrestling and win and wins him yeah there is a there is a super chat uh thank you for super chat will match be more than 110 kilo yeah 243 pounds in istanbul and what before that what was your weight against him
SPEAKER_04: uh my weight against him i was 245. and do you plan to be heavier when you come istanbul on the way i i'm hoping to be 115 if i can yeah 150 below 260 260 255 to 260 is where i'm going or it just takes me time to get there right so for sure you will be stronger in istanbul
SPEAKER_04: than the shape that you were versus Tim Rizzo. I sure fucking hope so. Yeah. That's the plan. That's the plan. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And, and there is another super shed. I think I saw, um, I don't know, light is coming to my eye, but that's the astrology.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you for super chat. Matt, is there anything you can do to avoid microphones when you're trying to hit against someone maximizing their pressure? Like depends against somebody like Tim. I don't think you really can hit into it because you got that up pressure. Somebody that's coming into a hook. It's a different situation, right?
SPEAKER_02: or somebody that's just dragging back but uh i know it's kind of hard to really drive off the goal when i hit when somebody's popping up like that to avoid the micro files the only way i believe that the micro files could be avoided is with a softer pad right yeah a little bit of play or a little bit of a cushion in there but yeah in istanbul uh istanbul events uh uh we will be using
SPEAKER_04: generally like waffles but we will not be calling the micro pulse we will not call in those unintentional jumps or a little bit you know those tiny things or you just move a little bit like it's different if you're you know yeah yeah yeah i mean of course like little little movements if you're on a stiff arm wrestling pad it's it's impossible to avoid them when you got two guys going in different directions right yeah so just
SPEAKER_04: feel free to arm yourself. I do, regardless, right? It's just how it happens sometimes. Yeah, that is how people will enjoy, you know, otherwise, you know, but, but, you know, you know, everyone, all of us, you know, we all know what is the difference about like those, those little jumps and then, you know, you know, doing this kind of things, you know, so I don't know. We will see. You were, interestingly,
SPEAKER_04: Evgeny, you tried to hook Artem Morozov without the strap and you were successful. You did not need the strap. Don't you feel better when you go to strap and try to hook? Do you feel better in hook when you try to, I mean, when you are in strap or no strap?
SPEAKER_03: i feel good my hook without strap with morozov i'll uh easy easy twist him and no problem and the second round after you beat him easy in hook why did you go to outside second round you just wanted to try something different
SPEAKER_03: uh in that instance second round second round you you went top roll it was it was because of the it was in strap yeah and why didn't start but i tried i i uh i um understood
SPEAKER_03: that I easy twist him without straps and easy twist him with straps I understood and I decided to try my top roll with him and Morozov in the second round very
SPEAKER_03: uh has position like very uh oh so much for my on my on my fingers okay okay yeah
SPEAKER_03: He rises my little fingers and I feel easy him pronation and I can hear when in top roll. I go way in
SPEAKER_03: lose position him lose position uh-huh if you wanted on round two could you still hook him without strap um two rounds yeah first round you mean i can't uh i can't
SPEAKER_03: yeah okay but second round i feel uh uh here many power uh on my fingers okay and i um decide that a lot better for me drop much yeah so you wanted to go to strap and then in this step you felt like it's better to top roll okay i understand yeah i was just curious you know if you were trying to uh
SPEAKER_04: Do something different or you had to do it or you choose to do it, I didn't know why it was yeah that's interesting you know yeah and but for sure for sure match like like in arm wrestling and the weightlifting we all know this not same thing.
SPEAKER_04: The Morozov looks like with more muscle, more horsepower, strong in the gym, but you need to know, you know, where to hit, how to start, you know, like, and, and about these kinds of things, you are, uh, in my opinion, no disrespect to him. He may be stronger with the horsepower, but, uh, I think that about technically you are making much less mistakes than he is making.
SPEAKER_04: And, you know, in our wrestling match, we all know that the beginning of the match is everything, you know, because you do your move, then you get your position. The other guys do his move, he gets his position, and you are very, very good at it, you know, positioning yourself right from the start. That's why I'm thinking that if you guys are in a very close strength level, I think that that match can go either way, you know, with respect to
SPEAKER_04: anyone. And he bread. Thank you, my friend for the super chat. Aloha engine, you know, I always get the show you love. Tell Vinnie that we love him here in Hawaii, and wish him the best with everything he does. Send Matt our love as well. And tell Matt. It's an honor to watch him.
SPEAKER_04: Every time he pulls, yeah. Yeah. You guys have so many fans. And your buddy, Kirsten, thank you for Superchat, my friend. It's an honor to watch this match live in Turkey and sporting my idol, Matt Mask. Thank you for making this match happen. I thank you guys for supporting. You have a huge fan base.
SPEAKER_04: And you, that huge fan base and popularity gives you some opportunities even overseas. Yeah. I don't know. I'm just a regular dude that don't know how to control myself. Right. Yeah. Yeah. But people, people likes it. That is how Neil called it. It was Neil, right. Gave you the nickname.
SPEAKER_02: no no it was he actually initially gave me halloween as a nickname okay yeah he wanted halloween but like neil's got like three boys so everybody's like halloween at his place is scary i got three girls right halloween at my place is about princesses and fairies and
SPEAKER_02: So it was actually, we had a sponsor that was wild horse enterprises and they used to do sand traps in the oil field here in Canada and went to WL event with their logo on us. And, uh, they thought that was my name was wild horse and that's how it just kind of took off from there. Right. Wow. That, that, that, that fits you very good. The other day I was thinking, I was like, yes, that, that, that is the guy after you winning the one round that I saw versus Tim.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, you were just, did you see that the one guy made a, uh, uh, some kind of clip or something in about you, you were hidden everywhere. You didn't see today. Yeah. Yeah. You should see that. Yeah. Yeah. It's what's the age. Thank you for your super chat. I, Evgeny, I don't want to ask anything about arm messing right now. Where are you? Are you in Ukraine? Stay safe, brother.
SPEAKER_04: I'm thinking about your country every day, fighting as much as I can. Yeah, guys, thank you. Thank you for your support. I talked with Evgeny and Evgeny also said that at the beginning of the live show, I said it, but I repeat again, Evgeny said that he doesn't want to right now talk about the war and he doesn't want to talk about the politics right now. He said that he wants to focus
SPEAKER_04: East versus West event. But thank you. Thank you for your support, my friends. Thank you very much. And I hope that stupid what we'll finish soon and then you will be you know, 100% can focus in on our missing again, a pretty game and he just he just left again. The the if there are some other matches that you know, I quickly want to ask your opinions. But before everything, Matt, like
SPEAKER_04: Can you say how you see your winning chance by percentage or no need? Like what my percentage of winning is? Chance, yeah, yeah. Your opinion, you know? In my honest opinion, I honestly believe it's a 50-50. It could actually go really well if I come in
SPEAKER_04: I don't see how I can't take that back. That's as good, you know, that that's the attitude, you know, like whenever I see that you and the people who should be like close to you, that things that is mismatched, it just like makes me like, like, how is it mismatched? You know? I mean, this guy, he has ability to take, I mean, almost anyone's wrist, you know, and you have taken, you have taken Devon's wrist, you have taken Hermes' wrist.
SPEAKER_04: You have taken, I don't know. They can present stress. Yeah. Yeah. Tim Brisbane. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What I'm just saying that like, like. Yeah. Yeah. No. Well, what I'm just saying that like, like.
SPEAKER_04: maybe you will not be able to take but who can say that you cannot for sure you know i don't understand that part you know oh maybe he will he will hook you and beat you i don't know but how can you how can you think that you know you can't you know there is always possibility especially about you i mean all you need to do you just come there big and strong you know just that's all you need to do and eugenie how you see your chance percentage against matt no just now um
SPEAKER_03: i think uh i have only 70 percent my power 70. no what's your winning chance against matt oh winning chance uh i mean uh 70 percent to uh 70 percent chance yeah but i will tell you something
SPEAKER_04: if you are really 70 percent my power 70 percent chance sorry about this if you are 70 he's gonna just eat you live there you understand but you are 70 but how much you will be when you come to istanbul are you there uh how much uh now you say that you say that you are now 70 but
SPEAKER_04: how much you will be when you come to istanbul um 95 one um i don't understand that uh repeat please you say that you say that your form right now 70 percent yeah yeah and about next month when you come to istanbul what will be your form yeah
SPEAKER_04: I think 18%, 85%. 85%, yeah. Then you will probably, you know, if it is true, if really 85%, then there will be some problems for you. And what was your form when you beat Artem Morozov? Huh? When you beat Artem Morozov, what was your form?
SPEAKER_04: I think your connection is bad or something. About Morozov. What was your form when you pulled Morozov? 100%. Oh, you were 100% when you pulled Morozov. With Morozov? 100%, yeah. Yeah, but how is it possible? When I offered you this match, it was only like
SPEAKER_04: one month after that month and then you you have been training now and like in one month you went down to what 50 or something i it's uh hard to think that way but anyway so another super shed thank you for super shed grant you both are my
SPEAKER_04: Two favorite athletes can't wait for the match. Thank you for your super chat, my friend. I don't know. What do you think about he says that, you know, if he was 100% in Istanbul versus Morozov and then when I offer him the match, like now he says that he's 70% and he has been training for weeks already. And is it possible someone to go at this young age from 100% to 50% in one month?
SPEAKER_04: I train every day only one month, but before I relax. You have been training for one month already? Yes. I understand, but since the Istanbul-Morozov match, two months happened. Two months. So one month you didn't train.
SPEAKER_04: now one month you train and you are only 70 so what i'm just saying that from hundred percent in one month no training where did you go to down to 50 percent how much can you lose power just because of not training one month oh that that's what i am thinking you know i mean
SPEAKER_04: whatever i don't know i don't know i think i think when you come to when you come to istanbul you will easily be 90 95 of your best okay my opinion oh sorry i'm not saying but you're just like i just even i'm like 47 years old even if i don't train one month i may go down to like maybe 75 or something and you are young so i don't think that you will lose that much but you know your numbers better than i do so
SPEAKER_04: I'm just sharing my opinion. So, Matt, if we go to the other matches, if we talk about other matches, do you know who Irakli is? Who, sorry? Irakli. Irakli Zrakashvili. Irakli, yeah. Training partner of Levan. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think that he has chance against Tatashins? And currently Tatashins looks some...
SPEAKER_04: I think he'll take his hand, but it's, I don't know, it takes a different kind of human being to be able to pin that arm once the hand goes, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They don't call him the side pressure king for nothing. So yeah. Best of five. So you, you think that, uh, how this is going to win? Uh, I think it's going to be a back and forth.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think it's going to be a complete dominance by any means whatsoever on any of the guys. So I think it's going to be set up. Rocky's going to adjust and then Hutchins will end up adjusting again and then he'll adjust. It's going to be a back and forth kind of kind of go. I can see I can see Iraqi take in the first round or possibly.
SPEAKER_02: So just, uh, I think he's a lot more explosive than, than Todd is. And if Todd doesn't get the great setting that he needs, I can see him losing the first match and then he'll put the brakes on. Then it will start to back and forth. Right. So you are saying that at the end, Todd is going to win? I think, I think Hutchins will win in the end. Yeah. And, uh, Evgeny, what do you think about the Hutchins directly? Who wins?
SPEAKER_03: I think Irakli, because he has very strong pronation and side pressure.
SPEAKER_03: and Hutchins lose him rest. But Hutchins great side pressure without his rest. I think first round, yeah, I think first round wins Iraqli, second round too. But third round, Hutchins has very
SPEAKER_03: great endurance and he can win Zerakashvili. And I think finish results, Hutchins win.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, Hutchings win, yeah, because of the endurance, good endurance. Gerza Kashmiri will be a great start in this match, but I think Hutchings will be great endurance and wins. Yeah, yes. They are asking me why I give you a hard time. I don't give you a hard time. I just kind of think that
SPEAKER_04: like it is very, very hard to, uh, I mean, you may win against Matt, but if you are like 78, 80%, as you said, like, it is not so easy, like being 20% of your best and, uh, uh, beating Matt. So that is why I'm thinking that like, you need to be like in very good shape. You know, that's why I was thinking, I'm not trying to give part time, but I'm just,
SPEAKER_03: trying to share my opinion, you know, I like Prudnik. I hope on my technique and my experience. Yeah, not power? With my power, 85%. 85%, okay, I understand, yeah. And Evgeny, do you think that Zurab has any chance against John?
SPEAKER_03: The rapper lose rest also. John has big experience, more experience. And I think John wins. John wins. John wins.
SPEAKER_04: you know drop matt the guy that you know pulled rambets yeah yeah so yeah how do you see their match i see i see john just too much too much control too much smarts too much pronation so his ability to be able to take someone's wrist and then transition over top of his arm and not lose any pressure throughout is like no one else right so yeah yeah that's true but john somehow
SPEAKER_04: it doesn't always see the things how people see from the outside he was worried that you know like not so much worried i should say but he's concerned that you know the run couldn't uh finish him you know sideways and
SPEAKER_02: I kind of think that Ron was a little bit too open, you understand? I think if Ron was more in behind his arm, I think it would have been a little different because then Ron could have gotten in to a better pressing position once he had him opened up more, right? And I think for loose wrist with John Brzenk, that loose fight. That loose fight.
SPEAKER_04: And Zurab, I think... Say again, sorry. I think who loses wrist with John Prezant, that loses all fights. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, I understand. So if John takes the wrist, it is not really possible to beat him with a dead wrist. So John will do something and press him. Yeah, I understand what you're saying. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: John doesn't open up. He doesn't like get as like John's good at staying tight into a good position, being able to defend from every angle, right? So. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So if we go to do another match, Gennady versus Dave Chaffee. Evgeny, what do you think?
SPEAKER_03: I saw them match in 2018 maybe, and Gennady lose 6-0. But I saw match with Michael Todd, him.
SPEAKER_03: Gennady Kevkinia very very stay more power has many power now and I think this very great much like yes wait understand yeah I think the same because level yes his level
SPEAKER_04: Close. Close level. Yeah, I agree with you. Kennedy Kennedy, at that time still was competing, like WAF events. And now he is totally unprofessional. I think he is now much stronger. This is what I believe. And I we just saw Dave also in Dubai, he was very good against Alex Kurdesha. But Dave also lost a little bit risk if Dave and
SPEAKER_04: Gennady ends up in similar position. I think Gennady will resist my opinion more than last time he did, you know, when they pull in Zloty super match. This is my opinion. I think that it will not be an easy match. This is what I am thinking, but I may be wrong. Many people use the edge to Dave. And Matt, you're probably thinking the same about Dave. I'm thinking Dave, but if Gennady...
SPEAKER_02: at all throughout the match I feel if he can feel anything or he gets even a little something on Dave I think the momentum that that man gets behind him when he does feel like he has a chance yeah is like that's that's where it's going to get interesting if if Dave can go in there and completely dominate him
SPEAKER_02: then I think Gennady's going to lose 3-0. But I think if Dave goes in and Gennady feels something or stalls him out at all throughout the match and feels like he has another angle that he can go on, I think that's when it's going to get interesting because he can fucking turn it on. When he turns it on, he's on, right? So you are saying that Gennady needs to have close
SPEAKER_04: strength level of Dave to use his skills. Or at least find a little bit of a hole. If he can feel a little bit of a hole in there, then yeah, then all of a sudden Gennady just got 20% stronger, right? Yeah. I think that the reason that Dave, we can say that comfortably beat Alex, because Alex is the guy that, you know,
SPEAKER_04: usually dominates the hand of his opponent. And this time he kind of took Dave's hand, but he also lost his own wrist. So I don't think that Alex has such a horsepower when he doesn't have the full hand control while Gennady can still fight, you know, even losing a little bit wrist.
SPEAKER_04: if he also takes the opponent's wrist in a in a in a similar position that they ended up round one ready go and where they might stop if gennady can gain a position like this he is not going to give up that easily you know he is he has more horsepower than alex but probably less less hand and wrist this this is how i see but we will see
SPEAKER_03: I think Dave Chaffee wins Kordache right techniques. He uses the right techniques and Kordache can't do anything. Only right techniques. Maybe his power is the same.
SPEAKER_03: same maybe his power is same but right techniques um and he wins condition i understand i understand so so like who do you think is gonna win for sure like like what's your opinion they wins or gennady wins you think or very close with him
SPEAKER_03: Dave with Gennady Kupinia. Yeah, 50-50, you say, basically? 50-50, yeah, because Gennady write techniques too. He has a big experience. Yeah, I understand. And Dave Chaffee, very big experience, and Gennady too. I understand, yeah, okay. A couple of superchats. Pawan, thank you. Pawan Sharma for your superchat.
SPEAKER_04: you guys touch on Devon versus Hermes. And what do you think shortly if you answer this? About what? Like Devon or they are asking Devon wins or the Hermes wins? Devon with him? Yeah, with Hermes. Yeah. Gasparini? Yeah. Oh, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: i think maybe devon because he uh till uh uh lever arm very killer arm and gasparini lose kurdecha because kurdecha has very level arm till he can't beat till our arms i understand i understand yeah and matt
SPEAKER_02: I say I say Devin just because where he is right now in the form that he's in getting ready for LeBron, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And and yeah, Devin's got a sticky point kind of close to the pad where when you're going for that top role and you're over there, the amount of strain that it puts on your wrist is immense. And if Hermes loses his wrist, he's one of those guys where
SPEAKER_02: if he's here he's a beast if he's here it's a different story and I think he would have enough to wear his wrist out and then it would be game over switch right over to Devin I think I think he'd have him on the Brinks for the first little bit but it would turn pretty quick after that yeah Hermes is about like more than 10 kilo heavier than the time that you have felt him
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, 290 pounds or something like that? He's about 285 or something right now. Yeah, like what the fuck is that? Yeah, so, but that one, as you said, is also getting bigger, so maybe Hermes is also getting stronger as well, or?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well, I'm sure he is, right? But the two of them carry it completely different, right? You look at him, you don't think he's 290 pounds, but he's got a lot down below, right? He's got a lot shorter torso, so like longer torso, shorter legs. So you say that, you know, because Devin is such a tall guy, like weight gain more favors on
SPEAKER_02: him not only not only because he's taller longer leverage but because he has a sticky point where unless you're able to jump in on top of it it's your wrist is going backwards right no i'm talking about the weight gain you know weight gain usually like for example like
SPEAKER_02: Well, I would say I would say Devin's probably out about five to 7% body fat right now. And I would say Hermes is probably sitting more around that 17% body fat. Yeah, that's true. Yes, I saw him. You know what I mean? Like, you know, he'll giggle a little bit before you you get into it, right? Ahmed brought attention to secular superstition. We want you both 100% on the table.
SPEAKER_04: He says that he wants you guys to be 100% at the table, Ermes, Evgeny. But it's not always possible. There are sometimes situations that you may not be 100%. But I mean, you do your best. You can be 12 months a year, 100%. But I kind of believe that you will be minimum 90%, Evgeny,
SPEAKER_04: East versus West event. I don't understand the question. Repeat, please. It wasn't a question, but they want you and Matt to be 100% when you go to the table. Why 100%? And with him? Yeah. With him? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: like this fans fans want you to be at your best not not 80 85 this is what they say it's it's okay it's okay man it's okay uh there one more super chat usually thank you when will we see hermes versus chaffee uh let them pull yeah maybe this summer maybe
SPEAKER_04: in dubai maybe in istanbul you know i mean i will try to set as many matches as uh possible you know and um other match marcio barbosa versus uh kiddo do you know on their way of match a little bit yeah this is this is the guy that that's the guy that was low hand top rolling yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this is the guy that
SPEAKER_04: probably was last guy that slipped from the hand of Levan in a super match. Yeah, maybe his hand is smaller. Maybe he's smart enough to, you know, how to do it. The last one, last one was... No chalk. Vaseline, rubbing Vaseline on your hand for a month and a half prior. Yeah, yeah. This guy beat Kurdesha.
SPEAKER_04: uh at top eight yeah yeah and he i think one round he beat you one round or two rounds yeah two rounds win uh two rounds lose and four rounds win so he beat you two two rounds right yeah yeah yeah okay i think the first round he toppled you and then you hook yeah
SPEAKER_04: uh top roll my first round uh uh i go top roll and lose my wrist yeah yeah and then you hook him yeah i remember yeah and and this guy is going to pull marcio barboza uh matt and but this guy some months ago had some the surgery surgery i think this is what i heard shoulder surgery and i think about two months ago he lost against a kazakh guy
SPEAKER_04: I think he hook him and beat him, but it was like a tough match. I don't know if he ended up beating him or he beat him once. I didn't really see everything, but one round I saw him beating him, maybe two rounds, I don't know. But he said that eye contact with the world champion, another Kazakh guy, Mazgan Shamir. He said that he will be ready. And this match will be under like a limit of 242 pounds.
SPEAKER_04: 110 kilo and barbosa and him like i i know that you you you guys are coming as west to this side and but do you like what do you think about like
SPEAKER_02: uh you wouldn't want to comment the only thing i can go off of like i've never gripped up with the other man uh i've gripped up with marcio a few times and marcio looks just as big just as strong as ever and looks like he's been injury free for a while and just for the fact that last time he was going to come up
SPEAKER_02: and he ended up having to cancel it because of covid and everything else i think marcio's hungry and urgent for a big match because it's been so long since he's had some major competition on the table so i think uh i think marcio right now personally is just a ticking time bomb ready to go off and i'd hate to be the next man that's gripping up with them so
SPEAKER_02: yeah so and coming off of an injury i don't know maybe in his top form it might have been a more interesting match but uh i think i think marcio is going to be steamrolling in this time so yeah yeah and what do you guys hello hello pradeep welcome you you you tried to come i accepted and then you were gone again i don't know what happened
SPEAKER_00: I was literally, sorry, I was literally sitting at this computer trying to figure it out. I don't want to join from my mobile because the audio and video is really bad. So I was just struggling with Zoom for more than one hour. Hopefully we still have 10, 15 minutes remaining. Anyways, what do you think, Evgeny, between the match Barbosa and Ungarbaev? It's dependent what form Ungarbaev has now.
SPEAKER_03: If he is in the top eight, I think he wins. But so far, I don't see Angerbayev. Did you see his matches from the Kazakhstan events?
SPEAKER_04: two months ago or something or one and a half months ago on that way i've had some matches in kazakhstan about like one and a half months ago months ago i don't know you didn't see i don't i didn't see yeah um pretty i i read all the super chats you you can check there okay if something comes you tell me pretty you there
SPEAKER_00: Yes, sure. Actually, I had one question for Matt. So, Matt, you recently faced Tim Bresnan. And if you know that Evgeny Prudnik was also supposed to face Tim Bresnan a few months ago. If you were aware of that match, what would have...
SPEAKER_00: been your prediction about that match like how do you see that match going if it would have happened the same day as your own match i know it can be a tricky question because if you say that you think prudnik would have beaten him it would kind of look like if you think prudnik is better than you or stronger than you so you can answer i'll answer it honestly and it's like completely different styles
SPEAKER_02: Right. Completely different. I pull completely different than Prudnik does. My strengths are completely different where his are compared to mine. So it would have been obviously a completely different match altogether. But I want to see I honestly, if I would have been putting money on it, I probably would have been betting Prudnik would have won it for probably five to one would have been my bet. So, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: but but how about how about if you would bet uh just think that you are not mad mask and then now imagine the mad mask will that will come to istanbul about five weeks later about 260. and then you're gonna bet between tim bresnan and the dead mad mask honestly
SPEAKER_02: Well, if I would have been betting, like if that Matt Mask was throwing a Paul Tim, knowing what he knows now, obviously it would have been a 6-0 Matt, I'm thinking, right? You mean even now? But to Paul, yeah, to Paul Evgeny, it would have been, I don't know if I would have been betting that match just because I've seen some of his previous matches where he did struggle and knowing where match strengths are,
SPEAKER_04: i could i'd be seeing it as this could be an interesting match and i could go either way depending on who gets what so i think the setup is going to determine a lot of of what happens so no no what what what i was asking that the shape that you were gonna show up in istanbul five weeks later and if if that shape that you're planning to be would face tim bresnan
SPEAKER_02: uh do you think that you you for sure would win yeah of course i do yeah i think i think i personally think i can win at the shape i'm at right now so i think i should have won three days ago but you know it was sometimes you gotta make a few mistakes before you get something right you know so just just met uh in istanbul
SPEAKER_04: know we will also bring some international referees i talk with them about like uh not calling the microphones or something but uh like as you know that like i would i don't know how to say i don't want to use the wrong word but suggest you to like
SPEAKER_04: like as a friend to like control your nerves and don't lose any match on just, just, just follows my friend, you know, just seriously, because. Yeah. No, no, no. If they're like refugees or something, we will just make sure that, you know, the Atlas are going to pull, but you know, we, we, we, we need the happens repeatedly. Right. No, no, no. I would, I would hate to, I would hate to, you know, just,
SPEAKER_04: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Like that that match is not going to start before represent go just like I mean so just I would want you to like like show. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Your skills, you know at the table, you know, without making as many mistakes, you know just i'm not criticizing you it's not my place you're a great athlete I would hate to see that you know just like. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, You can be percent sure everything will be.
SPEAKER_04: pair and square, some international referees are also coming, you know, I talk with them and then like I explain, you know, how the professional armistice should be, you know, no microphone calls, no, I mean, if referee is gripped, the guy is just a little bit moving, no need, just tell him that, you know, just don't fucking move, you know, you know, and then make your say, yeah, and then make sure that like, referees are not there to punish the athletes,
SPEAKER_04: in my perfect world puppies are there to help help outlets to make sure that they are muscle and show who is better but of course if one athlete just is just so stubborn then then of course there will be fouls you know as well you know so um so if we go to some a few other matches before michael todd and michael todd and uh revas uh luther you know you know there was huh evgeny
SPEAKER_03: no you don't know there was lucid ah let's eat there i know you know and what do you think about him michael todd um i think michael todd wins i don't know it's a very big power has very big power but michael todd uh
SPEAKER_04: uncomfortable uncomfortable uncomfortable uncomfortable yes yes yes yes so being strong is not enough to beat michael you need to know how to beat him as well huh
SPEAKER_03: um i think i know um has um slowly uh wrist yeah slab weak weak wrist has weak wrist oh okay and uh this go very good for uh michael todd uh-huh
SPEAKER_03: Okay. There is no chance that Lutidze can take Michael's wrist? I think chance... Lutidze has chance. Has chance. But small, small chance. Okay, I understand. And do you know Lutidze, Matt? Have you seen his match with Levan from the past draft?
SPEAKER_04: uh who's that saban what's that what's his name his name is revaz lucid about he's about uh same build as you heavier heavier he's probably 300 and something pounds 310 or something but his height is about same as yours uh but in the past you know in 2018 he and levan had very good match at waf
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Okay. I think, yeah, I think I know who you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. I just, I don't think, uh, I don't know. Yeah. If he can get the route, like it takes not just a strong, but a technical arm wrestler, I believe someone very technical in all aspects of the game, the belt to beat Michael Todd, just because of what he does. Right. Yeah. So, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: yeah i would say i would say by the end of the first round he's sitting at about 40 and then michael will just take him over from here uh look it's uh from georgia and i think uh gennady will talk uh like uh wins yeah he will he will teach him how to be yeah i think uh yeah
SPEAKER_00: So again, I, I interviewed rewards.
SPEAKER_00: I interviewed Rewaz. He's from Georgia Met and he's about 6'6", about 320 pounds. And I think it was 2016 VEF. He was the only one who in that tournament was able to take Levan's wrist and give him a 10, 15, 20 second match. And Levan had this first match war. It was Levan's first match, I think. And it was a war, 15, 20 second match. And he defeated Rewaz in that match, but he still ended up winning that VEF tournament.
SPEAKER_04: So Rivas took a lot out of Levan, but still Levan ended up winning and all of the other matches were easier than the Rivas-Lutidze match for Levan. Yeah, but it cannot be the first match because in WAF rules, two guys from the same country. Maybe in the beginning, first two or three matches. I think I watched the interview. He said like the third match or something. He said, I think that's what I remember. But in the same event, Arif Ertem and Gyorgyi,
SPEAKER_04: Shetko also had a very, very long work, much longer than this one. So the other athletes were not so fresh either, you know, but there is one super chat. One all depends on how long he can hold on to that stamina, too. Right. So, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that you need a belt to carry a lot of gas in your tank to.
SPEAKER_04: take out michael todd right yes yes yeah if you don't know you know how it is i mean if you cannot find the right key you you can open the door if you don't have the key to open i mean it's very very hard to beat michael i think you really need to know what to do to to beat him that the question is this guy is strong but i don't know if he if he is dead you know if he has that key or not you know but it looks very hard because the match just said
SPEAKER_04: like what, one month ago? And then I don't know if because we know that Gennady has been talking about how to beat that kind of move for some years already. So he already had game plan for a long time. But I don't know if Revas ever planned to beat Michael or pull him. So in two months, I don't know if he can gain those skills. And Revas doesn't look like someone who is as well rounded as
SPEAKER_04: So we will see. The guy is big. The guy is strong. If he cannot dominate Michael, which is not that easy because even Pushkar had some hard time to do that. And I don't know if it's up to Michael's shape, but I saw Michael training with Derek. Michael looked good. I don't know if you saw those videos of Michael, but I don't know which shape Derek was.
SPEAKER_04: uh but michael looked uh impressive there there is one super chat uh predip is itching with questions thank you for super chats freddy you were gonna read you were gonna read these questions you yeah
SPEAKER_00: I don't see good, you know. You should do it. About the same match, when I asked Rewaz on my interview, like his countryman, Gennady recently defeated Michael. So is he planning on taking some tips from him? And is he going to practice with him? He told me that he practiced with Michael that very day. That same day he practiced with Michael. And I think he's regularly, sorry, with Gennady. I think he's regularly practicing with Gennady to train for that Michael Todd match. Because they don't put those videos.
SPEAKER_04: we only see iraqli and rewa's training together yeah yeah these guys are very dangerous they are all training together yeah and then yeah because they are all strong i don't know we will see so uh how about uh evgeny uh you know samusha david samusha yeah yeah david samusha and you know pauline
SPEAKER_04: Samusha will rest with him? With Paul, yeah. Paul, American guy, Paul Lin. Paul Lee? Yeah, Paul Lee is the guy that gave some tough match to John Brzezinski in the book. And recently, Paul Lin beat Rambet in a super match. Uh-huh. Yeah. You don't know him? No, no.
SPEAKER_03: i don't remember maybe if i if you uh give me a photo picture i saw him i can see him face trying to do something freddie can you put the video but it will be hard yeah no the the one is pauline the other one is john brzing
SPEAKER_04: I think that's Todd Hutchins, no? Pradeep, were you able to watch the program from the beginning? What? I talked with Pradeep, but... Sorry, I lost the...
SPEAKER_04: i i lost the connection for last five seconds can you repeat the question please yeah um did you like have you been able to like um watching the program from the beginning yes yes i was literally i was watching the whole program right oh okay okay yeah so yeah okay and and if i ask the same thing to matt about what he thinks about samusha and pauline and the math is gonna say probably he doesn't know samusha
SPEAKER_04: Like, as Evgeny doesn't know Pauline. That is the reason that I'm organizing these events. Because now, if I was actually... Is Chance making it for that one, or... Say again? Is he making it for that one, or... I thought he was going to... Um...
SPEAKER_04: What did you ask again? Sorry. I think wins Samusha because I know him. So the reason I'm organizing this event, because if three months ago, if I would ask Matt, what does he think about Zurab? He would say, I don't know Zurab. And so what I'm just saying that after this event, like, uh,
SPEAKER_04: West will know who Samusha is and East will know who Pauline is. So that is good that, you know, everyone sees the guys whom they know to pull in with the guys that they don't know. So that is how we are going to unite the armwrestling this way. So Samusha, Pauline, you don't know about... Say, Evgeny? I think something bad connection is with me or...
SPEAKER_03: They. We lost your audio. Can you repeat again? And after fights, we will know they. Yes, yes, yes. Evgeny, what do you think about Krasimir versus Arif? Krasimir with who? Arif.
SPEAKER_04: Arif. Arif Erten. Yeah. Arif who fights with Hermes Gasparini last competition. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Arif is the last world champion, world champion in the super heavyweight. Yeah. That is Arif Erten.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Arif Ertem, yes. I think wins Bulgarian, Simir. They pulled till now three times and Arif won all three times for now.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. No, no. In the past they pulled, but we don't know what's going to happen this time. But in the past they pulled three times before. And Matt, do you know these guys?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Yeah. I know who Krazy is and Arif. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know. I think I think it could be a good match either way. I'm not sure. I'm up in the air on that one myself. So. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know. I don't know what kind of shape Arif is in. I know Krazy is always training, but. Yeah. So.
SPEAKER_04: I think if it goes inside, it's Krazy. If it goes outside, it's Erev. Yeah, they try to go inside. One will try to go inside. The other one will try the side pressure with the pronation control. And Matt, what do you think about this? If you beat Prudnik, Prudnik in some people's rankings, Prudnik is in top 10.
SPEAKER_04: and when when uh if you beat him like you should be ranking ahead of him in such case do you think that team and direct should be ranked ahead of you as well or do you think that you know it should be considered different time you know and then important is like when
SPEAKER_04: Derek beat Tim where Tim was ranked and when Tim beat you where you and him were ranked and now we're talking about a match after your match like one and a half month later it will be so that do you think that you beating Prudnik should
SPEAKER_04: rank them ahead of you or do you think that it is totally different time, different day? I think what will happen is if I beat Prudnik, I'm going to go up about one or two in the rankings and Prudnik is going to drop about 12.
SPEAKER_04: Same thing. If I was to have beaten Tim, I wouldn't have gotten Tim's 13th spot. Tim would have came over to me somewhere in the 20 range, right? I think different. Like, I think that if you beat Brudnick, you take his spot. Important is when the match happened, where the athletes were ranked. To me, in my judgment, is that way. That is what I think.
SPEAKER_02: I think once I get up to where I want to be for top form and the weight I want to get myself up to eventually when I get there, I see myself as being top 10 in that top 10 list in the world. So without a doubt. So it's just a matter of when I get there and how long it may take. And again, what's your top 10 or top five?
SPEAKER_04: world ranking, in your opinion? Evgeny, you there? Repeat, please. What is your, like, top five world rankings? Who is number one? Levan? Levan, Laletin,
SPEAKER_03: Devon Larratt, Prudnik, Ermes Gasparini. Listen, listen, listen, listen. You ranked yourself above Ermes? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, in Istanbul, when we chat,
SPEAKER_04: you were saying that he was a little bit better than you. And now you are 70%, but you started ranking above him? Yeah, when I 100%, I will be first. Okay, okay. But in Istanbul, you said you were 100%, but you said that Ermes was a little bit above you. So you really think that you should be ranked above Ermes? You think that you are above Ermes? I think...
SPEAKER_03: I can do it. Yeah? Wow. So you can also beat Dave Chaffee? I? Me? Yeah. I don't know. I take him hand so far in 2000
SPEAKER_04: 14 and i can't do it um is is it the only only his connection is bad or for you too yeah yeah yeah yeah do you hear me are you gonna now yeah yeah okay so what i'm just saying that basically
SPEAKER_04: do you have a dream to be in really like pulling those super heavyweight guys and beating them? Like Dave, like Devon, Hermes, you plan to beat them? Yeah. Yeah, you do? Wow, that's good. Yeah, because in Istanbul, East versus West event, I want to do categories like 110 kilo and heavy.
SPEAKER_04: You are at the middle. So I want you to just compete 110 and sometimes super heavyweight. Now you pull super heavyweight match against Morozov. You beat him. And now your next match is Matt Mask is also super heavyweight. I think Matt, if you want it, really want it, you can also make 242s, right? Easy.
SPEAKER_04: Easy, yeah. So, yeah, I mean... I'm one group away from 242 pounds right now, so... Yeah, so what I'm just saying that we should also set you matches with those guys as well, you know? We should set you with Irakli, for example. I think you versus Irakli would be incredible match as well. Yeah? I think that you should also pull down and up if you want it. It's up to you. Yeah. Let's worry about Prudnik first. Yeah, yeah. Prudnik is...
SPEAKER_04: probably, probably the number one guy, uh, as of now under two 42s. Yeah. I mean, I'm just guessing, but he, he, he will pull, uh, in August with, uh, um, touchings, touchings. Yeah. Uh, what did was the weight limit you guys agreed? 107, right? Or 107, 108 or something. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: 107. Yeah. Do you see any superchats? Nope.
SPEAKER_00: I have one question for Matt. Matt, you were mentioning a few moments ago something about top 10. So you have had countless opportunities against Devon Lett, who has been continuously in the top five for nearly a decade, I would say. More than a decade, maybe. So you came very close, but you were not able to beat him. Have you had any other opportunities in your career where you went against a top 10 guy, like where you can defeat a top 10 guy and get into the top 10 officially?
SPEAKER_02: Well, Hermes was in there, wasn't he? Yeah. Like, that was most recently, I'd say. Devin, Hermes and Prodnik is also ranked top 10 by most of, almost everyone. So, this could be your third opponent who you have a chance against to get in the top 10. Third time's a charm, eh? Maybe third time's a charm. Yeah, when you pull Hermes, like,
SPEAKER_04: You said that he was in top 10, but I am not sure about that. I think Hermes is recently in top 10. This is what I believe. Because before that, who did he beat to be top 10, Pradeep?
SPEAKER_00: i think again if i remember the rankings correctly at that time or maybe after the match in istanbul against matt maybe after ermis won that match he was ranked eighth in the world this is what i remember okay that one because i wasn't even in the top 10 right
SPEAKER_02: But he jumped ahead of me when he did a practice pull with Vitaly and pulled Vitaly over. All of a sudden, he jumped about eight in the fucking ranking. And then he beats me, and I wasn't even in the top ten, and all of a sudden he jumped a couple more spots, right? So, yeah. It was because also people were really inactive.
SPEAKER_04: many of the people were not COVID. That's just it. COVID, it's hard to tell how it affected everybody at the time, work-wise, where people's mental states were. It's going to be another year or two, I believe. All this is settled before we start getting everybody back to where they belong, right? I will tell you something. You're right. We need another year to know exactly where people are ranked.
SPEAKER_04: But of course, still opinions will matter. People will say that this guy beat that guy, this guy beat this guy. In that way, I judge the recent match. But I will tell you something. In one year, we will have a world ranking that will be better than ever.
SPEAKER_04: Because now a lot of people from East and West are getting opportunity to pull each other. And now we really have, before it was like a lot of guests. Two or three a year maybe, you know. Was there?
SPEAKER_04: you'd have like two or three matches a year where you'd have East versus the West. Yes. Yeah. Now we will be doing in, in King of the table there. And in Istanbul, if you realize I'm like setting more than 10 matches, so we will be knowing more and more exactly, you know, where, where people are ranked. And then, I mean, I think, do you think that it is also becoming a motivation for the Atlas this way? Or is it, is it like discouraging to,
SPEAKER_02: bring the East and West together. I think it's great. I think it's great because how many how many matches have you seen already where the Westerner guys have already pulled each other? You just got to keep recycling them, right? Yes. So it's like these are matches that everybody's been wondering about for the last five, ten years, right? Yeah. So it just opens up it opens up a whole different
SPEAKER_04: whole different playing field right so yeah matches that ones were only able to dream about are actually starting to come true now so yeah yeah yeah yeah all right so eugenie uh you want to add anything you want to say anything about all these things that we are talking repeat please like do you want to say something about these subjects uh
SPEAKER_00: uh good luck mask is is that all youtube youtube that's all that's all good luck in the beginning there were some questions for prudnik whether he wants to start a youtube channel or not and about his english prudnik i would like to ask you
SPEAKER_00: about something about english can you read english because if you can read english then it could be really easy for you to learn because you could just create a youtube channel you need to talk a little bit slower okay okay sorry sorry can you read english can you can you also read
SPEAKER_04: read now yeah yeah i can i can read write and speak english yeah yeah so whenever whenever whenever whenever uh in the east versus west conference uh people had uh paper front of them and pen and he wrote a lot of things in english i saw his paper ah yeah
SPEAKER_03: okay I read Shakespeare I read other writer you know so I think Brodnick you should just start a YouTube channel SMS and SMS on confirmation okay yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: So Prudnik, if you can just start a YouTube channel and go live like we are going live right now and people will ask questions and you can just read and answer that will be really great for your English. He says that you should start YouTube channel. Slowly. Slowly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because our armwrestling world needs people like you. You are very, I don't know,
SPEAKER_04: entertaining guy both at the table and outside of the table you're very smart guy very talented guy just a little bit more english and then like you will be a great addition to arm wrestling world this is what i believe yeah another question i will have a provocative question for you with a good preparation can you beat devon yeah yeah i hope yeah
SPEAKER_04: uh i um i want it you want to pull him right yeah and and the question is how do you see yourself beating him in which technique do you think you can beat him you know his technique open arm top roll how do you beat him with a hook you think you can hook him or you can top roll him how do you think that you can beat him i take uh him uh pronation
SPEAKER_03: I take him pronation. Or I can take him rest, rising, rising, rising. I understand. I forgot the name of this technique. I think it's... Open hand.
SPEAKER_04: your your internet connection is a little bit little bit like um you get in prison so we don't understand everything do you understand pretty everything or also gets cuts with you as well i think he was saying that he can do what devon did to michael in 2011 if it comes to that point he can just climb over his hand if he's going down yeah that's all i got as well yeah
SPEAKER_00: I kind of feel like Matt is thinking just first beat me and then you can, you know. I actually wanted to come to that point, Matt. I have a question for you. Like, I'm not sure even if you know how big of an armwrestling personality you are. I watched your video.
SPEAKER_00: where you were talking about the announcement of devon versus levan and that video has like 130 000 subscribers like you just come on youtube and maybe in terms of views you may be the third fourth most popular arm wrestler in the world like you get crazy views crazy popularity so naturally peep people take a lot of
SPEAKER_00: pride in what you have said quoting your words like your words mean a lot to us fans so i've got two opinions one from you and one from devon i interviewed devon recently less than a month ago i would say and devon said that he still has a lot of trouble dealing with your hand in round one since 2014 or 15 you became so much tough for him that he has trouble dealing with your hand at least for one round but you on the contrary side you said that
SPEAKER_00: if Devon tried to go hard against you, you would have had nothing for him in the recent practice. So is it mutual respect from both of you or who is telling us the better version of truth? Like, are you difficult for Devon? But you said no, Devon could have taken you easy if you wanted to. So who should we trust out of the two of you? Depends on where we're going, right? Like I can, at the center of the table,
SPEAKER_02: I can control, but he's got his sticky points and everything else. Yeah, like in at practice, it's practice, right? Like it's not it's not about like if you notice when if you watch any of our practice pool sessions where there was 50 people in the room, every single person that went to the table, all they wanted to do was beat Devin, right? It's not about that. It wasn't about that for me when Devin came up. It was more about
SPEAKER_04: getting Devin ready for the Vaughn. So it was at that point when he was chipper down. Yeah, I could have beat him probably fairly easy, but it wasn't about that. It was about getting him beat down even more. But in that process, I start getting tired. Right. And then that's when he's able to capitalize and let him go from there. So but it's I don't know, like he he has a hard time dealing a bit with my pronation.
SPEAKER_04: at the beginning of the match right at the start but right around here is where the pronation doesn't really matter to him anymore right so so what what what what what matters there what's that
SPEAKER_04: You said that your pronation doesn't matter there. What matters there? The angle that he's pulling at, it just, your pronation just dissipates. Okay. It's a complete talk block for your pronation. So if you get him over and you got your wrist, and as soon as you get close to that pad, the angle that he's pulling at, the closer you get to the pad, the more pressure starts applying on your wrist. So what, my question is, what you need at that point? More wrist?
SPEAKER_04: need a press oh you need press yeah so there is there is no there is no wrist that can control that that uh tornado at that sticky point well maybe there is but it ain't my wrist
SPEAKER_00: so when i i made a video about it and i discussed this topic like even on day one i think there is a misconception from what i got on your youtube channel i think it was the first day when you two were practicing and you two were the only guys in the room
SPEAKER_00: i think day one you practiced fresh for fresh and at that time i said that matt still looked fresh for fresh at least for a couple of polls good against devon and people were saying that it is devil like people always tell like it is devon he always gives everything in practices so you cannot take anything anybody that says that anybody i'll stop you for a second anybody that says
SPEAKER_02: It's practice. Devin lets you get everything you want at a practice table, has never pulled at a practice table with Devin Lorette.
SPEAKER_04: So even in the reason why he's so good at what he does and gets what he wants in a setup when he pulls in a big high tournament or a super match is because when he's out of practice, he does the same fucking thing. He's always fighting, right?
SPEAKER_04: So, and it's usually when he lets you get everything is when you're really fucking tired. Right. But that's, that's why he's so good at it. Right. It's because he does it over and over and over again with 150 people a night. Right.
SPEAKER_00: So this is what I was replying in the comments. Like I got a dozen comments saying that it is just practice. Devon is just preparing, letting him work. This is why the practice pulls between Matt and Devon are looking close. Otherwise, it won't be close. And my reply is, have you ever seen a Devon versus Matt match? They always look close, even during real competitions. Like when was the last time when Devon completely dominated you? Round one has always been close. And this is what people forget. They say that this time...
SPEAKER_04: the practice is looking close just because it is practice. No, it isn't. Their matches always look close. This is my opinion. It's just the angle that I pull him at. I got a little bit of a kryptonite for Devin, but not the full package. You know what I mean? And it's like where it just, he's a little vulnerable in where I attack him, but there's a little more tools I need to be able to finish it.
SPEAKER_04: kind of deal and it's and it's and it's it's practice right like it's when me and Devin get out of practice we're not trying to kill each other right like there's there's probably some times where I could have pinned Devin but I'm not going to because it's not about that when we're practicing together and there's times where he's probably could have done the same thing to me but it wasn't about that right so
SPEAKER_04: But it's, I can tell you right now compared to like when we would grip up before, like if you seen us on the floating dock in the water out at my cottage, I was controlling him a lot more and it wasn't until I'd get really close to the pad to where I'd struggle a lot more with him.
SPEAKER_04: Now it's, he's not here. It's here is where you start to struggle with him, right? Like even when he'd pull a whole bunch of other people in practices, he'd always be pulling out here. He'd always be pulling out here. It's not till about 40 minutes into practice or day four or five where he starts to get open. He's a lot, he's a lot tighter, right?
SPEAKER_04: so so you are saying that he is stronger at the center he's way stronger in this than he has been in probably the last seven years my god honest opinion he is like his hand is fatter everything is a lot harder to deal with like
SPEAKER_04: And fresh for fresh, like, had we had went at it, like, fully went at it, I don't think I would have been able to get Devin's arm as close to the pad as I have in the past when we've trained. Like, it was – he's a different human being now. So, like, he is. Like, my chances of beating him right now in the position he's in and the state I'm in is, honest to God, like, zero to 1%.
SPEAKER_04: so and not being realistic just for how he's actually feeling like it's not human you know what i mean um brady are you missing super chat yeah yeah there i was about to read it a two dollar super chat from proving astrology was asking how much do you think travel affects the matches
SPEAKER_02: I think you should ask this to Matt. And Matt, you have had one of the worst experiences in traveling last time you documented it. Maybe close to Ryan SP, but definitely one of the worst. I say it definitely affects. If you're on a 15 plus hour flight within two days, it's definitely going to affect you. But myself, for this match, it's not going to make a difference. I plan on showing up
SPEAKER_04: about six days before the event. So I'll be climatized, the jet lag would be gone, everything else. But yeah, definitely anything over a two hour time change, it definitely plays with you a bit, but the longer the time change, the longer it's going to affect you.
SPEAKER_00: And again, there is one more super chat about the rules. So GB19 with the $2 Canadian super chat. East versus West won poll for the best match rules. He's asking that as a question. So I think he's talking about a poll that I created on my channel yesterday. So I created two polls. Which rules do you like the most? WL, PAL, King of the Table, East versus West. And in the next poll, because I forgot to add Armwars, WAF, PL, Top 8. So I added them. And surprisingly...
SPEAKER_00: East versus West in the first poll was number two. WL people said that they like WL rules more. 50% people voted for WL. But when I added arm wars to the poll, 36% said that they like arm wars rules. East versus West, 14%. And WL again, 28%. So very close to the top. So there has been a lot of discussion about the rules and people are saying that they like WL rules, which are one of the most loose rules out there.
SPEAKER_04: I understand. I understand. So, I mean, it depends, you know, it depends on where you ask the questions. I mean, if you just go, uh, ask us to do like pure arm masters or people, you know, like you may get the different.
SPEAKER_04: uh answers where do you ask the questions yeah i'm sure if you ask it in your question east versus west rules wl will be probably at the lowest but my poll also got about 3 000 votes so that is a good number yeah yeah i mean it depends you know who is who is voting you know it totally depends you know every every organization may have their own uh uh fans but you know anyway so i think prudnik is gone and so maybe um
SPEAKER_04: You want to add anything, Matt? Good luck, Prudnik. You just sent me the tickets, right? From the... Yeah, I sent you the tickets today. Yeah, yeah, the details, yeah, yeah. And you coming on what, 16th? Yeah, I'll be getting in on the Monday. Yeah, 16th, you coming? So you coming, you arriving there five days before the event? I think that there will not be any traveling issues. No. Five days, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: no unless it takes me four days to get there like it did for me to get home yeah i think the last time you had the bigger problem when you are returning right now when you are coming you coming problem but not as much as it was it wasn't as bad it was only about a six hour delay but okay yeah the way home was about a 36 hour delay
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah, yeah. Because, I mean, during the pandemic... This will actually be my third time in Turkey. Oh, yeah, because you went to Europe and come back, right? Yeah, then they flew my ass back. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I had some questions for Bruno, but I don't know, something, maybe his connection is gone. I will ask you very shortly.
SPEAKER_04: If I do, like, as I said, you know, the title matches for the belt, East versus West title matches, and if there is 242 limit, and when you think there is Hutchings, there is Brzing, there is, like, there is, like, Irakli, Ongarbaev, Barbosa, yourself, you know, and Krasimir, who do you think that, you know, would be, or style makes matches, that there will be different results for the different matches?
SPEAKER_04: and Prudik will also be there. Like, how do you see there? They would be very interesting there. How would I see myself or how would I see it all go down? I mean, generally, generally, how you see yourself, how, okay, Evgeny came here. I want to ask him the same question as well. Like, how do you see that? Because it looks, I mean, very, very interesting there. Whenever you see Tatashin's there,
SPEAKER_04: when John Bersink is 110, Irakli is there, Ungarbaev, Krasimir, yourself can make it, Brittany can make it, Barboza can make it, he's under 10. So like, how do you see that, like, who do you think that, like, have the more chance to get such a title? Or style mix matches? Who would have the biggest threat? Who would be the biggest threat? I mean, for you, man.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I would say Evgeny would be one of the biggest threats in there for sure, right? Yeah, and maybe Hutchins as well? Hutchins would be hard work for a few guys. I think someone like Prudnik would give Hutchins a lot more trouble than some of us other guys, right?
SPEAKER_04: just his ability, just his ability to belt to pull in more than one angle on the table and transition from one, one position to the other. I've seen him go from a top roll to a hook to a top roll back into a hook before multiple times. Right. So like during one match, so, so, and then John, if John's weighing in at,
SPEAKER_04: 250 pounds and cuts to 240 pounds like he's that's a bad john bersink right how do you see him and hutchings how do i see him in hutchins i see john at 240 cutting a tube 240 250 cutting a 242 i would say john just because of just just with the hand control that he's able to manipulate right so
SPEAKER_00: yeah there is one super chat hanging seven dollar canadian super chat from teasing coder who picked that picture of matt for this poster himself himself he sent me yeah i i took it my daughter took it and we sent it in is there a problem with it or what
SPEAKER_00: i don't know he has he has posted a smiley emoji under that comment and fortunately the guy who edited these thumbnails they did a little hair in a can on top of it yeah so the guy who edited these posters he's also in the chat solar and he's saying hello legend engin pradeep and matt yeah how's it going buddy
SPEAKER_04: Okay, okay. Now I will ask you, Brutnik, Brutnik, we're going to make title matches. 110 kilo, we're finishing the program, but 110 kilo limit. You hear me? You there, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So how, if you would ranking, if you would do one, two, three, four, five ranking for 110 kilo, like John, Todd Hutchings, Ongarbaev, Marcio Barbosa,
SPEAKER_04: matt mask and iraqli yourself you know how do you see number one number two number three like what do you think in 110 kilo yeah 110 kilo with these guys who do you think how kilo now two he's 110 kilo now
SPEAKER_03: He's 110 kilos now. But he will be 117-118 when he comes to Istanbul for you. But now 110. And who first in this people in 110 kilos, yeah? Yeah, yeah. Your opinion, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: uh repeat please uh people john brzenka matt mask uh todd hutchins yourself uh i think uh final uh me with john brzenk how how is that in the world final
SPEAKER_04: How do you see yourself now, right now in the world, number four and then 110 kilo and below, you and John Brzezinski is like this? I don't think John Brzezinski is right now number four. He can be number 10, but I mean in 10, but number four, not easy. Do you think John can be Dave Chaffin here? I think in weight 110. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Number of first number. It's john berserk. Or me. Okay. Okay. And after on goodbye. And dot Hutchins. And after Matt mask. And after Barbosa.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, not Irakli, huh? Irakli is a little bit lower. Irakli two. Irakli two. Okay, Irakli after Ongarbaev and Agha. I understand, I understand. I think, you know, what would be a great match? The great match would be if Ongarbaev is 100% healthy. Ongarbaev and Tata Sings would be, I think, incredible match.
SPEAKER_03: I think Andrabayev wins because he has a very good start and top role. And Andrabayev has a bad start. He can catch him. I understand. Anyways, so I took so much time from you guys. And thank you very, very much. Matt, do you want to say the last thing? Oh, you want to say something, Pradeep?
SPEAKER_00: yeah there is one super chat a similar question have been answered but le loach britannia with a six malaysian ringgit super chat who do you think is a stronger devon or hermes uh they already answered my opinion in waffles hermes has better chance in the king of the table rules uh that one may have the better chance in my opinion it depends on you know like
SPEAKER_04: rules a little bit how the match starts how quick it starts because whenever you pull with devon i mean every second you go down 100 98 96 94 and he goes 100 99 and a half 99 98 and a half isn't it matt isn't it
SPEAKER_04: he's just sucking sucking your energy you know just he's just like i don't even not i'm not even sure if he's going 199 and a half maybe he's going 100 and 100 and a half and 101 i don't know it feels like that sometimes yeah yeah you you feel like you feel like you are fighting against the weight huh gravity that never gets tired because you hold the weight you get tired right i think that you know from what i saw when people push devon
SPEAKER_04: That is how they feel. Pulling against something that is not getting tired. This is how it looks from outside. But Matt would know much better than I do because he pulled him probably thousands of times, including with the trainings.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, no, he just doesn't, he doesn't peter out. He hits, he'll get to about 70, 80% and then he'll just kind of stay there. So like you could, if you get him down to that 70, 80% and then you get somebody that is really good, then they can peter him down to about that 50, 60. But as soon as he steps away from the table, 30 seconds later, he bounces right back up to 70% again.
SPEAKER_04: How does it happen? I don't understand. His body's ability to just shed lactic acid is absolutely insane. I think, again, that some of that can come from his military training days. Because if you're only running, like arm wrestlers are not known for jogging or running. Because if you're only running for 20 kilometers... Even before Devin's military thing, Devin was just...
SPEAKER_04: a straight out anomaly for the endurance that he had yeah yeah i i don't think i don't think that he was just one of them people like that point zero zero five percent of the population that just has natural crazy ability like he could have been a triathlon athlete and competed with the best of the best in the world right yes like yeah right off the street so the point i mean i was trying to say is that
SPEAKER_00: Say it, say it. Please, please let me complete. So the point that I was trying to say that when you're just running 20 kilometers, it is only training your stamina and not much of endurance. But when you are running 20 kilometers in military boots twice, thrice a week with 20 kg backpack and a 5 kg rifle, that can somewhat translate into endurance. Because it is also in the military, it is called endurance workout. Those kind of trainings like helps you as long as you train that way.
SPEAKER_04: it doesn't give you a lifelong you know permanent you know endurance like it it can't be explained like like you're saying that the guy is built different that that is the fact i i've talked to people i've talked to people that have actually been in the military and then when they were doing their training sessions with devin
SPEAKER_04: And when they do their workouts where they beat the shit out of them for four weeks straight, like some of the guys with the best stamina in the world and these big military guys, they'd be done. And they're in the room, icing, licking their wounds and Devon's in the corner still doing fucking pushups.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. I mean, just because he was who he was, like I've heard where the military actually did tests on Devin to see how and why he was able to continue to do what he was able to do because he was able to do it so much longer than everybody else. And what can they take away from him and put into somebody else to make them do the same thing? Right. So.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Yeah. Like it's, it's not just because of the military training. It's he's the military training obviously brought a lot more of it out, but just all in all, he's just an anomaly. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I, before, before we finish, I will ask very provocative question, uh, to Evgeny. Evgeny, do you remember that you, you turned to Morozov? You said Morozov, you are not at my level. Uh,
SPEAKER_04: Do you think the same about the match? I don't think, I don't know. I hope this is true. I hope. You hope that he's not at your level? Yeah, yeah. I just tried to provocate, you know, the event, you know. Okay, we are finishing. Do you want to say anything, Evgeny?
SPEAKER_04: i talked about uh that matt mask matt mask good luck good luck yeah thank you you're gonna probably wish him the best as well yeah starting starting yeah yeah
SPEAKER_04: And you don't want to hear any words if he ever loses, you know, like he was 80% or something like that. Well, that's what I'm already starting to hear, right? You're already looking for him. He's just pulling him out of anywhere, right? Evgeny, like you say you are 70%. Are you trying to make an excuse if you lose him?
SPEAKER_04: And you're going to say, oh, I was 70%. I was 80%. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. People actually, I didn't read those comments. People are saying in the comments that Prudnik is just trolling with all three of us. No, he's not trolling. When I asked him to pull Morozov, he really told me he's in great shape. I said, like, are you as good as your shape? You were in top eight. He was like, yes, I'm 100%.
SPEAKER_04: But this time he says he's not. But I think that maybe he's afraid of Matt. Yeah, he just like makes, you know, story. If he loses Matt, he's going to say, oh, he beat me, but because I didn't train, because I was 80%. Is that true, Evgeny? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: he is trolling i think yeah i wanted to provocate him hard but okay guys thank you very very much i took a long time from uh your day and hope to see you in istanbul and just bring best of you and just wish you the best with your uh preparation if you want to add anything more you can add if not that we are closing oh just thanks again for the opportunity man we'll see you soon
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, see you very soon. And then, hey, I will also, I may need to come with you where you are going to go when you come to Istanbul. Who, me? See, look at here. Yeah. Oh, I know. I've been looking at it. I may need your help. You just got to stand like this, right? Nobody can really fucking tell. Yeah. Especially when you are
SPEAKER_04: Like that tall, like 6'5 are you? 6'7 or 6'6? 6'5, 6'6, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So many people doesn't realize as long as you are not sitting there. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, see you in Istanbul, guys. See you in Istanbul. Yeah, you bet. I can hook you up. I'll hook you up. Evgeny, you take care of yourself. Evgeny, show us some forearm. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Looks dangerous, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: okay okay see you in istanbul my friend take care
