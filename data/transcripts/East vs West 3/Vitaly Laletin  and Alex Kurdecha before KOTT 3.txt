SPEAKER_01: What is Engin doing? I don't know. Engin, where are you? I'm just connected to the YouTube. Okay. You already have some party here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Already started. Yes. War of top rollers. Exactly. Yeah. Alex, can you hold my phone upside down?
SPEAKER_02: So how are you guys? Very cool. But now I see only you and myself. Vitaly goes out now. I don't know why.
SPEAKER_02: just just uh pull the page to the side you see that the bottom there there are uh three of the dots you need to go to the right side i don't know because now i see you and me but not uh vitaly like previous oh perfect but did you did you now now it's cool yeah yeah yeah i i yeah that's good yeah
SPEAKER_02: Vitaly, you see all three of us, right? No, I only see you. Only me? Look, there are dots, you need to move them, and there will be three screens. You see, there are such dots, you move them, and three screens appear.
SPEAKER_02: Say hello to Engin.
SPEAKER_01: Hello Vitaly, how are you? Good? Good, good. Good, yes, good to see you. So the translator is probably gonna be here very soon. I wouldn't want Alex to translate for you. And so let's start from somewhere. In my opinion, you guys are number two and number three in the world. And that's my opinion. And you guys will have a super match
SPEAKER_01: and Dubai very, very soon, probably a month left. And the whole world is waiting for this. And looks like winner of this match will take the winner of the Devon Larratt versus Vitaly Levan Saginashvili match in June, you know. And let's start with you, Alex.
SPEAKER_01: like do you do you agree that you know it is going to be mostly depending on the the wrist handling you know you both are very strong with the top roll and back pressure and then you know when you both loaded the one whose wrist survives then is gonna take and the one that is i mean it is gonna be like you know all the battle will take at the like right at the center
SPEAKER_02: when the girl comes like i don't see you cooking uh vitale i don't see him doing anything else to you so it will be mostly about it it will be a huge surprise if we start with the hook and the goals with six rounds only in the hook i think nobody expect this and also we are so first of all uh say hello to everybody uh it's really cool and uh absolutely agree with ending that uh
SPEAKER_02: all will be depends like it will be like a fencing not it will be like a fight on you know big swords it will be fencing like uh like engine says on the wrist so on the central position also uh it gives a lot if you some of us want the wrist position yeah i'm absolutely agree with this and can you wanna me translate to italy or you have already
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I mean, I don't have it. He didn't enter. He said he's gonna download the zoom and join us. I sent him the link already, but he still didn't join. Sorry about it. But just can you try to translate?
SPEAKER_02: He thinks it's cool that you're number two now. At least number two, or maybe even number one. And that the guys put me third, although I'm with this. I say thank you for that, but I think it's too much of an advance. And he says that the interest of our fight will be that we will fight there. And then the winner of our fight will fight the winner Devon Sahinashvili.
SPEAKER_02: And the one who loses will fight with the one who lost. For example, if the winner of our pair fights with the winner of the other pair, the loser of the other pair will fight with the loser of the other pair. Interesting events are planned. And Engin also says that
SPEAKER_02: He thinks that a lot will depend on the wrist, on the fight with the wrist, not so much with the hands, not so much with everything else. He says that it will be a big surprise if we start fighting with the hook. Yes, I agree with you, more precisely with Engin. Yes, I agree that the wrist will play a big role.
SPEAKER_02: okay and you know vitalis agree with your or with your things with your socks you know but he says he read it to the hook and i catch him by the word i catch him by the word in this moment yeah after i saw him going inside with uh
SPEAKER_01: Krasimir and then when I saw that you were like like a helpful with uh Hermes so I'm just thinking that even it is not your primary move but you guys are working on and for different options as well you know this is what I'm thinking yeah and it's good it's good I I wouldn't want you guys to be I mean you guys are so powerful you are at the top
SPEAKER_01: I think you need to work on different, different ways as well as you guys are doing, especially you improved a lot since like before the pandemic, you know, you were just like loading back and now you go inside where you want to help where you improve a lot of
SPEAKER_02: your side still you are going mostly outside but but you are uh supporting with uh uh side pressure it's incredible you know incredible it's true it's true i'm agree with you but you know like i respect vitality very much he spent more than 15 or maybe 20 i now ask him how how many years he's in arm wrestling yeah so he working on technique
SPEAKER_02: like a master. He worked years by years to go where he is now. Almost 20 years from 2001. Almost 20 years. That's why I say that
SPEAKER_02: For example, Vitaly finished his master's degree, PhD degree, and now he's a professor of techniques and everything. So I respect this. And I know that, for example, for myself, I'm on the bachelor degree. I'm at the beginning. So I'm ready to work on myself and work not only a few years like, okay, the pandemic gives me this possibility.
SPEAKER_02: but if i need to be uh after this match smarter faster more durable and more technician i will i will do this so like for me it's cool i think that italy is favorite no and this gives me uh more power because i don't think about or what will be after the match i think and like what what it gives to me
SPEAKER_01: so that's why i think i'm in a better position but vitale is favored yeah but people people doesn't see it that way people sees that you know like either way it can go including myself
SPEAKER_01: and you said that vitality is like master of the techniques but i think vitality is like super good about his technique about the other techniques i don't think that he had to try because for many years he pulled in a category weight like 85 kilo 90 kilo 100 110 kilo and there he had some very strong hook opponents
SPEAKER_01: and then for that limited weight class it was not possible him to do anything with them you know against because he's so tall 85 kilo 90 kilo is just too small for his uh you know real size you know what i mean for his height yeah so yeah so so there was no way him to beat krasimir in his weight so he perfected
SPEAKER_01: you know outside outside outside and whenever now i think that whenever he gets really strong and then come into his near near full capacity you know uh then um then now he's i think more brave enough to try you know even inside that and that because not many people can do anything to him you know right now this is what i will yeah do we have already translator guy who can say this yeah
SPEAKER_01: He came and again he's out. I don't know where he is. We need him already. There is one question for you from Travis Baginashvili. From Travis Baginashvili? Baginashvili, you know, those fake accounts. Yes, probably, yes. He says, is it true that Alex has a PhD?
SPEAKER_02: PhD, if so, can you tell us about it? Yeah, guys, it's true. I start my working with the titles which I worked before and studied before. I'm studying in the faculty of aeronautical systems. So I'm working with aircraft incidents investigation and the role of the human factor in.
SPEAKER_02: uh and after that i'm continuing the work in the phd degree on the same title so yeah it's true and after that i'm even work in poland you know we have some like sometimes accidents happens but after that i'm going to the direction of car accidents so now i'm in department or with card accidents
SPEAKER_01: Can you, is it possible, because the guy, I think, has technical problems, very, very sorry, but can you ask him, you know, like, how does he see his chances? But, I mean, honestly, you know, no need to be nice to each other here, just tell us as fans would like to hear, you know. Yeah, yeah, I will translate, but we definitely need the translator.
SPEAKER_04: Vitaly, a fan asks, how are you going to win all the rounds? What technique will you use? What are you going to do? What's your plan? I've always done what I know how to do. That's the first thing. If it doesn't work out anymore, I'll be thinking about something. I won't take anything new. I won't act on my own fear and risk.
SPEAKER_04: I will do it the way I know how to do it. That's how I always did it. So it all depends on the situation, whether it works or not. Engin, are you here? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you hear me? Hear you, but only picture of you. Yeah, yeah, because I'm... With your big biceps, you know. Reach the translator, you know. Yeah, how to do it? Yeah, what does it say?
SPEAKER_02: uh he say that uh he will plan uh to use the uh methods which he's used before always because always the methods works so the starting plan like this and if something will not work properly he will change the plan during the game but the starting plan is do what he always doing yeah yeah um i have a question you know um
SPEAKER_01: usually because he is so you know tall and his forearm is also same so he usually uses the the the the front which is you know dropping here and then pulling that way and he pulled it almost the same way with with uh levan and then whenever levan rised up you know so
SPEAKER_01: it didn't really work for him his style is super super good for the hook pullers you know it's it's i think on this road nobody can hook vitale but right now he's gonna pull with someone almost the same height as himself and like
SPEAKER_01: does he think that you know to to to pull with the the low hand top roll i know he doesn't have to i know he doesn't have to uh answer that but you know i mean does he think that because do you know why i'm asking this question because he said that to you now he's translated he's going to go in the same way that he does always so to me you know i mean you you know my point yeah i know i know but we need translator it will be much if we have somebody
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah that is what i try to do when you ask me you know if i am here because i don't know how to stay here on video in the same time just call him and ask him to enjoy to our party
SPEAKER_01: Now he will call the translator. Okay, okay. He said that in a few minutes he will be home and he will join us because he couldn't from the phone. I think he will go from the computer. Yeah, but we can wait for a few minutes to get this answer. Okay, go ahead. So, Vitaly, Engin wants to ask, this is his personal question to you.
SPEAKER_02: It turns out that he does not see anyone in the world who could beat you in the hook, because you have a specific technique, you fight with a broken wrist, with a flag, so-called, and it's hard to get there, because it turns out that you pull your fingers very hard, you give a load, and those who try to twist you in the hook, in principle, it is almost impossible to do it, or it is very difficult to do it. And analyzing your fights in smaller weight categories,
SPEAKER_02: Engin says that there were moments when you used to fight Krasimir, but now you can see how much difference you had in your last fights. It turns out that the question he had was that, as a rule, if a person with a short arm, with a shorter forearm than you, it turns out that you fought more with a broken wrist, with a stick.
SPEAKER_04: Are you going to start with a flat hand now or with a stick? I'm going to start with a stick against the person who tries to get into my hook.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, this is a proven option. In the last few years, when I fought Krasimir, I started using it. It helped me. You saw it yourself. When we had a Smart Fight in Bulgaria, he couldn't twist me. In the first four fights, I won with this technique. I also fought Evgeny Prudnik. And I'm also ready to fight any athlete who wants to twist me. But I won't give it to him.
SPEAKER_02: So, Engin, the answer of Vitaly
SPEAKER_02: that he always uh use this technique with the flag position of the wrist with the guys with shorter forearm but with the guys uh who like don't try to hook him to not go inside uh he don't need to use only this technique so this technique is the guys for the guys with shorter forearm for the hookers if he goes with somebody he also try to climb to rise
SPEAKER_04: Not only by... Yeah, but am I wrong that against Levan he still was like this? Do I remember wrong? I will answer. I will answer. I will answer. I will answer. I will answer. I will answer. I will answer. I will answer. I will answer. I will answer. I will answer. I will answer.
SPEAKER_02: In the first round with Levan Vitaly tried these things but now he's already find that it was wrong decision because it was better position to Levan. He was Levan goes to the hook but Levan also goes to the rise upper position and top row and he Levan takes the better position than Vitaly and it makes
SPEAKER_01: or like hard to to won the first round and after that it was has some impact of on other rounds oh okay i understand yeah yeah that's why i said that whenever he tried the first round i remember he was like this he was still pulling and then levan was rising up and then he said well even going more down you know that that's why i said um there is a super chat by bt do you both expect to overtake levan in near future
SPEAKER_02: Do you expect to beat and take his spot? Of course. Of course, yes. I will ask Vitaly. He asks, are you going to beat Levan and how much time do you need?
SPEAKER_04: You know, I don't get tired of it. Everyone says, you can't beat Levan in this form. I don't write about it anywhere and I don't say anything that I'm going to concentrate on this. I'm going forward with my road. And as soon as there is an opportunity, it will definitely happen. And we'll see if we can do it or not.
SPEAKER_02: The answer of Vitaly is that he works on himself and tries to be a better version of himself. He doesn't concentrate on just a bit of Lebanon, not just think only on this. Of course, he wants to be such a better version, to be better than everybody, but he doesn't concentrate only on this.
SPEAKER_02: The same about me, the same about me, about myself. Like I said at the beginning, for example, for me, the guys like Vitaly and Levan, it's guys who works on their selves a lot. Maybe they are not like professional in everything, but they are professional.
SPEAKER_02: in their own technique. They work on their arms, on their hands and find the effective way. So the same I'm doing now, I see that, for example, if I'm working on some aspects, I will be better on these aspects. But first of all, I need to understand which aspects are more important during the fight and how to be a better version of yourself. For me, it's like now I'm in the opening of this.
SPEAKER_01: And for example, for Italy and also Levan, I think they already opened this and just like work about small details in these things. Yeah, I agree. I agree. But, you know, except how to say Levan, everyone else looks beatable. And Levan also looks beatable.
SPEAKER_01: But I think they really need to work on it, you know, in a, like how to say, someone needs to a little bit worry about him, you understand? Like, yeah, yeah, this is what I am thinking. I think my friend, his name is Murat Varhan. He has been second place in European Championships to Cerkasov. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: yeah he's probably already connected just need to connect the voice yeah yeah yeah the camera camera i think he needs the camera and the microphone i think he needs to turn on yeah yeah so um can you can you ask vitaly's uh uh top five arm master in the world right now without in like like including himself without including
SPEAKER_02: Vitalik, Engin asks you to create 5 best armessers now, the current strongest, and not necessarily include yourself, because the guys have already included you. That is, if you didn't include yourself, then 5 in order of the strongest, as you think. In order, first of all,
SPEAKER_02: Okay. He will name only these guys with whom he already pulled. Oh, but he will not have any opinion about them? Oh, hello. So now we have the translator. Ask the translator to ask again.
SPEAKER_01: I will ask like can you Murat, can you Murat, can you tell him to say the first five in the world? But he doesn't just have to say the races. Let's see and have an idea. I haven't raced with anyone. But I have an idea. Tell him that. Not just the races. Ask the first five in the world, for yourself.
SPEAKER_00: Hello, Vitaly. Can you tell us your opinion about the top five athletes in your opinion?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, I will answer like this. I am now ready to name about five. Of all the people I fought with, this is, of course, Levan in the first place. Next, Dmitry Silaev is now in very good shape. Brutnik, Gasparini are also very good, strong athletes. This is what concerns the right hand. Well, in fifth place, I think that
SPEAKER_04: Engi, Na'Vi.
SPEAKER_00: You understood the order, right? No, I didn't. Now, Levan Saginashvili. You can explain in English. Levan Saginashvili on the first place. The second place is... It was...
SPEAKER_00: The second place is Dmitry Silayev and third place is Ermes Gasparini. The fourth place is Evgeny Prudnik and on the fifth place is Dmitry Trubin. Oh, Dmitry Trubin. Okay, I understand. He says this because
SPEAKER_04: These are the only ones that he really either compete and train, right? That's why. He asks, in your opinion, is it you with whom you competed or do you train? Well, with Dmitry I train and I know how strong he is now. And with the rest of the guys, I just performed and I felt everyone's hand. That is, by strength, it was hard for me.
SPEAKER_01: uh with dmitry's life uh his training uh what about another guy say he competed with uh them and uh he made this reason yeah okay i understand you and uh and alex your your we we had an interview with you before uh but has your uh top five uh change since then if you would no no the same like like before like i said
SPEAKER_02: uh like if something changed in the nearest future it will be maybe has some impact of my top maybe now like i say that for example hermes i will put him more upper than for example michael todd but in previous interview i already has like they both was on the same place just now hermes higher you know can you remind us again first is levan and second is vitaly and third is
SPEAKER_02: Your sound is gone, yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So I will repeat, the first is Levan, second is Vitaly, third is Devon, fourth is Ermes, and number five will be, previously it was Michael, but now... Now Gennady Bidim. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just think who will be on the five.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe Dave, I think it will be Dave and Gennady. So I put them both on the same place because I'm not sure who are stronger. Yeah, but according to which result of Dave, you'll move them up? You remember in previous my interview, I already put all of them like Devon, Michael and Dave.
SPEAKER_02: I put them in the top because I don't say like top five, but in the position. So in the first position is Levan, his second is definitely Vitaly. And after that, it was two guys on the same position. So Michael was on the five positions with Hermes and Dave was on the fourth positions with, I don't remember, with probably even with Devin. Yeah. Or maybe, you know, Devin was third. With Hermes was fourth.
SPEAKER_01: So, I mean, I don't want to make these rankings. I just want to put some guys in the system of five. Because, for example, now I don't know who's stronger, Dave or Gennady. When we asked Vitaly before Murat came about his chances versus you, probably he didn't mention about that, right? He will do his way or something, but he didn't say anything, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah so i was just curious if you missed me missed that answer or or not and uh can you ask him murat uh his opinion about about devon versus uh levan in the percentage uh uh
SPEAKER_04: I'm not mad at Devon. I'm friends with him. I think Levon is 10% stronger than Devon. In our sport, 10% is a lot. So we'll see how Devon will prepare. But as of today, it looks like this.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you. What about this competition, about these two guys? He said that 10% higher than Devon Larratt, what he sees now. But of course, it depends on Devon's preparation for this competition. So, we will see.
SPEAKER_00: So he said that Levan shans 10% more than Devan? Or he gives Devan 90% to Levan? Devan stronger on 10% now. Stronger than Levan. But he said 10% in our sport is a high amount. He says that Levan is stronger than Devan. Yes, Levan is stronger. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay, okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: 10%. Yeah, I understand. Yeah. So that way, if you explain, yeah, that is, yeah, 10% is so much. But about the winning percentage chances, it's something different. Yeah. And last time we talked, I think this match wasn't set, Alex. Yeah, yeah. The last time we talked, it was not confirmed. Now it's confirmed, but previously it was only like...
SPEAKER_02: thoughts about potential possibility of this match yeah and and and can we uh learn you know your opinion about it about our match or about devon no no no about devon and uh the one uh like i said before for me like uh levan is number one and uh he's like in the base level he has
SPEAKER_02: more potential than everyone to be favorite in every match with if somebody we he will pull with and i like for example like i said the devon is a guy who can do some miracle uh during the match he sometimes do something unexpected he like a professor of techniques he's very endurable
SPEAKER_02: He's unbelievable in the mind games. And I think that, for example, it's only in my opinion, only one way to win with Levan is to win with him by mind games. I think it's very, very hard to win with Levan only by power or only by set positions or only by some special trick of techniques.
SPEAKER_02: So I think you need to use everything to be stronger in your mind and to try to make him weaker. But it's also very, very hard. So for me, Levan is favourite of the match and it's very hard to beat him. The question is that when you say the mind games, you're talking about the pre-event or during the match?
SPEAKER_02: I'm talking about during the match, because if it's VAL rules, you can do a lot. You can do some falls, you can do some more possibilities on the setup positions. You can do... VAL rules...
SPEAKER_02: give more possibilities to the guys than streak for example waf groups and i mean that's for example uh when you uh pull by valve you can be sure it's a pin or not and uh in wal it can be pinned but with the fall it's uh like your opponent can fall like more times
SPEAKER_01: I think it's not WAL rules, but they have their own rules. I think King of the Table has their own rules. But it is, I think, similar, but there are some differences as far as I know. Do you think that Levan is mentally strong enough not to be manipulated or not?
SPEAKER_02: I think he's very strong mentally, but for example, if you ask me in our system, PAL, it's very hard to make any surprise for him. But maybe, and I repeat that only maybe, Devon prepares some surprise by new possibilities of new rules. Because for example, what I mean exactly, when Devon and John pull first round,
SPEAKER_02: I think the first round was very important. And for example, the way how Devon goes out with John and position, how he goes out from the straps, he has some impact on the wrist of John. But I think it will be not enough only this with Levon.
SPEAKER_01: I think it was something about the endurance more than mind games, I think. That is what I think. And does Vitaly think that any kind of mind games of Devon will affect Levan or not? Or would Vitaly get affected if he ever pulled Devon and if Devon
SPEAKER_00: played those kind of mental games. Vitaly, Inter is asking about whether Devon Larratt will be able to impose a mental fight on Levan during the fight or somehow morally push him, we can say, to influence him. No, Levan is a very strong person morally.
SPEAKER_00: He doesn't think so, that Levan can influence to
SPEAKER_00: levan make some mental games because he also strong mentally he think so so he will do what he planned to one move and he will win like in one move i understand yeah i understand and and can you also ask vitally
SPEAKER_01: how is his shape now and where his shape will be you know what's the like what does he think that his shape will be by the time that he's gonna pull alex like are we going to see a vitaly as good as krasimir or lower or higher than that shape uh
SPEAKER_00: Yes. He asks about your form before the fight with Kudlyach. What is your form? The form that was with Krasimir, or is it higher than this form? My form is much better now than it was in the summer, when I fought with Krasimir. I didn't really prepare, because there was very little time.
SPEAKER_00: His form is better than... Murat, can you speak Turkish for me? Okay. His form is better.
SPEAKER_00: I was preparing all this time, and I was gaining weight. I train non-stop since summer, and I always add different exercises.
SPEAKER_00: He says that his shape right now is much much better than the time that he pulled.
SPEAKER_01: uh versus uh krasimir he he said that the notice was short for that event he wasn't like super trained but he says that since that time summer he has been training regularly and his shape is uh much much much better than uh that time yeah it is it is
SPEAKER_01: it's just yeah it's scary to think after after what how he did with uh crossing and if he's saying that you know his shape is much much better you you can see that you know alex is just smiling there you know like you know
SPEAKER_01: a hard day waiting for him but for sure for also vitality it will be a hard day i mean this is incredible this is like you know like the top of the arm wrestling you know world and i mean i just can't wait to i mean watch it you know i i i mean incredible it will be on course sports and um guys um the the the on the eastern east versus west event the the technical issues uh
SPEAKER_01: did not uh happen because of course sports course sports were responsible to tell us the the technical things and since i'm very new about it i work with a company and they are good but they are not very experienced about the live broadcasting so the we are not going to make the same mistakes but the the whatever happened here as mistake was not the fault of course sports it was our mistake
SPEAKER_01: and i promise with it we will it will not happen again because we took our lesson and yeah the sound and the internet everything will be good you know next time so please uh watch this event there will be also sarah beckman versus gabriella there will be wagner bortolato earthquake versus uh hermes gasparini and there will be khalid versus larry wills it is gonna be a great great great event and
SPEAKER_01: I personally think to core sports. I think armwrestling had different, you know, eras, you know. And now, you know, we, after the pandemic, we came to a new era with this paper between with the core sports and Larry Wills and the other guys. They're doing great things. And Alex, what do you think about the last event, East versus West? How did you think? I think it was amazing.
SPEAKER_02: Especially, you know, every pair of guys was like stars. It was a lot of superstars in armwrestling. For me, it was like every match was interesting, but especially John and Haji Murad. John like shows that he's like the gold. He's already have everything and he's not going to the vacation. He's in the process.
SPEAKER_02: So big cheers for John. Also, it was, I think, unexpected for a lot of guys what Gennady did. He already shows to everybody what to do with King's move. I was in the minority, not majority, but minority guys was thinking that it can be like it was.
SPEAKER_02: Uh, and, uh, nothing to say to like Michael, huge respect for him because, you know, after this match, a lot of people, uh, doing say, starts to say that Michael is not something special, but I just think that Gennady make a cool homework to find the key, how to warn with Michael. And, uh, we need to remember that Michael, uh, has some tough matches with Andre Pushkar, with Denis Siplankov.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah people like to just like like i mean suddenly just make that guy like you know he is nothing here he has always been nothing just why yes like you know the guy has done great things maybe now he's not there maybe not because he's not there but the other guy passed him or something but no need to disrespect you know i understand that because i know michael he gave probably more than 30 years
SPEAKER_01: and he has been dreaming about you know to be like considered the very best and you know just i mean it is it is i think for me probably for you the same because we know what the price price we need to pay to reach the top
SPEAKER_02: exactly so whenever the guy is in a hard time you know it's a time to lift that guy up not not to push it you know more more more down and you know also very huge respect for michael how he takes the lose because winning is very easy when you won people love you say something cool about you but
SPEAKER_02: michael i also respect him uh after this match even more because he says it's not any excuses i just lose with better man so yeah like how he takes it you know yeah also for me was interesting the match of course hermes and if i know you support the reef and you know i support hermes so for me it was like um but just i don't want you to be misunderstood you know when you say support
SPEAKER_01: it is it is something from the heart but not not about the like technical things you know the referee on this on that they just yeah yeah of course that's their part yeah okay i mean that for example for me it was interesting the result of the match but for example i know
SPEAKER_02: a little bit more information about hermes that's why i'm like know what what uh people can expect from him and for me it was uh like uh i'm cheering him because we like uh talk a little bit more i know that arim is a beautiful nice person he has a buff title world title of world champion but now that hermes shows that his level like higher to compare to the buff yeah so yeah
SPEAKER_01: Not really? No, no, no, no, no, no. You're talking, you're comparing about two different conditions that we both know we don't want to go into there. Okay. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. You're talking, Arif this year will continue competing in WAF event. I understand what you mean. Okay, okay, so yeah.
SPEAKER_01: anyway so you know that people will be judging like this they always watch i know i know but the truth is it may be true but it needs to be proven you need to go to waf and do this there you understand in the conditions of the what i'm not saying anything more but like if you talk that way it will be unfair to irf as well so murad can you ask uh vitaly about what does he think about the uh
SPEAKER_00: About the last East vs. West event, did he enjoy it? Vitaly, what do you think about the last East vs. West event? What are your impressions? What's your opinion? It was a great tournament. We discussed it with Alex.
SPEAKER_04: Good fights. I liked Hermes Gasparini. He fought Arif. Good fight. It was interesting to watch Prudnik, Morozov, Artem. All the fights were very interesting. It took a long time to test these athletes and see the strongest. The idea was great. Yana.
SPEAKER_00: He liked the competition very much. It was a perfect competition. Plus, Arif Ertem and Ermes Gasparini had a good match. Evgeny Prudnik and Morozov had a good match. Interesting. Michael Todd was also...
SPEAKER_00: He says that basically he enjoyed very, very much the event.
SPEAKER_01: It was very interesting for him to see the matches, like Arif versus Ermes. He said Prydnik versus Morozov. And he said, which one? Gennady versus Michael Klotman, right? Yeah, yeah. By the way, I saw on the chat that Ermes is four times WAP champion. As far as I know, in the senior class, Ermes is only one time WAP champion.
SPEAKER_01: He won after the first place guy tested positive in Malaysia. But I think Hermes also won Zloty titles. Alex, did you see the new matches that are set already? Only a couple. You already set Dave with Gennady.
SPEAKER_02: i am i don't know what to say of course i know that they have like story about the uh it will be very much between gnadi and dave so it will be interesting match uh second match uh it will be iraqli and john yeah i'm right iraqli john and tatachins versus prudnik and then olexo versus dadikian okay so
SPEAKER_02: i think all the matches will be very interesting i need to say truth what i'm thinking about yes yes yes yes yes i think only brutnik and todd hutchins will be not interesting do you think that prudnik will dominate yeah i think he will beat very easy with it with top roll right or hook as well he will absolutely dominate with top roll and even uh for himself i think he because
SPEAKER_01: Brutnik is a smart guy. In round number four, or maybe upper round, he will be checking the hook also. Oh, yeah. But do you think he can also beat him in hook? Yeah. Wow. But, you know, sometimes we need to set the matches.
SPEAKER_01: i don't know if it will be like you say i i'm just thinking that if somehow it goes to strap match and i know that uh topzilla is training his pronator and if he somehow managed to go to strap and in this trap i don't know if it will be as easy as you are saying even with a top roll try but anything can happen but even if it happens some matches needs to be set
SPEAKER_02: no matter what the result will be, because we need to see, you know, we need to see. I agree with you about that. I just want to be correct. Yeah, I understand. I mean, this match, it's my expectations, but I will be happy if it goes another way. I will be happy to watch how it can be.
SPEAKER_02: uh just i'm based on the matches for example and uh prudnik versus thought on the moldova they both beat like uh in fast way so they know that even inside because evgeny won with uh tozilla inside uh by fast move so he know that probably he can use also this uh this way you know
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Let me check. It is because of my internet or your internet. It is... Yeah. Can you hear me? Yes. Oh, the connection is gone or... Murat, can you hear Engin now or not? Yes, I hear him.
SPEAKER_02: because for me he's only picture now i'm uh yes the picture is now it's move oh now it's okay yeah now it's okay yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah anyway so yeah but in the moldova event it was interesting that prudnik beat hutchings in same event hook and i think did he beat him once i'm not sure probably not i think that todd hutchins
SPEAKER_02: beat everyone in a hook who was not enough faster because babayev on the vendetta with hutchins was fast and beat him fast i remember that even uh hutchins beat probably sasho or maybe grasimir some of two guys i'm not sure but i think both of both of them yeah both of them because they don't go too fast and in the slow hook he was stronger yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: And what are your opinions about Gennady versus Dave and Irakli versus John and Dadikian versus Olek? Like if you just don't go detail, but just like, I mean, if you want, you can go detail as well, you know. For me, for example, Irakli and John, it's an interesting match because I expect that Irakli will try to pro John.
SPEAKER_02: And it will be showing the wrist conditions of John. Because, for example, John always was famous by his huge power in the wrist control. And for me, I think if Irakli doesn't open the wrist of John, it will be hard to beat him. I don't think that Irakli can beat him in a hook.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but you know, many times John versus Taras versus Denis Splenko, even he didn't have the wrist because he protected his pronator. He beat them this way too. So what I'm just saying that Irakli is very good with outside, you know, move, but his wrist and hand control is not as dominant as Prudnik.
SPEAKER_01: you know even when someone sometimes he beats the guys he beats like this even you saw with the daniel daniel mosher whenever he beat him his wrist was like this and he beat arthur macaro in his wrist at the end he was even bent back you know he had to press this way so i'm just thinking that john cannot hook him and it will be no he cannot
SPEAKER_01: yeah if he tries to do that i think iraq is going to beat him badly but if if john protects his pronator when it actually hits from there and if john also maintains the pronator
SPEAKER_01: if they are both in flat this position maybe with the side pressure john can beat him you know this is my opinion you know just also remember it's all times john sometimes starts not in this direction but here like uh start to just keep in better position sometimes yeah just to catch in hook but you know um uh it actually first goes he doesn't really go that way he just first positions
SPEAKER_01: and then and then goes you know if he was going direct is a pin you know it would be good that you know john would catch him but he first secures his position and and then goes for the pin and and what do you think about gennady versus uh
SPEAKER_02: uh dave uh it's really i think depends from the dave shape because also from the dave motivation if it will be like the same conditions of dave when he was pulled with dennis i mean old times i mean that if they will be in the prime shape of his possible shape
SPEAKER_02: uh i think i give more chance for dave but it really depends from the dave shame because gennady now extra motivated gennady now on the rising up position and gennady i think will try to improve all aspects of wrist and fingers how possible it will be for him and it will be i think the key
SPEAKER_02: uh for the dave uh i mean uh hand control positions and the wrist so if you feel it will be not prime shape of dave probably gennady can uh beat him but if they will be control the wrist of gennady like in previous vendetta yeah but at that time do you think that gennady was in his best shape do you believe that do you believe that gennady was as good as he is today at that time
SPEAKER_01: you mean the previous vendetta or now yeah yeah yeah because at that time you know it was just uh just was out of waft times you understand you know i i think right now he's like more like
SPEAKER_02: You know, difference. This is what I'm thinking. I think that Gennady is stronger compared to some period before, but I'm not sure, for example, that Gennady is the strongest version of himself. I believe that he can be better in July. Do you think that it's possible Gennady to be stronger in WAF?
SPEAKER_01: than outside of what shape i i kind of don't think i think i think outside of buff shape is so easier for canada to be strong no no i mean this is now he's stronger this is what i am saying that in the wealth you know you it's hard to be as strong as you know outside of you know everyone i just i just repeat clearly how it's possible
SPEAKER_01: I mean, for example, Gennady in July will be even stronger than now on the East. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. All I was saying that Gennady now is stronger than the Gennady pulled Dave. Because at those years, he was still pulling WAF events, you know, around those times. People understand us in not proper way when we all talk like that.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, come on, just everyone talks. I mean, Devon from morning to the evening talks about pancake. No, it's okay. Anyways, the last match, Oleg Zok versus Dadikyan with left arm.
SPEAKER_02: is very amazing and this will be the answer that Oleg come back with his best shape or not now in the start position I put them equal because I don't check that Oleg come back enough like he was or he's just coming back he's picking now I think also he's not come back with full power yeah
SPEAKER_01: and um okay one super chat okay i can read all the gmail who is the iphone guy iphone guy is vitaly lalatin yeah and can you ask vitally does he know about the upcoming matches
SPEAKER_00: of the next East vs. West and what does he think about them? Vitaly, do you know about the next East vs. West matches?
SPEAKER_04: No, I don't know. I've heard a little about it. I've heard from your conversation that Oleg Zhuk is going to fight David. Oleg Zhuk with David, yes. John Brzenk with Hercules. Yes, yes. And also Gennady... Yukina. Ah, Yukina with Dave Chaffee. Yes, yes. I haven't heard anything else yet. No one else.
SPEAKER_00: Who else did we miss? Well, I've only heard these pairs, and I haven't heard any other pairs. I think it will be told in the future. Engin, I heard about these three competitions with John Brzenk.
SPEAKER_00: Irakli, Gennadiy and Dave Chaffee. At the same time, Dadikyan and Oleg Zhokhin. And Prudnik and Tatachins. Yes, I forgot about Prudnik and Tatachins. Now we remember Prudnik and Tatachins. Yes, tell me that I only heard about these two. Only these four competitors,
SPEAKER_04: What are your predictions about these pairs? Well, in the pair Oleg Zhokh-Drikandey with David, I recently stood, very good, strong. I don't know how much Oleg could gain his form.
SPEAKER_04: I can't say anything about his previous fight. He needs an athlete like David to check him, to see if he can fight with his powerful left hand in the current conditions. David is in good shape, he's gaining weight.
SPEAKER_00: He has been playing with Davit lately. He says he is very strong right now. But I don't know if Oleg is in his old form. But he didn't show it to me in the last competition. But I say we will see in the match.
SPEAKER_01: okay he says that he says that uh he has pulled with dadikian lately he says he's very strong and and he says that you know if oleg can come to do his best shape you know then then you know the things changes but uh
SPEAKER_01: What he saw in the last event, he didn't think that Oleg is in his best yet, but till the event we will see, is what he says. Dear Masha'Allah Nadeev,
SPEAKER_04: Evgeny Prudnik vs Todd Hutchings. I think Evgeny Prudnik will be able to win. He is very strong in hook. I think he will be able to win. Evgeny Prudnik vs Todd Hutchings. Prudnik is in the hook position.
SPEAKER_01: okay he says that he says that um versus touching he says that it is you know um he thinks that uh maybe there would be some resistance in hook but he says that prudnik would beat hutchings even in hook uh you know other than top roll you know even in hook
SPEAKER_04: He beats him. And John Brzenko versus Irakli? Irakli is very strong at the moment. I look at him, I observe him. Very good performance. But John is a very good athlete, a very wise athlete who can prepare well, find his fighting technique.
SPEAKER_04: Just watching Irakli, how he fought Sasho at your tournament a year ago, right? And when he lost, Irakli seemed to be much more than Sasho, Sasho could have won. That is, with his indicators, which were less than Irakli. So let's see how it will look. I think that John will be able to complete his fight with Irakli, but Irakli will also simply not give up.
SPEAKER_00: According to the last competition, we saw that Irakli was strengthened. But it looked big when he did it with Sasho before, but unfortunately it was opposite to him in the competition. The thing here is related to John Brzenk. He finds a technique that works against him.
SPEAKER_00: And I believe that he can do something. Of course, Irakli will not be idle. He will show his reaction in a meeting. It will be a good meeting. He says that Irakli looks strong, especially in the last event. He is probably talking about the training pools.
SPEAKER_01: and but he said that he was looking great even before he pulls sasho but in the competition it didn't it didn't go that way and he said that you know uh john is very knowledgeable and he will find a way to pull against him but iraq will also do his thing and then it will be a good one but uh murad
SPEAKER_00: Can you remind him that Irakli that pulled Sasho was 90 kg, and Irakli that we saw in Istanbul, he was 105 kg? Irakli, who fought Sasho, was 90 kg, and here in Istanbul he was 105 kg at the last tournament.
SPEAKER_04: Well, yes, yes, I see that the athlete is gaining weight. What I see, I say it. Because lately I have not fought with anyone, I have not shown my form. Therefore, how to fight for the table can only be assumed. I guess what I see. Of course, he gained a lot of weight, gained weight, gained weight, gained weight.
SPEAKER_01: But of course, we can only guess, but it will be clear on the table. Yeah, he said he is only saying what he sees. And yeah, of course, he gets bigger and look very stronger. And we can only guess, but we will see what will happen at the table. And last one, Gennady versus Dave Vitale.
SPEAKER_04: It turns out that Gennady has a very good start, a very fast fight, and Dave has a slow fight. But I think that I will not offend Gennady, I will say that I think that Dave will be stronger than Gennady. Gennady can punch at the start and can fight with a broken brush. That is, as far as Dave is ready. But in the form in which he came to fight with Levan, I didn't like him. I think he will win.
SPEAKER_00: He is a very fast athlete, but Dave is strong against him.
SPEAKER_00: Even if he gets the command here, let's say if his wrist falls, we'll see what happens there. I mean, if he can do his form, if he can keep it higher like in the last game, I see Dave as a favorite here. But of course, if he can't do it, it would be an interesting match here. He says that Gennady is a quick guy.
SPEAKER_01: And while Dave is strong, and if Dave can, you know, reach to his best form, he sees Dave as the favorite one. And, but it says that, you know, at the end, you know, we will see, it's an interesting match. It says, Juju Mugur. Thank you for super chat. When are you going to see, when are we going to see Kurdesha in Hollywood?
SPEAKER_01: as as soon as hollywood invites you deja i'm ready to ask about hollywood yeah and jujube engine the trash talking needs to be in real time for uh east versus west three can you get translations translators in each person's headphones in to translate in real yeah we will do we will do a better one i mean we learned a lot from the from the last one

SPEAKER_01: There will be Wagner's The Earthquake versus Ermes Gasparini. Ermes Gasparini is a feature legend. You know, I have been, you know, saying this forever. And then, of course, the number two in the world versus number three in the world, in my opinion, there will be Vitaly Laletin versus Alex Kurdesha. Just don't miss it. Sport, the sport you love.
SPEAKER_01: And if you guys don't have any other questions, I don't want to keep this guy any longer. Probably they need to go train after they eat, take their protein, and then, yeah, get dressed, get bigger, get stronger. Do you guys have any last word to say with the community, you know, before we stop? Alex?
