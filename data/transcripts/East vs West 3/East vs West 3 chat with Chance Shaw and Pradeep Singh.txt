SPEAKER_02: My guest will be joining me very soon.
SPEAKER_01: and Pradeep. They will be joining. Hello Phil, how are you doing? Hello Andrea.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, guys. Very soon, my guest will join me. Probably in a few minutes. So we will be talking about East versus West, as you can guess.
SPEAKER_01: and we will talk about the matches. And this weekend, I don't want to do any live. I think it's the Easter. And they are coming very soon. I injured my lower back. I did some standing barbell curls and
SPEAKER_01: It's a chronic injury in my lower back as well, so. I have been laying down, but I. For now, sit. OK, chance just came and. Hello hello chances could see him. I can't hear you. Might have the wrong. Settings here.
SPEAKER_01: waiting for you and for sorry wrong speakers on now you hear me no yes I do oh you do okay so how are you I'm doing well how are you doing good good good you you did a good job you did great job I expected you to win but versus Todd I mean not many can do right now that but you gave him a
SPEAKER_01: very very very very hard time yeah thank you yeah i def i definitely wanted to win but um yeah you know i did my best so thank you yeah yeah yeah i mean you you pull very good you know it's it's just not possible to i mean not not many people um
SPEAKER_01: can do everything you know perfectly i think you did very very well but maybe a little bit more but i'm sure that you know you you learn something and right now next time if you pull him you would you would just probably do you think that you were not uh ready technically or it was all about the strength i i feel i did everything
SPEAKER_04: that i planned to do like i executed my game plan i did what i i uh needed to i just wasn't strong enough to to take his pronator like of course i can take the risk but i was trying to get him palm up yeah yeah i just i just didn't have enough yeah i realized that once you try to do that then then you start losing your own pronators i think the key is to do that both at same time i think
SPEAKER_01: yeah i was trying i just didn't have the the strength necessary i think so you did your your game plan uh i mean good but you said you executed but uh do you really think that you were able to do as you plan everything um
SPEAKER_04: I wasn't able to do what I planned because I wasn't able to take his pronator, of course, but I was able to try. I executed in the way that I feel I didn't make too many mistakes on my game plan. I just had to...
SPEAKER_04: be stronger so I could execute it properly. Of course, the mistakes I made, you know, there were some elbow fouls. If I kept my elbow down, of course, that would have been better. Or my finger slipped off the peg and that was called when I felt I was in a good position. So it sticks in that way. But what I was trying to accomplish, I think. I mean, I never school except by shaking hand like we never even like train with Todd. But I kind of think that
SPEAKER_01: one needs to have um some serious side pressure to at least match his side pressure to keep the match at least here to not to be going so much this way i mean i'm not saying that one should be touching with side pressure versus side pressure but even to apply to be able to apply what you plan
SPEAKER_04: you need some side pressure support. Am I wrong or? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. The biggest thing, I mean, one of the biggest things for me, I was trying to, like you said, match side pressure to keep his hand out of his shoulder. It's a lot harder for him to set a wedge with his hand outside of his shoulder. When his hand is all the way here and he has a side pressure engage, he can set that wedge a lot easier. So if I had more side pressure and I could keep him here, then I'm a lot more in the game, I think.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, one guy is asking who felt stronger, John or Todd. But I think that, you know, before I ask you this, everything is different from that time to this time. I mean, you are stronger than that time. And also, John, it was the beginning match. I'm sure that right now he's much stronger. At that time, he looked like, you know, he's just like,
SPEAKER_01: I don't know because he was many years away. I don't think that he was like ready mentally, the hand control and everything. So, but I am sure that you are also much stronger than that time.
SPEAKER_04: right now? Yeah. I mean, it's, it's a hard question to answer because like you said, I'm way stronger than I was before. Um, but also John is, is much more in shape than he was when I arm wrestled him. So, um, I think today I could beat the version of John that I had originally back in July. Um, but I still, I don't think that I'm capable of beating today's version of John. So, um, you know, it's hard. I think that John's a bit more capable than I am when it comes to,
SPEAKER_04: controlling the pronator and the hand and wrist at the same time. So I do think that John has the tools necessary to beat Todd. You think that right now if they would pull Todd? I think John would beat Todd right now. But it's only speculation, of course, because the distance of time that I pulled them is too far apart.
SPEAKER_04: I'm not sure if it's my internet or your internet. You're cutting out a little for me. Is it my side? Yeah. Maybe, maybe. I don't know. I see I'll be frozen, but maybe I use my own internet. I think my internet should be fine.
SPEAKER_04: hello do you hear me yes now i now i hear you yeah yeah i wasn't able to hear you before yeah yeah emir where's pradeep you know he came and he left again or what happened um i i haven't seen pretty pop up on my screen so i'm not sure if he tried to join or
SPEAKER_01: yeah i saw him i accepted him bottom side i saw but then then he disappeared again emir emir yeah i'm telling my son if they are using internet there or the internet yeah yeah so yeah so if we if we like you were gonna pull efe
SPEAKER_04: And now the match is not going to happen. You said that something is wrong with your arm. Is that because of all that pressure between Todd and you? Yeah, it was just directly after the match. Something just doesn't feel connected properly. I'm just not able to put the same amount of pressure on it. I don't know if it's an injury. I just need more time to recover. It's hard to tell, but I just know that my arm is not ready for any sort of match right now.
SPEAKER_01: i did one table time practice and things just did not feel right at all so you are saying that you felt it right away but you were hoping that you know it could be something temporarily and then be gone exactly now you realize that it's so confused and then yeah so you think that you know you will not be ready to take time i understand exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah i want to make sure i'm coming in at a 100 to to be ready for him
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah yeah yeah whenever you pull uh international super match you cannot afford uh any other laws even if you lose you wouldn't want this to happen because because you are not ready yeah yeah yeah if i lose i want to know that i i was the best version of myself and uh my competitor was just better yeah yeah i agree with you this smart smart decision yeah anyway so if we go and
SPEAKER_01: Talk about East versus West. Yeah, yeah. What do you think about the card is is as good as last time? I think the card might be better than last time, even in my opinion. I'm really excited for a lot of these matches and I think a lot of the matches are really, really close on the card. Yeah, yeah. And what was it? What's the match that you would like to? By the way, I injured my lower back.
SPEAKER_01: a few days ago when i was doing barbell curls standing barbell curl and i just had this normally i was laying down i used some um muscle relaxers you know shots um and but so i'm kind of in pain right now but
SPEAKER_04: i i need to uh promote the event so yeah i'm sorry to hear that i also i also injured my lower back dead lifting like a month and a half ago i've been just trying to rest but uh i went to the doctor yesterday and they said they think i fractured my spine so yeah it's unlucky for us both i guess but uh
SPEAKER_01: a match that the one of the matches, I mean, I'm looking forward to a lot of them. I'm really looking forward to Unger Bayev and Marcio. I think that match is really, really, it could go either way. It's really close. How do you see? Technically, how do you see? I'm not asking you, but you can also share your prediction. But technically, how do you expect what they can do, what they cannot do? Do you think like Marcio can hook him?
SPEAKER_04: I don't think Marcio can hook him. I think Marcio's path to victory is going to be through the outside game. You know, his high post, his traditional high post and driving sideways. Ungerbaev was in the same class as Marcio in Zloty in, what, 2018, right? I think. Yeah. Or 17.
SPEAKER_04: 17. Okay. Yeah. And, and on goodbye, I've ended up winning. Um, and that's when Marcio lost to, uh, to, uh, go Jack. No, uh, the. Oh, it was overalls. It was overalls. Yeah. And overalls. Yeah. Yeah. Overalls. But my Marcia had like minutes log matches in the under five kilo weight category. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Um, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I really don't know what way it's going to go. Ungerbaev has been looking really impressive, but I haven't seen so much on a big stage from him. He recently, didn't he lose in his class? Yeah, it was about like one and a half months ago. Yeah. I heard that, you know, he had some shoulder surgery and he's coming back. So it was about one and a half months ago and
SPEAKER_01: he spent one month more to train and now he has more than one month. And what I heard that, you know, he will be ready and he's just in a camp and train like crazy. This is what I heard. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if, if he's able to commit his shoulder and drive inside, I think it's, it's going to be a long day for Marcio. I think Marcio needs to keep him outside of his shoulder and control his hand. I don't think Marcio should hook him, um, at all.
SPEAKER_01: so you are expecting both of them to go top versus top row and partially will go strap and then then the one that is stronger wrist will survive and post i think yeah yeah i mean you may have a post but if your wrist is not so much handling you know
SPEAKER_01: i mean then i don't know how much it will mean you may have less back pressure than your opponent but you know stronger wrist you know then you know even when you do a hammer curl with a thick bar you know i mean it as much as your wrist handles you know once it drops you know just right you can't really use it you know yeah yeah yeah yeah i guess i guess the the rise is more important here i i don't expect to yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah, both. I kind of see like riser and I kind of in strap, you know, think about a lot about that wrist solidness with a good lat, you know. Of course, I mean, I'm a believer in strap to block the guy with the lat and then add in the after screwing, you know, your hand and wrist and then top rolling going for outside for pronation.
SPEAKER_04: so how do you see like in the percentage how do you see the match going i i think it's pretty close maybe um i would give a slight edge to to hunger by a 55 45 something like that yeah yeah i think i think marcio will come there like a bull as well this is what i expect him to yeah no i i expect to see a really strong version of marcio show up absolutely
SPEAKER_04: Marcio, when he was at, there was a Mr. Olympia tournament back in October where I saw him compete. Nobody slowed him down at all. That was at the 105 class. He looked very, very good on the right side. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I saw him in great shape. You mean like versus Krasimir? No, that was before. I saw him in October of last year.
SPEAKER_04: And he was in Florida competing. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. For the last minute event you're talking about. Yes. The last minute event. And he looked, he looked really, really strong to me in that event. You're talking about the event that, you know, they announced like one week. Yeah. Yeah. Two weeks something. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So he showed up to that with, you know, just last, last second and he did really, really good.
SPEAKER_04: did he look did he look any bigger or better than the shape that he was versus krasimir i wasn't there in person uh so it's hard to say you know based off of video versus in person but um he he looked in fantastic shape i would guess better shape than when he pulled krasimir interesting because it's a last last minute you know
SPEAKER_01: announcement for an event and him to be that ready is interesting yeah because i saw him you know after he pulled with krasimir that whenever he did those those bicep pulls and everything he just look i mean you know very scary yeah he looked really good when he pulled krasimir absolutely yeah yeah yeah yeah so what's the next next one that is interested for you uh and like i said they're all interesting um i'm really interested to see the dave versus gennady rematch
SPEAKER_01: do you expect from there you you pull you pull dave in the same event in orlando right yeah i did yeah he he's strong he's strong yeah alex was going to beat him in dubai yeah and it didn't go that way
SPEAKER_04: No, not at all. Dave's looking in really, really good form, which is great to see. I know he was telling me before he didn't feel that great after his neck injury quite a few years ago, but it looks like it's not bothering him nearly as much as it used to because for him to be Alex in the fashion that he did was really, really impressive. And then, of course, we just saw Gennady at your event beat Michael again in very dominating fashion. So
SPEAKER_04: it's just um to me it's really interesting to find out uh if the gap is closer because they when they pulled in what 2017 was it 2017 when uh dave b ganadi 4-2 either 17 or 18 either of them okay yeah and it seemed like uh gannati was starting to come back in the
SPEAKER_04: You know, he won the last two rounds, but it was close enough where if he found a better lane, he might have been able to tie it 3-3 even. So I'm curious to see if this fired up version Gennady and this strong version of Dave have a closer match or if Dave is just too strong for Gennady right now. You know, at those years, Gennady was still pulling at WAF. Yep. He didn't pull 2018 WAF, but I think he pulled 2018 Europeans as well.
SPEAKER_01: I know. So I think, um, right now is stronger than that time. Yeah. And, and I don't know about Dave, but Dave, how to say, uh, because of that, uh, because of those top rollers, I think that he decided to train his brain that even harder and harder and harder.
SPEAKER_01: in the way that we saw him beating Kurdesha even he didn't have the wrist I'm talking about the earlier rounds later he also had the wrist but but he was his side pressure was already incredible and now he added a very solid tornado even he loses his wrist he also makes his opponent to lose the wrist and then there's the side pressure pure side pressure that is probably one of the best if not the best in the world
SPEAKER_01: he's beating his opponent. So I am, if you remember, he also beat Gennady in the same way, similar way. Yes. Like a pronation, you know, outer side pressure, I call. And so what I try to say that I think he's now stronger and more experienced about that kind of bullet. Yes. But Gennady is also strong. My opinion, Dave is stronger than Gennady.
SPEAKER_01: But if it is not so much to dominate Gennady and if the match somehow stops somewhere, I can say that Kurdesha may have better hand and wrist than Gennady, but I am almost sure that Gennady has more horsepower and he is more well-rounded to pull in bad positions as long as it stops his opponent at some point.
SPEAKER_01: And if he can do that, if Dave cannot dominate him, then I can see that the match may go to the endurance game. So if it goes there, then that may be bad news for Dave. But it is not a six round. It's best of five. Dave only needs to win three times. So this is my opinion.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah. And last time they pulled, if that matters, Gennady couldn't get it to where it mattered about endurance until the final two rounds. So if he's not able to close the strength gap enough to draw it out and have long matches early on, I think we're going to possibly see the Dave 3-0 sweep.
SPEAKER_04: even though maybe over six rounds Gennady wins uh or at least ties at 3-3 you know it's it's it's just a matter of is Gennady strong enough to close the gap to uh to make it about endurance I think yeah so it looks like there are possibilities that Gennady may dominate him
SPEAKER_01: They dominate Gennady or somehow Gennady stops the match and then brings the match to endurance game and then, you know, hardly wins the matches. Those are two possibilities. We never know. We never know what's going to happen. We can only talk about the possibilities. Hello, Pradeep. Hello. Welcome. You are late again.
SPEAKER_01: and whenever i invite someone on my zoom it always works fine but whenever someone else invites me it never lets me join until i restart my computer at least four or five times yeah i understand yeah okay there is from kevin kamke thank you for super chat i thought chance gave thought his hardest match as of late would you attribute that to your training program in sweden
SPEAKER_04: Do you think that your training program made you that good to give Todd such a hard match? Yeah, I mean, maybe you guys know, maybe you don't. But while I was in Sweden, I started Brandon Allen's training program. And I've been focusing just on overall strength and getting stronger. And I think that helped a lot in my last match with Todd.
SPEAKER_04: And then on top of that, when I was in Sweden living with my training partner, Emil Ekström, he made sure that I did not miss a single training, did not miss a single meal. He just stayed on top of me, making sure that everything was on point. So here when I'm home, I don't have that same sort of motivation.
SPEAKER_04: so i think that my time in sweden and my new training program with brandon allen i think both of those are huge factors um to to why i was able to give todd the match that i was i think had i pulled him maybe three four months prior before i did that i don't think it would have been a very close match yeah so if i heard it correctly again the match between chance and fa comic is off now right
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah yeah because chance chance uh didn't feel his arm good after that match and he doesn't he can't even train properly to push his limits to you know give his hundred percent
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that is really unfortunate to hear because in chances last three or four super matches, I think this was the first time when in general audience polls, Chancho was the favorite for the first time. I think otherwise always, he has always been the underdog and not by a small margin, always by big margin, like 80, 20 underdog or against Tata chinks. The chance was 97 to 300 dog in YouTube polls. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this was the first time. I was looking forward to pulling FA, but I don't want to show up if I'm not at 100%. There's no reason for me to have any sort of match when I'm not at my best. Not at this point, at least. After losing a few matches in a row, I think that it is time for you to not to try to top of the mountain, but just, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: yeah i agree i agree yeah i mean someone that you know he may be in top 10 in the world in overall you know this guy is i mean i can't say that you know just like he in top 10 nobody can be uh he cannot beat anybody or something this guy i mean even if he loses five like five guys just say dominate him just say lalitin dominate him just say ms dominate him just say
SPEAKER_01: Levan dominating, but other five guys, even if they beat him, I'm sure that he would give them hell. Yeah. And he's not even a super heavyweight. No, I think he's like 230 pounds or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 105. And if you talk about Hutchings versus Irakli. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's it's an interesting match. I want Hutchings to win 3-0, right? I'll feel better about myself. I'm like, come on, you gotta win 3-0. So for a few reasons, one is American. Yes, then two. He recently beat you, so you wouldn't want him to lose against someone at his own weight.
SPEAKER_01: No, no. I want him to flash Pinarakli three times in a row like he did to Jordan Sonev. If he's able to do that, I'll feel amazing. I don't think it's going to happen. I agree. I don't think, but this is what I hope. Yeah, I understand. I don't think that's going to happen. If Todd wins, I don't think that he's going to win by domination, but by endurance as always. That creates a side pressure. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Let's see, let's see which way he will try to go. Will he try to hook? Will he try to protect his pronator just in case? But I see that Todd, also Todd, I think first round you want to go to step as well together with him. So first round, when I pulled him,
SPEAKER_04: he was saying that he was going to top roll me, but I thought he was joking, but he loaded up with a high post pressure. And I'm like, ah, I think if I hold onto this, it's not a smart move. So I loaded up high with him and I just decided to slip. My original game plan was not to go to the straps with him and Rob, but it just ended up, uh, I think that was my best option at that point. Do you, did you realize that last round he actually toppled you at the end? Yeah. Yeah. But yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Fair. Well, whenever you're tired, when you are tired, when you're exhausted, I mean, you are done, you know. And that guy, almost like same as Devon, you know, he just doesn't get tired, you know. No, no, he doesn't. But I don't know. I know Irakli is getting stronger all the time, but when he pulled Mosher, it looks like he doesn't have enough side pressure to...
SPEAKER_04: to consider going sideways with I don't think he should go inside at all I think if he decides to go inside that Todd will actually flash I think if he loads up and goes outside and tries to control the pronator tries to control the hand and wrist then it'll be a war in that case but if he goes inside I don't think it'll be a good day for a medal
SPEAKER_04: Do you think that if Todd goes inside, he will be successful and he will easily beat Irakli? Yes. Do you think that he can hook Irakli? That's the thing. I think only if Irakli, number one, is tired because they've had wars, he can get hooked. Or number two, he wants to test the hook, so he goes there. So do you think on round one, he cannot hook? I don't think round one, Todd Hutchings can set the hook against Irakli. No. That risk...
SPEAKER_00: will be like this yes but we just don't know where it will go to where it can go even if it goes bad we don't know if it if it can go more than once or not we will see right yeah yeah yeah because because sasho was in round one sasho was not able to hook a 90 kg racquet and right now he's 105 and he's young also so when someone is young he generally progresses at a higher rate than the guy who let's say is 40 years old
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, even round two wasn't easy. And round one, I saw Sasho was totally supinated, and then he gave opportunity for Iraki to control Taz's pronator and beat him. And then round two, when I saw Sasho went inner side pressure, he still had pronator. And there he couldn't control so much, and then he couldn't go. So what I'm just saying is,
SPEAKER_01: Irakli's wrist against people who have very strong pronators is not as dominant as like Prudnik's. He is more likely pulling here and then pressing with here. Sometimes even with the flat wrist, he's pressing. So let's see, let's see. Where Todd is strongest is the problem that Irakli has.
SPEAKER_01: having control and not having enough side pressure. But as you said, he's now 105 kilo and maybe different story. But I saw him training with Revas Lucidze, who is a pure top roller. I don't know how good idea it is if he's really getting ready for touchings with training with Revas, because we're talking about Revas and Todd.
SPEAKER_01: I know different type of pullers. Iraq needs to train with someone with a lot of horsepower. This is my opinion. I agree. Yeah. And what do you think about John and Zurab? Many people think that it is going to be easy.
SPEAKER_04: I thought when the match was first announced, I thought it would be a good test to see where John's arm is at. However, after watching Paul Lin beat Ron Bath inside three times, and we just saw Paul Lin and John Brzenk have their match, I personally think that John is going to control the match anywhere that he wants to. Even in a hook? Even in a hook.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but do you think that there is a possibility that, you know, Ron that we saw in Istanbul and Ron that we saw versus Paul was a little bit, you know, different? Maybe 5%. Not enough to make a huge difference, in my opinion. Yeah, I understand. No, what I'm just saying is, do you think that there was... How long was it? Five weeks? Five weeks, yeah. 34 days there was. Five weeks, yeah. Five weeks, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think that, you know, he had some kind of, like, those matches were like killer matches. Like, from beginning to the end, like, it took, like, more than 45 minutes. So, considering he's 60 years old, how long time did he have to recover after such a match? And how long time did he have to train and then rest in five weeks? This is what I try to ask you.
SPEAKER_00: Chances frozen. Yeah, chances frozen? Yep.
SPEAKER_00: So I think, again, I will give you my honest opinion about this. In the previous East vs West event, East vs West 2, I said very clearly in my prediction videos that I think the card is absolutely awesome. All matches are close except for only one match. And I said that in my opinion, there is only one mismatch on this card and that was Ronbeth vs F.A. Komek. Because that to me was almost clear that it seemed to be like a mismatch after we saw Herman Stevens vs F.A. Komek. And this time, I think...
SPEAKER_00: There may be only one mismatch where Zorab is definitely going to be a huge underdog against John. Because I'm not sure if even Todd Hutchings right now can beat John without his wrist. Like he has to cup John to beat him. John will for sure take Zorab's wrist. And I don't think Zorab can go through John's arm without his wrist. So he knows how to finish. Emir. Emir. Is Shashank Zorab?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you hear? Yeah, I can hear you. People are saying that Pradeep is going to have a Brazil chat show. Yeah, can they watch the event? The live stream is okay? There's no problem, right? Yes, yes. No, there's no problem. So Chance is saying that Chance is trying to reset his internet. His internet is cut off. Okay, okay, okay. I hope he's going to join. So I want to ask his opinion about other matches as well.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think that Zurab will be also better than last time we saw him. Because this is like his dream match. And I kind of think that he will be even a little bit better than last time we saw him. Yeah. John knows how to finish the match when it stops. The only way that possible if Zurab's side pressure
SPEAKER_01: may cause problems to jones pronader if the match goes inside that may not be that easy we will see we will see i really don't know where zurab is actually you know i really don't know i don't know how good he is we will we will soon soon find out but i also see john favorites can you switch to split screen like right now only they can only see one of us
SPEAKER_00: after chance left only one of us is visible like um how do i do that i don't know i'm not sure about mobile maybe some right swipe or something gallery options i think there is some option like that if chance joins it will be automatically in split screen i think sorry about it if if i'm correct there is no weight cap for this match right
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah done we both are visible now yeah okay okay good good yeah what do you say what did you just say so there is no weight cap for this match i think john is not interested in cutting weight for anyone no no no there is there is 105 kilo
SPEAKER_00: 105 kilo but even in such matches weight cap doesn't really mean much like you versus john like if john can weigh 100 kilos and you can weigh 95 kilos it looks like it is only a 5 kg difference but still john is naturally a larger human being i think the same case is going to be with zurab versus john as well even if they are at the same weight still john is going to be a much larger human being than zurab i understand but zurab doesn't have like 10 15 kilo on around his belly like i do
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, welcome. Welcome back. Yeah, we were talking about John and Zurab and then you are saying that John will have no problems, is what you're saying Chance or I misunderstood? Yeah, I don't think John will have any sort of problem anywhere. Yeah, I understand, yeah. Are you familiar with Samusha, David Samusha? He's Georgian. Georgian guy, they will pull Pauline.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I wasn't familiar with him until I heard about the match and then I did some research on him. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I don't have too much information. I was just kind of studying a little on his style. Did you see his match with Sandris when Sandris won the 105 kilo Zloty Turf? Are you there, Pradeep?
SPEAKER_00: yes yes okay he's he's internet again um that's problems there anyway so what do you think about samusha and pauline david samusha pauline so when i did some research i think it was 2019 he was left-handed 85 kg web champion and right-handed silver medalist david samusha david samusha or 2018 champion no i don't think so no so
SPEAKER_01: He was 75 kilo and 80 kilo world champion with right arm. And left? Right arm, right arm. His left is not as good as his right. Okay, I think it's right. You probably checked the wrong guy. Oh, maybe I'm forgetting something. Paul in, I think the first weight cap was 95 kilos for that match and then you changed it to 100? Yeah, yeah. Because I heard that, you know, David Samusha will be
SPEAKER_01: around 95 as well. So he is going from up from 86, 87 to 94, 95. And then I didn't want all to cut weight while one is going up. So, and then I talked with Georgia and they said, it's okay. You know, it's, you know, all is fine. So, yeah, because I, I don't know, but then I saw Pauline versus Rhombet. Then I was like, Oh, did I make a mistake? I don't know. We will see. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But Samusha gave a very hard match to Sandris. And he was only 78 kilos, 171 pounds. That's low to two overalls. And I think Samusha was third place or something, and Sandris was second in the overalls, if I'm not mistaken. And so what I'm just thinking that Samusha, if he's 94, 95 kilos, of course he's not such a tall guy. I don't know how much mass, how much fat.
SPEAKER_01: how much water will be, but still will be very dangerous, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: i think this can be another ron beth versus zorob type of match i definitely think it is going to be very close and i may give slight advantage to paul lin in this match because as you said he was a champion in 75 and 80 kilos paul lin is going to paul lin is very like very strict on cutting weight like if he is going to compete in 100 kilos he is going to be 104 5 kilos the next day it is not the entire muscle mass gain water gain i we can say it is not that much effective but but
SPEAKER_01: Paulin is going to be bigger, definitely. I saw Paul saying that he doesn't feel good at 100 kilos. He feels like he himself is pushing to be there. So he says that he feels better around 200 pounds, 90 kilos. So what I just think that how Samusha feels around 80, 84 or something is
SPEAKER_01: what Paul is feeling at 93, 92, 94, whatever, you understand? So I think that both Samusha and Paul will be pushing themselves to be that heavy.
SPEAKER_01: Their natural weight is not that big. I heard this from Paul that, you know, he wants to be around 90 kilo puller. So, he is bigger. So, Chance, your internet is gone again. I was telling you that Davos Samusha, he was only 171 pounds, 78 kilo. And he gave very, very hard match to Sandris. I think 2018 Zlotitur overalls while he was only 171. And now this guy will be about
SPEAKER_01: very near to 210. So what do you think if you judge that way? And this guy is very strong inside. And what do you think? He gave him problems inside? Yeah, he took him inside. And they had a war. They had a war. And Sandri is hardly won, hardly.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. That doesn't tell me too much because it was overall. So, you know, I don't know the condition of their arms going into that. And also, Sandrus is a fantastic puller. But from what I felt inside, he's not that strong. In my training time with Paul Lynn, I think Paul Lynn is maybe a little stronger than I am on the inside. And I felt that I was pretty...
SPEAKER_04: I was a decent amount stronger than Sanders on the inside, of course. So if that's his best spot is inside, it's hard for me to judge because they don't have any common opponents. You know, of course, yes, I've pulled Sanders and I've pulled Paul, but on the inside, it's hard. The question is, when you pull Paul inside, was your inside as good as when you pulled Sanders? No, but Paul was beating me.
SPEAKER_04: um every time when i pulled him oh i understand yeah so yeah it's it's it's fine
SPEAKER_00: I want to add two things. You mentioned about Paul's weight. So I also interviewed Paul and if I remember correctly, he said that he feels really heavy and difficult to breathe at around 225-230 pounds, the weight at which he showed up against John Brzezink. He feels good at 210-215, 95-200 kilos, not 90. So he feels comfortable around that weight, 210-215.
SPEAKER_00: But I'm quite sure this match is big enough for him that it doesn't matter if he feels bad or not. He is going to gain weight for this match, for sure. And one more thing that John Brzezink, when he faced Paul Lin, John clearly mentioned after the match that he definitely thinks that Paul is clearly ready to face the elites at that 90-95 kg weight. This is what John Brzezink said after the Paul Lin match.
SPEAKER_04: One interesting thing John Brzenk said to me directly after his match with Zoliev, because I was standing there in his corner, he said, yeah, Zoliev feels basically the same as Paul Lennon. He said that maybe a little bit stronger than Paul inside, he said. Yes, maybe a little, but he was like, wow, this is very close. Just trust me, that wasn't the best of Zoliev.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, I'm not saying it was, but the Zolev that showed up that day is similar to, I think, the Paulin that's going to show up in East versus West. Yeah, probably. Yeah, Paulin, yeah, very strong inside. But as I said, you know, Zolev probably would do better, better. I think he also had COVID. It is not like Marcio Barbosa got COVID one month before.
SPEAKER_01: And he just canceled his match at East versus West. We just couldn't, couldn't, for me especially, that I promised I had to. Anyway, so if we talk about more, we covered that, that, that, that, and then, yeah, Matt Mask. Do you also believe that it's a mismatch with Rodney? No, I don't think so. No? No.
SPEAKER_01: I think stylistically, it's a really good match. Yeah. Do you follow the chat, Pradeep? Yeah, I'm following the chat. If there is any interesting questions, you can also ask. It doesn't have to be Superchat. How do you see that, Matt Mask versus Prudnik? I think this... No, no, ask him, then you say that later. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So very short answer. I want to ask him, you know, technically what he expects. I mean, I think I think Rudnick will be trying to control the hand.
SPEAKER_04: keeping Matt from getting outside. But I think it's really difficult to keep Matt from taking your wrist. I don't know if I've ever seen somebody hook Matt Mask, at least not in the last few years. He's really, really difficult to hook. If you want to beat him, you have to be able to control high and over, in my opinion, in my experience, training with him at least.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know if Prudnik has the long enough arm to do that. He might, but I really see Matt taking Prudnik's hand at least the first round. I think it could go straight to the pad.
SPEAKER_04: uh prudnik i think has the better endurance over matt and if prudnik can turn it inside or can stop it and get it on his arm i think that he should be the heavy favorite at that point but i would say that um it's not a mismatch prudnik should be the favorite maybe 65 35 something like that but i i do think that there's a clear path to victory for matt in my book 65 to 35 is just like
SPEAKER_04: huge difference whenever i see something close i go like more like 53 to 47 or something to me to me that's still a close match because uh 35 chance that you're gonna win that's that's not too bad that's one out of three times that you have that match that that puller wins that's the way i look at it yeah okay and and braddy what do you think
SPEAKER_00: I think that this is going to look easy for Prodnik because Prodnik is much much more battle tested and how many times
SPEAKER_00: matt mask has traveled overseas to compete three times in his career maybe once or twice in united states for big events and once in england and once in your your event i think that's about it and i think that prudnik is a high level arm wrestler round one can go like this he takes his wrist but whenever matt hits his arm goes like this but i don't think he will be able to finish the match and by round
SPEAKER_01: Two and three, I think it is going to look easy for Prudnik and he may also hook him in the last couple of matches, rounds. I understand. And Morozov versus Matz with left arm? You know, Matz left in a fresh training. Of course, it's only training, but look better than Devon's. I don't know if you saw the last training. And do you think that Matz can beat Morozov, lefty? You saw Morozov closely versus Tobias.
SPEAKER_04: Are you asking me? Yeah. Yeah. I think that Matt will lose left-handed. Um, I don't think it's that close because Morozov is tall enough and his style of a posting top roll, I think is the, is the hardest style for, for Matt to pull against. Um, maybe, maybe Matt can get one round, but I think that, uh, I think that Morozov will control it personally. Do you realize that Morozov tried top roll versus Tobias and
SPEAKER_01: I mean, he was put in a bad position after he tried the spinated side pressure type of hook. Yes, yeah. Yeah, he couldn't. So you think that he couldn't top roll Tobias, but he can top roll Matt. In my opinion, Tobias would beat Matt as well. What's that? I think Tobias' left hand would beat Matt as well. Oh, yeah, because very, very strong hand, hard to.
SPEAKER_01: And the same thing, long lever and can control. I think they all are about the same height. 95, 97, 94, whatever you know. Yeah. And what do you think Pradeep?
SPEAKER_00: I think if this match was right-handed Matt versus Morozov, I would have favored Matt in that match. Just because of the performance that we saw from Morozov against Tobias and Prudnik. Like his hand did not look really incredible against both of them. And Matt's hand is really good. And Matt can also engage some power. He's not elite inside a hook, but he can at least hold opponents to tire him and maybe look for opportunity to top roll if he's not able to do that in the early rounds.
SPEAKER_00: Left handed this match I think can be really really close in my opinion because definitely Morozov is going to be strong in a hook but from what we saw in the match against Tobias his hand did not look great. I'm not saying that Matt is Tobias but I think Matt's hand should be slightly not by a huge margin should be slightly better than Morozov.
SPEAKER_01: But still, I think Morozov's all-around game inside his speed, I think it will be just a little bit too much. And this is one of the matches, in my opinion, that you were talking about earlier, Engin, 53-47, like a really close match. When you say Morozov's hand didn't look so good, sometimes you may have incredibly strong hand, but once you pull against someone who has stronger hand, your hand doesn't look that good, you know. That may be the case with Tobias, and we all know his hand strength, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And Krasimir versus Arif, Chance? Yeah, so correct me if I'm wrong, but Arif has beat Krasimir the last couple times they pulled. They pulled three times, and all three times Arif flash pinned Krasimir, but six years ago it was all those three were 2016 Europeans, and 2016... In 2016 Europeans, Krasimir wasn't so fresh. He had
SPEAKER_01: very tough match with Levan, and he beat Levan. You know, he wasn't so really fresh. But then they met fresh match in WAF, and then same year, the result was the same. Okay. Yeah, I'm still leaning towards Krasimir. But maybe not. I think...
SPEAKER_04: In my head, I have to say that I think Krasimir should be the favorite. Just based off of all of his past matches, he's competed against the best guys in the world. Not that Arif hasn't, but Arif has been pulling in WAF, so
SPEAKER_04: he's at least limited a little bit on the, on the floors that he can pull. But last time I talked to Krazy, Krazy was telling me that, that Georgie was beating him. No problem. So if that's still the case today, then I think Arif will walk through Krasimir. Arif beat Georgie at the last swap. Yep. Arif also had a winning record against Gennady as well. Yep.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but like you said before, Gennady today, now that he's not in the WAF, is probably a stronger version. So, you know, it's hard to draw a perfect comparison. Yeah, and if you consider the RF still continues as well. Yeah, yeah, true. And Brady?
SPEAKER_00: So again, when I don't have enough data about the match to, like, give a knowledgeable opinion, a knowledgeable prediction, I never go against history. And history is that Arif beats Krasimir. And now he's, what, 50 kilos heavier than Krasimir, I think? Probably he will be around 145 kg and then Krasimir will be a maximum. It was the same case at that time as well.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so Arif has always been around that 145-150 weight. I mean, I remember he was 140-145 or something and then Karasimir was again 100-205. He never is heavier than that.
SPEAKER_00: Because at the East vs. West 2 event, I saw that Arif weighed 155 kilos, something like that. And I was like, Arif is basically almost Levan's size right now. Like, a little bit smaller. But right now, we saw that Levan is over 400 pounds. But Levan has also competed in the last 2-3 years, sometimes around that 165 kg weight. So, 155 is a huge, huge gap. And 150, if Arif shows around that weight. And he has beaten him in the past as well. So, he knows how to beat Krasimir. So, I never bet against history.
SPEAKER_01: never until i have seen something incredible to change my opinion i never bet against history yeah chance is gonna leave soon and i want to quickly ask about some other matches and then uh are you going to talk about michael versus rivas because there is a super chat related to that yeah what's what do you think about michael versus
SPEAKER_04: I don't have that much information about Ravaz. I'm not super familiar with him. I would just be guessing if I gave much commentary. I will say that Michael is looking like he's improving and kind of going back to his old style. He's looking like he's fixing his riser and his pronator. Just in a little bit of practice footage of when he was pulling with Eric Smith. He's looking...
SPEAKER_01: better but I don't I'm not familiar enough with his opponent to say I think it would go one way or another I'm rooting for Michael because he's the North American yeah but I didn't see his old style like this but I saw if you realize it I saw that he did some like rowing like let move at the start and then he went to sideway but he didn't really go so much like this but I saw this video
SPEAKER_04: Yes, I agree in the practice, he was doing that. But I mean, in what it sounds like and talks with him, is he's going to start going back to his old style and dropping lower and getting his hand higher. But I meant in the fashion of, it looks like his training is going well based off of his practice and his strength. Cuz we all know at this point that Derek Smith is a very strong individual. It's practice, whatever, but still, I think Michael looked pretty strong there.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And so again, I watched Derek Smith's live stream after that practice, it was one hour, 10 minute live stream. So during that, somebody asked him about that practice with Michael and Derek mentioned that prior to that, he had a workout. So, you know, when we do a lot of hammer curls and this muscle has some pain,
SPEAKER_00: and your hammer curl motion is basically gone like you can feel you can apply a lot of power but there is a sharp pain here so derek was mentioning that he was having some pain here so he cannot do this hammer curl motion to climb over his end so basically he had to rely on his cupping to turn his pronator and trying to beat him so his hammer curl motion was not there so that is why it was looking like michael is kind of controlling derek smith this is what derek told us about that match yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: possible there is one yeah i i talked with derek as well he said he was the best best shape of him for sure but you know again you know training that's how michael look and then they need to i almost said uh derek almost in last minute with with uh the zerano from kazakhstan and the zelano and i we couldn't uh agree on the conditions
SPEAKER_01: and hopefully next time, but he was almost coming in. I think Derek is still coming and he's going to join us. Hopefully it looks like that way for commentary. And I also ask Travis, it would be good for the announcement. No, the chance didn't like it for announcement, but no arm wrestling. No, no, no, no. The youth arm wrestler that just did well in worlds. Yeah. Oh, from Turkey.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah anyway so okay i i invited and he's gonna soon answer me and then yeah he will be announcing if he accepts income you know it will be uh great it will be great yeah but not not super much not super much yeah okay what what's this what's left
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, there was a again there was one super chat about this match Possibly a question for you from Kevin Temke another five Canadian dollar super match What is Riva's looted say estimated world rankings right now? If Riva's wins, this is MMT out of top 10 side note Prudnik is the number one in the world at 242 pounds. This is what he believes. Yeah, I agree. Thank you for super shit I am NOT a fan of bringing someone back to
SPEAKER_01: Behind the, I mean, in my mind, my logic, if you beat someone who is ranked above you, you take his spot. You don't bring the other guy down. You know, this, this is how my logic, you know, um, like if whatever Michael is ranked now, then if there was wins, he will be ranked right above him. Yeah. That, that happened with Kurdesha. It is because Kurdesha's ranking was not so much.
SPEAKER_01: Like, it was newly, newly, you know, ranking. I think from now on, we will see more solid ranking. Which match did we miss? Did you guys talk about Tobias still has a match, correct? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He has a right arm match. He's going to pull Morozov right arm. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: What do you guys think? You told us that Tobias' left is much stronger than his right. And if Morozov beat him on his left, I don't think it is going to be close on right as well. Yeah, you think he will hook him again and beat him?
SPEAKER_04: Yes. I think it'll look similar to the last match where if Tobias is able to really grip the hand and rip sideways, he can get some pins. I think it's possible, but I think that it'll be just as much of a gap inside if Morozov is able to set the hook. Yeah, so Morozov has more horsepower, but it's going to be effective only if he can use, if he can get his spot to use it.
SPEAKER_01: And Tobias probably has better hand and wrist control. Like outside versus outside, Tobias will look better. This is your opinion as far as I understand. But if somehow Morozov applies successfully what he did last time, then he will not be so close because Morozov looks stronger with more horsepower. More horsepower, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yep, that's my opinion. Yeah. I'll be rooting for Tobias, though. I lived in the same town as him for three months, so I have to root for him, right? Did you train with him? Did you train with him when you were there? Can you believe it? I lived in the town with him for three months. We didn't train a single time. How did that happen?
SPEAKER_04: uh the time we were supposed to train he tested positive for covid then we were supposed to train again there was a snow storm so i couldn't get the bus we're supposed to train again i had a stomach uh bugs and i was throwing up just uh every time we try to train something happens yeah yeah yeah okay anyways i think you want to say something ready
SPEAKER_01: yeah i i was checking your community page and there you mentioned another match for marcio barboza i was not aware for that left-handed match against sahih from turkey yeah yeah mars also uh yeah yeah ffa versus drop as well the sahib challah will pull marcio barboza the sahib challah has finished fourth in the world in the past you know he gave some troubles to very top athletes he has
SPEAKER_01: I mean, without the strap is a little bit stronger, but his left is very, very good. Sahib's left arm is very good. He's going to pull versus Barbosa, of course.
SPEAKER_01: You both have no idea about Sahip, but very big hand, very strong. Maybe you saw the practice videos that he pulled twice with Prudnik with left. One time he top-rolled him, and second time Prudnik hooked him. Prudnik underestimated him. East versus West event in Istanbul after that. Is he that guy who's really, really heavy? No, not. Maximum 110 kilos, maximum.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he just one time he top rolled Prudnik and then with left arm and then second time Prudnik started a little bit like spinated and hook him, you know. And of course that point they stopped pulling, yeah. I don't know, outside versus outside, it can be a good match, especially, I don't know. Let's see, let's see how it will be. And what do you think about Efe's drop? Chance.
SPEAKER_04: I just wanted to comment on, um, Marcio. I'm not familiar with the other guy, but, uh, while Marcio was in Florida, I saw him lose to, uh, um, to fresh. So, and I know fresh and world says sometimes placed as low as, or maybe it was, uh, Zloty is placed as low as seven. Maybe he's stronger now, but, uh, if this guy is, is competing with our ref sometimes,
SPEAKER_04: and Prudnik and things like that, I think that he will be able to control Marcio. That's just my guess. But as far as Zurab and FA left, Brita and Ron were close in their match. Zurab, of course, just beat Brita pretty convincingly and Ron beat, I mean, FA beat Ron even more convincingly.
SPEAKER_04: I have to imagine that FA being the heavier puller. FA is what, about 110 now? More, more, more. Minimum 115, minimum. Okay, yeah. So if he's 115, I think that with his style, he'll be able to control Zurab's hand and wrist and take it outside. Of course, if Zurab can set the hook, I do imagine Zurab's much stronger there. But I think that FA will have too much outside for him.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think that Efe will be able to go there outside as long as he doesn't have any problem to the finishing because this guy, Zurab, can pull in very weird position with such a strong bicep. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if Efe has the shoulder press finishing power or not, but I don't know. We will see. I may go to Georgia very soon. I may, especially if my lower back heals up quick.
SPEAKER_01: And then I plan to go and talk with those guys and chat with them and see, you know, how they are. And then, yeah, we can, we can have some more ideas about how they are doing. Yeah. Anyway, so I think we covered everything and to see you in our next event, August event chance.
SPEAKER_01: And I want to also, did you guys see the t-shirt design? Yes. Yes, I did. It looks really nice. I think I saw it on John's Instagram. Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I hardly see it. I see it frozen. Maybe something is wrong with my internet. I think it's your internet. I can hear you guys. My internet? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Anyway, so I, I, the, the, these T-shirts are going to be done and you can, you, if you can, if you are interested, you can, uh, uh, get them through GoFundMe. And other than that, you know, soon, um, we will, we will, as I promised last time, you know, we will have some discounts, uh, for the next
SPEAKER_01: East versus West events for the people who purchased the last one, but we will announce how it is. And then I think for now, these are all I will say. And so thank you guys. Thank you very, very much. And hope to see you again in the future. Yeah, thanks for having me again. I appreciate it. Yeah, okay.
