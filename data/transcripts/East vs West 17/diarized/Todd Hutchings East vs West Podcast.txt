Engin Terzi: I think we started, yeah. Hello Todd, how are you? Howdy, I'm doing good. Wood, good. You happy? You get the belt again? Oh yeah, I carry it everywhere I go. I wear it to the grocery store. You're joking. Kind of. Yeah, but my question to you is that
Engin Terzi: how what kind of feeling is it that you left it and you took it back again oh it's great winning the belt i hope everybody gets a chance to do it sometime i love it but do you do you think that this time do you think that this time you will be able to defend it like two more times and and then permanently have it yeah i feel pretty good at this 95 pound class uh-huh yeah
Engin Terzi: Did you know that I talked with Ruslan? He already accepted. Wood for him. And what are the feelings? In the past when I was competing, I remember it was 1994 Worlds, I won it, but after the event,
Engin Terzi: guy from Spain you know we trained and he was just keeping here like a little bit far like here and then he was hooking me after pull like I tried to take him every time I try he was hooking me like like there was a trauma in my head if I meet this guy how am I gonna beat him and then four years later I met him in the semi-final of the WAF in Egypt and then we were undefeated
Engin Terzi: And like, I was so panicked about it. And then when the goal came and I hit him, he hit to the table surface, you know, like boom. Yeah. So what I just tried to say, like you lost against Rustam, as far as I remember, eight times, like eight rounds, I can say, you know, but every single time. Yeah. Yeah. Two times he beat you in, uh, Zloty 2005 in, um,
Engin Terzi: in 86-kilo category, I remember. And it was the same year that you beat John in Vegas. But he beat you. And then, was it 2017? Yeah, it was in Russia. I can't remember the year. No, no, no, no, no. He beat you at the Zlotysk Tour. Oh, right. Right, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. So what I'm just saying that right now I see you like completely different. The other day I was thinking about this, like you beat Irakli two years ago and in last two years we see how much Irakli progressed and you beat him again. So like, it sounds like not possible, but it looks like you are still progressing. Yeah. Yeah.
Todd Hutchings: me today would definitely beat me a while ago um i've never beat rustem i've never come close to beating him but i still somehow think i'm the favorite in this match if that makes any sense in arm wrestling science
Engin Terzi: I mean, it makes it this way. At least I cannot say that you're going to beat him, but I cannot say that you cannot beat him because, listen, you are not that predictable. You are one of those guys that really understand arm wrestling and then for each match you make a different strategy, the way to beat the guy.
Engin Terzi: But from other side, like two times you lost in last two years, and one was against Prudnik, which you defeated him later. And then the other one was Dadikyan. And both of these guys were the guys that controlled your pronator with their wrists, you know. While we also know that Ruslan is type of guy that using that, that copying, you know, very strong and effectively. While your pronator,
Engin Terzi: since last time you pull rustam just became something else so how how do you see this like like you said that you you you see you think yourself favorite something like that you said a while ago yeah i think yeah i would really love to beat rustam in a hook but i don't love that as much as i would love to just beat him so arachne arachne got sucked inside
Todd Hutchings: on three rounds with with rustum but arachne's top roll was very effective against rustum i got the advantage of studying that so um and rustum's good at he kind of comes down and chops you know so you can get your wrist out of there and hold his hand flat um but
Engin Terzi: I'll be honest, I mean, about two or three months before the Irakli match, I thought the Rustam match was coming. So I kind of started prepping for this two months ago. Oh, so you started to train for Rustam already? Yeah, 60 days ago. Oh, yeah, you are a true professional. You are just seriously. Like, we are... I'm making the matches and you are just...
Engin Terzi: preparing for them specifically, and it is very good. I respect that. I respect that. And of course, you wouldn't tell us, right, your strategy or anything. Like, what is at least your opinion? You can lie as well, you know. No, no, what's my opinion? I'm lying. Mislead Rustom. What's my opinion? I'll tell you, but what's the question?
Engin Terzi: I mean, the question is that what is important to beat Rustam? Do you think that with outside... First of all, Rustam Irakli was, I think, the first match after Rustam got injured against Paulin. So my opinion, just honest opinion, Rustam that you will face will probably be stronger than that one.
Engin Terzi: You versus Irakli was outside versus outside move, while you versus Rustam will probably be, if you're going outside, outside versus inside. He can also do topple. I know him, but I think one of the rounds he beat Irakli is kind of outside, I think he beat him. Yeah, he had Irakli deep in a hook once. I think he had him deep in a hook twice and then just kind of flat-handed side pressured him.
Todd Hutchings: But I also watched the matches with Paul Lynn, and I'm very familiar with how I ranked with Paul Lynn. I think if I was in the same position Paul Lynn was in, I would have won all those rounds. You mean in Orlando? In Orlando. Well, they pulled twice. Yes, but you're talking about the one in Orlando. Yeah. I'm talking about every round Rustem and Paul Lynn pulled.
Engin Terzi: And Rustam won all those rounds. I think I could have beat Rustam had I got... If I could stop Rustam like Paul then did, I think I can beat him. Okay, because two rounds that Rustam won in Istanbul, I don't think Paul stopped him. It was easy. The rounds that Rustam beat in Orlando, Paul was in an offensive position, and then Rustam stopped him here, and then... Okay, I understand. So you are saying that you need to put Rustam to...
Todd Hutchings: Losing position or at least at the... I got to get it stocked. I can't get slammed to the pad before I'm ready. So I'm going to, I mean, you'll see me, I'll put on my Devon Lorette hat and I'll get into a ref's grip and hopefully the straps, whatever it takes to slow that match down. Yeah, I understand. How do you compare your start with Paul Lin? Paul Lin's faster than me.
Todd Hutchings: But I think most of the time, even though he's quicker than me, most of the time, I mean, I don't want to talk about the guy when he's not here, but I think he'll agree that most of the time I could still pull him back. Yeah, once you stop him, probably. Yeah, yeah. I don't think Paul Lynn's quick enough to smash me to the pad like Rustem used to do when he was a little kid, before he became an old man. Okay, there is...
Engin Terzi: Big grow goals. Uh, how is two of my favorite people doing? I'm doing great. It looks like Todd is doing great as well, but Todd let Todd answer. How are you doing? Therrien's a question. Doing fantastic. I got, I got like the greatest life ever. Yeah. Yeah. And you said you were going to go outside and you went outside and do you think that you could hook? Exactly.
Todd Hutchings: um not in rounds one two or three i think in rounds four or five i think i could stop it and hold it long enough and turn it it would be the world's slowest hook but i think i could do it on round four or five you know i definitely on that last round five i could have because his arm was shot oh yeah he was tired yeah he was tired but it basically seemed to be like the first match
Engin Terzi: like i know how much he progressed so that's why i'm saying that you also progress i don't think that you progress with your power but you would know better but i think you progress more with the effectiveness and maybe the key muscle groups that made your power more effective yeah my power's up i do seven exercises i've increased four of them two percent
Engin Terzi: So I published, I'm very, I'm very open about where my strength is before every match. I will show what I've done in the last three months. You can say that you are more coordinated, right? Therrien is something called synergy. It really, for me, the key with the arm wrestling is synergy. That's why John Brzenk was, I mean, if you compare John Brzenk's finger, wrist, riser, pronated, everything. I mean, I don't think that he was the very best at every of them, but when you coordinate them and then, then
Engin Terzi: then you make the difference. And I think your coordination is better. In the past, it was like more like raw power. Now you have more pronator. And yeah, I think you are one of those guys that knows what he's doing. Therrien are not many of them. And I think that yours is even worser for your opponents because it is not orthodox. It is a unique way. And I think that because you start arm wrestling very late,
Engin Terzi: i i don't think that you are so smooth in your pulling and not like so quick hand but even you lose some wrist or something you know i think it looks like you are studying those muscle groups anatomy and everything and the way that i saw you pulling against ongarbev and some other guys yeah do you still think that you are still learning yeah it um that
Todd Hutchings: That comment you made about John about being able to do everything, you get that with certain people who are just like natural athletes. Athletes got that ability to do stuff where the rest of us that aren't naturally gifted athletes, we can get stronger, but we always look plodding and slow and awkward. But with years, your athleticism comes up.
Todd Hutchings: I I've gotten to a strength level now where when I study a future opponent, I can kind of work out something for me. You know, I would have a hard time. I'd have a hard time coaching other people how to do this. But I know what like I'm capable of doing in like 90 days. So I'm getting better and better at predicting what I can do.
Engin Terzi: I understand. Do you think that instead of starting at 35, if you would have started at 15, do you think you would be more like smoother at the table? I don't know. When I started out, I caught, I got lucky several times. My second arm wrestling group was the group in South Carolina. They were all national level people. They taught me a lot. Chet Silvers, Matt Harris, and...
Todd Hutchings: What's the other guy? Fritz? Fritz Corey, Chad Silvers, Matt Harris. They were all very dedicated, just really focused. So they were really focused on winning matches, not just getting better. So their practices were very structured and very hard. I met a great powerlifter named Mask Bartley.
Todd Hutchings: in south carolina and he's the one that turned me on to the west side barbell system about how to actually get stronger and know you're getting stronger and then a few years after that you know i moved out and i was training with john brazine so i couldn't have gotten yeah had i done all that at 15
Engin Terzi: I would have been awesome. But if I started at 15 with none of that, I'd probably be better off than anybody else. The fact that I was 35. So you had your advantages and disadvantages. Yeah. Yeah. The group that you were training was one of the best team at that time at the Nationals. Yeah. And then about the powerlifting coach, I don't know him, but also being a training partner with John also probably helped you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I think I'm better off starting at 35 and getting those three things right rather than starting earlier and having to make it all up myself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that's scary, you know, because that is not how it should be. What are you now, 57, 58? 58 for the next three months. And then it is still going up like this. It is scary, yeah. Wait to see me next year, boss.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, it is scary, yeah. And the thing is that you are doing all this at the hardest era of arm wrestling. Yeah, yeah, it's a great time for sure. Yeah, Neil Pickup calls it Jurassic Park, you know, at least for the stage, yeah. And yeah, so yeah. And anyone else that you would like to pull? Arsen you also curious about Petrenko?
Todd Hutchings: yeah either this way class to the next one oh you mean in the 95 kilo right 95 or 105 wherever yeah i'm not that i'm not i'm not that worried about individual people as long as i know who it is ahead of time you know so i mean 10 years from now nobody's going to remember you know your legacy is whether you were champ or not champ not who you'd be getting there so hmm yeah but some people remember some of those unforgettable matches were you
Engin Terzi: Like, did you watch, did you have a chance to watch Laletin versus Morozov match? Parts of it. I haven't watched all of it. It was incredible. It was, it was. I thought Morozov was going to win that, but Vitaly did a very good job. Morozov got injured in round one or round two. Still did very good, but there is no excuse. Laletin also puts so much heart in it. I would never expect Laletin to beat Morozov with that risk, but that just happened, you know.
Engin Terzi: Therrien is something that I, I also learned something that they, you know, here and yeah. Okay. So, um, I also want you to try, do you know Petromar Harins? Not right now. You know, the guy that in Moldova, 2008, when he beat Revas, he beat John, he beat Andrei and he also beat Nugo. Okay. He hook him and beat him. And he also pull against, uh,
Engin Terzi: Zurab Taverize, and that one he won comfortably. Yeah, I think he versus you would be very good match, very good match at 105. Yeah. Okay, set it up. Yeah, yeah, I will, I will, I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You are just waiting there, probably with your board, you know, all the plans, you know, what to do. Yeah, yeah, that is the respect I have for you because of that, that was analyzing, you know. And...
Engin Terzi: so we have an upcoming event and there we will have matches and did you see today i i just said yannis versus mindagas i just saw that before i clicked over to hit this link so i just saw the picture um but i didn't get to read much about it but i saw the picture happening yeah are you are you familiar with both guys i know mindagas a little bit i've known yannis
Todd Hutchings: for a long time. Janis recently posted a picture of both of us at Zloty, which might have been 20 years ago. We were both little. Janis was like half the size he is now, and I was like a third the size I am now. Yeah. So any opinion about that one?
Engin Terzi: It's hard to bet. It's hard to go against Giannis. Giannis is one of those guys that can be down to and then come back and completely outclass you the last three rounds. Yeah, yeah. This is a very tough match. But Mindaugas is also very dangerous. Mindaugas not long ago beat Daniel Prokopchuk. Yeah. But he lost against Artur Makaro. So we will see. We will see how that match
Engin Terzi: that their neighbor countries, Lithuania and Latvia. So we can call it the king of the Baltics. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And Sarah versus Jocelyne. Do you know Jocelyne from Canada recently? I've never met her. Beat Sarah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I love Sarah. I've known her for a long time. I think Jocelyne's a pretty strong favorite in that.
Todd Hutchings: Oh, because she's in probably heavier category or? Yeah. And I just think she trains more strength based stuff rather than bodybuilding type stuff. I think Jocelyne's got like an insight on how to get strong and she doesn't worry too much about.
Todd Hutchings: I don't think she does five sets of 20 reps of anything. You know what I mean? I think she does a lot of like heavy singles, heavy doubles, which is how you get strong. I understand. I understand. Yeah. And Devon versus Corey West, left arm? I think Devon's a big, I like Corey and I know him and I know he's strong. I just, there's only a few people in the world that can challenge Devon.
Engin Terzi: you know and i just i just don't think corey's it but it is as long as you mean you mean even with left arm right well the left used to be devin's best and i was just thinking i can't remember the last time he pulled left-handed devin you mean yeah i think he pulled against leonidas he beat him and yeah he he he lost against kamil
Todd Hutchings: And then he beats Andrei and Georgi Tsvetkov, I think, left-handed. Left-handed, yeah. This would be Corey's best chance of beating Devon. I think Devon's the favorite. But, I don't know, that could be 50-50. I mean, if it went 3-0 either way, I wouldn't be surprised. Okay, so you are saying that Corey may lose, but he's still going to win the rounds. Yeah. Why not?
Engin Terzi: Does Corey not pull right-handed anymore? I haven't seen him pull right-handed in like four years. Yeah. I mean, no, I think he has pulled some matches, but for this event, yeah, I think for left arm, I think right arm, because Devon just pulled right arm, so we needed an opponent. Yeah. Yeah. So let's see how it will be, but I wouldn't underestimate Corey. Corey, when he went to
Engin Terzi: strap with uh tobias in atlantic city those two rounds in strap he won easy but because tobias has very strong grip four rounds he was able to control and beat him but i think corey versus devon is gonna go strap yeah i think i i think devon's the favorite but i think it's a
Engin Terzi: 52 48 favorite i don't think it's like 60 40. i think it's like two or three percent one way or another yeah yeah i i also agree i see i mean corey's chance the thing is that i have seen one time corey and paulo was training and paulo was able to take corey's hand and corey just drop
Engin Terzi: and his wrist and then press him very badly if because corey also has very good side pressure if he comes to here with left arm and if his wrist is moving that way if he puts all his body weight it will probably be uh dangerous so but again you know if the match is longer and longer i think it's gonna be in favor of um
Engin Terzi: It's going to be in favor of Devon. Yeah. So let's go to... We'll have a better idea at the press conference. We'll see how Corey stands up at the press conference and then we'll know better. Okay. And that one, I will go last. Dave Chaffee versus Georgi Tsvetkov. I heard that lately Dave is healthier.
Todd Hutchings: this is what he was saying yeah one of the guys i train with goes up and practices with dave once or twice a month um but it's the same story nobody around here can touch dave you know i mean he's so strong yeah uh and georgie oh so it's
Todd Hutchings: A top roll versus whatever Dave does. Dave doesn't really hook. Dave and LeVon have this weird, just strong grizzly bear method. I'm going to pick Dave Chaffee, 55 over 45. Okay. The match is starting ready. And we know that Dave has very strong side move from the start. So Dave moves here.
Todd Hutchings: What is the possibility that Dave is losing the wrist in the halfway? Yeah. It's possible, but Dave's really good in the strap, so if he feels that hand going, he can let go. If I was coaching Dave on that match, I would say get into the straps first, fire backwards, and then do your thing.
Engin Terzi: you know that's how i tell dave to be yeah that match is going to go step anyways for sure well how i see is that dave is going sideways at some point maybe he's losing risk but we have seen against vitality and lamparelli he has this and very strong yeah so then i i kind of see that here will be a battle between uh georgie's defensive top role and
Todd Hutchings: And if it comes to that, I like the press over the top roll. Usually, if the press doesn't pin the top roll, they almost always knock them off the back of the pad. So the press tends to win those either on fouls or through pins. But I haven't seen Jorgi in a while. I mean, I don't know. I assume he's trained and he's getting strong. I like the kid.
Todd Hutchings: yeah i get a feedback on dave about every two weeks somebody comes back and i go so how was dave he goes yeah none of us could touch him i go okay so it's the same yeah and craig tueller versus john karen from canada john is john a top roller
Engin Terzi: I think he's able to do, I think he beat Brandon Assessor lately. And I think he's using very good lately. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know John too much. I see his name and I saw he pulled Artem recently and I see his name pop up a lot. Yeah. I'm going to go with Tullier. So just because I don't know the other guy. Okay. Okay. Yeah. You are interesting. You are very specific about your own thing.
Engin Terzi: while the other things, if it's suddenly, do you need to have some common memory with that person so that you would have? Well, generally speaking, if they beat me, I root for them. If I beat them, I root for them. And if they're American, I root for them. So that's kind of the philosophy I'm going with. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand, I understand, yeah.
Engin Terzi: So especially recently, there is a small beef between Canada and U.S. I see some hockey game or something they are talking, going, yeah, I say out of it, but Recto says, Engin, Hermes will break if they pull top row like you told. Oh, okay, okay, I know what he's saying. The other day, I had Hermes as a guest, and I was saying that
Engin Terzi: no matter if you have wrist or not you can hit that way i said my elbow would be broken if i would do the same thing and the airmaster that his elbow would be the same you know and there is another super super chat vadik flies he says hi todd sorry todd told that he couldn't do anything to brad on practice table does it mean that bacho is stronger than iraqli
Todd Hutchings: That was practice, right? It was practice. The Brad I pulled was a very healthy, barefooted, 250-pound Brad. The Brad I saw in Turkey starved himself for three days and then couldn't make weight. He looked like death warmed over. I'm not so sure Rustem's sister couldn't have beat Brad that day. He looked like hell. Would you say that you couldn't beat Brad in a supermatch?
Todd Hutchings: Oh, in a super match today, I would destroy Brad, you know. No, no, but he bought already. He bought already on the same way, just say 231. I would, I'd have to be the favorite in that, you know, because I mean, I don't know. I don't know how everybody else runs practices in America. The practice is coming to two flavors. We either have full on militant, like ref set ready goes and we hit.
Todd Hutchings: or you kind of grip up you get everything you want and you kind of nod your head and then you go those practices aren't really good for gauging how well you are they're good for gauging your endurance but not your power um that's how we practice at dave morocco's house you know but yeah i couldn't touch i grabbed a hold of brad and he he posted top rolled out of me every single time and you couldn't do your thing you know no no okay
Engin Terzi: Okay, so Matt Mask versus Ongarbaev. Did you know that Ongarbaev had a surgery last summer? I just read that a day or two ago. Yeah, he had a match with Petrenko. Petrenko beat him, and then he sent me even a photo, the piece of bone that they removed from his elbow.
Engin Terzi: yeah and and yeah so now this is his comeback match a lot of people think that ongarve would win but just like when you had a surgery and you're making a comeback that's not always easy you know yeah yeah i think i think anger by him is going to rely on his hand so much that that elbow is really not going to bother him that much and matt hits so violently with the top roll um
Todd Hutchings: I got to get, I got to give anger by the favorite just for containing the hand. And if you usually, if you could stop or control a hand on a top roller, they fade away. I don't see Matt mask dumping his wrist or hitting sideways or hooking. So, and I don't think that surgery hurt anger by his hand at all. As a matter of, he probably trained it the day he got his elbow surgery done. Right. His hand is probably still monstrous. Um,
Engin Terzi: I haven't seen Matt for a while, but if Matt doesn't- You have seen Matt's match against Marcio in Atlantic City? Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, it was domination, yeah. Yeah, but that's a top roller versus a hooker. That's not a top roll versus top- Yeah, Marcio can top roll as well, you know this. Yeah. Yeah, but he tried this, he tried that, he tried everything. Therrien was no lane, yeah.
Todd Hutchings: Yeah. I mean, I hope that I hope Matt wins, but if I had to bet money on it, I would bet anger by him just because his hand just, you know, his hand control so good. Yeah. And his endurance is really good. Now. I don't know what it's like after surgery, but if you've got a really strong hand and a really deep well of endurance, you're going to beat most people. And what do you think about Matt's hands? Matt is out, but he doesn't really,
Todd Hutchings: control you know like when john top rolls he takes your hand with you you know matt hits and it kind of his hand isn't as dominant as like what john does you know so i mean matt forces you to like kind of hold on to him and then so you know you want to be in the straps where if john doesn't want to go into the straps you got to really really work at it but matt can't really keep you out of the straps the matt i pulled not you know i pulled him the wal
Todd Hutchings: 10 years ago, right? So the Matt you're matching up is a completely different person than the one I know. Yeah. What do you think about the Atlas personalities, Ongarbaev and Matt? Matt was saying 10,000 words during the match and Ongarbaev was going to say two. Probably say thank you and please. Two opposite personalities, right?
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Well, it's the same with Devon and Corey West, right? So you've got, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can't, I can't wait. You know, how, how that one will be Corey and Devon. Yeah. And yeah, so Hunter knows is pulling one and all from Singapore, but probably, you know, Hunter, but do you know one from Singapore?
Todd Hutchings: I've seen some of Wallen's matches. I know very little about him. I talked to him in Orlando a little bit. We share a lot of the same friends. But those guys are so unknown to me. It would just be a coin toss on who to pick. I really couldn't. I mean, obviously, I would support the American, but I don't really know either one of them that much. Okay. Let's come to the one that
Engin Terzi: you would have the best idea to talk about. You know which match. What, would you say it out loud? John Brzenk versus Yoshinobu Kanai. And you just pull Yoshinobu. And one question before we go there. Was your shape against Irakli better than your shape against Yoshinobu? A little because Yoshi highlighted
Todd Hutchings: a weakness in my endurance so i was able to you know work on endurance after the yoshi match even though yoshi's that king's move requires a lot more endurance than a top roller would but going into um coming out of the yoshi match my arm was blown up my hand was blowed up coming out of the iraqli match it was just starting to get to get bigger so i i mean when i got out of the the iraqli match i said
Todd Hutchings: I've almost got this arm pump thing figured out. I really don't have any, you know. John, what weight is it? Well, I guess it doesn't matter. John's hand is better than Yoshi's. John will be able to prevent Yoshi from rolling out where I couldn't.
Engin Terzi: Also, John has this ability. Therrien were some moments when you played against Yoshinobu, I saw that you really wanted to even do this. You saw that it was the only lane. I saw you attempted, but I think you didn't do it or you couldn't do it.
Engin Terzi: I was also collecting a lot of elbow fouls, so I was real nervous anytime my elbow got near the edge of the pad. Because you could jump like that, yeah. Well, John's arms longer, so John can stay in the pad and his hand reaches farther across the table than I do. For me to really get onto Yoshi's hand... Also, you are not there. I don't remember you doing any shoulder pressure against anyone, while John probably has done it like a thousand times till today. So those moments that Yoshi stopped you like this,
Todd Hutchings: were perfect for john's shoulder pressure yeah but can john bring the match there i i think he can get it john's got to be able to pull a match longer than 30 or 40 seconds you know he uh iraqli wore him out um who else gave him fits that other hooker was it not zarab some was it anger value somebody i don't know when john gets into endurance trouble
Todd Hutchings: You know, he just fades quickly. And a King's move, a King's move makes for long matches. But what John's good at is preventing it from Yoshi even getting into that King's move. You know, John might be able to just grab Yoshi's hand and not let him lean back into it and just keep the match on his side of the pegs, you know, up here at 10 to 12 o'clock. And John's hand is completely different. John will pull Yoshi 100% different than I would.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And, yeah, we will see. I mean, if John wants to win that super match, each match shouldn't be longer than 15 seconds, in my opinion. If he has one more that has you headed, I think that he will be out, you know, yeah. And John's smart enough that when he gets into a long match, he'll sometimes let him go. I somehow still think I can just eke it out, and that's just one less match I got to win.
Engin Terzi: Big Draw Ghost asking a question. Engin, when you talk to John, did he say he's training? Yeah, he said he is training. Yes, he is training. I don't exactly know what his shape is, but we will see. Therrien were some practice matches of his posted where he was holding. He was at a practice recently. I saw him come across Facebook not too long ago. Yeah. John that you pulled in Canada last time, could he beat the Kanai that you pulled?
Todd Hutchings: See, I completely avoided John's hand. So I think John's hand, when John beat Michael Todd, when Michael Todd was at the height of his Kings moving, John shut Michael Todd's hands down up front. And when Devon beat Michael Todd, same way. They grabbed that hand and held him up here. I think John's going to...
Todd Hutchings: determine that match you know between 11 o'clock and one o'clock i don't think john's i don't think yoshi's going to get into a king's move against john i think john's going to prevent yoshi from getting into the king's move and yoshi will get pinned or foul off the front of his pad yeah yeah we will see we will see and we have we have a match ermes gasparini versus levan saginashvili june
Todd Hutchings: And how do you see that one? Do you think that it will be tougher than last time or easier than last time? I think LeVon's going to win, okay? But I am telling you, I am a huge Hermes fan, okay? Why is that? When I saw Hermes practicing for Michael Todd on that broom handle thing, I was going, well, that's kind of weird. I'm not sure. When I saw how well Hermes did,
Todd Hutchings: What did you think about that match? Let's start from there. Michael versus Ermes. What did you think about that match? I don't know if Ermes could have done it any better. I think Ermes went in with a plan. And he had the right plan. And he executed it. I think it was just frustrating to Michael Todd. I mean, I don't want to see Michael Todd lose. But my God, to see somebody deconstruct a...
Todd Hutchings: a Kings move like that was, that was just a thing of beauty. You know, um, I have like way more, what new phones respect for just how smart that Italian is right now. I think that was a, I think that was one of the best. Yeah. Yeah. He also understand from arm wrestling and he applies to table very well. Like almost, almost not almost, but you know, a little bit behind John.
Engin Terzi: but he's still, he can do many things at the table. Very smart. He, he, he arm wrestles, you know, like how to say almost, you can say, you know, that he's, I don't know, I don't want to say something wrong, but just, I can say that he's one of those that are close to
Engin Terzi: john at the table performance the iq and everything you know yeah the way that he let it go and he had the confidence you know a moment that he let it go like this you know like like i was like thinking like michael was gonna come up and do this but hermes knew what he was in did you watch the full match there
Todd Hutchings: I didn't watch it there, but I watched it several times. I watched it at my house and I watched it at both practices. So it's just, that is, that will be a class. Whenever somebody talks about the Kings move, they're going to show that match on how to defeat it. That was, that was just beautiful. Okay. And then you were talking about Levan versus Hermes.
Todd Hutchings: You said that Levan is going to win. I think Levan's the favorite, but I think Ermes... I think Ermes is the only person in the world that's got a chance of beating Levan. Okay. I mean, I don't think anybody else in the world even has a shot, you know. So Ermes is the only hope of the humanity against this person who is... And because of that, I would rank Ermes second, not third, just because of that.
Todd Hutchings: uh-huh yeah but for that you know he needs to also beat devon but who knows but you are saying that like he doesn't have at all chance or he has like 20 i'm saying that levon's probably an 80 20 favorite maybe even 90 10. but ermies can do a lot with that 10 percent yeah yeah yeah here's the deal we've i don't know if he's seen levon lose around ever if ermies came in
Todd Hutchings: and won like round one or round two. And then all of a sudden Lavon's back on his heels going, holy shit, I've never got pinned before. I mean, those of us who lose a lot, we're mentally stronger than people who've never lost when they approach their first loss, you know? Yeah. Did you watch that event live or later, Hermes versus Lavon? I watched it later. I didn't watch it live. I watched live and then
Engin Terzi: when when ermes stopped him and he was just going like this i i was like is this real you know i was like like i couldn't believe yeah there are a few matches like that yeah but your match with kanai one of the best matches and the way the way the way that you did all those adjustments to win that did you panic a little bit i started panicking when i started collecting elbow follows
Todd Hutchings: I told, I told Susie, I go, he can't pin me.
Engin Terzi: I'm not getting pinned, but I'm going to lose this on elbow fouls. Whenever you tried to rise, I saw that whenever you tried to rise, your elbow was coming. That's why you get the foul. But when you say that you are not losing by pin, could you pull him like 20 minutes and still not get tired? Because it looks like he was getting tired, right? We were both tired, but he didn't have enough offensive force to ever pin me.
Todd Hutchings: You know, I mean, he could stop me from pinning him, but he couldn't pin me from a Kings move and he couldn't stand up and he couldn't press me. Because if he came my way at all, you know, I could feel I was like on the verge of pinning him. All I needed him was forward just a little bit, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And yeah, but did you get afraid? What if you would gas out first or something during the match?
Todd Hutchings: i was we were both getting tired pretty quickly but i could tell he was getting more tired he was tired quicker than i was you know oh yeah at the end yes but i was just thinking that when you couldn't go like were you thinking that like what if this goes like one more minute and then what if i get gas out you know like this but yeah well i was getting gassed out trying to pin him we could stop i could come to center and rest
Todd Hutchings: you know and i got just enough force to prevent him from knocking me to the losing side i just didn't have enough power to get him all the way down again you know we probably could have i mean if the refs just ignored the fouls and said somebody's you have to pin to win that match might have been 30 minutes long you know oh okay okay okay yeah yeah yeah after the match i went outside
Engin Terzi: And because, like, how good you are, and then this guy is just coming back from retirement, and then he's like, oh, finish. It was my last match. I said, no, you're not going anywhere. You are not. Arsen you crazy? You're coming and giving Tata. Tata, I think, is the best match recently, and then you are talking about, like, quitting. No way. I would just go to Japan and just bring him, you know? We are. Me and Suzy met him and two of his teammates, and we probably spent
Todd Hutchings: two or three hours together afterwards talking and i you know and i said no you can't quit man you're so close i go and we're both at 95 kilograms you know yeah yeah can you believe that one were you like like 96 and a half another one was 97 points you know and he was 97 wearing shoes pants and a jacket
Engin Terzi: So both stripped down, we both could have made 95 then. 95, yes, yes. Or just, you were a little bit heavier than him, right? Little bit. No, no, no. I was a kilogram less than him, but he was wearing more clothes. Because I remember one of you were just a little bit lighter, but I remember this should have been a 95-kilo match, yeah? Yeah. Yeah, I remember. Do you think that this guy, if he gets stronger,
Engin Terzi: like how do you think he would do against other other 95 kilo guys like do you think that he versus Irakli would be very good match he versus Petrenko would be very good match Yoshi versus Irakli I think Yoshi's a heavy favorite there Petrenko
Engin Terzi: i think petrenko is one of the best well-rounded arm wrestlers currently competing i don't you know i i i'll probably pick petrenko over everybody okay can i try to change your mind about directly versus yoshi you're the boss no no i cannot what is both but just like whenever like is it how hard it is to bring yoshi to till here like him like halfway down how hard
Engin Terzi: Yoshi will give you all of that. Yeah, but just think about Irakli's shoulder pressure that you experienced recently. Because you were so smart. Once Irakli beat you once like that, you tried to keep him this way from the center so he couldn't go there. But if Irakli would catch you there, probably he would press you again if you were a little bit in the losing position. So you are saying that Yoshi would give him here. And if Irakli is there, I think Irakli is very strong.
Todd Hutchings: shoulder pressure if he catches him in a losing position. Arakli's press is great. Yoshi will give you this much, but it's not in line with the pegs. Every degree he goes down this way, he comes back. Arakli is going to be able to have to press him four or five inches on the other side of the pegs. Yeah, but have you ever seen Jones' matches against Kanaya before?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I've watched all of those. Yeah, yeah. You know that usually John finishes like this. He brings, brings, and then finishes with shoulder. So he's great, but we can't say that they show. And I think Irakli is taller than John. His reach will be also better. I think he's about, what, 6'3", or something he is, like 191 centimeter or something.
Todd Hutchings: If I was coaching Iraqli, I would say keep the match on your side of the pegs, whatever you have to do. I don't think Iraqli is going to be super offensive against Iraqli. I don't think Yoshi is going to be offensive against Iraqli. So Iraqli can back off that a little bit and just concentrate on back pressure and try to defuse that King's move by pulling Yoshi so he's across the table and not parallel to the table. But...
Engin Terzi: i don't coach people so but that's what i would tell them yeah yeah yeah i understand but these things are getting more and more beautiful and i think our message is getting to higher levels you know when when athletes from east and west west you know they are meeting often i think we all are learning uh something oh absolutely yeah anyways thought it has been 48 minutes and thank you very much for your time i got two questions before we go
Todd Hutchings: Okay. Well, I got two topics. It might be multiple questions. Okay, good. If you don't mind, boss. What's it about? The first one is the matches. You mentioned you set the matches. Yeah. Tell us how, tell us that process. I mean, do you go into a cave and get a big feather and write on papyrus or do you like discuss it with other people? I have boards on the wall, boards. Okay. And then like, I still keep the one, the
Engin Terzi: Previous event, and then the current event, and then the next event, and I already start making matches. Why are you taking notes? You're trying to take my job? No, no, no. I don't want your job. I want to be employee of the year. I take notes in case I got a follow-up question. Okay, okay. I mean, just I look at, listen, there are so many disadvantages I have.
Engin Terzi: one of them is that when the event is in u.s a lot of athletes cannot get visa still but they hopefully they will but but i have very limited menu and when it is over here i have open buffet you understand it's beautiful you understand and now now uh robert wants to keep the matches to the 10 matches
Engin Terzi: And it is also making things a little bit harder because some people complains it's too long. And there are other problems we have. In some categories, especially 95, 105, 115, there are a lot of Ukrainian and Russian pullers. And I can set them against each other. So I have so many...
Engin Terzi: difficulties, but I still try to make sure that I make the best matchups possible. And yeah. And at the beginning, when I do, when I organized so many matches, people were saying, we will be running out of matches. Why are we setting so many matches? I disagreed because in the past, like top eight and the wild mainly were going circulation, you know, around five, six guys, seven guys, eight guys, whatever it is, you know? So now,
Engin Terzi: When you invite more people, now you are giving, first of all, you are, how to say, you are giving hopes to more athletes, their motivation. If I'm good enough, I will have something to do. And then the other thing is that when you give chances to many athletes, now you don't worry if these athletes are famous or not famous because they are becoming famous. And then the results of the...
Engin Terzi: Current matches are just creating a new story for the future. You understand? Like, we understand because now we saw the matches and now we have better idea what to do the next. You understand? And like a lot of people were thinking that Laletin would kill Morozov, but we saw the match was not like that. I picked Morozov to win that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But what I'm just saying that like a lot of people are missing now. Next event.
Engin Terzi: Ibrahim Sagov is waiting there. Ivan Matushenko is waiting there. Schoolboy is waiting there. Petro Marharin is waiting there. Like a lot of athletes, other athletes. Artur Makarov. I plan to set Artur Makarov versus Daniel Prokopchuk world title for the May event. I plan to set you versus Rustam Babaev. But there are, like, as long as mothers are giving birth to the,
Engin Terzi: Guys, you know, we will have, there will be like, just think about the UFC had different stars 10, 15 years ago, today has a different star. So more you grow, more kids are getting inspired, you understand? And then they are coming for the hope.
Engin Terzi: We will only grow if we just think that, oh, these are the five guys that are the famous ones and let's pull them. This, this, this, like you will end up somewhere. You understand? But now if you make it a global thing, you know, that was my vision about our message. What's the second question? If you don't have any additional. No, no. I just want to follow up. So you do all the matches yourself. You don't review them. You set them. Nobody vetoes it. And you're working on the current plus two more events at a time.
Engin Terzi: For example, I already set the main event of the June event,
Engin Terzi: But I don't have the main event or the main event, but I have some really good matches, you versus Rustam and Daniel versus Artur Makaro. But I have, in my mind, there are other athletes. But to pair them, we will see. I'm just trying to, I will be open with you. I'm just trying to solve the problem with Roberts. I said Roberts, like, athletes are waiting and we need to give them matches, you know. I mean, I understand you want to make it shorter, but like,
Todd Hutchings: You can't, I mean, you, you can't really tell athletes to wait, you know what I'm saying? And the second question. Now this isn't really a question. It's just a statement because I talked to a lot of the English language arm wrestlers. So the events are on Saturday and we start showing up between Tuesday and Wednesday. And Thursday. And Thursday. Yeah. It would.
Todd Hutchings: For myself, for sure, and a lot of the English speakers, it would be great if you would move a lot of the stuff we do on Friday to Thursday. Because it's fine mixing with the fans and stuff when we all like doing that. But Friday before the competition, too many strangers grabbing a hold of me, asking me questions, that kind of, you know, I kind of want to be by myself on Friday. Yeah, but we have the, we have the, we have the, we have the,
Engin Terzi: thursday the the the meet and greet and friday only there is a there is a dinner with with uh only vips yeah and thursday thursday i sign stuff and i do the photos with the vips
Engin Terzi: Friday, I have a dinner, I have a rules meeting and a press conference. Okay, listen, rules meeting we can also do Thursday, no problem. But yes, of course, for me, what the athletes want is just very, very important for me. But press conference has to be day before.
Engin Terzi: That's fine. Yeah. Press conference the day before. Yeah. And, and then the dinner, I don't know, like the, in fact, you know, the agreement that I made with Robert is that my lane is like the rules and the match-ups and some arm wrestling related things while other things, you know, the, the lane of Robert and now Dexter, because
Engin Terzi: I have been doing all this by myself, merchandising this. I'm almost going to have brain bleeding by doing all this right now. Yeah. If I only focus, but right now still transition. Still, I can't be just totally away, you know. That's fine. I'm not complaining. I'm just saying. No, no, no. It's okay. Todd, if you are asking something and if you need something, it is not because you are trying to be problematic. You are just saying that this would be better.
Engin Terzi: And what athletes feel is very important for me. But from other side, it's not my lane right now, that part. But I will talk. I will talk or I will consider and talk with Robert and Dexter. I don't know what they plan. But for me, you know, Todd, like I don't see arm wrestlers, you know, someone who is working and myself who is just, you know, I see like we are all in the same boat. I see myself.
Engin Terzi: as an arm wrestling fan more than an organizer. I see myself as an arm wrestler more than an organizer. Like the last three years I'm doing this, next year you may not see me. Maybe end of this year you may not see me because that is not why I started this, not to become a businessman and make tons of money or something. But it is just like I had to do it during the pandemic, while stopped, while stopped.
Engin Terzi: They make good money. I think you're doing a great job and I hope you make tons of money. Yeah. I mean, I like to, my idea is to grow all together. All together. Athletes, you know, you understand? If athletes are satisfied, it means that, you know, everything is good because we need to be unified until we become a mainstream sport. If we get divided, trust me, those pieces will not make the main event. This is our power. Dave you ever seen the cartoon Voltron or not?
Engin Terzi: When they are like five different lions, they always get beat up. And then when they make a vault run together, they win. You understand? Right now we made a vault run and that's my opinion. I mean, I don't know what you think. Yeah. But yeah. So any other question I can answer? I like to be questioned by someone as intelligent as yourself. I do, but I'll save it for our next podcast. Okay. Okay. Thank you very, very much, Todd. And thanks to everyone who has been watching us.
Engin Terzi: And just keep getting stronger. Keep surprising us. Oh, you'll be so amazed next year. Okay. Take care, Todd. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
