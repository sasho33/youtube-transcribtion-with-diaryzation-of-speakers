SPEAKER_01: yes now i hear you good finally finally you are able to yeah yeah yeah so how are you i'm good how are you good i'm a little bit flustered right now what's that i'm flustered yeah i mean like life is not always easy we have our time so we didn't give up and we made it there we go yeah so
SPEAKER_01: Um, can you tell to people who are now watching us about yourself? When did you meet arm wrestling? How did you meet and when was it? Sure.
SPEAKER_04: So I come from a background of strongman. That is what kind of brought me into strength sports. And back in 2000 and I believe it was 18 or 17, I went to my very first event that I did not participate in up in Thunder Bay, Ontario. And I got to watch arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_04: live for the first time um i was in a very very remote area where there was no team at the time and so when my cousin uh suggested that i join arm wrestling because he is a wafraf he put me in contact with a team in sudbury in order for me to train and learn how to arm wrestle and that is how i found arm wrestling where was it exactly
SPEAKER_04: About 2009 or 2019, sorry. 2009. So do you remember end of it, beginning of it? Yeah. Beginning was November of 2019. Okay. So you are a little bit more than five years. Very new. Yeah. Very new. And I feel like I can't really say five years either because COVID took away at least six months of that. So you can say that actively maybe
SPEAKER_01: Two, three years, maybe four years. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, and okay. So, uh, no disrespect, but I didn't know about you. And then suddenly we heard that someone beats Sarah Beckman and that was last year, last year. When was it exactly? May? May of 2024. Uh huh. Uh huh. And then you beat her and then you took all the.
SPEAKER_01: attention and since then you are going undefeated since that match? Since that match, yeah. Right arm? Right arm, yeah. Yeah, right arm you're within, yeah. And then who did you pull after this? The very following weekend I pulled Heidi Kordner. Only one week later? One week later. Oh, that's just, yeah. On the same arm.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Yeah. Okay. So, and you are from the same team with John? John Perry? Yeah, I have trained with John. I do practice in North Bay, Ontario. I train with John sometimes. Yeah. Okay. So if somebody has been pulling for just say 20 years or 15 years,
SPEAKER_01: there is no guarantee that that person is going to get better, stronger. There is a possibility because of injuries or something, maybe going even down, you know. But in your case, from May to end of March, just say April, almost 11 months, just say, or 10 and a half months. And you have been training. Yes. And so since you are very, very new in the sport,
SPEAKER_04: So that 10, 11 months means a lot. It really does. Okay. So my question is how much do you think did you progress since that time? So just to give a little background to everybody, because I feel like nobody really knows much about me is that I did not train arm wrestling specific before I went up against Sarah Bachman or Heidi Cortner.
SPEAKER_04: So I had a lot of table time. I had a lot of people teaching me how to do the moves. But as far as specifically training arm wrestling within the gym, I only started doing that in about June of 2024. So I have, along with my coach, I have adopted more of a Latvian style of training. So that I think is going to
SPEAKER_01: help me in this next match and it's going to make me more versatile as an athlete and train the things that were weaknesses. Yeah, I understand. Okay. Did you watch the podcast with Sara that I did? I did. No, I didn't have a chance. It's been a very busy week. Okay. Okay. She said, I asked her her winning chance in percentage and
SPEAKER_04: What did you think she said? I think she probably thinks she's going to win. How many? Maybe 75-25. No, she said 100%. Oh, okay. And what is your opinion? My opinion is that I think it would be a very big mistake and it would be a repeated mistake on Sarah Bachman's part to think that I'm coming in blind.
SPEAKER_04: She made that mistake once and so I would hope that she wouldn't make that mistake again. Why would you hope? I would hope that she'd come in and take me seriously.
SPEAKER_04: Because compared to what everybody thinks, Sarah did do her research on me before the round robin. So if we're interested in that, at the press conference, we were asked the question of who we were most excited to arm wrestle. And she had mentioned myself and the fact that I had a bench press that was 315 pounds. So she had done her research on me. And I guess...
SPEAKER_01: Based on what I have been hearing, the rumblings, everybody believes that my win on Sarah is a fluke. What do you mean? Maybe some people think that, listen, if you are Sarah Beckman, if you are going to the competition that you were part of it, it is normal for her to underestimate.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, absolutely. But your win is 100% fair, square and well deserved. Nobody can deny that. But do you expect her to come this time stronger than last time? And I know that you are stronger as well, as I mentioned at the beginning of our podcast. Yeah, I expect her to hit in a different area. I do not expect her to fall into a hook this time around.
SPEAKER_04: Because when she hit in the round robin, she hit right into a sweet spot for me that is very comfortable. She hit inside? She hit inside, which is very comfortable for me. Okay. So I don't think she'll make that mistake again. She said that she's ready for that too. That's what she said. And do you think that
SPEAKER_01: There are a lot of information going between the girls from Sweden right now.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, I'm sure there is. There is? I'm sure there is. But, and I do want to clarify this, right? I did lose to Fia on the left arm in June of 2024. And it seems that everybody, that's the match that they seem to remember most of all. But I do want to clarify that my left arm is not my right arm. Even when I'm training it weight wise, there is a 20 to 30 pound difference on some exercises between my right and my left. Okay. So. Okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, okay, because whenever I asked this, they said, they thought that it was the same level, but no, right? No, absolutely not. Okay, because that would really change the things, you know, that would really change the thing if they were the same level. Yeah, but you are saying that your right arm is 20 to 30 pounds, you are saying, you are not saying even 20 to 30%.
SPEAKER_01: 20 to 30 pounds is a huge difference. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just, I have, I am right-handed. I have more dexterity with my right hand and I'm still learning to trust my left hand. Um, if that makes any sense because... No, no, no. It makes, it makes sense. Sometimes, you know, if something is not happening, it's not happening. You know, for some people doing very well, both arms, some people, one arm is much more dominant than the other one. I'm working on it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so you are working for the other one. I'm working on it. Okay, that's good. That's good. That's good. Yeah. And so whenever I asked Sarah, she said, she's gonna win 100%. And whenever I asked you, instead of saying your chances,
SPEAKER_01: You said that it would be a mistake on her part. I understand that, but how do you see your chances? And how much do you think you improved since last year? Like, did you improve 10% in the last 11 months, 10 months? Or more than that? I want to say I've improved at least in the 40% marker. 40%?
SPEAKER_01: I want to say. Yeah. Wow. With arm wrestling specifics. No, no, no. That's what I am asking. Yeah. Yeah. With arm wrestling specifics. Because other ways that you have is probably already you have your own limits, you know, but not in arm wrestling. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and there's still some work to be done with the arm wrestling stuff. I'm not done. I'm still relatively new to the sport. There's a lot to learn. There's a lot to navigate. But I think that I have made pretty significant gains to put my chances up there to go against Sarah in a best three out of five. Wow. That is scary to hear.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, seriously, 40% in arm wrestling specific is a scary thing, you know, because especially when you won last time, yeah, either she needs to hit a different direction. Yeah. And even then, if we think that, you know, if she was better in that direction, she said that you guys pull after the event, how did it go? She didn't really mention how it went.
SPEAKER_04: so the first little bit it kind of went the same way because she hit me in the hook area and then she started top rolling um top roll is usually my default but i was working with a lower hand last year than i am this year so i will be fighting at the top um when it comes time so she went outside she was doing better yeah but i was gripping lower right like i've since learned more of a setup um
SPEAKER_04: So you have everything ready, game plan, everything ready? I have a game plan. Okay. Okay. So that after pull kind of was good for you? Yes. Yeah. Losing to Leah was great for me too, because that's what prompted seeking out arm wrestling specific training. And I find it difficult because as a woman, I feel like there's less opportunity. Like if you lose one match, it's done almost. Everybody kind of
SPEAKER_04: looks uh looks elsewhere for the next big thing but um i really feel like because of the lack of time that i've spent in the sport i'm still growing i'm still learning sarah has probably tripled the amount of experience that i do on the table um i think i have i don't know how long she's been arm wrestling for i know she's eight-time world champion but you know four times senior and four times the junior okay okay
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So she's got a ton of experience and by no means do I underestimate her in the least, but I also think that the information I'm getting is very confusing, you know, very confusing. Yeah. Because, because you are saying 11 months, you are training since then you increase your power 40%. You were better than her in hook, but she was able to top roll you. So it is now like three minutes ago. If you ask me, I would just say that I think you are
SPEAKER_01: like heavily favorites, you understand? I'm saying this now because now I don't think that way because now I think it's 50-50 because if after pulls, if she tried to top roll you and if she couldn't, and now you are 40% stronger, then I would just say she cannot as well, you know, right now she cannot do either. It's going to be close. It's going to be close. It's going to be good. Yeah, it's going to be good, yeah. And do you have any,
SPEAKER_01: like goal to become the best in the world? I am planning to go to WAF Worlds this year, so I'm getting a crack at Barbora, whatever way it happens. So you're going to WAF. Okay. I am. Yeah. That's good. Listen, I will tell you something. Yeah. Every time you go to WAF, trust me, you will become like much better.
SPEAKER_01: every time the only reason that these eastern guys are doing better is because every year europeans wow europeans wow and all of them are competing they are learning a lot from each other they fix some mistake they go there and then the other guys are also getting better so they learn something more that competition level is just making them
SPEAKER_01: crazy strong that is why today i i shared the poster i don't know if you saw uh east west world champions yeah when you look at that poster 15 out of 17 champions there except todd and devon all of them are world champions all of them yeah yeah so when you go there trust me you will be much better armless if you just go there yeah every year every year trust me i had seen a comment on the section i think it was on that poster that said um
SPEAKER_04: know there are no world champions in north america or there's very few and i thought what a shame and i was thinking about why that is and i do think that that is a reason is a lot of north americans don't travel um some do i'm not going to discredit the ones that don't but a lot of people pull the same way in north america and so it's very different to grip up with somebody
SPEAKER_01: In Europe, you know, I've had the pleasure of pulling with FIA. I also traveled to Cyprus to pull with a couple of the guys over on that team over there. And it's all very different and it's all been a part of the learning process as well. So you are coming from the, I don't know if I should say strong man or strong woman. Yeah, yeah. I'm okay either way. Yeah, because you said strong man. So I don't mind to say strong man because if you don't mind it, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So what I'm just saying, if there is a world record 400, like people are really targeting 401. Nobody is targeting 500. So that is the competition is really making people like you put your target, you know, or what is best. So if you make your all goal, North America limited, then it is hard to really better yourself. If you realize that the,
SPEAKER_01: World-level competitive athletes from North America are usually those heavier guys. 95, 105 and heavier guys. Because they had more chance in the past to travel here in professional arm wrestling. Professional arm wrestling, same as like past UFC, you know, the bigger guys, there was no weight category. Same as boxing, there was nothing. But later, we saw McGregor, Habib and Mayweather, some lighter guys in the combat sports.
SPEAKER_01: And I hope that arm wrestling will go to that level. But till now, super heavyweights took more attention or the heavier guys took more attention. That is why American guys in heavier categories, they were invited. I'm talking about PL times, you know, and so that is why they were more in that competition with the East. Yeah. So now we are inviting more guys from.
SPEAKER_01: uh, North America. And I think that even those lighter guys will be in the, in the mix, you know? Yeah. That's what I believe. Yeah. So do you, do you follow, do you follow the, um, East versus West events? Do you watch them? You know, like, what do you think about the competition, uh, level? I think one of us had,
SPEAKER_01: internet problem no no don't say that thing there's nothing to joke about that internet problem okay that's probably on her side but anyways
SPEAKER_01: I think she will come back maybe her battery died or yeah she may have popular yeah Makachev
SPEAKER_01: Are you there? Yeah, yeah, yeah. My phone was in the sun, it got too hot. Oh, okay. Okay, yeah. And yeah, so now it's okay? Yes, we're good now. Okay, that's good. That's good. Okay, so what were we talking about last? You're asking me if I was following East versus West? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you think about the level? Yeah, I was just what I was asking you.
SPEAKER_04: i am really enjoying the cards and um i have to say like the last east versus west my favorite match was probably the vitalia morozov match um incredible yeah it was incredible um i'll admit to not knowing very much about the men's arm wrestling just because it's still again a lot of information
SPEAKER_04: Um, so I'm starting to learn them. Uh, I'm more versed in the women's side, if anything else. Um, but I absolutely love the camaraderie on the table. They looked like they were having fun and, uh, you know, the, just, just the wars that were happening was, uh, it was really entertaining to watch and, uh, Yeah. Especially Morozo. Yeah. Morozo was like, he was doing the match. He was screaming.
SPEAKER_01: morozo went to that match like even he was champion a lot of people said that vitale was the real champion but he didn't find opportunity and a lot of people thought that i was trying to protect morozo so he can stay but it was not the case the what was the case that morozo had some elbow issues some some injuries and he said vitali is very strong i promise i'm gonna pull him but just
SPEAKER_01: Give me time so I can pull him when I'm totally healthy. And then at least I can give 100%. And he gave his 100%. And he did his best. He was incredible. Like, I just couldn't believe in my eyes whenever I see that the match stopped, like, that close to the pin pad. Yeah. And then Morozov was just screaming, you know what it means, right? No. Like, like, like.
SPEAKER_01: like, go, you know, he's like, you know, come on, you know, come on. He's goading him on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I know this because I competed WAF for like 25 years from 93 to 2018. So we hear all those things that, you know, those Russian speaking guys are saying to each other. And yeah, it was incredible. Yeah, you're right. You're right. And we have some other matches at the
SPEAKER_01: East versus West 17 in Arlington. And one of them is your friends, John versus Craig. How do you see that match? Let me understand, you know, if you are objective or patriotic or... But it doesn't mean that just because... Realistic. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: You will be realistic. You will be realistic. I will be. So I love both of these guys. John, I have known for about five years now and Craig, I had the opportunity to meet in June in Arizona as well. Both fantastic pullers. I think that we're going to see a pin from each of them. I like the way Neil said that it's,
SPEAKER_04: Experience-wise, it would go to Thule, but heart and endurance-wise, it would maybe go to John. Yeah, Neil said he's more hungry for John. Yeah, I feel like it's going to be a really close match. I want to give the slight edge to Thule. Don't hate me, John. I'm sorry. Let me call him one second. He's pulling it back today. He's busy. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And so, okay. Do you know all the matches, all the athletes? I know them by name, but the only matches I can really comment on are my own John's and maybe Devin's. And how do you see Devin versus Corey? I think it goes in Devin's favor. Okay. And Matt Mask versus Ongarbev. Do you know Ongarbev? Do you know Matt?
SPEAKER_01: I know neither one. You don't know Matt Mask and you're from Canada. And you're an arm wrestler. We've never met. This one I will make a call now. Just wait. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. Wow. Okay. Matt will hear about it. I'm sure he will.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah i saw him at the challenger series and i was very impressed by matt um but i've been told that ungarbaev is an incredible so you know about these people i i know of them but i don't okay no no i thought that you never heard of them and i was like how is it possible you never met them no i never met them okay that's what you are saying but you know there are most abilities okay yes how do you see this match do you have any i want to give the edge to ungarbaev
SPEAKER_01: on that one oh yeah so edge goes to u.s edge goes to kazakhstan over the canadians yes okay okay i'm not saying there's not going to be some good fights in there i really think there will be some really good battles and i think um we're going to be entertained but yes i don't know that it's going to go well but you want you want the canadians to win right
SPEAKER_01: Of course. Of course, yes. In my heart of hearts, this is time for Canada to shine. Okay, yeah. That's what I just wanted you to say that so there won't be any misunderstanding. They won't call you a betrayer or something, you know. That's okay. Yeah. Anyway, so Dave Chaffee versus Giorgis Tvetko. Do you know these guys, about them? No. You don't know?
SPEAKER_01: you don't even know who they are i know who they are i know everybody listen this is what i am asking so i'm not asking you if you know that i'm not so much interested if you know them in person i'm just asking about the prediction parts you know okay yeah i can't make a prediction on that one i'm not oh you cannot okay okay um let's go where we can do more how about john bersing versus can i do you know this guy don't tell me that
SPEAKER_01: you don't know who john is right at least you know who he is yes of course okay okay i think i think everybody in the chat would boo me if i didn't yeah yeah this one they would they would any other one yeah the the math part is not because matt is more popular than john but it's because canadian and popular yes but about john you're talking about like you're talking about i don't know who's the god or uh goto who is the goto uh strongman
SPEAKER_01: Is that not Eddie Hall or Brian Shaw? It's one of the two. I don't know. You know better, right? Are they? It's one of the two, yeah. Okay, okay. So just think about Muhammad Ali of boxing and Michael Jordan of basketball. So John Bersing is the same, yeah. And his opponent is from Japan, Kanai. But yeah, you probably wouldn't know him, about him. Yeah. Before my time.
SPEAKER_01: yeah no he's still pulling but uh he just pulled it east versus 15 against uh tatashins and he gave him very very hard match but i will suggest you something as a friend if you want to become um like best i would uh i would suggest you to watch the the top atlas from past even today their matches not because to know who they are but to
SPEAKER_01: uh analyze you know like their abilities trust me like um i used to live in u.s like six years like from 97 to early 97 to mid 2023 uh 20 sorry 2003. anyway so like there
SPEAKER_01: I had a chance to find at that time, like late nineties, we didn't have a lot of videos on social media about the athletes, but I had some videotapes of especially John Brzenk and I watched him a lot. And just only by watching him, I really improved myself a lot. Yeah. So trust me, watching those athletes will really make you better, you will have
SPEAKER_04: You will have a bigger, how to say, view, I should say, I don't know, perspective. Yeah. I've been focusing more on studying my opponents. So I do watch the YouTube of my opponents, of course, just to see where they're at. So between watching Sarah vs Egle. Were you surprised with that match, with Egle's power? Yes. I would love to take on Egle.
SPEAKER_04: i would love to get on the table with her um i think it's been a mistake on most people's parts to go immediately for gabby that's just my personal feeling about it i'm i'm always honest i'm only going to speak on things that i i know and and can speak on and i think it's a mistake to go straight for gabby instead of building the foundation because then you don't know
SPEAKER_04: You don't know where you rank and you don't know what you need to work on because I think if you take a bite that's so big, you're not even going to know which strength or which weakness to work on in order to come back to that opponent later if they defeat you and then try again. So you are saying that if you beat Sarah, you would like to face Egle next? Yes.
SPEAKER_01: I think that's realistic. I don't know why people don't know a lot about Egle. They go straight to Gabi all the time. She's a legend. I don't think that she ever lost to Gabriela until Gabriela's last few years shape. Before that, she was very dominant. And Gabriela, Egle,
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if you ever heard Irina Makeeva. These are the legends. And Irina Makeeva, especially with right arm, was the best. Better than Egle, better than Gabriela, better than other girls. Left arm, Egle was the best. And later, Gabriela became the best. But before Gabriela became the best, Irina Makeeva, she retired, she quit.
SPEAKER_01: And then Barbara came. She's still very young. The scary part about her is her age. Still in like early twenties, she's that strong. I mean, what's going to happen like five years later? The big problem is it will be from my side to find an opponent for her. Unless you decide to...
SPEAKER_04: make some difference and time will show how good you will become. I think that the open weight women's class needed a shake up and I think too a lot of people see a name and they just think they count themselves out before they even start, right? When I went up against Sarah, I had to take the name away from the person. No disrespect to her, but I would have counted myself out before I'd even started last year. So I think that
SPEAKER_01: It would be, it's interesting. It just, it shows that there's a way in. Yeah, of course. Always. But first of all, you really need to believe and you need to have the capacity. And I believe in mental capacity, even more than the physical one, because I was 16. I couldn't beat my sister or mother in arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_01: People say, oh, you have good genetics. I don't have good genetics. If somebody has really good genetics, at least at that age, you would beat your mother in arm wrestling. You would have something. I don't know if you know about me or something. I used to be an arm wrestler. Yeah, I knew that. You heard about it? Okay, yeah. The thing is that we all have some capacity, potential. It is all about how much
SPEAKER_01: you can come to that level you understand like somebody may have big potential but they can use just say 80 percent of and and your hand your arm is gonna move as here is giving the command you understand so if you are giving the right commands you're building something right yes if here is not that good and you are doing wrong things you know and you are building something not good even though your bones and tendons are strong but like
SPEAKER_01: coordination, the coordination of the muscle groups and the synergy, you know, and then that is making the difference. In my opinion, John Bersink was genetically gifted. And also his coordination of the muscle groups were amazing, incredible. And that is why he was so successful. You know, if I just say,
SPEAKER_01: Did he have the strongest wrist if he would do the dumbbell wrist curl or finger curl or pronation? I mean, he was probably one of the best. I can't say that he was the best about everything. But about coordinating all these muscle groups and bringing out something, you know, as a synergy result, then he was incredible. And anyway, so I think that my opinion, that experience that you are going to have at the WAF,
SPEAKER_01: I think that you will not, you will not forget. And you, and where is the WAFTS here, Bulgaria? Bulgaria, yeah. Bulgaria. Bulgaria is right border with my country. And Bulgaria is a place that like people really goes there. You understand? Like some people, if it is somewhere far or something, some people don't go. But Bulgaria, I think will have one of the toughest events.
SPEAKER_01: Especially there would be a peace in the region, in the more north and east. And then if they also do somehow, if Russian athletes also come, then you will experience something really
SPEAKER_01: uh big you know and you will not forget and i hope that no matter what the result is and i wish you the best but no matter what the result is then i hope that you will continue going there because it is going to make you different arm master trust me yeah yeah i said no matter the result is don't get me wrong you know it is not that easy task to just go there and beat barbara i'm not saying you cannot or something but this is
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, some things need time, you know, like nobody... Okay, there is Jolene Clark. Excited for Jocelyn's future in armwrestling. It is wonderful to watch her to continue to grow and always learning new things. Yeah, I can see that you have a very open mind to learning.
SPEAKER_01: But the most important part is that you have big goals. This is what I realized. Am I saying your name correct, Jocelyn? Jocelyn, yeah. Jocelyn, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see that you don't make anyone big in your head. And even though you don't say it, you have big goals. I do. I don't like to eat humble pie. I know that it tastes better with ketchup. But I would...
SPEAKER_01: I'd like to just show up and talk on the table. I'm not so much a big talker outside of that, but I would rather show up on the table and show you what I can do. Yeah, that's good. We need both of them, especially in the professional arm wrestling. Because somehow drama also sells. But not everyone can do that. Not everyone can do that.
SPEAKER_01: But people like different things, you know, some like this way, some likes the humble guys, you know. But yeah, but if everyone would be the same, then it would be a little bit boring. Absolutely. Yeah. Anyway, so did I miss it or you didn't say, you didn't give me a percentage about you versus Sara? I'll go 50-50.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, you say 50-50. Yeah. I'll go 50-50. I'm going to lowball it. And you say 50-50, and this is what your mind and heart also says, or you prefer to say 50-50? I prefer to say 50-50. My heart and my mind are saying something else. Something else. But let it stay with you. That's what you're saying. Exactly. Okay. Listen, I'm an organizer. I need to stir the pot. I will just try. Yeah. Yeah. I will try. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And so anything else you would like to add? Any message to your opponent? Don't make the same mistake twice. Listen, when you say it this way, I feel like, Sarah, I want you to win. Don't make that mistake. That's how it sounds, you know. Or you are saying, what if she doesn't make the mistake? Does it mean that she's going to win? No.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so in your head, it doesn't matter if she makes a mistake or she doesn't make a mistake. I just don't want to be underestimated a second time. Okay, but even if you are not underestimated, you are saying you are still winning. I think the chances are pretty good in my favor. Okay, okay. See, I'm getting what is here, you know, now. Yeah, yeah. I have visualized, I have manifested, I have practiced, I have...
SPEAKER_01: put in the work and, uh, at the end of the day, we'll see if it's enough. Okay. But, but the thing is that, am I understanding, correct? That you said you did after puberture inside, you were still better, but outside she took your hand and she took your hand and, but in your hand, you feel confident that she can't do that again. Yep. Because like I said, I have learned how to set up at the table.
SPEAKER_04: I am predominantly a top roller. I'm actually not really a hook puller. I can hook, and that's fine. But as far as what we did in after pulls, I was grabbing her low. So you were grabbing her low by trying to hook her? You didn't try top roll? No. Why? I'm still learning. I'm very green in the start. Okay. I understand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And then that after pull, did it make any changes with your preparation for the future? After you come home, did you feel like, oh, I beat Sarah Beckman, I'm good? Or you felt, hmm, after pull she took my hand, I need to do something about it so that maybe someday we meet again so that wouldn't happen? I had a feeling that this match was going to pop up somewhere. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I knew that she wasn't going to let it lie.
SPEAKER_04: And so I was expecting this, uh, this challenge to pop up at some point in time and I have been preparing for it. So whichever way she goes, I will be ready for it. Okay. Another question you said then following week after you beat Sarah, you pulled against Heidi. Heidi Kordner. Yeah. Did you beat her inside or side or outside? How did you beat her?
SPEAKER_04: So Heidi is a very interesting puller because she has trained so she does not get hooked. And so I beat her in the strap on the outside in a top roll. You beat her with top roll you said? Yes. Okay. In the strap in a top roll position. Is that because you choose to go that way or that was the only lane to beat her?
SPEAKER_01: With Heidi, I felt like it was the only lane because she was pulling very well. So you had to also go outside. Exactly. Yeah. And I'm pretty good in the strap. I've learned to use the strap to my advantage. So I was able to show that with the Heidi match. And this was a super match, right, with Heidi? This was, yeah. Best of five. Okay. The question, if I'm not mistaken, Sarah also pulled her, right? At some point a few years ago. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: When you compare, how did you see that? Those two wins? Oh, sorry, go ahead. No, who won more comfortably? Who was more comfortable? Sarah. Oh, she beat Heidi easier than you beat Heidi?
SPEAKER_04: She beat Heidi very easily. I think we were both the same. We went 3-0 for both of us, Heidi. But I found Heidi to be more difficult in the setup. Is it because of... Yeah, because she's tall. She's got a longer lever than Sarah. She's also got a bigger hand than Sarah. How tall is she? 6'2", 6'3"? Yes, 6 feet or 6'1". Okay, and you? I'm about 5'9", 5'10", on a good day.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, so you are not shorty either, you know? No, I'm not. No, you are not. 5'9", 5'10", yeah. Okay, okay. So her arm height, body weight? Yeah. But you didn't have...
SPEAKER_04: that type of problem when you hold Sarah, it doesn't bother you. No, Sarah felt more comfortable than Heidi did. Not to say that Sarah feels comfortable. That's not what I'm saying. Yeah. Talking about the hand and then gripping, you know? Yeah. But Heidi has a bigger hand to start with and a longer lever. Um, plus she's just, she's taller. And I find that with the lever motion, she is, she is masked. She is the master of what she,
SPEAKER_01: Chooses as far as the movement like as the top role like she has mastered that she is very good at it I just managed to find a lane with her. Okay, so you're talking about I'm just So if it was one one week after that it means that like you all your progress about our missing specific 40% is also after Heidi my soul so right now I
SPEAKER_04: If you would pull Heidi, also you are right now even stronger than your previous shape. So I understand. But then I know Heidi trained for Gabriella, right? So I don't know what kind of gains Heidi has made either. That would be interesting to see. But I don't think she is as new as you, right, in arm wrestling?
SPEAKER_01: Oh goodness. No, she's a, she's a veteran in the sport. Like I remember coming into the sport and people were always talking to me about Heidi Cordner. So she's very well known. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So this is what I tried to know. I know she's known, but what I just say that, uh, the possibility of her progress compared to your progress, I was just thinking that since you are much newer, so probably you progress a little bit more than she did. That's fair. That's fair. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Anyways, it was nice to meet you. Nice to meet you as well. Yeah. And I'm very curious about this match. Very, very curious. Yeah. What just the things that the information that you gave and I wish you the best. I also wish Sarah the best and I wish you both healthy preparation and whatever you're going to train after today and
SPEAKER_01: I'm very curious. Let's see how it will be. Any message to your fans? Anyone supports you? Go Canada. What did you say? Go Canada? I said go Canada. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Anyways, Justin, thank you very much one more time. And yeah, good luck to you. Thank you. Have a good day. You too.
