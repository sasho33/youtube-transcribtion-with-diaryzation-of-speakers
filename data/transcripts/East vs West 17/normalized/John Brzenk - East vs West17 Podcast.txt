SPEAKER_02: It's been a really mild winter here in Arizona. It was 80 degrees yesterday, so yeah, beautiful, beautiful mornings. 80 degrees? Isn't it winter there, no? Yeah, well, yeah, we haven't had much of a winter. It's been in the mid to high 70s for the last couple of weeks. In fact, I had to turn the air conditioner on in February a couple of times. That's interesting. It's been crazy. Unlike Utah, huh?
SPEAKER_02: Unlike Utah. Well, Utah's been warm, too. Hasn't been much of a snowmobile season this year. I think I went one time, and the snow was not really that great. Yeah. It's getting warm everywhere. What's going on with you? Exhausted, as always. You got a nice new hoodie there. What are you sporting there? Is that the latest, greatest...
SPEAKER_00: version for this upcoming yeah yeah we had the right one now we have the blue and black one yeah red and black yeah yeah okay yeah you need we need one of them yeah robert baxter better bring one for you too that's right to dallas yeah right probably be a little chilly in dallas so i'll need one yeah yeah yeah so you you usually wake up earlier huh like whenever i send you a message
SPEAKER_02: Like, you know, you are normally sleeping on the WhatsApp and then you see it and then I try to calculate time. So you are getting up like 5 a.m., 6 a.m. or something? Yeah, I get up. My alarm goes off at 4.30 a.m. I'm out the door headed to work around a little after 5. So a lot of times I get texts from you as I'm driving into work. So that's why I don't reply right away. But yeah, no, yeah, you hit me up probably after I've been awake for a half hour. Yeah, yeah. What time do you start working? 8?
SPEAKER_02: Six. So it's about a 20-minute drive into work. But then I've got to park. It's about a five-minute walk from the parking lot. And then we have to go through security every morning. So it depends on the security line. It could take me anywhere from five to 10 to 15 minutes to get through airport security. So it's kind of a pain in the butt, but it's what I got to do.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah i have a question for you do you do you sometimes hide yourself during your training videos hide myself i yeah you know what i mean no no i don't i don't i mean if when i go to practice if somebody asks to uh bring out a camera and if they ask if you know if i mind if uh they they film or video i'm like yeah i'll forward i'm all for it you know yeah i typically you know it's difficult to do
SPEAKER_02: coordinate and do videos of, of my, you know, of myself. So unless somebody is around me that wants, you know, pulls out their phone and we'll do the recording. I, I typically don't go through the, the bother of trying to, you know, set something up to do. I just feel silly. I mean, it's like, you know, my workouts aren't very, um, you know, motivational or inspirational in my opinion. So it's, it's, it would be. What I mean that do you hide yourself? Like,
SPEAKER_02: your form this is this is what i mean no my form my technique no um it's it's it's been very it's nothing that is earth shattering or anything that anybody else does so it's not uh yeah i don't have any weird techniques or things that i do that are secretive by any means so um that's why i kind of keep i don't i don't really throw it out there because i don't think it's really uh you know something that people wouldn't
SPEAKER_00: would learn even from, so. No, what I mean is that like, sometimes I see you during the trainings, sometimes even with the regular guys, and then I'm like, hmm, and then you come and you top roll directly. You know what I mean? Like you, you at the training and you in the competition, like has it always been like this or? Well, no, back,
SPEAKER_02: back in my early years i was a lot more aggressive in my training i could i could arm wrestle a lot harder and i would be um definitely at times a little bit more like i would get my mindset for you know a tournament mindset but lately i mean i just struggle you know i get i get a kick out of it i think i watched um coach ray's uh video on somebody and he says oh age is just a number well
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's kind of true, but it really isn't true. You have to adjust for age. And as I've gotten older, the aches and pains, and unless I'm really prepping, you know, and taking things to keep the inflammation down and to really prep myself, trainings are very different than my aggressiveness and preparation when I'm in a tournament. But in the past, when I wasn't so, you know,
SPEAKER_02: riddled with little aches and pains and arthritis. And just, you know, I would be move a lot quicker, move a lot stronger, move more aggressively. But lately my, my workouts, I have to, I have a really a fine line between. You need to be careful. I gotta be careful. Yeah. No, it's not, it's not like my, the old young version that I could just be super, super aggressive and, and, and, um, just hit everything with, you know, full force and, and, and,
SPEAKER_02: know that i'm safe and i will heal up and get stronger for it now it's so easy to cross the line and then i'm then i'm out of commission for you know a couple weeks and perfect example i pulled pulled a little bit at a tournament on i think saturday night and then we pulled at eric's on tuesday
SPEAKER_02: And I was so, so AP and just so, so sore. And it's like, you know, it's so easy. Twice in three days. Yeah. I was like, I was like crippled. I was like, boy, you know, it just reminded me how important it is for me at my age to, to,
SPEAKER_02: know i've i've been trying to really get ready for this upcoming match with yoshi for the last probably two three months but um i have to really keep myself in check and say okay make sure you're you know being in great shape is is great but being well rested and healed and is way more important than being a little bit better in shape because you know if i feel like i did tuesday when i pulled um i mean
SPEAKER_02: all the great shape, being in the great shape of the world is going to get destroyed because I was just like, I just nothing, the nervous system was just completely destroyed. Once a week is enough. And even once a week, I find myself going, wow, I just can't believe I haven't been able to recover from being aggressive last week. So yeah, for Yoshi, for sure, I will rest at least a full two weeks
SPEAKER_02: My plan is to really start to taper off, even though it's four weeks out, um, maybe get one more, two more arm wrestling workouts in, but they're going to be light arm wrestling workouts instead of aggressive workouts and just try to do more of a blood flow. I mean, I'm not a big weightlifter, but, um, you know, just simple motions and isometrics and just kind of even just pulling against the other arm a little bit to get the blood flow going because.
SPEAKER_02: It's been a struggle. It's a different experience, John. It's a different experience, totally different than what you have experienced during your career. Now you need to adapt. Yeah, I'm trying to navigate and experiment and try to figure out the perfect formula, but it's not easy. It's not what I'm used to doing in the past, so it's been difficult.
SPEAKER_02: Therrien is GB19 is asking, John, we miss you on YouTube. Can you post workouts? Well, I mean, John, do you have workouts except table? Maybe a little bit blood flowing, you know, right? Yeah, no, I mean, you know, most of the time it's just Reagan, the new guy that I have, Reagan, and then maybe Eric will come over. Dustin hasn't come over in quite a while. But, yeah, no, it's normally pretty, you know,
SPEAKER_02: small and private so yeah yeah yeah yeah you remember we were talking about the the the young guy in the hook that 154 guy you were talking about yeah you said that he's very strong yeah he just went there and won the match yeah no no i told you i told you he's no joke i mean i didn't i didn't know who he was pulling against so i couldn't really say oh yeah no he's gonna win or he's gonna lose but i was like
SPEAKER_00: No, you picked the right. You picked a good guy that's, you know, a formidable monster. He's a local monster that hasn't hasn't got out much. Yeah, yeah, so that's how they will grow with the opportunities. Yeah, big grove goal says John since your right shoulder gives you issues. Dave you given any tasks to going hard on the left? You were always very good on the left. Also listen when when when people
SPEAKER_00: when people yeah i'm still here when people were dreaming to be placed top three at the zlotys you were just coming there with left funny that question has come up because um
SPEAKER_02: really quite honestly uh at practices um my left is so much more dominant against guys than my right is if my left is still like i look at my left and it's still so underdeveloped and still a twig um but it it's so much more healed than my right and i can pull like so much more effectively we joke it's like you need to start thinking about doing like super matches for your left arm
SPEAKER_00: I think you can. I think you can. You're probably right. John, I don't think it's about the only age. I think it's about the mileage, mileage on the arm. Just imagine, I always say, you know, on the podcast, like Richard Lapkus and Cliff Dean, Gary Goodrich, Alan Carew, Dennis Siplenko, Travis Devon, Pushkar, you know, do you realize how much pressure you put
SPEAKER_00: you felt, you know. So with left arm, you usually stick to your weight category. I don't think it is as damaged as your right side. Yeah. Yeah. No, the muscle tissue is not
SPEAKER_02: there like i said it it's not very developed but i think the crispness and the lack of achiness and my nervous system for some reason is way more intact i can actually make my left arm move more aggressively than my it's almost like something is shorted out of my right arm that is not allowing the nerves to to properly fire like like they should um but my you know my left
SPEAKER_00: Shoulder also bothers me a little bit. I mean, I have overall arthritis, old age stuff. It's not just completely wear and tear from arm wrestling all the years. So I mean, yeah. I mean, like some people say that, oh, Todd Hutchings is almost also near 60, 58 years old. But he started at 35. So probably you have 25 years more.
SPEAKER_02: mileage on your arm because you are a few years older and you started probably 20 years earlier than he started. And you can't compare apples and oranges. I mean, me at 60 compared to a lot of guys at 60, I feel blessed that I'm still pretty strong and vibrant. So it just depends on the genetics. I mean, I know some 50 year olds that are riddled with
SPEAKER_00: arthritis and just achy and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. So it's, it's just, yeah, it's. Yeah. You know, also what I said, you know, Todd started at 35. So you, you, you have 20 years more damage, you know, and then Todd, yes. He also pulls some of the heavier guys, but John majority of your career, you try to be the best in the world in overall category. You know, those guys that you pull against. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It is what it is. I'm happy. I can't complain. I've had a very long career and I've enjoyed it. Like I said, I've tried to deal with it and try to cope with and figure out and navigate the age thing, but yeah, I'm not complaining. It is what it is. Listen, I know you are always way too humble, but I will ask you something, but I want you to answer me honestly.
SPEAKER_00: Not that you are dishonest, but you are just too humble. You are just too humble sometimes. Do you see any 200-pound guys of today coming near to beating best of Gary Goodrich, best of Richard Lapkus, best of Alan Carrer? Do you see that?
SPEAKER_02: No, I mean, to be quite honest, I think almost in my mind right now, the best 200 pound guy is Todd Hutchins, right? Is there anybody out there that, and Todd Hutchins, even when, I think Todd Hutchins is the best he's ever been currently right now at his age. How is it possible? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know either. It's just, whatever the combination. But I wouldn't put him against, I mean, he's beat Cleve Dean when he was
SPEAKER_02: Not as good as he is right now. He was like very, very... Yeah, no, but still... End of Cleveland, yeah, but still, yeah, he's great, yeah, for sure. Yeah, people underestimate some of the small guys or say they think that they would have absolutely no chance, but...
SPEAKER_02: um surprisingly enough i mean with his style and his technique and what he's doing now with that kind of open wrist pronation uh protecting his hand from being really completely opened up and you know top rolled um he's super effective he's super compact he's super what do you think they're gonna pull now next match against rustam baba well rustam is his
SPEAKER_02: definitely is kryptonite because rustum comes hard so hard on the bicep he doesn't go sideways so much he's so much lat and almost you know sets up high and then he comes so hard crashing down so uh is and i've seen that todd has hutchins is has had the most problem with guys that will do that or will press straight on his bicep you know do the shoulder roll so
SPEAKER_02: He's going to have to figure something out or think about it, but his outside move now might be effective enough to get
SPEAKER_00: Rustem stretched out a little bit, but Rustem's quick and if he gets... Also very strong hand, huh? Strong hand, strong hands. The two guys that, you know, previously Todd lost was two years ago against Prudnik and Prudnik had full cup, you know, and then the other one was Dadikian. So the people who has very strong hand and wrist to control Todd's pronators are the ones that have chance. Anyone who is missing here,
SPEAKER_02: and go into the side pressure. Side pressure. No way. No way. No, I agree. I felt it. It's very difficult. Evgeny though you feel like he got a little bit of a, you know, a spot on his hand and wrist, he got the high ground. It doesn't matter. He's so relentless and strong going sideways. Yeah, I agree. If you overpronate, if you overpronate, you are missing here because you are overpronating. So you need to put pressure here. But when you are overpronating,
SPEAKER_02: Then, then his pronation is also lately very strong. So he's having a little bit, little bit moment here. And then the rest is you need to do as high pressure battle with him, which is not a good idea. It's just too compact. His, his, his build, his structure, even before the surgery, he's just, you know, he's so short forearm. So he's, he's got all the attributes to really stay, stay tight without expending a lot of energy than most. So.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he's surprisingly good, surprisingly strong. Yeah, but I'm super excited for the Rusta match. I'm sure he is too. I'm sure he's probably a little worried because, you know, obviously the last couple of three times it's been not even really much of a match. Rusta's been... And Rusta is looking so strong and so good now. I mean, I think about how...
SPEAKER_02: good Sandras is and how he beat him. I was like, holy moly, that's, you know, he's in good condition now. So Todd will have his work cut out for him for sure. Yeah, there is one super champ. His name is Devon Terzi. And he says, John, will you face the Levan Hulk? You will win. No, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, maybe, maybe 15, 20 years ago, I would have loved to have tested it, but I, you know, I have no idea. He, he looks so incredibly powerful. I, I, in the early years when he first came on, I thought to myself, well, maybe he's like a clean beat and all he's using is his big hand and size to make people feel weak. And if, if you could just cut them down into his wrist, he'd go away. But he's, he's proven me wrong by that by a long shot. Now he's, he's, he's not only.
SPEAKER_02: big and hard to handle because of the size but he's also super strong inside and outside so what did you what did you think about uh michael versus hermes match i knew it was going to be a battle i knew they both were going to surprise each other um i thought i thought hermes pulled perfectly i mean yes you couldn't have i mean hermes is a
SPEAKER_02: freaking smart arm wrestler because everyone he's the last few guys that he's gone up against he's gone in not only just with his dominant strength but really with the perfect talking about the malekin match and michael jerry catarat match the michael match i mean everyone he's like he he's he he also did he almost do you agree that he's one of the guys that
SPEAKER_02: Not at your level, but close to your level about well-runners. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, he definitely takes... He knows the table game, right? Puts some thought into it and looks at his opponent and understands and obviously watches other matches to see and respect...
SPEAKER_02: know what could possibly happen and and yeah he's figured it out i mean like i said the michael match he like i was so just kind of almost laughing he just executed so perfectly um but yeah he did almost exactly what he did to michael yeah he was he waited here waiting here yeah the little experience that i've had playing with michael i i understand that
SPEAKER_02: it's more important to really maintain and stay upright and maintain that cup than it is to attack, attack right, right off the bat. And that's what Ernie's did. He climbed up. Yeah. He made sure that he had everything. And even then it was,
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, very close, very close. I think Michael was at his best game ever. Incredible shame, incredible shame. Yeah, he was huge, John. You should have seen him. Yeah, I saw some of the podcasts or the interviews that he was doing. His right arm was bigger than the other person's body. I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's crazy. In fact, I wasn't sure who was going to win the match. If Hermes made a mistake with the preparation or the performing at the night, he would have lost. That's always going to be in the future, always going to be an entertaining match because it could go either way. I mean, you could replay that a month from now and it could go the other way. They're a good matchup and that's a fun one to watch for sure.
SPEAKER_02: yeah seven came in huge right yes yeah he was huge and he was strong there was no way gonna need to win that match no way you know yeah and did you like the main event match morozov yeah no i i it was incredible yeah yeah two monster sizes like that yeah no it was it was good i mean that when morozov stopped him here i'm not a huge fan of the lefty but i mean
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, I don't really care so much left, right, but his arm, I think he was here like this close.
SPEAKER_00: And then he was like, Dawai Laletin, Dawai. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was thinking to myself, that was what I was telling Todd Hutchins last time we pulled. I was hoping that it wasn't going to backfire. Yeah, it was almost the same thing. But the only difference is that... Devon't be talking shit like that. He might end up not being able to pull it back, right? Yeah, yeah, but listen. Having Laletin in that position and having Tatashi in that position, they're different. If Tatashi brings you to that close,
SPEAKER_00: Very hard to bring it back. Yeah, in such position. Maybe in hook, as Dadikyan did it. Evgeny Dadikyan, I don't know how he lifted him from here and beat him. It was surprising. I think my opinion is that Todd started to do so much pronation, like depending on pulling style. So when you are so much pronating, pronating, pronating,
SPEAKER_00: Trust me, your hook ability is a little bit not that good. Dave Chaffee used to be like this, but now he started doing this, and now your arm doesn't want to put so much pressure here. It wants to...
SPEAKER_02: He wants to more, like, turn back. Well, yeah, and it's obvious, just looking at the, you know, Todd's last match with Irakli and being like this and getting shoulder rolled and his arm went right down. You know, it's a different set of muscles that he's not used to being, you know, hammer curl strength versus his normal, you know, supinated or, you know, side pressure moves. So, yeah, it's...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he, he, he adjusted for it though. I mean, it was, uh, good to see that directly had found a key to open that up. And, uh, and then Todd made sure that that door wasn't open anymore. So that was, it was good. Yeah. Kyle Dykeman or Hermes should have asked Todd, where are you going buddy? Right. And then there is another one.
SPEAKER_00: He didn't drop nearly as bad. I know that they got called a couple times. No, yeah, yeah, yeah. We don't allow. You mean he was like this? Yeah. But here he was like this. Yeah. But he still got called once or twice, didn't he? I know there was a little controversy. At the end. No, I just checked that he showed who was down angle. A little bit, yeah. So there is a super chat. Please ask John Berzing which year he thinks is his best shape on his life and strongest one.
SPEAKER_02: uh i would ask you the better than you do yeah probably you probably would um i mean yeah i mean i was i was actually starting to get really good believe it or not in my uh early early 20s and then i end up throwing my shoulder off throwing that stupid softball which sent me back a year or two so um from age 19 20 21 i was pretty
SPEAKER_02: pretty explosive i didn't look like much but i was pretty damn good and then i hurt myself i hurt my shoulder i was out for almost a year and just never never really got back um slowly got good enough again to be effective but um yeah not probably then probably not until i turned 40 ish 41 42 and i really start you know you know getting a little bigger and and you know
SPEAKER_00: getting stronger instead of being so explosive. John, time to time I look at the superchats, you know, do you mind it? No, no, no, not at all. No, okay, because some people are just trying to, anyway, so I'm not going to say anything bad. I might be off the conversation if I start trying to look at the chance to come across, so I'll let you do that. Yeah, yeah, Aripan is asking, John, who in your opinion has been
SPEAKER_00: has the best chance of defeating Levan in the near future? Yeah, that is a good question. And Kulpunko, please mind your business. Devon't be paranoid. Ermes versus Levan Saginashvili in June. You know, Ermes is one of those guys that knows what he's doing. He may beat or he may not beat Levan, but he sure knows something from the last match. Also, Levan knows it.
SPEAKER_02: do you do you think that something similar or even better Hermes can do it yeah but I think they're both I think they both have more respect for each other now so Hermes will get better will get stronger has a better understanding but also Devon knows now going in to the next match with Hermes that he's no joke I mean he needs to be completely prepared so I'm not sure
SPEAKER_02: how much he took him seriously in the last match. So that would be the important factor. Like, was he kind of, did he go in thinking, Ermes, I'll beat Ermes? You know, not really focused and worried. And this time he will be. So, yeah, it's still going to be a good match. And, you know, of course, Ermes deserves another rematch. I mean, he's shown that he's, you know, one of the very best. He's right up there. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But yeah, other than Hermes, I mean, yeah, obviously Devon came in my mind. He's 300 plus pounds. That might be enough to make the difference. Vitaly, for sure. I mean, just because of his size. Morozov, even. I mean, just because. Do you think that because of his style, Michael? Because it is not...
SPEAKER_02: Like that's easy to flash pin him, you know, you need to really. Well, the problem is though that, I mean, I think Michael could do what even Devon kind of did to him, but can Michael fend off, you know, someone that's even twice as strong as probably Ermias with that shoulder press. I mean, he's, if, if, if he's able to get out on Lavon, Lavon's not gonna, you know, think twice about throwing that, all that body weight and, and,
SPEAKER_02: and doing what he did to Devon, to Mike. So, yeah, I don't know. Do you think that Michael may be stronger than Devon in a defensive position? Yes, I think maybe. It's a possibility. Devon has better hand control. Yeah, just because Devon's built, he's a little bit longer-limbed, so I don't think he's probably going to be able to support as much weight as –
SPEAKER_00: as Mike would. So yeah, no, I would, I would probably say physics wise, uh, yeah, Mike would probably be able to hold up, you know, more, more downward downward pressure than, than Devon would. Yeah. The only problem is that right now, in my opinion, we are in a era of the strongest arm master ever, which is Levan Stagina, in my opinion. And it is not that easy to find opponent for him.
SPEAKER_00: If he doesn't pull so often, people say, oh, why is he not pulling so often? And if he pulls, guys, they are like, oh, he's going to kill him, you know. And what do you want? You know, make your mind up. You want to see this guy or not? These are the best guys we have. These are the best guys out of 8 billion human population. You know, there is nothing you can do. And then one of them eventually, who knows, you know, maybe we'll do something, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Right. No, I agree. I agree with you. You know, most of the matches have to be leading up to who gets the right to pull LeBron. You're right. I mean, you don't just keep putting one after the other up against LeBron, you know, and have them get crushed. That's not, that's not any fun. Twice a year is very good, you know, because he doesn't really have, who do you want me to put him against? You know, like, anyway, so Crick Hollow, Crick, he says, is John interested in a rematch with Ongar Webb?
SPEAKER_02: um probably not probably not um we'll see how uh wild horse does uh matt does against him um but yeah i don't know most of the guys that i thought i wanted to have a rematch of rockley um well patrinko i pulled patrinko again um yeah all those guys i'm pretty satisfied now after being away a little bit that
SPEAKER_02: I'm not really. I mean, I did my best. I got my shot. I feel good about it. Yeah. I mean, on this, if there is one person that doesn't have anything to prove, it's you. Yeah. The latter is big and long to even get my brain thinking about being the guy in that class. So, yeah. At this point, I...
SPEAKER_02: I have no desire to bump my head against top top guys. Yeah, whenever I said Tata Sings vs Kanai match, you said Tata is going to kill him. Yeah, you said he's going to kill him. Were you surprised? Yeah, super surprised.
SPEAKER_02: Well, you told me that Kanai was asking for Devon. I'm like, well, that's ridiculous. I mean, he's been away for so long. Who knows what kind of shape he's going to get a real awakening with Todd Hutchins. Todd's just going to, you know, fling him all over the table. But no, he definitely knew he was in good shape. Did you know that he was 97 kilos only?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think he's the best version that he's ever been. He has to be. Well, he was so light. Yeah. No, he looked incredible shape. I mean, what I remember him, when he came over to the house, he was pudgy, kind of baby face, pudgy guy, you know? At some points, like super heavy. No, he looks lean. He looks in shape. Okay, so question. This guy is probably about near 50 years old.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. And he's coming out of nowhere, suddenly come in and first match point Tatashins who has been killing everyone. Right. And then he is giving the hardest match to Tatashins. How much can we say that arm wrestling today is right here compared to the past or something? I am, you know what I mean? Yeah. But you know, but so yeah, he's a 50 year old, but yeah, he's,
SPEAKER_00: For five years, six years, he hasn't been active and then he just comes and gives Tata things the hardest match in the last 30 years. Yeah, so you're saying that that gives argument to the fact that guys 15, 20, 30 years ago were pretty decent arm wrestlers. Yes, yes, this is what I tried to say. And I agree that the deepness of the competition is now we have more pullers. Yes, of course.
SPEAKER_00: 20 years ago, there was five top guys. Now you can find 10, 12 guys. 100, yes, of course. Yeah, yeah. I agree. But I'm just saying that the guy, the Kanai, I'm not sure if he has ever been the best puller. You understand? But he was, like, very good. He was in the mix, right? Yeah. And he just comes in, Tata Shing smash. Did you realize at one point, Tata couldn't go, and he was, like,
SPEAKER_02: Should I do shoulder pressure? Did you see that? No, no. Kanai's got a big future against, I would love to see Kanai against, directly, against Underbiome. We will see all of them. All of them. For sure. I mean, there are a couple that are for sure. Yeah. And there is another support chat. Engin, do you think, okay, Mikbot is asking,
SPEAKER_02: Do you think in the future West versus West will have a new name as the promotion grows or more contenders or do some region will face each other? I don't think so. It is very good. I've told you this before. I thought, you know, West versus West, ah, that's kind of a, you know, no one's going to understand that, or that's kind of a weird, um, marketing, you know, uh, name to have West versus West. But afterward, after,
SPEAKER_02: Now I think it's brilliant. I get it because you're, you're, you're picking, you're pitting teams, you're picking people to root for the West side. It's just like, you know, our, you know, our, our, and we are not limited there. We are not limited there. We do West versus West matches. We do West versus West matches, but still having that, that.
SPEAKER_00: That side, that divide. Like we versus them type of thing. It really helps the competition level higher. And Gabriel Hernandez, will you be coming to Texas? No, my friends, I won't be coming. So let's talk about the matches. Do you follow the...
SPEAKER_02: I didn't really learn about the card until you just recently released and started throwing pictures out there. I mean, I know you kept it kind of under wraps because of the West versus West 16 we were promoting as soon as they finished. Yeah, I understand that. But yeah, I think I got all, I think I know all the matches now that you got on the card. I will ask you, did you know that next event may be in Kazakhstan?
SPEAKER_00: Ooh, Kydyrgali's area. Yeah, but Kydyrgali is pulling here. I'm not sure if in one and a half months he will be pulling in Kazakhstan as well, but yeah. Okay, let's start when you mentioned Kydyrgali now. Kydyrgali versus Matt Mask. Kydyrgali lost against Petrenko and had an elbow surgery. So they moved a piece of bone this big from his elbow. I think it was broken a piece, yeah. And then he had surgery and after.
SPEAKER_00: It happened last summer. I don't know if it was a result of pulling many years, but after the Petrenko match, he had to have surgery. I almost sent him a match in Tbilisi event, but he said, I better wait a little bit more. I'm not back. So his first match will be against
SPEAKER_02: Matt Mask. And you saw Matt Mask's match against Marcio at the Atlantic City. Matt's looking good. He's looking strong. Matt's one of the most dominant hands. His height is a difficult task. What Matt has lacked is the side pressure, the finishing power.
SPEAKER_02: Mm-hmm . Crittigalli's got a good sticking point, but I'm not sure if he's going to be aggressive enough to really get Matt out of position. I suspect, the way I see it going is Matt will probably get the upper high ground, better position with the hand, maybe not completely top roll him. And then Crittigalli will be patient and try to hang on and hang on and bleed him.
SPEAKER_02: But it all depends on what kind of shape. Do you expect a full hand domination by either of the athletes? I think Matt will probably win that battle. And then he will be trying to hang up? Yeah. I worry sometimes about how strong Matt is even once he gets that advantage. Is he going to have enough?
SPEAKER_02: side pressure because he's he's a big guy, long, long limb. I mean, it's difficult to generate that kind of finishing side pressure when you you've got those big, long levers. But in criticality, we'll battle when he's somewhat out of position and he he does have great endurance. So, yeah, I mean, I think. It's as good as well, who is the guy that Matt pulled up in Canada
SPEAKER_02: Serhii Kalnichenko? Serhii Kalnichenko, yeah. Where do they fall? I mean, Matt was able to... And also, do you think that there will be some negative effects because of the surgery and this is the first comeback match? Yeah, only he knows that. I mean, if it's just pulling out a bone, if it's not actually, you know, an injury, a tendon injury, I mean, you would think that that would heal...
SPEAKER_02: It won't take very long to heal. It shouldn't set him back any. But, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It'll be a good one. Yeah. Well, we were talking about this at practice on Tuesday. Mindaugas, I mean, he was so effective against Samusha. I don't know. I mean, normally I would... No, no, no. They didn't pull against Mindaugas. Samusha didn't pull. Oh, they didn't? No.
SPEAKER_02: Arsen you sure? Yeah. Oh, I thought... Minda was pull and beat Daniel Prokopchuk. Oh, I thought it was Sharmusha that he had the long battle. Oh, okay. That changes my mind. Yeah, yeah. The long battle was Daniel Prokopchuk. I don't know that. I guess I got to go with... I guess I got to go with Giannis. Giannis is so polished and technically perfect. And I just... Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But, yeah, another great match. Maybe I'm wrong. They both are incredible. Maybe I'm wrong, yeah. Yeah, we never know, my friend. Like, you have been pulling for, like, 45 years, more than 45 years. And would you ever imagine Vitaly Laletin to beat Morozov with a deadlift? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there's always surprises. You never know what weird things can happen. And like I said, it's nice when you get to even replay it two or three, four times, best of five, best of seven, because what seems to be such a dominant performance on one side can quickly change with the setup and the endurance factor and this, that, and the other. So it's not always...
SPEAKER_00: How about me losing weight and beating both Giannis and Mindaugas? Right? Therrien you go. Is it possible or too late? Only you know that, but I don't think it's too late. I mean, yeah. Dave you had any experience with Giannis? Dave you pulled him before in the past? What's your confidence level? If you count the rounds, I think I am left and right total like 9-1 against him and against Mindaugas.
SPEAKER_00: 12.1 or 12.2 or something. Wow. So what is their official weight class? 85 kilos? No, theirs is 77. Oh, shit. I didn't know they were that light. Wow. Did you know that when I won the last world title in 2018, it was 143s and I was 44 years old. I lost 20 kilos. Wow. Yeah, I know. That's...
SPEAKER_00: That's hard to do. I mean, you can pull that off when you're younger, but getting up at our age, that might be even dangerous. Yeah, it is dangerous. My immune system is bad because of those weight losses. It's no good. So you are saying that Giannis is maybe slightly favored? I've never pulled with Mendoza. Like I said, my mind was
SPEAKER_02: My argument was different on Tuesday night because I'm thinking, didn't Mindaugas just beat Samusha? Samusha didn't lose anyone in 85. Samusha won 10 straight matches in 85. Because of the fact that I just don't know Mindaugas, I don't know how really strong he is. I do know how strong Giannis is, but he's a safe puller. He's very calculative. He's not
SPEAKER_02: he's not going to aggressively, you know, flash pin them. So I think it'll be definitely a little bit of a chess match, right? Yes. Yes. I see, I see it being kind of stuck and then both looking at each other and trying to figure out how to, how to, you know, get the advantage and where the other out. So it'll be good. It'll be entertaining match. I don't think it's, it's not going to be a, you know, like I think, you know, yeah. Yeah. Therrien's some matches that you just know, just because of the explosivity of the, of the arm wrestlers and it's,
SPEAKER_02: it's, it's a close match, but it's always going to be a boring match because it's going to be either bang or bang. So it's, it's nice to have these guys that are like technicians that are all about also the endurance and the position and, and our art so explosive, like, uh, you know, like David, um, not a con, you know? So it's, it makes for a better match for the spectator for sure. Yes. Yes. Long, long matches. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But somehow his matches are some of the lowest view ones. I don't understand why. He always has wars, and I like that, you know, and some, I don't understand. You're talking about Mindaugas or Giannis? No, I'm talking about Samusha. Oh, Samusha, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Samusha has very long battles. But like last West vs West, no, 15, West vs West 15, his match on YouTube, the full video on my channel, is the lowest view, and I'm like,
SPEAKER_02: I don't understand it. His heart's hanging out there. It's visible that he is just doing a huge effort. So normally that's very entertaining. I agree. And Craig versus John from Canada.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we were just talking about the explosive guys that are boring matches. Craig's one of those guys. I mean, Craig's, I mean, anybody against Craig, it could be boom, boom, boom. Sorry, you're done. You know, go sit down. And I mean, it's, he's that explosive, but if he gets stopped, then.
SPEAKER_02: then it'll be interesting because normally sprinters like that run out of gas real quick, even if they're in fantastic shape. I mean, you're either one or the other. You're out of the blocks super hard. Not really. Sometimes, like, you remember Gaszewski? He was hitting like a lightning, and if he gets stopped, he would pull like... You remember his match with Kanai? It was like six and a half minutes years ago. Oh, really?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you were there as well. In Tahoe, I think. I'll have to look that one up to give me some motivation to maybe give me my brain to think that I have a chance in an actual endurance match with Kanai. I think that, listen, if you want to talk about that one, for me, I saw that because of Kanai pulling open, he was like possible to move here, but he has the luck right here.
SPEAKER_00: But to me, it seems like vulnerable for a good shoulder pressure. Evgeny Todd wanted to do it for a moment, but we have never seen Todd doing that before. And I know that almost every time you beat Kanai in Japan, all those matches, you know, you were finishing him with the push. Yeah, because he is open here. If you pull him, you cannot pull him because he is pulling so good. But if you press him to do where he is going,
SPEAKER_02: then usually you are pressing him. And I don't think that once you press, he was able to resist, you know. Yeah. We'll see if I have that ability. I know, you know, he's probably not the level of Michael Todd, but the last time Mike came on here and did that to me and I tried to press, it was like, oh. Yeah, everything has to be kind of right. I hope I just don't run out of gas before I have the opportunity to try to do that.
SPEAKER_02: Well, my greatest hope is that he just doesn't completely overpower me and pull me across the table where I have, you know, no angle at all to even pretend to try to, you know, throw anything like that in there. I don't think that you should have more than 15, 20 seconds long match with him. Yeah. Any match that you're going to end up with, like Katashin said, you know, I think that it would be best for you. No, no. But then again, like,
SPEAKER_02: Also, I think to myself that I have to be patient like Hermes pulled Michael and I have to stay upright and allow him to kind of pronate out and hopefully into my hand before I make my move to the side and then eventually probably, like you say, shoulder roll. So I don't think I can right off the get-go be aggressive to the side. I think that's... I think that's a little bit complicated.
SPEAKER_02: copying and slowly taking and it's not going and then, and then, yeah. Or just stay completely stoic and upright and hope to absorb and just get a good bow and not really attack, you know, to bend my own wrist back. But we'll see. I'll feel more confident in what I can and can't do when I get gripped up in the match. I really don't even, I would love to be able to come into the match having a little stronger hand
SPEAKER_02: in cup where I don't have to rely on the strap or feel like I can't get a hole in the guy without the strap because I think the strap is also going to give him the advantage. I just haven't really been feeling anything. Would you accept the direct strap if referee asked? No, I don't think that's going to help me. I think I'd need to have at least a chance or two to try to do something with him without the strap. Therrien is one more question. My respect.
SPEAKER_00: to both of you gentlemen good podcast arm fellas thank you thank you my friend yeah okay so uh corey west versus devon left arm whenever i saw them training in atlantic city in earlier fresh once corey was winning and then later i think devon started to stop him um corey's
SPEAKER_00: I think Corey's the best in the United States, right? I mean, who's better than Corey? Yes, best in North America. Yeah, I think so. Unless, like, Devon beats him, you know. The thing is that Devon's, like, with left arm, he has the open arm. If Devon can protect the center, my opinion, he has very good chance of winning. But if his arm is stretching here, I saw one time Corey was training with Paolo.
SPEAKER_02: And he came here and he was losing this and he put to his, you know, yeah. And then, yeah, just boom, you know? Yeah. Because of the way Corey trained and knows and trains with Michael and Michael's strengths, Corey's got an incredibly strong cup and hand and wrist. It's very, very difficult. I think he's better left. I don't know how, how good Michael can give, uh,
SPEAKER_02: Corey, a left arm training. Michael's not on the level. Yeah, left hand. You're right. But yeah, very few people are stronger, in my opinion, than Corey as far as the hand and wrist goes. I mean, he can hang on to some pretty good top rollers and stop them in their tracks. So whether or not he can turn Devon completely inside and then have the arm strength to beat him. With his left arm.
SPEAKER_00: His right arm, he is arm wrestling like this. With left arm, he is more like pronating and going. A little more outside. Yeah, yeah. So my guess is that if he comes and takes the center to the halfway, and here, if Devon is open, then he has his chance to win that way. Yeah, but I don't think that there is another way. I don't see just splash pins him or something. I don't know about that. Yeah, because Devon is also training his left recently. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, no, you're right. Evgeny if he pulls him outside a little bit, Devon will kind of fall into that little Kings move and put a tremendous amount of pressure on your hand and wrist. If Corey can't finish it at that point, it's going to be ugly. It's going to be one of those. Dino is asking, what does John think about Hermes versus Levan? I think you answered that already, but
SPEAKER_02: if you want to say something. I think it's deserving. I think Hermes deserves another shot. You can't go against LeVon. I'm not going to go against LeVon anymore. He's proven to me that he is big, strong, and smart. He doesn't have any holes anywhere in his game, but Hermes is one of the strongest arm wrestlers as far as
SPEAKER_00: it's straight up fair, you know, side of sides, you know. So I think, I think Hermes has, you know, the right to have the next shot against them. Yeah. Did you watch their first match live or later? No, I watched it live. No, I was right there. Yeah. Oh, you were there, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You were pulling Dennis. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I remember now. Yeah. And, and like, were you like,
SPEAKER_00: Is that real? At that moment? I was super excited. I thought, oh my goodness, he's gassing him. He's got him. He's got him. I was there when they were feeding him oxygen. The whole works. And Sarah Bäckman versus Jocelyne from Canada. I don't know if I pronounced her name right, but last year she beat Sarah.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, did she? Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, she beat, and she looks very strong, and we know that Sarah is also a superstar in arm wrestling, and she's looking for... Right-handed? Right-handed, yeah. Right-handed. And she's looking for revenge. Yeah, I can never even really wrap my head around or judge on the women's because, yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay, so... You got Chaffee yet? Dave Chaffee versus...
SPEAKER_02: Georgi Tsvetkov. That is a very interesting match. Dave is looking so like his old self, though. I mean, he's just, I think he's back to his old self, and his hand and wrist are super solid. I think Georgi or Georgi is in trouble. I know he's a big individual. He's hard to get a hold of, but if anybody can get a hold of a tree trunk like that, it'll be Dave. And as long as his hand and wrist holds up, I think
SPEAKER_02: I think it's going to be a bad day for Georgi. So you are saying David's favorites? Oh, I think so. It seems to me that he's back to his old self. I don't know what he would say as far as his ability, but he seems like the last couple of matches I watched, he's high level again. Very high level. Okay. You know, lately, Prudnik hasn't been doing well. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: he is now pulling with left arm against Cody Merritt. Yeah. What do you think about Cody's left arm? Great, superior. Very strong. Just a tad below Corey West. I mean, he's super strong. I mean, hard to get a hold of, great back pressure. But yeah, you know, Evgeny is, you know, once he gets wound in there, if, if,
SPEAKER_02: If Cody can't stretch him out and pin him right away, I think Cody might be in trouble. I have a ton of respect still for Evgeny, even if he's in horrible, horrible shape and not really, you know. He's getting ready. He's getting ready. He doesn't want to lose anymore. Yeah. Yeah. So you are saying 50-50? Yeah, I got a room for my, you know.
SPEAKER_02: my old training partner, Cody Merritt for sure. But, um, I know, I know how good of Guinea is also. So, um, but yeah, I'm, I'm super excited that Cody's getting a chance to pull somebody like that. So, uh, I'll be, I'll be excited to be able to personally watch that one. Yeah. And we have Hunter Knowles versus Wallen Low. Do you know them? I don't.
SPEAKER_00: You know, Hunter, for sure. He was in Orlando event. He beat Doug Ehrlich. These guys are small guys, right? Yeah. Yeah. Therrien is another super chat before we finish. Aaron Gasname. You two are the best. Might be controversial, but
SPEAKER_02: Has John found a gym exercise for arm wrestling that he found actually useful? He says, thank you. Do you think that any of the gym exercises are useful? Oh, yeah. Where do I start? Yeah, I mean, you can find things. I always, especially now that I'm weakest in the area of my shoulders, I would
SPEAKER_02: In my younger years, I would have probably concentrated more on shoulder work, lat work, you know, pulling, lifting, like with the shoulder in the back, hand and wrist, obviously super important. But the devices that, you know, are being sold now with the big handles and the rolling thunders and the hand work that is more concentrated on cupping down or even to the side a little bit are super effective.
SPEAKER_02: I think that's why arm wrestling has probably gotten a little bit better for most because they are able to, if they don't have a lot of good training partners or a good team to help support them get better, they've got devices that do a pretty good job of bringing you into the sport at a higher level than we used to see weightlifters come into the sport of arm wrestling. But still, in my mind,
SPEAKER_02: Therrien's no substitute for arm wrestling. Arm wrestling still for me is the key. I've been struggling with it because I try to step it up and pull a little harder. I know it's effective because at this point in my life, it's so damaging to my whole body. So I know it's so strenuous and it's so aggravating that I don't have that ability to make it work for me to get stronger.
SPEAKER_00: Um, I still would recommend. You've got to, you've got to find other good arm muscles. You have to, you have to build a team, a support group. Yes. Yes. Yes. Great arm muscles. Yes. You can't do it by yourself. I mean, imagine that you, you make a machine that has a brain and hears you, understands you, talks and listens and does pop. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then his hand, his hand and the pronator, all the muscle groups.
SPEAKER_00: That's another human being, you know, who is good at arm wrestling and has good intention. I remember, I think, can we say that Kevin Bungard was one of your best training partners? Oh, yeah. No, he was definitely instrumental in the Utah team. I mean, he helped develop, you know, Jordan Steele, Cody Merritt, Bob Brown, you know, Todd Hodgins there for a while, my brother even. How about 90s? What was the 90s group?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we had we had a dozen guys like Kevin, my brother in 90s. Yes. Yeah. Oh, yeah. But Cody, Robert Baxter. Is it true that your brother stopped training again? Or is just no, I don't I haven't heard from Bill. I don't I highly doubt that he's interested in arm wrestling at this point in his life. But yeah, no, we had we had a great, great group of 1012 guys that were very high level. And we, you know, we all became high level because we
SPEAKER_02: We really want to go back. I don't know if you can go back this far, but do you remember the guy that I used to train with in the mid-80s, Gary Stain? I heard their name from the Arm Band magazines. He took second. In fact, he beat Dave Patton in the first match in the over-the-top final. It was the same weight category? Yeah. 150, 155, whatever that weight category was at the over-the-top.
SPEAKER_02: So yeah, yeah, just goes to show, I mean, if you stick with it and got some good strong arms to arm wrestle on a consistent basis, you can really, you know, up your game quite a bit. And yeah, Gary, yeah, Gary Stane took second over the top.
SPEAKER_02: against a good field, Jerry Janis, Paul Cheney. Yeah. Paul Cheney from Canada, right? Uh-huh, of course, yeah. Yeah. I don't know what he took, third or fourth in that way. Jerry Janis, I think, was also in that mix, but yeah. I heard that Dave Sheffield is 7-5 against Dave Patton, 7, and Jerry won five times against Dave. So they were not like…
SPEAKER_00: I mean, they were very close to each other, you know, those guys. Jerry Catarat? No, no, no, no, no. Dave Patton and Jerry Jennings. Oh, Jerry Jennings, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Another question, like in Richard Lapkus, you know, end of 80s, that he got injured. He got injured against you? Yeah, we pulled a Yukon Jack. And then you hurt your shoulder, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Messed his shoulder up. Yeah. He beat me the first match. I came back and got him out of position a little bit. And he struggled and hurt his shoulder and then bowed out on another tournament. And I don't know how long he was out for. Almost 20 years. I think 2007 Arnold Classic comeback. Yeah. I don't know. But I think he ended up pulling me. I don't know. My memory sucks at it.
SPEAKER_02: remember and you know placing the years in order but um yeah we pulled each other probably four or five different tournaments different times how good do you think he was like like compared to today's guys um his technique was lacking he was he could have been one he put shoulder he was right well he was he was he was 80 i would say an 80 90 weightlifter so he arm wrestled like a weightlifter he was super strong um
SPEAKER_02: doing weird things because of the strength that he just developed with the waist but he didn't really have in my mind a good arm wrestling team to really become a as efficient arm wrestler as he could have been if he he was he was kind of clunky and mechanical he wasn't very fluid he didn't he didn't really know how to hit or transition well he was kind of pretty one-dimensional but
SPEAKER_00: How do you think that he would do the late 80s Richard versus mid-90s Gary Goodrich? Well, I think they had a match or two.
SPEAKER_02: At the end of the 80s, they did it. I think Richard was better. But I think the middle of the 90s, Gary was in his prime. It's hard for me to say who would have come out on top. I almost think that maybe I would have leaned a little bit towards Gary just because he got, you know, to be able to pull Cleve outside like he did at that Union Jack. Gary was...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, his posting strength might have been enough to get Richard out of position. And I think he would have been able to, you know, Gary had tremendous side pressure too. So once he got a little bit stretched out, a little bit of position, he was hard to deal with. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then whenever he was pulling Gary, usually he was holding his thumb, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Can we say that until the end of the Yukon Jack time, Yukon Jack was the toughest event in the world? Yeah, that was the biggest event of the year for sure.
SPEAKER_02: four, five, six qualifiers in different parts of the country. But not only they bought it, but it was also the toughest event, you know. Yeah, the toughest. You know, the best publicity. At that time, it was even harder to win Yukon Jack than winning the Waffles. Yeah, yeah, of course, of course. Because all the pros, you know, they got, you know, it was pretty decent money, you know. Yeah, at that time, $3,500 of that time. Today, probably $6,700. Yeah, exactly. Well, that's six, seven. I think it's more like ten, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay. You know better the inflation over there, but yeah, yeah. Thousand eggs used to be 80 cents. Now they're like $5. Oh, okay. Okay. So, so say like 10, 15,000. Yeah, I understand. Anyways, John, um,
SPEAKER_02: Any other thing that you would like to add before we finish? No, just super excited. Yeah, it's only four short weeks away, right, Texas? I'm looking forward to going back to Texas. Last time I was there, the crowd was just crazy good. Yes, especially at your match. Yeah, no, I mean, it was awesome. So I'm really looking forward to it.
SPEAKER_02: seeing all the the guys in texas and the spectators hopefully it'll be as good if not better than uh florida because florida is awesome yeah i agree and and and you're gonna win i am i'm gonna do my very best i've i've i've been working hard believe it or not to to for this match but it's been a struggle it i'm not gonna lie to you i'm
SPEAKER_02: I doubt myself every week or so thinking, what the hell have I got to do? What am I getting myself into? This is crazy. But I'm going to do my best. That's all I can say. Yeah, that's all we want to hear. Anyways, John, thank you very, very much for your time.
SPEAKER_02: And wish you the best. All right. We'll see you next time. I don't know when we'll see you. If you're not coming to the States here, maybe Kazakhstan. When are you going to do Kazakhstan? I think May 10th or May 17th. That would be too early. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you listen? Do you consider the overseas events more or the American events more?
SPEAKER_02: Because this side of the world also misses you. I do love going. I mean, it is exciting to go, you know, to wherever, outside the States. But it is a lengthy, painful... Yeah, I know. Listen, you're going to pull anytime you want to pull. And again, it's like whatever you want. Like, we are so blessed.
SPEAKER_02: to have you still pulling, like we are so lucky. I mean, I love going to Turkey. I love seeing the international guys out there, but I have to admit it was really exciting and nice to have that support and that backing. In Orlando. Yeah, Orlando is just incredible. So yeah, that's nice. I like that. Yeah. Okay, John, once again, thank you very much and you take care of yourself. All right, Engin. Take care, guys.
SPEAKER_02: Thanks, everybody, for watching. I'm gonna shut this damn thing off.
