SPEAKER_00: Hello, hello, Alex. How are you, my friend? Oh, sorry. I missed it. Hi. It's okay. It's okay. How are you? Wood, good. You? Wood. How is the illness? Still ill or recovered? Today I woke up. I was in the gym. Pretty good. I feel good. Pretty good? Yeah. Just show me some bicep. We are live, by the way. I say bicep, bicep. Come on.
SPEAKER_00: Ah, not bad. No, not bad. Yeah, I think the right is better. Oh, much better. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, it's better. Yeah. Yeah. And very soon, Vitaly will join. And let's see.
SPEAKER_00: I plan to invite many of the athletes for the podcast, even if they are not competing in the next events. And this evening, Neil Pickup will be also my guest.
SPEAKER_01: So how is everything? How did people feel about the event in Georgi? Did people talk a lot over there? Of course, you know, it's like there isn't anything like this here. And everyone's like, oh, you know, it was so cool, so cool. And now that even more matches are coming, everyone is even more interested.
SPEAKER_01: because like let's say levan he's so popular here but sometimes it's not because of arm wrestling because of tv but now it's like more arm wrestling and more arm wrestling and more arm wrestling but levan is usually on tvs because of being the world super heavyweight champion in arm wrestling also i think because of the movie that he was part of it yeah yeah yeah okay until
SPEAKER_01: Until Vitaly comes and let me share. I want to see his match against Hermes so much now. I was waiting for that rematch for so long. Arsen you also a fan of Hermes? Of course. Everyone is a fan of Hermes. Yeah? Of course. That's good.
SPEAKER_01: I think he's an arm wrestle that I maybe the most enjoying to watch. Like how he pulls, how he's always calm. Yeah. Yeah. I must say he deserves the Gladiator nickname. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We will see how the match will be. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think that the event in Tbilisi helped the popularity of armwrestling? Yeah, definitely. That's very good. I'm happy. Armwrestling is growing here and it's beautiful.
SPEAKER_00: When is the nationals, Georgi nationals? Soon, right? I think so. I think so. In like a week. I'm not so sure, but I think like a week or few days. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. What time is it? It's exactly time, you know. And so probably we'll be joining in a second.
SPEAKER_00: I'm interested in what Vitaly thinks about Michael. Because Morozov yesterday was very confident that Vitaly could beat Michael 3-0. I'm not sure if Morozov is objective. I mean, listen. But you know where the thing is? Flash pinning Michael. Can you remind me? Maybe first two rounds of Pushkar match.
SPEAKER_00: you know, in a supermatch. And then the next two matches, he lost. And then last two rounds, he won, but with the... So there is a possibility Vitaly to end up there. And then it may become a nightmare there. You understand? I'm not saying it will happen. Maybe Vitaly is going to pin him. But usually,
SPEAKER_00: when Michael is losing a match, people need to do a lot of adjustments. And then the end is... You cannot pin Michael just right away. You have to really work around it. Maybe he can do it. But we have seen Vitaly Laletin trying to pin someone and not finishing right away. So if that is happening, then it will become a nightmare. If I said this match, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: um so how do you think out of straps because vitality is yeah yes not only long it's strong the grip yeah yeah but whenever i talk with whenever i talk with uh okay just talk about how many times it might lose without someone not allowing him to go to strap
SPEAKER_00: um i think he can always slip i mean yeah but right now he has the guy who has this guy yeah the guy that just came yeah yeah hello hello hello hello how are you good
SPEAKER_01: Wood. And any problem with the arm? It was a long battle. Training. No problem. You already started training. Everything's good.
SPEAKER_00: He said he's a bit late because Zoom was updating for him. Okay, do you guys hear me now? Yep. Yeah, that's good. So how is the feeling to be number one officially in the world?
SPEAKER_03: How do you feel now that you are officially number one in the world? Well, I'll say one thing. I've been waiting for what I've been waiting for for a long time. And so, in principle, nothing has changed in my life. I would like to try to be number one with my right hand and feel if something will change after that or not.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I waited for this for a very long time and it's finally here, but in my life nothing really changed. I really want to try and see how it feels to be a number one on right arm and to see if anything changes if I'm a number one on right arm as well.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Okay. That's the thing that like, I would normally ask him, like, if his challenge with right arm bigger than left arm, but even with left arm, we saw that he was
SPEAKER_01: Very, very hard. Was it harder than he expected? In fact, no. I expected it. I knew it wouldn't be easy for Artem's left hand.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I expected him to be this strong. I didn't expect it to be an easy fight. And I'm pretty sure, like, Morozov's left is better than his right. My left was beat up after Kamil as well. And I just, I knew that people really wanted to see a good match. And we showed them great arm wrestling. Yes, yes, it was, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, anyway, so right now there is a challenge from both sides, from Laletin to Larratt, and from Larratt to Laletin, but Laletin is expecting Devon to pull in May, while Devon says let's pull in August.
SPEAKER_00: And Devon says that you pull Michael first. And Devon is saying that Vitaly is going to lose all Americans, Michael, Devon, and Jerry. What does he think about all this?
SPEAKER_01: You have challenges against each other now. You want to fight Devon, Devon wants to fight you too. You offer more in May, and he goes more in August. He says that you are against all Americans, North Americans, Michael, Jerry. If you fight them, you will lose against them all. What do you think about this? What are your feelings? Devon also said that Devon will win, but he didn't win.
SPEAKER_01: So it doesn't matter what he says, you have to believe in it. You can say a lot, Devon says a lot, but sometimes he doesn't do what he says. You know, Devon said he would beat Levan as well, and we saw how that turned out. You can talk a lot, but until you see it, until it happens and test it, it doesn't matter. You can talk a lot, which he does, but it doesn't always come true. And what does he think that...
SPEAKER_01: Like, is he okay to pull both Michael and Devon back-to-back?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, I would like that. And that's why I want to fight Michael first, and then Devon, because I think Michael is a more problematic athlete for me. And I can give less strength to Devon, because that's enough for them.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I would like to and I would like to pull Michael first because I see him as a more difficult opponent. And I think that when I pull against him and then I go later against Devon, even if I'm not as strong, I will need less strength to actually defeat Devon and Michael because Michael is worse opponent for me. Okay, why would he think that he would be less like strong when he pulled because he is pulling back to back or?
SPEAKER_00: No, he just said that even if. Oh, even if, yeah, okay. Devon doesn't require as much difficulty, yeah. Yeah, okay. So he is saying that Michael is a more difficult opponent than Devon for him. Yeah, okay. And another question. Like, right now, he is the man to pull Levan.
SPEAKER_00: normally so is he risking himself like he had a match in may yeah he's gonna he was gonna pull either devon or michael you know but is he risking yesterday devon made a video he said i am open to pull against you he said but he said if you are planning to pull against levan
SPEAKER_00: just so you know that you are going to lose that chance. By meaning that if you are smart enough, you wouldn't pull against me because I'm gonna be on your way.
SPEAKER_01: and then i'm gonna stop you pulling levan and what does he think about this um
SPEAKER_03: You will fight with me and risk this chance because you will lose against me. And when you lose, you won't be able to fight with Levan. What do you think? I don't worry about that. If I lose to Devon, then I'm definitely weaker than Devon, because Devon loses to Levan. Therrien's nothing special about that. I just want to show that I'm ready to fight with Levan.
SPEAKER_01: I don't see it that way. I'm completely fine with pulling Devon because even if I lose against him, that means I would lose against Levan as well because Levan beats Devon as well. For me, I just want to come out and prove that I will pull and I'm worthy to pull Levan and I'll be good enough. Okay, I understand. But is it a disadvantage for him to pull back-to-back two supermatches or like...
SPEAKER_01: So he prepares to pull in three months, two supermatches? No, I don't see really it as a problem. I don't see myself being weaker because of that. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I understand, yeah. And another question. Michael has stopped all of the guys. He lost some of the super matches, but he stopped everyone at some point. So they had to climb up and then even Pushkar had to do that. And Vitaly is known to be a very explosive puller.
SPEAKER_00: First of all, does he think that Michael can stop him? And if Michael stops him, does he think that he has tools to finish and unlock Michael's difficult game?
SPEAKER_01: When Michael fights, he always stops everyone here. Sometimes he loses matches, but he always stops everyone. Can he stop you because you're such an explosive fighter? And even if he stops you, do you have the tools to change, get in and finish the match, even if he stops you? I'll have the tools for that, but I hope he won't stop me.
SPEAKER_00: no i will have tools to finish him but i just hope and i see that he won't stop me and i'll just finish him i understand so he thinks that he will finish him but if he has the possible i mean if he stops him he will have okay i mean does he trust his dead wrist pressure with right arm
SPEAKER_01: You say you have enough tools. Do you believe in your flop press to finish this match? I know, but I will believe in it. I know, but I will believe in it. Who is left for you?
SPEAKER_03: I don't think there's anyone in the top 115kg category yet. No, over 115kg probably. No one's really left, I think. Over 115kg? I mean, there's no conversation under 115kg. Yeah, but what's the point of leaving someone in the top 115kg category? Well, everyone wants me to compete with many guys.
SPEAKER_03: Many people think that the first person on the left hand is Alizhan. But I don't think that I'm stronger there. Yes, Alizhan is to look at everything. And I don't have such a thing that I have a dream in life to take away Alizhan and prove it to everyone. But this is, again, a human opinion, and everyone wants this fight. Perhaps, I think, it will happen.
SPEAKER_01: You know, everyone wants to see me pull against anyone. Like, let's say Alijan, the name that always comes up first. Everyone wants to see me pull against Alijan. And I don't really, I don't say that, oh, I'm that much stronger, you know, I'll beat him. But everyone really wants to see that match so much. It's just, and I think it's going to happen. And how about Dadikian? How about the super heavyweight Dadikian? Was he impressed by Dadikian's performance against Alex?
SPEAKER_03: Did it surprise you when you fought against Alex Dikan? Yes, it did. But I have a small opinion. If Mengen wants to fight David or Alizhan, I think they should fight each other first. And the strongest among them... The winner. Yes. If you combine the two categories.
SPEAKER_01: I was surprised by him, but I think if you want me to pull Alijan or Tarikyan, you should first make them pull, and then the winner, the stronger man, should pull against me. I think that's a better... It's written on my wall anyways already. Yeah, and if we... Like...
SPEAKER_03: What did he think about Michael vs. Hermes match? Well, I'll say that Hermes was stronger in this fight. And even when we fought with Hermes, Hermes did not surpass me as much in strength as he surpassed Michael this time. But lately I've become stronger.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I think Ermis was like stronger than Michael. And when me and Ermis pulled, I don't think he was that much stronger than me than he was against Michael. Like the gap between me and him was smaller than between him and Michael. And after our match as well, Ermis grew and he became better than he was against me as well. Yeah, but if he grow and he's stronger than his shape against Laletin. So...
SPEAKER_00: Does he not think that, like Michael giving him some difficult time, especially when finishing, like does he think that he may be mistaken about his calculation?
SPEAKER_01: About... against Michael? I'm not saying that Michael is a weak opponent.
SPEAKER_00: No, I don't say that Michael is a weak opponent. I'm just saying that Hermes dealt with him easier than he dealt with me. Yeah. About Hermes to stop Vitaly, yes, I agree. But to finish the match once Hermes is offensive, it was harder. So I can say that...
SPEAKER_00: As a type of puller, he is somewhere between Michael and Lallatin. Not as explosive as Lallatin, but he has stronger finishing power once he puts the shoulder behind. He said that Michael is a more difficult opponent than Devon. If he thinks he can beat Michael without problem, how is it more difficult than Devon?
SPEAKER_01: You say that Michael is more difficult for you to beat than Devon. And even considering this, you still say that you will beat Michael without any problems. How is it possible? I'm not saying that there will be no problems, but I want to win in touch.
SPEAKER_01: no i don't say that i will have no problems but i want to beat him in like in one motion in a flash pin and i'll hope for it and i'll walk forward i mean if you can do that then it won't be so hard that's what i'm saying
SPEAKER_00: We'll see, we'll see. It's hard to say right now, but we'll see. And he said that he has the tools to finish Michael. Like, he says that he can beat Devon 99%. What is the number he's going to give us about Michael? Well, let's take 50-50.
SPEAKER_00: Let's do 50-50. Oh, with Michael? He was saying that he's going to beat him easily and he has tools to finish and now he says 50-50. Okay, let's see how it will be. Let's talk about Devon's argument. He said that he beat Hermes and Hermes beat Vitaly.
SPEAKER_01: Does he think it is the wrong way to calculate things? Devon would beat Hermes, but... No, no, Devon already beat Hermes, and Hermes already beat Laletin, so Devon thinks that... Oh, okay, yeah, yeah. What does he think about this kind of formula? Does it work? Devon, do you know what he says? He already beat Hermes, and his calculation is that he beat Hermes, but Hermes already beat you, so you're not close.
SPEAKER_01: No, I don't think Devon beat Hermes. I think he outsmarted him and basically lied to him. Referees helped him as well. I was there and I saw it.
SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't say that Devon beat Ernest. Okay, and now he's confident that Devon cannot outsmart Vitaly? He knows that perfectly, and that's why all the time that he had an offer to pull me, he always declined.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so he says that Devon knows that Vitaly is going to beat him.
SPEAKER_00: maybe okay okay yeah anyway so we will see we will see we have great great matches coming and so since he's a super heavyweight guy i would like to ask him about the upcoming arlington events which will be a great event and we have dave chaffee versus george swedco how does he see this match
SPEAKER_03: Since you're a heavyweight, let's ask you about the next event in Arlington. Dave Chaffee vs. Tsvetkov. What do you think? How will it go? If Dave will be in the same form in which he fought with me for the first time, and in the second time he fought in the same form. I think Dave will be able to hold him.
SPEAKER_01: I think if Dave is in the shape that he was when he pulled me first and second time, I think that he will be able to hold Tsvetkov long enough. And then how is he going to beat him? This way or he's going to beat him this way?
SPEAKER_00: He will block him, so he will go. He will have to lose his wrist and then come and beat this way. Another question I would like to ask him while we are here. He beat, like he was beating Dave Chaffee 5-0. And then last round, he accepted to go and they went strapped.
SPEAKER_00: And that round he lost. Was it because of the comfort that he had because of winning 5-0? Or Dave was totally different when he was in the Strap? When you fought Dave for the second time, you were already leading 5-0. And you agreed to the last round and you lost that round. I didn't agree to the last round. I offered him to contact me myself. I gave him a full start.
SPEAKER_03: I didn't start. I gave him the start and the center. I just stood and held. He says it was more because you were 5-0. I just wanted to fight Dave. I'm glad he won the 6th round. He deserves it. He's a very strong athlete. And he deserves it.
SPEAKER_01: no i actually asked them to strap me you know i was the one offering it yeah it was because i wanted dave to armrest i i let him i gave him the goal i didn't push him and i just i i felt like he deserved it as an arm wrestle he's a very strong opponent and um he won the way he should have like
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how to explain it exactly, but he was just satisfied the way he won. Dave was strong in armwrestling, that's the lane Dave should win in. Okay, did he try to win that round or no? You know, I tried, but I think if I really wanted to win that round, I would have. Oh, okay. Evgeny with the strap?
SPEAKER_00: Evgeny in the tie? Evgeny in the tie, yes. Okay, okay. So that's what I try to understand here. And now we also have Corey West versus Devon, left arm. I don't know if Devon will be able to cheat.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think Tevin will outsmart him. And what does he exactly mean when he says outsmart him, you know? What exactly do you mean when you say outsmart him?
SPEAKER_03: And he is allowed to do everything. For example, if I behave like this, I will definitely lose by fouls. Judging by the number of fouls that I lose, he is allowed to do all this. And thus, he is loaded with his opponent's capture.
SPEAKER_01: You know, it's definitely set up, the grip, the referees. He's going to argue with referees and they're still going to let him all do the stuff. Because let's say if I try to do it, I'll just lose by fouls. And in the end, I'll lose. And he goes, does all the setup work, loads his opponent, working with him even in the setup, tiring him out. So he believes the referees are favoring him? No, the referees are more inclined towards him.
SPEAKER_01: They don't really warn him. They don't really give him fouls. They don't warn him for how he acts on a table. They can't really stop him. Yeah, but in the last event, there was a complaining in opposite way.
SPEAKER_01: And I kind of agree with that. I think the referees were very strict on Devon and they were less strict on Gennady.
SPEAKER_03: But this time, I could see that Gennady wasn't as strong as Devon, and Devon wasn't really in any danger of getting worked.
SPEAKER_00: You know, I unfortunately couldn't really see the match because I was warming up, preparing for my match. Unfortunately, I couldn't see. I mean, yeah, no, just to say as a friend, you know, like they were strict. On Devon, which I agree, but I don't agree
SPEAKER_00: Like, the referees, like, I mean, like, I should say that referees were not as strict on Gennady. And then I had to get involved. I'm responsible for all this as a referee. I'm not responsible to go and ref, but I also told referees to be strict both sides, you understand? And then there was some complaining about this.
SPEAKER_00: But for this specific case, yeah, I agree about that one, yeah. And there are some other also mistake with some other matches that I also told the referees that they need to be more careful. Anyway, so let's go. So you are saying that without outsmarting,
SPEAKER_03: If Devon can't beat Kody, will he be able to win? Maybe Kody will be able to win, but I don't think he will be able to win against many of the players he won against. First of all, with Hermes. I know how strong Hermes is. He was already morally defeated when he came out to the table.
SPEAKER_01: You know, but maybe Corey can win, but still, like, let's say with Ermes as well, he did, Devon did great against him. He, when Ermes came up to the table, he was already lost in terms of, like, mentally, you know. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: Ok, so let's talk about John Brzenk vs. Yoshinobu Kanai. Did he watch his match, Yoshinobu's match against Todd Hutchings at the West vs. West 15? Did you watch John Brzenk vs. Yoshinobu Kanai? Did he watch his match, Yoshinobu Kanai? Did he watch his match, Yoshinobu Kanai? Did he watch his match, Yoshinobu Kanai? Did he watch his match, Yoshinobu Kanai? Did he watch his match, Yoshinobu Kanai? Did he watch his match, Yoshinobu Kanai? Did he watch his match, Yoshinobu Kanai? Did he watch his match, Yoshinobu Kanai? Did he watch his match, Yoshinobu Kanai? Did he watch his match, Yoshinobu Kanai? Did he watch his match, Yoshinobu Kanai? Did he watch his match, Yoshinobu Kanai? Did he watch his match,
SPEAKER_01: I watched it, and I think it was just this close, very close to actually winning, and he felt just short, you know? Very strong. And what does he think about John Burzling against Kanai? What do you think about John Burzling? I think John Burzling won't fight him. Let's fight, he'll just fight.
SPEAKER_01: No, I don't think John will let him arm wrestle. He will just take his pass. Also, he says that John is going to win? John will win. I think Hutchings, in the beginning, he was playing just a little bit too much. He got too caught up.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. And does he also think that Morozov kind of lost his concentration whenever he made everything show with like saying Davai, Vitaly, Davai. It was beautiful. It was an incredible match. Yeah. But does he think that Morozov also became
SPEAKER_01: When you were fighting, it was an unreal fight, it was the coolest. And at that moment when he stopped and shouted, come on, Vitaly, maybe he felt too comfortable at that moment, this show and all that, and forgot a little? He could only feel comfortable in the first round, and that's exactly how he behaved.
SPEAKER_01: You know, he got very excited in the first round because that's where he felt comfortable. And the way I noticed is during the match, during the round, I was guessing out faster, but when we were resting, I was getting replenished faster as well.
SPEAKER_00: But no disrespect, Vitaly deserves to win that match 100%. Without any doubt, he's the super heavyweight world champion.
SPEAKER_01: No doubt. But does he think that the match could have been harder if Morozov didn't get injured during the match? That's not an excuse, but does he think that it would be tougher till the end? It's without any disrespect, of course. You're number one, you deserved this fight. Do you think it would be harder if Tyoma didn't get injured and the match would be even harder because of that?
SPEAKER_03: No, Artem was injured when the score was 3-2 in this fight. I already felt him in the center. He was already nervous that I was pushing him to the center, although I was standing in the center. I pushed him to the center and with a score of 3-2, his hand was injured. I already felt that I was leading.
SPEAKER_01: No, it happened more of when the score was 3-2, so I don't think so, because in that round, in the 3-2, I could feel that I was just winning Sender and I was just getting through him. And that's where he started to feel, Morozov started to feel uncomfortable about not being able to take Sender in a setup. And after this, I was just... Alex, you were the translator yesterday when Morozov said, didn't Morozov say in the round one and round two this happened?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, round one, round two, and round three, all rounds, he said that it... Yeah, can you remind him that yesterday Artem told us that this happened, first part happened in the round one and the second crack he heard it in the round two, but...
SPEAKER_01: Maybe we misunderstood, but just can you translate to him? I don't know. I heard him crunching it only in the fifth round. I didn't hear anything. If he had crunched it in the first round, it would have already opened. It wouldn't have opened with him. It would have worked.
SPEAKER_01: I heard that it cracked in round 5, before that I didn't hear anything, because if it cracked in round 1, he would have opened up, but he didn't, he was holding. I think he was getting worse, but it's okay, yeah, as I said, tell him that there is no doubt in anybody's mind that Vitaly Valen is the number one in the world, that we are not questioning this, that don't take him wrong, you know, yeah. Just so you don't get it wrong, we're not talking about anything, number one Vitaly Valen is kind of...
SPEAKER_00: No, no, thank you. You did it. We saw you won and we saw and you're the number one. You know, but still, Artem didn't hook me in a single round.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he cannot. Nobody can. Only maybe if he gets so tired. If Vitaly gets so tired. I don't think anyone on this earth can, as of now, hook him in a fresh round. I don't think so. Maybe if you're really into it. But if the first rounds are fresh, I don't think there's anyone on the planet who can hook you in the first rounds when you're fresh.
SPEAKER_00: We asked in the chat for advice for life, not only for armwrestling, but just advice for life from you. Always remain a good, kind person. Always respect your loved ones.
SPEAKER_01: First of all, be yourself and do sports. Always stay kind and a good person. Respect everyone around you and all the relatives to you. And just be kind. Yeah, I like this. And of course, train and be healthy. This is what he said also? Yeah. Yeah, that's good. That's good. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Vitaly. Thank you. And Andrei L.
SPEAKER_00: from Canada says, Engin, are you planning an event in Toronto? I think you can feel a 3000 seats here. If so, Vitaly versus Devon, right? Or Devon versus Artem, left hand, please. Vitaly, who's fan is Canadian. Yeah, it means like, wish you success. You're a fan from Canada.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, my friend, yes, we are planning. We are planning to host one event in Canada, as we did in Georgi. Now, most likely we will be doing in Kazakhstan. And yes, we did in US. And we plan in Switzerland. And we have done in Istanbul and some Kingo table, a lot of Kingo table in
SPEAKER_00: Dubai and now, yes, Canada, yeah. I will be honest with you guys. The biggest problem with organizing events overseas are the visa problems. But we are working on them. And as soon as, like, we have, you know, enough of visa for the top athletes from the West, yeah, we are for sure, for sure it's going to be an event in Canada. But just we need the conditions to be, you know,
SPEAKER_00: like good enough yeah yeah thank you for your super chats anyway so yeah so he he said those matches and so yesterday um i asked okay one more question before that does he think that jerry
SPEAKER_00: Okay, between Jerry, Michael and Devon, stylistically, which one is the worst for him or there is no worst style for him? And another question is that I asked this because Devon claims that all three will beat him.
SPEAKER_01: I think Michael is the most uncomfortable. A lot of people underestimate him. I don't understand how. What were you saying? And because of that, we will start off with Michael.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, so you are starting with the toughest one. And then one more question I would like to ask him. Now we will have Hermes versus Levan in June. The match is going to be less or more difficult than last time? What does he expect?
SPEAKER_03: Now in June, Hermes is fighting with Levan again. As you see, will it be more difficult than it was last time or easier? I think that Hermes was still in better shape when he fought with me. And when he fought with Levan last time, I think that now it will be more difficult for him. But I will still fight for Hermes, because I always fight for the weakest athletes. And it's cool when the weakest wins the strongest.
SPEAKER_01: I think his form against you and Levan was better. Yes, I think so. I think that Ermias' shape for Levan and me was better than he is right now. And I feel like it's going to be a harder match. But I'm still rooting for Ermias because it's always cooler when an underdog wins. It's always more interesting to root. It's very normal that everyone is underdog against Levan.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, guys, the same guys that are saying that Devon cracked Morozov's wrist and the same guys are saying that when Laletin beat Devon in a practice doesn't count. Guys, neither of them counts. Just remember Morozov and Laletin, they did a little bit
SPEAKER_00: table sparing at the end of the West versus West 15. And do you think that that sparing and what actual match look like each other? It doesn't. So just please that Morozov's wrist is cracked or this and that, you know, just like, come on. Yes, seriously. Like I thought that after we organize all these events, you guys
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I'm not saying for everyone, but there is 1-2%. They still don't know the difference between practice and a real match. Sam Siplenko. When is Vitaly planning to beat the 175 kg GM 150 world record set by Nikita Yurkovets? When are you going to beat the record of Yurkovets on the dynamometer? 175 kg. When he beats my record on the right hand, then I will beat him on the left hand.
SPEAKER_01: But I'm still doing armwrestling and I'm investing more in armwrestling than in grip. I'm already the strongest in the world with my right hand. That's enough for me. When he beats my right arm record, I'll beat his left arm record. But right now, that's not really my focus. I'm training for armwrestling. That's my goal. On my right arm, I'm still the number one in terms of the top on the dynamometer. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_00: So he has the right arm record and then the other guy has the left arm one? So officially Vitaly Laletin is the person who has the world record about the grip? Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, there is a question. I'm going to ask him if he will face Devon after Michael this year. Yes, yes, he said that he's going to. Yeah, so Vitaly, so your plan is to beat Michael in May and Devon in August. And then if you beat also Devon after, because you believe that you're going to beat both of them, four months later in December, will you be ready to pull against Devon?
SPEAKER_01: What's your plan now? You're going to win against Michael in May. Then you're going to win against Devon in August. Do you think you'll have enough time to prepare for these four months? I'm going to train with Michael in the fights. I'm going to train with Devon. So I'm going to train all year round.
SPEAKER_01: you know i'll be training whole year because when i pull michael and devon that's my training as well i'll be just saying that that's part of the uh training preparation for levan yeah it's it's a part of preparation for levan okay so
SPEAKER_00: We will see bigger and bigger and stronger Laletin till the December. So Devon is basically making a mistake to pull him three months later than May.
SPEAKER_01: You know, he thinks that he'll get stronger, which he won't, but I will. I'll get stronger. Okay, the question. What is his weight right now? What was his weight against Morozov? And what is he planning to become?
SPEAKER_03: Question. How much do you weigh now? How much did you weigh against Morozov? And what is your goal? How much do you want to be? Against Morozov I was, I think, 143 kilos. Now I'm also 143. My goal is 147-148 to come to Michael. To Devon to come 150.
SPEAKER_01: I was 133 kg around that against Morozov, and I'm still the same weight. No, no, not 133, 143. Oh, 43, 43, sorry, sorry, yeah. 143 for Morozov, and I'm still about the same weight. For Michael, I plan to be 147-148, around that. For Devon, I'll be around 150, and for Levan, I'll be 150-155.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. And what if Hermes wins? If Hermes wins Levan, it means that Hermes is in a shape that like he has never been. If Levan loses to Hermes, Hermes will be in a great shape and in the best shape he has ever been. Then he will definitely want to fight again, but for now he doubts.
SPEAKER_00: Then Hermes will definitely want to pull me because now he is not so sure. Oh, I understand. So Hermes doesn't want to pull Vitaly again. Okay, I understand. And one more time, what does he think Hermes' chance against Levan? Winning chance? 70-70. 70-30.
SPEAKER_00: Vitaly, Devon really respects you, we all know that. Do you feel the same way about him?
SPEAKER_03: I always felt respect for Devon. I respect him very much as a person, as an athlete. I know that he is one at the table, he is the second at the conference, and in life he is a completely different person.
SPEAKER_01: No, I always respected him as an athlete and as a person, always for my life, you know. And I just think that there is one Devon at the armwrestling table, there's another Devon at press conference, and there's a third Devon in real life that is a completely different person. And which one he likes? Who is your favorite of these three Devon? The one who sits at the table for breakfast and talks to you.
SPEAKER_01: the one that is sitting with you at the table and eats breakfast with you and talking with you and the other ones you know if if it's not against me i don't really care but when it's directed at me not really i don't really like it
SPEAKER_00: Aha, okay, I understand. Anyway, so Vitaly, we have been here for almost 50 minutes. Thank you for your time, my friend, and get ready. Most likely, you will be pulling Michael Todd in Kazakhstan, and Devon in August, we will announce the place. But right now, Kazakhstan, you versus Michael, looks like it is like 99% set.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you very much. It's been 50 minutes already. Thank you very much. Get ready well. Be more, stronger. In May, you will fight, most likely, in Kazakhstan with Michael Todd. 99% has already been agreed. And in August with Devon. We haven't decided yet where exactly, but we will announce and find out. Thank you. No problem. Take care. Take care, Vitaly. Thank you very much again. And thank you, Alex. Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Wood luck with the preparation.
