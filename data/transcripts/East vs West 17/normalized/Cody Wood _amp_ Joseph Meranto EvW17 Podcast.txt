SPEAKER_02: Hello. Hello, everyone. Hey. Hello. How are you? Wood. How are you? Wood. Wood. Wood. Can you use your phone sideways? Oh, yes, sir. Yeah. Yeah. Better. Yeah. Yeah. Hello, Cody. How you doing? Can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I hear you. Is the audio fine? Yeah. Yeah. Everything is fine.
SPEAKER_02: So, how are you guys? Pretty good, how are you? Wood, good, good, good. Yeah, let me share the link on social media and then we start. That is a very interesting match. Yeah, it'll be a good one. Yeah, two rising stars from North America. That is for me important because I...
SPEAKER_02: used to live in the US like six, seven years from 97 to 2003. Regularly I was there. Most of the time I was there. And I can say that I learned a lot when I was there. I was competing. And when I was growing, I had those
SPEAKER_02: people that I look up to, like Dave Patton, like Cobra Rose, Jerry Jennings, like a lot of lightweights. And then after some time, like lightweights from North America disappeared, you know. I believe the last guy that won gold at Woff World was Chad Silvers, like back in the 90s, right? Yeah. Like Cobra won 75 kilos, 165 in 2000.
SPEAKER_02: okay in in virginia yeah and so and i remember jerry jenning won in 92 and chet silver's won in 93 as far as i remember so all before we were born yeah substantially before yeah yeah and yeah i think the last guy that meddled for the united states at like 154 and below was vasgen
SPEAKER_00: I think he was the last guy that medaled in like 2013 or 2015 area. Yeah, probably. I know David Stepanian did really well left-hand in WAC. Who did that? David Stepanian. He's like with Vazgen. He's part of the Armenian group in Los Angeles, California. I think he did well, though. He was competing for Armenia, not for America, though. Yeah, yeah. I think he always does. You mean David Egyan, his name?
SPEAKER_02: no we've uh yeah he represented armenia yeah the other guy represented the one that i mentioned represented us but he was in 187. yeah he took second in kazakhstan waffles yeah anyway so i mean so for me it is very important like some lighter guys to be in conversation when we talk about the world level
SPEAKER_02: uh arm wrestling and now like you surprised me joseph like when when i said when we said that match uh you versus kevin palco i didn't know about you and i i mentioned to john and john said that oh this guy is like very tough then then i realized that you know we need to like follow you and then appreciate the opportunity
SPEAKER_02: It looks like you deserve it. And then you beat him. It was a very, very good match. And you beat him, so you...
SPEAKER_02: made another opportunity for yourself not nobody gives anyone a favor for my friend that that especially the east versus west stage if you are competing like most likely you you deserve it and then cody i mean i mentioned many times to you as well that like the things that you had been doing and sharing those videos with those pull-up bars chin up bars however you calling them and i was like wow very strong but whenever i look at you you were coming
SPEAKER_02: little bit behind in armwrestling compared to your physical power and abilities. And now I see that it's paying off. Do you agree with that?
SPEAKER_01: no definitely for a long time i mean i was the slowest guy in arm wrestling every single match was ready goat and if i didn't catch it if i was either getting flash or i'd stop at an inch from the pad and then i'd bring it back and i didn't really know how to arm wrestle now i've got tired of losing and i really studied the sport how to be more technical how to translate the power a lot better so now i pride myself on how well versed i am in the sport rather than just being a strong guy
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I see that. You had the power. You just translate into table, you know, day by day. And I just can't wait, like, the outcome of this match. And how do you guys feel? Like, Joseph, do you feel better than last time we saw you? I do, yeah. I'm never going to go into a match thinking I'm going to lose, you know. And it was a shorter, a short period, like a little prep.
SPEAKER_02: you know um it came up quick but that's why i know cody does the same we just stay ready you know stay as ready as you can be and wait for the opportunities yeah yeah yeah and and now do you guys think that this is going to uh prove who is the number one around that category i i think you guys could like what what can you make the lightest uh joseph like yeah i'm like 154. i can make 154 easy
SPEAKER_01: But Cody, you can't anymore? No, I can still make 154. I made 154 back in December. Oh, okay. Yeah, I can make... That's my preferred class is 154. I'm glad I didn't have to cut to 154 for this one because it'll only be in three weeks notice. But I definitely can make 154. Yeah, so that's the reason that, you know, we decided to do in a higher category. I just didn't want you guys to suffer in the last moment, you know. And so do you guys think that there is...
SPEAKER_00: like another person in the conversation like who could be the best that's the not even or not just the best but up there like that's the thing about arm wrestling it's like there's so many unknowns with people like the one guy we even mentioned uh david the guy represented armenia oh my god he's he's incredible yeah he's incredible yeah yeah absolutely i mean he whooped me in uh 2022
SPEAKER_00: I believe at one of Tim Talmadge's events, Arizona State. I mean, and even I wasn't really ranked until Palco. I was 10.
SPEAKER_02: so it's like it's just getting out there and proving yourself there's so many guys that are insanely strong that haven't really david he had the international experience while you didn't have that kind of experience so more you guys will have this kind of opportunities more i think you will improve yourself and absolutely my plan is to set
SPEAKER_02: you guys the winner of your match against the eastern guy next time you guys have a match you know yeah so this this is most likely a north american qualification for the to face the the an eastern guy and if i don't know who's gonna win between you but do you guys like would prefer to pull 154 next time you know when you're pulling an eastern guy yeah sure
SPEAKER_02: No, no, do you prefer that one or do you prefer this one? Like, I mean, like, which way do you think that you would be? Like, when you pull this category against Eastern, guys, you're going to pull, like, Artur Makarov, Daniil Prokopchuk. Nobody's unbeatable, but are you guys ready for such a challenge or you guys need some time?
SPEAKER_00: Um, I'd rather pull like a world level match at one 54. Cause my, my goal is, um, I want to be a world champion at one 54 and then move to one 65 and then eventually one 76. That's those are my goals. Yeah. Yeah. And, but for, for the same job, one 50. Yeah. Yeah. One 54, super easy for me to make. It's a, it's a competitive class. I enjoy because I'll walk around at one 60. All I gotta do is fast and take a dump and I'm one 54. So it's, you know, it's close for me.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, 154 is good. Yeah, yeah. And how do you guys see your chances against each other? I'm confident. I see he's got the hook lane, which is amazing. But he's got a lot of holes in his game besides that hook lane. And if there is a weakness, I plan to extort it. And you, Joseph?
SPEAKER_00: That's just it, man. Nobody's been able to really find too many weaknesses with Cody. You know, there's not many videos of him losing out there. Therrien's not much for me to go off of, but I'm going to try to make some more. He's very versatile. I know he started in an outside game due to injuries and what have you. I know he went inside and his inside is incredible, too. So he's I have more than my hands full come the 29th. That's for sure. I have a question for you, Joseph.
SPEAKER_02: Just remember the time that you were getting ready to go and face Kevin Palco? I do. Yeah. And now you're going Cody Woodmash. In which one were you more confident before the match? Bruce Kevin. I was more confident. Cody's number one for a reason. You know what I mean?
SPEAKER_00: He's an incredible arm wrestler. I think Kevin and I pull a lot more similar than Cody and I do as well. So I knew it was going to be inside. I think Cody's going to definitely try to top roll me. So it was just I knew where it was going most likely with Kevin. Cody, he's very versatile, so it's different for sure. And Cody, you say you're confident and you are already...
SPEAKER_01: excited for your Eastern opponents? Well, I told myself at the beginning of this year that I'd stop doubting myself. Before any match, I would just completely stop doubting myself because if you doubt yourself, you're setting yourself up for failure. So I told myself that I was just going to
SPEAKER_01: Mask sure that when I'm going into a match, I'm a hundred percent confident, never underestimate anybody. So as soon as I found out that I'm having the match with Joseph, I've studied, I mean, at this point, like I know this demands blood type, I've studied him so hard. So I know exactly where he's going to be strong, exactly where he's going to be weak. So I'm confident leading into the match. I understand. I understand. And do you guys follow these international stage matches? Like West versus West? Yeah. And.
SPEAKER_02: Is it exciting to know that you're going to be there? Yeah, this is the pinnacle. This is your second time, but Cody's first time. Let's see how he will feel. Were you excited? Were you nervous before the Atlantic City event?
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely. You know, and one of the things that makes me the most nervous is the press conferences, it's easy to go out there and arm wrestle. But it's always the press conferences. And you know, those are all the little things leading up to it, the interviews that photoshoots something new or? Yeah, it's unknown, you know, and then you're sitting in a room with LeBron and Devon, it's very different. You know, it's really cool. It's a neat experience. I enjoyed it. It's a lot. And do you plan to experience more?
SPEAKER_01: Absolutely. Okay, cool. I'm in trouble. I'm just trying. Yeah, Joseph, you're 22. Arsen you? Dave you turned 23 yet? I turned 23 last December. Okay, so we are we're, we're both the same age. We're both 23. And I believe you've been in the sport right at five years now. For a little over four, about four and a half. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so I've been in the sport about a year longer than you and we're the same age. So it's going to be interesting. And you know what, Cody? Like 23 years old and we're competing at this. I mean, we're blessed, truly. Definitely. It's an amazing opportunity. Therrien is a provocator in the chat room.
SPEAKER_02: His name is Mindaugas Tarasaitis. Oh, gosh. Do you know what he wrote? He wrote, fresh meat. He sees you guys like prey. He's prey. I bet he does. We'll see. We'll see. Time will show, right? Absolutely. Nobody's safe. Mindaugas can compete at 154, right? Yeah. He won 20-23 in 70 kilo right in left turn, yeah. Okay. Awesome. Yeah. Therrien are superchats.
SPEAKER_02: one is really long name the lucky ones podcast female in our nothing thank you very much for your uh super chat tell cody that jimmy jones is rooting for joseph good luck to cody from the lucky ones better jimmy john sucks
SPEAKER_02: And Jay says, Cody's work ethic is second to none when it comes to achieving his goals. This truth has resigned many arm wrestlers to being simply fans. Yeah, so Cody, you are a teammate with Rambath? Yes, yes, we train together. Lately, what I've been doing is, so we've got practices on Sundays at 2. I don't know if you've heard of Joseph Elliton.
SPEAKER_01: um probably yes but not he he trains with ron i mean he's he'll probably one of the next 220 guys that'll be at east versus west he's a bad dude i mean he's he's gonna be 220 guy yeah he's gonna be one of the guys to watch out for i haven't seen him get stopped in a tournament lately do you guys realize that this this match you between you and joseph has like some different meaning
SPEAKER_02: Do you guys realize? Oh yeah, because the two goats. Because he is training partner with John Brzenk and you are training partner with Ron Beth. And those two are probably the two biggest names in the American armwrestling history. And John is the goat anyways. But John, like Ron Beth, like I'm talking about John's prime, Ron Beth is
SPEAKER_02: The person who is near John's weight, John always competed even the open category supers, but Ranbet, who is around John's weight category, he had probably the most win against John amongst all other arm wrestlers. John has beaten him more, probably if Ran beat him once, John beat him three times.
SPEAKER_01: At those years, around John's weight, nobody could touch him except Ron. It's funny because we were just talking about that with Ron the other day because I was like, Ron, I don't see you really press much anymore. And he's like, well, back in the day, like every time I beat John, it was in a press. And I was like, man, that's such a flex to be able to say every time that I beat John Brzenk. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I wrote this. I used to write articles about arm wrestling and Ron Baird was
SPEAKER_02: John Bersink's toughest opponent around his category. I even knew, but I forgot when I got old, how many times John beat him and how many times Ran beat him. I remember Ran told me that Engin, you know about me more than I know about myself. This is what he told me.
SPEAKER_02: Um, yeah, that, that, that, that is some, some different, you know, like meaning for your match. One is coming from John's team. The other one is coming from Ron's team. You know, it's, it's incredible. Yeah. We will see. Yeah. You will see. And okay. Bob Brown arm wrestling says exciting match. Yeah. It will be, it will be, it will be great. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Bob will be there too, man. He's a good guy. I like Bob. Yes, yes, yes. He's a very respected guy, yeah, in the community. He's one of the few guys in American arm wrestling that's actually genuinely smart on the table rather than just... Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He's awesome. Yeah, let's see. Let's see if we will see. Now we have Hunter also as a lightweight representative. I don't think he will ever make 154 again, but how do you guys see his match against Wallen Low and Mindaugas with left arm? I think Cody Kanitz is a little better.
SPEAKER_01: I think Hunter is going to surprise some people on the left arm. I think a lot of people are doubting his ability on the left. A lot of people don't know that his left is better than his right. And it is going to surprise people. So you are saying Mindaugas will be a fresh meat for him? I've got Hunter winning like 55-45. Wow. Mindaugas being underdog is very, very surprising. The reason I say that is because a lot of guys, they catch Hunter's first hit. They might catch Hunter's first hit.
SPEAKER_01: then that next one is going to be a little soft like hunter's hit never slows down it's gonna be the same speed same power where somebody's arm is gonna get softer and softer and softer so that first one mindy might get something he's gonna elbow foul strategically more than likely hit again different angle because his left can top roll or hook his right just has the hook so he's gonna change his angle how do you know him that well did you guys like have experience with left arm as well or yeah we've pulled left and right in tournament um
SPEAKER_01: The last time... I think he beat Justin Bishop, right? He beat Justin Bishop? Yeah. 2-1, was it tournaments? Yeah, it was a tournament. Okay, yeah. And Justin has a very good left arm. And he's training now, too. He just recently beat Paul Passmore in the overalls left-handed. Justin? Yeah. Oh, okay. So he's definitely strong right now, left-handed. And Hunter was able to pull out the win against him.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Hunter is very explosive and he can also pull long matches as well. Not many people have that ability to be so explosive and also he can lock himself and pull long matches. And how do you see these matches, Joseph? I'm really curious. I know Hunter is a natural lefty, I believe, too.
SPEAKER_00: Which was really incredible for him to go on and become number one right-handed. I don't know too much about Valen Low. He kind of popped up to me whenever I saw the card. I ended up friending him on Facebook, saw some of his stuff. I know he's been around for a while. I was talking to Bob a little bit about him.
SPEAKER_02: But we'll see. I'm curious. Mindaugas is definitely a big ass. So that'll be a very entertaining match to watch. For sure. When you guys look at Mindaugas, I mean, the way he looks and the way he performs is like difference. He doesn't really look so strong, but his tendons and everything, he's like rock solid, you know?
SPEAKER_00: That's the neat part of arm wrestling. Some guys look like they've never picked up a weight in their life, and I'd have better luck arm wrestling my truck outside than they would. It's really neat. It's a very interesting sport. My buddy Samuel Teeters, he lives like two hours from me. Dave you pulled with Samuel, or have you seen him pull? I've seen him, yeah. When I tell you, when he comes to practice on a good day, he could absolutely be number two in North America. That's incredible.
SPEAKER_01: and he's another one of those guys he walks around 154 pounds he's like six foot six one super scrawny like doesn't look like nothing but he comes on the table he doesn't even train just comes on the table and he's just ridiculously strong he'll come to practice once every like three or four months kill everyone and then not train for the three or four months come back and murder everyone again yeah i i remember has john ever told you joseph about kevin bongard no
SPEAKER_02: No, there was another guy very tall. He looked skinny, but his joints were like rock solid. He was very, very strong. When John used to live in Utah, they were training together. Therrien are some guys like Mendoza that doesn't look so muscular, but their tendons are still strong. How tall is Mendoza? Probably 5'11".
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Yeah, probably like 180 centimeters. He's got the long forearms too. Yeah, I was curious what his elbow to fingertip length would be. I think it's long, but I can't miss that opportunity to tease him. I think that it's not really tall, but it's because skinny looks tall. I don't know if he's watching us, but there is no human being on this earth that
SPEAKER_02: when we talked about arm wrestling, I don't...
SPEAKER_02: Like I enjoy teasing Mindaugas more than anyone else. He takes it good. He sometimes teases me back, but last time he teased me so much and I destroyed him. And he said, from now on, if you ever pull again, he will try to not to provoke me. He said that probably that's why he's staying quiet. I tried to provoke him, but Jay says, let's see a bicep comparing flex. He says, oh.
SPEAKER_02: big gun how tall are you cody uh five nine five nine oh yeah they oh yeah oh yeah they both have huge biceps you know oh yeah wow
SPEAKER_02: huge look look at the boat you know the shoulders are like i mean like if i didn't know what your weight is i could just guess 220 for both of you yeah i know when i was looking at the east versus west picture it really did look like me and joseph had the best looking forearms out of everyone i don't know we're gonna get there be the smallest too yeah for sure
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but I mean, you both are really looking huge. Yeah. Scary. Yeah. I mean, listen, as of now, like, especially in lighter weight category, West is stronger, but they are not made of iron or something, you know, we'd be all like, it is all about the competition difficulty over there is more than,
SPEAKER_02: i mean tougher than here they go off they go european championships asian championships so they compete and then they better each other while you guys are a bit isolated over there yeah very spread out too yeah yeah if you guys would go the reason that look at the reason that
SPEAKER_02: like Carter Shinks, John, Ron, and the super heavyweights from North America are more competitive with the ISIS because they had more opportunity. They had more opportunity to be invited for the professional events.
SPEAKER_02: And the more they come, the better they become as well because they were part of the competition. While the lightweights didn't have so much opportunity. So hopefully all together we're going to change this. Like look at Paul Lin. Like if you would ask me five years ago, he won the West vs. West world title. He won the belt. And so...
SPEAKER_02: I would never expect that. I would never doubt that Pauline because he kind of started arm wrestling late and then he came and because of the competition level he is bettering himself every event. So I think that this will be good for you guys and to be part of this. After this match hopefully you guys will have more opportunities against the Eastern guys and then I think that somehow
SPEAKER_02: With time, the lightweights of North America will catch the eastern guys, yeah. Yeah, I'm excited. Hellboy is the only eastern puller that I've even gotten the chance to grip up with.
SPEAKER_02: I definitely want to see, because I know their style is completely different than the American style. They're a lot more internal rotation and cup oriented, where the Americans are a lot more side pressure oriented. Yeah, but that was an impressive win. He is not the best from this side of the world, but he is for sure a dangerous puller when you beat him. What were you saying, Joseph? You were saying something? The Hellboy is a natural born freak.
SPEAKER_01: yeah dude i mean his right arm was made to arm wrestle so that was a very impressive match by cody did his hand feel like a giant balloon what was that like man it was it was huge three one three one because i tried to top her one of the rounds and that was not the way to go yeah um but it was it was surprisingly comfortable because it wasn't like hard like a rock so when i gripped up with it that's when i like it was soft
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it wasn't super soft, but it was soft enough to where I was like, okay, I'm not terrified of this hand. But most people don't know that I've had a wrist injury since March of last year. So when I pulled Roman in the December tournament, I hadn't got to try and hook a single time leading up to that. I just popped some ibuprofen, hoped for the best, and went inside. And then when I pulled Hellboy, I got to pull the hook one time in a practice before I pulled with Hellboy, hoped for the best. So when I went in the first time,
SPEAKER_01: He put so much down pressure on my wrist, I didn't know if it would hold up the other rounds. So then I tried to go outside and then I realized, okay, I'm just gonna have to don't care about the wrist, go inside. It was Hunter that hurt your wrist initially, right? Yeah, the first round of that 176 round, Robin, Hunter hurt it and then I had to go 10 more rounds or nine more rounds with a hurt wrist. How did he hurt you? Did he top roll you?
SPEAKER_01: No, he put so much down pressure like this. I'm a really open bicep puller, so when I went to rotate, all that down pressure made something let loose. How is it now? How is it right now? It's the best it's been in a long time. I can try and hook every practice. It takes a little bit for it to warm up, but after that, I'm good to go. They're asking your height.
SPEAKER_00: 5-7. 5-7. Yeah. And, yeah, we will see. And what is your favorite match other than your match in this card? Okay, it's going to be really interesting with Devon and Corey. And how do you guys see this match? I think Devon's inevitably going to win, but I think it might be a little closer than some people think.
SPEAKER_01: See, I don't think that match is going to be very close. Just because Corey has so little endurance. He's one of the strongest guys out there, but he's got so little endurance, and Devon's going to, even if it's a ref grip, he's going to screw around the setup enough. And not only that, but Devon does very, very well against hook guys. If he was pulling a guy that could just flop press like a mill, because Devon's back pressure is not that crazy. His hammer curl is not that strong. So he really struggles against guys that don't need their hand to pull.
SPEAKER_01: But with Corey, he needs his hand to pull. So if he gets cracked one time, he's gassed for the rest of the match. He did really good against Tobias.
SPEAKER_02: Corey is with left arm more outside, with right arm more pulling with the wrist. I mentioned this many times. I saw him one time training with Paulo, and Paulo took his wrist, and Corey easily pressed Paulo. If he has a flop press, then it could be Corey. I didn't know he had a flop press. Yeah, it was after their match in...
SPEAKER_02: And then after pull, they did it. And I remember one time when they are training, Paulo took his and then he put his shoulder and he pressed. So if the match somehow comes like halfway to win inside of Corey, that press because he's huge, you know, and I saw him doing that. It can be dangerous. Yeah. And the way these guys do. What's that?
SPEAKER_02: He's fast. He's pretty fast. I saw him versus Tobias in person. I mean, the dude can move. The truth is that the rounds without the strap, Tobias was the fast one. But once the match went to strap, then Corey dominated. So he had a problem with going strap, but his dominance in the strap
SPEAKER_02: was impressive. Because Tobias is not a weak guy. I think he won one round against Kamil and Kamil's left arm is very strong. Kamil lost to Lalletin 4-2. Kamil is no joke. I don't know how it will be. It depends on Devon. West of Devon, yes. But I know that Devon
SPEAKER_02: in Tbilisi and Devon that we will see next week will not be the same Devon. Maybe close, but for sure not the same Devon. And it's his left arm, you know. This is the first time he's had a good competition with the left in how many years?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, he had been pulling. He wasn't training, but he pulled against Andrei, he pulled against Sergei Kalnichenko, he pulled against Georgi Tsvetkov. Yeah, he pulled like three, four matches. But I don't think that he especially trained for them. He was calling it like party arm or something. And then now he said, okay, let me do some serious. Because I think that he was pushing his right arm way too much.
SPEAKER_02: in one super match after another super match so now he can rotate one right it looks like this is the strategy that he's gonna follow like right and left like he pulled in georgia the right arm now he's pulling left arm and then again he will pull one left one right i think in june he wants to pull left and then in august he wants to pull right arm we will see we will see yeah and and john versus kanai
SPEAKER_02: And Joseph, I'm sure that you won't be so objective about this one, but still I would like to hear what you say. I think John's going to beat him. You believe that? Yeah, I do. I do believe that. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, let me ask you some more detailed question. Whenever... Yoshi had a really good match versus Todd, you know? Yeah. So that...
SPEAKER_02: I want to ask you something. You can tell me everything altogether. Whenever people put some practice videos of John on YouTube or somewhere, I look at it, I say, oh, John is in a serious trouble. Like, I mean, he doesn't really look that great. And then he comes, and then we saw what he did to Leonidas. And, like, and then before this Canary match, I saw him again.
SPEAKER_00: I wasn't impressed. I know he just trains, but he's in good shape right now? Competition John and practice John are two different flavors. Yeah, we know it. I'll get pins on John in practice. He's always been like that. For as long as I've been able to train with him, he'll get a few good hard pulls and that'll really be it. In his strategy, it's definitely different how he trains compared to everybody else.
SPEAKER_02: Whatever it is, it works for him. Baba, do you believe that he's as good as his last match against Leonidas? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. You think so? Really? I do, yeah. Okay, if he's in that shape to beat Leonidas, then, yeah, the things may be different than what I was guessing. And you, Cody, how do you see this one?
SPEAKER_01: If John's, I think John's probably going to get his hand taken. So if he still has the flop press like he did against Leonidas, I think he'll probably end up coming out with a win. But I do see it being like 3-1 or 3-2. So you are saying John is going to win?
SPEAKER_01: think it'll be john three one or three two he always seems to have something up his sleeve like you're always like it's like that match with leonidas i thought leonidas was looking like an absolute freak like he posted his pronation lifts and i was like what in the world yeah and i was like it's probably going to lead towards leonidas but it just seemed like john always has something up his sleeve to pull out a win yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: Let's see. Let's see how it will be. I'm excited for Giannis, too. That's my favorite match is Giannis versus Mendoza. If you tell me, don't disrespect anyone. But if you tell me to pick one match, I think that would be the match. I am trying to make these guys play against each other forever. And finally, they are going to pull. And how do you guys see this match? I've got it going towards Mendoza.
SPEAKER_01: I don't see it going through 3-0 either way. I think it'll be like 3-1 or 3-2. But I think Mindaugas is going to, I think his defensive style is going to give Giannis some trouble. Because Giannis is really like here and Mindaugas is going to be trying to do the kickback and retreating style. And I think that's going to eventually get Giannis. It totally depends, you know, after the goal comes, how their risk position will be.
SPEAKER_02: like like this is different than like if one is like this the other one is like this like because they both go back pressure versus back pressure and so that the one that who has stronger wrists will survive while the other one or maybe they will be just both losing their wrists a little how do you see that joseph i think cody could be right you know i mean
SPEAKER_00: I wouldn't be surprised either which way who wins. It's the lightweight goat versus the Jedi. So it's going to be an extremely technical match. I want to say Giannis. Since he's going with Mandalorian, I'm going to say Giannis and take this one.
SPEAKER_02: Like you want Giannis to win or you think Giannis is going to win? I think Giannis will. Okay, okay. I do. I do see Giannis being more explosive. So I think if Giannis could put enough bullets into Mindaugas, he still has a more explosive hit than Mindaugas. I've never seen Mindaugas really fire off too hard on the right. Okay. The Hunter has a super chat. Cody making the Southeast proud. Wood luck, buddy. He says.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and let's go. Georgi Swetko, Dave Chaffee. I've got Georgi. I think, unless Dave's gotten a lot smarter on the table, it seems like Dave always just goes sideways and doesn't care about his hand, and Georgi has a lot of endurance. We will see. Yeah, Dave, Dave. Go ahead, Georgi. Dave said...
SPEAKER_00: He's been feeling healthy as of lately. So he's like, he's been saying he's been able to train a lot harder. He's been injury free for the most part. Um, we'll see if that makes a massive difference. I know Dave's top end power. I think pay to pay Dave is going to beat him in side pressure, but like Cody was saying to Georgi, he's very, very enduring and he's very technical. Oh, that's a good match.
SPEAKER_02: You will see. Only eight days. Wow, we are that close. Wow. Can you believe it? Only eight days. Yeah. Yeah. And... Oh, this is also a very good one. Matt Mask versus Kydyrgali Ongarbaev.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't realize Ongarbaev has just started recovering from a surgery because I was just going Ongarbaev. Yeah, I was just going Ongarbaev 100% not close. But since I found out that he's just coming out of surgery and like he's recovering, it could be closer. But Ongarbaev is like one of my favorite arm wrestlers. So I've got to go with Ongarbaev for that reason.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, but don't you think that you will be labeled as a betrayer for the Team West? Look, I've got guys that I like from the West. I've got guys I like from the West. I don't like how... That's the most healthy way, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I love how smart the West is. The West aren't dumb pullers. The guys from the West, they'll do the same move five times in a row, change nothing, and it just gets so frustrating to watch. Where the guys in the West, they might lose one, they might lose the second one, but then they'll change something up and find a lane. I love watching that rather than the same move over and over. Yeah, but did you know that the whole West learned this from an American player?
SPEAKER_00: John Bersink, yeah. We all learn, you know, to be that well-rounded from him, you know, yeah. And how do you see Joseph? Man, if Ongarbaev lets the wild horse come out, if he gives Matt any momentum, it could be a bad day for Kurt Galli. We know how fiery Matt is. You know, if he gets some momentum on his side, he's got a nasty hit. And he's a good arm wrestler. So it'll be... I think...
SPEAKER_02: I think Matt might take this one. Okay, Cody says, do you guys realize that you guys are picking the opposite guys? Except John, I think, yeah. It's hard to bet against John. It's always hard to bet against John. Yeah, yeah. Listen, listen, if John is John, I mean, I know better than anyone else what he can do. I just do not know how he feels. So that is very hard to...
SPEAKER_02: um very hard to be sure you know because sometimes are not some things are not under your control you know yeah because i also have all those uh injuries and everything sometimes you know it but you just can't do it you know because i mean you are limited anyways stara versus jocelyn i think sarah's been training hard um i i
SPEAKER_01: I don't think she was really expecting how strong Jocelyne was going to be going to that because I got to watch the round robin in person. I don't think she was expecting how strong Jocelyne was going to be. Oh, you were there when this happened? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was there that day because Scarlett was competing in the 154 and below my girlfriend. Yeah. And so I got to watch them compete. I think Sarah is going to come into this a lot more prepared.
SPEAKER_01: And I think she's got something to prove now. Now, I do think Jocelyne is an amazing puller. She surprised the heck out of everyone there when she beat Sarah. But I do think Sarah is going to end up coming out. I'm sure Sarah is stronger than last time and she will pull in the right direction. But the only thing is that Jocelyne is also like we can consider her a new puller. And she's ridiculously strong. I think she bench presses like 315 as a lady. That is just otherworldly strong.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. And what I'm just saying is since last time to this time, like whatever it was, 11 months ago or 10 months ago,
SPEAKER_02: usually is more in the favor of the newer puller because when you train 20 years another 10 months you understand like makes difference maybe but not so much but when you are new that 11 months 10 months whatever it is it really improves you more especially if you want to match last time
SPEAKER_02: So right now, Sarah has advantage of like experiencing that loss and she's not going to take her lightly. She's going to bring much better shape and she will pull in the right direction. While we know that Jocelyne is now much more experienced because of
SPEAKER_02: being a new puller and now she is probably, I think she is as you said 315-320 pounds bench press so she is probably already strong and she is translating more power like maybe almost a similar case as you are. You were already very very strong but you just needed to transfer the power to the table. And how do you see that Joseph?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know too much about Jocelyne. And also it's hard for me to really pick one in that. I'm going to lean towards Sarah's experience. I think the first match, you know, like you guys are saying, she knows how Jocelyne is going to pull. She knows not to underestimate her. So I think if she accepted the match and she feels good enough, I think the confidence is there. She could take it. We talked about Hunter versus Mindaugas, but do you guys have any idea about Valen?
SPEAKER_01: i know a little bit about him i know he's got some he's got some very solid wins um i do see hunter getting to his position where he wants to be and i think not too many people can sustain that hit multiple times in a row and i think hunter is going to end up winning that one i think i think it'll be 3-1 but i think it'll be i think it'll be hunter okay and and sharkovich
SPEAKER_01: Andrei. I've got Andrei. I've got Andrei for that one. Andrei hasn't lost a match, I don't think, since Adam Wierzynski. It seems like, especially any top roller, he just kicks the thumb out and it's just over from there, drags back and kicks the thumb. Cody, have you pulled with Andrei before? No, I got to talk with him a little bit at Arnold's, but I didn't get to pull him. He's ridiculous.
SPEAKER_00: He is so strong, Andrei. He's incredible. I'm leaning Andrei, too, for this one. I know the guy he's pulling against a 20-year-old. He's only 20. Oh, wow. I didn't know that. That's crazy. Arsen, yeah, he's a 20-year-old. He's got a win on, I think, Zur. The guy that was doing the massive pronation lift. It was a Russian tournament. He's got some incredible wins under his belt. I'm leaning Andrei, but it'll be good. I didn't know he was that young. I thought he'd be...
SPEAKER_02: He's a big boy to be there. 20 or 21. He's younger than we are. Wow. I didn't know that he was that young either. Okay. Yeah, this one is also huge, huge match. And you guys will have good opinion. Craig versus John.
SPEAKER_01: I said that Brandon Elsesser was going to crush John Therrien, and he proved me wrong. So I kind of want to keep my opinion to myself here because last time he just shut me up real hard. So Craig is a hard one to beat because he does have so many lanes, but John is coming up so fast. I really don't know who's going to win this one.
SPEAKER_00: John got a lot of momentum behind him right now, for sure. Craig is super experienced. And we'll see if that experience plays a factor in it. I'm going to say John, I think John might take it. Yeah, the thing that I like about you guys that you guys have opinion, not
SPEAKER_02: because of where you are from, but this is just, you are just saying your mind that that's good. That's very good. Yeah. That's a healthy way to judge the things. Yeah. So you guys are saying that John is the favorite? I think he could be. Yeah. On paper, I don't think so. I think Craig's got a lot more under his belt, but I think John could take it easily. Easily?
SPEAKER_01: I know. I wouldn't be surprised if he takes it. Oh, okay. I don't think the match is going to be easy, but if he wins, I will not be surprised at all. But Craig is for sure right now the best under 198 in the U.S.? I believe so, yes. Yeah. I believe somebody like Adam Worzynski would give John Therrien more trouble, but I think Craig's style is very hard against Adam's style.
SPEAKER_01: Because Craig is so explosive while Adam is kind of not really fast. And with John Theron, he's going to be kind of going outside. I haven't seen anybody take Adam's hand except for Bacho. And even Bacho, like, Bacho didn't fold his wrist. He just kind of flat because he's so much substantially stronger. Like, Bacho's an animal. Yeah, Bacho is very strong. His match with Brett Grundy was also... Yeah, I think that guy has potential to become...
SPEAKER_02: like top somewhere, you know? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I need to set him some more dangerous matches. He gave a very tough match to Reno, Reno Massage. And he gained so much weight for that too. I mean, he was down a couple of weight classes and still did that good. Yeah. Reno just won the
SPEAKER_02: heavyweight world title. So just imagine how good Basho is. It's the last name for sure. Yeah, yeah. I got to go change my name right now. Put a Billy at the end of it. No, you can make it Brzing. You can make Bas. That's good enough. Anyway, so Cody Merritt versus Evgeny Prudnik. Cool.
SPEAKER_02: really don't know too much about evgeny's left hand because he beat daddy can but he was he was like light heavyweight he beat daddy can and he lost i think first time he pulled left arm super match at east versus west i think he lost tobias i think either 3-1 or 3-0 or something
SPEAKER_02: and then he beat who did he pull he beat dadikian and he lost alijan but everyone was yeah i mean yeah do you know what his weight is right now like compared like his weight now i think he is about 250. okay so he's about what 20 pounds heavier than he was then or
SPEAKER_02: 15 or so. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Then who, when you pull against who, like, you mean Alijan and Dadikian matches? Yeah, the Dadikian match. Yeah, he's heavier. Yeah, he's heavier. But just remember, these guys are making the weight and usually ending up about, like, they make 231. Next day, they are 240 or 245. You understand? So if he's 250 now, it's maybe...
SPEAKER_02: Like he won't be hurting himself because of the weight loss, but they end up around the same weight, you know, even when they are pulling. Like Devon, he was like front of us, you know, he made 105 kilo. Next day he was 117 kilo. He was about 25 pounds heavier, like next evening, you know, in one and a half days. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: yeah so how is his versatility uh ah with left arm he is more of inside with left guy yeah this is what i remember i'm not sure because cody merritt is also very inconsistent with how he does it seems like if he trains really hard he gets really good and then if he's not training so much he's
SPEAKER_02: loses a lot of power i think he was already getting ready for a like a i think in bob brown's event or something he was gonna pull right arm he's gonna pull i think so he's getting ready for that if i'm not mistaken so if he was also trading his left arm so i think that he's in i i expect him to be in good shape and i expect prudnik to be in good shape because he lost his last three matches
SPEAKER_01: can't afford to lose in fact losing against cody wouldn't take a lot from him because different weight category yeah yeah i say it could be it'll i think it'll either be three two because there was a stop or cody will end up flashing him three oh i think the the power difference is just gonna go through the hand i think it'll either be three oh or it'll be three two uh
SPEAKER_02: towards Cody trying to like towards uh no Evgeny Evgeny thank you if it is 3-0 it's for for Cody and then 3-2 for Evgeny that's what you're saying that's what I believe okay so you are not sure if Cody can do the same thing two times or three times you know is this what you're right okay if Evgeny can put the brakes on him I think Evgeny will end up winning that inevitably for sure but I think if Cody can just rip through him each time it just depends on which Cody shows up
SPEAKER_00: we're saying if he was training hard and he's healthy i think he could very well go through him but if afghani has enough to put the brakes on him and make it a long match i think he's gonna win yeah we will see we will see and let's talk um michael todd versus vitality in the next east versus west main events
SPEAKER_02: How do you guys see that match? A lot of people think that Laletin is going to go through, you know, boom, you know, but I mean, I just like, it's very hard for me to be sure about that because I don't know how many people can just flash pin Michael. Because I remember, rest in peace, Pushkar when he pulled against Michael.
SPEAKER_02: He did two rounds, but the following four rounds, he was stopped by Michael. And Pushkar, in my opinion, is one of the most explosive and powerful starts he has. And so how do you guys see? Do you guys think that Vitaly is going to flash pin him or Michael is going to stop him? And if he stops him, how it would go? This match is very important because the winner of this match
SPEAKER_01: will be pulling we don't know if levan or hermes but the winner of hermes and levan but how do you guys see this one i think vitale's best chance is to keep him outside of the straps and vitale does have what the strongest strongest grip in the world so i think if anybody can keep him outside the straps it is vitale i think if he can keep him outside the straps for three flash pins then it's probably going to be vitale um but i think if it goes to the straps
SPEAKER_01: Michael Todd is so good about just cracking the wrist one time. And I don't know if Vitaly has enough to finish. Vitaly's been flat pressing a lot. But do you think his flat press is enough to go through Michael Todd, though? I mean, you mean the flat press, you're talking about the Morozov match, but to be honest, like round one and round two, there were
SPEAKER_02: two times like cracks on Morozov's elbow. When your elbow is cracked, you know, this type of, like when you are over pronated is the worst part, you know, for your elbow. If you can keep it a little bit that way, maybe, yeah. But I'm not taking anything from Vitaly's victory. Vitaly won fair and square and he's the left arm king.
SPEAKER_02: But what I just say that if Morozov wasn't injured, could he still press him with that wrist or not? I don't know about that one because I don't remember Vitaly winning other matches, not so many matches, once his wrist was bent, especially with right arm. That's my worry for him as well. I haven't seen him. If he doesn't have full hand control, he really struggles. Evgeny with Dave Chaffee, he really struggled to get the finish.
SPEAKER_02: On the right arm. Yeah, first time, 4-3, Dave won. Second time, 5-1, Vitaly won. But even the last round, when Vitaly let Dave get to the straps, he still struggled to pin Dave. And Dave won. But I asked Vitaly about that. And he said he allowed Dave to get his spots. I don't know about that one. You understand?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know how it is. If he said it, I believe him. But sometimes we think something may not be like we really we are honest about it. But maybe it is not as we think. So maybe we tell it for sure is thinking that way. And he really allowed but we don't know if if
SPEAKER_02: if he didn't allow we can't say that they couldn't win that round or win we don't know that yeah anyway so so you guys are saying that like i want to see michael win i'd really want to see michael win because i think yeah i think the match that could come after could be very interesting i'd rather see i'd rather see le latin versus levon again
SPEAKER_02: We're going to see all these matches. First of all, as I said, we don't know who Michael vs. Lallatin winner will face. We don't know if it's Hermes or Levan.
SPEAKER_02: Just remember, there are only a handful of people. I don't even think that there are even five people that can really trouble Levan. So, Michael, Devon, Laletin, Hermes, you know, we will see. We will see all these matches. This match is only determining, you know, the person who is going to pull end of this year for the world title match.
SPEAKER_01: But other than that, you know, just like that match will happen, you know. I think Devon versus Michael is a really tough match for Michael just because now we see that Devon does have a really good flop press. We saw that with Devon. And we also see that nobody has touched Devon's riser. I mean, I can't think of a single time Devon's got his riser actually compromised. Yeah, that's his biggest weapon, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_01: I think so as well. And because of that, I think he's just going to crack Michael Todd's riser if they end up do pulling. And I think it's going to be pretty easy for him if he pulls Michael. But I think Lilletton has a long enough arm to attack his pinky and make it a more interesting match. Like they did the first time that they pulled. The alley will win the height game every time. Yeah, it'll be. When they pulled the first time, the trouble that Levan had,
SPEAKER_02: he wanted to control him and beat in this way. So when you go the side way and the guy is doing low hand top roll, he's really hitting the bottom finger. But if you realize that,
SPEAKER_02: When he came back to here, when Lalezin took Levan here and Levan rise, rise and then beat and then all the other rounds he did right away and it would get easier and easier and easier. The thing is that when I was in Tbilisi, when I did the interview with Lalezin, I said, Vitaly, you know, you did this way and do you plan to do that? He said that,
SPEAKER_02: um as far as i remember he said that he is not like for many years la let him was did you guys know that la let him was even 190 pound guy you know wow yeah yeah europeans and everything yeah 198 so he didn't really have so much muscle like you know he's so tall only
SPEAKER_02: I mean, his tendons and bones probably would make, I'm just extreme in, but, and so he was kind of afraid to be hooked. So, and all these guys had shorter arms. So he did this for many years to be, not to be hooked, especially by Krasimir Kostadino. He was doing like this. So when you use your wrist all the time like this, so you are a bit, you know,
SPEAKER_02: not that good about the riser because you but right now in these years that the guys that he's pulling against are not as cold as him but but near compared to the the 198 and right now looks like nobody can hook him so he told me that like i'm training this more and he is not planning to do this anymore to levan so he will probably do some
SPEAKER_01: rising a high posting yeah yeah yeah war against you know i don't know how it will end up but yeah i think that's why i think that's why guys like brian shaw are going to struggle in the sport because i feel like there is a point where being too big is a negative and he is so huge like i feel like he's going to limit the amount of things he can actually do on the table he needs very very very very long time
SPEAKER_02: And in that long time, he should not lose his motivation. And then we can see something. In any shorter period, like before three, four years,
SPEAKER_02: um we we can't expect anything from him to be competitive in the top 10 or something you know just i think that he should still continue pulling against some strong man like but when i say strong man but strong men and armors like leonie does like like um let it go to go to tournaments you know yeah he should go to the tournaments and just do some tournaments
SPEAKER_02: local tournaments and just work your way up that's how everyone really starts i i think this like because he's been so famous um maybe he wouldn't want to
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think so for the same reason, but I think it's also going to hold him back because I know he's got so many sponsors and he's got such a big name. If somebody at a tournament ended up beating him, it would make him look horrible as the big name that he is. So I see why he wouldn't want to compete in a tournament, but I really do think that it would benefit him in the sport.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't know if he wouldn't want that or if he would want, but I'm just thinking maybe that is a possibility that he would only stick to, like when you go to a tournament, you can't choose the opponent. You don't know who's going to show up there, right? That's the beauty of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And yeah, when you say it's beauty, you are right, but I think the better arm masters, like it depends, you know, like from which perspective you go. You go VARF,
SPEAKER_02: And then there are like 10 favorite guys, you know, from Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Georgi, Turkey, Bulgaria, you know. And then maybe one-on-one you may beat a guy, but everyone is so close by level. You may have round two, a one-minute long match, and then you end up... Go against a guy who's fresh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It happened to Roman. When me and Roman Gromov, I mean, he's...
SPEAKER_01: clearly up there um he ended up popping his elbow against me left-handed and then got third because he popped his elbow when he should have if he clearly got probably it was a super match he was it was anyways you know if he really popped that elbow yeah well because like i i beat him and then he pulled uh in the semi-finals or the uh yeah i guess it was a semi-finals quarterfinals and then he ended up getting third because he lost to a guy that hadn't had any long matches
SPEAKER_02: where he had popped his elbow. So then the guy flopped and he ended up in that same position we were talking about earlier where he's trying to come out of it, but he just can't because the elbow's compromised. It was 2017. Normally, I decided not to pull anymore after early 2016. And I was like three months away from the wars. I was 200 pounds and I cut weight to 154 pounds.
SPEAKER_02: And then I won the first round against Ukrainian. And the second round, I beat Hristo, you know, the referee Hristo. And then the third round, I beat Daniel Prokopchuk. But because of losing all that 45, 50 pounds, you know, and I lost the next two matches, but I was undefeated after three matches.
SPEAKER_02: The guy that I beat, I ended up ninth place. And the first guy that I beat, Ukrainian, he took sixth. Hristo took fifth. And Daniel Prokopchuk won the gold. He came from B-side, he beat everyone, he beat in the final Mindaugas twice, and he won the gold. But I sent him to the B-side. So, I mean, tournament, tournaments, like, you need to be one head above everyone.
SPEAKER_02: to make sure that you win. You may still win, but there may be some draw. You may have a battle, and then you may end up taking fifth or something while maybe one-on-one, you are the best guy. Yeah. All right, Ingen, who's one guy that doesn't arm wrestle that you'd love to see join the sport, that you just think could be an absolute freak?
SPEAKER_01: No one came to my mind, but maybe if there is someone, maybe you remind me. I've got Tom Hovland and... Who's the pull-up guy? Andrei or... Russian dude? Yeah, the Russian dude. Anatoly? No, no, no. I think they've tried to get him in the pool. I think he pulled with Dennis a little bit. I know you're talking about...
SPEAKER_02: He's got like a 300-something pound pull-up. It's just otherworldly. And he's also like 360, too. Oh, you're talking about Smythe. I don't know if he can do very well in arm wrestling. You don't think so? Not sure. Like...
SPEAKER_02: Too big, you know, those muscles. I heard he's strong, but I heard that he is not that great. But if he's super powerful, sometimes you don't need to be that great. To be fair, he's pulling with the strongest guys in the world over in Russia. Yeah. Not that good. He's probably top of America. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there are a lot of strong guys, but we need to... Sometimes, my friends, some guys may not look that good,
SPEAKER_02: but maybe more effective at the table. So I would just think that, how do you call that the, how do you say that the people who are training with their own body weight? Therrien is some- Calisthenics. Yeah, I think that we need to find guys from there. And I think that's why you are very good about arm wrestling. Yeah, I've been saying we need to get in contact with like ex-gymnasts, because I really think a bunch of ex-gymnasts would be amazing. Because I mean, when you're working with the rings, you're always here.
SPEAKER_02: yeah and so that and they've got their hands strong anyway and they they are like so explosive explosive also they have super control and they have unlike that that um partial training they are doing everything with like
SPEAKER_02: whole body you know walking and they can like in a static way they can lock themselves very good very good with time under tension yeah yeah yeah i mean and their stabilizers are all great so everything that would be good for arm wrestling is already there and built from gymnastics yes yes yes yes i mean i i would i would i would prefer i used to call it i will tell you i i when i used to live in u.s i was doing roofing and my my friend who passed
SPEAKER_02: who passed away, his name Chris Anderson.
SPEAKER_02: he had the roofing company and with 1970 truck, we were going to a job and at the backside of the trunk side, you know, we had the bars from corners to corners, you know, we were putting the leather up there and we were tightening with the rubber, what do you call, bungee cord or how you call that? Yeah, yeah, bungee cords. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so where the end of the truck with the driver license at the backside,
SPEAKER_02: The bar was there. So while he was driving, I remember speed limit was 70. He was driving always 72. So he was saying that the cops wouldn't give him ticket for two miles. So I was doing that static pull-up up there, you understand, waiting while he's driving. And my body was hanging to the road, you know. That's awesome. Until we arrived, you know, where we are going to work. And then I wasn't putting my feet there. And then one minute later, I was putting the lefts.
SPEAKER_02: until we go. And then he was looking at me from the mirror and he was doing like this. But I was like really strong, my hand. Just ask Ron, Ron will tell you about my hand strength, you know, just ask him in the next practice. And whenever he was doing this, you know, and I was just moving to the bicep and the, you know, because the car was shaking, you understand? Yeah. Yeah. So I'm just telling you around those years, my best years, I was mostly doing just one arm pull-ups.
SPEAKER_02: like nothing else and table training yeah people things at all how does it help a lot of things you can still train at the table if you have a very strong beginning position of the mess I tell everyone like one exercise pull-ups and because like you get your hand shrink like if you're doing wide grip pull-ups you get like you get chopped as well you get
SPEAKER_00: back pressure hammer curl you get your lat strength cup i mean everything besides fingertips and if you do if you do any like rock climbing hangboard work you get your fingertips as well so i mean you get everything from what's this so cody's the pull-up king i got a question so what do you think translates better do you think like uh the horizontal pull or like more vertical like what grip do you think is the best for the translates
SPEAKER_01: I've done, the only time I do here neutral grip is when I'm doing my one-arm pull-ups. But you got to think about it like this. So like when you're pronated, your brachioradialis is fully engaged. When you're neutral, you're only partially engaged. And when you're here, it's all bicep. So you've got to decide what you want to utilize for...
SPEAKER_02: on the table. You should do all three. You should do this. You should do the parallel one and you should do this because you need that strength. When you go outside, you need more like reverse. When you are going inside, more like the parallel type. And if you are going inside, you need to do that inside pull up.
SPEAKER_02: I used to love chin-ups, but I've had so many wrist injuries. Now my wrist can't handle the pressure because I can't supinate quite as far. Like I used to be able to go fully palm up. If you hold them, like when you do this, it hurts. But how about if you put them close? My range of motion is only there now because I used to go fully flat, but now I can only go there. So it just hurts. That's very interesting that you are so young and you are already very limited. Is it because you train so much pronation or what?
SPEAKER_01: think it's because when i trained like when i first figured out i could hook i would get here and i would try to like just rotate and the injuries here from just the rotation cause very poor range of motion in the wrists
SPEAKER_01: Cause I used to be able to go palm up pretty easy, but because of wrist injuries, I haven't even been able to do any flat wristed pushups or anything like that in years. So I'll get to do all my, I've got to do all my pushups. It's on my knuckles now. Yeah. I can't do. Same. I know I couldn't do that. That I, I,
SPEAKER_02: Evgeny when I was in army, I was doing this, the commanders, they were getting very angry with me. No, you need to do this, right? I was like, no, it just doesn't go back. It hurts my wrist. Yeah, yeah. The same, similar stories. Anyways, guys, do you guys have any message to your fans or arm wrestling fans or to each other? And then we are here for like one hour and 10 minutes, 70 minutes.
SPEAKER_00: let's close it and it was big fun to chat with you guys joseph any any last words guys buy the pay-per-view come out support support one of the greatest cards there's ever been and again thank you for having us man thank you for the opportunity it's been awesome cody looking forward to meeting you man looking forward to going to war i'm excited
SPEAKER_01: Absolutely. Like he said, by the pay-per-view, check out my sponsor, Solemn Sports. They've got a bar that I really think is going to help translate directly to arm wrestling because you get to internally rotate while you curl. I think that's going to help revolutionize, especially in American arm wrestling, actually translating your power to the table. But yeah.
