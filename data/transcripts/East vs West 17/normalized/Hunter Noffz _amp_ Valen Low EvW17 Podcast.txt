SPEAKER_03: Hello, everyone. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Anyways, OK, today we will have... ..two of... ..the rising stars. One is Hunter Knowles from the US and Valen Low from Singapore. And these athletes, they both have... ..much greater dreams.
SPEAKER_01: than winning against each other. But they both realised that this is where they start from. I mean, you need to start from somewhere. Nobody can reach the biggest goal without having steps forward to that dream.
SPEAKER_01: and these two athletes they see this as part of beginning and soon very soon we will see where they are are they close to their goals or not but very soon we will we will understand
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let me share this on social media. And then we can start. Just one second. Let me also put on Instagram. Then let's go.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you for your patience and very soon in seven, eight minutes, probably they will also join us. I hope you all are
SPEAKER_01: Doing very good. Okay, I'm done with sharing today. I will have also Jocelyne Brisson podcast. Okay, let's go. Trip over. Hello, my friends. Hello. I can't read this, but probably you said privates.
SPEAKER_01: Kiko Fabia, South Asia, Southeast Asia represent, yes, finally. Kuan, hello. Sean, our nation, he says. Hi. How rich am I? Hans is asking. It totally depends, you know, what you think the richness is. You mean money or you mean different type of richness?
SPEAKER_01: um hasus servant give devon or jesus i think is it give devon versus vitally yeah but not in may devon doesn't accept to pull vitally in may but he accepts to pull him in august and mayhem are messing worldwide hey man long time no see says
SPEAKER_01: Michael workspace. Hello. And again, great card is for 17 will be amazing. I think you will go in person. Am I wrong? It will be very near to you. Mario skate. What's up? By the way, 90% of the North America is still sleeping right now. Hmm.
SPEAKER_01: But what can we do? Just think about that. The time difference, like the zone difference between Hunter and Wallenloch is 13 hours. So, I mean, that is the perfect time to do it, 13 hours. Because right now, over here, it's almost 5 p.m. And where Hunter is...
SPEAKER_01: It's 9 a.m. And where Valen is, it's 10 p.m. So I think that is the best time. Hello, Engin. How are you? I'm doing fine, my friend. I hope you are as well. And I see you are training.
SPEAKER_01: Myham Armwrestling Worldwide. Let's go Valen. He says, Engin, have you ever had front wrist ligament pain? I had all kind of pain. Iron Golem, all kind of. Omega, Koski, Hayes. He says, Michael works space. Engin, can you confirm who is the main event? Someone said it wasn't John versus Yoshi. Most likely it will be John versus Yoshi. If it was a title match or something, you know,
SPEAKER_01: Like if Morozov didn't get injured and if he was pulling Devon, still, you know, but I think as of now, this is... Mayhem Armwrestling Worldwide. The Asian community is blowing up in armwrestling world. This is a great opportunity for the talent in Asia to show their skills. We are very, very happy with the involvement of the Asian armwrestlers. And Kanai also is in the same cards. And...
SPEAKER_01: dino says um hello from croatian how are you how is the health everything is good i mean there are a lot of people who are in uh worser condition and hello valen hello my friend do you hear me valen do you hear me
SPEAKER_01: Hello. Do you hear me well? Hey, can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, I hear you. Yeah. How are you? Great. Fantastic. It's at night 10pm right now. It's 10pm right over there. Yeah, it's 10pm right now. Can you hear me fine? Right? Yes, this is I hear you very well. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And how are you? Well, I'm training for the match for the Carolina Killer right now. He's coming in. Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes. Carolina Killer. Yeah. The severe underdog right now. According to them, you are underdog. According to me, it is an unknown. It's a big question mark.
SPEAKER_01: and I don't know how it is according to you. Hello, Hunter, how are you? What's going on? How you doing? How is everything? Wood? Doing good, doing good. Yeah, it's good to see you. Both of you. So, Hunter, we were talking about just before you came, Valen said that, you know, looks like I'm underdog.
SPEAKER_01: And I see a lot of people from your team or from your nation also think the same way. Do you also see yourself like heavily favored? I mean, here's my thing on it. I always, regardless of who the opponent is, I don't ever look over nobody. I just do what I have to do. And I have my confidence, you know.
SPEAKER_01: And that usually shows on match night. So, like I said, I just don't look over nobody. I treat everybody the same. I treat it as if I was going to pull LeVon. Uh-huh. Okay. For sure, I wouldn't say that much, but I understand you. Yeah. And it's not underdog. You have to add the word severe into it. Severely underdog. Okay. Dave you seen the comments on the Facebook? What? Which one? Like comments under my posts?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, under your post. Basically, it's everywhere. But who are making those comments? I mean, some of them are quite notable arm wrestlers from the United States. Okay, from United States. They have the confidence. And what does the people from Singapore think? I mean, from Singapore, obviously, Greek thinks that I have a chance. I can win. I can win Hunter. The rest of them is like, because we don't know what Hunter's strength is like. Therrien's no gauge.
SPEAKER_01: uh-huh so it's a question mark like you said it's a mystery right now uh-huh my my friend uh sol sol and he he he he talks very highly about you very highly you know man you you know so you know so right how he talks i mean he is so passionate about the uh people from his region and and i i liked it i liked it yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: And so can you tell us, Wale, like your best achievements? You know, I know you in the China Open, you took second to Mindaugas. Am I correct? And then I competed in the Arnold Classic Australia. I got first and second before. Which category? At that time I was competing 75 and 80 category. Oh, 75 and 80. Okay. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: and waft a long time back it was a asian championships i got first second at the asian championships yeah the asian asian championships but it's a while back okay so let me guess the first place was for kazakh the left hand first place was kazakh i was second and then the right hand i got first and number two is a kazakh and number three i think is a jika oh you won with the left hand
SPEAKER_01: I won with the right arm, the right arm. Oh, right arm. Oh, okay. Okay. At that time, the Asian championships was in, uh, Japan. So a lot of, uh, Japanese. Yeah, there was a lot of Japanese players. Okay. Okay. And Hunter, where, where do you rank yourself right now in this category in North America? People says you are like, okay, right now you are not 70 anymore.
SPEAKER_04: And I think Cody Wood is considered to be the best right now in 70. Yeah, at 70 kilograms, I think Cody Wood is number one as far as the U.S. But from 176 pounds to 170, I feel like I'm the man. I feel like I hold, I'm number one. And did you tell me once, or I missed,
SPEAKER_01: remember that you said that your left arm is better than your right arm or at least the same level? Yes, it's pretty much about the same. I had an injury with my left for a while and I finally got it back healed. I'm actually left-handed. You are left-handed, yeah. And how do you see, as of now at the training, how do you see your left and right? About the same? Yeah, they're pretty much the same, tit for tat.
SPEAKER_01: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I understand. Like, for example... I'm ready for a left-handed match at any given time. Listen, when you say it like this, you are just making me like, hello, Mindaugas, would you go to Arlington? Left arm. Would you pull him? Absolutely. I'll smash Mindaugas left-handed. Oh, wow, wow, wow. He won't take my hand. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Just wait one second. Just wait one second. Let me see if he's...
SPEAKER_01: Available or not. Yeah, call him. Get him on the phone. Okay, just wait one second. I like doing these kind of things. I love it. Life is better. But I like Mendoza a lot. I like him. I hung out with him in Orlando a good bit. No, I will tell him that you don't like him. Okay, that's better. He will accept the match. One second. Mendoza? You hear me? Yeah, I can hear you.
SPEAKER_01: Right now, I have two gentlemen as a podcast guest. Do you hear me? Give me one minute, I will go to a more quiet place. Okay, just we can continue talking. You will call me back or you will...
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I have a podcast with Valen Low and Carolina Killer, Hunter Knopf. And I was talking about, we just started the podcast and I was talking about his right arm and left arm, you know. Valen Low? Yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no. With Hunter. And Hunter said that he would kill you with left arm in Arlington. All right.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I mean, we can try the match if he wants. Oh, and he said he's ready. And, yeah. So you accept the match? But that would happen after the Janis match, right? Okay, we can do that way, yeah. But would it harm your concentration to have another match? Would it harm you about Janis?
SPEAKER_03: I guess no. My left is strong. I do have some minor injuries which normally don't really impact me so much when I warm up. How much would it matter if you are pulling Hunter? For the end of the match, it would not be impacted for sure. But how do you see Hunter compared to your level?
SPEAKER_01: I really think I can beat him on the left for sure. For sure? By ease or tough match? I'm just trying to think stylistically. He's just looking, right? I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I don't know. I guess it's me. You can never say too easy, but somehow... But you are saying that you would win for sure. This is what you are saying? Yes, yes, of course. Okay. And Hunter, would you like to say your feelings to Minda Agbas? I'll see you soon.
SPEAKER_01: But that's that, that short, you know, I see you soon. So, okay. Just after the podcast, let me talk with you and then we, we, we decide what, what to do. Okay. Okay. Take care. Right. Right. See, that's how you set the match at the West versus West. You know, I like that. I like that. Got him on the phone right away. Yes. That, that, that's how I do. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. So, um,
SPEAKER_01: You said that you wouldn't underestimate Valen or anyone. But you don't underestimate him. But what I feel, you are not planning to only
SPEAKER_01: win this match, I think you have like higher goals. That is how I feel every time I talk with you. And so if you are planning to win the title, you have such a goal, then you don't expect Valen to beat you. No, there's not a...
SPEAKER_04: Like I said, there's nothing against him, but I have my – I know what I'm doing leading into this. I've had quite a while training for this, even before I got hurt. You know, he's just another stepping stone of where I got to get to, and he just fell into place. You know what I'm saying? It's not his fault. He just fell into place of where I'm going. I see it 3-0, and in the end, I will be West versus West world champion.
SPEAKER_01: I respect that goal. And the same question to you, Vane. Do you also have such goal or right now you are only focused on Hunter? My goal is actually to be the 17 kg West vs West champion. Yes, I know. That is the category that you would feel comfortable. Yeah. And how do you see this match? And do you think that
SPEAKER_00: If you win this match, would it change your mind about the category? No, man. Evgeny if I win this match, I'm eating too much food for Hunter for this match. I'm forcing myself to eat even more weight to make it a little bit more even. What are you right now? 76? Right now? Yeah. Right now, this morning, I'm 78. 78? Oh, so you need to lose one kilo.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. So, so is, uh, we are fighting at 75, right? No, no. The category is seven, seven. Oh, I thought we, we, we agreed on Facebook a while back. You, you mentioned it was no, no, it's just, it's just seven, seven kilo category. Yeah. Oh, we are weighing in at 77. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you said 100 agreed to 75 a while back, a one month ago. No, no, no, no, no. We did the categories are, uh, uh, the, there, you know,
SPEAKER_01: What's Hunter's rate right now? I think he's also probably, what, 176? Yeah, about 176, 178. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so... Yeah, anyway, so how do you see your chance, Valen? I think if let's just say the first round, right? If Hunter's flash me, it'll be 3-0 to Hunter.
SPEAKER_01: But if I'm able to do anything in the first round, then it might be a tough match and I'm able to beat Hunter. You are saying that if you stop him in the round one, there is a chance that you will beat him? Yeah, but if let's just say he flashed me during round one, then it's very likely that it will be 3-0 to Hunter. But you don't have any other weapons? I mean, if you lose the round one, can you not do anything different on round two?
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you can try, but because Hunter is also very fast, right? So I have to be fast also. And then there might be a power disparity. So we don't know. Therrien's a mystery right now. The power disparity. Yeah. So that will be on the day itself to see which way it goes. Yeah, I understand. Yeah. Anyways, there are a few super chats I would like to read. Alicia says, Singaporean power, all the best to
SPEAKER_01: godfather valen and we have michael's workspace super excited for this match one second big fan of hunter i will be going to east versus west 17 in person can't wait to meet you engine hoping i can get a photo with you i won't be there my friend but i'm 100 sure uh you will enjoy
SPEAKER_01: Myham Armwrestling Worldwide, how long has Hunter been training for and his experience? So they're asking how long have you been armwrestling, I think? Six years now. Six years. And how old are you? I'm fixing to be 28. I'll be 28. And I heard that you have
SPEAKER_04: mma and wrestling past is that correct yeah i did uh i did some kickboxing and boxing for quite a few years growing up and i wrestled all through uh school wrestling so you are you are not you have been a
SPEAKER_04: combat athletes for i've been i've been in combat sports my whole life since i was four or five years old and like i said i've been i've started i started cutting weight probably when i was about 14. so i've been cutting weight for quite a while now
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And when you had a final with him, with Mindaugas in China, was it left arm or right arm? No, it was left arm. Oh, left arm. It was left arm. Okay. And what do you think if they pull against each other in Arlington, if you said this match? If what? Hunter against Mindaugas? Yeah, left arm. On the same day that he's pulling,
SPEAKER_00: Janis and Hunter is pulling you. I think it depends on whether Mindaugas will be able to get the stop. But I think Mindaugas will have the upper hand on Hunter. Because he's much more experienced, he knows. Unless, but I don't know, because Mindaugas said he has an injury, right, on the left?
SPEAKER_01: He said minor, minor problems, but I think Hunter also said that he has some minor problems, or is it okay now? Yeah, tell my dog that that ain't no excuse. You have no excuse? Oh, okay, okay. Tell him to not to excuse you as well. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so either don't accept the match or don't talk about anything, you know? Okay. Yeah, yeah. If he's hurt, don't accept it. If he accepts it, I don't want to hear no injury.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay. You don't want to hear all those things, you know. Okay, I understand. Yeah. That's why he's putting you on the phone. If he was 50 years old like me, he can talk about the injury. But not when he's so young, yeah. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_01: I think you have been following everything closely. Who are your favorite ones in the league? I mean, I really like, of course, all the main matches like Devon and Levan, the bigger matches.
SPEAKER_00: i also like i i also like how alijan is very dominant in the 105 and 115 because i've known him for many years and communicated with him many many years yeah so yeah he's one of my favorite on the left arm i understand i understand and you also follow everything uh hunter oh yeah oh yeah i watch very closely
SPEAKER_01: You watch very closely. And who are your favorite pullers from overseas? Because like you have been around other North Americans, but you haven't been over here. And also before that you answered, would you like to be competing at this side of the world as well?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, I definitely want to travel and and see the other side of the world and get a taste of, you know, just a different atmosphere. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So I definitely, I definitely want to do it in the future. Yeah. Okay. So let me keep that in mind and you can answer like, which Atlas do you like from overseas? Which Atlas excites you?
SPEAKER_04: You know, I watched a lot of Agrabah stuff, like on YouTube, like they're training, like they're, they're training camps and all the kids they have. I think that's awesome. You know, that's why I'm kind of ready to see how, how he does that. Cause he had a surgery, right? Yeah. He had the elbow surgery. They, they moved a small piece of bone. He showed me the photo and then.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and it will be nice to meet him there. Yeah, and I watched when he pulled Michael Todd, the way he pulled him was kind of similar to what Ermes did. He stayed calm. He stayed composed the whole time, never really ran out of breath. And he just stayed very, very composed and calm to win that match. And I like that. I watch a lot of their training videos. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Yes.
SPEAKER_01: And Ryan Bull Bellinger, Hunter hasn't been pinned in practice in last three months. Ooh. They are doing this psychological pressure on you, Valen. Devon't listen to them, Valen. Devon't listen to them. Devon't believe that. They tell me differently on the phone. I'm joking.
SPEAKER_00: anyways yeah and and you what like how is it to how what like are you excited to be on the stage yeah man i've been uh this this is the highest level of arm wrestling right and it's an honor to actually go and compete in his versus west so i've been training really hard and to prepare for hunter and for this match as well
SPEAKER_01: Looking forward to coming to Dallas. At some point, we need to give you a match for 70 kilos as well. Because that is your category. To be fair, I think that is how it should be, but let's see. Time will show. Hunter, just say...
SPEAKER_04: I mean, you say that you are planning to win this match. Is there anyone else that you would like to pull with right arm if you win this? I will win. After this, you know what I'm saying, we can just see how, see what you got in mind, see who you're looking for, who you want me to, if you want to throw me one or two more, but eventually, you know, by the end of this year, first of next year, I want that belt around my waist.
SPEAKER_01: I put in a lot of time and work, and I'm going to show you March 29th. I level up every time I get on that stage. I'm a different person every event. And would you like to pull the winner of Giannis and Mindaugas with right arm in a future event or you want to pull some of the other like more Eastern guys from
SPEAKER_01: Georgi, Kazakhstan. I think I have some good opponents for both of you. But you prefer more like 170, right, Hunter? Yeah, yeah. 170 is perfect. It's a perfect weight for me. Anything below it is just a little too much. But 170 is why I feel good. It's why I feel the best.
SPEAKER_01: And, yeah, and Waelen, if you win this one, you say that you want to go, doesn't matter you win this one or not, you want to go 150 for 70 kilo, correct? Yeah, man, that's where I feel actually most the best, most natural. And is there anyone that you would prefer to pull? Not at the moment, but I'm looking forward to pull the Europeans. Europeans. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Normally, normally we were set in this match.
SPEAKER_01: different opponents for Hunter. Thomas Mungy was going to pull. Do you know Thomas Mungy? He used to pull 65 or 17. Yes, yes. He gave some trouble to Aydar Khan and some guys when they were both 60 kilos, 65 kilos. And I think he had one match at the West Versus. Not that I think, but he had one match. He pulled Dustin Hyde.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, were you surprised to see how dominant he was?
SPEAKER_04: He, uh, Dustin just never, it's like he tried the same thing over and over and never really changed anything. And after that first one, I think, I think Thomas just kind of figured him out. And then once you figure somebody out and you get that rhythm, it's pretty much over with from there. I'm pretty sure he just got a feel after that first ready to go. He knew where Dustin was going to go and he stopped it pretty, pretty, pretty,
SPEAKER_01: fairly easy so then after that it was just pretty much the same result over and over and you you you like you like okay one guy says igor bull engine this is a total mismatch just another day in the office for valen
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so your side is not the only confident side. This side also looks confident while Wallen is playing some underdog strategy, but just, I wouldn't trust. It ain't gonna work. It ain't gonna work. You're not gonna underestimate him, right? You're not gonna underestimate him. No, okay. I take everybody serious, regardless of who they are. I'm just gonna do what I do. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And my hand...
SPEAKER_01: Armwrestling worldwide. Question for Wadden. Who do you think wins against Mike Ford? This is Matt Werangi. Asia versus New Zealand. I mean, definitely it will be Mike Ford. Michael Ford. Michael Todd. Is it Michael Ford or Michael Todd? No, Ford.
SPEAKER_00: Mike Ford. Mike Ford. I think it'll be close, man. It'll be a close match between the New Zealand number one and the Malaysian number one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways, yeah. And which match is your favorite match other than your own match at the West versus 17? I mean, for myself, I'd like to see how Cody does. You what? I'd like to see how Cody does.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, Cody Wood. Yeah. Versus Joseph. Yeah. Maybe you would like to pull against the winner of them? Yeah, of course. At the 70 kilowatt, right? But they are pulling at 77, right? Yes, yes. Because they don't have time to cut weight there. Yeah. And yours? You said Mindaugas versus Janis match?
SPEAKER_04: I really like that match because they're kind of similar, somewhat similar in style. So it's going to be a top role battle.
SPEAKER_04: would you know when they both pull in and it's kind of cool like they're both of my class top of my class so i get to watch it firsthand in person to see you know what i'm working with for us in the future and i like both of them i've liked both of them ever since i've got into the sport uh i'd like a lot of them so i think but right now like you said i think
SPEAKER_04: This is kind of Mendoza's time. Now, if it had been seven, eight years ago, I'd say Giannis, no problem. But now, as far as in your peak performances and the way the age is, I think Mendoza is going to shake it up a little bit. Yeah. It's going to be a very, very technical match.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, very, very like interesting category at the world level. Like Arthur Makarov beat Mindaugas. Mindaugas beat Daniel Prokopchuk. Daniel Prokopchuk beat Alan Zolaev. Alan Zolaev beat Arthur Makarov. Mindaugas beat Cherkasov. And Cherkasov beat Arthur. Arthur beat
SPEAKER_01: It's just like, I mean, like, so someone needs to... Yeah, yeah, the style makes, you know, matches, you know, and changing the results, you know. I don't believe... What's that? How about that? Therrien's the Omer, right? Therrien's a Turkish guy with a mutant forearm. Yeah, yeah, he's very, very good. But he lost against Makaro, if you watch in West vs. 15. Makaro beat him, and...
SPEAKER_01: So he's definitely very, very good, but there is no clear dominance by anyone in that category. I can say one match, maybe the champion will change. I said another match, and the same guys will be, unless things change and someone dominates. Who do you think is the
SPEAKER_01: uh toughest guy in that category i believe uh
SPEAKER_04: I think it's between Arthur and Mendoza. Arthur, Mendoza, and Daniel. You know, those three guys is where the belt has been. It's kind of changed. It always went back and forth, and those guys have always been. It's like a group of them that just stay at the top, and it just interchanges between all of them. Well, who wins? One may win one day. One may win the next day.
SPEAKER_01: But I feel my honest opinion is Arthur Daniel Mindaugas is sort of top three of the class for us in today's era. Okay. Donnie Anderson says Bush lights and cornbreads. He about to find out. I don't know what that means. What does that mean? I love cornbread milk. Like you eat cornbread milk.
SPEAKER_01: okay that's that's that's american food right yeah american food cornbread milk okay okay and
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we will see. We will see. And how far do you see yourself compared to them? I will ask you about 77-kilo category and I will ask Valen for 70-kilo category, even though if Valen beats you or not, I don't know about that one. Okay, one more question, Valen, before that. You said that if you stop him, round one, like when you say like you stop him,
SPEAKER_01: Like, do you see your chances higher in a match that is stopped? Like, do you feel yourself stronger and Hunter faster? Or how do you do that calculation? Because Hunter would likely use his signature style, a lot of disciplination. So if I'm able to stop him or flash him,
SPEAKER_00: then with the stop, there will be a higher possibility and I feel more confident, of course, to engage from there. But you cannot be stopped in this position. Yeah, you are saying in your comfortable position. In a neutral position. Do you consider yourself
SPEAKER_04: as an explosive puller or endurance guy actually i like to i like to be i'm more explosive explosive and hunter is also explosive yeah yeah and hunter you you are very explosive but you can also pull forever yeah i feel like my endurance is it's pretty good i've always a lot of people think it's just speed and i don't have no endurance on those strings but that's
SPEAKER_01: But mainly when I train, I feel like my endurance is up there with the best in the world. And the question again, I will repeat, how close do you see yourself to those mentioned guys, like top guys, top five, six guys in the world that can beat anyone? And which one would you like to pull in short term? Like for myself?
SPEAKER_04: No, no, I'm asking Hunter first and then I will ask you. You know, in all honesty, I feel like I'm right there, like I'm knocking on their door.
SPEAKER_04: You know, any of those guys right there in that top, you know, I'm not going to be picky on saying I want to pull this certain guy. You know, any of those guys right there in that top five, top three, all you got to do is call me and sign me up. I'm ready.
SPEAKER_04: like i said i gotta handle business with valent first once i get through with that we don't we'll we'll see what what the world brings us and and what you got in your mind at the time and i i feel like i'm right there knocking on their door so i feel like i can stand with any with any of them okay so you don't you don't have the reverse shift it's all forward shift
SPEAKER_01: All forward. All forward, no reverse, yeah, okay. All gas, no brakes. I cut the brake line. That's good, that's good, that's good. And Valen, right now we have Daniel Ustinov as the champion. One question, how is your left and right compared to each other, Valen? My right is now much stronger than the left arm.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, how come did you take second to Minda Agos with left and not with the right? Is it because the competition with right arm was higher level than left? Because on that day, if you remember, there's no Joffrey Jolly, right? What's that? No Joffrey Jolly. Oh, yeah, from Malaysia. Yeah, I had quite a long match and I won him and then he's like gassed out on the right. You beat him once there?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I beat Joffrey War. He's a strong guy, very strong guy. Yeah, he's a strong guy. Yeah, but with the left arm right now, I haven't been training the left arm for five, six weeks just for this match. Oh, okay, because of this match. Yeah, I understand. Do you see yourself close to Daniel Bustinov? Or you need more time?
SPEAKER_00: No, like Daniel Yustinov is like here. Let's say Daniel Yustinov and the top guys is like here, right? Yeah. Probably at here, but I've been thinking like, has this been long enough? I need to try to chase the guys, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'm not getting any younger engines. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How old are you, by the way? I'm 31. 31? Yeah. 31, you're still a kid. I mean, I still got 10, 15 years left, but.
SPEAKER_01: early one wow and and and they call you godfather ah then early okay yeah because i started this whole arm wrestling in singapore and southeast asia and started competing australia china japan and uh-huh so you are you are the the representative at the beginning you know yeah i understand yeah since 15 16 years old yeah anyways yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay. Mindaugas just wrote, Mindaugas says that Engin, I understand that, you know, Hunter cannot, you know, say that he doesn't want to pull me because he's on live podcast now, but tell him to feel comfortable to say no privately. I will just say it's okay. I'm joking.
SPEAKER_01: I think it would be a good match, but let me think about it. I'm serious about it, but let me see how we can do, but we can really privately talk about it. I think it would be beautiful.
SPEAKER_01: It is ready. Ready, huh? That's the Mundogus killer. It's called Mundogus killer, right? Yeah. Mundogus killer. Yeah. Humble him, Hunter. I think neither of you are humble, but better you humble him than he is humble me. Everybody's a lion until you get in there with another lion. Then you find out what kind of lion you are. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Therrien is another super chat. I believe Hunter will be West vs West World Champion in the near future. He just needs the opportunity. I saw him pull live at a tournament in Houston. Super, he says.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so let's talk about the matches. So you said that it is Mindaugas' time. Mindaugas is going to win in Ireland. What do you think? Against Giannis, is it? What's that? Against Giannis? Yeah, yeah, yeah. The Arlington event, yeah. Yeah, I think Mindaugas will take the win. Yeah? Wow. But it's going to be 3, you know what I mean? It's not going to be an E. Like, I don't see it 3-0 either way.
SPEAKER_04: I see it. 3-2, 3-1, Mendoza. Okay. So, Cody versus Joseph. I think Cody runs Thule. Were you surprised when Joseph beat Kevin Palko? Not really. Not really. The first round kind of surprised me when Kevin stopped him.
SPEAKER_04: But after that, I kind of felt like in the back of my head that Joseph would be the more powerful guy. But I think Cody Wood takes this pretty convincingly. I think Cody, he's a good rising star from here in America at 154 pounds. Do you think he can make 154?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah. He made 154 in December. But it looks like he's getting bigger. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I talked to him a little bit. He said that 54 is going to be where he wants to compete for internationally. Now, it may change. I don't know. This is what I've talked to him. I feel like 54 has got good weight for him.
SPEAKER_01: And Hualien, how do you see this match? You know, Joseph from the King of the Table. Yeah, Joseph won Kelvin Palko, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think right now, Cody Wood is the favorite for this match. Favorite and the strongest, probably 154 in North America. I understand. Okay. And John Therrien versus Craig Tullier.
SPEAKER_04: That's going to be a really, really good one. Now, Craig, if he doesn't smash John straight to the pad with that sideways hit like he normally does, if John were to stop it, I think Craig could be in trouble because John has been looking really good here lately. He's been looking very solid. I think
SPEAKER_04: Craig's in for a day. It's not going to be an easy win. You know, everybody says experience, and with Craig being the veteran in the situation, you know, that always kind of gives them the upper hand. But like I said, the way I watch, when John beat Brandon L. Sessner, I mean, he beat him pretty, with a flat wrist.
SPEAKER_04: Where do you match the goal? Inside, you expect it to go inside and end it. If the match stops, is it going to be inside or is it going to be outside stop? How do you expect it? I think John can stop him inside. I think Craig's hand may be a little too much, but if it goes inside, I believe John will take it. As far as inside raw power, I think John will take it.
SPEAKER_04: But you are saying that Craig is more explosive while John will have better endurance? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so. But like I say, Craig, he's been the man for a while now, so you can't ever overlook him. I'm going to say 3-2, Craig. But like I say, if it goes inside, I believe John can turn the whole match around.
SPEAKER_00: And Valen? I think for this match, because Craig has much more experience, it'll be nice to see John take some wins, but I think ultimately Craig will take the win. So you are thinking Craig will win? Yeah, yeah. Okay, but you are hoping that John also will win some rounds? Yeah, and if he can win, like even 3-0, 3-1, it'll be nice. Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I'd like to see John pull the upset. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so, Sarah versus Jocelyne. That's going to be, I think that's a good woman's matchup. For number one? Number one in North America, yeah. I watched them pull that round robin they had.
SPEAKER_04: And I think that's when Jocelyne beat her. And she looked really strong. So hopefully, I'd like to see Sarah pull it off. I'd like to see Sarah come back and, you know, redeem herself and get her win back. But I think she's in for it. You know, as long as she's healthy and stuff, just because I think Sarah can maneuver and pull off some stuff. I'm going to say Sarah 3-2. Sarah 3-2?
SPEAKER_01: 3-2, but very, very close. And you, Walid? I think the... Who is that? The other one? Jocelyne. Last year, she beat Sarah. She's from Canada, but Sarah is about 78 kilos, and Jocelyne is in the plus category. And there is a weight difference, but Sarah is...
SPEAKER_01: Usually known to be pulling every category. I saw her photos and she looks much bigger than Sarah. But Sarah has much more experience. So I think Joyce Lee will win. Joyce Lee will win? Yeah. Okay. Todd and Oleg's love child says, Engin Terzi, greatest promoter, strongest pronator.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. But yeah, I have strong pronator. Maybe someday, someday, you know, again, who knows, you know, I trained yesterday. I'm happy. Wow. I think today I will also do some chest training and maybe maybe I'll come back. But I love I love to come back, you know, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I have some wins against most of the top guys in those categories that you see today. But I don't know if I can do it again or not. I don't know. And then you eventually beat Makarov again. Yeah, Makarov in the second match, he was lucky about the bicep tear that I had. But first one, yeah, he was better for sure.
SPEAKER_01: and let's go let's go to the next one and let's talk about wild horse versus ongar web look look at hunter looks happy about this match i i i really like this match yeah just the way matt is yeah but
SPEAKER_04: You know, it's – if he's back 100% healthy, Matt has to be the best version of himself to pull this one off. Because those college-standing guys, they're different. They're – like I say, I watch them closely. I'm a fan of Agrabahoff, and I think Matt's got his hands full. I'd like to see Matt pull it off. I really do. I'm rooting for him.
SPEAKER_01: But if I had to bet, I'm going to have to say Agrabah 3-1. Hunter, your personality is... How to say? Like...
SPEAKER_01: You don't give a shit, but you just say your opinion. And about Craig, also from the US, a lot of people, their opinion is a little bit shadowed with their patriotic feelings of friendship, but you still say you want this guy to win, you will be happy, but you think this way as well, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that is interesting. And I like it. I like it. Because when you have that one way of thinking, listen, it's also the same with me. If I would be not an organiser and if I would be talking about
SPEAKER_01: like my friends from here you know his match I would also be not so show a little bit of favoritism yeah yeah but it looks like you don't you don't have that you are like okay whatever in your mind you know you just say it you know it's good it's good yeah people are usually afraid to be taken wrong you know why don't you
SPEAKER_00: to support your countrymen, you know? And that is very understandable, you know? And Valen, how do you see this match? Ongarbaev versus Matt Mask. I mean, with Ongarbaev coming from the Shadarra team, I got to give it to Ongarbaev. If Matt Mask were to put a stop, he has to be like really 100% because this Shadarra team is really no joke. Too many champions are coming out of this team.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but at the West versus West stage, nobody is a joke. Yeah, definitely. As I say all the time, as I say what Neil says,
SPEAKER_01: Therrien's a Jurassic Park, he calls that stage, Jurassic Park, with all kind of monsters. Yeah, I mean, it is good that, you know, we are representing our sport at this level to the whole world, you know, and people can see. I think there will be some crazy level. You are very fired up when you are pulling.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that also adds a lot of excitement. What will we see, Valen? Will we see a quite respectful guy from Asia, or are we going to also see a fired-up guy? I have to be fired up for Hunter, I have to match his fitness.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah that's what we're doing yeah yeah now we can do something yeah it'll be entertaining you know yes yes yeah i love it i love it yeah as long as we know deep inside
SPEAKER_04: We all respect each other because... Yeah, it's all respect. It's just, you know, for that little bit of time, I got to show you that I'm better. That's it. And athletes, it's all we all back friends, you know. It's the same thing with fighting, any other competitive sport. It's all respect at the end. Yeah. And Wallen also will try to show you that he is better. You're going to try to show him you are better and we will see.
SPEAKER_01: So you are saying, you both are saying that Ongarbaev is the favorite for this match. This is what I understood. Then let's go to the next one. Andrei Sharkevich versus Arsen Khachatryan. I've only, I watched him pull one time in that round robin in Arizona. And I believe, I believe Sharp won that one.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. And Shark, he's been on a winning streak here lately. Yes. He's been tearing through everybody, so... Yeah. And I don't really know too much about Arsen. I've seen a little bit of him, and he looks... He's young, isn't he? Isn't he really young? Oh, the Arsen is young, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think he's younger than 25 for sure. Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm...
SPEAKER_04: I think Andrei, I think Andrei would take this one. Pretty, I believe, I believe Arsen, Arsen would definitely get a win, at least one. But I think overall, I think Andrei's still a little too much for him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, like I said, he could, I do see him getting a win. I could see Arsen getting a win, but I just feel in the overall final, I think Andrei would take it. I think he's too much.
SPEAKER_00: He's been looking very, very dominant here lately. And Waelen? Is Arsen living in... He's Armenian, right? Is he living in... Yeah, yeah. He is originally, yes. He lives in California lately. That's what I know. I recently saw Andrei put in one of the tournaments in the Arnold Classic, I think. And he won quite convincingly. And I knew one of the Korean guys managed to put
SPEAKER_04: quite a match with him and took a little bit of the wrist. So I think I can't decide for this match 50-50. 50-50. Okay. Cody Merritt versus Evgeny Prudnik. Left arm. Ooh. If... It's going to be a close one. It depends on if Prudnik's back...
SPEAKER_04: Is he back healthy? Is he back to his normal size? Because I think Cody's left arm is really good. If it was right-handed, I would say prudent. But left-handed, I'm going to go with Cody. I think, like I said, I just think because Cody, there are different weight classes, right? Yeah, yeah. I mean, as of now, with the weight that he has,
SPEAKER_04: Prudnik is heavyweight, while Cody is super heavyweight. What's Prudnik weighing, you know? It's about 250, near 250, yeah, around there, 250, yeah. Yeah, I'm going to still go with Cody. I think he's still got the size and power over him. I think it'll be a good match. I think it'll be a war, but I think Cody's able to pull that off just with his size.
SPEAKER_00: I understand. And you, Wale? Yeah, Cody won the WAF World Championships before and then he got the left arm, right? And then Prudnik, I haven't seen him pull in a while. But I want to go for the lighter guy, man. I want to go for Prudnik this time. You want to go or you think he's going to win? I think he's going to win. I'm going to go for Prudnik. Okay. Okay. I understand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: um okay then let's go to the next one we have devon versus corey west left arm you know it's it's hard to bet against devon you know he's always got something up to the sleeve that he pulls off or
SPEAKER_04: Whatever it is he does, he's very hard to bet against. But I don't know. It's a tough one. I'm going to say it's a 50-50 on that one. It depends on how – if Corey comes in, he can just take him to the pad. Like, who was it? Who did Devon pull left-handed in the long wars? Was it Camille Jablonski? Camille, yeah, yeah. And he –
SPEAKER_04: Press Devon right to the pad. Yeah. If Corey, I don't know. I just think that's a 50-50 match. It's going to be hard to call that one. And you, Valen? Yeah, man, with Devon, he's got a lot of tricks. And it's a little bit hard to call, but I'm going to go with Devon. Okay. And Dave Chaffee versus Gilgis-Retko?
SPEAKER_04: If Dave shows up, you know, like he normally does, I think Dave can pull it off. I think he's going to – I think statistically people may think he's the underdog, but I think Dave's fully capable of beating Georgi. I really do. I think I'm going to say 70-50 Dave.
SPEAKER_00: 70-30? No, 70-50. 70-30, I mean, yeah. 70-30, yeah. Okay, yeah. And Walem? Yeah, I also agree because with Dave, right, when he was a king of the table, he stopped and had a war with Vitaly, right? Yeah. I haven't seen Dave pull for the right arm for quite a while. No, he just pulled in last December. He beat the current world champion from Hungary. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah like on the with like vitaly and all and then georgie he just coming back from so really depends george george beats terhi kalnichenko as his last match yeah uh the king of the table 12. king on the table right yeah yeah it was a interesting match yeah i want to go with dave man for this match okay and then let's go to the match of the gods
SPEAKER_04: John Bersink versus Yoshinobu Kanai. I just watched the thing on Facebook, all the years of John and him pulling from like 1999, 2002, 2005. That's going to be a war, but I think John's still able to do it. I think John's still able to pull off one more win with him.
SPEAKER_01: Did you guys watch the match between Kanai and Tata Shins at the West vs West 15? Yeah. What did you guys, were you guys surprised? Yeah, surprised man. Yeah, he does definitely, he definitely put up a good fight. Yeah, Kanai has that, on the last part he has that sticking point.
SPEAKER_01: Listen, I knew one thing. If Yoshinobu Kanai was in shape and if somehow he would stop the match somewhere, even here, I knew it was going to be war. I knew that because to finish him, you need shoulder pressure, which Todd doesn't have. And once the match stopped, I knew that it was going to be war. And it was incredible. It was incredible. This guy to come.
SPEAKER_01: Like after so many years of being absent and now having such a great match with Tata Shinks, I was, I was, I was amazed, you know, and after the match I told him, I told, is that your, your kid? Yes. Yeah. He just woke up. Hey, what's your name? Brayton. Brayton. Nice to meet you Brayton.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, you're also going to beat Mindaugas? Yes, sir. Mindaugas killers. Yeah. New ones are coming. Yeah, that's good. That's good. He's already training. He's only five. I've already got him training.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, that's great. Therrien will be more problems from the North family. That's right. Yeah, that's good. That's good. Yeah. And you are from, like, you guys also consider, like, that area, like, including Japan, like, where you are representing? Like, do you feel like both you and Kanai are representing the same region?
SPEAKER_00: Or yeah, almost like an West Asia, but I'm more like I'm from Southeast Asia because I have connections with the Chinese arm wrestling, right? Tons of Chinese arm wrestlers trying to promote the pay-per-view over in China. Yeah. So now this is more like Southeast Asia, China region. Yeah. Is can I known?
SPEAKER_01: over there as a legend, like around that. He is, right? The biggest legend that's coming out of this region. Yeah, he's worldwide recognized as a legend here. Incredible. And now, how is this going to happen with John? Who's winning this one? I think Kanai will get that stop at the last part and see whether John will be able to push down, but I'm going to go with Kanai.
SPEAKER_01: But how about, you know, every time they pull, the times that John wins, at the end, John goes with the... Because Kanai is just pulling back and then the pressure to this side. If you try to pull back to Kanai, it's problematic because he's pulling like a tractor, you know. He's pulling, you know, yeah. And even Tatashin with side pressure, he had a very hard time to beat this guy. And we know Tatashin's side pressure is just like, I mean...
SPEAKER_01: like incredible, you know, like, just like, I'm sure no one in this podcast would like to feel that that hit, you know, and, and, but, you know, I know if the weight was closer, maybe you guys would like to, but with such a weight difference, I'm sure you guys wouldn't want as well. Um, but, but,
SPEAKER_01: John, every time he wins against Kanai, he does that. So I just think that John needs to take the match to his winning side. If he takes the match to his winning side, and then I think it's possible to finish this way. But if the match is going that way, I don't know if John can bring it there. He has some shoulder issues. So you are saying that Kanai is going to win, Valen?
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to go with Kanai, man. Okay, how much objective opinion? How much is the regional, you know, support in that opinion? Objective opinion, 60%. Okay, okay. And remind us again, Hunter, you say that John is going to win? Yeah, I agree with you. Like you said, as long as John gets on his side, I just, he'll finish it with that press. But like, he doesn't,
SPEAKER_01: He's sticky, but I believe John's able to get it to his side. He'll finish him with a press. So I would say John. Okay. And before we finish this one, Hermes versus Levan Saginashvili for world's number one again. They pulled once, and then Hermes really surprised us, you know, with the breaks. And
SPEAKER_01: what do you guys think they do you guys people like if anyone says that levan is not favorites against anyone i think that wouldn't be a serious opinion levan is favorite against anyone but how much chance do you guys think uh erma says our reasons looked the way he when he pulled michael todd he looked very very strong very dominant very solid and well-rounded and
SPEAKER_04: from their last match the way ermy's had him with a bent wrist all the way back and was pretty close to pinning him like you say levon's always going to be the favorite because i mean he's ran through everybody multiple times but you know devin's had his chance
SPEAKER_04: Now, Hermes is back on his second chance. It's between Devon and Hermes, I believe, have the biggest chances out of everyone right now to beat LeVon. Not saying they will, but I think statistically they have the biggest chances on at least getting a win. I'm not saying beat him three times, but at least getting a pin on him.
SPEAKER_04: Uh-huh. And hard time, difficult time. Yeah, but to pin LeVon three times in the super match, that's going to be a big deal. That's going to be a big job for anybody. Yeah. I do feel Devon or Hermes are probably the biggest factors in at least getting at least one win on LeVon. I understand. And how you see that, Valen? Yeah, I think with LeVon, he's like the...
SPEAKER_00: great one of the greatest so super difficult with that because Levan has mutated hands as well man for us even for the super heavyweight very super big hands and Hermes he seems like he got even stronger with the with the Michael Todd match but I think Levan Levan will win yeah but whether it's close or not that's that's another thing with the bicep power he
SPEAKER_01: after a few matches at the king of the table lavan gas out a little bit with the bicep power yeah yeah yeah anyways guys you you hear me you see me yeah yeah yeah okay yeah i thank you very very much for your uh uh for joining us and with the fans and i wish you guys um a healthy
SPEAKER_01: preparation i don't know how much more you guys are gonna train and let the stronger one win any any last words to the fans or anyone make sure y'all tune in you ain't gonna want to miss this one yep yeah get the pay-per-view the whole of singapore and southeast asia don't run from me mendoza
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, soon, soon, very soon. I will talk with him, and then let's see where it is going to end up. Anyways, guys. Wood, just tell me. Yeah, take care, guys, and thanks once again.
