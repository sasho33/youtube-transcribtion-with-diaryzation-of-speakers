SPEAKER_00: Neil Pickup, he said he restarted his Wi-Fi and soon he will be with us. And so we can just have a very nice conversation about arm wrestling. Oh, yeah, he just came. He just came. Hello, Neil.
SPEAKER_01: Therrien he is. Did I beat you live then, mate? Yeah, maybe like already 10 seconds or 15 seconds, yeah. I just, yeah, I didn't know when you were coming. I'm never even on time on my own channel, never mind. Guys, is one of us lagging? You know, I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: i've just rebooted my uh wi-fi router so hopefully yeah now is yes a while ago it was still lagging i mean from my side yeah yeah so how is everything new yeah i'd have been better if my wi-fi router works gave me all kind of problems on sunday night i had to i had to cancel the fix so i got to um i bought these little boosters
SPEAKER_02: little booster boxes and hopefully they worked but we will see oh wow i'm just getting people saying i've got bad wi-fi guys i don't know what's going on i don't know what's going on with my wi-fi i have literally just got two boosters i've just done everything it told me to do rebooted the router everything's i don't know what the freak is going on
SPEAKER_01: Amazing. How's life in the fast learning in Jersey? That's good. We have month of Ramadan, fest and days and for one month and yeah, everything is fine. Everything is fine. Yeah. Do you agree that even though it is your native language, English, and the English is spread from your country, do you agree that it is still
SPEAKER_01: especially some regions in England, it is very hard to understand. Unbelievably hard. Craig Sanders is talking. Craig Sanders talks 10 seconds. I try to understand and I don't listen anymore because my brain gets burned. Yeah. Therrien's a story there because Craig Sanders is married to an incredible woman, a lady called Rose.
SPEAKER_02: They've been married years. And I said to him once, I said, how come, you know, you're punching above your weight there. How come you managed to pull Rose? And he told me actually she didn't understand him when he asked her to marry him. And she was too embarrassed to say that. So that's what ended up happening there. Yeah, true story.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. You heard that, yeah. And then did she also say that the more they get to know each other later, she said, oh, I totally misunderstood you. That's why I married you. But now... 100%. Can't understand a thing he says ever. But I love Craig Sanders, though. I'm sure whatever he is saying to me, I love it. Yeah. Yeah. Arsen you all ready for Arlington?
SPEAKER_01: everything in place all the athletes confirmed and everything yes yes we will announce one one or two more matches and then we will finalize everything and yeah so what i did my point was that like you are probably the most clear english guy that i understand but yeah i will still
SPEAKER_01: Therrien is something also, there is another problem that because of the US, you understand, but never, never, never. Like I have been in England, I can't be in Manchester waffles that you organize. But about the cultural part, you know that 90% of the jokes that you make, I don't understand.
SPEAKER_01: I do get this. You're still doing those jokes. And then whenever I read here, people say, oh, Engin, again, didn't understand. Engin is slow. It's not because I'm slow, because I don't understand what you are saying. Listen, when we've spoken before, I've said, probably not 90. Let me think. Realistic total. I'm going to say that whenever I'm online, whenever I'm online, I would say...
SPEAKER_02: 75 of everything i say outside of some match predictions yeah is i'm i'm taking a piss i'm joking most of the time okay so let's make a deal let's make a deal with you and we talk about arm wrestling because you would be joking by yourself of course yeah i can't i can't it's hard to do when we're just talking arm wrestling
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You put me down and make me serious, Engin. And I really mean that. Yeah, you guys, I'm 100% sure that you have never met anyone who is more serious about arm wrestling than myself.
SPEAKER_01: never never i've never met anybody that's more serious about anything than yourself you are the most serious guy i have ever met in my life listen listen you only see me when i'm competing and when i'm organizing if you see me outside of the like arm wrestling then like like i mean with the people who i'm comfortable like i'm i'm barely serious i'm barely serious yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but whenever I'm organising, I'm on a mission. When I'm competing, I'm on a mission. But other than that, yeah. When you were competing, you were more than on a mission. A lot of people think they're focused. When you were competing, you were absolutely focused.
SPEAKER_02: i've never seen anything like that in my life yeah turned into a absolutely psychopath psychopath oh yeah proper lunatic yeah yeah absolute nutcase i mean when we did that when we did that um review and you said um you were in the bath in america and you were contemplating cutting your own arms yeah because i took second place in the world you know i took second place in the world
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and that was a really bad time. Seems logical, mate. Funny. Funny stuff, dude. Yeah, I was pretty serious, you know. I mean, I wasn't going to cut, but I was just telling my arms that they deserved to be cut because I took second in the world, you know. Second place. Therrien result. Yeah, terrible, terrible. I was in the army for one and a half years. I didn't really get prepared. And then I got out of the army, two, three months preparation and competed. Yeah, I took second, yeah. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_01: Let's talk about arm wrestling. I think that whenever I'm talking... What about this, right? What about this? Why don't we have an exclusive star right now announce the last match? Announce the last match? Who's it going to be? Who's the extra match? Therrien are two of them. One of them is... I'm hoping to be confirmed this evening. But the other one is... Let me...
SPEAKER_01: Let me announce. Do you know, just to pronounce the name correctly, I don't even know, Alan Barberis? Barberis? You know, the guy from France that he beat? He's the guy that is being… Yes, I do know him. He beat Leonidas at the Swiss Open. Yes, I do know him. He beat Leonidas Arcona, and his opponent is Andrei Sharkevich. Yeah, and Shark's been pulling really well.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and this guy is also very good, this French guy, Alain. Yeah, and I think, what weight class is that, at 95 or 105? No, 105 kilos. Ooh. Because I was just going to say, if Barbaris is dropping weight, I think it probably favours Sharp. Sharp's quite dry, but at 105, that's a good match, an interesting match. I think Barbaris might be slightly more technical, Sharp a little stronger. Very interesting.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. And Dino is asking a question. He says, when you will compete again and become champion in 85 kilos, that will probably never, ever happen. I mean, I may compete, but to become a champion in 85 kilos, beating Samusha, I don't know. You know you want to do it.
SPEAKER_01: Ah, okay, I will tell you one more story. Ahmet Burak Altıncı, merhaba kardeşim. Love you guys, he says. Yeah. Oh, listen, you want to do it is, yeah. Do you know how it's happening like last five, six years? I decide something in my head because I just think that the price is as used to be. And then whenever I start doing it, I'm like,
SPEAKER_01: okay, why am I doing this in the health way? When I'm losing the weight, when I'm training, trying to heal the injuries, and I'm like, why do you do this? Why did you? It's interesting, though, isn't it? Because when you start to train, well, even basic stuff, if you start to try and train basic stuff now, I find that whenever I do that, I get injured straight away. I think we need to do first healing.
SPEAKER_01: with the way to play with them. Quite a long time as well, probably, of lightweights to get, you know, or something. But whenever I try to do anything of significance, I get hurt quick. When we were young, never got hurt. Paying the price was not big. Now,
SPEAKER_01: Losing the weight is a problem. Injuries are a problem. I would just walk by the seaside, you understand? Seaside. I walked by the seaside. They tried to roll me in the sea. Yeah, and I would just jump on a tree and then suddenly no warm-up, nothing. Winter or summer. Boom. One arm pull-up. You understand? Now, I have the small gym downstairs and it's warm and I need to do half an hour
SPEAKER_02: warm up, and then I can do two-arm pull-up and still hurt. Yeah, mate, it sucks getting old. Really sucks. Because sometimes you do think, you know what, I'd love to just one more time be able to do it, you know? I mean, I don't think I'd be ever competitive again.
SPEAKER_02: world level because i'm too screwed up but certain matches that you could try and motivate yourself for
SPEAKER_02: You know, that would be quite, I mean, I'd love to pull John in a six rounder at some point. I just would. I just like to do it again. We were once on the fix and I talked to him about it and he said, yeah, that'd be quite cool. And if I could ever get fit, I'd love to do it. I mean, the chances of it happening are bloody a lot slimmer than I am now, but I just would, you know, and I like to do it. But it's just getting yourself fit. It's how you, it's very hard. One guy says, so you are saying training was easier back in the,
SPEAKER_01: 20th century, no, it was not. I mean, it was easy for us because we were not hurt. We were young. And I would eat whatever I want, no fat. And whatever I do, no pain. Yeah, I mean, it has nothing to do with the 20th century. It is when you're young compared to when you're old, you know. When you're old, you are...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. And also, it is not only about the age. It is about how much damage you are. I have a theory that it's the volume of arm wrestling that you did. And I arm wrestled a lot, like a stupid amount. And I arm wrestled hard a stupid amount. And I think that's the problem. I mean, you look at someone like... If you look at Todd Zilla, for example, got into the sport quite late. About 35, 36. Hasn't got the same miles on the clock.
SPEAKER_02: no i started arm wrestling i was 12 years old you know and when i got to sort of 15 i was arm wrestling hard from 15. like yeah both arms never stopped um i don't necessarily think it's healthy and the worst thing is going up through the weight categories pulling multiple weight classes going against the supers going against the big guys if i had my time over probably wouldn't do that
SPEAKER_02: Probably wouldn't do that. At the time, it seemed like a good idea because it was that no lose situation. But in actuality, I think it's a shit idea. I don't regret anything that I have done it because if I wasn't that cracked in the head, I wouldn't be successful. Yeah. Listen, if you weren't completely nuts, you wouldn't have done what you've done. A lot of people that get to exceptional level in anything are nuts.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. I haven't seen anyone. Listen, even the guys who look normal, inside of them, they are not normal. You look at John Bersink, you think he's a normal guy. Inside of him, he's holding like 90% of it. You barely see him when he shows it, but then you understand when he shows it, he's not as...
SPEAKER_01: Inside, he's not as calm as he looks, you know, from outside. Also, John is the exception rather than the rule in many ways. John is designed for the sport. I don't think he's normal either. I don't think so. He's just a quiet one. Quiet one. You understand? Yeah. Very, very, very exceptional. But he's nowhere near as nuts as you and Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_02: You and Michael Todd are, I mean, Michael Todd is incredibly driven. Michael Todd took the loss against Hermes. And the next morning I traveled back with him, right? We traveled to the airport. And he already wanted to pull Levan again straight away. I know, I know, I know. He has reached me out, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and what a weapon that is. Think about that. What a weapon. That's a fantastic weapon to have where you're that irrepressible. Devon't bother it. You know, he was heavily invested in that match. Came up short. Boom, let's go again. Straight back in there. Yeah, I wouldn't do what he does because we already made agreement that, you know, the winner was going to take, you know, Levan. But, yeah. But he would have done it.
SPEAKER_01: What's that? But he would have done it, and that's a great thing. But for me, you know... No, no, I wouldn't because I would just think that I didn't deserve it, you understand? I wouldn't really ask a match with Levan right away. I would just think that I would need to beat someone or some people. Is it now confirmed that he's pulling Vitaly, mate? Or is that not confirmed? Yes, yes, it is. See, I love that match. You know what? I will tell you something. A lot of people... Today, I had a podcast with Vitaly.
SPEAKER_01: And he said, he thinks Michael is more difficult than Devon. Stylistically, he says to finish him, he said, like, I mean, listen,
SPEAKER_01: If he, like, what is Vitaly good about it? Vitaly is good about the center. Vitaly is good about taking the hand. And, like, maybe he can do this both to Devon and Michael. But even if he takes this to finish it with such advantage, to me, Michael is, like, more, like, Devon has better hand control than Michael. His wrist hand better.
SPEAKER_01: But Michael can still pull in weird positions, you understand? Yes, stop. Yeah, so that is what I am saying. Like, I mean, I see Devon, except whenever he's going for the opener, but still his hand and wrist, I see him more, like, closer to the orthodox style than Michael. Devon can do this, this, very effectively, everything. So he's kind of divided, you know, to many things, you know.
SPEAKER_01: While Michael is, of course he can do the shoulder pressure, but it is more like an opportunity to hunt the guy suddenly and beat him. But his main style, I can say 98% is this thing.
SPEAKER_02: about this thing i think michael is better than them i'm talking about this thing and the kings move yeah yeah it's going to be interesting to see whether that plays out to be the case i actually don't agree with vitaly that michael is more dangerous for him i think they're both dangerous in different ways the reason why is because
SPEAKER_02: michael is astronomically uh complete when it comes to the press and also the kings i believe he's more joined up in the kings and i believe he's dogged in that respect but he doesn't have the same capability to create problems at the top of the match he doesn't have the same capability to hit the rise the same and i think that vitale may have fallen into
SPEAKER_02: A little trap where you pull Devon on the practice table and you think you've pulled Devon. And you've not. And Devon is one of the guys I would say is the least easy read on a practice table in the world. If not the worst. I don't think that he is dependent on what they did at the practice table. I think he's generally, Vitaly is knowledgeable enough to understand, watch his matches and everything. But I'm just saying that when...
SPEAKER_01: uh how to say when ermes got everything still it was very hard to pin michael what i'm just saying that yes even even you take everything from michael you it's still there is a challenge to finish him that that lasts us i think there also is for for dev mate and i think no no no no david david like he does that with a good good hand and wrist like if devon is like this like the sometime michael is put if if
SPEAKER_01: I know what you're saying, and I agree that that is a lane, but I don't know whether Vitaly will get there. Oh, no, that's another thing. No, no, I agree with that. But what I'm just saying is that that is what Vitaly does best. Yes, it is. He's got a good press. Once he takes the Devon's hand, I don't see resistance.
SPEAKER_01: But even if he takes the hand of Michael, like to finish it, there is always some resistance. Today we were talking about it, like except Andrei Pushkar, two rounds in their supermatch, you know, like this shape of Michael, like he doesn't get flash pinned. And that is what Vitaly does best. So people think that, you know, like, oh, like there will be no challenge. If somehow Vitaly is stopped by Michael,
SPEAKER_02: That is going to become a nightmare. That moment. I'm also going to say the same thing about Devon. Very, very few people flash pin him. Very, very few people. Unless he's damaged. So after the first round of the Saganashvili match, the first time he pulled LeBron, then he got pasted. But his bicep tendon had broken. Or his bicep itself had broken. It wasn't the tendon. It was the middle of the muscle. But...
SPEAKER_02: outside of that i don't believe he gets splashed much either very very very hard to very sticky so michael has less rise less pronation he doesn't pronate as naturally because of the lack of rise but he's got a much better and faster press and that's another big thing for for vitale to uh to be aware of because i actually think in a fatigued match
SPEAKER_02: that Michael would be unbelievably dangerous for Vitaly in that lane. I think from the setup, let's say for in the first round or first couple of rounds, he can't flash Mike. He can't get the access climb and he can't finish Mike quickly. I think that going forward from that point, it would really open up the press for Vitaly. And I think that,
SPEAKER_02: Michael is super dangerous there because Vitaly likes to pull off the counter quite a bit. And even his attack tends to be slightly B-side. So he won't go straight across the pronator. He rotates out. He sweeps out because of the length of the lever. That is unbelievably dangerous with Mike. Because when Mike comes in with that fast press, God, he's dangerous. Unbelievably dangerous. And I think it's the most direct press probably that I've ever felt.
SPEAKER_01: When he engages that, it's unbelievably devastating. Him and Jablonski are very direct presses. Yeah, but Michael's pressure is not constant, you know. He just goes, especially he does it either at the beginning of the match or...
SPEAKER_01: He tires you, tires you, tires you, tires you, and then if he takes you here, like if you are this side, and he just does. But Kamil can stay there forever, you know, and that is the only thing he is doing, you know, once he starts. What a match that is, incidentally. Kamil and Jerry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, my God. Did you know that Jerry lost his father? Oh, no. Yeah, and we can't really do
SPEAKER_02: Jerry doesn't feel good. I didn't know that, dude. I'm so sorry to hear that. That's terrible. I know I'm right in the middle of a similar thing there. That's not good at all. Wow. I need to send Jerry a message. I didn't know that. What a damn shame. Therrien. Anyway, so basically, you either finish Michael quick,
SPEAKER_01: which we see very seldom, or you need to have the tools to finish him. Like the way that Ermes pulled against Michael was the perfect execution of
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Hermes was great, wasn't he? It was fantastic. Very intelligent arm wrestler, I think, Hermes. I think he's a very smart guy, reads the sport very well. He's shown multiple examples of that throughout his career. And also, as I said when we were talking about the build-up,
SPEAKER_02: Hermes has great confidence when pulling Michael. And the thing is, I did an interview the day before, I think it was the day before, which I put out with Hermes, and we were talking about the accessibility with Mike.
SPEAKER_02: Because of the fact that Michael's not such a long arm, not such a giant guy in that respect, he feels the very best of Hermes. Because Hermes can really accelerate, can really rev up. So I do believe that the likes of Jerry, who's also not got a big long arm, and Mike, they feel Hermes at his absolute best. They really get a very severe test with Hermes.
SPEAKER_02: Special on Giants, that's a little more difficult for Hermes to get out of the blocks as cleanly and to get as much of his power down as he would with Mike. But it'll be very interesting to see Hermes get another crack at Levan and see what he's worked, what he's changed. Speaking to him the other day when we were in...
SPEAKER_02: When we were in Tbilisi, we spoke a lot about the improvements he's made to his rise, and it was very clear. I mean, you could see it. His rise was amazing. The improvements he's made to his cup, his pronator, a lot of things that he's improved were very evident.
SPEAKER_02: And I do feel like with that result against Mike going the way it did, that's probably going to have boosted his confidence a lot. You know, he'll probably feel very... It's nice to get a road test on some of this stuff. You know, you get a real road test. And I actually think Michael was in incredible shape. Yes, he was. I have never seen him like this before. Yeah, he was incredible, wasn't he? I don't know where his head was at, but that aside, the man was in unbelievable condition.
SPEAKER_02: And Michael is no joke, ever. So to perform like Hermes did there, I think it will have given his confidence a massive boost. Massive boost. So it'll be interesting to see how he does against Levan. But the other thing is, and I've said it many times, I keep coming back to it, I do think that Levan Saganashvili is very underrated for his arm wrestling and his read of the sport.
SPEAKER_02: don't know who's underestimating him but not a lot of people i get messages all the time talking about the power the strength the top end the physicality yeah sure that's all there i get it monster strong may be the pinnacle in that respect but what i do believe with with lebanon is that he's underrated in terms of his read of matches when you sit down and speak to the guy
SPEAKER_01: he can see the sport very clearly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a very smart guy. Therrien is a wrong perception that when they think that the guy is so huge, he's not smart. A lot of people that are super heavyweight are very, very smart guys, trust me. It has nothing to do with that. I actually think that's where, this is just my opinion, but I do think the sport has evolved there dramatically. People always talk about, you know,
SPEAKER_02: arm wrestling in the past to now i think that in the super heavyweight division particularly particularly in the supers there are better arm wrestlers than there's ever been arm wrestlers i don't mean top end strength i think that there's always been unbelievably strong guys
SPEAKER_02: Richard Lucas, Scott Norton, neither of whom were technically proficient arm wrestlers by comparison, both of whom were unbelievably strong. Cleve Dean, unbelievably strong, unbelievably difficult guy to deal with, but nowhere near as proficient an arm wrestler. So I think the big difference is that the top super heavyweights of today, number one, there's more of them.
SPEAKER_02: And number two, they are better arm wrestlers, more complete package arm wrestlers, probably than they've ever been. And I think that's the big thing. That's my honest opinion on it. I don't necessarily think that's the case lower down the weight classes. I think there were some very, very good arm wrestlers. It's all about the competition level, my friend. Yeah. Like, you know, in the West, there is a saying that, like, iron sharpens iron. Correct. Yeah. So, like...
SPEAKER_01: To have today's stage is worthless stage and having that competition and not to improve is impossible. Evgeny you lose at that stage, you improve for sure. You are learning. We discover the next level. We start with feeling.
SPEAKER_01: we will not understand you know we will not learn that that is we go there we feel it we experience and then we learn it that that is yeah look at pauline you know you you have been part of wal and you know paul from that time yeah would you ever think that pauline
SPEAKER_01: like in Rustam Bavev going like this. I would never, I would just say it will never happen. Not in the past, no. But Paul, the interesting thing is that when Paul pulled in the WAL, he was a relatively new athlete, new guy. Very green, very raw. Listen, if he was saying North America,
SPEAKER_02: he wouldn't have reached to the level that he reached today. Let's look at it another way, Engin, right? Yeah. I would like to think that as the sport grows more and gets greater notoriety,
SPEAKER_02: And more people come in. I mean, I go to train Brian Shaw this week and that'll get a great deal of eyeballs when Brian starts to compete more. I'm going to start working with Eddie Hall again in May. And as more people come through and more notoriety gets into the sport, I would like to think that others will come, you know? So America has a vast, not only America, there's a vast number of unbelievably strong people.
SPEAKER_02: not necessarily just super heavyweights or weight classes. And I would like to think that more will come. And as you say, the necessity to be that much stronger, to be that much better, the freedom of the availability of technical knowledge,
SPEAKER_02: much much more easily accessible than it's ever been these days i mean some great channels out there you only have to look at voice of arm wrestling another one daniel prokopchuk have you watched daniel's channel i think daniel does some awesome stuff really good technical tuition daniel prokopchuk's another one who's very very good and when people view this stuff more i i would hope that more and more
SPEAKER_02: talents emerge who in five years from now ten years from now may take that level further further you know might go somewhere else again and that's what's exciting it's the new guys that are coming in
SPEAKER_01: And where they can tell you something. I don't believe that. I don't believe that. And all the guys that are joining us, you know, at their 40, 45 will, will, uh, become like best or something, you know, in the guys who watch the teenagers of today, I would, I would, I would, I would just think that like, especially the ones that had a lot of other memory in their past, you understand?
SPEAKER_01: I think that they will have negative effect for their future. But if you are talking about the guys that now growing as a teenage, you understand? And then those people, yes, that we will have like very... At the beginning when I was organizing these events, when I organized so many matches, people were saying, Engin, we will be out of matches because you are organizing too many. That opportunity and that competition
SPEAKER_01: level is the one that is really making
SPEAKER_02: everything growing, growing and growing. That is what I believe right now. Evgeny coming up through the grassroots. So if you went to WAF, which, you know, the numbers are growing. Did you know this? Oh, mate, the level of WAF is phenomenal. And a lot of the guys that are flying under the radar, people may not think there are other amazing arm wrestlers out there. My God, there are.
SPEAKER_01: And more will come. More will come. I mean, what we have today at the West versus West is just a representation of WAF. Because 90, 95% of the athletes we have at the West versus West are the athletes that used to be at the WAF and the best. In the elite level, guys. Yes, yes, yes, yes. And they didn't become...
SPEAKER_01: good at the West versus West. They are getting better, but they already, that competition level, their national championships, European championships, Asia, world championships, every event, they are just going against each other, the Russian, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Latvia, Armenia, Turkey, things like that. It is just making them stronger and stronger. And another thing is, did you know that almost all of the national championships in every country,
SPEAKER_01: their numbers, some of them double, some of them five times compared to two years ago. Because the level is a lot of more interest. Because WAF is, to me, WAF is more important than West vs. West, my opinion. Because... Rough Roots is very important. Yeah, that is what I believe. Because how could West vs. West give
SPEAKER_01: all those thousands and thousands of 13 14 15 years old people an opportunity to compete against each other and get better and better and better what i am doing is i'm just picking those best guys and bringing here yes it's very very important but what i'm just saying that without wealth we wouldn't have levan we wouldn't have it's not it's not even just what yeah i agree 100 with what you're saying but it's also just the grassroots in
SPEAKER_02: in other areas. So the smaller events in Turkey, in the UK, in the USA, in Canada, in Bulgaria, all these events where people are coming to, you may feel like, oh, a lot of the promoters out there, they go unsung. They don't get a lot of notoriety and people don't talk about them. But without that underbelly, without that grassroots of how do I get into the sport? What do I do? What is my progression?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but my opinion is that if WAF is here, the things you are talking are here. Because WAF is the one that is giving this platform to them to compete against each other. Because just look at 30 years ago, majority of the best arm wrestlers were from North America. Majority. Like UConn championships was tougher than WAF. Yeah. Yeah. But today...
SPEAKER_01: They are behind because they stopped being part of that WAF competition. If now the American armwrestling again is growing, like getting tougher,
SPEAKER_02: It is because a lot of representatives also come in here and we are going there. I had a conversation like that this week with a couple of guys who messaged me about how do I get into this competition? How do I get into this competition? And I said, look, and how do I know I'm at that level? And I said, well, one very, very clear indication would be if you go to the WAF and you win,
SPEAKER_02: I promise you, you get noticed. If you go and you dominate at WAF and you're impressive at WAF... And then you will be invited. Yeah, well, yeah. That's all, yeah. That's all, yeah, you're right. If you're a North American athlete, if you're a UK athlete, if you're a Romanian athlete, Spanish athlete, I don't give a... Wherever you're from, you go to the WAF and you win, you will get spotted. End of.
SPEAKER_01: And trust me, I'm also watching the American Armistice. Therrien is one guy, Cody Wood. You know him? I know Cody. Yeah, yeah. That guy is also taking attention. Therrien are some other guys. I'm following. Let's talk about, while we talk about that, let's talk about the West versus West 17, Arlington. And...
SPEAKER_02: Arsen you ready to rock? I can't friggin' wait. Listen, I absolutely loved Sibley. I loved Sibley. It was ace. The crowd over there were phenomenal. Massive thank you, Georgi, because I felt awesome over there. The people in Georgi are the balls. It's like...
SPEAKER_02: It's like a cultural hub of strong bastards. Everybody's a fucking, I mean, you know, the taxi driver. You know this from 30 years ago. You know this from 30 years ago already. Like for 30 years, you know who these people are, you know? Monsters, mate.
SPEAKER_02: And the big thing there, we did the Florida event. Apart from the fact that I literally merely died of heat exhaustion, outside of that, unbelievable. Show was amazing. I love...
SPEAKER_02: the americans because i feel culturally at home over there they're all wild they know they know how to make noise yeah quality and it's like you know i can't i can't friggin wait i also the only mistake we made the only mistake we made was that to organize the event in august trust me when you're a fat guy in a three-piece suit that ain't good oh i nearly fucking died but
SPEAKER_02: Outside of that, I can't wait. I think Arlington's going to be amazing. I think there's some incredible matches on there. I mean, I like Hunter Knox as well. He's another rising star, and he's got a tough test for you. I didn't mention him because I already gave him a match, so it's obvious. He's on the radar, and I'm going slowly with him. And what do you think about...
SPEAKER_01: his match against Wallen Low. Do you know Wallen Low? Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, I think Wallen is a very good arm wrestler. Obviously, he's a proven entity. I think he's probably the best from that area of the world. I don't want to... Yeah, do you remember there was a China event? Therrien was a tournament some years ago, like four years ago or something, or five years ago. I don't remember exactly. And he took second to Mindaugas there. Yeah, well, mate, Wallen's really good. I think I always say that...
SPEAKER_02: If the levels are close and you're pulling the guy in... Let's say you're pulling an Englishman in England. I think the Englishman's probably got an advantage because all of the disparate elements that go to make it up, the fact that he's travelled less, he's very comfortable in his surroundings, in his environment. These are the things that matter a great deal. I do think Hunter is riding a rich man of form right now. I think...
SPEAKER_02: Hunter is a confident kid. I love that. Yeah, he is. I didn't know that he has some MMA base. MMA, multi-cross, I believe. Just a confident kid, naturally. And I think he's great. I was so impressed with him in Florida. First time I've met the guy in person. I was very impressed with his attitude. I was very impressed with the way he carried himself. I thought he was great. What's your prediction? I've got Hunter Knopf winning. I think it will be a tricky match.
SPEAKER_02: But I think that I actually think Hunter probably gets a blast pin early. I think then Valen starts to slow him down and test a few things. I think Valen is very brave and very technical. And I think he might make it difficult in the middle rounds. But I do think that Hunter is a very fit kid. And I think he probably outlasts him. Very good match. Valen first time out.
SPEAKER_02: That can make a difference. I think Valen's a real talent, and I think he's one of those guys that I believe will improve. I think every time Valen comes out there, and he's a very good arm wrestler. Therrien's a lot of matches for him. Regardless of the outcome here, and he might prove me wrong. This is a guess at the end of the day. The predictions are just a guess. I've got Hunter Knopf in a tight match. Let's go to the next one. Sarah Bäckman versus Jocelyne.
SPEAKER_02: Now, I know that last time out, Jocelyne beat Sarah. Yeah. I'm very interested to see how Sarah's taken that. Sometimes Sarah... My opinion is that... Without sounding dismissive, I think sometimes...
SPEAKER_02: the upper echelon girls need to have a very very clearly defined challenge because it's hard to get yourself that motivated and that ready when you've got very few challenges
SPEAKER_02: that you know of and that can breed a little bit of complacency and i wonder whether the first time they met jocelyn with her strength background was just much stronger than sarah anticipated and sarah can make some adjustments obviously jocelyn's a much bigger girl um i think this is a much more acid test and i don't know enough about um
SPEAKER_02: The strength differential. I know a lot of strong women. I'm training a few of them right now, and I think that the potential for that in the ladies side of the sport is probably even more than the men's personally in depth.
SPEAKER_02: And it's interesting to see whether Sarah can close some of that gap up, whether Sarah can come back in and have made a big difference. Now she knows what she's facing. She knows that this girl is no joke. Is she a much more motivated version, a stronger version? We'll find out. I think that, Neil, Sarah is professional enough to make
SPEAKER_01: difference from event to event i think you understand yes yes and i think very closely
SPEAKER_01: And Jocelyne, I think that she is not as experienced as Sarah, but because of being newer compared to Sarah, I think she is also making progresses. So what I see... I'm stronger. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think what I see that Jocelyne is getting stronger and stronger because more time and more time in arm wrestling, while Sarah knows...
SPEAKER_01: how to pick for more important, maybe she underestimated that event, because in North America, I mean, she was number one. Yes, not so many normal challenges. But now, it's almost like, fool me once, fool me twice. This is the real deal acid test now. Yeah, nothing to take away from Jocelyne. She won fair and square.
SPEAKER_01: And, but I'm not sure if she met the best of Sarah. So now there will be best of Sarah, but I don't think that Sarah will meet the same girl that she met last time either. I think now Jocelyne also getting stronger and stronger and
SPEAKER_01: So I think we will see very interesting match, very, very interesting match and very intense match. This is for the queen of North America. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Great. Who do you think is winning this one? I'm going to go with Sarah.
SPEAKER_02: And I'm going to go with Sarah based on experience. Obviously, as I say, I'm a purist. I believe that Sarah can make some technical adjustments. I don't know where Sarah's condition was. I think it's harder for people to close the gap quickly than to revisit. And I'm going to go Sarah. I'm very interested and I'm very excited to meet Jocelyne. I'm very excited to know more about her. I don't know a lot about her. I've seen her arm wrestle three times.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's go to another one. I just told you, gave the information about the new match we set. Yeah. I'm going to go with Shark. I do feel like he might be slightly stronger.
SPEAKER_02: i feel like he may not be quite as technical but i do feel like for both men because this is their first outing i think shark has a better opportunity to uh be a little bit more settled and a little bit more comfortable and shark is looking really solid the last time i've seen him when he comes in very ready which he will do for this obviously this is a big opportunity for him and i think he'll come out
SPEAKER_02: Very, very ready to do this thing. I think he's going to be tough to beat. He's a big lad at the weight. He's got good, big hands, pretty long levers, stays well. And he's been very impressive this last 18 months. He's got some wins in there that have really made me sort of sit up and watch him. And I think Shark's going to take the match. I understand. Yeah. Yeah. One second. One second.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and let's talk about something really, really big, very big. You can see that? People think that the size determines how big the things are. My wife knows. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Zenzu, one second. Hey Engin, any plans on having Ayana Takenaka pull at the West Versus again? She has been training very hard and gotten even stronger since last appearance. Yeah. My friend, I was going to set Ayana versus Dimitrina for a match, rematch, and if she would have won the WAF. And what WAF, I think she took third place in 55 kilo.
SPEAKER_01: So I will expect her to become best at WAF if she wants a rematch. Yeah. Anyway, so yeah, Minda Agos, Taras Haitis, Yannis Amouris. Very big.
SPEAKER_02: It's interesting because Roley Real Life Bins has just come into the chat. Roley, good evening, brother. Hope you're well, mate. He's just come back from a visit out to Mendoza Tarasaitis and I watched an interview on that the other day. And it's very interesting listening to Mendoza because Mendoza, as you know, is a very confident lad. And this is a match that I feel like, I mean, I've been trying to set it up for years. Giannis has always seemed like
SPEAKER_01: It was a match he didn't really want. I think Giannis is a guy that likes to be 100% ready. That's normal. Listen, when you're over 40 years old and you haven't... Matt, he was like that when he was 22. I don't know. I don't know. He was competing in every event when he was young, you know. I remember he was competing. Europeans, Wolves, Europeans, Wolves, sometimes even Zloty.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think that he was always 100%. But if you are putting someone like Mindaugas, you need to be 100%. Otherwise, the guy will... So let me put it a different way. I actually think that Giannis Amolins underrates himself sometimes. I think Giannis is better than he thinks he is. Yeah, I mean, I have no doubt. You will not believe me.
SPEAKER_01: I believe that Yannis is at his best right now. If he is not hurt, because I have been following him, gym trainings and everything, and his size, normally he couldn't gain weight. Now he's almost 80 kilos. And yeah, I think that Yannis is in incredible shape. But now the challenge is also very big. Minerva Sarasay is a very dangerous guy. You would see him on the street, you would just bet
SPEAKER_02: your life that you would beat this guy but but yeah when you feel him it's not the same thing unless your name is england so then then it's okay easy you know yeah but i mean you see you see this guy you walk into a bar you look down the end of the bar and you see a slim built guy and you know like a weird jumper like a big some kind of beige or like forest green type thing maybe with a pattern on and you think to yourself look is this guy wearing
SPEAKER_02: You don't realize that that's the greatest arm wrestler of all time. You don't realize you look down there and you also don't realize that he is a bastard, an absolute like you've never met, like you could go over and be nice to him. You might buy him a drink. And he'll say.
SPEAKER_02: That's the wrong drink. This is a guy that's just a natural bastard whilst being the greatest arm wrestler ever to draw breath. And having bad dress sense. That's a weird combination. You know, it's a weird combination. Which one is it? Danny Tesh or Minda Agos is greater? Oh, wait a minute. Danny Tesh is not an arm wrestler. Devon't make that mistake. Let's make a distinction here. Okay. Danny Tesh is omnipotent.
SPEAKER_02: Danny Tesh doesn't exist. He's a different thing, mate. He's everywhere. Okay. Okay. Apples and oranges. Apples and oranges. Different guy. Different thing. Okay. Danny Tesh, number one, he can twat your dad. Says it all. Now, let's get back to Mendes Tarasaitis. You were right to say this is a dangerous match for Giannis because they see each other very, very regularly. Very regularly.
SPEAKER_02: And Mindaugas would never let this die. He would never let it drop. But can you imagine the pressure for Mindaugas if he was to lose this match? Because you know he ain't getting a rematch. That is not happening. If Giannis beats his ass here, he'll never pull him again. But the same for the opposite way as well. No, I think I actually don't...
SPEAKER_01: I don't agree. I think Mindaugas is pulling him again. Listen, Mindaugas is our contract drafted. Why would I set the same match again if Mindaugas beats Giannis? Well, I love this match. I'd watch it three times over. No, but I'm just saying that if Giannis is beating Mindaugas, there is no rematch. And if Mindaugas is beating Giannis, there is no rematch either. I'd put it on. See, you're killing the fun there, Engin. What if it's a great match? It's an amazing match.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think people would want to see this three, four times over. I'd like to see Justin Bishop and Giannis again. I'd like to see Justin Bishop and Mendergas again. I think they're great matches. I absolutely loved that match. I thought that match with Giannis and Justin was awesome. My favorite match that day. I thought it was a great match. And for me, when a match is really good and it's so clear that it could be
SPEAKER_01: know you run it on tuesday you get one result you run it on thursday it's a different result yeah yeah not for the at the east first stage because i mean we need to do rematches when they are like really i don't know like really yeah yeah yeah i mean that match was hot but usually i would try like i would do either versus
SPEAKER_02: Samusha rematch. That deserves to have... I mean, Samusha almost beat him. He was like 4-3, and he was very, very close. Very, very close. I love this match. It's a dangerous match for David, without doubt. Dangerous match for David. But this match is as close to 50-50 as you're going to get. We are talking super competitive match. I actually agree with what you said a moment ago. I think Giannis, when he's on at the moment,
SPEAKER_02: is as good as he's ever been. I think Giannis underrates himself. And I think that it's quite an interesting thing that he believes right now that he can win. Because if he didn't, he wouldn't have accepted this match. And it's whether... I told him, first I told him, how is your shape? He said, pretty good. Today I did this much of weight and things like that. And I said, Giannis, you know that you are not getting any younger, you know?
SPEAKER_01: And I think it's time. You are in good shape. You don't have so much pain. I know the opponent is dangerous, but you are also dangerous. And this match needs to happen. And he accepted. And we will see. I think it will be a great one. So who's winning? You said 50-50? Yeah, I've got... Right now, I see the match as a slight edge to Mindaugas. But we're talking 45-55. This is close. Real close. And it's my favourite match on the card.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, just say that right now I'm 92 kilos. I just checked my weight this morning or yesterday morning. And then I made 85 kilos. This is very, very hard for me in a short time to lose more weight because I'm lazy and all the metabolism is slow. But just tell me honestly. But because when that day comes, you know, I will want you to do this. And then I'm ready. Like the same shape that I pulled with Vior Aldobrin.
SPEAKER_02: And then I'm pulling Minde. Where are you putting your money? I'm going to say Minde again. Devon't talk to me about this if, buts and maybe stuff, right? Because what we need to do is, that match has got to happen, Inge. No, no, no, no. That's not what I am asking. No, no, seriously. It's got to happen. Let's go. Tell me where is your money. Tell me that one.
SPEAKER_02: I know you want Mindaugas to win, but... I don't give a shit who wins. You do, you do. I don't care. You would want that. Listen, if you want to know what I love about this match, it's this. Whoever wins...
SPEAKER_01: About what? About which match? You and Mindingus. It is nothing like whoever or something. I'm winning that, you know. I don't even... Listen, I can bounce ball. I can bounce ball under the table and I will still top roll that guy, okay? I would bounce. I would be drinking coffee. I would be sleeping. I would still top roll him.
SPEAKER_01: let's do it let's go i will i will i will just like you if you have a motivation can you imagine how much ammunition i've got on the dude when he is if if i wanted to come back to arm wrestling just no no disrespect mindago is for sure one of my favorite arm wrestlers
SPEAKER_01: But if I'm coming back, I'm not coming back and paying all the price because of beating Mindaugas. I'm going to pull him. I would pull him. But just don't think that, you know, I'm coming back for him. That would be the... Come back, listen. Come back, crack Samusha. All right? Because that's the match you want. Listen, Samusha, different story. I would bet my life on, we hold with Samusha, I would take his wrist.
SPEAKER_01: if you tell me would you bet your life that you can pin him four times no i wouldn't bet even my finger on it because there's something different challenge you know yeah yeah so much is really strong i mean can you imagine the pressure that will be on you as you approach a match with menegas
SPEAKER_01: Oh, my God. The pressure. Therrien's a chance. Therrien is no pressure. I would beat the shit out of him. That's why we've got to do it. Yeah. But listen, I need to burn that fat. You understand? And start training and heal up. And every time I go start. And then listen, we have a saying in my country. You can't carry two watermelon under one arm.
SPEAKER_01: that east versus west organizing and this why do why do you think why we'll do it in arm wars do you think listen listen this is like it's very hard for you you understand it is not about that right now like after robert getting mold with both king of table east versus west now i'm not organizing like event every three months now we are doing every one and a
SPEAKER_01: So it is kind of, I thought it would be easier, but I don't think it is easier. You understand? It is maybe even harder. You understand? Yeah. A lot of things get easier, like especially the business part, but about the matchmaking and other things, you know, it just, and like,
SPEAKER_01: podcasts today i had podcasts told them like you and before you reach ali and tomorrow another one another one everything yeah so i mean i will try i can't promise but listen i'm gonna lose weight and smack the piss out of mindagus myself you will yeah that's what's gonna happen i mean i guess if you're watching you mother you
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, when we pulled the super matches, I beat him 10-0, 5-5. He told me that he was going to tire me and he was going to hold me from my forearm and beat me. He did that to me. Yeah, yeah, it's okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And listen, and I...
SPEAKER_01: He just talked a lot before the match. Talk, talk. Maybe a lot of new fans don't know that time. I beat him in 2019. And we both were like under 75 kilos. And he talked a lot. And after the match, first thing he said, if we ever pull again, I'm not going to talk this much. Therrien's no way I could make 75. I mean, I can't make with that. Unless I got like some serious illness, I can't make 75 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, you don't have to. You don't have to. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so let's focus. I love, listen, there is nobody... Listen, if I pull him, I will pull him at the King of the Table.
SPEAKER_01: And listen, and... You can't pull him at the King of the Table. Devon't be silly. You can pull him at the King of the Table. You're too involved in King of the Table. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. What should I do? Should I not arm wrestle? What is that? Dave you never arm wrestled at the Arm Wars? No, you come back, you get into amazing shape. You have never arm wrestled at the Arm Wars? Yeah. You did, right? Of course I have. Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: But I had like, I think we had, how many matches did we have that day? 25 matches. It's okay. That's good. That's good. Yeah. It doesn't have to be 25 matches, but yeah. So let's talk about, let's talk about, listen, there is nobody that I love to tease as much as like Minda, Minda. Before we move on from this, I know you're an organizer, but that, this is Minda. Who have you got? Giannis or Minda? Who have you got? Come on. Oh,
SPEAKER_01: Listen, it can go either side. I'm 100% honest. I'm telling you, Giannis wouldn't take this match if he didn't believe that he can win. I agree. Yeah. So if Giannis believes, this is different than what other people believe. You understand? If Giannis... Listen, there are some people they know. Some people are delusional. Some people...
SPEAKER_01: I'm not delusional. Like you said, I said my opinion. You said, I said something else. You understand? Because I know my capabilities and everything. It doesn't mean I cannot beat him, but this is very little chance I'm talking about Samusha. But when we believe in something, when we believe in something, we talk, that is different. If Devon is talking about something, he knows what he's talking about. If John is talking about something, he knows what he's... If I am talking about...
SPEAKER_01: Janis is talking about, we know what we are talking about. So Janis Amolins, if he took this match, it means that he believes in himself. Yes, I think so. At least 50% of winning chance. So he knows himself. So if he believes that, I cannot know his shape better than he does. So it means that Janis Amolins, in his very good shape, does he have a chance to beat Mindaugas? Yes, he has a chance to beat Mindaugas.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's mean that was a chance to beat Janis. Yeah, they bought it. So I will just like not nothing. I'm not being political or anything like this is 5050 match. Right. And where's the microphone? Microphone? Yeah. Where is it? Which microphone? Yours? On my phone. Okay, so lean in real close. Devon't worry. Everybody hates me because they won't care.
SPEAKER_01: Just lean in and be like, Janis is going to fucking kill him. You said 55-45 mindagas. I did, yeah, but that doesn't mean you have to. No, no, no. I'm 100% saying, listen, if I would believe that, listen, if I would believe one of them has more chance than the other one, I wouldn't say anything about the percentage. If I'm saying 50-50, it means that I can say it because it is 50-50.
SPEAKER_01: If I'm not saying 50-50 about their match, it means that I believe in something else. So here's my dynamic on this, right? The biggest thing is going to be pressure. Okay, let's go. Matt Mask versus Ongar Webb. Oh, you killed me. I was just getting into it. What the f*** are you on? Yeah, and what do you think about Matt Mask's shape in Atlantic City?
SPEAKER_02: mate i i absolutely love it when matt mask is on fire and when we were out in atlantic city i actually thought he it was easy for him i thought he looked very very confident and it looked very very very calm i think that matt has a mega chance here and let me say why because
SPEAKER_02: incredibly difficult to stop he's got great access to a lot of lanes that can create problems for a counter top roller particularly if that guy's driven out of the lane and the biggest thing and i mean this take this as it's meant on the bias is an arm wrestler
SPEAKER_02: He's a guy that utilizes technical prowess. I think that's his biggest weapon. Do you believe that he can be at his best after the surgery? This is his first match? No, I don't. I don't think so. And that's why I think that it favors Matt. Let's say this match had happened when he hasn't had surgery and he's back and I've seen him
SPEAKER_02: pulling at his absolute peak i think i think maybe i'd even favor hunger by it slightly very slightly because he does have the ability to utilize a lot more side cleanly with a strap if he holds on to his pronator that is a weakness for matt matt gains a great deal in height is unbelievably explosive
SPEAKER_02: And in my opinion, has the capability to beat Kydyrgali. Whether he'll utilise it. I think Matt's best route to beating Kydyrgali is actually knuckles up. And he doesn't like to do that. He'll often come off his wrist. He'll reverse off his wrist. I think that's a slight mistake. If I was working in Matt's corner for this, I'd keep my knuckles high.
SPEAKER_02: Because I think that makes him more inaccessible. But that's for those guys to figure out. I think that gives Matt a much more dominant position. I'm a little concerned whether Kydyrgali comes into this slightly rusty. That's my honest opinion. Will he come in slightly rusty? Where's he at? I haven't seen him compete. We know he's had the surgery. I believe the guy's an arm wrestler.
SPEAKER_02: at his core, I think he wins by exceptional arm wrestling. He's not a guy that if you picture, as I say, the boxer or the puncher, Kierna Galli is the boxer. He's not the guy that's coming in there to rely on unbelievable power. He's going to out arm wrestle you. And that's what he's basing his whole approach on. And that's why I think Matt's got a great opportunity here to really, really excite the crowd.
SPEAKER_02: Both these two guys are two of my favorite arm wrestlers for very different reasons. Matt, I always kind of want Matt to do well because he's such an exciting arm wrestler. How can you not be a Matt Mask fan? Is there one? Is there anybody who's not a Matt Mask fan? I mean, Matt Mask is a frigging amazing, entertaining arm wrestler. When Matt comes out and he gets really revved up,
SPEAKER_02: is so exciting and the whole crowd ignites and i actually hope that kira galley's pride which he's got a lot of and his innate ability turns this into an absolute battle because if it does i think we'll get an incredible match and i think we'll see the very best of matt mask the very best of matt mask who's winning
SPEAKER_02: I've got it 55-45 in favor of Mask.
SPEAKER_02: 55-45 in favour of Mask. Super close match. Matt needs to be very, very careful of reversing off this guy. Kira Galli's an exceptional puller and he finds lanes through people. Matt does have a weakness on the B side and he does have a weakness when he can't get accelerated if he gets the brakes put on early. And there's enough back pressure here and enough danger in the pronator for Kira Galli to take away a lot of that booming hit.
SPEAKER_01: And I think that's something he needs to be very mindful of. But if Matt is mindful of it, and he comes in with a solid game plan, I think he's a slight favourite. Okay. Yeah, okay. Ahmed Burak Atin says, being away, I'm messing with my demons in life. And it looks like I have missed a lot. When will be the next event hosted in Istanbul? We don't know that, Ahmed Burak. Is the May event there, mate?
SPEAKER_01: What do you mean? May have been in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan. Ooh, that'll be good. Yeah, that is another den of lying. Oh, mate, what? Yeah, but the bad part is that it is right, like, around the time of Kazakhstan Nationals. And, yeah, so it is like we won't be… Is the Kazakhstan Nationals that weak?
SPEAKER_01: like within a week i think 17 17 or like i don't exactly remember but yeah okay prudnik versus cody marriage left arm oh that's interesting
SPEAKER_01: If Prudnik was at his best, you understand, that would be problematic. But lately, I don't know where he is at right now. And I know Cody is very deadly. But I think that to beat Prudnik, to beat him, he needs to really hook him somewhere near center and stop him, beat him. But can he do that? Because...
SPEAKER_01: like for his his category and his weight how heavy is yevgeny hanging right now he said like 100 110 kilo he said or 12 kilo something like that so he's not quite super prudnik but he's getting big yeah i mean yeah he's he could make 105 kilo and he could make 15 he could make like i don't know yeah so he's not at his biggest
SPEAKER_02: Okay, who's winning? Emir? Emir? I'm going to go with Merritt as a slight favourite. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: 55-45, Cody Merritt. Close match. Okay. And let's go to the next one. I'm sure you will like this one. That's an underrated match, Engin. Yeah. No, no. It's an incredible match. I know. Yeah. And John Kering versus Craig Tullier. Oh. Let me tell you. I am so pumped for this match.
SPEAKER_02: This is my second favourite match on the card for a lot of reasons. And my first one is which one? My favourite match on the card is Mindaugas and Giannis. This is my second favourite match on the card for a lot of reasons. Love both these lads. Two very good friends, personal friends.
SPEAKER_02: guys at different ends of the spectrum craig is our era old school mega puller acid tested always finds a way rigid strong super experienced being there worn out the t-shirt terrian is right now
SPEAKER_02: It is his time. He wants to prove it. He's spitting venom. He really is lighting people up. He is on a tear. The Savage. Both these guys are aggressive pullers.
SPEAKER_02: this is going to be a friggin hellfire match okay if you're saying that it is going to be a long match i think that's what you mean i think this is going to be a cracking match both these guys are more versatile than people think the interesting thing with this is both guys can finish matches quickly and will finish matches quickly they've both got unbelievable hits two yay two hits this guy can hit
SPEAKER_02: then recoil and come at you again. Trust me, I've been there. Very, very difficult to hang on to. His opponent can do the same. Both these guys have got really solid, well-rounded capability. Both can pull a hard top roll. Both these guys can also transition very well into a fierce dragging hook. This is a great match. Super underrated match. On experience, I give the advantage to Craig.
SPEAKER_02: And you look at that and you think, oh, he comes out a slight favourite. 55-45 favourite. On desire, I actually give the advantage to Therrien. On confidence, I would give the advantage to Therrien. I think John will come in here a little bit with that Hunter Knopf's kind of balls-to-the-wall attitude. He's nothing to lose. He's pulling an absolute frigging American legend.
SPEAKER_02: You know, so this is such an intriguing match. As close as it gets, I'll go marginal favorite. Craig Touye, marginal, marginal favorite. And it is frigging marginal. And I would not be at all surprised to see John Terry and get this result. Love the match. Absolutely love that match. Can't wait. Can't wait. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Dave Chaffee versus Georgi Westbrook. Jesus. So where did I see the other day? I was watching something. I wasn't watching. I was listening it in the car. And it had Dave on. And I can't even remember. Maybe my podcast? I think it was your podcast. I think it was your podcast. And I had it on in the car.
SPEAKER_02: And he said that he was feeling good, was back, wasn't having the same pain, wasn't having the same issues. That was very encouraging because the guy that he's arm wrestling against is probably...
SPEAKER_02: arguably the the best top roller pure top roller yeah he's phenomenal at finding that position and he's much better than people think extremely underrated however he's also got great stamina but if he does have a failing it's that he will not really change his style
SPEAKER_02: And we know that Dave has got the ability to press hard. And he's very clunky. Dave is a little bit like Richard Lutkus. He's that kind of style where he's not really, and I mean this respectfully, he's not really attractive looking. He's no Curio Galeon Gavioth. But nevertheless, he's incredibly effective. And I feel like
SPEAKER_02: That is quite unique for Tsvetkov also, because he's going to feel a different approach here. He's not going to feel that smooth hand. He's not going to feel the nice, clean lines that he gets from most guys that he top rolls. And I'm actually interested to see how he deals with that. Does he have the same access to his top roll that he gets when he's pulling an orthodox or a more orthodox puller?
SPEAKER_02: Also, can he get such a controlling position on Dave that he can deny him that press? I believe he's got better stamina than Dave, but I believe Dave's more well-rounded. And if Dave is back to his best, that is a very, very, very interesting match. However, he will need to be back to his best because if he's not, he'll get run over.
SPEAKER_02: Because this is a very, this is an acid test. This is a step up from the last match we saw. You know, everybody was celebrating the last match we watched with Dave. I get it. And that's great. And Dave is elite level. And if Dave comes in fit, he's a match for anybody. Yeah, I agree. But he's going to need to be. Dave has probably the strongest side pressure when he's healthy. Mega.
SPEAKER_02: Yes. Anyway, so let's go. Devon versus Corey. I've got Devon on endurance. I think this is three round match, five round. What do you rate? West of five. West of five. Yeah, I've got Devon. I think
SPEAKER_02: that the the difference maker here will be the endurance i think that devon's pronation is a problem his height is a problem i think that west is super dangerous early and he's in my opinion stronger i don't think he has the same endurance i think he's got more top end
SPEAKER_02: I'm also interested to see where Devon's at. Does Devon, has he lost weight? I need to sort of speak to Devon properly. Is he genuinely... You know, we spoke the other day, and at the moment he was saying that he didn't want to pull against Lalletin. He didn't want to pull him in May, but he wants to pull him in August, yeah. But...
SPEAKER_02: i know from speaking to devon previously that he did want that match he loved that match so the fact that he doesn't want to pull him in may gives me some insight on where he's at or i assume it gives me some insight on where he's at and that may mean that he's stepping down a little bit he's chilling out a little bit he's a little bit less focused
SPEAKER_02: His left arm is healthier than his right arm a lot of the time, but it's nowhere near as complete. It's nowhere near as strong. It is tricky. It is quicker. And that makes it an interesting match. And I think his endurance is very, very, very, very good.
SPEAKER_02: I believe that will probably win him the match, but I believe that Corey has the lane to blast him early. If I was in Corey's camp, I'd be thinking, that's my lane. I've got to put this dude away. I've got to put him away early. I think if Devon gets the brakes on at any point, from that point on, he's going to struggle. So I've got Devon probably 60-40 Devon.
SPEAKER_02: Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. People, people, people think that, you know, it will be an easy match. It will not be, especially. No, no. My God, no. Therrien is a possibility here that Corey West comes in and literally blasts him, just lights him up and it's done. He just blasts him. It could happen. I don't think it will happen, but it could. Devon't be surprised. I mean, my God, you know, when we did the last podcast and, uh,
SPEAKER_02: I was quite proud, actually. I didn't get some matches on that card right, but I got this one right. I said, look, I think Morozov and Leleitin will be a much tougher match than people think. And so it turned out to be. And whenever we do these predictions, you're trying to visualise the match, you're trying to see it, but it's a guess, ultimately.
SPEAKER_02: Therrien's a lot of nuance goes on in this stuff. And when you get two guys that are extremely high level, I mean, that's why you've put this much together for Christ's sake. Therrien are lanes. Therrien are opportunities for these guys to win. Corey West is very big, very powerful.
SPEAKER_02: if he can explode and keep control he has the opportunity to win but i think he's going to be brave and i think he's going to do things slightly different to get a result on dev if he takes the usual lane i think that he's going to get stopped at some point and that will be a problem yeah okay john birthing versus yoshinobu kanai well my god what a what a nostalgic mega match
SPEAKER_02: Fucking hell. Love it. Two of my favorite arm wrestlers of all time. End of. Love them. These guys are my era. These guys are my friends. These guys are exceptional. And they are characters. One of them is the best arm wrestler of all time.
SPEAKER_02: The other one is one of the best warriors of all time. I mean, the warlord for a reason. This guy's called the warlord because that is what he does. I have seen Yoshinobu Kanai so many times do things he has no right to do.
SPEAKER_02: I have seen John Brzenk more times do things he has no right to do. What an unbelievably entertaining match. I actually think that Yoshi Kanai probably wants this more than John. This guy has pursued John Brzenk for years. He's been trying to beat John for years. He had him over to Japan multiple times to pull him there. Never managed to get him.
SPEAKER_01: i think yoshi will be true last time they they met with john yeah the last time out yeah last time what was john's age i mean younger than now do you know the age or no i think it was about 54 maybe
SPEAKER_02: So let's be honest, John definitely is deteriorating in terms of his residual injuries and in terms of his desire. Does Yoshi have a better shot? Definitely.
SPEAKER_02: Endurance gives him a great opportunity. The danger point with John always is, number one, if he comes in ready, if he comes in focused, he's lethal. And where? The hand. I don't think we can draw too many conclusions off what we saw with Todd. Because Todd Hutchins and Yoshi is always going to be a great match because they pull so similar. John has the ability to shut the game down.
SPEAKER_01: to take away Yoshi's ace. You know, John doesn't like the guys with, like, especially now. In the past, he didn't matter. But now, with the tall forearms and, you know, real high reach, Yoshi is, like, not so tall. Not a big man. Yeah, yeah, not a big man. And his hand is not big either. John will have a good grip. You know, there is a possibility John to have a little bit control and come here. Yes. And if he comes here, his chance of finishing Kanai...
SPEAKER_01: quicker than Todd is higher. But he may never able to finish either. But his chances to finish it quicker is higher because he has this. And every time I see John finishing, Kanai, maybe I shouldn't say every time, majority of the times, he finishes this way. And Kanai is here, halfway down is here, good. He is not possible to beat with more pulling because he pulls better, but he is kind of vulnerable.
SPEAKER_02: I agree. And this is the biggest danger for Yoshi. For everyone, John's hand is the problem. John's hand is the issue. Much more than his arm. His hand is incredible. His wrist is incredible. And he's also got experience with this guy. Extensive experience. That is the problem for Yoshi because he knows lanes. But both of them have good experience about each other.
SPEAKER_01: Great match though, my God, love it. Listen, people don't realise, I don't know how much they appreciate, but we are very, very lucky to still be able to see this guy at the table. When we are talking about greatest arm-master of all time, we are not bullshitting, we are not giving favour. I tell this all the time, people will think that you're repeating.
SPEAKER_01: But when this guy in his prime, when he was at the stage, we all felt like we saw an alien or something. Every time he's on the stage, we will look at him like it's something different creature.
SPEAKER_02: Not a human being, but something from another planet. They don't understand. Started his career, 85 kilo class, worked his way up, beat the piss out of everything that draw breath. Therrien's very few people that have ever been able to do a great deal with him. And when he was at his best, his fluidity was beautiful to watch. That is why you listen.
SPEAKER_01: I say that you can't imagine something that you haven't seen. You understand? Like, I can't imagine arm wrestling being performed better than this guy. That's why I said in the past, bird flies, fish swims, jumpers in arm wrestles, you know? That's what you meant, right? When you say fluently, you know? Yeah. He's a perfect storm. And there will be a time.
SPEAKER_01: unfortunately we will not see this guy anymore you understand so we are very very lucky it doesn't matter if he is now 60 61 we are very very lucky that we still see him at the table and i hope people understand this and they appreciate because there will be a time that we will not see him again at the table at least you know what was interesting and give florida
SPEAKER_02: He really enjoyed that. Therrien was times in that match where John probably felt like he should give up. He was in terrible position, but he really enjoyed it. You could see the old John trying to, you know, yeah, he wasn't fluid anymore. He's an old man, but he was enjoying himself. And that was great. It was nice to see. I went with, there was an Applejack, is it called? Or Applebiz or whatever it's called down the road. And we went for some of the weeks in there with Bob and Todd.
SPEAKER_02: and talking to him there. And he said, yeah, I really bloody enjoyed that, Neil. That was fun. And that's what it's about. It's a reason. It's why. And for me, for John now, yeah, pull back. You don't have to pull. I don't think he needs to pull top dudes. Matches like this where there's some intrigue there and it's a fun match. And yeah, that's what it's about, you know? That's what it's about. Veterans League. And can you believe that even when he loses,
SPEAKER_01: the crowd shows incredible respect to the guy. And the way that he was saluted by the spectators in Orlando after he won, it was incredible. So I'm just saying that
SPEAKER_02: People can agree, disagree, I respect, but we are very lucky to see this guy still competing and I really enjoy it. The amount of respect he commands me is ridiculous. Let's say, I mean, it's hard to put it in perspective, but... When I was a young guy, it would have been like...
SPEAKER_02: the absolute talisman to get a win on John, right? Because he's the best and you always wanted to pull him. But the weird thing is that if I'd ever beaten him, I'd have felt bad. Because he's also your hero. He's also the guy. So it's a weird thing. And you still see that sort of reverence now. You still see guys...
SPEAKER_01: And if you beat him now, you haven't beat him. He's 61. I pulled John when John was in his prime. Neil, just go and ask all those people who were an armwrestler at his time. Oh, my God. Just tell me that one guy doesn't list him as his favorite armwrestler.
SPEAKER_01: Just ask Matyushenko, go ask Denis Siplenko, go ask Alexey Voivoda. I wish he was still alive. We would ask Andrei Pushkar. Just show me one guy that doesn't respect him. And just show me one guy that he wouldn't say that he's inspired by him. Like when I was young, when I was young, like, like Gary Goodrich versus John Brzenk, like Yukon Jack, 94.
SPEAKER_01: The match that, the long tough match that Gary beat him, I mean, I watched that match like 5,000 times. And then what John, how John inspired me was that he was so brave. Like I'm someone like who is not like genetically gifted, nowhere near to John. And so I had to, you know what I'm talking about. I had to pull in a very perfect way.
SPEAKER_01: You understand? I, even though I want walls in the hook or something, but I couldn't be as relaxed as John and just go there. Yeah. So, but, but whenever I see him, you know, the, how he helped me was that he made me braver. I was like, he inspired me, you understand? So whenever he going there, so he kind of helped me to be braver, to try like,
SPEAKER_01: more dangerous positions at least in the training and then i use them not by preferring at the world level but whenever i need it i still use it as a necessity yeah yeah yeah necessity i use it yeah but i i built that because of being inspired by him to pull in all kind of ways and yeah like i mean i can't i mean just people things like maybe difference about when i'm talking about highly about him
SPEAKER_02: But anyone who witnessed his career in his prime, just tell me, find me one person. I'm going to say this, right? He doesn't agree with me. I would love to see a prime John just picked up out of time and thrown in the mix now in the 95s, 105s, 115s. Yeah. I know where my money is, and I know where my money is.
SPEAKER_01: with I'll bet high. I'm like, I'm just saying, look, I respect everybody, but I'm telling you, I'm my opinion. John would be the pace out of 99% of that field. Yeah. Just can you imagine a 90 kilo guy today is just doing something in super weight category. No way. No, no. Yeah. And listen, listen, when John was winning in his category,
SPEAKER_01: the thing is that it was only formality you know that it was not it was not like nobody was excited everyone was waiting because when he competed all those events he was competing in american events all those categories his weight and the above categories in petaluma in tahoe and everywhere everywhere so we we didn't even doubt you know about his superior weight win but maybe we were hoping that somebody would give him some tough match but his category whenever he's winning
SPEAKER_01: Evgeny at the Zloty Tour, Nemirov, his category, can you imagine that with left arm he was winning Zloty while people were trying to make top three at the Zloty Tour? He was winning with left arm. I don't know if he was even training with left arm. Never really worked on it. Just mucked about on it. But yeah, John of this peak, complete weirdo. We talked about it earlier, the evolution of the
SPEAKER_02: know the evolution of super heavyweights i i don't personally believe that john at any time uh would have been able to come in and dominate someone like lavar i don't no no no no i think levon would beat him anyone everyone yeah he's too big and he's too but but we're not talking about we're talking about a guy that was an 85 kilo and 90 kilo arm wrestler that's what we're talking about i mean
SPEAKER_02: I mean, look, I think Devon has always been a problem for John and always would be a problem for John. But Devon is a giant. John isn't.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I will tell you something, the best of John, in my opinion, in a tournament style would be Devon. But whenever you talk about the Supermatch format, then the things are different. But if they are both just say like 105 kilo, I would still bet on John, even in Supermatch. You've got to take away some of Devon's teeth.
SPEAKER_02: to make that a better match because Devon is a giant. So Devon's trying to do what John did the other way. He's trying to go down in classes when John was coming up in classes. Now, both you can do, but do I believe that it depletes Devon? Yes, I do. I think that when you see Devon lighter, he's depleted. He's not as strong. He's not as dangerous. When he's bigger, everybody's not there. Listen, Devon, as big as he is,
SPEAKER_01: My opinion, in a supermatch format, he would beat John. Yeah, he's too big. But if Dave would be 105 kilos as he did against Petrenko, no doubt I would... I'll tell you what. Anyway, so... I'd love to see... I'd love to see a peak John, absolute prime John, just have a go at Levan. I'm not saying he could win. I don't think he could.
SPEAKER_01: But I'd love to see him have a go. I would. I'd love to see him just try and see what he could do. I'd love to see a prime John against any of them. Neil, there is one guy. His name is Leo Messi, an idiot. He says John is overrated. No, he's not.
SPEAKER_02: No, no. These guys just go to probably their grandma's, you know, basement and then write on the keyboard, you know, the things that they have never seen. John is not overrated. John is rated correctly and universally respected for a reason.
SPEAKER_01: john yeah john is mega if you go and speak to lavon saganeshvili he will tell you john's the guy if you go to devon lara he'll tell you john's the guy you know what would be do you know what would be it's fair time he'll tell you john's the guy you know what would be a good match i think that air mess versus best of john but of course that airman would be 25 kilo heavier like one is 131 is 105. at their best it would be a very good match i absolutely think john wins that match
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, possible. No, no, don't say that this idiot would be offended, Leo Messi. Anyways, Neil, thank you very, very much. We are here for one hour and 40 minutes. I think I'm going to watch Real Madrid versus Atletico Madrid or something maybe I was talking about. Yeah, normally I stop watching football, but because...
SPEAKER_02: He wants to watch it, so I just want to spend time with him. Yeah, mega. I'm excited. I go out to Colorado this week to work with Brian Shaw. I'm going to try my very best to help Brian get to build on the stuff Devon did with him and the other guys that have been working with him.
SPEAKER_02: try and build up his uh his technical arsenal and make him better and better and hopefully he's back in the mix soon we know that eddie hall's coming back to arm wrestling after he's had his fights exciting times and then straight off the back of that a couple of weeks and then we're over in arlington and i can't wait it's going to be mega could be awesome i wish you i wish you the best my friend and keep in touch you take care thanks mate take it easy thanks everybody in the chat hope you and your families are well and uh see you again
