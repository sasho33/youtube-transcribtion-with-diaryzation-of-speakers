SPEAKER_00: This is the second podcast today, back to back. And now we have West versus West super heavyweight world champion, Levan Saginacili. How are you Levan? Wood, normal. Normal. Wood, good, good. I'm also good. Yeah. And let me quickly, Levan, share this link. It will take only maximum
SPEAKER_00: one minute, not even one minute. Okay, yeah, and let me go on the... Levan, when I talk, I think the voice is coming from there as well. Is it possible to stop it? I hear my voice back from you, but is there any way to
SPEAKER_00: Um, okay. Now, now it doesn't do that anymore. Yeah. Before I was talking and I was hearing back. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Only, only Instagram left and I'm sharing Instagram as well. And then let's start, uh, when I came to, when I came to, um, Tbilisi and I saw that you were already in a great shape.
SPEAKER_00: And so probably it was because of the reason that there was a possibility to pull Laletin in May. And because Hermes didn't want to pull as the first match. Okay, I'm done. I'm starting. Yeah. And so was that the reason that you started training early?
SPEAKER_00: Did you understand? Okay, okay. So when I come to Tbilisi, early, early February, you were already in very good shape. You had arms big. I saw you, you were just like, I mean, really big and great shape. And was the reason that you were already in a very good shape, was the reason because
SPEAKER_00: there was a possibility to pull Laletin in May, so maybe you started to train earlier? Yeah, because we talked about this before. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Yeah, I think there is a small maybe connection problem, either yours or mine. Guys, do we have a connection problem a little? Can you? Yeah, I think yours maybe, or I don't know. Let me. Oh, Levan, your internet is a little bit lagging, but now I see you, but yeah. Now it looks good, yeah. Anyway, so you went to Atlantic City
SPEAKER_00: and you competed against Jerry, and you come back, how long did you rest? Like two weeks. Only two weeks? Yes. And then you started training? Okay. And then what was the reason that you started training so early? It cannot be because of Laletin match, was it? Yes, yes, because my...
SPEAKER_01: close and I started for La Lettine because I you know we talked about and I thinking I always La Lettine because I 100% I thinking to Hermes Wynne Michael and in this moment
SPEAKER_01: I know Hermes said he doesn't want to pull with me and it is the letting and that's why I started. Okay, but later Hermes changed his mind and Hermes said, instead of waiting end of the year, let me pull in June. If you knew this already,
SPEAKER_00: You would rest a little bit longer after Atlantic City? Yes, yes. I'd be starting much more slowly. Slowly, okay. And now, how much do you push yourself? You still have about three months, right? A little bit more, three and a half months. And now, do you really push limits already or still?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yes, I push but now I need a little bit stop because too much pain. I feel because when you're training too much in a long time, a little bit pain I feel in my hands. Now I need a little bit slowly.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe one week after that. Yeah, I would do the same thing. Because you push since the end of the December till the March. So probably you push about 20 and a half months. 20 and a half months you train so hard. Now you have almost three and a half months. I think it is good to have some break and no pain and then start again, you know. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And can I ask you something? If you didn't have any pain, how good you are right now? Were you already 80 percent, 90 percent? Yes, like 80, 85. 80, 85, yeah, yeah. And in your opinion, do you think that you will be
SPEAKER_01: 100% by June or you will be even better than your best ever? I hope I will be the best. But we will see. I don't know. I try to be in the best shape. I do everything for that. We will see how it goes in preparation.
SPEAKER_00: But I hope I will be. You don't have to answer, but do you think this match will be as tough as last time or harder or easier for you? I don't know. Now I train more seriously.
SPEAKER_01: Last time I tried for Hermes first time but not so hard. You underestimated him? Because I think Gasparini is very good but not too much.
SPEAKER_01: Not too much motivation to play with him. But right now do you have the motivation? Yes, now I have the motivation because I see how good he is now. How he beat Michael and Michael is now very strong.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about Michael when you see him? He looks very big, huh, Michael? Yeah, he looks very big and strong. Yeah, very big and strong, yeah. And now, one month before you will pull Hermes, there will be Michael versus Laletin.
SPEAKER_00: do you expect laletin to like some people says that oh laletin is gonna crush him and some people says that some people says that there is a possibility michael will stop him and some people says that even michael stops him because laletin has long uh forearm and he will pin him and some says no he will not be what is your opinion for me in this much um favorite is michael
SPEAKER_01: and Michael stop Lalletin 100% because Michael can stop everyone. I don't think Vitaly has too much good press to beat Michael. You are saying that even when we watch,
SPEAKER_00: Pushkar. When he tried to pin Michael Easy, he did two times. But the third time, fourth time, fifth time, and sixth time, the match was stopped. And then Pushkar had to win with the shoulder pressure last two rounds. And Pushkar was a very explosive guy. Pushkar's shoulder pressure is very strong.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was very strong, yeah. And Laletin is also very explosive. But what is the possibility Laletin to flash pin Michael? I don't think he can do that. I think in the last maybe two or three centimeters, Michael stopped him. And do you see...
SPEAKER_01: If Laletin can press good, he can win. But if he doesn't press strong, I think Michael can win. So it can be suddenly a nightmare for Laletin if the match stops. Because to beat Michael, you really need to know how to arm wrestle.
SPEAKER_00: Like, Hermes arm wrestled perfectly. If Hermes made some mistakes, he would be in trouble. And, yeah. So we know that Vitaly is probably more explosive than Hermes, but does he have the tools to beat Michael if he gets stopped? So we don't know that yet. Yeah. For Michael, not surprised how to...
SPEAKER_01: You need to go top roll and after give him wrist and press.
SPEAKER_00: but you need to do that good yeah yeah yeah not everyone can do that yeah i'm not saying laletin cannot do it but anyone who is thinking that there is no possibility to michael to win this they don't know much about arm wrestling i'm not saying michael is gonna win but there is a possibility that that night to become nightmare you know for me like 55 for michael 45 for laletin like this yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's interesting. So you are saying that if you beat Hermes, then your next opponent will be Michael? Because Michael, I think he's not going to pull anyone if he beats Vitaly. Yeah, I think he's going to wait for you. I think this is what I understand. Yeah, why not? Yeah. And another question for you.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think that Michael may be as dangerous as Hermes for you? No, no, no. You think Hermes is more dangerous? Yeah. I know how to beat Hermes and I know how to beat Michael, but the level is different.
SPEAKER_00: Hermes level is much more. Yeah, but is it only about the power or is it about the style also? I have a question. Do you think that you can just flash kill Michael or there is a possibility he'll stop you? I don't know. I don't know. When I pull with him, I try to do that, but I'm not...
SPEAKER_00: I don't know 100% that I can do that. Oh, you don't know 100% that you can flash him, yeah. But if he stops you, like, can I ask you something? If he stops you, you would just go directly to this or you would just climb, climb, climb and then do this? I think I need to press. Right away? As soon as he stops you? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: not not like how do Hermes like this because Hermes do like perfect perfect how to pull with Michael yeah I think Hermes is very good arm wrestler very good arm wrestler he's very smart and now he he's in very very good shape he's very in very good conditions
SPEAKER_00: I think that last year, because he didn't pull so much, I think his body gets so much rested because he rested a long time and I think that now his body is responding to everything very good. Yes, it is a big plus for him because one year to rest, he's not stopping training but maybe he doesn't push too much.
SPEAKER_01: recovery trainings maybe and now he looks very good and i think um he uh uh he write to pull with me now and not not uh wait and end of year i think i don't know
SPEAKER_00: why he needs to wait until the end of the year. Now he is in very good shape and we can do... Yeah. He also asked my opinion. Yeah, I think it was the right decision. If he doesn't have any pain or anything, then I think it is the right decision. Another question. You saw Devon at 300 pounds.
SPEAKER_00: he was probably very near to 140 kilos. The question is that do you think that this shape of Devon has more chance against you than before or it wouldn't matter? I don't know. When I see a match with Gennady,
SPEAKER_01: With much Gennady, I can't say how good now is Devon because I think Gennady is not close to his best shape. I think he has a problem after Peter's injury.
SPEAKER_01: But don't you think that with his shape, he's probably stronger than before or no? I don't know. If he shows us his lifts, what he did before and now, how much he's doing,
SPEAKER_01: um say progress if he can much more uh wait to take like maybe a back but um when i see him in the tbilisi i i not feel it it is uh in best shape i feel like he's he has too much water in body and
SPEAKER_01: When he pulls with Gennady, he has some problem with his techniques, like he cannot go closer with his hand, and a little bit
SPEAKER_01: uh i see a little bit uh problems when he pulled but um maybe we know we need more much uh to see devon maybe maybe i don't know michael or something um see how how strong he is how he can lift
SPEAKER_01: We remember he lived, when he preparation for me, he lived on pronation lifting and if he show how much he can do now and if he can do more, yeah, we can say, we can say he's more stronger than before.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I understand. I understand. You are saying that basically your opinion that Gennady wasn't in his best. And then you are saying that Devon needs to pull someone who is in their best shape. And then you will understand how good he is. Devon said that in August he is ready to pull Vitaly. And do you think that Devon and Vitaly should pull no matter who wins between Michael and Ladecin?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, why not? Because we need that match. For me, that match is where big interest, fans need to watch this match and why not, yeah? I think that match is most like...
SPEAKER_01: most like who um what to answer fans to see yeah yeah that's true that's true but if if michael crush uh relating like nothing what i don't think too um i don't i don't know but michael may win
SPEAKER_00: but to crash in like nothing yeah yeah it is not possible yeah yeah yeah i think there will be a war vitale will be aggressive and michael needs to stop him and tire him and then beat him yeah yeah i think uh we retaliate they they need to pull they need to show us how they pull okay dino is asking saying he didn't train serious for hermes is not true
SPEAKER_00: it says but um anyways there was a super chat um gb19 says levan you don't need tourniquet anymore i i think i mean you may need it but i i try to try to improve your english yeah yeah yeah you are you are improving yeah
SPEAKER_00: And I think there was one more or probably no. Okay. Yeah, I agree. I agree. They need to pull Devon and Vitaly should pull regardless of the result of Michael. But it depends, you know, if Michael wants to pull another right arm match before the end of the year or not. That is important because if Michael wins and if Michael wants to pull another match, I think that Michael versus Devon also would be a good match.
SPEAKER_00: yeah maybe uh if um maybe if michael win maybe uh jerry is very good much yeah anyways we will see we will see and like not much not much left you know and let's go and talk about the upcoming uh event east versus west uh
SPEAKER_00: Seventeen. You may not be familiar with every armwrestler, but let me ask you the ones that you probably have good knowledge about. For example, Giannis versus Mindaugas. That's a great top-roll versus top-roll match. And I think they both are very good technicians. Do you agree with that? Yeah. We'll have to say who will win. But it will be...
SPEAKER_00: great match yeah great match yeah yeah and so you don't have any clear i don't know okay okay okay and how about matt max versus kiddigan oh it it is top much when i uh um
SPEAKER_01: for this match to happen. I'm very happy because it is. And I'm very happy that Idilgali is back. And I wish him good luck. I don't know. For me, for Idilgali 100%, I support him in this match and I hope he will win.
SPEAKER_00: And let's go another match. This is a very, very good match in my opinion. I talked with Dave Chaffee. Dave Chaffee said that recently he is healthy and he is able to do so many exercises that he wasn't able to do for some time. And he's going to pull against Georgi Swetko. Very good match. Very good match, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. Georgi's coordination is very strong. But I think they can beat him with side pressure.
SPEAKER_01: Only side pressure or maybe he stops and then he does this? Or only straight side pressure? I think he cannot do that with Georgi. Evgeny if it is very close, just say that he comes and then this close to the pen, his wrist is going. Can he not do it if it's too close? No, no. Georgi can fight in this position very good and very long. And I think...
SPEAKER_00: Not too much good press he has to beat Gyorgy. So another question I want to ask you. You said that people cannot beat Gyorgy this way. Does it apply for the left arm as well? Just say that if Gyorgy would pull Kamil, do you think he would have some good resistance because his arm is stronger or
SPEAKER_01: We see how good Paul Georgi is with Jerry. How he fights. He's very good in that position. I think he can win Kamil. He can.
SPEAKER_00: But Kamil has very good progress. Every month, every event he was stronger and stronger. Q. He gave a very hard match to Vitaly. It was a very dangerous match for Vitaly. Do you think that Kamil vs Deserano left arm would be a good match?
SPEAKER_00: I remember Dezerhanov a few times beating Ladecim with left arm at WAF. I believe in Dezerhanov. In that match, I think Dezerhanov will win. Oh, you think Dezerhanov will beat Kamil with left arm? Because his arm is stronger? Yeah. That's interesting, yeah. And let's go to Devon versus Corey.
SPEAKER_01: They will say his left arm is very good now. How many rounds this match? Five rounds. You need to win three times.
SPEAKER_00: I think Corey won the first two rounds and after they won three rounds. So you are saying that it will not be easy? Yeah. So let's talk about greatest of all times versus Yoshinobu Kanai.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think we are very lucky to see this guy still at the table? Yeah, because it is a historical match. I've seen a documentary film when John pulled with Kanai in the documentary film Pulling John. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And I think it doesn't matter who we win because both of them are legends. And only to watch this match, it is very good for us. And for me, it doesn't matter who we win, they are legends.
SPEAKER_01: i i know it just be uh very good much and a little bit uh support uh john in this much yeah i mean listen yeah if like i cannot be john but if i knew
SPEAKER_01: i can be john i still wouldn't want it i would want john to win like i don't know yeah because he just so much he inspired us you know all all those years and but when i see how uh um yes it is big like oh it would be a big surprise and big surprise yes his hand is uh
SPEAKER_01: not open in this position. He can fight all day. I think John needs to press as much as he needs to use that technique.
SPEAKER_00: yeah but do you do you think that because like todd was able to bring him here but he couldn't finish but todd looks like doesn't have the shoulder pressure but john has it so maybe if john can bring it here john will have more chance to because kana is pulling like this yeah when somebody is pulling it is more vulnerable to the uh this one because i think we uh more time to see uh how
SPEAKER_00: how professor is pulling and teach us he is an armwrestling machine he is a winning machine we should respect that guy to me it will be a sad day once he doesn't pull anymore who knows maybe this is his last match we don't know yet I mean I hope not but I
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if I should say, but I think he will have some back surgery soon after this match. I really hope that he recovers. Maybe his pain will be less and we get to see him more. But if he decides not to pull anymore, then we will support him in any decision that he makes. Of course.
SPEAKER_01: What was that guy's name, the 110 kilo puller? That he was training with you? Ah, Sandro, Sandro Lampadze. How is his shape now? Is he still training with you? Yeah, yeah, we're together training now. Is he getting better? Irakli is back in the gym. He's training.
SPEAKER_01: I trained with Irakli and Sandro. He's in very good shape now. He's trying for the Georgi national championship to go to the European championship. He has very good potential. Yeah, I saw that, yeah. Last year I think he took third place in the world. I don't remember. Yeah, I think he was third place, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: yeah he like uh he he needs a little bit a little bit more progress and he he will be ready he has some some little bit uh um i would say a little bit time he needs time i i said to say to him to
SPEAKER_01: He needs to go in superweight, but he won't listen to me. I think he has big potential in superweight category. He wants to be superweight? He wants, but he... What's his weight? 150? Yeah, like this, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But is he doing diet to stay under 50? If he eats more, he can be bigger? No, no. For him, it is hard to... Gain weight. To gain weight? Yeah, to gain weight. For him, it's hard because he's working and he's working and he's training
SPEAKER_00: How old is he? He looks young. 25 maybe? No, 29. And he looks like a good guy. Yes, he's very humble and he's a very good guy. Can I ask you something, Levan? You see all the West vs West champions.
SPEAKER_00: Do you know what pound for pound means? No. Pound for pound means for his weight, how good he is. For example, at the UFC now, the pound for pound, I think Islam Makachevich was number one, I think John Jones was number two, or something like that.
SPEAKER_00: Like, for example, you are the strongest guy, but pound for pound for his weight, I think John is the best. You understand? Because of his weight. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. But what I'm just saying, like for the weight, you understand? So if you compare by the weight, pound for pound, who is the top five at the West versus West for his category? Like, do you think who is the best, like for his weight, who is the best, strongest guy? Hmm.
SPEAKER_01: I say top five, but I don't know who is first and second. Okay, so you don't know which one is number one. Probably Devon is there for his weight. Yeah, 100% Devon is there. David Samusha? David Samusha, Todd Hutchings. Todd Hutchings. Maybe Hermes for his weight?
SPEAKER_00: No, no. Irakli, I would say Irakli. Maybe Dadikian. With the right hand? Okay. So how about left hand? Who is the pound for pound number one, you think?
SPEAKER_01: Do you think Ali Can or Oleg Zok for their weight, maybe? Who is the pound for pound strongest guy with left hand? I think in future it's now Ali Can. Ali Can, Tatikyan. Zok, maybe.
SPEAKER_01: Were you surprised when Petrenko beat Oniyani that easy? Yes, I was surprised. Petrenko is a champion, no words, nothing. He is a champion, he is very strong, he is great.
SPEAKER_01: What I know, Oñan is living in Spain. He works like every day for 9 o'clock night. He has in one day, he has like one hour for training and it is
SPEAKER_01: i think it is not possible to preparation for the this big much much another question so before he say he has in week like five hours for uh only five five hours for training and i already start to uh think uh for that because on yani i think it is
SPEAKER_01: uh he he can be more more strong if he can uh train it more but before before this match the other matches he wasn't working he working but uh i i not uh thinking about this now he say that and uh i uh like i was sad because uh i know uh
SPEAKER_01: In one hour, you cannot train. For me, one hour like warm-up, you know. Ah, okay. Okay, I understand. Yeah. But Petrenko, Petrenko is... I think after Devon's match, Petrenko has changed. He's now more, more strong, more... more strong with his mentally, his...
SPEAKER_01: Cody is strong. He's changed. Another question. What's your weight right now? I don't know. 180, maybe? 82 or 83, like this. Any goal about your weight for the Hermes match? No, no. I need to stop. I need to...
SPEAKER_01: go a little bit down. I want to be with Hermes like 178 or 175 if I can. Okay between 75 and 78 that you want to be. And last time you were 190 kilo? When I go I'll be 192 I remember.
SPEAKER_00: but in much day i'll be like 190 and 188 or something okay okay i understand i understand anyways uh leon my friend
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to keep you so long because every time I invite you, I keep you for a very long time. Thank you, you are kind. Now is starting very good football match. Real Madrid match? You like it? No, I don't like it.
SPEAKER_00: I and my son will also watch now. Yeah, in 18 minutes. We support Paris Saint-Germain because Georgi guy is playing for Paris Saint-Germain. What's his name? Yeah, that guy is very, very good. All Georgi support now. We have also a Turkish guy who plays sometimes for Real Madrid.
SPEAKER_00: Turkish guy. He played in Inter. How is his name? Oh, yeah, yeah. Emir, who is playing in Inter? A Turkish footballer. Hakan Çalhanoğlu. Yeah, yeah, Çalhanoğlu. He's very good. My son is following more closely.
SPEAKER_00: than I do. In the past, I was really crazy and then I realized that the fanaticism that people... I support the all-time Italian club Juventus. Juventus, you told me. They are playing Turkish guys too. Yeah, Juventus. Emil, who is Juventus's player? Kenan Yıldız. Oh, Kenan Yıldız. Yes. Yeah, he's good. He's good. Yeah, very good. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, anyways, you guys did very well at the last European Championships. Your team, Georgi, and we were like very close match, very close. Yeah, very good match, very good match. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we always, I don't know, feel very close to our Georgi brothers. Yeah. Anyways, so, Levan, once again, thank you very, very much. Do you have any last words?
SPEAKER_01: to anyone, any of your opponents, to Hermes or your fans, anything? If you don't have it, don't feel pressured, but do you have anything that you want to say maybe to your fans? For fans of wrestling, I can say thank you for all who support me, who do not support me. This doesn't matter because they give us motivation.
SPEAKER_01: Who doesn't support, he gives us motivation more. So you are saying the haters motivate more? Yeah, yeah. I totally agree. Yeah. And for sports fans, I wish good luck to everyone, to stay healthy and stay strong. And I wait much with Hermes.
SPEAKER_01: And I know it has been a great match and historical match. Last match has been historical, very epic match, you know. Yes, yes, yes, yes. At that time some people made you a little bit upset, angry, but
SPEAKER_00: That is the part of being epic, you know, with all those comments, you know, good comments, bad comments, you know. But people celebrate it. You, even though you won, they celebrate it like you lost. Yeah, you understand? And because, do you know why it was? Levan, you look like a mountain. And people see that, like, nobody can beat Levan. Whenever they see that you have some problems, people are going, yeah, yeah, he's going to lose. You understand?
SPEAKER_01: So right now, a lot of people probably want you to lose, but not because they don't like you. I understand because every time you win one guy, you need to see a good fight or a new champion or something new. I understand.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, today we... I understand, but it is not possible. That's good, that was good, yeah. And today we share the poster of you, the strongest of all time. The reason that we wrote the strongest of all time, because you go ask John, you ask Devon, you ask Ermes, you know, everyone agrees. Like when you see
SPEAKER_00: When you see that people agree with right-arm Levan, then you need to give it. Same with John being greatest of all time. And we wrote there that undefeated in his professional career. And people say, no, Levan is not undefeated. And I try to explain to them, and they think the European World Championships are professional. They are not, even if you go and ask them.
SPEAKER_01: european federation go to ask european federation go to waf ask them are you professional organization they will say no we are amateur i think they are rich to uh in professional professional much yeah yeah yeah so i i try to explain but some people probably either they don't understand i lost in the georgian championship
SPEAKER_01: I have lost in European or World Championships, but after I go in professional, I'm not lost. Yeah, so that's what I try to explain to them, that while Europeans or the national championships, these are not professional, and no matter where you go,
SPEAKER_00: boxing or something that is how it is once you go professional it's totally uh different thing so yes you have some losses as an in the amateur when i say amateur championship it is not like people who are a musher the the the name of it that but there is still very tough competition it's a tournament not like one-on-one super match i can say if i not lose uh
SPEAKER_01: That I lost in the European Championship. If I didn't lose, I wouldn't be in that condition now. Because that loss helped me to grow. Become better and stronger. Yeah, that's for sure. We have 11 minutes for the Real Madrid match.
SPEAKER_00: and yeah thank you thank you very much levan thank you for everything and thank you we are happy and honored to have you on our stage and i wish you a healthy uh preparation i also wish hermes a healthy preparation um hermes is also very very good armistice very very good armistice he's like
SPEAKER_01: like really like yeah everything that he did at the table against michael and uh i have a big uh respect him for what he from italy for me when i live in georgia in georgia too many good athletes too many good good artists yeah i can pull with him training with him but when you uh
SPEAKER_01: From Italy, yes, they have very good athletes, but not too much, you know. He doesn't have so much competition and training partners as you guys have in Georgi. In Georgi, I have like 100 good athletes I can train with him.
SPEAKER_00: Italy, Lamparelli, and maybe 10 people, yeah. I understand, yeah. Usually we don't have a Western European guy, you know, being at this level, you know. Yeah, you're right. But Ermes is a very special guy, same as yourself. And once again, thank you very much. And tell your family, I say hello from my family.
SPEAKER_00: and yeah good good good take care thank you very much thank you bye-bye thank you
