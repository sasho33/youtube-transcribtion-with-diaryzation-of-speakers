SPEAKER_00: diptarus poetry in which month dennis siplenko is competing um i think sarah came as dennis had the hair transplantation so he will join us a little bit later hello hello sarah hello how are you good how are you good good how is the preparation good yeah i'm ready
SPEAKER_00: and you had some surgery or something with the left side yeah but that's what two years ago now yeah but how is it how is it good yeah i made a i made a full recovery oh so you are ready to pull left arm as well oh yeah oh okay both arms are ready okay okay that's good that's good so you will have more option
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah, I'm definitely ready for a left-hand match. We don't see, I mean, it's cool that Thea is a champion in both arms, you know, so it's definitely something I want to explore. Oh, you want to become champion with both arms? Of course. Well, which category? Okay. I will be honest with you. We have Barbara here and a little bit here we have Gabriela and then we have here Egle.
SPEAKER_00: There is some difference. And then if we judge by the last time you pulled Egle, there is some difference between you and her. And then after that, you are there. And now you lost against Jocelyn. And so we don't know how it will go this time. But it looks like Jocelyn... Am I pronouncing her name correct? Jocelyn? Yeah, Jocelyn. Jocelyn, yeah. Jocelyn, yeah, okay. So...
SPEAKER_00: So you can make 80 kilo. But in the overalls, before your Jocelyn match, you were fourth, but there was some distance between you and the top three. But after you, then there is some also big gap. You understand? Yeah. Yeah. If you talk about 80 kilo, and then so
SPEAKER_00: When you say that you want to become the champion with both arms, which category do you mean? Do you plan to go down to 70 or do you plan 80 kilos or do you plan to beat Barbara with both hands or what is your goal?
SPEAKER_02: yeah i mean i i completely agree with everything that you just said that's how i see myself as well yeah but like i'm far from done so in my mind no no nobody thinks that way but i just try to understand in a specific way what is your target when you say right and left i'm winning what is the category i would i would like to take barbora gabby
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you want to become the overall champion? Yes. Oh, okay. Yes. But I do weigh 78 kilo today. I don't know if I can make 70 because I'm so lean.
SPEAKER_02: Are you? Yeah. Yeah. And I haven't been 70 kilo in like 15 years. And I remember back then I struggled to make 70 kilo. Okay. In Kazakhstan, 2011, what were you? 65 or 70? 70. Oh, 70. So that's the last time you made? 2012 in Brazil. Oh, Brazil. Oh, okay. 70 kilo. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So you are, what did you say, 78 or 77, you said? 78 today. 78, okay. So you have about 17 pounds if you decide to make. Do you know those guys are doing all that crazy, like, water loss, you know, like, and then boom, and then going up? Like, have you ever tried such thing? I have. Everyone tells me, dude, water cuts. I have never tried it.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe I should try it one time. Not like in last three, four days, you know, not that much. I mean, the maximum I cut probably three kilo in last a few days, but these guys are cutting like 10 kilo, eight kilo. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, exactly. If the time is right, maybe I can be 70 kilos, but it just feels impossible. But if Fia or Malin or any of the girls in 70 kilos are okay with me maybe weighing 73 kilos,
SPEAKER_00: Maybe that would be cool. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see what happens. No, but what I'm just saying that with diet, what is the lowest you can make? Can you make like 73, 74 or 75? Yeah, 75 I can make for sure. 75. I think the only way is that like if you can really make 75 and then do some water cuts, then yeah, you and then...
SPEAKER_00: Fia, and what is the other young girl's name? I forgot. Elin? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And her, I think, yeah, all three would be... And then there would be a domination of Sweden. I know you are right now representing the US, but in everybody's memory, you know, you are also from Sweden, you know. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, yeah. And so...
SPEAKER_00: A lot of people have different opinions about your, uh, loss against Jocelyn. Some people says that I don't, I cannot say that, but that is one of the possibilities that like, because you are known or you were known to be the best North American female puller. And did it, did this cause you to go there?
SPEAKER_02: without being at your best? Did you underestimate the competition? Yes. I didn't know who she was until the week of the tournament. And people had said that there's a really strong chick from Canada. She bench presses 250 pounds, which is like 130, 140 kilos, right? And like, that's extremely impressive to me. So I remember
SPEAKER_02: seeing her and she's taller than me too. And I'm not short by any means, right? And so I was just like impressed and just thought that she will be my competition. And then it was around Robin format and she was so firm and she beat me fair and square and took me by surprise. I did look at the video
SPEAKER_00: which is like rare for me because usually I don't look at my losses but I did look at the video and I mean she's so powerful inside and so I need to stay out of that oh because it was round Robin you you pull her only once yeah okay so you didn't have anything to do any adjustments okay the question is that normally you are
SPEAKER_00: like I don't know about lately, but normally you are about 85 kilo and then you were making 80 kilo and things like that. So you said right now you are 78 kilo and you are about three weeks away, 23 days away from your competition and you are 78 kilo. Are you again underestimating her by being this light or this is,
SPEAKER_02: This has been your weight for some time and you feel as strong as you were. Yeah, exactly. I feel stronger now than I have been. And when I'm walking around 85 kilo, sure, I always feel strong, but I don't feel athletic at that weight. I feel puffy.
SPEAKER_02: You know, sluggish. And now I just feel like lean and crisp. I feel good. Healthier, faster. Exactly. Yeah. I always thought too that you don't need to have excess fat to be stronger. And as long as I feel good, like I'm progressing in my workouts, I get good feedback from my team that I'm getting stronger.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And when you lose weight, how does it affect your injuries? You know, like, usually, like, how do you feel? You are 78. But do you feel like you are, like, do you feel relaxed at that weight? Or like, it's not like you are right now killing yourself to lose weight or something?
SPEAKER_02: No, I'm eating a lot. I'm not restricting myself. I'm eating extremely healthy. I'm very good with my protein intake. I'm free. Knowing that I'm going against an open weight category, I'm not holding back. I eat for sure. Now I'm convinced that you can make
SPEAKER_00: easily 74 kilo and then some water cut you can probably get some information how to do that i haven't tried that that way that those mma
SPEAKER_00: fighters are doing and yeah and some of the helpless i think pauline knows how to do it very well and there are superchats zenzu says hey sarah any interest in pulling ayane and let me answer that she can answer that but ayane is like 60 kilo 55 kilo um i don't think they are in the same category to have a competitive match but what's your opinion
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but also I'm different. I don't care what anybody weighs. If anybody wants to pull me, I'll give them the match. You know, I don't care. And that's why I see myself, too. I don't care if somebody weighs more than me. I just want to be able to beat everyone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, like.
SPEAKER_00: It is kind of a little bit different like when 55 kilo girl pulling 80 kilo girl, and an 80 kilo girl is pulling open category. You know, it is just like a little bit like different, but still makes huge difference when the opponent is Barbara. I don't know her weight, which I shouldn't even be curious about it. GB19 is asking, Sara, are injuries or health issues holding you back?
SPEAKER_00: No, knock on wood. I'm good right now. I have nothing holding me back. Um, I'm able to push very hard in my training and I'm doing good right now. Okay. That's good. Yeah. But, but that, that you just gave some ideas about your, uh, future matches. Yeah. Yeah. Both 80 kilo and 70 kilo would be very good. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And how many times did you pull at the East vs. West? Twice, right? East vs. West 1? Yep, and 10. And then Egle match, yeah. And you beat Irina Dreyeva, correct? Right and left. Yeah, yeah. One was 4-1 and the other one was 5-0? Yes. Do you remember which one was 4-1? Right. Right was 4-1, yeah. Okay. Okay, and yeah.
SPEAKER_00: so now okay let's go back to the subject now you have jocelyn and you said that she beat you fair square okay i understand that part but compared to that time are you now stronger and
SPEAKER_02: better prepared yes um with all my losses it always fueled me to work harder because if i lose it's on me right like i didn't do everything i needed it's something i have to you know change in order to get better so
SPEAKER_02: was you know i like any loss it's always hard in the beginning but then it just motivates me to work harder and even though this match was set fairly recently i have been training with her in my mind you know like how long has it been six seven months or something uh the the match was may 17th last year yeah so almost when march it will be 10 months yeah yeah when you pull her yeah
SPEAKER_00: And the question, I don't know if you answered and I missed it or not, but were you at your best? Like compared to now, where were you? Like did you lose against her because you were not as strong, as prepared as you are now? Or because you had only one chance and because it's round robin and you didn't have
SPEAKER_02: another round to do something different like in your head what is the reason no i think that day she was stronger i did pull with her after after pool and but that's completely different everybody knows that um she's strong as you know and well when you said that it was completely different it means that the things went differently when you pull a side table
SPEAKER_02: Well, she's still able, she was still able to, you know, we're deep inside and I'm strong in there, but like, I can't match that power. Like she, like I said, like she bench presses, like,
SPEAKER_00: men wait you know but the thing is can you can you beat her now inside or you have outside strategy yes yes yes i i can i can beat her yes you can yes i'm stronger now i'm stronger today than i was in may so now if you look at all my lips you are ready for even inside game i think so okay so that that's what i but do you also do you also think that
SPEAKER_00: she's still new as far as i know in the sport i mean at least compared to you and do you also think that she also progressed since that time maybe you will not find the same person exactly um she when i talked to her then she said she was five years in so maybe five six years in now and she has won i think every match she has had
SPEAKER_02: since that time she she beat heidi cordner um it feels like she had someone else but i can't remember she lost to fia lefty at arizona she did not pull right arm that day um
SPEAKER_00: So she is well deserved number one in North America right now with right? Yeah, of course. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. So this is for sure is for number one, because you said that she beat other top girls from North America with right arm. Okay. So there is no doubt that this will be for the number one in North America. Yeah. Yeah. And did you have a chance to pull with your left arm after that event?
SPEAKER_00: I don't remember, honestly. I was so focused. She losing to Fia with left arm. I'm just curious, you know, how much difference between her left and right. Yeah. Yeah. I think she said that it's similar. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. Wow.
SPEAKER_00: That is very interesting, because if they are similar, and Fia about 70 kilos, sometimes not even 70 kilos, and flashing her, that's interesting. But Fia lately is, yeah, she's not normal, you know, she's too much, yeah. Would you ever, would you like to pull with her at some point?
SPEAKER_02: absolutely absolutely because that's one of those girls like she was my training partner when i lived in sweden and um she um i haven't pulled her in a tournament since like 2010 i mean that's 15 years ago so who knows right i'm very curious to see where we are compared to each other yeah yeah i think last time you pulled
SPEAKER_00: In Europe, was East vs. West one? Me and Fia? I mean, no, you pulled Egle and other Europeans. But other than that, Drieva and Egle, have you pulled any Europeans lately? Well, I pulled Anna Granlund. Yeah. That's it. That's it. I definitely want to compete more.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, but do you understand what I said at the beginning of the podcast and you agreed? About the gap, you know, like, no disrespect, but Egle looked very strong compared to you at that time. And I don't see anyone lighter than you beating you either. So you are somewhere like, I mean, do you understand? Yeah. You look too much to anyone? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: and then the the other top three looks but of course i'm not saying that you cannot beat them but i'm just only talking with what we saw last time yeah you know i and then very fair i saw barbara beating egg you have seen that much as well right yeah and then barbara also looks um i was expecting barbara versus eggly to be close
SPEAKER_00: I know. Me too. I know. And Baba, whenever we calculate like this, that Egle had a dominant victory against you, and then the Barbora had the same type of victory against Egle, and then whenever you say that you are planning to beat Barbora, Gabriela, and others,
SPEAKER_02: and is it because of like your some of your practice pools with with uh gabriella and then and then you you feel yourself maybe i'm not that far type of thing what gives you hope i mean yeah it maybe it helped a little bit to train with gabby at two different times and it's like four months apart and her and her husband both said that i'm strong and i'm
SPEAKER_02: i used to have some type of blockage like when it when it mattered when i needed to perform it was blocked and i couldn't like access to what i know i can do so like andrew i totally understand i i agree like what people have seen from me it's not that impressive lately no no it's impressive but those those girls are not your weight category yeah i mean yes i mean yeah barbara is
SPEAKER_00: not twice of you but probably at least 50 kilo heavier than you and and that to be fair you know that what you are trying to accomplish is uh like Tata Chinks is trying to beat Levan Saganashvili or something right right right but left arm like maybe right arm i'll never take the number one spot maybe but i do think there is a possibility with left
SPEAKER_00: I just feel way more connected with my left arm. And we haven't seen me and Gabi with left arm in 14 years, you know. I've never pulled Egle lefty, I've never pulled Barbora lefty, I've never pulled Barbora period. Which one would you prefer, you know, to pull left arm? Like, okay, what would you, no matter the outcome of this match that you're going to have with Jocelyn? Because Jocelyn and you are normally, are not in the same category.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, especially as of now, if you were 85, 86, I would just say it's plus 80. But now you are 78 kilos, so you are now 80 kilo category puller. So, regardless of the results, you know, that March 29th you win or Jocelyn wins, what would you want next for yourself?
SPEAKER_00: It doesn't matter. Like an 80 kilo match, egg the left arm or go down 74 and water cut and then pull Fia right or left, you know. If you would pull Fia, which arm would you prefer? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, honestly. With Fia, I feel like we need to figure out both arms.
SPEAKER_00: And actually with everyone, because no one knows where left arm is with the women. Yeah, so we just need to start having matches to see where everybody falls. Yeah, that's the reason I'm asking. If we are going to set you another match, you need to know what you want to do, what you can do. For example, if you would ask me now, a right arm match with Egle,
SPEAKER_00: you need to do something before that one, because last time he moved so close. But if you say left arm with Egle, then I would say, okay, let's try left arm as well. Or if you would say 70 kilo right or left with Fia, I would just say, let's go. I think you directly can go for a world title match for the 70 kilo category. Probably leaning towards, like, because I'm really enjoying
SPEAKER_00: my life right now and like getting leaner and getting like in really good shape so i would probably experiment the 70 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and and would you want like your first experience in the category directly fear or you would like to see yourself where you are at before such a big challenge or
SPEAKER_00: you don't think that there would be any any strength loss when you lose weight that's that's a good question right like i i don't know i think there might be some strength loss yeah we don't know yeah but you know what you can do you can just go down to around 75 and then train at the table and with the weights and if you see not much difference
SPEAKER_00: Then the water cut is not going to hurt you so badly. If it does not hurt anyone else, you saw Devin came from all the way and Petrenko front of us, he weighed 104.9. And then next day he was still very, very strong. I don't know if it is changing from person to person.
SPEAKER_00: um or maybe one day you just try without competition the water cuts you don't need to go 70 but you can maybe try when you are 76 try to do 73 or 72 exactly yeah with the water cut and then next day you train and you see yourself how much it affected you almost yeah yeah yeah that sounds like a plan yeah yeah yeah so now you versus jocelyn and
SPEAKER_02: for the North American number one. How do you see your chance? When I offered this, it seems like you liked the match. Yes, I really wanted this match. Because in my mind, I am stronger. So this is my opportunity to prove to myself and the world that last year,
SPEAKER_00: Yep. I had a bad day, but I'm coming in prepared and ready now. Yeah. I don't think you lost anything, you know, like, like you losing Egle. I mean, of course nobody wants to lose, but losing Egle doesn't really take much from, uh, beating Egle in the same way is not that easy.
SPEAKER_00: And if you would win, it would mean a lot. But, yeah, she's kind of, I don't know, she's over 180, right? Maybe 183 or something. Yeah, she is tall. Yeah. Big hands, strong hands. Very big. I know. She's like a different breed. Yeah. Yeah. But when you pull Gabriela last time, in my opinion,
SPEAKER_00: If you didn't make a mistake, if you didn't just continue going inside, inside, inside, and then last round you finally went outside, and then you toppled, and I think that, what was it, like 30 seconds or longer? Yeah, yeah, and I fouled out. Yeah, I fouled out. It was very long. It was on my side. Yeah, at least it was center. But if you would have done that right from the beginning, yeah, and...
SPEAKER_00: And then there would be more of endurance game, you know, and yeah. So, but you both were 80 kilo, right? 80 kilo category it was, yeah. It was, yes. It was, yeah, yeah. Now it is probably harder. I saw her, I don't think that she was far from Barbara. She lost the wrist.
SPEAKER_00: But she was still able to pin her. It was just, I see that her arm is very, very strong. But yeah, the hand size and the arm height, you know, and things like that. And she doesn't seem to have the same endurance Barbara has. Exactly, yeah. She's more explosive.
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. You've got to prepare for that going into a supermatch because it can be extremely draining and long. I think they should also pull a left-hand match for world title now. Gabriela has that title and we need to do a left-hand match as well between them. What do you think about those girls, Gladgaya, coming and losing?
SPEAKER_00: And then the other girl, Niki Seva, coming in, losing FIIA. Do you think that now the level is different or because of the sanctions that they can't pull internationally, do you think that they stay behind because of not having competition?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think the same thing for me. I go months and years without a match. And even if I train, it's very different when you're on or off. When you're in the momentum and you're riding that wave and you know that you have so many matches lined up. I remember back in the day when I was on my prime, I competed every month.
SPEAKER_02: at least and it was like you get used to it it's a momentum so glad kaya like she was not competing for a for a long time she did good though like if she wasn't it wasn't like three zero or anything it was like three two i think
SPEAKER_00: So she did it. Which one was it? Oh, you mean the Gladkaya? Yeah, Gladkaya. She did good. Who had the buckle side? Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't really believe that the buckle is making that much of a difference for some people. I know. I mean, I don't know why Whitney, I never, like, I don't know. I never experienced, like, I mean, such thing. I mean, if I am this side, if I am winning, I go out the side and I win again, you know. But I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: But you're also very different. You have a different mindset maybe. And also you have to train with the bottle. Is it the mindset or also because of the salad wrist? Do you think that...
SPEAKER_02: It is, I don't know. Yeah, if you believe that, oh, no, I have the buckle. I mean, 50% of the times you're going to have the buckle. If I think just a slight negative thought that, oh, no, I'm at a disadvantage, that's going to affect you in my belief. Like, just fight. Like, it's going to happen. Do you think it's only psychological? Do you think it's only psychological?
SPEAKER_00: not all but like majority majority yeah uh-huh okay okay yeah i understand yeah oh so you are saying that i am different is it because of mental things you are saying yeah but yes right now everyone is talking about that maybe i will feel the same but listen how can you depend on such thing you know how can you depend if you want to be champion you need to i mean like just imagine when you go to wolf you don't know which side you are gonna be
SPEAKER_00: You understand? They are going to call you in. You don't have five times opportunity or three times. You need to win. Exactly. You just need to get it over with as fast as you can. Yeah. While we talk about me, I just can't have the motivation anymore. I just like downstairs, I made gym and
SPEAKER_00: so that i wouldn't be lazy to go somewhere to train and now i don't even go downstairs you know i go downstairs i go downstairs and i look at the weights weights look at me i'm not i don't want to do it but it's okay though again because you you it's a new era for you it's a new chapter you you wrote many books here now you're writing new books new chapters don't you think that it is a pity i know it will not sound how
SPEAKER_00: to never go to the table again. Like, to me, if I look at it from objective eyes, I would just say that at this level of the arm wrestling, you know, in our time, we didn't have this king over the table. And now Neil Pickup calls it Jurassic Park. You know, whenever I see all those monsters in every event up to 15, 16, 17 matches, now we want to do a little bit less. People say that it's too long.
SPEAKER_00: So knowing it, I think that he needs to be here. But if you ask me, do you want to pay the price? No, I don't want to pay the price. I need to lose weight. I have so much problems now.
SPEAKER_00: I have another problem in the last three days that we say something different, but I don't know how to say in English, that you can't put your feet, it hurts, something is sticking. I don't know what it's called, yeah. Sounds painful. Yeah, I mean, I'm just getting old, I guess that's what it is. But then I look at Tatachings and then I'm like, why is he not getting old? Yeah. Are you guys the same age?
SPEAKER_02: No, he's eight years older. But the only thing is, the only difference is that he started armwrestling when he was 35. Yeah, exactly. I started 20 years younger, you know, than that, yeah. Yeah, I mean, but also, like, I have a lot of respect for someone that had an incredible career for themselves. But now, you know, you're also, you know, coach, you're giving your knowledge to other people and you're providing a platform.
SPEAKER_02: to provide what you experienced, what you missed out on, basically, what you needed, the stage and everything. So to me, you're playing the game just perfect. You have nothing left to prove. You're doing it right. I agree. Sometimes I want to say the same thing. I know you wouldn't sound humble, but I know as knowledge, as a trainer, as someone who can do analysis, as an athlete,
SPEAKER_00: Even I would do reffing, I'm sure, at a very high level because I know what athletes are doing and everything. And organization. But I still think that I miss being an arm wrestler at that stage. Feeling that adrenaline. And sometimes I'm thinking I can't handle that pressure anymore. I know. I know. It's a lot. Yeah, it's a lot. Especially at this stage.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know how you guys are feeling, how the other athletes are feeling, but it's a big pressure, big pressure. It is, it is, yeah. Anyway, so you said that your left arm is ready to pull. Yeah, I didn't know that. I know you, before that you hurt the right side, right, at the WL.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, like stupid. I had the same injury on both shoulders. Yeah, this is what I'm saying. The same exact thing, right? Same exact thing. Yeah, three years apart. And the left arm happened during what? One day it started to hurt. If something happened, I can't pinpoint exactly when, how or where it happened. It just started...
SPEAKER_02: be painful. And I walked around with it being painful six months didn't do anything about it. That was just like neglecting the side and then I did an MRI and bullet torn subscapularis like unbelievable. Okay, let's let's talk about generally what's going on you do you enjoy the events watching events?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Oh my God. Like the arm wrestling has got to this point. That's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's like a huge festival, you know? Yes. Yes. Every, every, every one and a half months. And now we will have in, in, uh, Arlington, Arlington, the venue will be incredible. Will you be there? Uh, no, no, no, no. Why? Uh, long story.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Yeah. Hopefully I will be in Kazakhstan in May. And yeah. So we, okay, let's start from a very strong one. Yanis Amorins versus Mindago Starosaitis. How do you see that match?
SPEAKER_02: I think Giannis will pull it off just because to me, Giannis is like the goat in that category in this time, in this era. Um, I don't think he accepts a match without knowing. Yeah. Like he knows his limits and if he's injured, he would probably say no, if he wasn't there. But what do you think?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly. Listen, best of Giannis versus best of Mindaugas, they both have very good chance of beating each other. It may be up to that day performance and that shape. But only one thing I know, if Giannis and Mindaugas pulls every month one super match, most of the times I believe Mindaugas would win because he's younger, he's ready all the time. While Giannis really needs to be
SPEAKER_00: Like feeling good. He needs to be feeling good. Same as with me. Any guy that you put there, I beat him. Maybe other 11 months, they would beat me. But if I get ready, which is very hard, but once I get ready, we are like a more like broken Ferrari in the garage. But once you fix it, you understand, it goes fast. So best of Giannis, best of Minda was very close match. And...
SPEAKER_00: I think that this will be that match because as you said, Yanis wouldn't accept a match if he didn't feel good. And whenever I asked this match to Yanis, I had to say a few words to encourage him. I said, Yanis, we are not getting any younger.
SPEAKER_00: I know he's younger than me. He's probably eight years younger than me, but he is also over 40. We are not getting any younger. I mean, today you may feel, at first I asked him, how do you feel? He said, I feel pretty good. And he said, I did this much of weight with that. So I made sure that he feels good. And then I offered. And then, and then I said, we are not getting younger. You know, while you feel good, pull him because later maybe you will not even feel, maybe you will feel even better. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: And then he accepted. So if he accepted, it means that he's ready. So best of Yanis. I cannot say that Mindaugas for sure would beat him. I cannot say Yanis would for sure beat Mindaugas because Mindaugas is also a special individual. They both are masters at the table. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. And you, who's winning?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think Giannis will win. I know Giannis as a person, like he's a friend and I want him to win, you know, because I like him and I want him to win. Okay, but this is because you know him and you like him as a friend or do you also think that it is...
SPEAKER_00: like technically technical analyzing you know yeah exactly i think janice will pull it off i think he's ready okay alan is asking can't wait for east versus 17 the card looks great my wife and i will be there for our third vip experience good luck sarah we will be cheering for you thank you thank you alan for your thank you
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And, okay, there is one problematic person in the, and this guy, JB19, is crying, and he missed my Super Chat. I remember he saying that, Sara, you are beautiful. This is what he was saying. Yeah. And he has been crying. He has been crying that I didn't read the Super Chats. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so let's go to another match. Ongarbe versus Mask. Yeah, like what a good match this. I always say this, right? Like it can't get better. And then it somehow always like gets better, right? Yeah. And you wait for the next ones.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, exactly. But as far as that match, I mean, I love both those guys for their passion for arm wrestling, how they appear when they compete and everything. I've always said that I'm Matt Mask's biggest fan because I love how he flips the switch when he competes.
SPEAKER_02: he unleashes whatever it is and just goes to town, right? Now, Ungar Bayan, he has to travel. I don't know if he's ever traveled overseas, you know, if that's going to affect him in any way. But I know that he's doing everything on his end back home, you know, so I don't know. I don't know, honestly. I think Mad Mask has an advantage of being in North America.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think? I'm an organizer, so yeah, I don't know. I would like 99% of the times I only say my opinion if it is 50-50. Then I say it. If I don't think it's 50-50, I don't say it. So you don't think this is 50-50? You think one is going to beat the other? I...
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I can say this is 51-49 or 52-48 for one side, but I'm going to keep it for myself. But it is very close, I also see. It's very close. Okay, so let's go, let's go, another match. We have Valen Low from Singapore versus Hunter Knows. Do you know...
SPEAKER_00: Both guys? I know Hunter. I don't know the other guy, unfortunately. Okay, then it is very hard for you to have an opinion. Okay. Cody Merritt versus Evgeny Prudnik left arm match. Yeah. Isn't that a big weight difference? Yes, there is. Yeah. Do you know about how much?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know Cody's weight right now, but I think that Evgeny is around 110 kg. But just remember, if Evgeny was 6 kg heavier, his category would be super heavyweight. So when Devon pulled Levan, he was around 120 kg. So when it's a super heavyweight, 115 kg and over, then some people complain, you know, oh, Levan is so heavy. I mean,
SPEAKER_00: Listen, if he's so heavy, then pull under 115 kilo. This is super heavyweight category. I know some sports have the weight limits, but we are not going to, like, provide arm wrestling to some people because they are big, you know. So, I mean, you can complain. You cannot pull super heavyweight and complain about it. And just pull 115 kilo if there is huge difference.
SPEAKER_00: You know, I'm not talking about Devon. There are a lot of people are complaining about Levon's weight. What do you want the guy to do? You know, just cut his leg? Exactly. Yeah. No, it's true. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Krivnik is so sharp, right? Like he's so strong, but so... Not lately. Lately, he has lost...
SPEAKER_00: Ali Can, badly. Irakli Zerakashvili, badly. And Tata Sings, he showed some resistance, but still the match never looked like he was going to win even one round. So he has a losing streak. But I don't know how he's going to... We know that Cody's left arm is his stronger arm. And yes, Rudnick is a master. Rudnick, if he's in good shape, he's...
SPEAKER_02: Incredible. But I don't know how good he is. I know that he wants to be back to that shape again. You go ahead, sorry. Well, with that being said, I think Cody will win then. Because Cody's left arm, that's his good arm. He's super strong. And even though I have known Prudnik since I was like 14 years old,
SPEAKER_02: I have paid more attention to what Cody's been up to lately than Prudnik. So even though I have watched the events, I did not remember Prudnik losing that many matches. Yeah, recently, yes. So yeah, I think Cody will win them. 2009 Europeans, were you there in Bulgaria? Yes, yes. Do you remember Prudnik and Pascal? Pascal, oh yeah. Ten minutes, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And that was a very young Krutnik. Yeah, exactly. He had long hair. I remember. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And now we have John. I don't know if I'm pronouncing his last name right or wrong. John Terry. Do you know from Canada? John? No. John Terry. Yes. Yes. Oh, great guy. Yeah. Terry. Yeah. And Craig Tullier, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that match is going to be sick. I think everybody wants to see this. Yeah, that is another Canada versus US. I know. For number one. Yeah, for number one. Very cool. Okay. Yeah, I know. In my mind, off the bat, I think Craig will win. Uh-huh.
SPEAKER_02: But I also know that Craig is dealing with the shoulder issues and. I don't know how his health is recently. He was a year ago when I talked to him. I mean, a lot can happen in a year, obviously. Yeah. And I don't know. Yeah. But like my point is, even though he's struggling with the pain, he always wins. He always something on my screen. I look like I'm frozen. Is it the same for you? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, let me go out and then come back. Okay. One second. I don't know. One second. I don't know why this happened. It doesn't look bad, though. Like your eyes are open and you look fine. Yeah. I don't know why this happened, but... Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: One second. I can try to match it. Is it okay now? It's okay now. Okay. Okay. That's good. That's good. Yeah. Okay. So you are saying that who's winning that match, Craig or, uh,
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think Craig will win. Okay, okay. So Craig, you think, is favorite in that match. Okay, let's go to another one, another match. Devon versus Cody. Yes. Sorry, sorry. Corey, Corey, Corey West. Corey West, yes, yes. Yeah, yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: left arm you know i i think devon devon will beat corey i think i think so i don't know yeah right from the beginning the domination or you would at the beginning you expect the war i can see like corey maybe win the first match because he has
SPEAKER_02: horsepower but i don't think corey has good endurance i think he might get one win but devon will play his game and tired corey out and blow his arm up and then i think devon will take it from there i understand yeah so early rounds you give a little bit ash to corey and then later rounds you are giving to devon yeah yeah okay
SPEAKER_00: And then let's go, this one I only ask the percentage. No, no analyzing. Sarah versus Jocelyn. Percentage? Yeah. So like a hundred percent to me? Oh, you say a hundred percent? Yes. So you are saying a hundred percent you're going to win? I do. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, it means that you must be in very good shape. You must be in very good shape, yeah. Or is it your mindset for every match that you had before? Yes, exactly. I don't go in with doubts. If they had this conversation privately, would you still say 100%? Yes. Okay, so it means that you are very confident and
SPEAKER_00: You are very well prepared. Let's see how it will go, yeah. And Dave Chaffee versus Georgi Svetko. Percentage again? No, no, analyze. Analyze. Okay. Dave Chaffee looked good last, in December, right? Yes, he looked very strong, yeah. And he said that he has been healthy. And he said that there are things that he couldn't,
SPEAKER_00: do before. Now he's able to do all those exercises. Yeah. He says his elbow is good. His neck is better. So it means something, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If he's feeling good, I have a lot of faith in Dave Chaffee. I think he will beat Georgie. I understand. I understand. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And, and any, any like deep, uh, analyzing how the match would go?
SPEAKER_00: Do you expect to win like this or just go and lose the wrist and battle? What match? Their match? Dave Chafee? Yeah. I can't give you that. I don't know. You can, yeah. Okay, before we go to the last match, what is your favorite thing at the East vs. West and King of the Table? Which category takes your...
SPEAKER_00: Or which athlete takes your attention that you can't wait to see? Or does it not, it's not about the athlete, but it's about the match? Like, or do you have favorite pullers? Yeah, I mean, it depends, right? Yeah, like this last time, I was super excited for Malin and Thea. So that was like... Were you, like, did you expect to go such way?
SPEAKER_00: No, I thought it would be a little different. About the results or about the difficulty of the rounds? The difficulty of the rounds. We were expecting Malin to be dominant without the strap, or at least be better, but even without the strap,
SPEAKER_02: Malin was barely sleeping. This is what I remember at least. Exactly. It didn't seem like she had that feistiness that hits that she can usually pull off. Or Fia is just that much stronger now that it didn't matter.
SPEAKER_02: anyhow like fia looked extremely impressive yeah that's it this is what i was gonna ask you do you think that marlene because of going down from 80 kilo to 70 kilo do you think she lost something absolutely yeah so like she she cut weight for like two or three months and when you do that cut it takes time for the body to stabilize if you're not doing a water cut so she probably weighed 70 kilo day of the tournament or you know yes yes yeah so she like just dieted down and
SPEAKER_00: It takes a good couple of months to stabilize, I think, if you do it that way. I understand. Michael vs. Hermes, did you enjoy the match?
SPEAKER_02: yes so that was one of the big ones that i was looking forward to just because i love both guys so much and i know how much arm wrestling means to them so it was like extremely emotional um i did think that it was gonna be longer i expected it to be like an hour show for that match alone
SPEAKER_02: I did think that the refs called some things prematurely in a couple rounds. Because I've seen Michael Todd
SPEAKER_02: come back from almost an impossible angle. So I feel like that was interrupted and disturbed by being called maybe when it wasn't a for sure pin. I think we repeated that round. I think that round was repeated, yeah. Yes. But still, even if you have to... I talked with referees. I said, just check the camera. And then they checked the camera.
SPEAKER_00: And I said, they are still up there. I said, guys, you know, either say that Hermes won and then tell the guys to go down or say that you are not sure about the pin and then repeat the match. Why are we waiting, you know? And then they said, we are not sure. And then we repeated the round. And what did you think about, go ahead, sorry.
SPEAKER_02: No, even if they got another chance, that moment is lost. In the next round, both will have less strength, less mental focus maybe. It will go down all the time. But would you say that if the round continued?
SPEAKER_00: You are saying that Michael was winning? No, I think Hermes would have won still. Hermes is on a different level right now. I mean, listen, beating Michael takes much more than strength alone. You really need to have all kind of tools and even the right timing, right strategy and also power. And I don't remember many guys flashing Michael. And
SPEAKER_00: Hermes did everything right. That's what I talked with John as well. He said, Hermes did everything perfectly. If he would have made any mistake, it would cost him bitterly, just terribly. Because Michael, I saw with my own eyes, he was huge. He was over 300 pounds. He was a giant. Yeah, seriously. He was very, very strong. And I was amazed also.
SPEAKER_00: Morozov and Vitaly especially the round one when he stopped him and then he was to do show you know he was screaming Davai Vitaly Davai you know and you are not you are not so stranger to those Davai words you know from your buff years yeah you have you have heard a lot a lot of yeah yeah yeah and it was incredible match it was incredible and if we go forward now we will have Michael versus Vitaly Laletin match in May
SPEAKER_00: And then that is another match to be right now. Hermes is going to pull Levan. And then we have Vitaly versus Michael. Devon said that he wants to rest till August. And so we will put Michael versus Vitaly. And a lot of people think that Vitaly is very clear favorite, while Vitaly himself said that I think because of the style, the defensive style,
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that Michael is even a more dangerous opponent for him. How do you see this match? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think Michael Todd should be discouraged because he looks really good and mentally good lately and breaking numbers all the time in his lifts. So just because he had that performance against Hermes, I think he can do very well versus Vitaly. So I think
SPEAKER_02: Michael Todd can pull it off, because I don't think anybody has that endurance to be able to sit in different positions for that long. It's just a very unique style that he has. Yeah, very, very dangerous. A lot of people criticize him, and I don't have any criticism as long as his shoulder is above and he pulls that way.
SPEAKER_02: But a lot of people who criticize him, trust me, they wouldn't want to pull against Michael. No. And also, I think it's gotten better, though. Because there was a time where I thought that it didn't look so good. But lately, in the last few years... No, no, his shoulder is above now. Yeah, exactly. I have nothing bad to say about him at all. I agree. The way he fights. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I totally agree. And the thing is that
SPEAKER_00: When you think about Michael, probably him being flashed by opponents in the last 10 years is probably 2%. Do you understand the percentage? I have seen Pushkar flash him two times, and then two rounds Michael won, and then last two rounds Pushkar still couldn't.
SPEAKER_00: flashing, but he had to finish with the shoulder pressure. So flashing, Michael flash spinning is very difficult. You saw how Hermes did everything, you know. And we know that Vitaly is a very explosive guy, but what if somehow right here the match stops? Like, does Vitaly have the tools to do everything those well-rounded guys have done? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So I don't know about that. Suddenly we may see something that people didn't expect. And the last thing, Ermes and Levan, you know they had some tough rounds at the third round and the fifth round. And now they both know each other. A lot of people
SPEAKER_00: A lot of people disrespected Levan in that match, even though he was the winner. And those people who praised Hermes, now they are saying that he doesn't have a chance or things like that. I don't know why people have to go with those extreme comments. Either they make you right here, and then tomorrow they bring you right here. They never do the judgment in a calculated way. I don't know if they like the extreme.
SPEAKER_00: either you are terrible or you are incredible you know the king has died and the long live the new king yeah and how do you see this one we know that they both took some lessons from the last match and levan is coming just to prove that that was a one-time thing that he had thrown
SPEAKER_00: And while Ermes is coming here to prove, Ermes told me his biggest dream is to wake up in the morning. And I'm number one in the world. He wants to wake up like that. I feel it. I feel it. Yeah. Yeah, of course. We all feel it. We know. And I don't know, Ermes believes in himself.
SPEAKER_02: And how do you see? For sure, Hermes is not going there to lose. I cannot say he's not going to lose, but he's not going there to lose. So how do you see? Yeah, I mean, when he had that match against Levan, he showed that there's a lane, right? He showed that this can happen. So he's the guy to do it, I think. And I don't know, there's something with
SPEAKER_02: Not taking anything away from Levan, because he's the champ, right? For a long time. But when you stay there, you may get complacent and comfortable, even if you know that you have people chasing you. But having the hunger that Ermes is feeling, it can really move mountains. I saw it with Heidi Andersson when she beat Makeva.
SPEAKER_02: Left and right arm, you know, she had that. I think one arm in America, right? Yes, left arm, 2010. And then the right arm. Kazakhstan? Yes. But that was that long time dream, right?
SPEAKER_02: watched for so many years and that that was all she wanted that was and like she retired after that rightfully so and never even thought of coming back because what else does she need to do like she beat the one you know she did what seems impossible so like it's doable and Hermes is the guy to they can pull it off in my opinion okay so
SPEAKER_00: so you are saying this as a possibility or you believe this is going to happen i believe it's a possibility yeah yeah i mean because because with what we have seen so far it is impossible to say that levan is not favorites against anyone yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: anyways sorry it has been one hour and thank you for being our guest and i wish you i wish you a healthy preparation and good luck i also wish your opponent good luck i will i will she will be my guest on saturday and yeah if if you if you consider making 70 then then you are gonna open a lot of
SPEAKER_00: uh possibility yeah the competition over there even there even the competition like fia looks so strong to compare i don't know how how she would do with ellen uh but other than ellen i don't know what she goes she dominates comes to east versus west she dominates she goes to european she dominates so 70 kilo only ellen looks like you know some uh
SPEAKER_00: possibility and and if you make 70 you you look like that you have the possibility to be a serious challenge you know yeah yeah i will i will consider it i'll i'll complete this match and yeah yeah yeah just focus on this one first yeah this is also important yeah but but i'm telling you regardless of this match result yeah for 70 kilo
SPEAKER_00: that right maybe one event left another event you know that that that that match is for sure secured match you know that for sure yeah anyways once again thank you very much and thank you tell tell uh your hobby i said hello yeah yeah i will thank you bye
