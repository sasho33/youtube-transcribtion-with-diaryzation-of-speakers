SPEAKER_01: everyone. Hello, Georgi. How are you? I'm feeling good. That's good. That's good. That's great. So, let me understand your form. Can you do like this? Wow. Yeah. Huge. Yes. So, I guess you are in good form.
SPEAKER_00: I think that I'm in pretty good shape and I'm big, strong, I have no pain in the arm and I think this is a good shape now for me. That's good, that's good. And do you follow your opponent, what he says, how is his form and things like that? Yeah, he told me that, I saw that he made a post that
SPEAKER_00: he feels no injuries and he's in much better shape than before and he said that it will be a very close match yeah and what do you think i think that you it will be a good match but i think that i will win uh-huh okay i'm confident you're confident yes do you think that do you think that they
SPEAKER_01: is not confident or like when he says 50 50 or he is realistic or he is just making you feel like relaxed and too comfortable or is it a strategy or he's saying really how he feels i don't think that this is a strategy i think that he
SPEAKER_00: really thinks that it will be a close match because he knows what he is capable of and I also know what he is capable of and I think it will be a good match. What is he capable of? I think that he is one of the strongest when he is not injured. What is his weapons? He is powerful in inside, side pressure.
SPEAKER_00: Without wrist, you saw him against Vitaly last match. Vitaly beat him without the strap. When they go in the strap, Dave destroyed him. Vitaly said that, I asked him the same thing. Vitaly told me that if he wanted, he would beat him in the strap as well. He allowed him to go to his sweet spot instead. No, I think that if Dave was smarter to go in strap, Vitaly has no chance.
SPEAKER_00: Dave will stop him and... You saw what happened, it's my opinion. No, I understand. I'm also saying Vitaly's opponent, who was actually in the match, but who knows, yeah. Yeah, but Dave is very powerful. He beat also Alex, so... A lot of people underestimate him, but he's one of the strongest. Can you... Okay, I will be very brutal with you, okay? Because that is more tougher, you know?
SPEAKER_01: more real. Are you vulnerable for side pressure? Of course, this is... If I top roll somebody and if he's very powerful side pressure, it's a problem for me. But I... Okay, but just say that you didn't top roll and the wrist is like this. Do you... Okay, the thing is, do you agree that Dave has better side pressure than you from the center?
SPEAKER_00: Not talking about top rolls, not talking about hand control, but this. I'm not sure because I'm now trying to improve this very much. And this week I'm going to Tutra Khan to train 10 days with Sasho and Krasi. And I'm training only this side pressure. So I want to improve this very much. You are training with who you said, Krasi Miran? Yes, I'm going now this week to train 5-6 days with him.
SPEAKER_01: Krasimir, huh? Okay, okay. And also Stasov. Stasov. But do you agree that, like, Dave's, you know, with the pronator control, side pressure is, compared to them, is probably stronger, right? Stronger, yeah, but... Yeah, yeah. Because he's heavyweight, you know, but... Yeah, yeah, yeah. They will be very good partners for me for this match, I think, in my opinion. Yeah. Usually, Georgi, that we know, has very good hand control, wrist,
SPEAKER_01: and front wrist and, but you usually over pronate. You don't really like bottom side of your hand and the top side of your hand, ulna and radius. If your ulna is 50, your radius is hundreds. So lately you are balancing this because you, even you don't want your arm is whenever you attack, it is moving.
SPEAKER_01: dave also has very strong pronator and a side pressure do you think you will be able to control here how do you think you will be able you because once you go like this i think you will feel his side pressure but if you can control here then it's different i will try to control the side i will try to control here not only uh-huh okay i'm trying to improve this
SPEAKER_01: Okay, do you think there is a risk while you're trying to control here, you won't be attacking here, while you're trying to control here, you may be going with him? Do you think that? I don't think so. Okay, okay, yeah. My hand control is much better than his. Your what? Your hand control? My hand control and pronator. Yeah, yeah, I understand, yeah. Orda Numba.
SPEAKER_01: He says, Dave's wrist doesn't stand a chance. Let's go, he says. And Recto says, love from Macedonia for Georgi and revenge to Alex, he says. Yeah. Anyways. So another thing that, do you think that if somehow Dave takes the center,
SPEAKER_01: and goes halfway to the winning position, and if you take his wrist, do you think that it is dangerous, his side pressure would be dangerous, or you think that there is no way that he can dead-wrist press you? I think that he is very dangerous, but I think that my endurance is much better than his, and he will be not able to pin me in that way. It will be a long match, but you saw...
SPEAKER_00: And even if he pins, you just say once. Can he do that three times? You saw my match with Jerry. So I don't think that... I don't think that Jeff is stronger in that position than Jerry. So... And I think that now I'm much stronger than my shape against Jerry. Yeah. The only difference between Jerry and Dave that Jerry directly dives here and then you have the cup. But...
SPEAKER_01: Dave starts with outside pronation and keeps your wrist straight, and then he presses. So Dave, if he presses, he will be pressing more like far, while Jerry will just dive in here. And then you didn't have any threat to the ear. So do you agree that there is a difference between that? A little difference, but I think that Jerry is better in the endurance. OK, endurance, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Your match with him was the last match, and we had 16 matches. And there were so many good matches, like Ungarbe versus Michael, as far as I remember. Am I wrong? Was it like that? Yeah. All card was amazing. Amazing. And we were like, all the adrenaline was gone. And then we were just looking, watching your match.
SPEAKER_01: And then it was like, is it real? It still continues, you know. You guys were like, I mean, forever there. Like, the whole match was very long, yeah. And it was 3-2, right? 3-2, yeah. People were thinking that he will stop me and after that I will die. But it didn't happen. I was attacking to the end, you know. It was a very close match. Very, very good match, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The only unfortunate, you know, about that match was that it was after 15 matches. If it was earlier, it would be even crazier. But at the end, like, we didn't have so much energy. It was a very long event and people were, you know, exhausted. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We were exhausted. You are right, you are right, yeah. Anyway, so you are basically saying that you are planning to control these pronators.
SPEAKER_01: You are basically saying that you will do your best not to go to the losing side. Yes. Because you're training your side pressure. And you are saying that even the match ends up here, he won't be able to pin you three times for sure. This is what you're saying. I'm sure about that, yeah. Maybe one time he can pin me, but the next rounds, I think...
SPEAKER_01: He will not have the endurance to do that. You know, we train sparring every day, two, three times a day. I don't think that he will have this endurance on the table. I understand. I understand. Yeah. Do you think that because of these events and because of the level of the competition, you guys are, how to say,
SPEAKER_01: getting better and better by just countering the opponent's ability. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes, I think that after each event, after each year,
SPEAKER_01: All of us are improving. This Giorgi now, I think he's stronger than Giorgi last year. It's my... For sure, for sure. I believe so. My results in the gym, on the table, how I feel. Yeah. I'm sure especially at the table. Because whenever the competition level is, you know, really like high, and whenever you have very tough opponents,
SPEAKER_01: Many of them are well-rounded. You need to really prepare yourself for them. When the competition is lower, you're going to force yourself for that level. But when it is higher, then you need to really be prepared. Either you're going to be successful or you will be out of top 10. So that's why you need to force yourself. And Dave says that we will see him in top 10 very soon.
SPEAKER_01: I think that he deserves to be there, because I told you, for me... Listen, for him to be in the top 10 soon, he needs to beat you. Yes, but I will try to not lose, you know. You are saying that maybe next time, but not this time, huh? Yeah. Yeah, okay, I understand, yeah. Anyway, so top role for Smart says that $10 for Georgi from Bulgaria.
SPEAKER_01: You will give to him later, I'm joking, greetings for Georgi. Yeah. Whenever you talk about Dave, I said, like, what are his weapons? And you said you also countered his inside power. Do you see such possibility? To stop him inside? No, no, him to go hook you.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, he cannot hook me, I'm pretty sure. Okay, who can hook you on this? Nobody in the world can hook me on the right hand. Nobody in the world can hook, yes. Who is harder to hook, you or Vitaly Laletin? Or Ernest Gasparini? Or Michael? Or Devin? Or Levan? I'm not sure, but... You like your chances better?
SPEAKER_00: Look, for this I cannot answer, but I think that nobody has ever hooked me on the right hand in all my entire career. I cannot remember such a thing. I have seen the others hooked by other competitors. I'm not talking about East-West, I'm talking about the past, you know. I understand, I understand. There is one guy.
SPEAKER_01: asking Engin, did jerseys and signed cars get shipped? You are in North America or outside of North America? Because outside of North America, I think they are all shipped. And North America, probably 80, 90% of them shipped. And I think today or tomorrow, everything will be all shipped out. Anyways, so you are saying that you are the best top roller.
SPEAKER_01: in the super heavyweight category. I think yes, if I'm in good shape and no injuries. Yeah. And another question. Who would be your toughest opponent right now? Like who are favored against you in your head? Like, do you think Levan would be favored against you?
SPEAKER_00: Levan will be difficult for me because he is very strong sideways. Michael is very difficult also for me. Maybe Kvikvinia.
SPEAKER_00: Kuikminia? Or because of this? Yes, maybe. I'm not sure. I have no idea. Baba, you just told me that Jerry couldn't beat you and they can't do that. But you are saying now Kuikminia can do that. Yeah, but I don't say that he will beat me. I say that it will be a difficult match for me because Gennady is a warrior. Gennady is crazy. He doesn't like to lose at all. Yeah, yeah. Big Heart, he's like...
SPEAKER_00: like a terminator on the table he okay who would win you or hermes i i think that you think in your head that using the i think that i will be top of him and after one match i will beat him but one day let's hope we will have a match yeah yeah yeah and you would want to rematch with alex kudashe at some point of course because in this match i was half of my power
SPEAKER_01: If it's possible, it will be here. The way that Kurdesha beat you, I know you were not ready. You were using antibiotics and there was a high level of inflammation. I was on 10 painkillers this day. I was sleeping.
SPEAKER_01: yeah infection in the body temperature but the way the way that he beat you that match is the almost the same exact way he beat you some years ago at the zloty tour i'm not saying that he would beat you again if you were healthy or not i have not seen anything about it but do you do you think that the way that kurdecha pulled that day is similar to the way that dave cheffy pulls like our outer side pressure you know with the pronation and out
SPEAKER_00: I think it's the same but with a little difference because I think that Alex has a stronger wrist than Dave. Alex has a stronger wrist? But when they pulled the majority of the matches, I think Dave took Alex's wrist. Yes, but now I think that he has a stronger wrist.
SPEAKER_00: And just to tell you about Zloty Tur, before the match with Alex, I had a five-minute match against UIF. We killed each other. Oh, you had a long match before that. 2017, UIF won a heavyweight, and on Zloty Tur, we killed each other. Five-minute match. I couldn't just put my hand on the table. Okay, I understand. So at some point, you guys need to pull again, you are saying? Yes, because...
SPEAKER_00: Everybody knows that I was, you know, it was not real. How about you versus Vitaly? It will be a good match, but I think that I will beat him. So you like that anyone who is trying to take your hand? I think that Vitaly has problems all his entire career against good top rowers. You saw his match with Termas. Yeah. Do you think that he may be getting...
SPEAKER_01: bigger, stronger with time compared to the time that he played against Hermes? I think yes, but all of us are improving, Kenkin. All of us. But don't you think that because of his structure, his potential, maybe like a little bit more, like we're talking about over two-meter guy with really... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure, Engin. I think that size is not always what matters at all, you know. Vitaly Laletin is not like a regular guy that, you know, we say, oh, look at this guy, a big guy or something. When you are talking about, yeah, but I understand. I understand what you're saying. Engin, Vitaly, when he was competing, he was 100 kilograms. He was not heavyweight.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he was even 90 kilos in 2011. His natural weight is 100 kilograms. No, no, no. Listen, just because he was that skinny, it doesn't mean that that's how heavy he should be. I think that he has structure. I mean, Levan was small as well, but he became up to 190 kilo guy, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but he was competing in WAF heavyweight. No, no, no. I mean, in his earlier career, he was 110 kilos at the WAF. And I think in the Georgian events, he has been like 90 kilos or something. Yeah, yeah. 100 kilos. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. Did you know that Vasily...
SPEAKER_00: I mean, 2018 was last year for Levan and Vitaly. Vitaly was 110 kg. All of us, me, Rezo, Arif, Levan, we were heavyweights. I think you and Arif had a very long match.
SPEAKER_01: And Levan and Rezo had a very long match. Yes. I beat all of the others and Levan beat me in the final. It was the match. Yeah. Anyway, so that is for everyone who knows armwrestling. This is a very exciting thing. Very exciting. And there is another Superchat.
SPEAKER_00: Emilian Marius. Hello from Romania. See you in summer, Georgi. See you in summer, my friend. He's a friend of mine. He's a friend of yours? I'm his idol and he will come with his girlfriend to train with me and my boys. He's from Romania. That's good. That's good. Yeah, that's very nice. And what did you think about Morozov versus Vitaly?
SPEAKER_00: it was a very good match and uh it was bad that morozov got injured you know yeah yeah but it was very good match very good match i i was pretty sure that morozov will win this match but you know sometimes injury happens that happens you know yeah yeah yeah and how is your left arm doing
SPEAKER_01: I think it's pretty good, pretty good. Do you train? Do you even train? Not like right, but I train to pump, to feel it. But I think it's very good. Let me ask you something. When you were really, really healthy, earlier career, let's just say middle of the 2010s, you know, like which arm you think was better, right or left or same? I think right was better again, but left was very close, very close to it. Uh-huh.
SPEAKER_01: But right now it's a little bit more distance? 20% maybe. 20%. But if you just had three months later a left arm match, and if you just slow down with the right arm and go with the left, that 20% would go down to 10%? I think that it will improve much, yeah. I am sure about that. Okay, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: and and um you said that michael would be a very tough match for you yes okay the question do you plan or are you already training your shoulder press i'm training it and you're saying it can can you do it or i'm doing it it's not easy but i will make this weapon in my arsenal yeah you know because that is the part that is missing yeah exactly that's the part because your hand control and everything is just very very good maybe
SPEAKER_01: a little bit more size and this, and then you will be like perfectly, you know. Engin, you are right because I know that these are weak parts of me and I want to improve them. Yeah. And when you said that
SPEAKER_01: like michael would be difficult match it is mainly because of this right if you have very efficient shoulder pressure it would be you would it would increase your chance right i i i will top you him very easy but to finish him it will be hard without press you know but also you have very good endurance he would be very good yeah yes and and then from here i want to go uh another question
SPEAKER_01: Because of the same exact reason, do you think that Vitaly may have a problem with Michael? See, this is exactly what I'm thinking. I'm not saying that Vitaly cannot beat him. But I'm just saying that if somehow that match stops... Vitaly is over. It's over, right? Vitaly is not so powerful like Kermes and he doesn't have this press.
SPEAKER_00: He has one arm and one fast start. But if Michael stops him, believe me, very big problems for Vitaly. Yeah, this is exactly what I'm thinking. I'm not saying if Michael can stop him or not stop him. There is a possibility he's going to flash spin him. But just somehow the match stops here.
SPEAKER_01: Like, does Vitaly have that pressure that Hermes has? No, no. I mean, my opinion, no, as well. I don't think he has it. But maybe he can top-roll so good and then he can get everything here, here, here, here. And then maybe he wouldn't need it, but I don't know. Believe me, it will be a very difficult match for Vitaly.
SPEAKER_01: Michael is very difficult to beat. Do you agree with Vitaly when he said that Michael is more difficult for him than Devon is? Yes. You agree? Yes. I understand. What is the possibility for Vitaly to beat both Michael and Devon and pull the winner of the Hermes and Lewandowski?
SPEAKER_00: I don't think that Vitaly can beat Devon and I don't think that he will beat Michael. Oh, so you are saying that Lalletin is going to lose both matches? I think that Devon will destroy him. Oh. Look, Vitaly is dangerous because he's very tall, long arm and he's making very good grip here. But Devon is very smart, very clever and...
SPEAKER_00: he will not allow Vitaly to beat him on the grip, you know. And after that, I think Devon is way more powerful than Vitaly. You are saying that Laletin is going to lose against both guys? In my opinion, yes. Devon is becoming bigger and he is very dangerous, you know. He is also very tall, very clever and
SPEAKER_01: Way more experienced than the other guys. I understand. And how do you see Hermes versus Lewand? I think Lewand will beat him. Lewand is very strong. My opinion, yeah. And if you had a match with Lewand, what would your chance be?
SPEAKER_00: I think that I can stop him and beat him, but I have to be very, very, very good prepared for maybe five, six months only for him. To get that match, do you think that you have to beat some of the guys? Yeah, I have to beat maybe Hermes, maybe some of the top guys again to have this match.
SPEAKER_00: But I have played against Avant more than 10 times and I know my chances. I have all the time success to open his wrist, but I was not stronger in the side, you know. He's more powerful than before, but I think that I'm also more powerful than before in my past. I understand. I understand, yeah. Okay, let's talk about the Arlington event. Arlington event and
SPEAKER_01: Let's start with a legendary match. At least one of them is for sure legend. Yanis Amolins and Minda Agos is legend in making. So how do you see this match? And this is exactly your specialism, you know, like specialty, you know, like top row versus top row. I think that Yanis will beat him.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, you think Yanis will beat him? Yes. So the experience will win against... Experience and he is with way more better technique, you know. Yanis is better in technique than Mindaugas? Of course, he is one of the smartest guys on the table, for me. Ah, okay. And what do you think about the goat, Mindaugas? He is strong, but...
SPEAKER_00: in this match you don't you don't you don't like his style technique at the table no i i i know i like mint august but in my opinion uh he will lose this match wow that's interesting i i'm pretty sure about that believe me wow janice is very very dangerous and i think he will be very good prepared for this match
SPEAKER_01: because the top class and nobody who come unprepared no no for sure for sure because before mindagos was getting ready uh for daniel ustino you know from kazakhstan yeah yeah and he was gonna be 70 kilo match but then there was some visa issues and and then so
SPEAKER_01: We switched the match so he didn't have to lose more weight. And now they are going to put 77 kilos. And I asked to Yanis, are you in good shape? He said, yes, I'm in very good shape. And then he accepted. So if Yanis accepted the match, it means that he feels, you know, ready. In good shape, yes. Yeah, I agree. And so let's go. This one only percentage.
SPEAKER_01: No, no deep analyzing. Georgie versus Dave. 60-40 for Georgie. 60-40, okay. Yes. Okay. And then let's go. Do you know Valen Lowe? No, I don't know him. Okay, then let me not ask. Do you know Cody Wood? No, both of them, I don't know them. Okay, so...
SPEAKER_01: John Therin versus Craig Tuller. Do you know those guys? Yes, of course. I think that Craig will win. You think Craig will win? Yes. He's pretty strong and with good experience on the table. Very good experience. He competed in 1992. I know, I know. Yeah, think about it. I have seen him a long time ago.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I had one final with Craig in 2000. I didn't know that. Yeah, in Virginia, we had the final match in 2000, America, Virginia Beach, yeah. And let's go, Sarah versus Jocelyn. Jocelyn is from Canada. I know her.
SPEAKER_01: You know her? Yeah, she beat Sara last year, and now Sara wants revenge. And today, before you, she was my guest, and I asked her about her chances, and she said 100%. We will see. I think Sara will win this, and she will be very good prepared. I am sure about that. Okay, okay. And interestingly, she was lighter. Normally, she's around 85, 86 kilos. This time...
SPEAKER_01: This time she was 78 kilos. But she said that she didn't lose any power, any muscle, just maybe even some unnecessary weight. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Women, they don't have fat. They have unnecessary weight. Unnecessary weight. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Anyway, so let's go more.
SPEAKER_01: Matt Matt versus Kedergali Ongarbeev. Ongarbeev had a surgery last summer and this is his first match after the surgery. While you know how good Matt was against Marcio in the last King of the Table in Atlantic City. I think that Matt will beat him. He will top rope him and
SPEAKER_00: Matt will beat Ongarbe? Yes. Wow. Because after surgery, first match, I don't know what will be the shape of Khidir Ghali, but I think Matt will beat him. He will be uncomfortable for Ongarbe. Yes. Very long hand, very good top row. You know, what is the thing that I remember...
SPEAKER_01: Hermes and Ongar were pulling in Croatia. And Hermes beat him. And Hermes at that time was around like 100 kilos or something. And Hermes beat Ongar by fighting right and left. And later, Hermes pulled against Matt at WL. And Matt beat Hermes at that time. Matt, this weight is very strong and very difficult.
SPEAKER_00: He's total, he's explosive, and he's crazy on the table. He's one of my favorite tours. Oh, really? Yeah. He doesn't give a shit about anybody. You probably like those F-words, huh? To hear them. He's very, very, very powerful. Yeah, yeah. But Ongarbe also got stronger since that time, you know. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. But in my opinion, Nato will be a big problem for him.
SPEAKER_00: okay and prudnik versus cody merits this is close match for me either it goes fast by cody to the pin pad or it will be not a fast match it will be oh really i i don't think i don't see uh again to cook him oh really wow so they will go like this
SPEAKER_00: It will be a war, you will see. That's interesting. Cody is a very big guy and strong and he won't love the world left-handed. Yeah, then he lost the medal. Yeah, yeah. And, Cody versus Devon.
SPEAKER_01: left out i think devon will win do you expect uh easy win or the early rounds will be more not easy but he will win the first one or two rounds it will be a war but after that devon is more can i ask you a question when you pull against uh devon in dubai and some rounds you were right here you know and he was a little bit like if you had
SPEAKER_01: Very strong shoulder pressure. You think you could pin him? Yes. But this was not only the problem. His head was very wet and my grip was slipping all the way down. Okay, the question is, you told me that he put his sweat on his head. All the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And okay, if this didn't happen, would you beat him?
SPEAKER_01: not being him but one or two rounds i could take uh-huh okay so the match would be more like four two yes yes yes earlier rounds you are talking about yeah yeah i understand so if corey has very good shoulder pressure do you think it's possible him to have some rounds no now now devon is way bigger and i think that corey is not powerful in this uh
SPEAKER_01: in this position to pull without wrist no i said if he has it ah if if he has it it will be a problem for devon but yeah i remember i remember i mentioned this before corey and pablo was training after a monster factory match and corey
SPEAKER_01: went here and then paulo was going out and then corey pinned him easily with the dead risk and then and then i remember paulo and devon pulling and paulo was able to uh think one round press uh devon that way so what i'm just saying that corey has very good you know start
SPEAKER_01: If he can go all the way, not all the way, halfway, and then if Devon is just like open arm top row, like how he does, with right arm he has more. With left arm he is more outside. I don't know how much he trained. But if he goes here, and then if Corey puts his whole body pressure, you know, body weight, you know, on it, do you still think that he cannot have any rounds? Maybe he can. In this way he can take one round, but...
SPEAKER_00: Not three rounds, you are saying? No, no, no, no way. Ah, okay, I understand. Devon is very difficult to beat him. And now he's big, you see, he's growing up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In fact, you know, two rounds, like, Gennady was able to stop him. But he didn't, Gennady didn't have any chance to
SPEAKER_01: beat him. But he really stopped him. Yes, I know, but Devon was not moving. He was controlling all the match. Yeah, yeah. But about to finish him, there was problem. Yeah, yeah, but Gennady is very strong there, but Devon beat him, you know. Yeah, yeah. And let's go to the Gold's match.
SPEAKER_00: John Burzing versus Yoshinobu Kanai. This will be a crazy match for me. But I think John will take it. Really? Yes. Okay. Now do some technical breakdown. He will stop him, top roll him and slowly, slowly, slowly climbing, climbing, climbing. I think this will... Yes.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think that Kanae has better hand control than John. No, for sure not better hand control. But do you think that he may take the match to his side with the Coronators? I think that John will do... He will top him. I'm sure about that. And he will climb, climb, climb...
SPEAKER_01: my opinion i understand he's gonna climb up and then yes yes do you think it's possible him to finish uh can i without press yes i think even without because because todd todd had all the problems you know to finish you know
SPEAKER_01: And Todd, for a second, he even tried to do shoulder pressure, and he was like, what am I doing, you know? Yeah, but for me, John has better hand control than Todd and, I don't know. In my eyes... No, no, he has better, for sure, for sure better. Have you ever seen Kanai and John in 2010s, their matches? Usually John finishing him with the shoulder pressure. No.
SPEAKER_00: this is what i'm saying that john knows him and he will do what is needed to beat him you know and what if it goes to the endurance game i think again john will beat him in my opinion john is john is the gold you know he no no i know i know for sure also but
SPEAKER_01: John is not at his 40 or something. I know, but he will be prepared, believe me. It's in the United States. So you are saying that it will have a different meaning. Yeah. I understand. So when are we going to see you, number one? Have we ever? This is my purpose. Have we ever?
SPEAKER_00: He's singing and slowly I'm becoming to transform myself into a monster and you see me. And you are saying that you're going to beat Dave 60%. Yes. If that happens, who do you think that you should pull? I want to pull Gennady also. Oh, Gennady? Yes. This is a dream match for me also. Gennady, he's one of the greatest in heavyweight class. Powerful, strong, fast.
SPEAKER_01: How about if I said you with Michael, will you accept? Of course. Of course, yeah. Of course I will say yes. Probably only not to Devon. To Devon I will say again yes. Devon, I'm not afraid of these guys, you know. You know that if you want to fulfill your dream,
SPEAKER_00: you need to beat these guys, sooner or later. You can't say that sooner or later. I mean, you can't say that, no, not these guys. No, I can't say no. I have to say yes to all of them, you know. Okay, okay. But you just want to be ready and at the right time. Yes, yes. Because, you know, you need to prepare. You play against the best in this sport and you need time to prepare, to make a strategy, you know. Yeah. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_01: Is there any match that you want to watch? Which match do you want to watch? Just tell me, Engin, these three matches other than you competing. Just, Engin, set me these matches that I want to see. What are they? I want to see Stuyanto footballing.
SPEAKER_00: Stojan Polin, wow. This could be a good match. That's a good one, yeah. I'm pretty sure that Stojan will top-roll him. To finish him, I'm not sure, but it will be a crazy match. Another match, I want to see Alijan against Vitaly. And who's winning that one? I think Alijan will beat him. Really? Yes. But which way?
SPEAKER_00: in hook they will go in strap and alijan will hook him i'm wow morozov didn't even try that yeah but uh morozov is not such a hooker like alijan different styles and one more match listen listen when you say the different styles like morozo beat kurdecha by you know
SPEAKER_01: hooking him you know and without okay another thing i want to ask were you surprised when daddy can beat uh kurdecha i was a little surprised because kurdecha is way bigger but i knew that daddy can is very dangerous and very strong and how dangerous do you think that again is if he is not injured because he was making 105 kilo looks like he was losing almost 15 kilo and he was getting really like
SPEAKER_01: And now in 115 kilos, I think he was under 17. Before he told me he was under 22 or something. And so how good is this guy? Do you know what he told me? He said that he would like to pull Laletin for the world's number one. I think he will beat him. Oh, you think Dadikian will beat Vitaly? Listen, if you start Vitaly, he...
SPEAKER_01: Vitaly has one arm and one fast goal. If you stop him... Georgi, according to you, you beat Vitaly, Michael beat Vitaly, Ali Can beat Vitaly, and then one second, then Dari Can beat Vitaly. You know, I soon will think that Vitaly is just... I mean, you saw Vitaly versus...
SPEAKER_00: This is, I don't know, Vitaly versus Raita Morozov. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you are thinking that once somebody stops him, you are saying he's over. Believe me, making a match between Michael and Vitaly, it will be a nightmare for Vitaly. Also, Devon, make the match, you will see what will happen. It will be an impossible match for Vitaly. So, okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think that if Michael beats Vitaly, do you think I should still set Vitaly with Devin? Of course, it will be a good match. No, I understand. But if he is losing against someone who is ranked lower than Devin, maybe at some point we should. But I think that if he loses against Michael, then we need to see him against some other guys. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: in this in this way of thoughts yes you are right here okay how about how about vitale versus kurdesha right hand right and left left vitale will beat him right i'm not sure wow vital is way stronger on the left arm the right arm he is not so strong like in my opinion wow
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to make sure Vitaly will watch everything you say. I'm going to make a clip. I'm going to make a clip. Like, oh, Michael will beat Lalegin. Devon will destroy him. Ali Can will beat him. This will beat him. And I will make a clip. Make sure that Vitaly will watch that. He will be very angry at me. That's good. That's good. That's a future supermatch, you know. I don't.
SPEAKER_01: I don't like Vitaly. No, no, no. I know. Vitaly is a very good guy. I mean that this will be very difficult, tough opponents for him. You are saying that Vitaly is a very good guy, but he's just weak, you are saying. I'm joking, joking. I don't know about that. He says that
SPEAKER_00: Both Michael and Devon matches will be only a warm-up for him, training before Devon match, he says. I'm not sure. Yeah. And Michael is big. You saw what match they did with Hermes. Yeah, yeah. It was very close match, Hermes, to lose. If the match was one, two minutes longer, I don't see Hermes to beat him. Hmm. Hermes was starting to lose his wrist. Barely to...
SPEAKER_01: it was very close match yes yes yes yes it was here yeah we will see we will see anyway so we are here for almost 50 minutes and this was a solo one only you and i thank you very very much george this is great to see you and thank you for inviting me to make this uh nice podcast to talk what's that

I know that you wouldn't get offended, you know. Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. And yeah, anything else you want to say to your fans or anyone or to Vitaly, you know,
