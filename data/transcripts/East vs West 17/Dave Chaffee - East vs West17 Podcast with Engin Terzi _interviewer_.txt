SPEAKER_00: I'm pretty good. Can't complain. How are you doing? Good, good. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Dave, was it a strategy before you pull against the last WAC champion from Hungary at the King of the Table 13? You said that your neck feels better or something. Did you say that you were healthier at that time?
SPEAKER_02: yeah i mean my neck is always going to be you know sort of messed up probably until i get surgery someday but the but the pain's been minimal so i've been able to train hard you know like it happened in the past and also my elbow which had given me issues the last couple years um
SPEAKER_00: was pain-free and it still is uh right now so it's been that's what i was gonna ask how is it since then because if you felt good at that time and since that time to do uh dollar seven arlington event there is three and a half months more and like since then you feel better still feel better
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I definitely physically wise. I do. I feel better that way. It's been, there've been a couple of setbacks just with like, I got sick a couple of times, you know, I got, I got the flu and the cold and the virus, but other than that, those are just minor, minor setbacks, my body. Otherwise, like I said, my elbow feels healthy, so I can, I can do a lot, a lot of the side pressure exercises I used to do, uh, with a lot more weight, more weight now, which is what matters. Yeah. That's what matters. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So, yeah, I'm getting well prepared for this one. Okay, okay. Because a lot of people thought that, you know, Georgi Shvetko is the favorite. So, I would agree with them only if you, again, had a huge pain, you know. But you said that you were feeling better.
SPEAKER_00: during the Atlantic City event. And since then, except some minor illnesses or something, you said that your neck and elbow is better and you can train as you used to. So it means that we will be witnessing a big war.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I believe so. I believe, of course, Georgie, he will be the favorite the way he's pulled the last couple of years and some of the things, you know, have gone down during my matches. So I definitely agree that he's definitely the favorite in this match. But I'm coming in prepared. This isn't the Dave you've seen the last couple of years that's been injured and just trying to get through to get to the next match, you know, trying to get through workouts with pain and this and that.
SPEAKER_02: um i'm able to go out my garage and hit it really hard and and make gains on on my workouts so it's definitely physically and mentally it's huge to go out there and and to be able to make gains like that so for sure i'll be ready yeah yeah but but like in the condition that you are in now like you still think he's favorites
SPEAKER_02: i i gotta give him the favor he's just the way he's he's uh pulled the last couple years the the guys he's been except for the match he he went into and he pulled alex with like a broken foot or something like that i don't think that counts other other than that he's pulled great and he's he's in the top 10 i'm not so you have to give him the nod as the the favorite and i'm the underdog and i'm going in with some fire because i want to be in the top 10 again
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Michael was out of the top 10 when he beat Gennady as well. Are you just trying to put the pressure away from yourself by saying that he is the favourite inside of you? I don't believe that you feel that way, like he has more chance. I mean, maybe on the paper, maybe you are trying to be objective, but I don't believe that that's how you feel.
SPEAKER_02: Well, you got to go in. I try to be a humble guy going in. I'm going to be confident, though. I feel good. I'm going to show up 100% prepared and ready. And like we said on paper, he's the favorite. I didn't say that. I said he would be if you were not healthy. But that's the first question I ask you. How do you feel? You said you feel good.
SPEAKER_00: Now the things change. Now I see exactly 50-50 match here. I feel good. I feel healthy. If everything goes well the next month, you're going to see a huge war in Arlington. And it's going to be one hell of a match. I'm really looking forward to Paul Jordan. Yeah. Do you know how I see it? Your starts and you passing the center, you are one of the strongest players.
SPEAKER_00: I have ever seen. You know, like ready, go, and then pass in the center with your side pressure. You are incredible. And the way I see, like I have seen his match with Frank Lamparelli at the WAF 2022, like Frank went the same way, this way, and they had some battle there, you know? And other than that, like if you had only that side pressure, like if I have never seen your shoulder pressure against Vitaly Laletin and against Frank Lamparelli,
SPEAKER_00: I would just still give him 55-45. But now we know that once you are in a winning position, you have very deadly shoulder pressure. And now when I take in the center, you are one of the best ever. And the shoulder pressure, you are very strong. And he also has very strong hand control. So I see a battle there. How do you see from your perspective?
SPEAKER_02: That's the key. That's going to be the key right there. You're absolutely right. He's got that huge hand pressure. He's so strong. To try to get him to where I got to be on my side of the table is going to be key. And I'm going to try to keep my wrist, obviously. That's going to be very important. But if not, I can still pull with a flat wrist and, you know, with a flop wrist, depending if I have to.
SPEAKER_02: I've been working on different positions. If I do end up where I don't want to be, it's a good possibility because he's hard to get where you want him to be. He really is. He's hard to turn in, he's got that strong hand. But if I can get to where I want to be, I believe the match will be mine. But even if I don't get there, there's other things I can do that my backup plan I think will still work.
SPEAKER_00: yeah but but do you you agree that you have stronger side pressure than here i mean your side pressure is stronger well i've never pulled i mean he is very good with the wrist and rotation yeah you the way that you move sideways it is stronger like the question the match starts referee says ready go first round do you see yourself going this way or you're winning sides
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm hoping I'm going, I can take him, you know, to my side with some side, hopefully. But like I said, he's got that strong, that strong hand and back. So, you know, my wrist might end up like this, but I can still, I can still pull that way. So, I don't know. It's going to be, it's going to be very interesting. Have you been studying him, you know? Oh, absolutely. I watch videos of him all the time. What did you think about him versus Sergei Kalinishenko in Dubai when Sergei was, like, did you think that, like, if you were in the same position, you would press him?
SPEAKER_02: Absolutely. I watched the match, and there's certain little angles I can take. I think that that might be a little better. But I got to get there, and we're going to see. He's just so strong, and I give him all the credit in the world. I just got to get there, and I'm really looking forward to seeing where this match is going to go, because it could go either way. It really can. I mean, you guys are both the nicest guys at the table.
SPEAKER_02: toxic level is zero yeah well uh we're definitely the nicest guys at the table we're both we both want this match huge it's going to be we'll both be fired up no doubt so yeah nice guys will probably be thrown aside just for a little bit obviously we'll be respectful always that we always are but uh there'll be a lot of fire at the table yes yes i mean after the goal comes that's nothing toxic you know
SPEAKER_00: But if you beat him, I think you are making Morozov out of the top 10.
SPEAKER_02: I guess we'll, we'll have to see the people, the people will be like, I guess I get people something to talk to since the mores off beat me three, two, the last time. It was close. Yeah. I went up to nothing. It was the endurance that, that pretty much got me in that match, which obviously that's gets me in some matches, but, uh, let's, let's hope we are there to get that conversation. I mean, I'd love to, I'd love to work with myself back in the top 10 and then see what happens. We'll go from there, you know, one by one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean, it is like everyone knows you. You have proved yourself like who you are when you are healthy. That's the only question. If you realize that we say hi, hello, the third second I ask you about your health, you know, because that is all matters. Everyone knows that when Dave is healthy, Dave is very dangerous. And for sure, Georgie is not as explosive as...
SPEAKER_00: Vitaly Laletin. The one round that you went to strep with him, even the rounds that he beat you without strep, the one round you were able to, you know, like,
SPEAKER_02: go to step, you still were able to do that. And it didn't look like so hard, you know, it took like. I'm glad that Georgie's not very, he's not fast, which, you know, that stopped my cup of tea. I have trouble against guys that are really fast and get me to where I don't want to be. So that's definitely to my advantage that we're both not the fastest pullers in the world. So that's a good thing.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but almost 100% I'm sure that match is going to end up with a strap. Would you accept to go to strap if referee is asking both sides, you know, you want to go strap or you would prefer to pull? Yeah, if he wants to go to strap, I would. Why waste energy if you have to if we're going to end up there anyways, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. I mean, the reason I'm asking because, like, I mean, maybe one round â€“
SPEAKER_00: I understand, but that is something obvious, you know, just to make sure that the time is shorter for the event. Yeah, I'm definitely down with going to the Strap. If he's down with it, I'm 100% down with it. I got no problem with that whatsoever. The question, the last round, like when you lost against Laresin, the last round that you guys went to Strap...
SPEAKER_02: what was the difference that you won that round because right now you you were more like able to engage to win yeah i can engage his hand his hand is so big and like his grip is so strong i couldn't even get i could i couldn't even get to the straps if i tried with him it's just it's too hard when i and and i can basically i can kind of hold on to the straps and get where get where i want to be basically it's all there is to it yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, there are some people, they are suggesting, you know, the matches to start in strap. Like, I disagree with that because the original arm wrestling is without strap. There are a lot of things that you can do without strap and not in the strap. And so I think you need to gain that, you know, you need to deserve it, you know, to go there. Just if you remember the day that you pulled against the guy from Hungary,
SPEAKER_00: uh tobias and corey pulled and the all four rounds that if i'm not mistaken uh tobias won was without the strap and only two rounds went to seven corey was able to win uh quickly so what i'm just saying that the strap or no strap is can change the uh the results oh absolutely 100 definitely yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: So, yeah, so we shouldn't be forcing athletes to just like directly go in strep. And not every match is going in strep. Just strep application sometimes takes up to one minute. And a lot of matches ends without strep. Like when Levan beat Jerry, no round went to strep. I think Rustam versus Sandris, only one round went to strep. Matushenko, Alijan, no round went to strep.
SPEAKER_00: Like, like things like that. So you try to save time, but sometimes by applying direct step, you are also spending time that if the match is not going to go anyway. So, so basically you are saying that like you feel good and you are able to do the exercises that you hadn't been able to do. How much difference do you think it made? It's making. Oh, it's a huge difference because I can put pressure on my elbow now, like before.
SPEAKER_02: If I was doing any type of side pressure, it's just a sharp, horrible pain. I couldn't do anything. That's why you were overpronated to not have the pressure on the elbow. Okay. Yeah. So now I can get out on my table and my pulley, and I can put pressure right on my elbow, and it doesn't bother it right now, which is huge because I can gain strength and gain strength and gain strength. Whereas before, I couldn't do the exercises I wanted to do at the level I needed to do to gain strength, basically. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I understand, yeah. Anyway, so I think it's going to be a great match. Did you see the other matches as well?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I did. There's a lot of good matches for sure. Do you have any favorite one that you would like to... Yeah, I'm looking forward to Matt Mask and Angerbaev. That's a very interesting matchup right there. I love Matt. He's intense. But Angerbaev, they're both similar. It's going to be fun to watch that match. I'm 100% rooting for Matt. Hope he wins. I figure it's going to be a really, really, really good match to watch.
SPEAKER_00: For sure. Yeah, yeah. One is fire, one is ice. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exact opposite. Yeah, yeah. There is a super chat. I can't read the name. I think the letters are Arabic. Ask Dave Chaffee, please, which year he think is his prime form and strongest form. May that be the year that you beat Dennis, like one round? It was probably like 2013, 2014-ish.
SPEAKER_02: But also in 2017, I pulled Trubin that year and he was right around number one at the time. And I was really, really strong at that time. It was right before I hurt my neck because I hurt my neck in 2018 pretty bad. It was right before that. And yeah, so 2017 was one year and then like 2013, end of 2013, 2014.
SPEAKER_00: Are you sure that you need surgery? Is it like a nerve problem? Have you ever tried traction? Yeah, I've done traction at the car, but I have a machine at home that I use.
SPEAKER_02: It works a little bit, but after a while, it stopped working. I've got two or three shots in my neck over the years. The first one worked for a couple of years, second one worked for a year, the third one, it just stopped working. It's pain that just goes down the back of my shoulder blade basically. If I just move my neck just a little bit like that, it shoots down there. It's herniated. The MRI, I had a couple of MRIs over the last numerous years.
SPEAKER_00: I got herniated discs, bulging discs, bone spurs, stenosis. There's numerous things. Did you try dry needling? Did you try dry needling? No, I never tried that. Yeah. In 2012, I almost became paralyzed, my left side. Really? Yeah, yeah. My chest was gone, you know, only ribs left. Left was gone, shoulder. Arm was like a woman arm size. It was just like nothing, you know. And then with those, like,
SPEAKER_00: exercises and dry needling and the the traction and many things you know it's still hurting so much like i feel a little bit better but if i start training heavy especially standing and then it is killing me you know yeah
SPEAKER_02: That's what happened with the C6 and C7, I believe. It caused atrophy in my right pec, right tricep, and bicep. Some of it came back, but some of it never came back. It controls the muscle growth and stuff like that when it's damaged so bad. It just doesn't shoot the impulses or whatever that cause the damage, unfortunately.
SPEAKER_00: My left side was permanently one inch and it never came back. Like my left bicep, like this size was always bigger than this one, about one centimeter.
SPEAKER_00: now it's just one centimeter smaller since then you know even i train everything so it doesn't come you know yeah it doesn't matter what you do because it does it just at least same with mine it's so destroyed like i'm missing muscle right here muscle part of my part of my tricep and and the bicep so yeah it's unfortunate but just work through it so i i couldn't imagine how strong you would be with that that this pressure if tricep was 100 percent
SPEAKER_02: Listen, I don't want to think about it because I think about it every day. It's very disappointing and frustrating to me that what had happened. I mean, it's honestly, I'm happy as possible to do all the stuff that I've still done, you know, over the past, you know, six, seven, eight years after the injury. So, but yeah, believe me, it's always in my mind thinking if this shit wouldn't happen to my neck. Yeah, but it's the same for everyone, you know, like many things happen. I don't think there is any injury-free guy, but
SPEAKER_00: like there are some injuries only related like arm related or something but when it is neck related it is it is like totally different like sometimes when they do the traction you will not believe next day my arm is bigger not really big but like half something a half inch is bigger because it's coming the signal is more signal is coming and then like you feel your hands sometimes you don't feel your hand you feel like from your brain to your hand is just five kilometers you know
SPEAKER_00: But sometimes you feel, oh, yeah, it's coming, you know. The signal is coming from the neck, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, yeah, I really hope that, you know, it will be a great match between Gyorgy. Gyorgy is probably one of the best top rollers.
SPEAKER_00: He is. Yeah, yeah, he is. His wrist is very, very strong. And he's a very nice guy. Very nice guy. I think there will be a big battle, big battle. And how much do you think that the...
SPEAKER_02: Endurance will be important in this match. What do you think? Do you make plans for endurance? I always do. I know that's one of my weaknesses. I'm always working on my endurance. I seem to get tired. I like to pull in the straps, but my hand always gets blown up. So at practice, I try to pull every match in the straps just to get blood in there all the time. So I'm used to working through all the blood flow that's in my hand and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_00: and I'm definitely working on endurance I do the best I can to try to to get where I need to be but it's definitely probably it's always been one of my you know weaknesses yeah another question when we watched your match against Vitaly I was very very surprised with your shoulder pressure very surprised and have you trained
SPEAKER_02: had you trained before that match for that or just, you just had to do it and you, you tried first time in, in that match? Because I don't remember you doing that. I didn't train. I didn't, no, I didn't train for it at all. Like I just, I ended up there. I remember I'm just, I'm sitting there and I'm thinking I gotta try something different here because you know, we're both stuck. So I was like, all right, I'm gonna, I'm gonna creep up and try to try the shoulder press and, and it worked. Like I've always like, I've always like had a decently strong tricep. Like, you know, I do, I do,
SPEAKER_02: cable tricep work and stuff like that all the time but i've never actually you know i don't try i don't practice pressing because the elbow pressure it just bugs me and stuff like that so i don't i don't mess with it but i always have had a strong you know tricep press you know in in the gym basically so i figured hey what the hell give it a try and it worked so but but since then since then do that is it part of or has it been part of your game plan like do you do you train like
SPEAKER_02: right now at the table as well or i don't like i don't train my my like i said if i if i put too much i don't want to put too much pressure on my elbow because too much too much hurts and then then just setbacks take place and stuff like that i'll do i do i'll do practice it without any any pressure you know any way i do work on you know hits and stuff like that but not with weight
SPEAKER_00: So, so, okay. I understand. So you, you better keep it, uh, healthy and fresh. If you need it, you use it again, you know? Yeah. Cause I know if I, if I use it in a match, I'm going to be, I'm hurting for a, probably a month. So it hurts for a while. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and I think I saw a super shit, another one, both Royal day. What was it like pulling with Ali?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know which one he's talking about first or second, but generally you said that his hand was big and strong and other than that. Yeah, he's obviously got one of the most incredible grips in the entire world. Just ridiculous trying to,
SPEAKER_02: Trying to get to the straps with him is absurd. I mean, the first time pulling Vitaly was obviously the best match I've ever been in, just endurance-wise, going up 2-0, and then he won the next three, and then I ended up coming back and winning the last two to win 4-3. Just leaving it all on the table was like...
SPEAKER_02: absolutely incredible i had i had no energy you know i always tell people ask me how did how did you feel and i'm and i've said this numerous times my arms felt like my my at the time my eight-year-old son could have beat me an arm wrestling match because i couldn't feel it and i just just you reach down deep and then i came through and then the second match he was just
SPEAKER_02: He was way more prepared than me. He was just so strong and just, he ended up being, he ended up getting where he had to be basically to win. And he's obviously that's the next, the next guy in line or close to it to get a shot at Levant and he deserves it. He's a, he's a monster. Yeah. Did you, did you feel in danger of injuring yourself when you are trying to sleep for the step because of his, his grip?
SPEAKER_02: Well, in the first match, yeah, I did actually, I hurt my hand for a long time. He had, I tried something one time and I couldn't, my hand smashed down onto the table and my hand was literally for about six months. I don't know if I broke something or what. It wasn't right for a really long time. So yeah, he actually did. I forgot about, he messed up my hand for quite a while. Yeah. He does that to everyone, you know, like there's a big, big possibility that he's gonna like
SPEAKER_00: Break your finger. I think he injured Rafa's hand, you know, finger. I think broke it. I'm sure he did. He's just so strong. Yeah, yeah. There is another super chat. Rafa says, what dates are the two nights for the VIP tickets? I think this is for Friday evening and Saturday evening. So 28th and 29th, as far as I know. But you please ask the information on the website. Yeah. Hey.
SPEAKER_00: a while ago you you were you just raised your hand you were showing something i think i saw your forearm can you please do that look it looked to me big yeah yeah that's what i saw that's what i saw while you were talking yeah you did something like this and then i i was like i'm gonna ask that you know and then we're talking about something yeah it looks big it looks big yeah that feels good i'm not gonna lie i'm feeling pretty good right now so i've been preparing really hard like i feel good on the table so i'm i'm looking forward to this
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good. That's good. You know, like, listen, like, I mean, don't get me wrong.
SPEAKER_00: I don't care who is winning there. As an organizer, I am only hoping for a good match. I am also hoping that both athletes are healthy and coming there at their best. If they lose, they will lose because the other guy is better. In any case, the other guy is better, but you would wish both of them to come there at their best. Yes, 100%. I'm very happy to hear from you that you are feeling...
SPEAKER_00: healthy yeah what do you think about like a while ago we talked about Morozov and you and we also talked about Vitaly Laletin you pull against both guys but with the other hand they had a super match in Tbilisi
SPEAKER_02: What do you think about the match? I mean, to me, that was incredible. That was an awesome match. I was surprised at strength. I know I was, but I wasn't surprised at the strength of Vitalik because he's getting so much bigger and stronger. And same with Orzhov. Just looking at the size of him again, like how much bigger he gets every time he's on the table is unbelievable. Like they're just,
SPEAKER_02: two monsters and they put on a great show and it was just that whole that whole event was incredible with all the people and and the competitors it was it was it was awesome and you guys were doing you're doing something special for sure yeah Robert Robert the moment really helped a lot and and the moment that you know we kind of went with the strap and then uh Morozov stopped
SPEAKER_00: And he was like, Davai Vitaly, Davai, Davai. He was like, that Davai was not only to Vitaly because people had been putting some pressure on him. You understand? They were barking. And then he was just like, like, he was so happy that he didn't get flashed. And he saw that he was, and he got injured on, I think round one or round two. And he kept pulling and he was incredible. And.
SPEAKER_00: Would you expect Vitaly to beat Morozov with a dead wrist? That is the exact opposite thing I would expect. Never in a million years would I expect that. Me neither. It was very, very surprising. What happened to Morozov? I've seen he was in a cast or a race or something. What happened to him? It is not something broken.
SPEAKER_00: It's not like total torn, but like, how do you call, partial, you know? Okay. Yeah, I think he will be okay without surgery, and I'm happy. I love when people put their hearts, you know, there, you know, and huge respect, huge respect. Absolutely. Huge respect, both with Ali and him. Leave it all on the table, you know? Yes, yes. And everyone should respect, yeah. Yep. Zenzu is asking, hi, Engin, what are Dave's thoughts on...
SPEAKER_00: John versus Kanai. We will come there. We will come there and I'm just starting. And so let's talk about the upcoming event. Let's start with one of the best lightweight matches ever. Yanis Amorins versus Mindago Sarasaitis.
SPEAKER_02: man that's a that's a good one that's a tough one that's a winner for everybody seriously there's a winner for the crowd the fans um i don't even know where to go i mean yannis you know forever he's just incredible like he knows his stuff so well mandaga so i mean these last few years what he's done in the table was just insane yeah um so i i don't even know how to pick i gotta
SPEAKER_00: I'll go with Giannis, but I could go either way. I don't know. You go with Giannis because you want Giannis to win or you think Giannis is going to win?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I, I root for the old guys usually because I don't know if he's going to win. I root for him, but I've been dog. This is a nice, he's a super nice guy. How do you not root for him too? I personally, that's one of the matches that I would just pay a hundred dollars just to watch that match. Yeah. Yeah. Great one. Yeah. But some people, they don't understand. They just say, who are these guys?
SPEAKER_00: why you put a lightweight match. I mean, just,
SPEAKER_00: I mean, just look at McGregor versus Habib Maj. It's probably like one of the hottest, you know, combat, you know, competition, you know. This is a lightweight. They put on some of the best shows. Yes, yes. And also they are incredible. If you understand arm wrestling, you know that they both are this level technically. Absolutely. Yeah. Nicola is asking, Nicola Foster, prime Dennis versus prime Devin. Who wins, Dave?
SPEAKER_02: That's a tough one. 50-50? I would say it's probably 50-50. The Devon I've seen the other last week, 300-some pound Devon, looks really, really good. I mean, Prime Dennis back in the day, he was just a powerhouse. So, yeah, probably a coin flip. I don't know. But how do you think that Prime Dennis would do against Gennady last week? I think Prime Dennis would have poked him probably, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: okay so another question hunter knows versus what i know do you know what i know or from singapore honestly i don't i know i know of him i don't know a ton about him okay but of course you are supporting your fellow american puller definitely hunter all the way i've seen hunter pool recently he's he's beaten everybody around the last couple years so yeah hunter all the way yeah yeah anyway so
SPEAKER_00: Sarah Beckman versus Jocelyn. How do you pronounce her name, Jocelyn?
SPEAKER_02: think jocelyn i believe yeah yeah from canada last year i think she she beats sarah she's strong she's strong have you seen her forearm you know like really probably one of the biggest forearms you know enormous bigger than mine i think it's bigger than mine it's big but yeah she's a powerhouse sarah's got heart i know she wants she wants his rematch i know she wants to win um
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. I think Sarah's going to come back and take this one. I think she's got it. Yeah, yeah. I understand. And so let's go. Today, we announced a match. Did you see that one?
SPEAKER_02: cody and uh britney yeah i've seen it right before i came on the show yeah yeah left arm yeah yeah i didn't see that i gotta i gotta go with cody his i think cody's left is is top notch i mean he's really his left is really really good not that prudik is his right is better than his left i believe so i think i think uh cody wins this one three nothing oh two nothing okay yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: Another super chat. We want left arm match between Wagner and Zaur. Okay. Yeah, but it would be better if you guys say I want instead of we want because I don't know how many people represented here. So let's go to the next one. You just tell me like by the percentage of this one, you know.
SPEAKER_00: okay dave chaffee versus george swedco 50 50 50 50 okay now now we are talking okay in how many minutes in how many minutes we are here 32 minutes in about 30 minutes or more than 30 minutes
SPEAKER_00: you you come from georgie being favorite to 50 50. i forgot that was a long time ago i forgot he i forgot he was there we'll go 50 51 49 then no no you said 50 50. i mean you can you can only go to your side 51 you know not this time all right i got you okay yeah okay let's see in last 10 15 minutes it's gonna be 60 40 in your favor or not
SPEAKER_00: we'll see yeah and and then now let's go to devon versus cody left yeah listen do you like have any doubt that this match is gonna go strap
SPEAKER_02: No, it's going to go this draft. I think Devon's going to use his mind game. She's so smart. I think Corey, honestly, is a little stronger left-handed, but I think Devon wins this one. I do. Yeah. Do you see right from the beginning or there's a possibility early rounds to go to Corey? I think it's Devon. Do you know what I saw? One time I saw Corey training with Paolo.
SPEAKER_00: And then Paulo was like going to Corey Reese and Corey just pressed. Like with the ready goal, who is taking the center? Corey or Devin? I think Corey can take the center. Okay, do you see something similar in this match? Like similar to you versus Georgie Svetko? Georgie being Devin and, you know, Corey being you. And then going sideways and then...
SPEAKER_00: It could be similar. Devin might go semi-kings, move left possibly if he has to. Yeah, but if he goes like this, don't you think he will be more vulnerable if Corey is able to do that? Because the times that I see him losing was against Kamil. I have seen some friendly training with Paulo. Paulo was also able to do that. Do you think that there is a possibility if we are getting too open and someone with the size of Corey
SPEAKER_02: can be dangerous if you are trying to be open against him it's it's possible but camille compiles left-handed press is super strong he trains it all the time i don't think corey trains a left hand i could be wrong i don't know but i don't i've never seen him too often yeah yeah yeah i i don't know i never seen him but but whenever i saw him training with paulo
SPEAKER_00: like paulo one point took and then he was just like easily yeah you know paulo like it's possible but i don't know i don't know if corey's press is strong enough to you know to get to get devon if he goes maybe devil won't even need to use the king's move i don't know but his isn't as good left as it is right so i don't know it's hard to tell yeah i i some people think it is it is in uh like one-way match i don't see that way i i see that it's a very close match
SPEAKER_00: unless Corey gets out. I think fresh or fresh, I think that if the match is going, because Tobias is very strong guy. The rounds that he beat, Corey was without a step because Corey, sorry, Tobias is probably the second strongest grip.
SPEAKER_00: after lades in like his hand is incredibly strong so that is how he didn't let corey to go straight but there are two rounds that corey was able to sleep and those two rounds he dominated yeah he dominated you saw that right it was just yeah oh yeah i was right there oh i don't expect i don't expect um an easy match here i don't expect especially the first round
SPEAKER_00: no easy match if corey somehow wins first round like without getting so much exhausted second round he also has chance that can change everything yeah yeah but can you do that three times i don't know maybe he won't be able to do even first one but i don't see an easy match not at all yeah yeah and let's go here what did you think about michael versus uh ermeth match
SPEAKER_02: i that was that was the heart armies and i remember watching hermes years ago pull michael when hermes was only 200 pounds or 220 pounds and he yeah he knew he had the key to how to beat him back then he knew exactly what to do i mean he really did he i think he went up to nothing and then just got tired from what i remember it was it was a long time ago
SPEAKER_02: and I figured going into this time with Hermes being you know big armies whatever you weighed 280 300 pounds I don't know what he weighs now um knowing exactly what to do what you know how to beat Michael the right angles uh I kind of thought that there was a possibility that that's how it was going to go um rooting for Michael you know he had he was doing so great in his comeback um
SPEAKER_02: So I thought there was a shot that he would be able to power him. Yeah, he's so big right now. Dave, yeah. Even his wrist, like, his wrist was 10 inches. Like, he was huge, you know, really. He was very, very strong. And, like, if Hermes didn't know how to pull against Michael, he would have lost that match, you know? Absolutely, yeah. But, like, he did. Like, he knew, even years ago, knew what to do. And that's the key to beating that move is knowing what to do to the right angles, being patient. He was very patient during that match.
SPEAKER_00: And that was very important, but yeah, I was that was I kind of thought Hermes was the favorite going in and I thought it could have went that way. There is a super shed Tristan. Hermes or Levan, which is your favorite engine and Dave? He's asking us which one is favorites. I'm not gonna go there, but I mean, I don't think it will be.
SPEAKER_00: disrespect to Hermes because I had him as a guest not even a week ago and he said himself said that nobody is favored against Levan absolutely there's nobody there's nobody in the world that would be a favorite against Levan I mean he hasn't lost in how long there's there's
SPEAKER_02: there's no there's no way yeah doesn't mean you can't go in and he can go in and beat him it's absolutely you know somebody can definitely beat him but they're going to be the underdog going in for sure yeah yeah and and did you watch Hermes versus uh Levan live like like on pay-per-view or I had to work at that I didn't see it live I watched some of them afterwards yeah okay I watched live
SPEAKER_02: when the round that he stopped him and he put his shoulder and gave him trouble i was like like he can't be real you know he can't be yeah when i watched it the first time i was like i was like holy i was like wow that was incredible like yeah i got it got you fired up because like nobody stops him you know what i mean he did yeah yeah yeah yeah and and so
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about their meeting in June? And it will be in the US, most likely. With LeVon and Hermes? Do you expect the same thing happening as last time?
SPEAKER_02: I think LaVon's going to come in. Not that you can't come in more prepared. I think LaVon's going to be ready this time. Because I feel like if you've been on top for so long, there's certain times, certain matches you go in. Not that you're taking anybody lightly, because I'm sure that he doesn't. But you've been on top for so long, it's hard to be 100% motivated all the time. Yeah, but how about Hermes being young and also improving?
SPEAKER_02: absolutely yeah there's there's that too like he's still getting stronger and he's gonna go into new different things too that's why you know i'm looking forward to watching the match um i think i think levon like you said going the favorite i think levon will probably win but imagine if he does imagine if hermes gets gets that stop again and like holy cow it could change everything
SPEAKER_00: I don't think Hermes is going there to lose. I'm not saying he's not going to lose. But I don't think he's going there to lose. Yeah, he's going there to win. No doubt. Hermes is one of the, in my opinion, as a whole package, is one of the best arm wrestlers. He is. He's got a strong hand, strong inside. He's very smart. You're right. He has everything. He does. Yeah. And, yeah. So...
SPEAKER_00: So you are saying that Devon versus Corey, how do you see? 60-40 or how do you see? I think 70-30 Devon. 70-30 Devon, okay. And, yeah. So we have, let me see, if I ask all the matches except the one match that I'm going to,
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Craig Tuller versus John from Canada. That's a tough one, Craig. I love Craig. Another guy I'm 100% rooting for. Like I said, I always root for the old guys, but John Turing from Canada is tough. He's an up-and-comer, and I've seen him recently beat some really good guys, and that's going to be an awesome match. So you don't see an easy one, huh? No, absolutely not. It's going to be a war, and I think that's...
SPEAKER_00: I think it's, I think it's 55, 45 Craig. Oh, 55. So, okay. She's still favorite, but not super heavy. I think it's going to be a close. It's going to be a war. It's going to be a great match. Yeah, I agree. And Matt mask versus, uh, your favorite match. Last year he lost against Petrenko in, in, uh, Dubai. And after that he had an, uh, elbow surgery.
SPEAKER_00: And since then, he didn't pull. They removed a serious, like, big piece of bone. He sent me the photo of it. Yeah. And now this is his first comeback match. A lot of people think that if Ongar Bey was...
SPEAKER_00: Like, it was not his comeback match. If he didn't have elbow surgery, they think that he would be favorites. But right now, people are saying anything can happen in this match. And what did you think about Matt's performance against Marcio Barboza in Atlantis City? First, I'm going to agree with everybody. I think if...
SPEAKER_02: Anger Biaf didn't have that surgery and he was coming in. He would definitely be the favorite just from what he has done over his entire career, definitely. But it's going to be different. You don't know where he stands, basically. This is his first match back, so we're going to have to see. With Matt Mask, he dominated Marcio. That was right there for that one, too. It was impressive. He pretty much
SPEAKER_02: you know, beat him pretty much everywhere. He had to accept that. I think he let him go on the hook to last match, just messing around, but he had already won. But, uh, yeah, he just pretty much did whatever he wanted to and he looked really good doing it. It's so explosive and fun to watch. And yeah, that's one of my favorite pullers to watch on. So he's, he's, he's a good time. And how do you see the match?
SPEAKER_00: I'm going 60-40, Matt, just because we don't know where Angerbaev stands right now. First match back. Never easy, right? To make a comeback after the elbow surgery. Nope, definitely not. So I'm going with Matt Mask. I understand, yeah. And let's go to the match of the king. All-time king. John Brzee versus Yoshinobi Kanai.
SPEAKER_02: That's going to be interesting. Obviously, John, favorite. I'm going to say 70-30. Are you serious? I do. You know why I'm saying are you serious? It's because did you see the match between Yoshinobi and Tata Shins? Yeah, I did. But it wasn't a little King's Move stuff involved in there, right?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And you know, Todd, Todd doesn't have the shoulder pressure while John has the shoulder pressure. Yeah. John, John's smart. He can, he can beat anything anyway. He's amazing. One second. Todd, Dave says that you are not smart. I'm joking. No, no, no. For sure. John is smarter amongst us. Like smartest.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, for sure. I'm just saying, John is better apt to beat that move than Todd. You know what I mean? Todd beat it, obviously, and he's very good at what he does. But I think John will figure out a way to win. I think it's going to be a good match. Maybe we might wear him out, though. Who knows? John's, you know, no spring chicken. He's...
SPEAKER_00: she's you know 60 60 something like that yeah i think 60 or 61 but can i ask you something were you surprised when yoshinobi gave that match to that i was very surprised i mean i was expecting if todd can now finish it it will be a war yeah but man it was like a marathon you know like it didn't finish you know yeah
SPEAKER_02: No, it was great to watch. It was fun. I mean, I remember watching Yoshi, you know, about 10 plus years ago. But when I first started, he was around and he was really, he was one of the top guys back then. And I was pretty excited to see him come back. And yeah, he's fun to watch. I think that it'll be a similar match. It's going to go to, you know, the Kings and John will work his way through. And like you said, the King will win. Yeah, I understand.
SPEAKER_00: You have probably the utmost respect for John. Yes. Yes, right, yeah. Obviously, 100%, yeah. Do you think there is anyone who doesn't have the utmost respect for him?
SPEAKER_02: i would hope not if they do they don't know anything about arm wrestling you know what i mean it's just people that don't know about arm wrestling that deposit how did you not respect the guy who's done what he's done you know for the last you know how many years 40 years yeah 40 arm wrestling you know what i mean like everyone you know yeah
SPEAKER_00: be able to pull at this this level for that long for how long he's been doing it just think about that it's crazy and he's not a 60 years old how healthy man you know he's a 60 years old man that can you imagine all his matches with pushkar dennis siplenko richard lapkus clevedine get a good reach and yourself and other guys you know can you imagine that that 200 220 pounds 210 pound guy
SPEAKER_02: Can you imagine how much pressure he had here? Can you imagine the shoulder and elbow, how much pressure he had? Yeah, you don't think about that. Years and years of 200 pounds, 220, and you pull super heavyweights, and the top super heavyweights in the world, nonetheless. That's so much wear and tear on your body. You don't think about that every day. And to still be able to do that at 60 years old, it's crazy. Incredible, incredible. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean, yeah, some people don't understand, you know. Some people think that in the past, arm wrestlers were weak. They don't understand. Like, look at Kanai. After so many years, he just came and gave Tata Shins the toughest match. Yeah. Like, lately, look at Tata's matches, you know. And he gave a tough match. And Kanai was one of the guys from the past, you know. He just came and looked what he was able to do. So arm wrestling today is another level.
SPEAKER_00: But in the way that like deepness of the competition, like so many pullers, so many. In the past, there were not that many top pullers. But I cannot say that today's best is better than past best. Like imagine that like a guy 210 pounds today, just anyone, like...
SPEAKER_00: because beating like pullers like Dennis or Pushkar or, you know, Gary Goodrich or Cleve Dean or Richard Glavkis, like a guy from today, just bring, they would give his hand to a broken, you know, just say, okay, take it. Yeah. Yeah. And John did that for how many years? He went around the world beating those guys forever. Yeah. I calculated only after 1990, 1990.
SPEAKER_00: The years that John, as a 200, 210 pound guy, the years that he was the absolute best in the world is more than any other puller in history. At that weight, too. Maybe now Levan is closer. What's that? And to do it at that weight, it's incredible. Yeah, yeah. This is what I am saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was incredible. Yeah. Anyway, so yeah, there is, I think, one more question. Drip Snake.
SPEAKER_00: Engin, there is a chance we will see Ali Can versus Dadikian. Guys, you guys are going to see all kind of matches that you are dreaming about. But we can't do that all of them at once. So we will go event by event and we will make sure that you guys will enjoy. And that is the only goal we have.
SPEAKER_00: for you guys that that that's the only goal we want like we share the we share something common with you which is love and passion for arm wrestling and we know what you want and then we will do our best to bring all of these matches that you will enjoy to your attention and all we want is just you to support us and then hopefully all together we will go to the main event uh
SPEAKER_00: Sorry, mainstream sport level. Sorry for my English. Anyways, Dave, do you have any last message, anything to your opponent? It is probably very, very hard thing. The reason that we didn't have the podcast together with Georgi, his working times and days and yours, the time that you're available didn't fit well.
SPEAKER_00: working in a winter season you know skiing type of i think they have a store and he's really working hard when when it's winter time and any message even if he was here i don't think i could do much to steer the pot you guys you both are very nice
SPEAKER_02: I just want to thank you and East versus West for giving me the opportunity again to pull for you guys. Georgie, thank you for this match. I'm looking forward to this. It's going to be a war. I know you'll be ready, and I'll be ready. Safe travels, and I'll see you in a month. Looking forward to it.
SPEAKER_00: And he should be ready for a war, right? Yes, he should. Yeah, we can be that sweet. By the way, nobody gives you opportunity, my friend. That is what you deserve. You deserve more than this. And with time, hopefully, I mean, everything will be even better and better. Thank you very much, Dave, for your time. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. Take care and hello to your family, from my family. Dave, you too. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye.
