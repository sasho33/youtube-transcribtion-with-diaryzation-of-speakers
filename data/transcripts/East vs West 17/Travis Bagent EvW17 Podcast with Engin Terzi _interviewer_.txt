SPEAKER_01: is not in mood to uh compete here i know i also i also had you know experienced the same thing you know i i know how much it hurts yeah so yeah what can i say to the fans in tbdc i will just say them thank you
SPEAKER_01: What up, dude?
SPEAKER_00: You got your time jacked up? What do you mean? It's 4 o'clock here, not 3 o'clock. I was on at 3 o'clock. Yeah, it's just 3 o'clock there. No, it's 4 o'clock. Oh, you guys changed time change? Yeah, that's what it is. I don't know that. I don't leave that. I don't follow, you know, what's going on there. So I follow...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And yeah. So how is everything? You look like you're training. Yeah. Yeah. Are you? Yeah. I think you are. You are also. Maybe. Who knows what I might be doing. Okay. You are also, you look also reddish. Yeah. Turn the heat up. Turn the heat up a little bit.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, more likely it's blood pressure or you are in the winter. I worked in a football camp yesterday too outside and it was sunny. Maybe I got a little sun. Oh, okay. Okay, that's good. Yeah, yeah, probably that's it because your arms are so white. Yeah. Yeah. What's up with you? How's life? Life is good. I slowly train. Yesterday I did some bench and finger.
SPEAKER_00: Today I did some tricep. I plan to even start training twice a day, like one muscle group in the morning, one muscle group in the evening. In the past, I would combine three, four of them, train so hard, and then rest three days sometimes, you know. So now I can do today, if I do bench now, how is it going to affect my fingers, you know, so I can do finger later. But I would prefer to train them so that I won't be so...
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to get tired of it, you understand? Like I want a little bit, like 20, 30 minutes training and finishing. I don't want to do, I have done like trainings for like five hours, six hours, nonstop. I don't want to do this. I'm sure you didn't do those long trainings. No, no, but I used to do every single day something, but definitely more like you're doing now. But for me, when I did that, that's when I was working hard.
SPEAKER_00: training five or six hours. Yeah. Yeah. You don't seem to be that guy. You are, but whenever you were training, uh, your son and other group of people looks like you had like very strong discipline there. You understand? Yeah. But whenever it comes to arm wrestling, you're lazy. Yes. Okay.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah. Listen, I spent my whole childhood trying to get good at it. And I feel like I, you
SPEAKER_06: So that, you know, now, you know, you talking 25 years of caring about nothing else. So really when you turn 20, you already 10 years of stress already in it. So then the 15 years of actually doing it, to me, that was a long, that was a long time. So, you know, it was, you know, I think a lot of times people start at 20. So I just had a 10 year head start when it comes to the anxiety and wanting to win.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, there is a question for you. Travis, do you plan on getting back to training? I do. Yeah, I always leave that open. So I don't know if or when it'll happen, but I feel like that it needs to be like every day, regardless if I'm competing or not, rather than just all of a sudden waking up one day saying, OK, I'm going to start training. Well, you know, I already should have been doing it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. Do you know, do you know what you should do? I think I also should do the same thing. We should start just training without like any goal that in two months I need to be ready. That's the mistake we are doing. I think we should just start training, training, no pressure, no pressure. Especially for me too. There's so many times I could just arm wrestle because I've got great arm wrestlers just around there at the event. But for some reason, because
SPEAKER_00: I don't think I'm strong enough. I don't even mess with them. I need to arm wrestle a lot. Like a lot. Yeah. Andre has a good, good idea. He wrote, he says Kalina versus Travis left arm. Kalina. Yeah. I don't know. Is he, he, listen, is he good lefty?
SPEAKER_00: Pretty good, right? Listen, I think about seven, eight years ago, he broke his left humerus during the Zloty Turf. I think it was the final match. He broke his arm. Has he even arm wrestled since? Yeah, lately he's doing it. He said he's getting better. He's very good right now.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, so, I mean, he would beat the shit out of you, you know. Oh, I know, yeah. No, no, no. Left arm is different, you know, yeah. Yeah. Ooh, what do you think? Are you coming to Arlington or no? No. Who's coming? Anybody from your family? No. No, really? Yeah. Okay, so Robert's really pulling his weight. Let's go.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Robert Dexter, Anna is coming, you know, just everything will be good. Yeah. And I'm sure, I'm sure Bob Brown will help. Yeah. It's going to be awesome. I think, man, everyone, all of my people in Texas tell me that that place is amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How about doing one in Chicago? I know dude, I was on the phone all day today, man. Just possible.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, very possible. You know what the thing is, man? There's so much to do if you don't have everything right there. Like whenever you got to transport or you get too far away from the airport, like there's so many.
SPEAKER_00: matters so much when you're talking. Listen, again, Chicago's huge. Yeah, yeah. I used to live there, you know, right? Yeah, yeah, okay. So you get it, right? What was the big, big street? Western Boulevard? Was it Western? There is one big main street that's going all the way, you know, like it goes to, after a point it goes to the south, and then it says the north.
SPEAKER_06: western yeah i don't know but i i it's you understand now the like you could really get it not get in trouble but it could be overwhelming new york chicago los angeles and then if you don't pick the right location this rosemont area is so perfect that if this plan comes together
SPEAKER_06: You said that it's somewhere very near the airport, right? Yeah, less than a mile. Oh, are you serious? Half mile, half mile road, man. Wow. Yeah, it's crazy. You know there needs to be a tournament?
SPEAKER_06: also it would be incredible yeah i think i think we can do it yeah yeah it's listen if we can get this it's going to be it's going to be crazy it's going to be crazy so yeah no definitely i've been working on it all i had about seven phone calls this morning so everybody that's good that's good yeah we're gonna end of this week i'm gonna know if my friend my friend trust me east versus west is getting crazy
SPEAKER_00: We did one in Georgia, now most likely Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, like everywhere, you know, like everywhere. And they all provide very, very good conditions, you know, because of the organization level, you know, it's just incredible. Yeah. Anyway, so that's good. That's good. And how is your son doing? Everything is good?
SPEAKER_06: Everything's great. Yeah, everything's good. He's training in Miami this week with a bunch of other NFL guys. So he took his little brother with him. Yeah, they're both down there training in Miami. So yeah, they're pretty lucky guys. Pretty lucky. We're about another another year and a half from being. Yeah, really, really good. Yeah. Yeah. One guy is asking in Brazil, my friend, we are willing to organize this versus West.
SPEAKER_00: everywhere in the world as long as the conditions are good enough. We need to have a good reason to organise there. We can organise in Istanbul or somewhere else. We need to talk, there should be an offer, we can also tell our criteria and then we can do it. No problem, Brazil would be beautiful.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Travis, that's good. That's good. Another event is waiting. People are asking if you are going to commentate there. Yes, you will be. I will be in Arlington. Yes, I have got my ticket. And I am super excited, boy. This is going to be a good one. It's going to be a good one. And I don't have to fly 17 hours. So to me, this is epic. This is epic. 17 hours is for probably Tbilisi. For Istanbul...
SPEAKER_00: Probably it's like nine hours or something. Nine hours to Tbilisi, five hour layover, two hours from Tbilisi to Tbilisi. Nine hours to Istanbul and then layover and then Tbilisi. Okay. Yeah. But when the event is Istanbul, nine hours direct flight, you always said. Yeah. Easy work. Easy work. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That's how you tricked me. After one trip to Tbilisi, Istanbul's easy from now on. Yeah, that's why you needed the experience to appreciate Istanbul. Did you watch Alden and Artem? I didn't, but I heard about it. Yeah, that's good. Artem's strong. Artem got strong. Yeah, he did. Yeah. So it's good. People complain about you being
SPEAKER_06: too patriotic when you are commentating. Yeah, I am trying to be funny. Trust me, it's an interesting slope there taking that job so seriously that you're trying to become something else. Or I can be as funny and loud and try to bring something else to it.
SPEAKER_06: I definitely hope that people see the humor in it. So we'll see. I'm going to be real crazy in Texas. You will? Well, just the fact that that crowd's going to be heavy pro-USA. So that should be, as commentators and as people having something to do with the production, we should exploit that as much as possible, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah make it a real hostile territory yep i thought it was i thought the kablisi was like the best arm wrestling show i ever been to uh-huh yeah i i think i think yeah we will see we will see like like i think arlington is a venue and like i i think it will be very very good i i think that arlington will be
SPEAKER_06: the best way so far. That is my hope. It's going to be so interesting to see because, you know, the USA is spoiled, right? Spoiled rotten with things to do. There will be 14 things to do right there in that area where we're having our event. Super busy.
SPEAKER_06: america doesn't doesn't slow down on saturdays it is going to be very interesting if we get like what are you expecting a thousand two thousand however if we if we get a big crowd in arlington it really just solidifies the fact that dude we are headed in a unreal direction
SPEAKER_06: so i'm i'm interested because tablisi to me i mean i don't want to be the uh party pooper but to me it's going to be hard to replicate very hard and if and i and i sensed that everyone assumes that texas will be bigger and better and that's just the way it goes but it doesn't have to be like arm wrestling wise talent wise
SPEAKER_06: Arlington is a good card. That card in Tbilisi, come on, man. Come on, man. Everybody was a killer in Tbilisi, man. It was crazy. So if we can get by in Arlington with a card that is not quite like the last one. Visa problems are really limiting me.
SPEAKER_00: We were going to have a match between Jerry and Kami. And you know that Jerry lost his father recently. Yeah. Yeah. And like you can't really tell him, you know, like if he's feeling down, don't want to train or something. You can say, no, you need to compete. You can't do that because we are first human, you understand? Of course. We need to understand. And this is not really...
SPEAKER_00: like of course like there is like good interest as an armwrestler for his first but but it's not like it's not it's not jerry's job or something you understand i mean yeah but we we pay good but it's still not and i mean i'm telling you we are we are still not i i hope i will never be that professional to uh tell an athlete you know you need to pull your father die but you know i mean
SPEAKER_06: We would ask kindly and however he's feeling, he tells us, and we respect, you know. And it goes to show, too, how awesome it is that you can try to get him to pull. He can't make it for whatever reason. And the brand can move right on. And it's not a crushing blow, right? It sucks. It is what it is. But the brand is strong enough to move.
SPEAKER_00: forward. That's the best thing about it. And the card's awesome. I mean, this card is going to be awesome. We will talk. If the United States supports it live, like what I saw in Tbilisi, crazy. That would be awesome. Benji says, thoughts and prayers for Jerry and his family. Yes. Okay. Whenever I say that, like, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, this and that, like,
SPEAKER_00: these are not like we want to go and just directly have the event there we we have some conditions you understand so what i try to say is that east versus west is getting really big enough to uh have expectations and they are provided do you understand what i'm saying yeah so what what we are doing right now just any other
SPEAKER_00: like organization, I don't know, going there and would require what we are requiring, they will just laugh and say, no, you understand what I'm saying? So, yeah, so that is, that's everything is getting bigger, better. And yeah, and I think that Robert is the right person because I think it was kind of too much for me to handle everything by myself, you know. I'm really exhausted.
SPEAKER_06: When I first heard you say that, I didn't really believe you. But after 10 times of looking at your face and you saying, hey, listen, guy, like my whole life,
SPEAKER_06: I never had such a responsibility and it is unbelievably taxing. And I am looking forward to giving those responsibilities to someone else so that I can go back to my regular life a little bit. And I was like, yeah, whatever. He loves this shit. He ain't going to give it to anybody. I don't have power for that. Because now I thought it would be easier.
SPEAKER_00: But remember, there was before, like, I was doing one event, Dubai was doing another event. Now, we are doing every one and a half months instead of every three months. So, it is about, I'm about the same busy. And also, there is some transition. You understand? Some things like responsibilities from me is moving to Robert. So, it also takes some time, you know. It just doesn't start, you know, okay, you do it and then you need to do something.
SPEAKER_00: transition anyway so yeah I think I think the card listen I will just tell you something this what I wanted to say like the part that you are patriotic about your country you being funny or not it doesn't matter but the way like what I like about your commentating is that you understand from our mercy and you enjoy what you see and you value
SPEAKER_00: what you see because you know what it is. You understand? You know the level. Whenever you talk about, you are not a guy that understand only those top a few guys or something. From bottom to top, you breathe our medicine and you understand and I really like your perspective. You know? Yeah. Great job. Yeah, listen, there's no doubt that experience is huge.
SPEAKER_06: It's huge. So when you have experience and you kind of understand, and then, I mean, I can't believe how good the guys are. And I can't believe how hard it is to win. I cannot believe it. And it is real. So I told Artem a couple weeks ago, to me, now we have professional arm wrestlers, and there's only 50 of them.
SPEAKER_06: only 50 of them there's not there's not 500 of them there's 50 dudes 60 guys whatever it is and that's it and that level is huge man if you ever get invited there you're the luckiest person in the world right now yeah yeah i i i just can't wait you know i'm i'm you are probably
SPEAKER_00: The only person that I am very curious about your opinions. It doesn't mean that I will agree everything you say, but I'm very curious because you are unique. You are not fake. You are not being political, you know, like, like saying what people would like to hear or something. You just say whatever you want to say. Yeah. So let's start.
SPEAKER_06: Let's go from the top, from the top down. Start with John. No, start from... Come on, man. Let's start with Cody versus Joseph. I have no clue except a lot of guys that I have a lot of respect for really love Cody Wood and they're wishing that he does well, so...
SPEAKER_06: I say... You remember, right, Joseph? Of course. At the last thing on the table, he beat Kevin Palco? Yep. Yeah. I watched that match and didn't know... I was surprised. Yeah, and didn't really know how that match was going to happen either and was super impressed, strong. But, you know, I could see, like, Ron Bath is rooting for... Not rooting, but was very happy to see Cody getting a chance, so... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good luck for the young man. I'm going to go with Cody Wood. Good luck.
SPEAKER_00: I have seen him doing some crazy stuff with pull-up bar. But whenever I was looking at his results, I was like, wow, this guy is great with pull-up. For me, pull-up is very important. If you tell me you're going to arm wrestle and you will do only one exercise for arm wrestle, I will do chin-ups. Of course. Yeah, this is what I would do. And then whenever I see he can do all those crazy things, and then I was like, this guy should be better than this, you understand?
SPEAKER_00: And I realized that he was very new and more times. So he progressed, progressed because he had that potential and let's see how the match will go. He looks very competent. Carpenter Jim says, I love when Travis sings the national anthem. I love you guys. Thanks for the, thanks for the event. He says, yeah. And I really wanted, I really wanted Michael Todd to not, not really win, but just really.
SPEAKER_00: push, but Ehrmans was so efficient. I don't think it was an easy match. No, not at all. I think that Ehrmans did everything perfectly right. Perfect. He didn't make any mistake. Listen, if you make a mistake against the shape of Michael, you are in trouble. Yeah.
SPEAKER_06: That's why I started singing. I would have told you, like, oh, he doesn't re-grip. If he has that little problem, he's not going to be able to pin him. But, man, I tell you, Hermes is a bad dude, man. I need to be careful. I need to make sure that I make sure that I put some respect on that man's name. Travis, he's a very good arm master, right? Very good. Very good. You enjoy when you are watching, he knows what he is doing. Not like John Bersink, but.
SPEAKER_06: Like, right there, you know? Yeah. Pretty, pretty. Yeah. And also, too, like, so aggressive, too. Like, he's fun. He's fun. He's fun to watch. And he did a great job and super impressive because I'm telling you, Michael Todd is strong. Yes. I have never seen him like this. Have you ever seen him that big? Never. Never.
SPEAKER_06: Never. He was just like mountain, mountain. And so ridiculously committed to the acting like this is the most spiritual, aggravating, I am fucking ready attitude. And he did not deviate. Like, just seemed so unhappy.
SPEAKER_06: and so focused and so ready. And then right afterwards, he's back to just the nicest guy in the world. And we're talking. So he was really ready, man. It was close. It was close. And also, Ernest is awesome. It's amazing that all of those things can be true. I find it shocking when people are not taking Michael seriously.
SPEAKER_00: You are an arm wrestler as well, Travis. Don't you think that this guy's style is extremely dangerous and not many people can really find a way to beat him? For example, I know we are talking about something else, but can you say that
SPEAKER_00: Vitaly, like, in 100% beats Michael? I don't say that. Definitely not. No. Once the match stops, it will turn into a nightmare, you know? Vitaly has, yeah. I've never seen Vitaly. Listen, what Vitaly did was absolutely amazing. Yeah. People talk about the details. You're talking about the Morozov match. But did you know that round one, Morozov got injured? And then also round two. This is what Morozov said. Round one and round two, two times, you know,
SPEAKER_06: So whenever your elbow, you hear the, you know, and then when somebody is even going to your elbow like this, it's just kind of like, you have probably experienced that thing, right? Of course, yeah. Nothing scarier when that tick, tick, tick happens here in that honor ligament skipping over the whole thing. Listen, I got a lot of a small, I mean, it's amazing how you can lose some respect for these guys when you see them lose to other freaks.
SPEAKER_00: And then you can, you know, in your brain, you're like, oh, he ain't much. Listen, Morozov is amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like all of them, all of them. Even like, like when you talk about Michael and Hermes, Michael is here and Hermes was here, you know, like, it's not like one was here and the one was here or something. I've never seen Vitaly after go.
SPEAKER_06: balanced anymore he is off balance and is in a 100 hurry to finish the match what i saw with ermys where he stopped kept his posture shoulders over here played the game everything was perfect i've never seen vitale operate that i saw vitale beat um uh big guy lefty uh
SPEAKER_06: Comedy? Yes. And did it not technically.
SPEAKER_06: It was kind of panicky the way that he did it. You have to be careful with Michael Todd if you are going to immediately try to win and then get off balance and keep trying to win. It takes a little bit of surgery. So I think it's very valid that Vitaly and Michael Todd, anything could happen there. And Michael Todd could come out in that win, ain't no doubt about it. Now, don't get me wrong.
SPEAKER_06: Vitaly could win too. He could beat Michael Todd even if he didn't do it like Armys did it. He might do it. Okay, okay. But how do you think? He might just like Camille. He may panic. He may panic and have enough leverage to finish. He may because he is awesome. And it's funny too. I feel like we think less of Vitaly.
SPEAKER_06: because of what he just did, when really we should just be praising Morozov like, holy camoly. But Morozov, you saw Morozov how big he was, right? He was back. He's amazing. Did you see him jump in the air? He's got about a 69-inch vertical, like just straight up in the air, like a freak athlete. Yeah. A freak athlete. Yes, yes. Did you know that he was a wrestler?
SPEAKER_06: I didn't even know. I keep hearing about Datacon and about Morozov. Both of those guys having somewhat of a problem with the antics of one Devin Larry. And in my brain, you know, being unaware, misinformed, under-informed,
SPEAKER_06: I'm thinking to myself, because of Devin's tactical army military background, that he's not going to have a problem in any sort of physical altercation. And then I make that remark to some people like, shit, they better watch it. You know, ain't none of them going to whip Devin. And then everybody started telling me the resume.
SPEAKER_00: of these guys, and I'm like... Yeah, listen, we don't need to talk about who's doing it. Just bad dudes. We will never see those kind of things, you know, in arm wrestling. That is the last thing we would like to see, you know. Athletes, just complete athletes. Yes, yes, yes. And he put a lot of heart there, you know.
SPEAKER_06: Great. And honestly, too, like, I know that after the match, maybe towards the end, we found out there could have been some injury. And then after the match, we find out he was injured. But I kind of, in my brain, felt like Morozov should have concentrated a little bit more. Yes. Instead of doing all that show, right? Yeah. I told him the exact same thing.
SPEAKER_06: Relax there after round two, bro. It ain't over. You got it. You're sitting pretty. In my opinion, your boy looked gassed. Vitaly looked like he's not a cardiovascular hero. I don't know if it was gassed or he was hurt. I don't know about that. Yeah, just like it was that first round. The first two rounds was very hard. You're talking about Vitaly was gassed? Yes. Yeah, yeah. He was tired. He was working his ass off.
SPEAKER_00: Whenever I saw the round one, I said in the next round will be easier, but I didn't know that Morozov was hurt. Yeah, exactly. And to me, I'm like, man, you need to focus, keep the pressure on and you can win this thing. I thought the same way. He was doing show. He was jumping. He was screaming, even during the match. But listen, I will tell you something. If Morozov would have won that to say,
SPEAKER_00: four zero he wouldn't give the taste that whenever he stopped him like this and he was like it was just beautiful beautiful he was just yeah i loved it you know yeah i mean it was great that was a good match for both of them both of those guys soldiers they went ahead yeah let's see fatali fatali showed a lot of heart
SPEAKER_00: he was more focused focus he didn't do show he was focused on winning while morozo once he stopped vitale he was so happy because people really made so much fun with him and and now whenever he stopped he was not actually screaming to vitale he was screaming to everyone who has been making fun with him you understand yeah of course and no one gave him a chance too it was great it's
SPEAKER_06: Man, he's a bad dude. And also, too, it showed how absolutely amazing a couple other left-handed guys are because the people who pulled Morozov well but are lighter than him have to be very... I mean, Morozov did a very good thing for himself. Were you surprised about Dadikian and Kurdesha, left-hand? You know what? I...
SPEAKER_06: I was surprised before they locked up. But once, you know, what I noticed about, you know, and I don't want to speak bad about Alex at all, but he is the biggest guy, but he makes himself small.
SPEAKER_06: When the match starts, like, his squat and his foot placement and his posture and his, like, belly button being that far underneath the table at the start, it kind of cuts him off. And he's, you know, Datakon's so fast.
SPEAKER_00: to the spot. I mean, it was, that was impressive. And I thought that, I thought that Alex would be in trouble, but just be too big for Darikyan to pin three times. Do you know what happened? Darikyan said, Engin, I'm going to be 130 kilo and I'm going to pull Vitaly left arm. And listen, if he really come, have you seen his arms closely? Yeah, he's the meanest looking guy in the business.
SPEAKER_00: he looks like you know he has two legs you know like you know swinging at this side you know and this guy imagine being 130 kilo i don't know if he can do that or not but listen anyone thinks that because he lost to uh prudnik when he made 105.
SPEAKER_00: anyone thinks that because he lost against Britney, he cannot beat Vitaly. Trust me. We talking about two different things. This guy has very strong hand and wrist. Very strong. Yeah. And I won't be surprised if he becomes number one. What's that? That's going to be interesting for both of them. Cause that thing's going to be one right as they set up there and that set grip to see, because I mean,
SPEAKER_06: was in on he was in on alex like i mean he's got that skill just like matashenko i mean you're going in a hook it's like you even you got to give up some to maybe get it out but all things fair they're just i mean i'd like to see them two go at it yeah do you know what i would like to see 115 kilo
SPEAKER_06: Darikyan versus Devin left arm. Oh man, that's great. Are you kidding me? That's the stuff that gets the North Americans crazy. Like we want to see Devin.
SPEAKER_06: is so amazing right now at this level of competition being able to mess around in multiple weight classes is unbelievable and we want to see him win or lose though the world wants it so i'm all over that i would love to see that okay let's go let's go hunter versus wild and load
SPEAKER_06: I don't know Valen Lowe well enough, but I am a huge, like, I think that, you know, I've talked about it before. North America, we need guys, right? The U.S., we really need a guy. And we got two guys. We got two guys on this card, in my opinion. And Hunter's one of them. Cody Wooden? Hunter and Cody? No. And, come on, Shark.
SPEAKER_06: Oh, Sharkovich. Yeah. Yeah. To me, Sharkovich is good too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, even with his name being a Russian and his descent right now, he represented the great USA and listen, he's pretty good. Now there, you can be real good and not be able to make that step up. Don't get me wrong, but he is pretty good, you know, and he can, and Hunter, I mean, listen. He has that, that, that, that, that,
SPEAKER_00: fire that electric to become a superstar. A hundred percent. And what a beauty, like what a time for him.
SPEAKER_06: Like if you really could put yourself on the map as a legitimate title contender and you live in the United States, you're in a, listen, that's good company. That is good company right now. And I am rooting for Hunter Nolte. Did you know, did you know, did you know that I also sit in my left arm match? Yeah. Which is very interesting too. Cause what's, what is Mindaugas' left hand capabilities?
SPEAKER_00: He has won Waffles. Really? Yeah, he has some wins against Daniel Prokopchuk in the past. Oh! But listen, it was just eight, nine years ago. Not any time near. After that old time, Daniel won. Yeah. Because I just have this vision in my mind of Hunter winning.
SPEAKER_06: against i think it was was it justin bishop just a couple months ago i think it was justin bishop i think with lifetime yeah yeah it was close it was close yeah yeah but listen justin has a very good left arm as well there's no doubt about it i agree but when you tell me that when you mention daniel's name in any capacity and tell me that mandalgas has that sort of range
SPEAKER_06: as well, that's scary, I think. That's scary. That's scary. But, you know, Mendaugas, to me, is a superstar. So, once again, tremendous advantage for Hunter. He's going to get some great experience win or lose left-handed. What he really needs to do is show off right-handed so that we have, so that we all get behind him as you, you know, start feeding him up the food chain.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, while we're talking about Mindagas, how about Mindagas versus Yanis?
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, I think this is just the whole Todd Hutchings, John Brzezink thing where, you know, a lot of their life, it was John Brzezink over Toddzilla. A lot of Giannis and Mandaugas' life, I feel like, if you talk to... They didn't pull for like last five, six years or something. Right, but their whole youth, you know, coming up, I think Mandaugas acted like Giannis was a hero...
SPEAKER_06: mentor type of guy that he wanted to be. But I do think now, as Todd Zilla has surpassed John Brzezink, maybe currently, I think that we're going to see the same. Do you think that Todd Zilla passed John or John
SPEAKER_06: Of course. Yeah, yeah. There's definitely John coming down and Todd coming up. So just know that they're beating each other as they're coming down. And Todd's scary, dude, man. Todd's scary. Like, Todd looked at me right in the face and said, Travis, I might be getting better. I think he is. Yeah.
SPEAKER_06: Come on, man. So you are saying that Mindaugas is going to beat Giannis? I think Mindaugas is going to beat Giannis as, you know, I think he's going to do it pretty. And listen, also, I don't know how tight they are as to what Mindaugas will do when he is up 2-0.
SPEAKER_06: Does he drill him the third round or do they start putting on a show? And I hope I'm wrong because I love Giannis and I would love to see, but when I see how close Giannis and Justin was, and then I think about what I think that- One second, one second, one second. If you go there, I need to tell you something. Did you know that Justin and Mindagos also played the East West? Yes. It was 3-2.
SPEAKER_00: No doubt, no doubt. In my opinion, Mendoza has leveled up since then. No, no, but people say that when Giannis pulled Justin, this is what Paul also said, Justin was stronger than Justin who pulled against Mendoza. And Justin really almost beat Giannis 3-0.
SPEAKER_06: it was really close to being over before Yannis came back. So yeah, it's, I mean, listen, it's, it's, it was, it was Mandaugas beating Justin in a close match and, and Yannis beating Justin in even a more,
SPEAKER_00: just in almost one match that's all and then just justin was stronger when justin pull mindagas justin was like four or five years or something since the kovit as far as i remember he didn't pull and then he trained like two or three months and then he pulled when when justin pull yanis he was much
SPEAKER_06: more prepared. So that is... And I like that too, because I want to be wrong about this. I would much rather watch a great match and Giannis come out victorious, but I don't think it's going to be that close. I think Vidalgas is a bad dude. A bad dude.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And people are talking about you butchering the Eastern guys' names, you know. Okay. Okay. What is it? Georgie Fedkoff. Yeah. Georgie. Georgie Fedkoff. Oh, Georgie. Georgie Fedkoff. Okay. Say the other ones. Say a few of them. I don't know. Who else? Dave Chafee. I'm on that one. Who else? That's Americans. We're talking about Eastern names. Yeah, I know, but I don't have to worry about that in Arlington, so.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, Shaginasvili, is that it? Come on, you do the intonation. Shaginasvili. Shaginasvili, okay. No, Sa, Sa, Sa, not Sha. Sa. Oh, yes, I say Sa all the time. Shaginasvili, yeah. Yes, I say that all the time, maybe on purpose. Okay, how about Irakli's last name? Irakli, what is his name? Irakli. Come on.
SPEAKER_00: It's got the Shagadishvili kind of thing, too. No, Zirakashvili. Yeah, Zirakashvili. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. That's horrible. Okay, let me not give you a hard time, you know. Yeah. Georgi Fedkov. Fedkov, you are saying, you are being disrespectful. Yeah, I will tell this to Georgi. No, man, listen, that's going to be a great match.
SPEAKER_00: Listen, listen, we are going to go there. Okay, let's go there. That's a good one. A lot of people thinking that Dave doesn't have a chance or something, they are mistaken. They are. They are mistaken. I'm not saying that Dave is going to win, but there is a...
SPEAKER_06: uh there is a possibility that they may yeah you can be down you can be down two three nothing waiting on dave to lose his hand if you're not careful and if you're but the problem is is i mean go how do you say it i just want to say georgie why can't i say this okay just say georgie it's okay yeah you got me thinking the other name that i'm saying it's so wrong it's disrespectful but no no i just think that
SPEAKER_06: dave looks stronger right dave looks like his hand is keeping and he eventually he is his hands gonna start to open up it's just that what round does it happen and if he's not if if georgy's not careful dave will be up dave will be up two three nothing and then it's over and i think that i think that dave is the underdog
SPEAKER_00: I think that the hand and wrist positioning that Fedkoff has, he's had it every time. If you watch him and Devin, he had great. Yeah, I will tell you something. He has the hand, but it is possible Dave should not allow Georgie to do this, but he can stay like straight. And then when the ball is straight, Dave has incredible side pressure. So there is a possibility Georgie to have his pronator and wrist, but his arm to move.
SPEAKER_00: like this, sideways. And then if Dave goes and if his wrist goes back, then this is hard. Yeah, but it has to be low. It has to be kind of low, kind of. Even the halfway, halfway down is, I think, enough. It doesn't have to be that close. And what round is that, too? Is that round one? And then round two? I think that it should be an early round because I believe that Georgie has very good endurance.
SPEAKER_06: exactly yeah dave needs to dave doesn't need to have any of this the first match dave needs to be there match two right at the end a little bit and then match three maybe doing what you're doing dave if dave has to come up and push before round three i think i think that it's gonna be a great day for the bulgarians yeah i'd say 55 45 dave's the underdog but great match great man
SPEAKER_00: Okay, tell me the first name of Dadikian. David, right? David, yes. You didn't say David. David Dadikian. Yeah, I love him. Listen, I ain't saying his name wrong, man. Yeah, David, you said good, yeah. That's my guy. That's my dude. Okay, so how about Morozov's first name? I was gone, right?
SPEAKER_00: Alijan is Murato, not Morozov. Hold up. Oh, oh, Artem. Yeah, Artem, Artem, yeah. Oh, okay, yeah. To me, that's Artem. Yeah, yeah, you're right. So you are Alijan Morozov. Yeah, you got me there. I thought I was right. Anyway, but listen, that's why we love you. I mean, I love you as you are, my friend, yeah. And, yeah, so...
SPEAKER_06: um let's go to sarah beckman versus jocelyn man this is another one so i think that like when i see sarah's loss to gabby i mean i just feel like that that's so close that was so close if sarah was just a little bit stronger and then when i see how strong gabby is i mean even in her loss against
SPEAKER_06: against Barb. I mean, yeah, like still crazy arm strength. So to me, Sarah, Sarah can win. And then you just, I mean, you can't help but check out that round Robin when the girl just went through them.
SPEAKER_06: easy but i mean i'm looking at sarah every day just like artem for his match with alden she's training everything yeah yeah i don't know why that i would think that anything's gonna be different but i mean for some reason i think sarah's gonna win even though i guess the girl is strong
SPEAKER_06: This girl. But I've never met the girl. So I think maybe because of that. But I did see her beat everybody in that round robin.
SPEAKER_06: Oh, you were there? Were you there? I wasn't there, but I saw the video, and I was like, wow. And it really didn't look that close. The girl's strong. So great opportunity for that girl, honestly, because you need some fresh faces. And what we need is for the fresh face to knock off one of the top four, whether it's –
SPEAKER_06: Sarah, Egna, Vara, or Gabby. We know how good those four are. Let's see if we could put another person in there, especially a convincing win from that girl, and that girl's gonna get a shot. So, you know. Yeah, by the way, her name is Egla. Egla, what'd I say? Egna. Same thing. I don't see it.
SPEAKER_00: See, people already wrote Egna, Egna, Egna. Everyone is saying Egna. Same thing, same thing. People like to use the opportunity. They are having fun. That's good, that's good, yeah. Let's have some fun, you know, yeah. And imagine that if you were not doing these kind of things, we wouldn't have this laughing. With nothing, yeah, life would be terrible. Life would be terrible. Okay, so...
SPEAKER_06: Ungarbaev versus Matt Mask. Wow. This to me is the best one. This is the most entertaining one. And there's a chance that Ungarbaev kills him. There is a chance that he kills him. But there's also a chance that Matt Mask has legitimately...
SPEAKER_06: turn the corner the guy had a lot of matches that didn't go his way kind of in the background whispered that just had a lot of medical problems elbow wrist hand whatever the deal is the guy then goes gets the stem cells and and says hey i feel better i feel different and then he starts
SPEAKER_06: climate and except for that little small problem with Brad in Orlando when I looked at Matt and saw that he was way too light and was going through some things and that he wasn't going to be that strong and he bounces right back with another win. I am rooting for Matt Mask, but this is a monumental task.
SPEAKER_00: beating Anurbaev. I mean, it wasn't too long ago. He was the pound for pound in the talk. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But after that, he lost Tata Kings, and then he lost against Petrenko, and then he had elbow surgery, and then they moved a piece of bone from his elbow, and now this is his comeback match. And while what I saw in Atlantic City, Matt against Marcio Barbosa,
SPEAKER_00: wow i mean it was it was really like dominance you know i mean yeah i know i know he's good and he beat him in the past as well but this one just shows it is in very good shape right now but i don't know if it will be enough or not time will show yeah yeah and that's a good one that's a good one that's a good one
SPEAKER_00: And Zenzu says, hey, Travis, planning on pulling again in East versus West. I got to get stronger. I can't go. No. I made a big mistake. I made a big mistake. I thought that you could just, in a short time, you could be that good. But I didn't even realize the level is so high. It's dangerous up there. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It is dangerous. You got to be on it. You got to be on it. Yeah, yeah. But if you are ready this time, I'm not going to tell you to pull this guy or that guy. I will just say, who do you want to pull? Unless it is a ridiculous idea, I will set that match. You heard that. You hear that, guys? Let me know. Let me know who's interested. I think me and Larry Wills need to get after it. That's my guess. Oh, yeah. It would be good. But would he accept it?
SPEAKER_00: Do you know who would be good? Leonidas versus you would be good. Yeah, he's strong too. How about you versus Skullboy? That would be good too. When? I like Skullboy. How long do you need? How long do you need? Oh, 2026.
SPEAKER_00: I didn't say Hermes. I said schoolboy. Schoolboy. I like schoolboy. I can beat schoolboy, I think, maybe. What about Brian Shaw? What about Brian Shaw? Brian Shaw, we can't really put him into, like, against a real arm wrestler. I don't think so. I mean, we can, but not now. Yeah, and honestly, I don't want to pull Brian Shaw anyway. He's too big, and if it is awkward, I don't want them to do that shit either.
SPEAKER_06: because it is sometimes it is awkward than big dudes man they're weird yeah let's let's continue uh cool boy yeah i like school boy okay sharkovich versus arsene cachetarian do you know it's gonna be tough yep i do i knew both of them and this is gonna be tough for shark but hey listen just like brad
SPEAKER_06: every once in a while you're gonna get the call whether you're ready or not stay ready and shark's got a tremendous opportunity shark is good shark is really strong and what i see from shark when he's arm wrestling here he doesn't even to me look that threatened and he's letting them guys pull all kinds of ways that they want so i'm i hope that um
SPEAKER_06: i hope that shark comes in and he's and he is successful because he's uh he's he's put in a lot of work so but definitely uphill battle i think he's an underdog cody versus evgeny left arm yeah this is a tough one man because there was a time when this would have been when prudnik would have been a heavy favorite in my eyes but prudnik you know definitely not the prudnik
SPEAKER_06: you know, of two years ago, three years ago, the last couple times out. And then I see him a little more active on social media, a little more training. There is a,
SPEAKER_06: there is a version of Prudnik that comes in and wins this pretty easy, not easily, but wins. And then, but if he's not, then he is going to listen. Cody is going to fire off. Cody is going to fire off outside far. So I'll be rooting for Cody Merritt, but this is dangerous territory because I think that Prudnik is better than he showed lately. And that there is,
SPEAKER_06: He didn't get those wins on Dada Khan and other people for no reason. There was a time when Prudnik was the dude. So he can get back there, and if he does, and I think the easiest way is when you can eat whatever you want. So Prudnik could be dangerous when he gets there. I'm rooting for Cody, but 60-40 Prudnik. Okay, Gabriel Hernandez says that Travis versus Voivoda in Canada once again.
SPEAKER_00: Canada, I can't even go to Canada. Oh, there was like, yeah, I remember that day. You were underdog. I was talking with you. I think that part is on the pulling John. Yeah, we were talking and I was telling you, you have nothing to lose.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, that's good. That's good. I was strong because I was trying to beat Dave Randall. No, you were strong because of the guy, you know. No, that was later. No, you said you guys watched the video. You guys watched the video.
SPEAKER_06: Well, Mike Solaris took the class and he gave me the hypnotism the night before. He did do that, but it was Mike. And I was like his first patient. Yeah. But I'll take it. I love Mike and I believe in that shit. There ain't no doubt about it. And I'm cool with nobody else believing it, but I believe it. I got a feeling you kind of believe it.
SPEAKER_00: not not kind of believe it i believe it i know i know i know how i felt it in the finals and i know how i felt next day i know how i felt in the morning the competition i don't know what happened but john augustine i have said it before and i will say it again it was travis and cobra that got me into arm wrestling after watching them
SPEAKER_00: on Game of Arms. I will forever be grateful to them for introducing me to the sport. Well, you're welcome, young man. You are very, very welcome. A lot of people watch that show. Yeah, yeah. One guy says,
SPEAKER_00: Mago, thank you again for showing love to Texas. Already bought my VIP tickets. Thank you, guys. You guys deserve. Texas is one of the best fan base. Yeah. And so let's go. Let's go to Craig Tuller versus John Terry. Hey, listen. I think that if you're not careful...
SPEAKER_06: Craig looks like the overwhelming favorite, but I'm telling you now, this John Terrian dude, this guy is amazing. This guy is strong. So I think, you know, Craig's going to have to pack a lunch to beat this kid, man.
SPEAKER_06: This kid is strong. This kid just, he doesn't even know how to really arm wrestle left-handed. He just beat my man from Florida, Price, who is so strong left-handed. John Terrian is going to give it. He's going to give Craig hell. This is 50-50. 50-50. And man, the U.S. really needs this. We really need this win. Definitely. It's the underdog on some of the others.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, now let's go. Okay, Devon came to Tbilisi. He was scary. Big, strong, you saw it, yeah. And then he decided to skip the May event. He wanted to rest a little bit. And before the May event, he wanted to pull a left arm match. But my belief,
SPEAKER_06: Devon that we saw in Tbilisi and Devon that we will see in Arlington will not be the same. It will not be like a huge difference, but we won't see the same guy, my opinion. And how do you see this match? Yeah, I don't, you know, I think you're going to see maybe a better version of him because I think that sometimes he pushes in a weird, weird place. Like it was, I could see him and feel him breathing.
SPEAKER_06: he was around me the other day when we were at that press conference so i think he's going to be better 15 pounds lighter so i think he's going to be 285 287 um
SPEAKER_06: And listen, I'm telling you, man, I don't know what he is doing, but this man is not human right now. He looks awesome. His left arm probably not, you know, it's not probably as good as his right arm, but it doesn't need to be. And Cody or Corey leaves all kinds of doors and windows open.
SPEAKER_06: right now if you come through the front door sometimes there's a shotgun right there and he'll blow your head off he's got a great lane got great power he's good he's really good i don't think he can win three times against this guy because it's almost impossible not to have to pull for some extended period of time and now
SPEAKER_06: Man, he's strong. Devin is strong. So, I mean, I saw it when he's gripping up with these people left-handed. I mean, he's strong and Corey is really good, but Corey's not amazing. Corey's not amazing at the highest level. You know, I mean, he's good. Do you think that stylistically it may be different because Kamil went here
SPEAKER_06: And Morozo was like this, and now Devlin is going out. Do you think there will be more room, Corey, to apply this? Of course, yeah. I mean, Corey's got a better chance than everyone does. Like nothing, Corey doesn't possess the ability to out-angle, out-leverage, and
SPEAKER_06: top role, he's usually stronger than the guy in the guys trying to take some position from him. So luckily for Corey, he'll be in a better situation.
SPEAKER_06: Devin will be looking to manipulate in order to stop the match. And Corey has to keep the lane closed, under control, safe. Make sure he doesn't do a lot of gripping pre-match. Go right to the set grip. Make sure that Devin is trying his best not to let him swing and move, which is very tough over the long haul. Devin might be strong enough in a hook.
SPEAKER_06: right after the three-second, right after he knocks the, you know, just a little bit off of him. So I'm rooting for Corey. I'm rooting for the USA. But I can't see it. I think it's 80-20, the fact that you can't beat this guy three times. Can't beat him. But can he beat him one or two times? Oh, definitely. Yeah, really, definitely. I mean, listen, he gets in them straps and the referee –
SPEAKER_06: gets very, very funky. And when I say funky, I just mean straight fair. Like straight fair, get it in here. Do not allow him to start pulling. And listen, he's going to tighten up.
SPEAKER_06: But there's tightening up and then there is taking your shoulder and moving it back as you turn to say go. And listen, Devin only gets away with that because he's amazing. He is killing it right now. Top of his game. Dude's awesome. He's probably going to beat Corey West. And I hope I'm wrong. Man, I hope I'm wrong.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Top roll is for smart says the problem with Devon is if the match is 50 50 in terms of strength, they will be in a hundred percent except maybe from guy like Gennady. I don't know what he means, but I think I understand. But, um, another match, John versus can I, I think is incredible. Yeah, man. I called John and I said, man, my shoulder hurts for you.
SPEAKER_00: Because I don't see a place where Yoshi doesn't win one. And once he wins one, I think he'll win the next two. Wait, wait, wait. One second, one second. Okay, you and I, let's discuss a little bit. Don't you think that Yoshi is good mostly, you know, here? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Did you realize that every time Todd took him there and he tried to pin-pin, maybe even one or two times, like Todd almost was going to try this, like he was going behind. And then Todd probably realized that he's not that good at the shoulder press. But do you think that if the match is here,
SPEAKER_00: and John has opportunities to go behind. Because just watch the older matches. The one that you saw when you were in Japan, John was heavy, strong, and dominated. But what I'm just saying, other times you look at it, John is finishing Yoshi with the shoulder pressure. Like if he has that ability. Yeah, and I think he will do that. I think, I'm just wondering, he better hope he doesn't have to do that match one.
SPEAKER_06: he needs to go ahead and take him on down there really close have a little pause and then parallel pin him max two is why can't you like the same thing three times why yeah yeah i'm saying he bet he can't do it three times three times in a row why listen well he can do it i'm just telling you the third time i know john if he's up two to nothing he's gonna be nicer to yoshi
SPEAKER_00: And I don't think there's going to be one inch that he can give. There's not. I mean, it's going to be close. And then, I mean, Yoshi showed me that he's got power. He's got power. But listen, in which way? Listen, the guy is with the strap. He is just pulling you like this, you know, so good. If you try to pull him or pin him sideways or to your way, he's pulling your arm, you know.
SPEAKER_06: But whenever you are pulling a guy, if the guy doesn't mind and he's even giving you some help, you know, because you're going back and then he's coming forward. So I, I, I kind of, I love that. I love, I hope that you are right. No, no. And what I think is going to happen is that John is going to find that it's really hard to pin and match one.
SPEAKER_06: And then that'll be it. Then it'll be the Yoshi show from then on. Three to one, Yoshi. And I'm mad. I am praying that I am wrong.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Lagia says that Kanai doesn't have his side pressure and explosiveness anymore. Maybe Lagia, we don't know that maybe because he was pulling against Tata Sings. And so usually when you are going sideway with Tata Sings, you look like you don't have side pressure. Yeah, I mean, let's just be honest about, I mean, you take away, you take away a Rackley's win, right? And Yoshi pulls Todd.
SPEAKER_00: better than Irakli did. Yeah, Irakli has some problems with that match.
SPEAKER_06: Let's not go there right now, but I think he will. I mean, I'm not saying directly he's not a favorite against Yoshi. I'm telling you that John's last showing was not as impressive as the John's in the past. John is a sucker for being nice to guys. He's going to run into a three-minute war with Yoshi, man, and it's over.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think that John is going to have three minutes. Either he's going to have the advantage and win, or he's just going to let it go. He's smart enough not to really exhaust himself. I hope you're right. Todd and Oleg's love child says something. He says, greatest promoter with greatest showman. Let's go. Which one am I?
SPEAKER_00: I think both of them knew. And Benji says, Florida energy was insane. Texas will be wild. How was the energy in Florida, Orlando?
SPEAKER_06: I know it was crazy. It was crazy. We were too big in that little place. It was so hot and it was amazing. But I felt like Tbilisi was ridiculous and the card. The amount of champions was just...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we will have incredible events. Incredible events. I have my boards on the wall. I'm just doing repairs and everything. It's getting harder when we have the American events because of the visa problems. Yeah, that sucks. That's a sad reality. I wish that wasn't happening. Are we going to see Vitaly and Michael Todd soon? May. It's already set? Nice. And the 10th or 17th? Do you have the dates yet?
SPEAKER_00: I think it's not a hundred percent, but it looks like 17th. Okay. Yeah. And, and it will be, it will be, Vitaly better do his own work. Very good. You know, otherwise that may be problematic. I'm not saying that Michael is the strongest guy.
SPEAKER_06: but he's positive to me. He's going to force you to show some patience. I don't think Vitaly has shown us that patience yet. Not that he doesn't have it, he just hasn't had it. What are the chances? Give us some percentage.
SPEAKER_06: I mean, I think that it's still, you can't ignore your eyesight and Vitaly's amazing. So I think that a lot of people think that that's a 80, 20, 90, 10, but it's not, that's a 65, 35, 60, 40. And me being American, I'm going to say, I'm going to say 55, 45 is where I'm at. I'm a Turkish guy. I'm a Turkish guy. I see that like.
SPEAKER_00: We can go anywhere. We can better finish that, you know, quick. No doubt. Yeah. And yeah, it will be incredible. But you can't let Rebecca come. Why is that? You can't let the wives up there. You saw Hermes and
SPEAKER_00: No, no, everything is okay. No, no, Michael and Hermes, you know, they respect each other. No, no, Hermes would never disrespect Rebecca. Yeah, you can't have the women up there. Rebecca never deserves that. No more wives allowed at the events. It's over. No, no, no, come on, you're joking here. I know what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways, yeah, yeah. And let's go to one more thing before we...
SPEAKER_00: Was Devin right when he said that all three Americans will beat La Latin this year? No, he wasn't right about it. Okay, can I ask you something? But, I mean, because you're not going to get all three of them, you're not going to get all three of them on the card in a year. No, no, who knows, who knows, who knows. Just one second. You said 65-35 for La Latin, or you said 60-40 or something. So you are thinking that La Latin is still favorites.
SPEAKER_06: And then let's go to the Jerry versus Vitaly. Yeah. You know what, man, I gotta, I gotta be careful when I talk about Jerry, because Jerry is two different people. There is a Jerry that is awesome. And then there's a Jerry that you can tell a month before it, that he ain't, he ain't, he ain't getting after it the right way. So, you know, and then, and then.
SPEAKER_06: Like, what I saw him against Alex, I mean, oh my goodness. It's like, this guy's so awesome. Come on. Come on. You know better than this. You are looking at...
SPEAKER_06: Alex versus Jerry, and then you look at Jerry versus Levan, and you are thinking that Jerry was awesome in one of them. No, no, no, no. I think that it just sucks that then we see Alex lose to Datacon, right? So now it's like... There was left arm. There was left arm. I know, but I'm just saying, it's like, ah, ah. Is what, how I felt when he pulled Alex, was that true?
SPEAKER_06: All that admiration. And I'm like, oh, shit. But then we see Jerry and LeVon. LeVon's so strong that immediately now I got a bad taste in my mouth. And I'm like, oh, I don't know. Listen, Jerry and Vitaly are 50-50 because Vitaly hasn't shown any patience yet.
SPEAKER_06: of dealing with Michael Todd or Jerry. That's why Devin can get away with that, saying that. But the truth is, is that Vitaly might beat Devin. There's a good chance that Vitaly can beat Devin. What's the good chance? I think it's 55-45.
SPEAKER_06: Devin, which to me is really 50-50. Like, I'm going to tell you something. Like, Devin has to really be careful. Vitaly has a leverage and an angle and positioning and timing, and he can finish the match. He can finish it. And
SPEAKER_06: you can't get higher and make Vitaly uncomfortable. If you want to try to make him uncomfortable, Devin, you got to dad's move him and get a little lower. I don't know if you want to do that against that guy, but he's not going to mind. If you hold him low, he's going to flash pin you. That's exactly, and I mean, but I think, you know, if Devin goes up high, Devin, you know, there's another level, even though Devin was able to crack Armis' hand
SPEAKER_06: There's a leverage difference. Vitaly's pulling those guys like this. He's going to be able to pull Devin with them knuckles straight up in the air. I think he's going to like pulling Devin. I think he's going to like where the hands are in relationship to the elbow pads. So Devin has to be careful with Vitaly, and Vitaly has to be careful with Michael and Devin. So he really does. Because Devin, I think, has more in-match capability
SPEAKER_06: to take care of guys like Jerry and Michael Todd. We don't know if Vitaly, and it doesn't look like he does possess that, but that's just my opinion. But the truth is he just hasn't shown it.
SPEAKER_06: He hasn't shown the ability to plan his feet, to maneuver his upper body around and do it. I think the most impressive thing we saw was with Morozov, but it was more of a panicky transitions. It wasn't as smooth. It wasn't, to me, it didn't look as smooth. So all of those things are true. Michael Todd and Jerry could possibly beat him. And here's another true statement. Vitaly could possibly beat Devin. That could happen.
SPEAKER_00: I think that's very close. I mean, it depends, you know, how the match will go once it starts. And everyone needs to keep remaining.
SPEAKER_06: sharp and getting stronger and being healthy i mean you can't afford any setback one minor setback whether your your family member passes away you get a flu you can you can you know you can be in trouble quickly because of everyone's pushing everyone is pushing and i have been
SPEAKER_06: times when i didn't know i was that strong i'm the strongest i could be in times when i thought i had no chance of losing for some reason it doesn't i don't feel it that day so it's very close it's very big one last question
SPEAKER_06: Hermes and LeVon, once again, LeVon's the man. No one can beat him. There's no chance in hell. Wow. To me, Hermes showed me that he knows how to arm wrestle at a great level now. And I can't believe that year off made me not think as highly of him. I think that if Hermes, if you set the match and Hermes accepts the match, that he will be awesome forever.
SPEAKER_06: I still think that it will be a huge, shocking upset if he's able to beat him. And that's just, that is not a knock on Hermes. That is just showing respect to the champ and knowing. Now, I would much rather see Vitaly and or Devin for some reason than Hermes. And I understand that Hermes deserves it. And I know Hermes beat Vitaly the last time. And I get it. I just think that
SPEAKER_06: if we could somehow get LeBron fighting up all up in them fingers like Hermes and Vitaly was, that that's got to be, I don't know if that's the recipe, but... How about Michael versus LeBron? Yeah, once again, that could be really bad for Michael, but my goodness, if he somehow, if LeBron, if we have just figured that LeBron will just be overwhelming...
SPEAKER_06: and have no stoppages, right? They say go, LaVon gets control, goes to the pin and wins. We are imagining that's what's going to happen. What we need to think about is if Michael can force him
SPEAKER_06: to just have to log some time, to not be able to pin him, to have to press. Has Levan shown us, I mean he showed us a little bit with Devin, the ability to let it happen and then... Can I ask you something? In this defensive position, who is stronger? Devin or Michael?
SPEAKER_06: Against the deadliest pressure. Man, it used to not be close. You would answer Michael Todd there every time. But when I saw some clips of Devin now, and he sits back, and he's got these guys pulling two hands, and they're trying hard. No, I understand. Whenever you do two hands, you are usually pulling this way. I'm talking about the one. Yeah, I mean... It doesn't really...
SPEAKER_00: I'm impressed right now with Devin all the way. More like having center, having this, you understand? I don't know if right now, I don't know if Michael Todd has a spot that he's necessarily stronger than Devin right now. Okay, if Michael B is Vitaly,
SPEAKER_06: Will it make your opinion a little change like that might Michael chance against? Every time someone wins you have to you have to respect that you got no choice like I mean I was I'm telling you without seeing army pull a lot I was a and then all of a sudden BAM right back at the top
SPEAKER_06: That's why he's got a shot at the title. That's why his name's in the top three because he's awesome. Did you know that Gennady will pull next event at 115 kilos? Yeah, I can see that. Yeah, I can see that. And what are we looking at? Him and the guy that beat the second place guy, Ibrahim, who we got? Reno is injured. Reno is injured, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: The other guy. What was the guy? We don't know yet. We don't know yet. But Reno, we will do interim title. Because Reno cannot pull even one year with right arm. Not at this level, yeah. So Reno will remain champion, but there will be an interim championship title. And then when Reno comes back, he will be pulling against the champion. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Hey, let's put Todd, tell Todd Hutchins to gain some weight. And he pulled Gennady. Todd Hutchins is pulling Rustam Baba next event, world title. That's good, man. He's never been able to crack that. Yeah. That's a good one. I think Rustam beat him eight times, you know. Yeah, if you think about that too, like, there's a lot of people that are going to be rooting for Rustam because they got a better chance maybe with Rustam than Todd in their mind.
SPEAKER_00: This is good. That's a good one. I think Todd will win this time. Anything is possible. The guy is... He's our guy, dude. Todd Miller is our guy, Ingen. Rustam is also very experienced. Very experienced, yeah. Rustam, like, very experienced. In that category, he is probably top two experience together with Tata Shinks, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Awesome. Yeah, he's awesome. He's awesome. No doubt. All right, my man. Thank you very much, Travis. Thank you very, very much. And thanks to everyone who has been following us, watching us, and writing comments. You take care. I'll see you in Texas. I'll see you in Texas. Don't try to skip it. Take care of yourself. And tell everyone I said hello. Okay, guys. You all take care. No, no. 115 kilos will not be boned.
SPEAKER_00: Gennady used to pull 90 kilos, 100 kilos, 110 kilos. So, Aydar Khan versus Samusha in Kazakhstan? No, because Aydar Khan has a competition, probably Asian Championships, I think, around that time. And, yeah, so I don't think that will happen, yeah. But sooner or later, it will happen. Anyways, guys, thank you very, very much.
SPEAKER_00: It is after midnight here, and let me rest a little bit. You'll take care of yourself.
