SPEAKER_02: Hey, buddy. How are you? Good, how are you? That's good. Hello, Michael. Hey, bud. How's everybody doing? Good, good. Great. Michael, why do you look so small on the camera? I don't know, man. I'm just what normal human beings look like, I guess, you know? Sorry.
SPEAKER_00: Hello, Robert. Hey, Michael, Corey. What is up? Ingen, I think I saw Ingen on there a minute ago. Yeah, can you guys, Corey, turn your phone sideways and you as well, Robert? Yes. Oh, Michael's here too. What's up? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Ah, very good. Very good. So, has this guy got a chance in hell, Mike? Listen, he's really strong. I mean, you grabbed him a bunch. His hand... You didn't say yes, though. Well, I mean, of course he has a chance. Everybody has a chance. I just...
SPEAKER_02: I told, I've said this on several lives already. I think you, you have to be, uh, if Corey's not a level stronger, which there's a chance that he might be then, you know, your experience and. You think you're gonna kill him? You think you're gonna kill him? I think you're gonna kill him. I think he's really strong. I think he's really strong. No, but that's not what you're saying. Oh, Joey's giving me a hard time. Jody's yelling at me already. She's saying, uh,
SPEAKER_00: I'm interrupting. Sorry Michael, what are you guys talking when you guys are alone with Corey?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I haven't got to see Corey that much the last couple of weeks. We've been busy. He's been busy. So you guys never get to talk to each other about this much? Well, we chat about it. We chat about it. And a lot of it is I think Corey's going to be very well prepared. And I mean, he's in a perfect situation. Yes, he's pretty much known as the number one in North America left-handed. So he does have that on the line. What does pretty much mean?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I mean, because of the whole interesting thing with Cody and Pablo and then Corey being, you know, it's just, there was a little bit of discrepancy there for a minute. I'm pretty sure everyone thinks Corey's the number one guy. Um, and now you get a chance to, uh, well, Pablo beat Cody first. So Corey, Corey beat Pablo. Then Corey went to an event, um, where he wasn't at his best and he, he didn't, he lost on fouls. So then Cody became number one, North America. And then before.
SPEAKER_02: Corey got to pull Cody, Pablo beat Cody. Well, then Corey pulled Cody again, but even probably worse than Pablo did. But so there was this little hiccup there for a bit. But the last seven years, I think Corey... And I beat Pablo. But you beat Pablo like over a year ago. Right. But between the two of us,
SPEAKER_02: I've beaten Pablo, he's beaten Cody. Yeah, he's never got to pull Pablo left-handed. But yeah, it's just so, that being said, he does have that on the line, but anytime you get a chance to be the main event against Devin Laird at a show, I mean, you take that match. Are we the main event? I can't imagine how you're not the main event. I don't know how the show runs, but I would assume you're the main event. No, John versus Kanai is the main event. Oh, wow. Okay. This may be the last match of John.
SPEAKER_00: He's going to have surgery. We don't know. He's going to have a back surgery. I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't mention, but yeah, this may be his last match. I don't know. I hope he comes back. I don't know. Robert, you would know better.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you know, I don't know if he wanted this publicized, but yeah, he's having a lower back surgery, you know, after this match, and I'm not sure what's going to happen. So hopefully he'll be back, but he didn't want to do anything publicly, you know, and say he's retiring because he doesn't know, but he's hoping that he'll be able to continue, but we don't know.
SPEAKER_00: So, potentially, last match against Yoshi Kanai. Potentially. Probably his last match as a career, you know. That's unbelievable. Yeah, I agree. Today, I talked with Tobias' trainer.
SPEAKER_00: and tobias said to him that devon i am the king of north america if you remember to become the king first you need to beat corey as i did and then you need to beat me as well listen he's not the is he the king of north america is that what he thinks he is listen when you go to georgia and beat someone and you say you are the king of the georgia am i the king of georgia is that how that works i don't know that's what you claim so why can he not
SPEAKER_00: he's like 23 years old okay he's he's the king of his parents basement probably cody cody i don't know if he be if you beat cody i think i think he wants to pull against you yeah and i want to pull him yeah yeah maybe june yeah june event but but cody cody will will devon get yeah cody yeah
SPEAKER_03: He will, he will get to Devon. We'll get to pull Tobias. Devon's Devon. He's going to get the match with Tobias, even if he loses. I mean, it doesn't make sense anymore. If he loses now, Corey, let me ask you something, Mike, you too, actually, why not everybody on the panel? Is it outrageous that me really not a lot of training, really not really just kind of showing up. I'm like, everybody thinks I'm going to win.
SPEAKER_03: Everybody on this whole panel thinks I'm going to win. Isn't that crazy? I bet you do more left-handed training than Corey does. Probably. I feel like I'm just rolling in. Like, I feel like I'm just getting started. Okay. Who is thinking that way? Corey, you think that one is going to beat you? You are thinking that way. Corey's thinking that way. Michael's thinking that way. Everybody's thinking that way. Corey, do you think he's going to beat you? No.
SPEAKER_03: No, Michael lying. We all know, listen, we're not four or five. We all know that that's a lie. It's okay to lie. The silence silence comes from acceptance. So Michael, you have an answer for what they don't claim. Well, I say it's 55, 45 Corey going into the match. Oh, you have to say that. That was like LeBron when he said 50, 50, same thing, same thing. It's okay. You know what?
SPEAKER_03: So much of life is about accuracy. Accuracy. That's all. Makes a brave man to be accurate sometimes and say, I got to sweep him. Do you think you can keep him from getting a pin? Easy. And I'm not even trying. And I'm not even really trying. Like I'm going to practice tonight. I'm going to beat up everybody at the club. I'll train right until I get on the plane.
SPEAKER_03: I'll keep training my right because there's big things coming right through. Yeah, no problem. So who sets the stakes on this? I mean, why are they not confident in making this a shutout stakes? It is a shutout stake. It is a shutout stake? It is. It is. Yeah. Oh, Corey, we got a bad idea. And nobody thinks Corey can win. It's great. Nobody. Nobody.
SPEAKER_00: And that look, it's right there. I mean, people can put the money down like whatever I look at. I'm not as soon as it's me. I'm never involved. Never involved. Michael, when the goal comes, can Devon Stonewall call it or Devon is going to go to the winnings? Corey is going to go to the winning side.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it would be hard for me to imagine Corey and I going to the winning side. Okay, but remember, Corey, at the Monster Factory, Corey, at the Monster Factory, like one time, Paulo top rolled you from like a little bit losing, and then you put your shoulder and you press him. Looks like you have that ability. Do you think that if you put Devin to the losing side position, and then you think you can press him?
SPEAKER_00: I mean, that's the plan. That's the plan. That was supposed to be a secret, Egan. That was supposed to be a secret. No, I have been saying this every podcast. I have been saying that every podcast. Yeah, I have not watched because that was supposed to be our secret strategy right there. I mean, not for anyone who knows arm wrestling. And another thing is that the way that you beat Tobias when it went to the strap.
SPEAKER_02: It was impressive. Listen, Tobias is amazing, but Corey was a stronger human being that day. He was definitely the stronger human being. Tobias had phenomenal speed, very good timing. If that comes down to power, Corey was definitely the stronger human. That's why he won when he was able to sleep and go to sleep. Robert, you are not saying anything. I'm just listening. This is great.
SPEAKER_03: I'm learning a lot from you guys. Devon's very confident, which I expected. And Michael's very confident. So I want to hear from you. You are such a nice guy. What you have to learn is that Robert is very diplomatic and he's very, he doesn't want to pick sides, but he knows he's not, he's not silly. Robert knows I'm going to destroy Corey.
SPEAKER_02: What is your definition of destroy? Like, what do you mean by destroy? Cause like, I want to see how accurate, what, what do you mean? I mean, I know like destroy, destroy my book means total annihilation. Zero. Yes. I just, I, you're going to have to be very, very strong to be able to do that. Michael. Zero. You know, you guys want me to help you with something? Let me help you. Back to me again. Okay. What do we got? All of you.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that a small number has one digit? Is this a trick question? Well, a small number, it would have one digit, right? It should, yeah. So what are our base numbers? Just tell us, Evan. Can you count? Can you count? Zero.
SPEAKER_02: Wonderful. What do you want? What do you got? No, that's perfect. That's perfect. I'm walking into something here. I know. No, you're not. You're not. You're not. So many people start from one. Great question. It seems like a loaded question for sure. I'm telling you. I hate that I'm even on this thing right now. It's about y'all. What's going on, Corey? Tell me what you can do to him, Corey. Zero. Zero results.
SPEAKER_00: Zero is a confusing number, isn't it? Zero. Corey, do you have any answer? Zero, Michael. Zero. Zero chance. Corey, do you have any answer about Canada being so mighty over US or something? Do you have any answer for that? Devin doesn't even believe that. He's just talking. We're up here. We're up here.
SPEAKER_03: You guys and your cushy winters and crops available. You come to Canada. The only people who live here are hard people. We're only strong up here. You can't be a real Canadian and be a fucking weakling. Per capita, we destroy you. As is evidence. As is evidence. I apologize. Listen, who's going to beat me in North America? Who is going to beat me?
SPEAKER_00: michael i know it bothers you i don't give a left hand right hand none of you guys can beat me none of you corey zero you need to be michael you need to be as brave as devon when he's talking like this
SPEAKER_03: I don't think it's called bravery. Mike is not even in his fight, unfortunately. He's going to be just a casualty of war standing across the stage as I beat up his buddy. It's terrible. I hate it. I hate it. I used to beat up Europeans. And now look, they've downgraded me. They've downgraded me to having to clean up North America. I thought I was the king and I thought everybody knew it.
SPEAKER_03: Left-hand it doesn't matter. Well, it left been a while. Like it's been a while since you were king. It has been a while, but I don't think I'm changed. I don't think any, and Travis, where are you? Where are you? Nowhere. We can't bring Travis up. No, you can't. And the thing is, is the rest of you guys, I'm going to steamroll all of you.
SPEAKER_03: Who else is there? So you got Corey, who else you got left? Cody, Pavlo, Nick Stone, Corey. That's it. Nobody else. Have you pulled Cody Merritt? In practice. Michael, stop ignoring that. That's another Jordan Svetkov situation. Stop ignoring that, Michael, and answer it. When he says that, that also means right turn.
SPEAKER_03: I don't care. I have other fish to fry right now. I've got a big rush and I got to have tried to handle in eight weeks. I'm going to have all the discussions on one. I've got to go. And you know what, Michael, after you beat him, he's going to totally tuck tail. And if he does manage to beat you, there's no way he's going to face me because he knows he'll lose and it'll look bad for LaVon. Maybe and then you won't even let him cause you got no faith in him. Probably that's more to the truth because Vitaly's got some nuts.
SPEAKER_00: No, the only thing is that if you beat him, you don't want to face Levan end of this year. And we need an opponent for he is willing to pull you in August. Anybody in the top 10. I'll pull Levan. You want to see me pull him up? The truth is I'm the number two guy. Everybody knows I'm the number two guy. Way too far in the conversation. Devin will not be pulling Vitaly to get a shot at pulling Levan.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah yeah the only thing is i'm just like you know y'all don't jump ahead about possibilities no no yeah i'll pull them anyway i said that north americans that beat him i said you were going to beat him then i'd beat him i'm just saying england jumped ahead and said he's going to pull you and then pull him on in december yeah that's what he wants this is what i'm saying that's not even going to be a reality the reality is i have well they wouldn't even let him
SPEAKER_00: If the case came up, they wouldn't even let him pull me because they know that I'd beat him. No, there is a possibility that you beat him. Not that we know that you beat him. Well, then let him take me. Let him take me. If you think it's possible. You know what it is, Egan? You know what it is? It's zero. Zero. Zero chance. No, I'm going to accept the match. Listen, I'm going to accept the match. It's zero. We all know it. I don't care if he bypasses.
SPEAKER_00: But don't anybody say that I'm afraid of Vitaly. If you are going to promise me that if you beat him, you're going to pull LeVon in December, I will tell him if he beats Michael. If Michael wins, I think, Michael, you already made your mind that you are not going to pull anyone else in between. Here's the thing. When it comes to LeVon, I know exactly what that thing is. I know exactly. He's a monster. He's a monster. I'm not ready, but I will be.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but we need, we can't, not because I think that you will beat him or he will beat you, but we need some undefeated really guy to pull him, you know, just like, and if you beat him, you're not going to pull him. Why would we set him against you? Real sorry, Chev. So Corey, how's that left feeling?
SPEAKER_03: way better than Deb. All right. Hey, Corey. Okay. For Corey, I do have to say something. I don't believe in the shutout stakes. I believe Corey's going to win at least, um, some of his matches. I for sure believe that. Um, so Corey, you've got, you've got, uh, one more person in your corner. I think Devin believes that he, he, if we were talking about right-handed, it would be a different, different animal. Um,
SPEAKER_01: I mean, yes, I've made plenty of mistakes. I've got a lot to grow and learn in this sport, but he's not going to sweep me. Yeah, I believe that. So what does it take for you to win 3-0, Corey? What do you mean? What do you have to do? How do you have to win?
SPEAKER_01: I mean, you got to be a level stronger in my opinion, and you got to get the matches on with quickly, which I think you might be capable of doing. I mean, I really think there might be a gap. I'm just, go ahead. Truly believe when it comes to left-handed arm wrestling in this country, I'm the guy. What about in this continent? It's still a need how you threw that in there. Dude, you got, listen, here's the thing.
SPEAKER_03: You got something coming up in a couple months. You're going to have to learn how to jump. You're going to have to learn how to jump. Yeah. Right now you're holding on to that ledge. I'm going to murder you. Seriously. Seriously. And that's the thing. And you know it because no one in the room can stop me from doing it.
SPEAKER_03: i'll take everything we were talking about right-handed i would agree no no you don't understand you don't understand i didn't train my arm for six years and i was still right there the only person who beat me was that you know the rest of them no problem no problem easy days okay look at i cracked morzoff's wrist and everybody saw it that was 105. anyways corey
SPEAKER_03: I know that you're the bigger dude. A lot of people think you're going to win and you're strong and I'm unproven and I'm an idiot and I talk too much shit, but I'm just saying, I think I can do whatever I want with you. Really? Anything I want with you. I think what I'll do is I'll crack you. I think what I'll do is I'll take control from the stop. I'll crack you. I'm not going to be a retard. Okay. I'm not going to pull like fucking retard over there.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to pull you. I'm going to pull you. I'll beat you. And I'll let you give up. Are you intimidated, Corey? No. I'm ready. Okay. There is a super chat. Boss Royale says, Devon, Vitaly says, Master Michael Todd is more dangerous than you. What do you think?
SPEAKER_03: So he's going to get smoked by Michael. We all know that. We all know Mike's going to kill him. Mike's going to pull LeVon. And then I'm cleanup crew in August. I beat him in August. And then Jerry will beat him in December. That's how it's going to go. Thank you for understanding that you will lose to Michael and then me and then Jerry. Thank you, Vitaly. It's going to be a wonderful television year for you.
SPEAKER_02: I personally have great respect for Tally. I think he's an amazing wrestler. Me too, but you're going to beat him. I do plan on winning, but it's going to take an absolute perfect performance by me to win, in my opinion. I don't think you're going to have to be perfect. I think you're going to have to stop the match. You stop that match, and what's he going to do? What's he going to do? Is he going to impress you?
SPEAKER_02: Well, the thing is, listen, we all have the same belief, you and I anyway, in regards to how that plays out. But I'm not about to go into this thing underestimating him because he is lightning fast. He does have an insanely strong hand. And I have no idea what he might be working on, right? So I just have to be prepared for
SPEAKER_02: I have to stop the match. I have to be able to, you know, not panic, be smart, be patient, all those good, all those things. And I have to be strong enough. So the key for me, I believe moving forward is the strength has to be there. We all know how to arm wrestle at this level. We have a lot of experience. It comes down to, um, being strong enough to, to be in the match. Um, regardless of, you know, like, obviously I want my rise from pronation, all that stuff to be stronger, but, um,
SPEAKER_02: everything was a goal moving towards Lavon. We've all said, you've known that the whole time. So I just gotta, I've gotta get through this very big ask of this, uh, this very strong Russian athlete. So, um, regardless of whether I'm more difficult for him or you're more difficult for him, I don't really know. People can have their assumptions of what they think. I think you're very difficult for everyone right now. Um, I do think I'm a little stickier than you in, in, in that bottom position, but I think you're more versatile from the center of the table. So it makes it equally as
SPEAKER_03: difficult for people facing us in my opinion but he's very dominant in the center he's very probably has the most dominant center in the sport right now maybe him or levon bad dude center table dave chafee beat him in a flopper's press ermies beat him in a flop back position that's his last two big losses to higher rank guys you know he can't look at all the shit that ermies did
SPEAKER_03: You're doing something different by your same idea. Every time there's a stop match scenario, look at more as off gave him problems. And that shouldn't have been a fucking big marriage, you know, right-handed he doesn't do well with stop matches. He's a flasher. He's a flasher, even though he's had long matches, his gift is his ability to pin you quick. If he can't, you're going to run into problems.
SPEAKER_02: So this left arm match, Corey West. I'm shocked that you think you can do whatever you want with him, honestly. I mean, I don't know if that's just talk or if you genuinely believe that. Because there's spots that Corey can get into that he's trouble for anybody. For who? For me? Anybody. So that encompasses you and everyone else. If you let Corey get to certain spots. I thought Tobias Sporum straight up blasted him a couple times outside of straps.
SPEAKER_02: Clearly he was not in Corey's spot. I'm telling you, if you let Corey get into his lane and his spot, you're saying you can do anything you want with him. Yeah. Maybe I'll do that. Maybe I'll do that round three. Let you get into your spot. It'd be more impressive if you try to do it round one when he's fresh. Because you're the risk taker. Maybe I'll do that. You're the guy who's willing to do all the crazy stuff. Maybe I'll do that. Keep talking, Mike, and maybe I'll just get right in there with him.
SPEAKER_00: Corey, do you think that Corey, there is a possibility this match do not go to strap? I'm fine with that. I'm totally fine with that. He's the one running the strap, not me. No, no, no. I am just saying that Tobias' chance was without the strap. Once he went to strap, it was dominance by Corey. So my guess is that...
SPEAKER_00: Tobias has better hand grip than you have. So I kind of expect this match to go to strap. And then you're going to face the strap performance. So, Corey, not the without strap one. I don't have a preference. The strap with Tobias made it a lot easier to contain the speed. I mean, unless Devin's turned into something I'm not aware of, I don't think the speed is going to be.
SPEAKER_01: variable here do you think you're faster than me corey uh i don't necessarily think i'm faster than you know it's um you know it's it it it's hard for me uh a ton of respect for devin it's hard for me to sit here and and say anything disrespectful it is i'll be honest
SPEAKER_03: I truly believe. I love you, Corey. You're a great dude. You're a great dude. We're going to have a big fight, you and me. I'm going to try to rub your face in a bunch of shit. And then we'll be buddies afterwards. It's all good. But I'm going to beat you very badly. 100%. But I am ready for a fight. That's all I want. I hope so. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I hope so. You know, it's very important to stay calm, Corey, not get all worked up. Yeah. We'll be in that fight. You know, don't start breathing heavy too early. I breathe heavy all day long. What are you talking about? You know, I think this is good for hydration, eh? I've realized only poor people drink water.
SPEAKER_03: is that a bronze secret is that the 300 plus dot i can't believe how fat i've gotten seriously it's it's disgusting i look at myself in a picture and i'm like what happened to me man i was like a lean mean fighting machine i'm super heavyweight corey i might weigh more than you by the time this match starts seriously
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm excited. I'm excited for the whole card, but seriously, Corey, I am looking forward to our match. I, uh, I do think I'm going to surprise you. I do. I think that, uh, you know, I talk a lot of shit, but I do think that there's, there's something that comes out of me on game day. And that's something you haven't felt, you know, we are buddies and we've been nice to each other on practice tables, but now's our chance to get mean, you know?
SPEAKER_03: That's a different level of competition. One, it's my favorite. I'm glad I get to fight you, but buddy, I'm coming to rip your teeth out, seriously. I think I can blast you. I think I can blast you. I don't think you can hold on to me. I think you're going to find that out. And I think even with the strap on, you don't pin me. You don't pin me. And it just gets worse, worse and worse and worse from start to finish until, seriously, I have you a puddle.
SPEAKER_03: And I love it and I'm happy and I'll see how much energy you got. Did you hear my story about riding farm animals the other day? They gave me about two minutes, two minutes. I very, very much believe we've lived very different lives. Obviously you've done amazing things. I deeply.
SPEAKER_03: share some similar, uh, opinions, uh, win or lose. I'm going to take a piece of you. I hope you do. I will be happy if you take all of it. I will be happy if you kill me on that stage. I give you permission. I will tell my kids that Corey West kills me at the arm wrestling table. He's now your best buddy. He's your best buddy.
SPEAKER_03: But dude, I have the heart attack medicine ready. Seriously. I do cardio now. I'm on a pedal bike. No you don't. Once a day. Two times a day. Every day. Jody will tell you. She'll tell you. She'll tell you I'm in, even though, even though I have a layer of fat now, best shape of my life. Yeah. Best shape of my life. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Devon, here, Kamil Jablonski says, no one will save you, Devon, from me. Ask that guy to count to three. Find out where it starts. Listen, I used to make fun of Dave. I used to say that Dave was the dumbest guy. Then Dennis is the dumbest guy. Kamil is actually the dumbest guy in our wrestling. Actually the stupidest. Will you ever pull him, Devon?
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah i pulled him i pulled him and if you knew the details of how i pulled him you'd be like devin you did good you did pretty good there if you actually knew let me tell you we have a destiny i know don't worry i'm going to teach this guy many lessons okay can i can i tell you my opinion
SPEAKER_00: Of course. Because you said that if I knew this story, I would just say that you did well. I just can't think anything any worse than that one. So that is why I don't think that... My rock bottom is very, very low. You have no idea the depth with the gun. He pulled Cody, right? Okay. I think that I know your thing that you pulled
SPEAKER_00: in a row. That has very little to do with it. Very little to do with it. You pull Gennady, and then you pull Dave Chaffee, and then you pull Hermes, and then you pull Dennis, and then you pull Georgi Svetko, and then I think you decided to take a break for Levan match before you start preparation. There was not a lot of time there, but yeah, that was that time, and that was during that period, wasn't it? Yeah, one month after that. Terrible. Terrible dark period. Terribly terrible period.
SPEAKER_03: Mark period. We can't, we can't take away. We need to give him that win, right? Listen, of course I would never take a win from anybody. I'll just tell him that he needs to learn how to count. Cause he's, cause he's an absolute basic student. Like really like the guy, the way he speaks, I'm telling you when I pull him, when I do, it's not going to be the same. It's not.
SPEAKER_00: It will be a tough match. You better be good because the guy, I saw him. I know exactly. When I touch somebody, I know, I know how good Camille is. I know a hundred percent how good he is. He may become even number one, you know, just set him with Vitaly, three months later, you can't be a hundred percent sure that Vitaly is going to win that match. It can go either way, you know, just he may beat Morozov as well. I don't know. I don't know. He's strong, but I don't know. Morozov will be more difficult for him. Morozov?
SPEAKER_00: will be more difficult if Morozov gets healthy again. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so it's good. Proving Astrologer says Devon shouldn't pull that nobody again until Devon is the champ and Kamil earns a title shot. No, no. I'll get him. He's on the path. For sure he's on the path. And then calling him nobody? Uh-uh. You are mistaken, my friend. Kamil with left arm is one of the few best as of now.
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so, Michael, so if you're not here, that is the biggest reason I wanted you to be here, is because I knew that Corey cannot match Devin. In fact, nobody can match, but maybe you could balance, but yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's really, there's not a lot. If Devin is as confident as he says he is, he's going to come in and he's going to put on a show, as usual. I just, I hope he is, because I truly think Corey will be in his best form ever, and I think Corey...
SPEAKER_02: is a very, very strong human being. If you cannot dismantle what he is early, he can be a handful for a lot of people. I truly think he's going to be the strongest he's ever been. I really believe that. I will come in. I'll give myself Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday off. You might as well just come here first, hang out with me a little bit, go ahead and do some really hard training up until Thursday, and then pull a card.
SPEAKER_03: Bad idea. You know what I would say? We can all have all kinds of fun. Yeah. Yeah. I am down for some good training. Like on Saturday, the 29th of March. Yeah. It's listen, if I can't just show up and beat this guy, I got no business beating Camille. I got no business beating Vitaly. I need to be able to just show up and beat you.
SPEAKER_03: where do you rank corey where do you rank corey in in the world left-handed who do you think top of north america top of north america number one in north america but we don't know exactly but outside of top five in my opinion the the the end of the end of the rankings gets messy like the end it's just it's it's not super it's hard to maintain them and i think that there's probably people in the top 10 that corey can beat
SPEAKER_03: um the match with tobias was real close real close and i think that there's probably like a wagner i think he can beat wagner it's wagner wagner just got bumped up wagner's currently sitting at 10th because vitaly knocked corey off the list because bet halley wasn't corey was telling me that's what it was right so wagner's still on the list yeah right so i think we can beat wagner personally me too and i love wagner who's nine who's nine
SPEAKER_00: I haven't looked at it in a while. Listen, right now the rankings are like 80% correct, but not 100%. I'm not saying this guy should be out, this guy should be in, but unless we give everyone a chance, but also styles make matches and then the ranking can change.
SPEAKER_00: Like one guy may beat Kamil, Kamil may beat Vitaly, Vitaly may beat that guy. What is the latest of the matches, Nathan? You understand? Like for example, Prokop should beat Alain Zolaev, Alain Zolaev beat Artur Makarov, Artur Makarov beat Mindaugas, Mindaugas beat Daniel Prokop. Did you beat Artur Makarov? Alain Zolaev beat him.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, Alain Zola. Yeah, Alain Zola may come also here. But we will see. I hope that the world becomes more peaceful. I've heard you're training again, Engin. Yeah, I am. And you know what? What motivates me? Like if I would put Mindagos, I kind of feel like you would really want him to win. You think you can beat Mindagos? I mean, you have seen me pulling him probably. Will you weigh in at a certain weight when you beat him?
SPEAKER_00: Right now, I'm 93 kilo. He says, stay as you are. But I said, I can make 85, but go to 70 kilo or something. Why don't you just weigh in 86 kilo? He's throwing stone to Ryan Bowman. I weigh 86 kilo. I'll meet you there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Real quick, real quick. Who do you want to face right-handed, Corey?
SPEAKER_02: Like, who would you like to pull right? Because I've been trying to tell people, I think your right is really close to being on par with your left. So I'd love to see who you can pull right-handed. Like, do y'all have any thoughts for anybody for Corey right-handed after he dismantles this little Canadian guy? Is that true that, Michael, Corey said that he's going to make Canada 51st state after this match? We're going to put up a wall, seriously. You guys. I've heard the rumor. I've heard the rumor.
SPEAKER_03: Hey, I do have to say, Devin, that when you mentioned that Canadians are tougher, colder winters, harsher, you have to deal with more difficulties and challenges than the Americans. I actually, I'm not so sure about that. I think the way to settle that is let's do a cold plunge. I'll represent America. You represent Canada. Whoever can stay in the longest, you'll be freezing water, totally freezing. That settles it.
SPEAKER_03: right but listen we'll do it after the event okay same time robert you probably heard that i just bailed out of a cold challenge no i didn't yes i can do anything we'll probably we'll probably stay in a long time i think we will have an ambulance ready okay we'll have balls on standby do you do that
SPEAKER_03: I mean, no, I know who I know who he is. I know you're the one that told me about him in the first place. I didn't even know who he was. Do you practice? Do you practice cold plunging?
SPEAKER_03: No, I've cold plunged. I haven't done it since I started working with East versus West and Ingun. I haven't cold plunged once, but I did go quite a few times. Started this or last year around summertime, did it for a while, and then I haven't been able to do it. Just no time. We do it in this house. Not me. Jody and Auden are in the ice like all the time.
SPEAKER_03: You can tag me in, so it can be you and I, Robert. Auden just went down to the river where there's ice on it, and he was swimming around the river yesterday. Nice. Nice. Well, it's got to be me and you, buddy. Me and you. Yeah, no problem, Robert. Listen, let's make it interesting. Okay. Was that Betty? Well, something. Let's make it interesting. Yeah, yeah, something. Now, also, one last thing, though.
SPEAKER_00: with, with John, you know, one of the, one of the reasons people think that he's the goat is because he will go after his opponent in their strength to start with. And you mentioned you might do that with Corey. Um, you know, that to me, listen, listen, listen, since he became Canada versus us, Robert is losing his, his, uh, objective, uh, stance and put him in trap down.
SPEAKER_03: That's okay. I love it. Listen, I'm used to hanging. I'm really used to three on ones these days. So four on one, nothing, nothing new. Three on one wasn't enough. Let's make it four on one. Let's make it four. Yes. Yeah. Uh, look at, look at, um, starting, starting in Corey's power.
SPEAKER_03: there is a difference between john bersink there's a difference between me there's a difference between all of us we all have our own certain way for me it's not so much about bravery out the gates for me it's about winning you know this is this is what i i'm about so i'm not gonna charge right at you in in a hook it's not what i do it's not what i will beat you much worse than john ever does but i won't meet you the way john does
SPEAKER_03: But you said you might do it. You said you might. Listen, one side, no. One side, I'm not going to just roll up and hook him. This guy's a gorilla, seriously. Okay? It's like riding a bull. Do you headbutt the bull? No, you jump on the bull's back. Okay? I know what Corey West is. I'm not Corey West. I'm a better arm wrestler than him. That's why I'm going to win. It's not because I'm going to just come up on 450-pound Corey West and throw him in a hook.
SPEAKER_03: You know, and John Brzenk, how did John Brzenk beat Corey West? I know exactly how. I watched that match many times. You should have beat him, Corey. You should have beat John Brzenk. But he, and he didn't meet you at the gates. He did not. Not when he beat you. You chased him. You chased him and you held on to him in some horribly unwise positions. And then he made you pay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Then he met you at the gates, but he learned from that, but he learned people never learn Robert. They never learned. Not until they take a ton of ketamine. Isn't that right? Mike ketamine helps load up on that ketamine. You get a little bit further, just a little bit. Hey, Corey, you should do some ketamine before the match. Like Thursday, I'll set you up with the clinic in Dallas.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah. Unfortunately, I have to work until right before we leave. Me too, buddy. Right here. Right here. I got to work. I know. It's exciting. It's exciting. Yeah. All right, Devin, who do you want to see Corey pull right-handed? Because you felt him right-handed too. Yeah. I want to pull Dave. You know what's an interesting one? What's a real interesting one? Let's hear it.
SPEAKER_03: really interesting and you're gonna have to get in good shape either either now this is the reach for you buddy but if you're going full time and you train you train hard either camille or jerry
SPEAKER_02: I like his chances, honestly. Like, that's who I was going to say out the gate was Camille because I've heard Camille on here. Camille or Jerry. Right-handed Camille. Corey is not the same. Corey's left and right are different. They're just different arms entirely. And Corey has no problems right-handed just getting in there and getting nasty. I love both those guys. I love both those matches. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Maybe Camille versus Corey.
SPEAKER_00: comedy comedy says that he was one against three when he beat devon but um i don't know about this see one and three he's doing good the actual number is zero but no no he he meant to probably the referees i know what he meant i know what he meant super chat robert excited for east versus west 17 let robert know i said hello and there is one more
SPEAKER_00: Who said that? Troy. Oh, Troy Tuller. Yeah. In my opinion, Kamil hasn't earned the right to call Devon out over and over again. Devon is a former world number one and should be the one that says Kamil's name when Devon wants another shot. People can do whatever they want. Who am I to tell anybody what they're supposed to do? But, Kamil,
SPEAKER_03: You're a bit slow, buddy. Don't worry. Don't worry. I will come to you. Just relax a little bit, Camille. I know Camille is obviously watching.
SPEAKER_00: And Camille learned to count to three from zero. I heard Camille's going to be in Arlington. Is that true? Is he going to be in Arlington? He was going to be. He was going to pull Jerry, but Jerry, as you know, he lost his father. I thought he still might be coming. And the match was canceled, yeah. And Camille a few times wanted me to announce this because people were expecting this match to happen. And Camille told to his fans that he was going to pull him.
SPEAKER_00: He doesn't want to look bad. It has nothing to do with Kamil. He has to match what's set. Right, right. Sometimes, you know, life is more important than, you know. Of course, of course. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so, I mean, anyway, so this is great. It's great. I think that, I don't know, when I look at Corey, I'm just so curious, you know, and I asked him, he said, no, but if he's intimidated or not, not many people are not intimidated by Devon's, this type of strategies, but Corey, you look around. It's not a strategy, Engin. It's not a strategy. It's just, it's a reality that he's scared of.
SPEAKER_03: It's not that there's some magic. There's no magic involved. Okay, who are the athletes that were not scared against you? Gennady. Gennady mentally is invincible. Really. Gennady, that's his greatest gift. Gennady's head is just... How about Levan? Was Levan? Yes, of course. Levan is so confident. Levan is a fighter. Now, I'll tell you,
SPEAKER_03: Levon and Gennady, they're both mentally strong. Gennady is completely insane, really, I think. I think it's wonderful. But yeah, Levon is, yeah, both those guys super mentally strong. But... Have you always been strong, Devon? No. Or sometimes you look brave, braver than how you look?
SPEAKER_03: You force yourself and then you force yourself to be brave. Um, maybe at times when it's insurmountable, when something is insurmountable, like when it's actually impossible, but there is no way to avoid it. Sort of like the same way, like when you have a rat in a cage, um, the rat can't run away.
SPEAKER_03: It has to fight. It has to. You have no other choice. But you put yourself into that situation, and then later there is no way to go out, and then you have only one choice. That is to be brave, right? It is your only choice. When you're in a fight, you must be brave. Always. Always. But sometimes you're not certain. You're not. But that doesn't matter.
SPEAKER_03: That doesn't matter. You have to, even in loss, you have to continue to fight, you know, and that's something, you know, a lot of things piss me off. The things that really piss me off the most are when people talk about my children, you know, when people talk about my children, nothing makes me more angry. Uh, you know, and when my children are, are criticized for strength, Oh, nothing makes me more angry. Um,
SPEAKER_03: yeah you know you need to show bravery in a fight you get angry because of it is not because i wish the best for people i wish them strength i wish them empowerment and when people use any form of leadership to make people weaker it disgusts me it disgusts me so when i see people giving criticism
SPEAKER_03: to act a way that makes them weaker. It disgusts me. And when it's my child, I take it personally. I'm like disgusted. Yeah. So there's so many stupid people out there that I want to just smash now, just smash. And, um, I'm going to, I'm going to harness that. I think a little bit, I think it's going to be a good thing for me today. Do they do that because to hurt you or hurt them?
SPEAKER_03: I think that it's, there's many traits to being a human being. You know, we think of positive traits, but negative traits are part of what it is to be human also. And I think a lot of times people, people, people project negativity, negativity, and I hate it. I hate it.
SPEAKER_00: I want to destroy those people. I want to destroy them. And with me, I'm not too worried. People have to say to me, I'm 49. It's no problem. I don't know how we got here. Obviously, it's on my mind. I think it is, yeah. It is the path you choose is what I believe. I believe that you are famous not only because you are missing abilities, but because you're
SPEAKER_00: challenging personality. And I think that you have a lot of people likes you and a lot of people that don't like you. And then I think that is one of the opportunity for them to show you how they feel about you. That, that, that, that is, I think my opinion. Yeah. It is a polarizing line at the front, at the front, when you're, when you're, when you're chasing and you're willing to make mistakes.
SPEAKER_03: It's a polarizing place to live. When you give yourself permission to just say what you think and do what you wish and believe that you are innocent, it can be messy sometimes, you know, but that's what being brave is all about. Um, I think a lot about the number zero. I think a lot about the number zero about how you can, you can not divide it. It's impossible. It's impossible.
SPEAKER_03: And as you approach it mathematically from the positive side and the negative side, it goes different directions. So it's impossible to find what it is. And, and I think that it's super polarizing. I think that that is where, when you look at the whole world and you become as polarizing as possible, which is, which is zero and zero is, is found by flow state. It's found by just completely letting yourself go and,
SPEAKER_03: That's where I love to be. And that's where I'm going to be with you, Corey and Arlington. I'll be fucking wild. I'll be wild with you, man. And I don't think that you, I think you're a number. I think you're like a seven or six. I'm going to cut you up. I'm going to cut you up into a million little pieces. You know, I I'm going to, I'm going to own you on the table.
SPEAKER_00: I take every piece of you. Every piece. And I won't have mercy. You'll have to quit. Corey, Corey, Corey, this speech, does it make you more aggressive or more? Like if somebody was talking like this to me, I would become more aggressive. I remember when
SPEAKER_00: no why would make you more aggressive because i just wanna i would want this person to eat his walls you know whenever he says this i just can't wait i mean what would that mean what would that mean to you what would that make you mean that was said that he was gonna tired me and hold me from here and beat me and then whenever i heard this and i just imagined him doing this in istanbul front of my people
SPEAKER_00: And I hit him as I never hit anyone else. I hit him so bad that, I mean, he was just smashed to the pin pad, you know, because he made me so aggressive because I didn't want what he said to me to happen. So it made me aggressive that I just wanted to break his arm, you know. So I'm just curious if Corey feels like, like, no, this can't happen. So let me make him eat his words at the table or he is like, oh, can he really do that to me? Oh, can he really?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, very difficult question. To who? Ask it to all you. Okay, go ahead. Because I feel like I'm really getting closer. But what do you guys think lies in a metaphorical heaven or hell? What is your day consist of?
SPEAKER_00: Okay, my English is not good. Can somebody explain? What do you do every day in heaven? In heaven? We will find out. You don't know? Do you have any idea? I mean, for sure, we won't be as dirty as we are here. What about in hell? Hell is...
SPEAKER_03: I think in my perception anyway, in heaven, I think we're helping people. We're building people. And in hell, we're doing the opposite. We're hurting people. People are hurting. I mean, it's the opposite. Do you think you get to fight all day? In heaven or in hell? Either one.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think there'd be so much fighting in heaven. I think it'd be more helping building. I think there'd be more fighting in hell. Do you think that some people fight in heaven? Uh, I would say it would be more of a exception than the rule if it did happen. Are you talking about arm wrestling in heaven?
SPEAKER_01: Devin, is that where you're going? I'm going to kick your ass in Arlington. You don't got to wait till heaven. You don't got to wait that long, buddy. Don't you worry. Don't you worry. I think, I think heaven is, is every, I think it's peace. And if arm wrestling and war is peace for you, then I think that that's what you'll have in heaven. Yes. I think hell is a struggle and constant.
SPEAKER_00: hatred or evil. Have any of you had dreams before? Jody's giving me the eye. I'm not allowed to talk about this stuff. Let's change the topic, shall we? Yeah, I just want to say something. When I was very little, I didn't know about gravity and the roundness of the Earth. I was hoping that somebody put some barrier to the edge
SPEAKER_00: so we wouldn't fall down. I was thinking that it has to have an end, but I really didn't think that there was, like Earth was round and like ball, and then there was gravity. We were like, I imagined something, but I found out when I grew up, I found out something. So what I'm just saying, I don't think that, like in this life, we found ourselves in this life with whatever was programmed for us.
SPEAKER_00: And so for other side, I don't think that we know what is waiting for us. I know one represents the happiness and pureness. The other one is the punishment for we hurting each other on this earth. So that is my take. There is a super chat. Logan, Mithiak, Devon, what chance does Hermes have against Levan? You know, it's very interesting to me.
SPEAKER_03: All these now it's, it's interesting that it's taken since 2021 really. So it's 2025. Now it's 2021. We're starting to have multiple repeats. Like Michael's not faced LaVon. I've faced him twice. Um, Hermes is going to face him again. Looks like Vitaly might have a shot again.
SPEAKER_03: So it looks like a lot of the top guys are now having their second and even sometimes maybe third events upcoming. And, and what has happened is the field is being risen. Like all the guys who touch it, we have information. We have information of, of, of, of how far it is, you know, and, and I am sure.
SPEAKER_03: that Ermes has that information, and he remembers what he felt, and he is going to close something. Ermes did great his first time. He did really, really good. I know there's talks about LeVon wasn't in his best shape, whatever. The fact is, Ermes did really well. And Ermes has dedicated himself. It's going to be harder for LeVon. We have all these guys taking a run at LeVon.
SPEAKER_03: LeVon stands alone. You know, it's hard to defend the world title. He's already done it since arguably 2017. It's like eight years. He's undefeated, you know, um, in my books, LeVon is already the greatest. Okay. And my books, nobody that I'm aware of has held the super heavyweight crown for eight years, undefeated, especially in this era. Um, and.
SPEAKER_03: I just think that it's going to get harder for him. As great as he is, it's going to get harder. And Ermias, I tell you, look, LeVon's a monster. But it's going to get harder and harder and harder. I'm real excited. I think Ermias is going to dedicate. I think he's going to do everything right. You get a chance at LeVon, you change your life. You get a chance at the number one super heavyweight spot in the world in the arm wrestling, East versus West era. Like, man, people go right to the wall for that.
SPEAKER_00: Yep, yep, yep. And it is like scary, you know, as Neil Pickup described, this is like Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park. And yeah, it is like one of the biggest reason I don't want to make a comeback because I kind of feel that like I lost that, you know, like it's just already, you know, too far to reach to the top. But would you be willing to try?
SPEAKER_00: Yes. Yes. That's all that ever matters. Yeah. Yeah. The only problem is that they help problems. Then when you also know that the price that you were paying some years ago, the price that you need to pay right now is not the same price. I am guessing for me, not the same price, much heavier price, much heavier, much heavier price. Yeah. Much heavier price. Yeah. But if you love something, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: what else is there i i'm sacrificed i sacrificed already a few years because i put on the scale which one is more important i to our muscle helps the sport but i to do this is more important so that that was much heavier so i had to focus on this one now robert getting old texter got involved and i i'm already starting a little bit if the health is okay i i will i will i will try to do my best but this is still the uh priority can you do you know
SPEAKER_03: Go ahead. Do you know in martial arts, do you know about martial arts belts, Engin? Martial arts belts? Belts, yeah. Yeah, yeah, the belt, black belt. Yeah, do you know about like how you get like the really high dance, how you get the really high like eighth, ninth, tenth degree belts? Do you know how you do that? I mean, like we had over here, I did Taekwondo, we had some exams, you know. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But you know how you get the big black belts, like the really high ones? You tell me. You bring people together. You have big events. Yes. Oh, I didn't know that. I didn't know that. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, yeah, anyways, I, I, I think that everything is going very well. And the one thing I, whenever I talk with, uh, let's talk about that a little bit and I will read a few super chats, but when I talk with, um, I want you to answer this, uh, when I talk, did you watch Michael, the, the podcast I had with Levan or not? I haven't watched it yet. I'm sorry. Yeah. During that podcast, I said that one was like big and.
SPEAKER_00: do you think that I asked to Levan, like Devon, we didn't like, because when Devon pulled Hermes, when Devon pulled Levan, he was around like 120 kilo. He was about 265, 260 around there. And now we saw like a really big one. And I said, do you think that this version of Devon, like more dangerous for you? And he didn't think that,
SPEAKER_00: He's not sure that that was the case. He said that he needed to see the weights that Devon is lifting to know that he was stronger than before. First, let me ask you, Michael, do you agree with it? And then let's ask Devon what is the truth.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what Devin is today, but I think the Devin we saw in Georgia is the strongest Devin we've ever seen. With intentions of continually getting stronger. I mean, his commitment to chasing that super heavyweight crown is...
SPEAKER_02: is well noted, right? We all know what he's wanna do. And I think Devin's frame is enormous and he has the potential to even get bigger. I mean, I think it's not unrealistic for us to see a 330, 340 pound Devin Larratt within the next 12 to 18 months. If that exists, I feel like that's a problem.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but do you, so you are saying that he sure was, even though he didn't show us the ways that he is lifting? To me, that is not the only way to prove that you are strong. I thought his performance versus Gennady was exceptional. You know what I'm saying? I mean, I felt like there was a gap. I just thought he made it look interesting, is what my opinion was. Now, that's just how I viewed the match. Whether that's accurate or not, that's just what I saw. Yeah. I think that version of Devin that we just saw is...
SPEAKER_02: is significantly stronger when i say significantly i don't because once you get to a certain level of strength significantly may only be three or four percent but that's significant at this level and i do believe that that's the devon we saw okay then what what do you what is your answer for that i guess i'd say three things the first thing is i'd say that was the strongest
SPEAKER_03: I believe I'd ever been. And what leads me to believe that is all my training leading up to it, which I'll talk about just a tiny bit, but on the day, like, even if you think that Gennady was less and quite honestly, he probably was a little bit. I had the ability to flash pin him anytime I wanted, you know, I showed him in the rounds and he stopped you. You could pin him real quick.
SPEAKER_03: I, I brought him to the pin pad without a strap, held him in a hook so he couldn't slip out until he quit. Okay. I mean, to me, to me, I thought it was obvious, but you know, um, you know, round one, I smoked him in a hook round two. I made him quit round three. I probably, oh, sorry. Round four actually. Um, cause the first round, I mean, whatever, but, um, the, the, the third pin, I pinned them.
SPEAKER_03: I think almost quicker than I pinned almost anybody, maybe except for John. And then the last round got a little bit interesting where I let out a lot of rope to really let him get in there. But I know that the weights that I was lifting, the way I felt on the table, the two-handed work that I'd done, I certainly haven't been this strong in a very long time.
SPEAKER_00: Ever is always a question, but in a very long time, measurably. So I don't know. I think it was the best version of me, actually. I really do. So you are saying, what I understand that you, the reason that we all believe that you should pull Levan third time is that there are not many people that accept Hermes.
SPEAKER_00: Like nobody really stops this guy. And you did on round one. But what I realized that you probably came to a conclusion that you need to be strong, stronger to, I mean, not like 120 kilo you were before, but like you need to come close to his strength level to make sure that you're, I realized that both matches that you pull against him, first rounds,
SPEAKER_00: you got a little bit damaged, you know. Yeah, maybe even the second round when you tore your bicep, maybe there was something happened on the round one that that's why you went that way. Maybe. Maybe because, I mean, you sometimes get a little bit damaged and then the real thing happens on the next one. You get damaged. And then also in Istanbul, the round one, the match stopped after the other rounds.
SPEAKER_00: You didn't resist. So maybe, maybe that round one that really damages you. So maybe you need to be stronger to make your endurance become effective. If you are not strong enough to, you know, like continue going head to head with him, then I don't think the endurance will play any role. The real power needs to be very close. But you probably know better. You are the one who pulled against him twice.
SPEAKER_03: Arm wrestling is combative strength. No question about it. And there's a certain level that you have to, yeah, yeah. You need to be super strong. You want to be a super heavyweight arm wrestler? You need to be super, super strong. Yeah. Yeah, the other day, I'm planning to make it pound for pound best.
SPEAKER_00: And I asked a lot of people's opinion when I asked to, because a lot of people will also think that way and this way. And I had the answers different way, but Levan thinks that you are the pound for pound best. Even the question was about his countrymen, but he believes that it's you. It's a very difficult question. Pound for pound best is a very hypothetical thing. I mean, you can look for dominance in category.
SPEAKER_03: And, and that's, and that's, it's hard to compare people, right? It's hard. Um, I think that the, the, the most competitive classes are the ones with the most people in them. I'd say that generally the pound for pound champions are typically found in the, in the lower divisions where there's more people, where there's more, more to fight, you know, um, it's, it's easy to look great and awesome when you're, when you are bigger and stronger, but pound for pound has a heavy.
SPEAKER_03: heavy emphasis on on technical understanding and technical greatness and you know and then and then the whole thing gets really messed up when you look at freaks like to me oleg zok in his prime
SPEAKER_03: is beating everybody by miles. Like, I don't think pound for pound at, you know, 80 kilo, a healthy Oleg Zak, probably coming in at number two in the world behind Denis, you know, for quite a period. And maybe... Not really, though. Not really. Like, people who has very good, like Matushenko always, who can beat him, I think... You think? When he was really good?
SPEAKER_00: He was super good. He was the best pound for pound, no doubt. But there are some guys that like, for example, in 2015,
SPEAKER_00: Like, I flashed Mazgan Shamiev at the WAF. 40 days later, Mazgan flashed in the same way, you know, Oleg Dzok. And then Mazgan had Asmonas, Mantas, Asmonas. They had like one and a half minute match. And even in the final, he gave 20 seconds match to Oleg Dzok. Yes, he was pound for pound best, but second to Denis.
SPEAKER_03: It depends, you know, some, some guys like Matushenko would always hook him and beat him, you know, like, but there's a lot that I'm unaware of and, and you, you have that information, but still a guy like that.
SPEAKER_00: it's totally screws up the pound for pound you know like because yeah i agree right now he's second in my opinion after alijan but as of now the old oleg was different you know before but i think he's coming back the way that he beat daniel prokopchuk those that shows that he's coming back uh yeah yeah a lot right now is divided some people believe that samusha been winning like 10 more titles in his weight category and then some people says that yes samusha dominated his category while devon
SPEAKER_00: easily won 105 and then he won 115 and he's second in the super airway that is harder to to do it you know but um most of the people think that you are you you should be uh ranked number one now i'm fat so if you look today that pound for pound goes out the window pound for pound me at 105 yeah me at 300 i'm a bit fluffy
SPEAKER_00: No, but we can't judge you however you are. We need to judge. I will tell you something. Guys, real quick. I've got to get off here. I've got a St. Patrick's Day parade I have to go to. Thank you, Michael. God bless. Take care. I'm going to beat your boy. I'm going to beat him bad. I'm going to beat him real bad, Mike. Bring tissues for him. Bring tissues. See you guys. Bye-bye.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, my opinion that Devon, like until this King of the Table in East versus West, half of the world didn't really believe that you were one of the best in the world.
SPEAKER_00: And then I think that the most successful- I don't think it was half. I think a lot of people did. I think they knew. Yeah. I mean, nice maybe. Yeah. And then after that, after you start pulling regularly against these Eastern guys, I think that more than half of your career success is happening in the last three, four years, four years probably. And today, very, very hard. Let's see. Let's see how it will be.
SPEAKER_00: I think you, you, Hermes wants to pull you again at some point. And you want, you said that you want to give him a lesson that that will happen eventually as well. And then we will see. But first, first, this guy, Corey, you, what are you going to do to this guy? Corey, tell us. You know, you asked me earlier if I was, what did you say? Intimidated? Yeah. Yeah. I don't want that. If he beats you, I want him to beat you because he was better than you. I don't want you to have any.
SPEAKER_01: any like weakness in your, um, focus and everything, right? But you look better. So, I mean, I'm, I'm definitely not somebody that, that fair, that feels fears failure. Um, and again, you know, Devin said it earlier, you know, there's, there's definitely going to be a lot of takeaway. I don't think there's anything in the world, like pulling Devin Lorette on a big, on a big stage. And that's gonna,
SPEAKER_01: You know, win or lose, there's going to be a lot gained from that. I definitely feel like I'm coming in strong enough to win. I don't feel like if we were pulling right-handed, I'd be in the category right now, but I think left-handed, I'm there. I like my chances. You coming there to win? 100%. Okay, that's what I want to hear. So you are saying that that one is in?
SPEAKER_01: trouble and his mind games strategy didn't even work. He wasted his time. No different than what Devin said. I know Devin loves me. Me and Devin have a great relationship. He will get everything I've got as soon as the match starts. It won't have anything to do with anything and the second it's over we can go right back to being everything we were but he's going to get every ounce of me. Do you think
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that you have two minutes in you? Two minutes per round, two minutes, two minutes per round. Is that what you're asking? Not at all. Total, total time. Like, like when two minutes of last time goes off, do you just, do you just melt? Um, I like, I know you have good intentions, but what happens after two minutes?
SPEAKER_03: man i don't i don't know the answer to that i mean we're going to find out together i guess if it goes that long i mean i've been there many times i know what two minutes feels like two minutes i don't have any intentions of arm wrestling you that long right but what if it happens i'm gonna figure it out you know sorry but robert go ahead
SPEAKER_03: Oh, sorry. Just one quick. So, Corey, you said and Michael said you're the strongest you've ever been right now. How much stronger do you think you are in the weights, in the gym, measurable, than you were, say, in Atlantic City? Against Tobias, I was really good in that. I was really strong then. I'm probably, my weight is pretty similar. I was a few pounds heavier. I've
SPEAKER_01: whatever reason staying right around the 395 mark i've had a lot of left shoulder issues me and devin were actually supposed to pull about a year ago it was when him and camille pulled we were supposed to pull and i ended up having a slap tear in my left labrum and that's just continually gotten better and better and better and now to the point where i can put as much strain on it as i want in training and have no issues um weights wise i mean
SPEAKER_01: several percent i mean the weight moves easier than it's ever moved measurable i don't really have a great measurement for that i've got to get to where i do more of the things the micro movements and stuff like devin and them do but as far as gym lifts go my lips are so much bigger than what a weight stack can go that it's hard to really there's no single rep pr because i can take any full stack and do about anything i want with it with one hand
SPEAKER_03: Okay. No, that that's good. Cause Mike, Michael's told me a couple of times. I never did ask him, never thought to ask him how much stronger. Cause he said, Oh, Corey's stronger than has ever been because in your, you just answered, uh, because you're healthy now, uh, for the first time, you know, in, in a long time, you're totally healthy and you're, you're seeing some gains in the gym, although it may only be a few percent. Right. Is that what I heard? Yeah. I mean, we're all arm wrestlers. We've all been limited by pain before. Um, I would say.
SPEAKER_01: This is the first time in a long time that I've had none. No elbow pain, no shoulder pain, or nothing. OK. OK. Kuznich. Kuznich just saying. Are you going to post that video about breaking a lock? Are you going to post that video about lock breaking? Are you going to post it? I don't have it. So I lost that. I think Michael might have it. But I lost that phone at the lake. Yeah. Yeah, you want to post that video.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah i actually i actually asked michael for another copy of that because he he he sent me a copy of it but it was a little distorted the way he sent it so yeah that's a good idea that that people need to see that you're right evan that's that's an interesting thing you can do i feel like everybody can do it i don't feel like it's not interesting not everybody you can not everybody
SPEAKER_00: Let me read a few superchats before they get upset. Kiznish, I understand it is hard to quantify, but how far ahead percentage-wise do you think Levan is compared to all those chasing him, all the best guys? Armwrestling, the power is not really measurable. To say this guy is 10% better, you can be good about very key points.
SPEAKER_03: little bit more and then you may win the match. So that is not like pressing a side pressure machine, you know, but is there anyone who thinks differently? I think that Levant you can measure people different ways. You can you can measure their intelligence at the table, you can measure their stamina, you can measure and there's like levels to it. And I think when it comes down to structure, which is very measurable,
SPEAKER_03: Not anybody that I can think of at this time even has a structure, just a visible structure that resembles Lavon's. And then his intelligence is perfect. There's no problem. And so he has just such a capacity for greatness and he's disciplined. So you are punching up. Everyone is punching up.
SPEAKER_03: Um, so whether it's 10%, whether it's 20%, whether it's a couple levels, but the thing is, is when you punch up and you punch as hard as you can, you're aware that it's higher than that. I think that Ernie's had a, I think it's, I'll tell you once Ernie's rise and his pronation, um,
SPEAKER_03: are, are, are really good. And the thing is, is it's so long as those lifts are available for him on the table. And I think he's already proven that they are with Lavon. I think they match up well that he can execute his technique. He might've only been last time, 10%, 15% different. Maybe it was that close. So.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, Dino is saying Devon at 105 and 115, but with rehydration clouds. I am interested how he would perform then.
SPEAKER_00: Did he say me or Dennis? No, no, it's Devon. He says that like without water loss, you know, that cuts, you know, like how would you perform if you actually were at that weight? He's saying, but I don't know if necessary to discuss about this because we have the weigh-in time, we have the competition time, like, and then it's same for everyone. Yeah, I understand some people knows.
SPEAKER_00: how to lose weight while some people don't do those kind of things. But I don't see anything against this, you know, because right from the beginning of the East versus West, we always did the weigh-in day before the event. And if an athlete knows how to cut the weight, it doesn't matter if it is wrestling or boxing or UFC. I mean, I don't think there's anything illegal. Have you guys ever heard something like that? People say that you cannot lose water or something to make weight?
SPEAKER_03: I think that different federations have different timings and different things, but I think that when you set the rules, that's the standard and everybody plays the entire game. So we're all under the same rules. Long as there's that understanding, look at the rules could be changed, but, um, I think this is working just fine. Obviously I do. I mean, I, I know how to do it. It's.
SPEAKER_03: To me, I just accept it as part of the game. Rules could be changed. I would adapt. If the rules were changed, you know, there's ways to rehydrate quickly, really. I mean, but you'd be surprised at how fast you can regain strength.
SPEAKER_03: you didn't have to lose so much weight when you won 115 kilos or no i didn't yeah i didn't have to sauna i didn't take diuretics i didn't even take a hot bath you know i walked down glycogen water manipulation salt manipulation it was perfect you know no problem i was eating the day before the weigh-in um talking about when you pulled prudnik
SPEAKER_03: Oh, Prudnik, no. No, no, for 115, you didn't have to water cut 115. No, 115, 115. Yeah, 105 is a good one. 115, that's pretty much, I can be 115 anytime. You know, that's... 115, you can do it, yeah, very easily. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so, Corey, tell him what you're going to do to him, please. Corey, you don't have to listen to him. You don't have to listen to him, Corey. You can just be like,
SPEAKER_03: You can just be. It's okay, Devin. I know it's going to be fun. Don't worry, buddy. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll take good care of you. He already told me that after I crush him, we can still be friends. Oh, okay. He told you this privately or now? Privately? I tell everybody. I tell everybody. Listen, I'm going to destroy you and then don't worry. Don't worry. Don't take it too personally.
SPEAKER_03: Don't take it too personally. You know, I'm going to try to hurt you, Corey. I'm going to try because I want you to do the same to me. So I will honor you in this fashion. I will purposefully hurt you. Thank you. Thank you for playing rough. Big buddy. The only way that this doesn't happen is only like, if you can be tougher, I had a question. I remembered my question.
SPEAKER_03: You know, there's a lot of people who face me and they think if the match stops, I'll quit, I'll be smart, and I'll have another shot. Are you familiar with this thought? I don't even know the rule set for this. Is it running fouls? No. You should know the rules. Same as king of the table in the city, Corey. Corey, only thing you need to do is just... But there's a slight change, isn't there?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, the referee's grip, yeah. Because it takes so long, yeah, referee's grip, yeah. Yeah, I mean, in fact, I was offered to do a direct strap, but direct strap changes the outcome of the match. Like we saw, like, some matches, like you versus John in 2015, if those matches were in strap, looks like you would have won. The base of arm wrestling is still no strap.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, there is something. Also, it doesn't always save time. Like, Aligen versus Matushenko, all rounds. Right. No, you don't have the right to a strap. You can slip. Yeah, you can slip or you can agree.
SPEAKER_00: Tatashins and Kanai, all seven rounds, I think it was the 4-3 or what was it? Or 3-2. Like, they agreed to go to Strap, you know. I pulled Artur Makaro, we agreed. I pulled Mindagos, we agreed. We all agreed to go to Strap. I think the older we get, it is harder to have the grip, you know, I think. But maybe you're doing good, you know. Have you thought about quitting? Quitting? Quitting?
SPEAKER_01: Tori. Oh. Have you thought about it? Seriously, has it crossed your mind? I mean, you're the first one to bring it up. I'm just curious if you've thought about it. I'm just curious if you've thought about it or if Michael's been like, yo, if Devin stops, you gotta quit. No, the only things I've been talking about, I gotta remember not to, if you got your elbow up, I gotta get my elbow, I gotta figure out how to cheat with you. That's the only thing I'm worried about. Cheat?
SPEAKER_01: You're not on that boat, are you? You're not on that team, are you? I just got to not get outsmarted. Okay, but you're just going to be like Dennis and come up there real friendly, right? I mean, I guess. You're not going to start the fight, are you? We can hug before. I don't care what we do. Okay, so real friendly. Real friendly, just come to the table. Real friendly. Right, but what happens if I stop you? Have you thought about it? Not even a little bit.
SPEAKER_03: You haven't. Can I help you? Help me what? You should think about it over the next couple days. Have you thought about what if it doesn't stop? I think about everything. I think about everything, yeah. But have you thought about it? Really, if you haven't, I'd be surprised. I think you'd think about everything.
SPEAKER_03: Corey, you don't have this option if the match stops? Like somewhere here? You've thought about the match, right, Corey? We have a match. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? Stay real strong right here. Okay, so I'm just curious because it really tells me a lot about people. Most people are like full of bravado.
SPEAKER_03: and they say i'll never quit are you one of those people i guess we'll figure out together so you so you don't want to tell me but you have thought about it i guess just now when you brought it up no but you must have thought about it before right not even a little bit oh come on now you thought about this match
SPEAKER_00: Corey, just ignore him. He wants you to think what he wants you to think. No, Engin, Engin. You know what I watch right now? I watch like Freddy Krueger, Elm Street. Listen, Engin, I acknowledge that you are a ninth degree black belt. And you teach people. You are teaching people. I am teaching Corey. You are putting...
SPEAKER_03: Like, wow, this is like a horror movie. He hasn't thought about it. He has a match coming up. He needs to think. Hang on. He obviously needs to think about it. Corey, what did you think about if I stop you, Corey? This is like a horror movie. Don't you think, Robert? Oh, stop. I'm just trying to tell. Look, we're talking about arm wrestling here. Yes, yes. No, no. It makes it big fun. What happens if I talk to him? What happens if I talk to him? What happens if you... What happens if the match stops, Corey?
SPEAKER_03: All I keep thinking about is how I was, I was just a kid, not that long ago, watching y'all on TV. And now your name's wrapped there under Travis's. And I'm just going to put a check right beside it. Whenever I think about riding pigs in the summertime, I keep thinking about riding pigs, jumping on, twisting their ears, listening to squeal and all the other pigs come running. Michael are back in the corner coming at me. I'll be twisting your ear up there.
SPEAKER_01: Right down there in Texas. That's what I think about. That's why. And they gave me two minutes, Corey. They gave me two minutes, two minutes of good times. You know, this, this really, this really wise guy said something on a podcast. One time he said, uh, he said, well, we're all climbing. Corey West is climbing faster.
SPEAKER_03: i'm way up here i'm way up here buddy i welcome you and i see you coming i see you coming a mile away buddy a mile away you're hard to miss your hand is still a bit too small just a bit too small you're big dude i'm gonna i'm gonna rip those little fingers of yours right off
SPEAKER_03: You get nowhere with me, you know, and you think your arm is so strong because I haven't been training. The word out there is that I'm weak. Those, those lifts are coming. Guess what? I don't think I am five pounds off my right now. Five pounds. Just think about that. Only five. Now it might even pass my right. If things keep going the way they are.
SPEAKER_00: Well, OK, that was good. That was good. Good challenge. And I see I'm happy that he is not doing any backstab and he is just what you were going to say. You're going to you're going to mark his name after Travis. You're going to work. That is your next victim. I was just a fan a few years ago just watching these guys, you know. Yeah. Now he will become your victim.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I love you, Corey West. I'm so happy you're bringing the heat buddy. Really? It means so much more. Yeah. How old are you now? How old are you? 34. Okay. So listen, so listen, Auden is 19 and I'm telling him like, I think when you're this age, you can beat this guy. I think you're this age when you can beat this guy. So you're 34. I'm 15 years. It's not going to be this time. I think you'll get me.
SPEAKER_03: not this time maybe when i'm 64. 50 years later you'll be 50 you'll be 49 you'll be about how old i am now about in 15 years from now i'll be 64. and you might get a fly like i might elbow foul off the back you know but i'd probably still match it up with you you know
SPEAKER_00: Corey, after this podcast now, is there anything negative, positive with your confidence or with your how to say? I carry pretty much the same. I'm excited. I can't wait. Okay. Diabolical Billy. Devon ain't gonna pin you, mate.
SPEAKER_00: He just has to wait more than 30 seconds. Corey's body will shut itself down like a cheap laptop with a crap battery. Another second and the blocks one twitch away from a blue screen of death. Oh.
SPEAKER_03: I wouldn't even say that these people are terrible. This diabolical Billy, he needs to be my script writer. Okay. This is, this is one of my favorite YouTubers, diabolical Billy, diabolical Billy. I hope, listen, diabolical Billy, if you can get to, if you can get down to
SPEAKER_03: to Dallas. If you can get down to Arlington, I want you in my corner between rounds. And I want you to tell me the most vile putrid thing you can come up with in your twisted brain and whisper it to me. And so I can share it with, with Corey. Cause I'm only so evil. I can only think of so many dark things. I need you. I need you. You know, Dino says, but what if Corey beats you there? Um,
SPEAKER_03: Look, if, if Corey beats me, I hope that the referee made like a, like $10 million. Okay. Like, like I hope that that referee and their entire family is well fed and taken care of and that at least it's made a lot of people happy and fed.
SPEAKER_03: Cause there's, there's no, there's no other way. I'm sorry about it. It's just that you'd have to steal it from me. No fight is going to beat me. It will have to be stolen, you know, in front of everybody, which is hard to do really hard to do. Okay. I don't think you're going to beat me, buddy. I don't, I don't, I love you, but I don't think you got a chance. I think I'm going to crack that little hand of yours round one. And I think I can even do it fast.
SPEAKER_03: I think I can take it right to the pin. I do. But I'd rather bleed you. I'd rather bleed you up. I'd rather let you bleed in the sun. I think you got more gas than people give you credit for. I do. I think you got at least a minute, Corey. You think you got a minute? Can you run for a minute? Or are you a 20-second guy? 20 seconds?
SPEAKER_03: Because there's divisions, you know? A lot of guys are 20, 25 second guys. You just got to keep going. Just don't give up. Just don't quit. Never quit.
SPEAKER_03: That means you should quit, Corey, when he's got you in a bad position. Robert, don't be telling him to quit. He's on your team. See, nobody believes in you, Corey. People are already telling you to quit. No, no. If you get in a bad position, you probably won't. But if you do, you need to not fight it. Go to the next round and beat him. Beat him quickly. Quit. Sorry, Devin. I know what you're doing. Sorry, Corey. I didn't know it was this bad.
SPEAKER_03: i knew they knew i could win oh my god i knew it was bad i didn't know it was this bad i'm sorry corey listen get michael listen don't even get michael michael's art get your wife she's the only one who believes in you that's it that's it no don't get michael's gonna tell you to quit everyone's gonna tell you your wife's the only one he's gonna tell you keep fighting that's it
SPEAKER_03: Only if he gets in a bad position. He probably won't. But if he does, remember, Corey, let that go. Go to the next round. Beat him fast. Just lay down, buddy. Nice and easy. Robert, you're already taking this as a U.S. versus Canada. You just can't stop yourself. I love having Robert on the other team. Robert on the other team is a blessing in disguise. No, no. Devin's being a little bit of a bully here. I've got to protect the...
SPEAKER_03: I got to protect Corey a little bit. Go ahead. Devin, are we going to the strap first match? Hey, is this a form of begging? Are you already begging me for something? You are so revealing. You know what? I didn't know. Let me tell you something. I was trying to get a game. Your loss of strength, your loss of strength without a strap is apparent. It's apparent. Devin.
SPEAKER_03: Obvious. All I was doing was gauging how sure you actually were. I think if you were really sure, you'd have been like, anything you want, buddy. Anything you want. But that immediate, I don't know. I know exactly how it's going to go. Listen to me. Listen to me, Corey. You are a big man. You are a big man. Say you were tasked with the job of stopping a runaway train.
SPEAKER_03: Would you try and jump in front of that train or would you climb on board and turn the engine off? I mean, there's an obvious answer there. Okay. I'm not trying to show how fucking tough I am. I'm just coming to beat you. I'm not trying to show that I can fucking jump in front of the train. Okay. I'm just going to turn the engine off very slowly.
SPEAKER_00: okay stop slowly yeah guys let me read this and we slowly finish aviator says 25 stronger canada like he put an elbows up and then canada flag he put and then steve the core is 200 corey is a 200 pound puller in a 400 pound meat switch i think it's terrible
SPEAKER_00: guys don't be mean to corey okay enlarge pronator as a canadian i am signing with letters but i am just hoping for a good match best of luck to both athletes and we yeah guys please don't send any more super chat this was good this was good yeah yeah i don't i am i'm not sure how corey will be taking all this from devon
SPEAKER_00: i don't know we will see we will see if you will see aggressive corey there or he will be one of those guys that will become quiet and question himself i hope not corey i hope i want you to roar you know like a lion you know ah there's this new thing that's out corey probably help you out a lot between now and then it's called ozempic okay you should you should start on it okay
SPEAKER_01: take it all the way through you'll look better people will respect you more i'm definitely yeah i'm down for the looking better part
SPEAKER_00: Clean yourself up. Yeah. That's why Devon makes everything more, I don't know, bring attention. Love him, hate him, but he brings the attention for sure with this making personal thing. I don't think Devon you are intentionally trying to do that because I think you enjoy this, doing this kind of things.
SPEAKER_00: We are going to have a fight, Engin. No, no, no. I understand. But some people just quiet and go and do the work. But you don't enjoy winning. That is not enough for you. You really like to do this kind of thing, and that really takes attention. We are not robots, Engin. The most powerful thing we have is not our arm. It's not. OK, yeah. So you are thinking that people who are not talking, they are not thinking?
SPEAKER_03: I think that maybe they haven't given themselves permission. I give you permission. Come fight me, Chub. I'm gonna ride you like a pig. I am, Cory. I'm gonna ride you like a pig in the summertime. I'm gonna twist your ear. You're gonna squeal in front of the Texas crowd.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, now the half of the people watching us saying, do Devon, do Devon. And the half of the people saying, Corey, make him eat his words. Corey, make him eat his words. That's why this guy is the most famous. Anyways, guys, do you guys have any last words to each other or to the fans or anything? Ozempic. Don't think about it. Don't think about it. Let it be a surprise.
