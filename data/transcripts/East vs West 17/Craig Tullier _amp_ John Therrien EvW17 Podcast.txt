SPEAKER_00: Hello, John. Hey, again. How's it going? Great, great. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. Is it possible for you to turn your phone sideways? Yeah. So we are live now. A little bit early before. Okay. And I think you need to unlock your...
SPEAKER_00: rotate option so that it will show you okay two seconds i just have to figure this out yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I just had a podcast with John Brzezink, another John. Yeah, I watched a little bit of it. You did? Yeah, that's good. That's good. Is my camera okay now, Inge? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it looks, yeah. Yeah, Pauline is going to also join. Oh, awesome. I like Pauline. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: so it will be so we can square the screen yes yeah that makes sense yes um let me start thumbnail yeah anyway so let me share this on social media the link okay and then we can start so
SPEAKER_00: John, what is happening to you? What's happening with you? You mean just in general or arm wrestling? No, no, no. I mean, you obviously were strong already. But I think lately you are... How old are you? I'm 29. 29, okay. Yeah, because now people are thinking that you are becoming...
SPEAKER_00: elite level you know worldwide yeah so do you think that your uh super matches international super matches and everything is helping your experience and things like that oh yeah for sure so that's exactly um before i'd say about two years ago i was only a hook puller and then i realized that uh pulling it this way people are very strong in the hook so i i started started top rolling
SPEAKER_02: and I have a very strong hand that's been helping me a lot and like you said traveling all over the world basically I learn new things from everyone I'm the type of guy that will listen to everyone every little trick so I am taking it as much as I can and processing that to the table as best as I can and how is your phone right now I heard it's great but
SPEAKER_02: Say that again, Egan? Your form. People say that you are in great shape right now. Oh yeah, I feel amazing. I've been competing a little bit too at the start of the year just to keep me in shape. I've been training very hard, eating healthy, so no injuries. I feel very good. So I'm super anxious for this match and I feel great. So how do you see your chances?
SPEAKER_02: I think I have very good chances. I know everyone says that Craig has a very, very strong hit, but I've been training exactly for that. I think if I can stop this hit, I think we're going to see a very good match. Yeah. So you are expecting a war? I am expecting a war for sure. I know Craig has a lot of side pressure, which is right in my office too.
SPEAKER_02: I have a lot of side pressures, so like I said, hopefully, I'm pretty sure I'll be able to stop his hit. Once the hit stops, then I think it's going to be a crazy war of who has the most side pressure and the most endurance. Hello, Paul. How are you? Hey, what's up, guys? Good. How are you doing? Great to see you. Great to see you. Long time. Me too. You too. We didn't have a podcast or phone call. Yes, sir. Yeah. So how is everything going?
SPEAKER_01: it's good very good can't complain yeah and how are the trainings good good uh it's it's been nice having you know a couple months to just train balance um i think your sound yeah what did you say because your sound went off and what did you say last couple months
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay, who is the internet guys? Is it my internet or your internet? How do you see John? Do you see me? Yeah, I see you're fine again. I think it's Paul's phone right now. Okay, okay. Yeah. Is it possible, John, you can little bit raise your face, you know, the camera? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, sir. That's better, yeah. Yeah, thank you. So you are expecting, okay, Robbie Russell says, hardest part with Craig is the sub is always at the pad for me. Not a person with more ref than I have then for that man. Having pulled you both, success, Jonas, heaven.
SPEAKER_02: um yeah we will see you will see so you are expecting when you are expecting craig to be offensive with the goal well yes 100 he's very aggressive with his head so i'm i'm definitely not going to try to be faster than him so i'm just going to concentrate on position gain my position and then uh
SPEAKER_00: when you when you stop him do you think where do you think you will end up you will end up by stopping his wrist or you will end up stopping his arm but in hook you guys will end up where do you think that you where do you feel that you will end up with him so my hand i'm not gonna lie my hand feels very amazing right now so i'm just thinking he's gonna hit side pressure so i'm thinking
SPEAKER_02: It's between he's going to go straight wrist or he's going to maybe end up losing his wrist. But I'm just going to try to contain him as high as possible because I know if he gets me down here, then I'm in trouble. Of course, his second hit is even better than his first hit. So my goal is just to try to catch him up high and then from there I can adjust and do what I do.
SPEAKER_01: And Paul, can you be objective about this match or as an American, you can't? Yeah, I can. I can. Yeah. I mean, I've never pulled John, so that's the disclaimer. But John has pulled people that I know. So I don't know firsthand what he feels like, but I've seen tons of his matches. And first and foremost, I see John a lot like Hunter Knopf's.
SPEAKER_01: He's been kind of going around and for quite some time, quietly sniping a lot of the top guys. And as of late, it's become more and more obvious.
SPEAKER_01: where his level's at which makes this match so much more interesting a year ago i would have been like craig 10 to 1 favorite now i'm like i don't know um especially you know his john's last outing against uh against brandon uh is what really really promoted this match for me i know how strong brandon's hand is and the way in which john pulled him and controlled his hand uh and kind of absorbed it
SPEAKER_01: it makes me think that this is a much closer match than I would have thought a year ago. That said, like, I do still give Craig a favorite, and that's based off of, you know, experience and his track record of just being there. And I know...
SPEAKER_01: I know Craig well enough, and you really have to have an exact, finite game plan for this guy because there's very few people on the planet who can meet him in a hook and stop his initiation. He's so good at getting to his spot first that it makes it so tricky. So I do think if the match stops, it's going to be a burner. But it's going to come down to that setup and that stop.
SPEAKER_00: So you are basically saying that there is a possibility, Craig, to be explosive enough to win this match. But if it stops, then you are expecting a war. Yes. And if I had to really say, how do I see the match playing out? I think no matter what, round one is going to be tough.
SPEAKER_01: Like there's going to be a feeling out process as far as what can you get in the setup? And, you know, if Craig hits a go, that first one's probably going to be quick. Then it's going to come down to adjustments, load and hand positioning in the setup. And then we'll see. And then if and when there is a stop, then that's when the match gets weird.
SPEAKER_00: you know the position that the messed up right it may be this position it may be this position it may be here it may be at the center so i i think that i think that where the mass stops also will show us you know some signs you know like like how is this gonna go 100 if we see this match stop
SPEAKER_01: in any semblance of a hook and john wins my head will explode that would be like the most impressive thing ever so john if you can do that make my head explode but i do think the the best the best option is you know if we if we see a stop it you know it i'm i'm thinking it's going to be flat-wristed or in a negative position no you don't you don't see inside like boom and then stop in the inside
SPEAKER_01: If I see that, my head's going to explode, and I'm going to go crazy, and it's going to be awesome. So you are saying that if Craig has his cupping, then it is very hard to stop him. This is what you're saying. Exactly. If there's any wrist flexion at all, he's going to be really tough. I don't think, you know, like in the States, I can't remember anybody, you know, regardless of weight class, when Craig gets a cupped wrist, stopping Craig.
SPEAKER_00: So Samush is the only person we saw do it. And Samush is a total weirdo. And also, Samush also said that Craig was very strong. Yes. To this day, he has still said that that's possibly the strongest inside puller he's faced since, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so I understand. I understand your point. And so do you also trust your inside game, John? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Like people think that I'm a top roller, but they keep forgetting that I was only a puller before. So my hook feels very strong too. Obviously it's not my goal to, to start a match, but if I have to, if someone brings me to the hook, I feel very comfortable in that position too. Like I said, wherever he, he brings me, I'll be ready for him. And like you guys were saying, it all depends where to catch him. If I catch him low.
SPEAKER_02: then yes, I agree, I'll be in trouble. Because hanging off my bicep with Craig's crazy hits, it's definitely going to be hard to contain and keep the endurance for the future rounds. But if I can stop him up high, then it changes the match completely. If I stop him up high, I think he can be in trouble at that point. So it all depends where I can manage to stop him.
SPEAKER_00: What's going on, buddy? Yeah. Craig, Craig, when are you going to get old? Never, never. Yeah, I mean, I feel the same way. We both will be 70 and I will still be setting matches for you. That's right, that's right. Yeah. Your first wife was 1992 Switzerland? When was it? Yeah, 1992 Geneva, Switzerland.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Wow. I wasn't even born back then. You said he wasn't born. You were born in what, 96? Yeah, 96. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Wow, long time. And Craig is still competitive up there at the global level. Great, great job, Craig. Thank you. It's amazing. It's amazing for sure. This guy, now he's more down on the ground, to the ground, you know. But before he said that you are number one. I need to steer the post, guys. You understand? I'm an organizer. He was saying that you are number one because you haven't met him.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that's what I've been seeing the posting and seeing him say that I think he's going off of, you know, some of the guys that he's arm wrestled against. He's not going to know. He's not going to know really where he stands until we pull. I really don't think he's going to like it. Truthfully, I respect his confidence, but.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, there's a reason why I'm where I am and, and, uh, you know, Pauline knows a lot of the guys know, cause they, they know me and I, I just, I know John's gonna, he's gonna have a different opinion after our match. So I can say something like that too. And then a reason he's number one still it's because Randall Seltzer moved up a weight class.
SPEAKER_02: And then Greg went back to first. So there's a few ways to look at it. Yes, I am confident too. If I wasn't confident, I wouldn't have asked for you. I don't think it's going to be an easy match for either of us. I feel like it's going to be a grinder and it's going to be a very fun match. We will see. Greg, Paul also is thinking that
SPEAKER_00: says that if you have a little bit cup you know with the goal he thinks that uh you you will win that match but he says that there may be a war if neither of you guys have a cup like do you see the same way or do you do you think that you there is a possibility you to beat
SPEAKER_04: uh john even with the outside move if necessary yeah yeah i've been working my top role a lot um i have a really good top role a lot of people don't realize that i mean you are you are an originally a top roller you know we know exactly exactly yeah um
SPEAKER_04: so I just I've developed a really strong side pressure and and so the hook a lot of times it goes into that but my top roll is very strong my hand I've worked my hand so much that that's why like in the straps a lot of times a lot of the people just fall away because my hand is so strong but yes I feel confidently that we could go to the outside too I do yeah and and and
SPEAKER_00: So, and, but John also is thinking, John seems like he disagrees with Paul. He says that he's like how you are originally a top roller from the past. And John says that he is originally a hoop puller. So he's ready there. Did I understand you right? John is what you said, right? Yeah. Yeah. I just mean that if Craig brings me to the hook, I'll also be comfortable there. It sounds like I don't have a hook. Hmm.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it will be good. It will be good. And we will see. We will see. Great. What are you, 1973, 74? 72. 72, yeah. 52. So you are like 52.
SPEAKER_00: 52 years old. Okay, 52 you are. And look at you, 52. And Devon is probably 49, almost 50 probably. Michael is 51. Jerry is around there. And Tata Sings, John, like, Dave Chaffee is very near to, I think, 50.
SPEAKER_00: So when we think about the North American arm wrestling, we are seeing all these guys like around 50 and over, and you guys are still dominant there. Do you think that like, why is it like that? Why, like, I know now you're going to pull John.
SPEAKER_00: we will see how it is, but, but so far, why all the, like not all, but majority of the best guys from North America are people from like around 50 years, you know, why, why is it like in the past when, when you guys were young, you guys still were the best, but, but you guys were like 20, 25, 30 years old. Like, so why is it like, why is it? Why? Because you guys were more international, like,
SPEAKER_00: like WAF and other events and after some time, best of the US pullers stopped competing in the international events except some heavyweights, super heavyweights. And do you think that that is the reason that younger guys are not as good as the older guys?
SPEAKER_04: know ing and i agree 100 you know i started at 16 years old and um at a very young age i uh started competing internationally you know just as yourself you know and i think what's made a lot of us excel in our careers is being exposed to the europeans and international uh level at a young age and as it went you know time period passes you know a lot of the americans
SPEAKER_04: They they haven't experienced that or haven't got to get to that level because of that. And I think that that's a big part of what's gotten, you know, a lot of us that's competing at the levels that we're at and, you know, staying healthy. You know, I'm going to be honest with you. You know, you know, there's a lot of a lot to be in smart with your training.
SPEAKER_04: knowing when to break and take a rest time. You know, I burned a candle at both ends. I know zero to 100 is wide open always for me. So it's really, you know, it's hard to to find that fine line, you know, because you have to have that. But, you know, I really I say for my career and I feel the same for John and Todd and Michael Todd and Devin.
SPEAKER_00: You know, the competing on that higher level for the time period that we have is what's gotten us to where we're at. And it separates us from the others. It is the competition level that makes someone better. Yeah, just Paul, like if somebody would ask me five years ago, like Pauline,
SPEAKER_00: will win East versus West level of world title and giving a hell of a match to Ruslan Babaev, like the way that you beat him once and the second time you guys had a war in Orlando. I would say no way. It will never, ever, ever happen. But you came to Istanbul, you competed, you came back, and don't you think that you got so much better compared to five years ago?
SPEAKER_01: A hundred percent. Like, you know, no matter how battle tested you are in pressure situations and other stances in life, going, you know, 12 hours, a 12 hour flight to another country you've never been to, to cut 15 pounds and then compete against, you know, a guy who doesn't speak the same language as you and who's a stone cold killer. It takes a set of balls and it's hard the first couple of times, no matter how you look at it.
SPEAKER_01: And every time you do it, it gets a little bit easier. And you know your playing field a little bit better. You understand the reffing better. You understand the go. You understand how people move and the differences between U.S. and Canada and the rest of the world. And there is definitely differences. I'm not ready to say that it's so crazy that it's insurmountable, but it's an adjustment period for sure. And the experience is worth its weight in gold.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And you guys, go ahead, John. Sorry. I totally agree with that. Obviously, I can't compare the level of experience that Craig has. He's been all over the place. But you asked me that question earlier, how I feel that traveling all over in the last year has made me better at wrestling. That's totally true. I've had the chance to practice with guys from Greece. I went to England. I've traveled all over the U.S. And that's what I keep telling everyone. I'm like,
SPEAKER_02: grip as many hands as possible because everyone pulls different and you just learn so much more pulling as much as you can. And table time, that's why I keep telling people as well, table time is the key to success basically because you build your confidence, strategy, like Paul said, the goal, the reffing, you just get to understand more and
SPEAKER_00: for sure that's one of the exam the reason why um the best unrest in north america are are all on the older side just because they understand the game like no one else can okay now this is getting too friendly so let me do something about it uh john okay this is yeah imagine this is march 29th 2025 and event just finished just finished the whole event finished
SPEAKER_00: How will John be feeling? I'll feel freaking great, Engin. I have been training. No, no, no. After the event finish, you will be feeling so great? Oh, fuck yeah. Sorry about language. Yes, I will be. Do you agree with him, Craig? Will he be feeling so great? I mean, he's going to feel great about not winning against me.
SPEAKER_00: okay yeah i mean i feel very confidently that that uh he's gonna he's gonna be um learning a lot at that event oh that's why he will feel good yes that's why he'll feel good oh okay he will he will understand that there is another level that he needs that's right okay that's right john listen you are the younger one we're gonna pick on you you know
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, no, that's fine. That's totally fine. And in between me and you guys, I think since the day I started arm wrestling, I've always been the underdog. Literally every match I've been to, I'm the underdog. And I quite honestly like it. A lot of times people don't take me too seriously like they should be. And it ends up biting them in the ass. So we'll see what happens. But I hope Craig, well, I know Craig trains every freaking day, but I hope he
SPEAKER_04: mentally prepares that it's not going to be an easy match like everyone thinks it will be. Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm excited, John. I'm very excited. I've got a whole shop full of arm wrestlers right now. We practice right at one o'clock on Sundays and they're out there chomping at the bit when we finish up to jump on me. Okay. So you didn't start yet or you just took a break?
SPEAKER_00: No, no, I stopped. I'm stopping right now to where when we finish, I'm going out there. Oh, come on. You did some, huh? You did some. A little bit. Oh, okay. Just show us some guns. Uh-huh. Yep. Not big enough. Not big enough. Okay. Great. He says not big enough. Yeah. He's got a lot to learn is all I got to say, Engin. Now, Paul...
SPEAKER_01: everybody he's gonna be objective now you're looking you're looking at pauline not from u.s but the pauline the armless because i'll tell you though to piggyback off of what we were talking about in the experience and stuff it's it's you talk about the older guys the battle tested guys being around like the battle tested guys are not turning matches down because they've already been there it's a known quantity for them
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how many matches are getting offered out there to new guys, but I can imagine how intimidating it is for some of these guys. Everybody might have East versus West as a goal, but when you get that call and it becomes real, you know, again, it takes a set of balls to accept that match, you know, because it's going to be on Main Street. Everybody's going to see it, YouTube and hundreds of thousands of views and people are going to be talking about Reddit and everything else.
SPEAKER_01: so just just accepting a match like this is is kudos itself and there is no losing in it regardless of it you win and and you know if you win you come away you feel great afterwards and you gained experience and if you lose you come away and you actually gain more experience in my opinion so
SPEAKER_01: It's like a double-edged, it almost evens out. I challenge any of these newer guys who get the opportunity, never decline a match, never decline an opportunity because you're cheating yourself out of that what if. And you're cheating yourself out of that learning experience because every loss is bringing you closer to your next win. So it takes intestinal fortitude to go into matches as an underdog, but it's also the best possible position to be in.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you're right. You're right. Yeah, just imagine that you're on the stage, walking, and then the other side of the table, Petrenko is waiting for you, Irakli is waiting for you, Ali Can is waiting for you, Samuse is waiting for you. That is, you said, you know, you need some strong arms, but also, as you said,
SPEAKER_04: Also, some balls, as you said. Yeah. Yeah. Guys, there's nothing like being on that stage that East versus West stage is hands down. I've been on a many stages across this world and on all levels. And I'm telling you, the East versus West stage, when you step on there,
SPEAKER_00: there's a feeling that comes upon you that I just I can't explain it to anybody. You know, the ones that experienced it, I know, but or see it. But it just it overcomes you, you know, and it's amazing. It's amazing. There is there is no tougher stage in this universe. That is that is the farthest you can you can reach. And Neil Pickup calls it Jurassic Park. Seriously, it is. It is just when you look at those monsters.
SPEAKER_00: it's not that easy to be there it's not easy to win and it is even so hard to win the title yeah yeah yeah and and after this match you have been at the east versus twice right craig
SPEAKER_00: Samusha and then Tom Holland. Yes. The Spider-Man. Yes. Yeah. And so this match, the winner for sure, you guys are not, the winner of this match is not getting another North American for sure. Winner of this match. Now we're going to find out the king of the North America and
SPEAKER_00: Whenever I look at like this, Craig is looking at me like, you're talking about me, just say it. John says something about it. Tell him that he's wrong. I'd rather just let him think about happiness and all that. 27 more days, right? 27 more days. Right. Yeah. I'll tell him then. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Dennis, thank you for your support, Dennis Tuller. And Dino is saying, hello, Paul, you're looking big. Yeah. I don't know about that. Paul is getting ready. I don't know which one. I have two guys in my mind about you. I have the board on the wall. I'm already making the Kazakhstan. Your opponent is either from...
SPEAKER_00: Georgia or Russia. So that's all I will say. Okay. And that narrows it down. I got three names now, so I know, I know who I'm training for at least vaguely. So Ingen, when is that match? Which one? For Paul. Oh, the Kazakhstan, May. All right. Yeah. And then we hopefully will have a second part, like second half of the June.
SPEAKER_00: another event in US. And then we would like to bring some Eastern guys to there for you guys, the winner of this match. You know, you guys know. What do you say, John?
SPEAKER_00: I'll be ready. Okay. Yeah, that's what I wanted to hear. But Craig is so quiet about it. He didn't say anything about it. Why is that, Craig? I said, I'm going to bring it for you guys. And John said that he's ready. So he's getting a ticket to come watch me pull then. Oh. That was a good one. That was a good one. It will be a great match. And let's talk about some other matches. Hunter Knowles will be pulling one and low.
SPEAKER_00: Valen is from Singapore. He's a very strong guy. But we know that Hunter is also very, very strong. Do you guys have any opinion about this match? What kilo are they pulling? It's 77 kilo, 170, I think 170 pounds. Yes. So I'm not too familiar with Valen, but I've watched a few videos on him. And all I can say, he looks like he has a very decent top role.
SPEAKER_02: But I think he's too slow. Hunter, I think, is just too explosive. I think it's just going to end up to the pad very quickly. That's my opinion, anyways, from what I know from the guys. Yeah. And Craig?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I agree. I mean, like, um, Hunter, he, um, a lot of people hasn't, haven't seen him compete, uh, on the high level like that, but they don't realize actually how strong Hunter is. Hunters, Hunters are very dominant force. I really, my, my pick is Hunter. And Paul?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I got 102. My only X factor there is where is he walking around weight-wise and how much weight does he have to cut? I think that's the variable that could play into it. I know he's got a background, I think, in MMA and wrestling and stuff, so I'm sure he can handle the weight cut. But I think the guy right now is on a really, really good trajectory, and it's going to take a really elite top roller to top roll him.
SPEAKER_01: and it's going to take an elite hooker to beat him in a hook too so i think i think he's he's on he's on a path to shake things up a little bit so i think i think i got him as a favorite do you guys think that he is ready for someone like mindy august or not yet yeah honestly go ahead go ahead paul i i don't think yet i wouldn't i mean like i i like the trajectory
SPEAKER_01: I like a couple steps to get him to Mandaugas. Test the waters, like maybe a good hooker and then a better top roller. But when you feed him right to Mandaugas, you're talking about like one of the best top rollers pound for pound on the planet. That could be maybe too early of a step.
SPEAKER_04: yeah i agree i don't count them out either yeah that's that's exactly what i was fixing to say too um i mean he's he's he's moving at the right level yes it's a little too soon for him yes yes he needs more international experience and what do you think john i think you have met him at some of the neil's events what do you think about his level i definitely um madagascar is just an artist at uh low hand top role he gets you like
SPEAKER_02: to the worst position ever, basically. It just burns you out. I definitely see this as a very good match in the future, but like the guy said, I think a few steps before he gets there, just to not feed him to the wolves right away. Yeah, yeah. That's why I'm going step by step with him. It would be... Go ahead, Paul. I think a good move is to give him a match outside of the United States or Canada, too.
SPEAKER_01: like get his feet wet there, you know, because that that's a part of it, too. How do you how do you handle all that? The travel and the pressure and not being on your home field advantage? Like, I think the guy's on a trajectory for the top and he needs that experience, too. Mm hmm. It definitely makes a difference. It definitely makes a big difference. Like I've been to Iron Wars a few times. I've been overseas to compete a few times. It's definitely
SPEAKER_02: in part of the sport to be able to get to the time change and just get your sleep corrected. And there's a lot involved into traveling. Yeah. Some guys, it's some guys that absolutely kills them, you know, and you can see it happen, especially
SPEAKER_01: Like early on guys getting their first shot and coming over and trying to cut weight and you just watch them kind of break under the pressure. Other people who have done it before, they seem to have no problem with it. Some people, I actually enjoy it. I'd like if I had to compare like my performance and mentality.
SPEAKER_01: When I'm traveling compared to home after having recent experiences, I think I'm better overseas, but I might just be a weirdo. You guys got to figure it out, I guess. I like to pull outside as well. The reason is that sometimes to pull at home makes you too emotional.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, too much pressure, you understand? Too much. Like, sometimes you want to just have, like, that chess player coldness, you understand? Instead of, like, feeling hyping, you understand? It kind of sometimes blinds you, especially if you are a chess player. If you are just a... Maybe it's good for you. I mean, you are... I'm not saying you are not a chess player, but you are... You just like to go pure power, Paul. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. Yeah. You guys remember a while ago, I said that, you know, to be at the East versus West stage, imagine that, you know, these guys are waiting at the other side of the table. And one of the names that I mentioned was Ali Can. And one guy says, I pray Ali Can is never waiting for me. And the other guy says, same man, I don't want Ali Can waiting for me. He can wait for someone else.
SPEAKER_00: That guy, especially the left forearm, I mean, he looks like those, I mean, cartoon, like superhero character, you know, like he's incredible. What do you think? Do you think he has any chance against Vitaly Laletin? I do. You think? Yeah. I do. That would be incredible, a 230-pound guy to win the Super Heavyweight. He already has 105, 115.
SPEAKER_00: If you also, and trust me, he is walking around normally 102 kilos. He can even make 95 kilos. And imagine that he's like somehow winning four categories. Wow. That really would make him best pound for pound left arm guys, you know. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, in the history I'm talking about. Yeah. So let's go. Yeah. We have an incredible match. Yanis Amorins versus Mindago Sarasaitis.
SPEAKER_02: That's definitely one of my favorite match. Both guys are very, very technical. They know pretty much everything that is into arm wrestling. But again, Nindagas is just something very special. He's so good at getting to his position before anyone else. And based on Yannis, oops, sorry. No problem. Based on Yannis last East versus West showing,
SPEAKER_04: I just have to give the edge to Mendoza, but we're going to see a match of insurance for sure. It's going to be a long, grander match. And you guys have any opinion about it, Craig versus Mendoza? So I think that as long as I've been watching Giannis' training that he's posting, and he seems like he's healthy since his injury with Justin. So honestly, if he's healthy...
SPEAKER_04: He's healthy. Right now, he's healthy and strong. He looks really good. I'm not going to say it's going to be an easy win, but it's going to be a good match. I really think Giannis is going to win it. That's my pick.
SPEAKER_01: i got i got i got mindy i think mindy is getting better and i would reference that that injury too i worry about that i don't think he can beat mindy if he's having side pressure issues so if he healed back up i think it's going to be good i mean the common opponent there is justin bishop between the two obviously time has passed and a lot was going on there
SPEAKER_01: but i mean we saw similar matches out of both of the guys as far as the dominant right both matches were three three two three two both matches and both matches seem to be like justin kind of wearing out a little bit
SPEAKER_01: you know, losing a little bit of that hammer curl. So by looking at that, if you're looking at the arm wrestling match there, it should be a really close match. And you also look at the styles, both of them being hand control dominant, kind of like defensive top roll. That makes for a very interesting match. I don't think it's going to be quick. And I think both of them are technical enough that it's going to be it's going to be a chess match. So I think it's an awesome match. But I just Mindy is seems to be ever improving.
SPEAKER_00: The guy, I just think the guy, he's special. I have a question. I'm looking forward to that one. Paul, I have a question. I think, were you in both cars when Justin pulled Minde and then Yannis pulled Justin? You were in Istanbul when Justin pulled Minde, right? You were, right? Yeah. So the question is, in which event do you think Justin was in better shape?
SPEAKER_01: I guess maybe. In Orlando, I guess. No? I think, I don't know. Because I think the first match with Minde, he was just coming back, you know, after some time. It was his first match, right? After the pandemic, yeah? Yeah, it was. That was his first one. Yeah, you could be right. You could be right. I just thought his form was good. I thought he nailed the cut. I thought he looked really good in that. But he definitely didn't have the body of work that he has now leading in, you know, that he had leading into Giannis, for sure. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: so my my opinion is that i can i cannot say who is winning but i my opinion justin in orlando was in better shape than justin in istanbul yes oh yeah he had no travel to worry about there too yeah yeah yeah anyways so i pulled with justin uh before we did some training before each each one of those and when he pulled yannis for orlando he was in a much better shape stronger too yeah that's what i was guessing but now you guys yeah saying the same thing yet
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so Matt Mask versus Keder Gali Ongarbaev. Are you guys excited to have Keder Gali over there? Oh, I'm excited. How healthy is Ongarbaev? I mean, right now, I think he's healthy, but this is his first comeback in a match after he had an elbow surgery. Last summer, he had an elbow surgery, and now he's back, but this is first match.
SPEAKER_00: So, and I saw, Paul, you were there when Matt beat Barboza. Matt was in incredible shape. Very good. Very good. Yeah, Matt has been asking me, give me like top 10 ranked guy. Give me a top 10 ranked guy. And I was just saying, like, this is not, I was almost going to set him with Rustam Bavaya, but I thought that Ongar Bavaya would be a better option. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: It's definitely going to be a very fun match to watch. It's going to be definitely aggressive. I have to give the slight edge to Matt. I think with his leverage, he'll be able to get better hand control. But that's a very hard match to gauge just because we haven't seen Bebe have pulled in a while. On that web, yeah. Sorry, my bad. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I'm going to say that, Matt, I agree, Matt. I think the way that Matt's going right now and the way he's looking, I'm going to give a little bit of the edge to Matt. You know, now, you can't take nothing from Angabaev. Angabaev is so strong. He's so explosive. I mean, if Matt messes up at all, I mean, he could capitalize on it. So I think it's going to be a small, small edge to Matt. And Paul?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, Matt has, we've seen so many versions of him. I've seen him in Istanbul when he wasn't at his best. I've seen him when he's really firing on all cylinders. I'm hoping he brings his best. I think if he brings his best, I think his odds are solid. I think the good thing about the match is it's a big long arm versus a big long arm and a big strong hand versus a big strong hand. So you don't have the contrast that you would have with Rustem.
SPEAKER_01: So I think it's probably better for Matt to be pulling a top roller.
SPEAKER_01: Um, I hope he can get a little ground early on. So he really fires up and gets that momentum. That's what I really want to see the dynamic between the two. Once Matt starts slamming and shaking the table. Cause you know, anger bias. So cool. He's like, like nothing's going on, you know, but I think it could, it could wind up being a really good match thing. It comes down to those intangibles. Like where's Matt, what version of matter we getting and what version of anger buyer we get. And those are the unknowns. Hmm.
SPEAKER_00: So we can say that someone is a very clear favorite. The match can go either way. I got Andrabayev as a slight favorite, like if I'm just making odds, but I'm rooting heavy for Matt. I love seeing Matt win. Okay, so let's go to another one. Dave Chaffee versus Gilgis Letko.
SPEAKER_00: I talked with Dave Chaffee like two days ago. He was my guest. And he said that he has been healthy. And he said that he is able to do some of the trainings that he hasn't been able to do because of his injury. Now he says he's healthier and stronger. How do you guys see this match? Who wants to go first? Yeah, I'll go.
SPEAKER_02: I know it all depends on what shade Dave's come in. If he's ready for it, I'm afraid he's still going to be losing his hand. But I think he has enough arm power to finish a match. So that's a very hard one to call. I don't see who would be the favorite, but I'll go with Dave just because I like Dave.
SPEAKER_04: I think that, uh, Georgie's, uh, hosting pronating top role is extremely hard to deal with. Um, as long as if, if the, the, the, the shape of Dave comes in to when he pulled like Dennis and, and the guys that, uh, the, the big Zloty's and all that, I think that, you know, Dave is the upper hand, but, um, I I'm really concerned on, uh, that, that post and, and pronation that Georgie has, I'm,
SPEAKER_00: i'm concerned that you know dave might have some problems with that but then his side pressure and his arm strength is going to have to play a serious toll on that so i think it's going to be a war i really do i believe so as well i believe like dave has a better side pressure while probably georgia has better recent pronation but if if they get through like
SPEAKER_00: So until here, even if he loses his wrist, Dave now has this option as well. So I think we will see if Georgie can stop him and lift him back or if Dave is going to press Georgie with the deadlifts because Dave's shoulder pressure looks very deadly. And if he can activate it without his hand. So even if he loses his hand, I'm not going to get
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah it's it's it's it's where that happens that's going to decide though i think you're like like like uh craig saying that posted top roll that riser like georgie's incredibly hard to hook and he's not a guy that loses in a top roll by losing his wrist either so as of late like we've seen dave kind of like whole hand top roll in you know but if if you know if he doesn't protect that top knuckle
SPEAKER_01: and he gets crested over if there's any give in the 10 to 2 area where the hand goes that's where it becomes a problem for dave but if dave can get offense flat-wristed even if his wrist goes he's going to be able to tuck in and side pressure but it's going to be that you know that classic like back pressure posted back pressure versus how is that going to negate the center table side pressure i think it's a really interesting match and i really think it's going to be a war
SPEAKER_00: It's 50-50 to me. I don't see any domination from neither side. Me neither. I mean, I would give probably a slight endurance edge to Jordan. To who? Jordan? Yeah, I would. I think he's got a tank for a big guy. He does. Uh-huh. Baba, listen. Dave also has, like, Dave, just remember his match with Lalletti? Even the match that he lost...
SPEAKER_00: One round he was able to go to strip and he stopped and he still was able to press Vitaly. I mean, once he puts his shoulder behind, even if he loses the hand, I think he's incredible. Yeah, I love that match. And let me ask you this, Engin. Ask me as many questions as possible. I'm tired of asking questions. You ask me. So if Dave wins that match,
SPEAKER_00: Let's go into the future a little bit. If Dave wins that match, who are potential opponents for him? Because to me, that's a big win for Dave right now. You know what would be a great match? I think he versus Dzerhanov would be a great match. I love that match. Yeah. I mean, listen, listen. We have so many options. We haven't seen Dzerhanov in a long time. Yeah, Dzerhanov, I think he lost against Laletin. He had some injury. Probably we will see him in Kazakhstan May event. Most likely a left arm match. And then
SPEAKER_00: If we get visa for him, then American events and like everything about the US events, even we are planning in Canada as well, Toronto. But it is all up to the visa process. I think the one event in Toronto,
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I think that it would shake all country, you know, like I think there would be a lot of people, you know, especially if there is a good Devon match there. Yeah. I think Zoranoff and Chafee is a good match regardless of this outcome of this match. Yeah. I think that's just a really good stylistic match regardless of what happens here. I'd like to see that at some point, no matter what. Yes, yes, yes, yes. We will see all these matches.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, now. Engin, I got to drop quick. My wife just came and yelled at me at Sunday dinner time. Okay, okay. Two minutes. We start with you. John Bursey versus Yoshinobu Kanai. This was going to be the last one. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, I catch you good.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah i you know i was discussing this one before um and i also was listening to your podcast with hutchings and hutchings i thought he encapsulated it pretty well i think john has the hand to be able to deal with the king's move a little bit better than todd did i think todd made the match harder than it had to be and we talked about it afterwards too and he was telling me like i got flustered i was worried about fouls
SPEAKER_01: and like i i think that was a great match it was phenomenal but i think john has the ability to climb over that king's move and be patient uh but i don't think in any way shape or form that that is going to be an easy match i'm predicting that one to be like match of the night i i don't i don't think john can beat yoshinobu with uh orthodoxy armor i think he needs to finish with
SPEAKER_00: this way you don't think he can you don't think he can climb he won't climb but still the finishing needs to be shoulder pressure in my opinion yes yes yeah he has that he's gonna have to be inside no no he has that that's why i'm thinking that that's a delay he needs to take the center to the halfway here and when yoshi is like this i saw when todd was trying to finish yoshi it was not going anywhere at some point i thought
SPEAKER_00: Like, Todd wanted to do the shoulder pressure because he felt like that is the lane. But Todd probably realized that, no, that's not what I am doing best. Yeah, but it was a great match. John transitions to that smoother than anybody. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. John even did that. I don't know how he did with Leonidas. He just ground here and then, yeah. If John finds that lane, he's going to use it. Maybe next one month he won't be able to train.
SPEAKER_00: because he will hurt probably. I wish I had half the lanes John has, man. Paul, we will let you go and we continue with Craig and John. Thank you, guys. Thank you very much. Great seeing you guys. Good luck to both of you. Take care, stay blessed. Take care, Paul. Take care, my friend. And you guys, what do you guys think about this match, Kanai versus John? Paul basically is
SPEAKER_02: said it correctly i i think john has this very strong hand so he'll be able to climb and then he'll find a lane to be able to beat him but there's no way that's going to be an easy match and i totally agree i could see this match being the match of the night
SPEAKER_04: And you know, like the bad thing is, is what a lot of people don't realize is when, when you get positioning on somebody like him and you start to go sideways, that's when you start, the pressure forces your hand and wrist backwards. And a lot of people aren't accustomed to that pressure or feeling that or knowing what to do. You know, John, John's pulled a lot of people that's Kings moved and, and, and, you know, his hand is so strong. His pronation is very strong.
SPEAKER_00: I think his transition is what's going to save him to be able to beat Yoshi, I think. I really do. It's going to be okay. Do you agree that he needs to take him to at least help? Absolutely. He's going to have to get him over. He's got to get on top of the hand, get his hand turned some. Craig, while we're talking about John, and since you have watched John in his prime as well for many years, and
SPEAKER_00: right now he's around 60 years old and some some new fans are questioning his greatness by looking at his performance at 60 and they are like oh he can't be the god you know and things like that what would you like what would you like to say about this no i mean i just listen i never talked with you about this subject but but we we both are from the same generation
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about this guy so that you can share with this new generation that don't understand how great he was? That's the one thing I will say before you start. Were we not guys like watching John when his name is called going up there? Were we not like people who are like almost like same as like seeing
SPEAKER_04: alien from another planet you know right he was right right right yeah yeah it's fun it's funny because like a lot of them don't realize like both of us have seen john just line up
SPEAKER_04: You know, every super heavyweight, any, any country's best. I mean, he's, I've been there and watched him just dominate. He's beating any pressure, any position, any technique. He has just dominated any of them in that, you know, um, John is just, he's out of this world. Yes, he was. You know, if there is one person, people says, if you think that, have you ever seen someone who may not be, he may not be human. I will, I will say John.
SPEAKER_00: In his prime, he really felt that way to us. You guys are around 200 pounds right now. This guy, majority of his career, he was around 200 pounds and was beating those super heavyweights. And in my opinion, he has been the best overall in the world in more years than anyone in the history. Maybe now Levan is catching up.
SPEAKER_00: But other than that, he has been there. Can you imagine a 200-pound guy? Just say 210 pounds most of his career. Of course, later, when he gets older, he gets heavier because of probably mostly unnecessary weight. But in his best years, he was around 200, 210 pounds guy. Imagine beating all those giants. For Levin to be considered maybe one day to go, he definitely needs to pull a lot more than he is.
SPEAKER_02: John has pulled so many guys. John would not deny any matches. He was dominant for years after years. And like you said, being at 200 pounds, beating super heavyweights. That's the most impressive part. 200 pounds and winning the super heavyweights. It was interesting. Okay, now we have another Canadian. How do you pronounce her name? Jocelyn? Jocelyn. Jocelyn.
SPEAKER_00: jocelyn jocelyn okay versus sarah last year she beat sarah and sarah is waiting for revenge
SPEAKER_00: And how do you see this, John? Because I'm sure you are, are you near to each other in Canada? Yeah, I train. Jocelyn is part of my team. We train together. Oh, you train together. She's your teammate. Oh, okay. So, okay. I'm sure you can't be objective, but tell us what you think. Obviously, I'm going to start with Sarah Backman. Sarah Backman is an amazing athlete. If she accepted the match, that means...
SPEAKER_02: She definitely thinks she made some change and she's able to win the match. But at the same time, I train with Jocelyn. Jocelyn is just improving and improving. So since their last match, Jocelyn got even stronger. Can you tell us a little bit about her? How long has she been playing? I'm not exactly sure, but I would say about five years. She's definitely not...
SPEAKER_02: as experienced as Sarah Backman is. But she is very, very motivated. She trains every day. She's ready to jump up to the main stage for sure. And I don't see this being a victory for Sarah Backman, unfortunately. Jocelyn is just on the warpath right now and she's ready to go crush it on the main stage. So you are saying that Jocelyn is favored?
SPEAKER_00: Personally, I really think Jocelyn's going to take the win again. If she beats Sarah, do you think that we should think that now she's... Do you know how it is? That's really interesting. We have up there, Barbora and Gabriela. Barbora is the best. Gabriela is second, but very close second. And then we have some gap. And then we have Egle. And now we have even bigger gap.
SPEAKER_02: Then we have Sarah there before Jocelyn. So do you think that if Jocelyn beats Sarah, you think that her next should be someone like Egle? I totally agree with that. I think that would be a fair step. Same thing we said with Hunter. Just steps to the right directions instead of waiting for the top two girls right away. But I don't know. Sorry, my phone just fell.
SPEAKER_02: i just don't know how strong gabby is i've never had support with her but i could see this in the future gabby and jocelyn being a very very good match um but yeah i would definitely take this a few steps to get there for sure okay and craig
SPEAKER_04: So I've had the pleasure of pulling Gabby and Sarah. I've never pulled England and Barbara. But I gripped up with Jocelyn and had the pleasure to see her. When was this? This was at the 220 round robin. After she won the women's round robin.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, okay. So that was in the same event that she beat Sarah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, Jocelyn is extremely strong human being. I mean, she is strong. Um, I know that, you know, through the years I've known Sarah ever since I've seen her get on the stages from young ages to now and Sarah is phenomenal. She's a phenomenal arm wrestler, a phenomenal athlete. Um, I,
SPEAKER_04: I'm a little concerned because Sarah's been cutting down, cutting weight and getting down. I know that she's going to have to be the strongest form of Sarah to be able to pull Jocelyn. I agree with John. I know Jocelyn's been training. She's improving. She's hungry. She's very hungry. I see that. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I think it's going to be a seriously serious match between her and Sarah. I think Sarah's going to have to compromise Jocelyn's hand. I really do. I think she's going to have to compromise her hand and get her outside of her shoulder and arm a little bit to win this. I really do. But you are saying even if Sarah wins, do you think that it will be a top match? I think so. I really do. And now we have another match. Let's start with you, Craig.
SPEAKER_00: You have trained with Cody Merritt, right? And he is now pulling a left-arm match against Evgeny Prudnik. Evgeny Prudnik lately didn't do so well at the East vs. West. And he wants to change this. And I think he lost against Ali Can, then he lost against Irakli, and then he lost against Tatachins.
SPEAKER_00: and now he wants to do better. So how do you see this match?
SPEAKER_04: So I've trained with Cody Merritt a lot, and I'm going to tell you, I honestly think that he's the favorite in that match. Now, I'm not saying that Prudnik is not strong, because we all know Prudnik is strong. I just – I know that Cody's hand and Cody's back pressure and his side pressure hit I think is going to –
SPEAKER_02: take prudnik out of his power i really do think i i think that that cody's gonna win it i really do my pick is cody and you john i i totally agree with that and cody's just so so the hand dominant the back pressure i think he's going to take prudnik just way out of his lane and they just he's just such a big human being so much power behind his arm all right so i have to go
SPEAKER_00: Cody for sure. And now we have another Canada versus US match. Devon versus Corey. Left arm match. How do you guys see this one? You want me to go? Go ahead, John. Corey, I know how strong Corey is. It's just amazing how strong that guy is left hand. But Devon right now is...
SPEAKER_00: just not looking human. He is the biggest he's ever been, and it's scary looking. So I don't really know where to go with that match. It's not Devin's best arm. Do you think that Devin will be as big as he was in Tbilisi? I think he's going to be even bigger. You think he will be bigger? In my opinion, he will not be bigger.
SPEAKER_00: You don't think so? No, I don't think so. I think that it is not even super healthy to remain that that that weight, you know, like, I would never want to be that big, you know, for a long time. And especially if you are near 50 years old, I think that you need to be really little bit
SPEAKER_00: Um, healthy, you know, no, no disrespect to anyone, but I think you need to be a little bit healthy. Yeah. Yeah. Like if you say that that way six months, I don't think it's a very good idea. Yeah. I think just to pick there is good, but to remain, to be at the same weight there, just my opinion, you know? Yeah. So weight and the size of Devin will definitely, uh, change the match outcome.
SPEAKER_02: But I just think Devin's so strong right now. I have to give the slight edge to Devin. But he's definitely going to lose the first round at least. I think Devin's going to lose that one. And then the endurance is going to come in afterwards. I think Devin's going to win. But it's not going to be an easy match.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I expect a war. I expect a war. If somehow it goes to the endurance battle, I see Devon favorites. But explosiveness with the first go, if Devon is really stronger, and then I think he can have the control right away. But if somehow, because of Korea's very explosive sideways start, if Devon's arm stretches to halfway here,
SPEAKER_00: And I have seen Corey applying shoulder pressure and he's no disrespect with a big guy, you understand? And there is a possibility him to shoulder press Devon. So if the match goes this way, it is very risky. This is what I see. But if it is very, like if it stops somewhere, that shoulder pressure is not possible.
SPEAKER_00: then I think Devin will tire Corey and win the match, which is just my opinion. I'm not saying who's going to win or something. I just say possibilities. But how do you see, Craig? I think the start of it, like you're saying, from here to here, is going to be a big deciding factor for Devin.
SPEAKER_04: because I know how strong Corey is so strong. He's a very big human being. He's strong. His hand is strong and his side pressure is strong. And I just think that Devin is going to have to be very offensive and is going to have to be trying to take control of the match right off the start to make sure that he maximizes putting Corey in some form of a defense move that's going to take him out of his lane.
SPEAKER_00: And then he will be exhausted and that's right. That's why you are saying that you agree that there was shouldn't be in.
SPEAKER_00: Like losing position so much. That's right. I think that if it goes over in that way, then Corey is going to come down on top of him with that shoulder and it's going to be... Yeah, yeah, that shoulder. I'm not sure if Corey can finish him by going outside more and more. But if it stretches him and then he puts the shoulder... I have seen, I mentioned this a few times already, because we talked about the same matches.
SPEAKER_00: Now one training I saw him with Paolo and then Paolo just took his wrist and he put shoulder and he was able to very easily press. So I just say that he has that ability. That's the scary thing. You don't want your arm to be here and him to put all his body weight. That is something that, you know. That's dangerous. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think that that is with left arm especially is the...
SPEAKER_00: weak spot of devil like if he goes here i think with right arm he is more inside game side game you know with left arm he is more like pronation but we don't know his shape he has been training so maybe he will stop him at the center but if he goes here it will be very very hard match yeah yeah he's definitely gonna screw around with the setup to try to burn out uh corey's uh hand from the get-go because
SPEAKER_00: that's what he's a master of trying to burn you out because he has the most endurance so we're definitely going to see a long setup in the first round no no they they can't be long setup there is a time limit and yeah but we're still going to be seeing a little bit of that screw around no yeah i know i know there will be some intention but yeah i mean yeah i understand yes
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so it will be a good match. I believe it will be a very good match. And we will see. And we have the last thing I want to... We have like one hour we are here. And do you guys think Hermes can do as good as last time or even better against Levan? I personally think he would do better just because he...
SPEAKER_00: How's the experience? He knows what to expect this time around. And yes, Levan is getting stronger and stronger, but I strongly believe he can do better. But we know that Hermes is also getting stronger. Hermes to be younger than Levan and to think that he is not getting stronger also, I don't think. Yeah, I think Hermes is also getting stronger, but we will see who will do better homework, you know.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Yeah. You know, coming into this match, he knows what he felt when he pulled a low on last time. Yeah. And you know, army's pulled him very well. I mean,
SPEAKER_04: he put him all the way to the revel in there, you know, and I honestly, I think that, you know, now he knows what to work and what to expect. I know he's probably every time he goes to sleep, he's thinking about that match and what he did. So that's what I would be doing. You know, so, you know, I think that it has the very big potential to put LaVon on the bad side of that. I really do. If he does that, then when I watched the first, first match, the round that he stopped him and put the shoulder behind, I was like,
SPEAKER_00: it's not real it's not happening like everything was like like either the time stop or or was like like slow motion everything was going you know yeah yeah yeah because nobody expected that you know nobody expected that and Hermes is a very good arm master like oh yeah like when i saw Michael in Tbilisi
SPEAKER_00: I don't think I have ever seen Michael that big, in that great shape, and he was mentally so focused. He was breathing fire, you know, and he was very strong. And Hermes, today I talked with John Bersink as well, Hermes had to pull in a perfect way to beat.
SPEAKER_00: michael and he pulled in a perfect way perfect possible way and he still was very close when he tried to uh finish the match so ms is very good armistice very very good armistice do you guys like who are the uh guys that impresses you the most from overseas you know from this side of the world those kazakhs georgians russians ukrainians like who who who are you guys more i don't know how to say like impressed you know by
SPEAKER_02: What's his name, the guy that just told Brad Grundy, Rhino? Oh, Bacho. Bacho. That really amazed me. I knew he had the edge on Brad Grundy, but to beat Brad Grundy this fairly easy, that just surprised the heck out of me.
SPEAKER_00: And his mindset, at the press conference, both Irakli and him were sitting at my left side. And they were like three chairs apart from each other. And whenever I asked him, he said he's coming for both 95 and 105 kilo world title.
SPEAKER_00: At that time, press conference, Irakli was the champion. So he didn't really care about it. He just said it, you understand? Like, I'm coming for 95 and under 5 kilo. So it just shows that not only here, but here is also ready. And you, Craig, are you impressed? Any guys like...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I'm going to say that Georgian team is just so strong and so dedicated, you know, from all of them. I mean, David Samusha is an amazing athlete, you know. You know, I even like Azura, you know.
SPEAKER_04: Garnati, Levon, I mean, all of them, man, they're just, they're phenomenal. You know, it's just, you know, the other ones that stand out for me is, you know, of course, Hermes. Hermes is so technical and so strong. I've watched him from a light weight, you know, back when he was younger to all the way now as a junior, running the worlds in a junior, you know, just phenomenal. And then, you know,
SPEAKER_00: you can't take nothing from the Kazakhstan guys. I mean, they're just so, those three eras of people right there are just phenomenal. What did you think about the, you remember Samusha's match with Aydar Khan from Kazakhstan? Yes. 4-3, 4-3. Were you impressed with that match? Very impressed, very impressed. Me too, me too. If Aydar Khan had the shoulder pressure, I think he could have won, but he didn't have that one, yeah. Yep, I agree.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it was incredible. How is he doing? How is he doing right now? I mean, he's doing great. He's doing great. I mean, if he doesn't have any other plan, you know,
SPEAKER_00: hopefully in May we will see him again. It's beautiful, Craig, like such a beautiful sport and all those superstars, you know, on this stage all the time pulling against each other. I love it. This has been our dream, Craig. Yeah. It has. It has been, yeah. And now we are, we are,

Do you know how it is? You want to make a cake, but I only bring the ingredients, you know, together. You have to mix it. Yeah, but everything needed is already
SPEAKER_00: Like they existed, you understand? They were there. They were just waiting someone to bring them together and show this beautiful sport to the world through my eyes. Because whenever I look at it, I know how much I enjoy. And so whenever you show the sport through my eyes,
SPEAKER_00: And then people saw that the beauty, which already existed, it was already beautiful. I didn't do anything. I just showed them how beautiful it is, how beautiful you guys are.
