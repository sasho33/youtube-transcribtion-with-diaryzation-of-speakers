SPEAKER_00: Korea now in WAF. Will we see Korean guys in... Yeah, I mean, that is not only being part of the WAF, but that's also being, like, at that level, you know. Most likely, East vs. West. We don't know if it's East vs. West, King of the Table. Most likely, King of the Table will be in... Most likely in Istanbul on May 10th. Hello, February.
SPEAKER_00: Hello to Sasha and Kirill, yeah. Vanity, hello. Yeah, I'm very excited for John Mashkeet, very excited. That guy is just, guys, please understand that that guy is a gold and
SPEAKER_00: Of course, of course, Garrett, yeah, Yoshi will get more matches. You saw how Yoshi just came out of nowhere and suddenly gave the toughest match to Todd Hutchings. He's another legend. Yeah, King of the Table and East versus West, yeah, same rules, yeah. 4AM training and listening to podcasts. Yeah, good luck, my friends, good luck. Like, just never stop training.
SPEAKER_00: Hello, Onlylifts. Hello, my friend. Hello, Benji. Are you there yet? Hello, Armwrestling Wizard. Much peace and health. Thank you. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Gray Mechanic. I can't wait to go to the event, seeing John in person. Yeah, just don't miss it. Don't miss it. You won't, like... I don't know, like, what John is planning, but...
SPEAKER_00: This Saturday or a year later or something, you are just seeing probably the last times, I cannot say last time, we don't know that, but last times of John Burzink. He's 60 years old, and I have witnessed his prime, and to me, he will always be the gold.
SPEAKER_00: I don't have any opponent for mine. If I pull, probably I would pull Mindaugas, but I don't know what I am doing. I just get, like, I would say encouraged, you know, and then I see that I'm not trained still, you know, and...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, don't miss it, guys. Don't miss it, guys. Right now, you are seeing there Pele of football, Muhammad Ali of boxing, you know, Alexander Karelin of wrestling, you know. Hello, hello to Canada, Rick. Hello, Canada. Johnny's 62? I don't think Johnny's 62. Maybe this year, I think he will be 61, but...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. I mean, no, I'm not sad or something. I only wish the best for John. If he continues, I support him. If he quits at some point, I support him. Whatever feels good for him, I support him. We can't be selfish.
SPEAKER_00: The venue is the best venue, my friend. The venue is the best venue. When you go there, you will see the sign of reaching through mainstream sport level. Yeah. Yeah, Yoshien. No, no, no, not here. Not for the podcast, no.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, the fouls are two fouls, yeah. Yeah. Best top five for every match except the world title matches. This event, we don't have the world title match, but we have some great events. Like, I'm very curious about Devon versus Corey. I don't think it will be an easy match. I won't be surprised if it will be a very, very tough one. Who is Yoshi?
SPEAKER_00: Yoshi is a legend from Japan. Yeah, yeah. Just please don't miss it. Incredible event. I don't know, my friend. I need to first convince myself before convincing Neil Keats. I don't think John can hook him. I don't think so. I don't think John can hook him. But there is a possibility John to...
SPEAKER_00: top roll him and then finish with the deadrested what do you mean who will host king of the table it is it is you know this is Robert Baxter is there together Dexter 10 is helping him yeah yeah the new new stream which yeah they are they are great yeah the next level
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Under 20 years old. I'm not sure about that. Oh, there will be Neil Pickup and Stefan. Stefan from Switzerland.
SPEAKER_00: Um, I don't think we have ever seen super heavyweight Brudnick. You know, I think he's like maximum 250 pounds, 115 kilo. Yes, yes, I'm sure it's warm there now, Benji. It is not said to you enough, but you are a legend yourself. Diamonds, dirty hands. Thank you, my friend. Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: I will be holding, you know, my breath, you know, I will probably
SPEAKER_00: I think the Texas Armwrestling League is helping us to organize the tournament day before. John Burzing versus Kanai is the main event. I'm not sure about what's Dennis doing. I need to talk. No, I don't understand Ukrainian.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think Hermes have better chances with versus Levan with East versus West rules? I'm not sure, my friends. I don't think that anyone should depend so much on the rules, you know. We all should depend on just bringing that hand to the pin pad, you know. I don't know what is Dennis doing. Ah, Chappie versus Georgi, another match that I'm very, very curious about it.
SPEAKER_00: I would say that Georgi would be favorite if Dave Chaffee wasn't healthy, but Dave says that he's not the same guy that we have seen. We had seen like in last a few years, he said he's healthy now.
SPEAKER_00: Craig versus John, I don't know, my friend. Craig is a legend. He's a very dangerous guy. But people also talk about John very highly and so I'm not sure about that either. That is the beauty. Why Yoshi John podcast is that where John lives and where Yoshi lives is about 15 or 16 hours time zone difference. And
SPEAKER_00: So also Yoshi said that he couldn't find translator and I couldn't find any Japanese translator either, but. Levan versus Hermes will be in June, Haziranda.
SPEAKER_00: Armwrestling intelligence, are you going to bring more celebrity matches to the future events or is that not a priority? My friend, yeah, we want to do that. Yeah, we want to do that. Yeah. And armwrestling needs that. Yeah, we should do that. Yeah. It's not the priority, priority, but like whenever we can organize a good one, we need to do it. Good afternoon, Woody.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, me too. I'm looking forward to Saturday. It will be incredible, incredible. Just... In my opinion, it is the best North American card so far. Maybe not the best East-West card, but the best North American card. And we promise you that we will do better and better and better, yeah. Yeah, I saw that later, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: If I have a strong square pronator, but a weak round pronator, will I win? I don't know what kind of question that was. Hello, Constant Gains. Thank you for your support, my friend. Yeah, Levan versus Hermes is June. GB19, Texas crowd and weather is the best. Atlas will have a black... Yeah, I have no doubt. I think it will be great.
SPEAKER_00: Who is next for Tozilla? He's going to pull Rustam Babaev. Rustam Babaev, he's going to pull in May for the world title, for the middleweight world title. You need to win the qualification event to be qualified for the finals and then win there. Devon versus Mozart. Who is that? Ongarbeev. Ongarbeev is pulling Matt Mask, as you know, this Saturday.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, incredible matches, incredible matches. There is no match in that cart in Arlington that I'm not curious about. Like, I'm curious about all of them. Yeah. Yeah, Tata Sinks versus Rushtam will be great. Rushtam has beaten him.
SPEAKER_00: uh, in two previous times that they met. He beat him 6-0 in a super match, and, like, he also beat him in the Zloty Tour 2005. But looks like Toddzilla is getting better and better, you know? Uh, Vegas event or some other places, like, we will be organizing all over. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Uncle Todd will really help Brian show. Uncle Todd knows what he's doing. People think that he doesn't know because sometimes he doesn't look so, I don't know how to say, aesthetic. He doesn't look so smooth, but he exactly knows what he's doing. In his training, he knows what he's doing. At the table, he knows what he's doing.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about the Devon's present strength? No, he cannot beat Devon right now. But the shape that he was in, Tbilisi is different. I don't think he's in the same shape as Tbilisi.
SPEAKER_00: I think he's underestimating this event. Or maybe, maybe, maybe he's right. I don't know. We will see, but I don't think it will be an easy match. I think that Corey versus Devon will be a tough match, especially the fresh rounds or rounds. Yes, Gennady is cutting down to 115 kilo, yeah. When, where? Oh, we plan Hermes versus Levon to be in North America.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, there will be a fight sooner or later, Ali Canmuradov and David Dadikian, yeah. How to not get in the hook? It is not that easy, my friend. It's not like giving you how to make, you know, rice food recipe, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Hello to Canada, Bacio versus Tozzile. Yeah, I mean, Tozzile, I will tell you guys something. You know, this guy is, do you know what kind of guy? If I call him and I tell him, hey, Todd, I'm setting you against Hermes Gasparini, or if I say I'm setting you against Artem Morozov, he wouldn't say no. I mean, he would maybe doubt if it's a good match or something, but he wouldn't say no.
SPEAKER_00: So Todd is type of guy that whenever I tell him, like, who do you want to pull? He says, you're the boss, you know, you tell me I pull, you know, that type of guy. I can say that Todd Hutchings is the easiest guy to work with. Easiest guy, you know, I mean, it's not because he says, okay, but it is just like the guy is just brave enough to pull against anyone.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, his first place in Boston would be great, yeah. Yeah, Northeast is my favorite, you know. No disrespect, but... Ah, no, Artem Morozov is not done with the left arm. He just needs to heal up. Arsen Liliyev, I don't think Arsen is training. Arsen is more focused on right now. I just wrote him a message about...
SPEAKER_00: 10 days ago, yeah, he puts the business work, you know, as his priority. Yeah, Di Sereno will be in the next event. I think Levan is the strongest ever, my friend. I don't have anything.
SPEAKER_00: Dixon Nass, thank you for your super chat. 59 and still picking. Todd is the god of all sports. I'm not sure he's the god of all sports, but if you ask me, he's for sure a legend. Oleg Cherkasov is banned by Rusada. Rusada. And I think his ban is ending next year.
SPEAKER_00: Can you tell Devon? I said, hey, my friend, I am not in Arlington. John versus Yoshi is very close match. Both has chance to win. I don't think Richard is coming back to the sport. Richard is probably very near 70 years old, probably.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know when Dennis will compete, he will let me know. Yeah, Todd Ziele is also, yeah. I heard Brian Shaw is coming to Arlington, but not Levan. No, Arsene is not motivated to come back. We need Makay versus Kalinyshenko revenge match. Oh, that's the match that he broke his arm, right?
SPEAKER_00: I'm not rooting for Devin or Corey. I'm not rooting for... As long as I'm organizing events, I'm not rooting for anyone. Taras Ivakin, as far as I know, he was in Ukrainian army. I don't think he looks...
SPEAKER_00: Egle. Egle, we need to find Egle an opponent, my friends. Yeah, Egle is, like, somewhere. Like, Barbara beat him, beat her, sorry, and Gabriela beat her, and then Egle beat Sara easy. So, like, Egle is somewhere that is not possible to reach Barbara and looks like about...
SPEAKER_00: way about it looked that way at this last time sarah so maybe another gabriella match maybe yeah and gabriella i remember beat her right and left yeah um at some point yeah it needs to happen yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Beijing versus Toyota would be very interesting, yeah. Yeah, Jerry is pulling in June. I will announce those matches. My friend, it is the Russian anti-doping agency banned. Like, it has nothing to do with us or anything. Russia banned him.
SPEAKER_00: don't find it fair because he used a vertigo medicine. You know what vertigo? Those crystals, you know, behind your ear, as far as I know, that, you know, makes you have your balance. They sometimes move and then you can't even walk straight, you know. You feel like it's earthquake is happening, you know. And this guy used vertigo medicine. Vertigo medicine, I don't know how it helps someone to be successful in arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_00: And because of the vertigo medicine, they banned him for three years. Yes, he pulled in some other organizations, but we follow the international rules of the WADA and the RUSADA and, you know. Yeah, at some point we will see Devon versus Hermes, yeah, again.
SPEAKER_00: What are you saying, Bestavo? Is that a question or I don't know? Yeah, Cherkasov is a legend. Cherkasov is incredible. Yeah, can you believe that the vertigo medicine is considered as prohibited medicine? Please visit the website for the merch.
SPEAKER_00: Ali Can versus Devon, left arm, at some point, yeah, we can do it, yeah. Devon versus Vitaly, time will show. Right now, Vitaly has Michael Todd to pull, and it is a tough match, you know. No, I'm not competing. I'm not competing. Maybe someday, maybe never. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe, yeah, maybe increase his focus, but I don't think that Cerkasov used that to increase his focus or something. Probably he didn't even know that such medicine would be banned, you know? Just a guy. How are you? Thank you, my friend. Thank you, I'm fine. And you? Um...
SPEAKER_00: um i'm not in good shape i'm not good in good shape yeah i am probably 50 55 i mean my weights may be more than that but the table table today today after the iftar you know it's month of ramadan we are fasting from sunrise to sunset we are not eating we are not drinking anything you know and then after that
SPEAKER_00: After iftar, my student, world champion student, Yusuf Yildizoglu, he's two times WAP champion and two times silver medalist. He will come and we will train, but he's, right now, too strong for me. He's too strong, yeah. I mean, like, he's probably 20% stronger than I am. Yeah, everything is okay.
SPEAKER_00: What do I think about Russian actors? I don't know who they are, sorry. I don't really follow even the Hollywood stuff so much. Even though they are very popular, you know, but I don't really enjoy so much. No, nobody is joining the podcast. I just wanted to chat with you guys. I just wanted to chat, talk with you guys.
SPEAKER_00: I used to have armwrestling club and training, mostly like from 12 years to 15, 16 years, 17 years old kids, but I don't do that. I don't have time for that anymore. Will I beat Levan? Of course you will beat Levan. Of course. Curious as to why you don't use other referees such as Luke and Bill. I mean, Luke and Bill...
SPEAKER_00: What do I do in my free time? I don't have free time. That's why I can't train. But hopefully after now, when Robert get involved now, I will have more time with my son. Probably we'll play PlayStation, we'll play football. Hello to Texas.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, why not use Hristo for every Devon match, so we avoid making it 30 minutes long? Okay, when is Devon Vitaly right arm will come? Possibly, yes, but we don't know yet. Who is the best arm master? What do you mean? Best ever is John Burzink, no doubt. And the strongest, if you are asking, every category has strongest pullers, and Levan,
SPEAKER_00: Left arm, so far, Vitaly Laletin. And pound for pound, left arm, I think, Ali Can. And right arm, either Devon or Samusha. Hello, hello to Kashmir Abdul Hadi. Yeah, guys, please don't be spamming.
SPEAKER_00: Who would you say is the second best armwrestler right now? We have rankings. Number one is Levan, if you are asking right arm. Number two is Devin. Both Ivan Matushenko and Ibrahim Sago, they will have a match in the next event, but they are not pulling against each other.
SPEAKER_00: Levan is injured. I think mostly because of his shoulder. And once he fixes his shoulder, I think he will come back. And I think he's slowly training. Will we get 800 pounds Devon Arati? I heard he will be 900 pounds. Yeah, and yeah, he's coming. Merhaba, kardeşim. Yeah, Denis Sipenko, I think he's gonna, if he's healthy, I think he's gonna be back, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Guys, try to not ask so long questions because chat is moving and I can't even read them. Will Devon next match will be left? Yeah, this Saturday he's pulling against Corey West. Left arm, yes. Devon said he plans to reach 330 pounds. Yeah, possible. 330 pounds is 150 kilos for his height.
SPEAKER_00: he wouldn't, I mean, it depends, you know, what kind of weight he's going to put, but he is, the way that he put the weight when he was in Tbilisi, I mean, you can't really call him a fat guy, but it's something, you know, like muscle, real muscle, and then a little bit water, or maybe some fat as well, but it wasn't really so clean weight, but still you can see that he put
SPEAKER_00: really good size on him, yeah. I mean, I saw some photos of Hermes, and Hermes really looks big, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Really, he looks really big, you know. I think a few days ago, I think he sent a photo. And right here, he really looks big, at least to me. He looks very strong right now. And what is your favorite match this Saturday?
SPEAKER_00: What is your favorite? My favorite, a few of them, a few of them, but I can't wait for like all of them, but Yanis versus Mindaugas, John versus Kanai, Devon versus Corey, Matt, I mean, all of them, I don't know, like, I don't know. Yeah, Yoshi versus, yeah, Ongarbe, good suggestion, good suggestion.
SPEAKER_00: Do you want to see someone win against Levan? I mean, no. I mean, I can't say that I want someone to beat Levan or Levan to beat someone. I don't really care, you know. At our position, I think that... I mean, I wouldn't want anyone to be so afraid to pull against Levan. I would want everyone to be brave and do their best against Levan. But winning, losing, it's not my business, you know. I mean...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, just whenever you guys, some of you guys are threatening, you know, just understand it's not going to work. Just try to be polite, so I also stay polite, yeah. Yes, yeah, you can win, you know, when you are skilled, especially against someone like, yeah, athletes that arrive in Texas, yeah, some of them already. I saw Devon, I saw Kanai, I saw Ongarbev, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: flex my muscle i can flex my pronator if you want but i don't know if you can see or not but it's right here it's not really well trained but how good is brian i don't know i i don't think i don't think he's at the
SPEAKER_00: in his category, but for sure he looks determined, you know, he's still training. Okay, guys, how long we are here? 32 minutes.
SPEAKER_00: mean if leonidas would like to pull yeah we are open to give him a match here why desperation move is banned because when when your shoulder is under table level your hand cannot come there you either need to break that arm or you need to press so much that you need to make the guy jump up all his weight you know
SPEAKER_00: don't believe in any kind of bullshit that is defending this one okay if the shoulder is about the table then it is it is allowed because i mean that is okay but whenever it's like this like you make someone arm like 180 degree just and you you are still not winner you are still like you just made him like straight and you're not winning if this then i understand that part but
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, guys, anyways, so I just support the event. It is the best event that ever happened in North America. I mean, no doubt about this. And it will be a great one. I just can't wait.
SPEAKER_00: We will see. I asked a question, but I don't know if you guys answered or not. Maybe I was answering a question. What is your favorite match on Saturday? Let me remind you, John versus Kanai, Devon versus Corey, Mindaugas versus Yanis. We have Sara versus Jocelyn. We have Ongarve versus Matt Mask. We have Hunter versus Mindaugas left arm and Hunter versus Valen with right arm.
SPEAKER_00: We have Cody versus Joseph. We have... We have... I need a list. Yeah, Dave Chaffee versus... Svetkov, Georgi Svetkov. Al Prudnik versus Cody Merritt. Yeah, it's incredible also, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, this is great event, you know. Anywhere is possible. We can do event in Bulgaria. We can do in anywhere. Yeah, we are like most, like almost like 100% it is that November event will be in Switzerland.
SPEAKER_00: We don't know if it's the last match of John. We don't know that. It is something that John is gonna decide. But like, counter for the deep hook, you know. My friend, it is not only like about, like trust me, when you say hook,
SPEAKER_00: there are like so many different type of hooks. Like you say hook, and I can show you 20 different things, you know? And it depends who is doing it, how fast the guy is, how tall his arm, you know? It is just like, trust me, it is not that simple. Like I can give you an advice, you may do it and it may not work. Also, it is not about what you do. It is about how strong you do. And...
SPEAKER_00: How coordinated you do. Like, trust me, it is just like, I mean, it is way too simple way to ask such question, you know. What type of move I like in arm wrestling? I like the way to apply pressure from
SPEAKER_00: all of my muscle groups at same time against all of the muscle counter muscle groups of my opponent who can technique is better wisdom or you want um two different one two different one yeah if you ask me i would i wouldn't choose ivan
SPEAKER_00: very quick hands very quick like rushtam is very strong and but while like e1 is you know very quick strong very explosive no hermes is not 183 hermes is more than 183 trust me
SPEAKER_00: Okay, guys, I am finishing. What do you mean wrist is more important than forearm? I mean, when you say forearm is here also, everywhere here, the wrist is also like, what do you mean wrist and forearm? Okay, guys, thank you very much for joining. Just support the event. I just can't wait. It is a beautiful event Saturday waiting for us.
SPEAKER_00: and okay when people are disrespectful you know what we are doing anyways you all take care of yourself and thank you very very much and for joining me
