SPEAKER_03: I'm fine. You, my friend? Good, good, good, good. How is the feeling after? Super, my friend. Really, I feel too much good now. Because after one year,
SPEAKER_02: When did they compete? You competed on December 9th, I think, in the King of the Table 9 against Vitaly Lazarev. With the right arm, yes. Yes, and after I had the injury,
SPEAKER_03: I was prepared for Dennis. After this, I was paying my shoulder. And when you don't compete... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. You feel like you... Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's good. I'm happy. Do you have any shoulder issues, anything? You don't have? Yeah. Wrist. It's normal. It's very normal. It's very normal. If you are arm wrestling with Michael Todd, you will have some wrist problem.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he's pronated. Everything is strong. People underestimate Michael, but they don't probably realize how good Michael is, right? I was just checking if it is my internet or your internet, but
SPEAKER_02: I think it's just your internet. It's good now. You are freezing, I think. Are you moving? If you are not moving. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's good now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Good now. Yeah, good. But whenever you ask me good and you are not moving, I don't know if you're freezing or you are not moving. Yeah, now I'm doing good. Yeah. Anyway, so what was I going to say?
SPEAKER_02: I don't understand how people think that Michael is an easy opponent. From my side, to pull in against Michael is a nightmare. I was a lot stressed about this fight.
SPEAKER_02: When I showed Michael in November with Gennady, he said, I hope Gennady won the match. You didn't want to deal with that. Listen, it doesn't matter how strong you are. You need to play a chess game. I saw what you did. You didn't go, you come back, waited here.
SPEAKER_02: waited and then climb and then rise, rise, rise, rise. Yeah, and it's very hard to finish the match. This is a big problem. Yes, yes. And you know, with Gennady, more or less, if I take a rift, I can finish more easier. I mean, I think mentally to pull Gennady is easier because, I mean, mentally, like he has huge heart, you know, he's a warrior, everything.
SPEAKER_03: it is more difficult to pull against Michael. What he is doing, not many people can handle with that. No, no, no. This is for sure. Yes, I hope when I was in November, I hope Gennady won.
SPEAKER_03: After this, I prepared everything for Michael. But I taught him to take all the risks. Here, his pronation. Because he never lost his pronation too much. He lost maybe a little bit, but he held it every time.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe it was better to climb more, maybe. Yeah, but I saw that his riser was also strong. When you were rising, you guys were very close. I tried. Yeah. You had a bit more advantage because of your shoulder position while he was like this. Yeah, if you see.
SPEAKER_02: Usually, when I'm ready to do some competition, I'm a little bit down with my body. Yeah. This method was more higher to control. You had to a little bit follow him and not to leave him so much. Yeah, like this, you know. Yeah, yeah. Because the more you pull, the more you put pressure on your hand. You need to come and more like rise up, you know, yeah. Exactly, exactly. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, yeah, I saw that. Yeah. So I don't understand it. It's what I tried to say that a lot of people, you know, they underestimate Michael, but trust me, none of them would want to pull against Michael. I say in the video, I think only three people. Devon, I think he can win, maybe. Levan. But every time, you don't know if it will happen or not.
SPEAKER_03: They have the cards to win this match. But to have the card to happen in reality is a very big difference. Other athletes, I don't know because someone like Lallatin is super strong but he doesn't have too much strong press. Gennady Loft. I think Michael is a very dangerous opponent for Lallatin.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, for everyone. If that match stops, it's a big, big risk. And Dino says that the new king of armwrestling after June, he says that you are going to win. He showed the future, my friend. He showed the future? Yeah. We will see how it will be. It will be very hard, but really...
SPEAKER_03: First time I felt not scary, but maybe I can stop a little bit. I'm happy you remember. But this time you're going there to win, right? Yeah. This time my plan is I already see everything, what I need to do.
SPEAKER_03: I need to train this part and to check with my coach and everything. But if I can stop the match, I think I will win for sure. This time for sure. Can I ask you something? Round three, you had that trouble you gave him.
SPEAKER_02: And then the second start in the round three, you wanted to go directly here and then you made a mistake. Big mistake. Yeah, yeah. But before that, before that, Levan, I'm talking about earlier rounds, before round three, Levan took you here and waited, waited, and you were only pulling, pulling, and then he beat you.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that if you would try this and then this earlier rounds, you think you could still trouble him? I don't know. Because you didn't try this, right, in the early rounds? No, no, no. Maybe, yes, because I was too much open with my arm. But it was stronger in the first round.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that you will be stronger than your last time shape? Yes. Are you already? My hand reached pronation rising completely different. So only the arm is probably same, but here, here, here is better. Here I will give him a more difficult time.
SPEAKER_03: compared last time for sure he will he will feel something different on my hand for sure arm or same will be stronger for sure and if i can take something on his wrist i don't know i can top roll him but i can okay you are saying that basically even you cannot take his wrist but if he cannot bend you like this
SPEAKER_02: Last time it was like this. Maybe I can hold it like this. Last, everything will change. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I agree. Yeah, it will be. There are two Super Chats. One I can't read. I think it's Arabic language. We want Vitaly versus Jerry Cadoret. Right arm, please.
SPEAKER_02: I think that would be a very interesting match as well. And Dino says, when you win, you will make me pizza for this prediction. You're going to make a pizza for this guy. Yes. For everybody. Everybody. Okay. One more question I want to ask you. Like, do you think that, do you think that
SPEAKER_02: You are like 50-50 with Levan or you're an underdog? Or you are favourite? Favourite. You're favourite? Listen, listen, when I ask you a question, you answer and at the same time you laugh. I don't know if it's serious or not. I'm joking, my friend. Nobody is a favourite with him. Okay. But, but...
SPEAKER_02: But if last time they gave me to like all the people, all the others, they gave me, oh, impossible, we'll be 6-0. But you know what I don't understand, Ermes? Only 10%. Listen, listen, listen. People are interesting, you know, very interesting people. You know, I don't know if some of them have fish memory or not, but when you pull against Levan...
SPEAKER_02: And they were all bringing you to the sky, you know, they were saying Hermes, Hermes, Hermes, Hermes. And now they're acting like, you know, you are nobody. Like, why is it? Why is it? Like, why is it changing? I'm not talking about everyone, but there are so many contradictions. Like one is why Levan pulled two times a year and then when you bring the
SPEAKER_03: Best guys against him? Oh, this is a mismatch. You understand? No, maybe with me, I'm so different now because I think and I don't want to upgrade myself, but it's the reality.
SPEAKER_03: I'm the only one and he gave it to him a very hard time, you know, the, in the competition and maybe for these, a lot of people think I can do a good competition. Yeah. Yeah. Like the guy is incredible. He is incredible. And.
SPEAKER_02: He knows you now, and you know him now, but there is no doubt, Ermes Gasparini gave the toughest match to Levan Saginashvili in his professional career. Yeah, in my opinion. Levan wants to, there is nothing wrong with this, but Levan wants to prove that that happened only one time. And you want to prove that it wasn't only one time, and my guess,
SPEAKER_02: Like question, do you plan to give him like hard time or do you plan to beat him? No, no, I want to beat him. You want to beat him. My friend. You told me one thing. My dream is. To wake up. The morning, wake up. You want to wake up. Open my eyes. I'm number one in the world. I understand. I want to be number one.
SPEAKER_03: at least one time in my life you know after this we will see but one time in my life i want to to feel i'm number one the world this this is my dream and this is why i training like crazy and i sacrificed myself and this is my job and i want to finish
SPEAKER_03: After this, we will see there are a lot of matches. But if you want to be number one, you need to beat Lewandowski. Now he is number one. Someone needs to beat him. There is a question. We have right now 517 people watching and except a few of them, they are all respectful and they enjoy the program.
SPEAKER_02: except a few provocators. Peter is asking, can you ask Hermes best back pressure exercise? Back pressure, you can train in the gym with dumbbells or barbells. For me, it's with the cable. I think that is the exercise that help you to stop
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, because if you want to stop him, you need to have at least the same or close arm power in his position. If he is stronger, 20 per cent more than you, you can have hand control and everything. If you see Devon, super hand control.
SPEAKER_02: If you don't have a power arm, he goes down very easily. This is the problem with him. Doretto is asking, is Hermes worried about Levan using a flop wrist press? He used it on Devin and pushed through his pronation in round one. Are you afraid that
SPEAKER_03: No, because I saw many times he did press with Gennady, many other opponents in the past, and he tried with me when we fought. If he will do this, I think I will be more advantageous because I think nobody can beat me in floor press. I need to be super tired
SPEAKER_03: maybe they can beat me, but in floor press, nobody can beat me. This is for sure. Because this part is, if I'm close, here is my most stronger part. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And you need to be confident.
SPEAKER_03: You need to be motivated for this fight, not to go and we will see what will happen. He's super strong, never lost. You need to go like a gladiator. If you see that he tried to press Hermes and he couldn't, do you think Levan tried to press you during the match?
SPEAKER_03: I think one time I saw him. Yes, when he was like this and they said, come on, come on. He tried and his wrist back down and he went again in the top roll. Yeah, it was great. It was a great event. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And he will have pressure like crazy because he knows I'm a very tough opponent for him. Yeah, yeah. He will arrive for sure stronger than ever. For sure. He wants to delete all the videos about the mask and everything. He wants to delete. You are saying that he wants to...
SPEAKER_02: He wants to beat you so badly that people will forget about what happened before. Exactly. But it will not happen, my friend. It will not happen? Impossible. Impossible. I feel already super energy now, my friend. Think about June or whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It will be incredible, yeah. It will be incredible, yeah. And...
SPEAKER_02: So, what did you think more about the Michael match? About what, my friend? Like, how strong was he? Which part bothered you other than his pronator?
SPEAKER_03: Prunator is really amazing strong. He needs to grow up his riser because here immediately I felt completely dominant. Immediately I felt dominant. Endurance, he has super endurance because with this technique he can hold a lot. Can I ask you something?
SPEAKER_02: Whenever you went here, you were almost like I was like... Completely relaxed. Relaxed, but the reason you do that is because you are resting and you are making sure that you don't feel pressure because the more you put pressure, the more your hand is having...
SPEAKER_03: Exactly. If you are here, he can pull you and your arm will be tired. If you are here, he is already here, he can pull you too much. So you basically did the same thing.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, a lot of people say that he's a losing position, very bad position, but it was not. I can't stay here two hours, three hours. People were not afraid of that, that he could pay you that way, but Michael is known.
SPEAKER_03: to come in for a quick press? No, he tried two or three times, but to lose with this position, I need to be super tired. He did it two or three times, but it was not successful.
SPEAKER_03: I want to tell to the people I saw a lot of bad comments about him. He's not very respectful. I understand maybe the style is not good. Nobody likes to match.
SPEAKER_02: uh but uh like a person really is very good guy also my friends as long as his shoulder is above like this i mean it's an open arm top roll you know like why do you have like once you do that i i'm the biggest hater of this one like i really like this yeah but but if your michael has been arm resting like this and
SPEAKER_02: so what is the problem with this you know i i don't understand i know that there is some range of motion problem or something but i don't understand it the same people my friend i'm wrestling and athletes you know human heartless but even as an arm does he not deserve respect as an arm master as well no no no no yes he does right he needs to ever yes yes for sure yeah yeah i mean
SPEAKER_03: This guy has beaten Pushkar 6-0. This guy has won rounds against him. Yes, he's a legend. He's doing racing from 30 years ago. Maybe more, I don't know. And the mentality is crazy. He started already yesterday. He posted a video to start to do a lot.
SPEAKER_02: He asked me how to train the riser. For me, it's a super honor for someone like him. It means that he has no ego. Exactly. We all learn, we all learn. If you see, okay, one second, there is a super chat, a few of them. Engin and Hermes, greetings. What do each of you think, know,
SPEAKER_02: number of supermatch between I think no of the supermatch between Tazil and Bacho the old man versus new kid I think it would be a good match but I think that Bacho is not experienced enough to deal with Todd Bacho needs to be very very strong to beat Todd I'm not saying it's not possible or something but if Bacho would be more experienced then he would have like
SPEAKER_02: more chance because we can see his genetic is very good. But Tata thinks, I mean, he's crazy. Some people think that he doesn't know how to arm wrestle. They don't know what you are talking about. He doesn't have hand control or something, but trust me, his anatomic knowledge and the way that he's training, very smart, but he has incredible genetics. All that pressure he does, if I would do that, I would break my
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, me too, that's right. The guy handles it, you know. I think about genetically, to do this movement is one of the best. And he knows very well how to train himself. This is a very important part.
SPEAKER_03: how to train for himself and when what to do what to do for the because my friend maybe i'm doing a lot of mistakes but i don't know you you too or devon or levan he know a lot how to train himself you know he's an engineer he's an engineer guy with very good genetics he's smart
SPEAKER_02: And he comes up with strategy for every match. Like Devon does the same thing. If Devon has an opponent, you also have that. Not everyone has that knowledge of specific training understanding. Yeah, there is another super chat. Matteo Bernasconi. Yeah. He says, he says, Hermes, you are a terrible arm master. Just joking.
SPEAKER_02: I can see me too, my friend. Hi. I bought the latest pay-per-view and it was fantastic. Thanks, Engin, for everything you do for arm wrestling and arm wrestling for the results and the energy you give every day to so many guys. Vecchio. Okay. I don't know what he said. Vecchio.
SPEAKER_03: Beto is like France. It's like, hey, buddy. And Lobati, Levan, this time you will beat Levan.
SPEAKER_02: When Hermes stopped Levan, my adrenaline was crazy. I can only imagine Hermes how he felt. And what I heard, maybe I shouldn't say it, but Hermes told me that after 4-0, he said that Levan's corner was laughing at him, right?
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, no. After 2-0. After 2-0, okay. After 2-0 they were laughing and then you get angry, right? I remember very well his girlfriend and his friends and one guy with a mask of Hulk, you know, like a cartoon. Yeah. And when I saw this part for me, because I'm too much
SPEAKER_03: I have too much ego when there are these moments, you know. I have an honor, you know. Yes, yes, yes. I understand. When I show somebody love about me like this, I hope more haters I have, really. Yeah, really. I prefer to have more haters.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And there is another super shit. Yeah, you don't beat him like this. For me, it's super extra energy, really. Super important. I will tell you something. Like, whenever that was the round that you were like this, you know, and then that was one of the moments that, like, life, like, time stopped. Like, the same. When you did that, I was like, is this real? Is this really happening? And then whenever it stopped,
SPEAKER_02: Levan, round one. Exactly moments, same, like this. And then Alijan, Alijan, Matushenko, round one, they were stopped, they couldn't go. I was like, wow, wow, you know. There are some moments that life stops, you know, yeah. Yes, yes, unbelievable. Yeah, there is one guy, one guy with the Arabic name again, Engin, I think you should try to do event in Saudi Arabia, boxing, did some big events here. It's a good idea to make arm wrestling bigger. Yes, I agree with you.
SPEAKER_03: Tomoe says, I believe Hermes is destined to be number one in the world. He says it is your destiny. Thank you so much. Really, I show a lot of comments every time, many, many messages on Instagram. And really, I'm super honoured to have this love about him.
SPEAKER_02: this guy really super mega support really too much too much too much thank you so much guys yeah there is one guy is repeating the same thing can you guys put like 20 things you know telling the truth Hermes you should try desperation move against Levan you have the hand and back pressure to do it you know
SPEAKER_03: It's difficult to do this because someone has the elbow that can't do it. I tried joking with my friends, but I felt pain immediately. There is one question that people are asking about
SPEAKER_02: Okay, there's one guy who says, hi Engin, will you organize the East vs West in Italy? I mean, if the conditions are, I mean, good, then of course. Inside an arena of Rome. Yeah, yeah. Like, you know, with the mask, gladiator. Oh, you know, with Claudio, I would do it for sure. Like, Claudio is one of the guys that I respect and trust.
SPEAKER_02: in the community yeah yeah he's a very good guy really yeah and okay what happened with long time nosy my friend after had a match against petrenko in italy he had an elbow surgery and
SPEAKER_02: they move a piece of bone from his elbow. He's just coming back and next event, March 29th, he will have a super match in Arlington, Texas. Okay. Okay, people are asking me, Hermes, about like,
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if you remember or not, if you watch what Dennis was talking about, that he wants to do the match in May. You remember or not? I had a podcast. He said in May. Yeah. But I didn't tell him anything, but I knew that he cannot pull in May.
SPEAKER_02: Because I also had a hair transplantation. And when you have a hair transplant, doctor tells you not to get any sweaty. You don't train. You can't do anything for some time. Getting sweaty is the worst thing.
SPEAKER_02: I got the information that he can't pull in May because of this. But I think that after summer, from September to December, I think it will be possible for Denis to be back with us. Did you see the Corey West vs. Devin match? Yes, a direct fight, really.
SPEAKER_03: I think a lot of people think Devon is a favorite, but they don't think he's really strong with his right arm. And Corey West, he did very well last time with Tobias. I will tell you something, my friend. Every match that went to strep against Tobias,
SPEAKER_03: Corrie won dominantly. Once it was in step, Corrie won dominantly. When he has the control of the hand, you know, very tight, he can push more harder with the arm. I think they were favourites.
SPEAKER_02: because his pronation can open his wrist, but it will be not an easy match. Like 50, 60, 55, 60 to Devon. For sure, my opinion, the match is going to go strapped. That's my opinion. Did you know that Tobias has one of the strongest grips? After Valentin, probably he has the strongest grip.
SPEAKER_02: So it is hard to sleep from his hand. So those four rounds, Corey just couldn't. But once Corey went to strap, he was able to win. And I think it was, if I am not mistaken, it was a dominant fashion. So do you think that... I think the match will be close. It will be harder for each. Yeah. I would be very, very surprised if Devin dominates that match from the beginning.
SPEAKER_02: very very surprised i i mean i'm expecting a serious trouble for them with left arm a serious trouble i'm expecting because korea has very strong side pressure very strong side pressure and and he also has this like if he if he takes the center
SPEAKER_02: He can use the press. Oh, yeah. He can do the shoulder pressure, yes. So that is the thing. If the match comes here and if Corey puts his whole body weight, there is a possibility for him to press. For these things, I put 55. A little bit Dave on favorite, but not too much. Yeah, I understand. There are so many good matches to make. So many good matches to make, yeah. I show John.
SPEAKER_03: What do you expect from that match? I think John is John. He can use all the techniques. Kanai is like Michael Todd more or less. He will win, but it will be a very, very hard match.
SPEAKER_02: I understand. We will see how it will be. What did you think about the matches at the East vs West 16? What did you think about Golemanov? Did you expect Golemanov to win against Davutashvili? I expected it was 50-50, but Golemanov, his top row is unbelievable, really.
SPEAKER_03: with the side pressure really very solid nobody care about too much nobody know about too much about golemanov but i started to see him the first video when he fought with uh john brzenk senek you remember yeah yeah yeah one week later and john said
SPEAKER_03: John said the people think it was easy, but it was not too much easy when they pulled it. And this time I think John was in very good shape. I don't know when it was. When he played against Stojan? Yeah. No, he wasn't in super shape. Ah, no? No. The following year he was still...
SPEAKER_02: The shoulder injury, he had it. But it was not bad shape, but he beat Stoyan. And then one week later, he came here and pulled against Krasimir Kostadinov, and he lost that one. I remember. He beat Krasimir only one week after that one. Only one week, yeah. But Stoyan, Stoyan, Stoyan. I thought that in myself, I thought that Davutashvili would be favorite. And then when I did the face-off,
SPEAKER_02: And when I look at the arms, Sojan was the biggest. My friend, say to me how you are excited when there are face-offs. Every time I show your face. Yeah, yeah. But I'm telling you, my friend, those are all heroes. We need to show them. We need to really treat them as superstars. They're incredible. And what did you think about Sojan?
SPEAKER_03: but he's completely dominant. I didn't expect him to be dominant, really, because his wrist is super strong, really. He was super. Now we will see who can fight with him, to see the level, because nobody knows already. Slowly, slowly.
SPEAKER_02: He lost with Rino, but Rino is a good sample now. Yeah, but early rounds were very close and Baccio almost beat him and Rino was just barely, barely. And then Baccio got tired, but we saw how Rino beat Sago, so it shows that Baccio is a different level.
SPEAKER_03: After it was Lamparelli with Kalinicenko. It was exactly what I expected. I expected it to be more of a hard fight. No, I expected it to be technically a top roll and he goes like this, but I didn't expect him to win quicker. I thought it would be more of a fight. This is what I mean.
SPEAKER_03: I think to slip out when someone wants to hold you, you need to go only back pressure, no side pressure. What do you think? When Kalina takes his finger,
SPEAKER_03: But Kalina was prepared, really. It was stronger. Maybe Frank needed to train more side pressure to have more this control. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't think that
SPEAKER_02: Serhii would be that strong when he lost weight. I didn't think that he would still be that. He lost more than 10 kilos and still he was strong enough to press, you know, and it was interesting, yeah. And I see that Frank was bigger than usual, you know. Yeah, yeah, he was in good shape. Yeah, yeah. Maybe he needed more time to train more, right?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. And Fia versus Malin, Fia was dominant? This I don't show, but I show Fia was very dominant. Yeah, she was, yeah. But to me, both are great pullers, but Fia was stronger this time, yeah. Yeah. After this, to that team, with Herakli,
SPEAKER_02: I think there was other matches. Let's go back. Oleg Dzok versus Prokopchuk. Prokopchuk did everything he can, but he said that Engin, his hand is just so big, and he said he can't really hold it. I think he tried to do this. He was successful. He didn't lose wrist, but now he pinned him over his
SPEAKER_02: Like, over his... Oh, too much leverage, too much different size of the hand and everything. You know why it is? Because Oleg said that he wants to put in 85 kilos at that time. After he lost against Petkili, he said, Engin, I want a match in 85 kilos. And he already beat Toms at the Europeans and Worlds. And then he beat Tutberidze.
SPEAKER_02: at the East versus West. So I just, and we know that Prokopchik is too much for his category so far. Like two matches and he beat Emil and he beat Bojidar. No problem. So it was normal that I said this match, but we found out that, you know, this is very hard to beat. I think Oleg Zok is coming back. Not there yet, but I think he's coming back slowly. This is what I see. And Petrenko versus Betkili, I was very surprised.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, me too, really. Because Petrenko has too much power here. And he turns too much the pronation and he can't push too much.
SPEAKER_02: I expected a closer match, but he was too much. Big respect to Pat Keighley, he did an incredible job. There will be more matches for him as well, but Petrenko for 95 kilos, he looked very dangerous. Let's go to Irakli vs. Tata. I really never expected this.
SPEAKER_03: My moment was on Irakli, really, because I saw him super strong in this last period. He did good, for sure. But I think his weakness with Todd is this. Because he's not like, you know, top roller with the top roller. But about this, he lost.
SPEAKER_02: Engie, where are you? I don't know. He just left. I don't know how it happened, you know. Okay. So, yeah, Petrenko for 95 kilos. Okay, Tata Shinks versus Irakli. Yeah, I paid...
SPEAKER_03: Todačin for Irakli or Ongarbaev is a super-dangerous opponent because he pulled in his weakness of Irakli and Ongarbaev, many, many athletes. Because you need more risk with Todačin. You need to do something like he did with Prunik the first time.
SPEAKER_02: You need to take his pronation. If you don't take his pronation, he will pull this way forever. Two guys at the East versus West and also Haji Murat beat him. But like Pruetnik was able to beat him and Darikian was able to beat him. They both really had the full cup over. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. I love AOC. Hermes, my friend, would you still beat Vitaly today? Yes, why not? People think maybe he's too strong. Why? Me, I continue to training and I think maybe better than last time because
SPEAKER_03: My hand and wrist is stronger every month because I started to train my hand and everything a lot. When you know how to beat someone, it's easier the next time than the last time.
SPEAKER_03: Listen, so does it apply between you and Levent? No, me? No, I know. Yeah, OK, OK. Be careful what you say. Yeah, yeah. But Vitaly is super, super strong. For sure it will be a hard match. But really, I'm confident with him if we have a rematch.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we will come to his match against Morozov. It was incredible, incredible. Nobody expected this. Yeah, we will come there. Todd Hutchings versus Irakli. Todd said that he was going to top-roll Irakli, and Irakli was laughing, but he really top-rolled him. He took his risk. And so I see that this is another match that Irakli lost.
SPEAKER_02: And all of them are against the top role, like Ongarbev, like Ongarbev-Dadikian. Yeah. And now also, like, so do you think that, like, Iraqis should worry instead of this? You think it should be more all the time? Yeah, he needed more child than only top role.
SPEAKER_03: And then Devon versus Gennady. You talk about this on your channel. Yeah, I say it many times. Before, I really didn't show too much because there are a lot of complaints about this. After this, I showed the match. It was also Gennady who made some mistakes. But Devon basically was stronger, right? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: any possibility Gennady to win that match except like stopping for like yeah sure first round he went immediately in the down he yeah I think the rounds that Gennady tried to do this it was easier for because he blocked and then he turned his opponent but the rounds that he went inside and died he was able to stop maybe bring even near to center but he was not able to
SPEAKER_03: Yes, I saw the match three days ago but it was not close. And how about Michael versus Ermes Gasparini? The best match of the night. All times or all the night? No, all the night. All the night, best match? Yes. Which one was better, your match?
SPEAKER_02: Morozov versus Vitaly. Morozov, really amazing. First round, amazing. Really unbelievable. Yeah. There is one guy who is asking me, Polonius Engin, do you think you can beat Travis today? No. But I beat him 24 years ago with left arm. I flashed him so bad that his feet from other side went up, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, if I find a video, I heard that he's paying people not to show the video. Okay, so let's talk about the match. Morozov versus Vitaly. A lot of people talk shit about Morozov. They said that, you know, he's not strong. Because they expected it was the same like a right hand, you know. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But really super impressive when he holded him. And he got injured and still he continued to pull. You saw his elbow, right? The first pulling match was more or less the same when I fought with Larriton with the right hand. I holded him because Larriton's side pressure was crazy, really.
SPEAKER_03: and to take his risk is super difficult in the beginning. I think he did a very good move to do this technique. You guys don't need to delete opinions, as long as it's not disrespectful, guys. Please, just keep it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there was a super chat or something. Sorry about it, but where was it? I kind of miss it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Listen, like a lot of people are asking me, like, Engin, Irakli, sometimes with Levan in the practice, how did he lose to Tata Sings? You know, they don't understand, you know, they don't understand the difference.
SPEAKER_03: or practice, the difference about the off-season, if the guy is tired, if it's only practice or not. Because maybe in the practice, maybe you trained two days ago and you are 50% of your power. Maybe it's the end of training. Maybe there are many, many, many options. In the real fight, both athletes, they are fresh.
SPEAKER_02: You saw that, right? Irakli, after the king of the table, at the side table, he was beating Laletin. Yeah, yeah. And now Tataşin, Tataşin stopped rolling. Irakli is incredible. Irakli is great. But the practice is practice. Like, I'm curious, you know, like, how many people would put money on Irakli against Vitalik if it was competition? Would you bet on Irakli?
SPEAKER_02: He's with the competition. Nobody. No, but everyone is saying that he beat him. So what I'm just saying, the practice is practice. So Devon performing against Morozov and this and that, and then they say this and that, but that is not the thing. I mean, Devon, I'm sure he's great, and I think he's going to climb rankings, but first he needs to beat Corey West, and a lot of people underestimate Corey West, but Corey is a very tough guy.
SPEAKER_03: And I will tell you something you will not believe. I think Corey West would beat you, left arm, Hermes. I think, yes. Yeah, because of the strong side pressure. I think your arm... My left, I don't know why, every time problem here, the elbow. Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. Maybe in the future, I don't know what I need to do. But left, I was really not too much lucky.
SPEAKER_03: to fight with the number one and number three in the world immediately. Immediately with the strongest guy. There is a question for you. Do you think Mattia Vezola will beat Samusha? No, my friend. Maybe in the future, but for now, impossible.
SPEAKER_02: I agree. And let's talk about the matches that I announced. And we talked about already John match and we talked about Devon match and Dave Chaffee
SPEAKER_02: I'm not saying he's going to win, but if anyone says that he's not dangerous, first of all, the one thing that
SPEAKER_02: Georgi Svetkov doesn't like is the side pressure. He doesn't like the side pressure. That is how Alex Kordesha pulled him, but of course his feet was, ankle was hurt. And the one thing that David Sheffy has a lot is side pressure, like start of the match. And... I don't remember nobody taking the center with him.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, usually, yeah. So, he started doing this. And if he gets the center, and then his wrist fails, and then if he puts the shoulder, I think we will see a big war. Because it is not easy to press Georgi Svetko either. So, I'm expecting a 50-50 match. It can go, like, anyone who is thinking it's an easy match, I kind of disagree. But who knows, you know.
SPEAKER_03: How do you see it? I see... Yes, like what you said. If you have the press, if the match will go harder and longer, he will win, I think. Not being a favourite.
SPEAKER_02: But does it depend on what position the matches are? Here, I understand, he's going to work, work. But what if his wrist stays neutral and then he gets side pressure here and then from here he does the transition, the shoulder pressure. Do you think that if that is the case, you are sure that Georgi is going to win?
SPEAKER_02: If Gheorghe is in a losing position and they push the shoulder, do you think that for sure Gheorghe is going to win? No, no, no. If Cefi will use the pressure, Gheorghe will lose for sure. But it needs to be in the winning position. If Gheorghe takes the center, then it will be very hard, right? Do you remember one round that Vitaly and Dave, the last round, they went to strap and then Dave stopped and then...
SPEAKER_02: he did the press still 5-0 la retinue was winning but all the wins he won like it was without the strap so once in the sky again you know they won you know he's super strong yeah and then dave says that greatly he's healthier than before oh okay yeah i don't know my friend i don't know what we will see and
SPEAKER_02: What do you think? You are saying that if Michael Todd and Vitaly Laletin, just say that I set them in May, who's winning? Just say. I didn't set the match. I didn't set the match. But who's winning that match? I knew Devon with Laletin. No, no. I'm not saying that I will set. Maybe Devon will put Laletin. But I'm going to go one after another. So Laletin posted the photo between them.
SPEAKER_03: That's not what I'm asking. I will ask the same question. I'm just asking you, just say, it's not real, but just say that it might be true. Like, how do you feel? Laiti will be in very big trouble. But maybe, I think 50-50, really, because if Laiti, he can, with his leverage, he can climb like crazy. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: he can win because he doesn't have a strong press. But he can't climb too much and his endurance will go down. You are saying that if he cannot do everything, if he cannot take everything, then Michael is going to win. Yeah, that's what you are saying. But you are saying that the possibility of that is 50-50.
SPEAKER_02: 50-50, really super-future fight. Okay, let's go to now Devon versus Vitaly. Do you think this is a harder match for Vitaly or easier match for Vitaly, technically? Same, more or less. Same, more or less, okay. Who do you think has better defense here?
SPEAKER_03: Michael Todd about defense is the best, I think, in the world. But there is a possibility that maybe they will have better hands against... Yeah, I think about the hand, leverage is longer, the arm is longer, I think. About the hand, control,
SPEAKER_03: Devon is stronger, for sure. Hand control? Hand control, pronation here. He's stronger than Vitaly? I think yes. Not too much, but a little bit more for sure. Besides pressure, power here, he's a lot stronger.
SPEAKER_02: and the the the the speed of this okay question they this is vitally this is the one don't move ready go now what risk position they have it go okay this is devon this vitally yeah here we go here this devil this crap
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Devon, he will do this. La Letty will go like this. But he will continue with the side pressure. Devon will be like this, like Barroso or me. So you are saying that Devon possibly will take La Letty's wrist? Little bit, yes. But La Letty will have the pronator. Pronator here. He will continue like this. Like the way that he continued against Morozov? Exactly.
SPEAKER_03: Here it depends if Devon has enough arm power to stop him or not. It's only about this. And I saw he started to do some press, but he's not strong enough, I think, to beat Devon in the defense position. Listen, listen, when you talk about the press, what kind of world is it that we tell Laletin shoulder press?
SPEAKER_03: Morozov. I never expected. Do you think that this happened because Morozov got injured early round? Or do you think that... No, no, no. I think Lali started to train. I think the press is something about genetics. You need to have genetic movement. I think Vitaly didn't have this genetic movement. But he started to train this...
SPEAKER_03: this movement and if the match will be very long and both are very tired, this will help him for sure. And Lallatin's endurance is very strong because with Morozov, he pushed like crazy. I never saw... Listen, listen, listen. I don't understand that part. When you say Lallatin's endurance is super good, like usually Lallatin
SPEAKER_02: lost to matches which are long. He lost against Dave Sheffield, he lost against... With Morozov, he was better. Yeah, he was, but this is why I'm saying that. Do you think that, that's why I'm saying that, do you think that maybe, possibly, Morozov, like, you saw that elbow picture, right? Does it have anything to do, not to take anything away from Laletin, Laletin is incredible, 100% deserved to win, you know?
SPEAKER_03: And I am amazed by both athletes. Maybe this put more problem to Morozov, but the way what they said, now I don't know because I don't feel what they said to Morozov. But... I'm not 100% sure about Lalletin's right arm press and right arm...
SPEAKER_03: Right arm press and right arm endurance. I don't know how it is working. Left one arm having endurance, other one not. Or you think he increased his endurance? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You think that? Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He pushed really... When someone stops you and starts to talk with you, you know, and your mentality will go down a little bit, but he never...
SPEAKER_02: he never gave up and he continued to push it like like like crazy crazy and more also lost a little bit uh concentration you know his his concentration was a little bit you know laughing do you know why he did that i think he was very happy because he was afraid to be flash pinned like exactly more than anything
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, in this match, there is nothing to worry about. Even the guy who lost can be proud of himself. Exactly, because Morozov, after one match like this, I think in his mind, okay, I'm done, that's it for me. For me, this is enough.
SPEAKER_03: for me because you know he he he had a lot of haters about devon the practice you know and many people told to him your wrist is weaker you don't are number one blah blah blah blah but he proved
SPEAKER_03: he was super amazing strong and everybody said this all the athletes all the fans he said that he received a lot of messages that people apologized him you know they said sorry but you are very good and things like that it's good it's good it's good like everyone can make mistakes it's important yeah yeah yeah for sure for sure yeah and yes it was amazing and i think devon with the loyalty to be
SPEAKER_03: more or less like this. But it depends if Devon can stop him. I think he can. But it will be a close fight.
SPEAKER_03: the leverage of lighting make a lot of problem in the wrist of Devon and maybe the lighting can take take the wrist a little bit of Devon we don't know yeah yeah yeah but all the people want to see this fight all the people are super excited about this fight okay my opinion is that uh there is a possibility lighting they have control and win and there is a possibility that
SPEAKER_02: Neither of them have super control, and it's a long match. And that long match, like more, a little bit more favorable to Devon's side if the match is longer. And then there is also a possibility Devon to have the hand-wrestle control over Larrison. But my opinion... Huh?
SPEAKER_03: I think it will be 50-50. And another question to you. What if Michael and Devon push? I think Devon, I think he is confident. But I saw his match in King of the Table. He took his pronation. But I don't think he can now. Because here we...
SPEAKER_03: My wrist now to do this is super strong, and my side pressure is super strong. But I felt like... Was it stronger than you expected? Yeah. My explanation? Yeah, too much. Okay, so you are saying that even if Devon wins, it wouldn't be as easy as... He's doing 90 kilos, 95 kilos, I don't know, here.
SPEAKER_03: You can have all the things, one block, but the pronation or hold or not hold here. You don't have another option. That's why I can't take his...
SPEAKER_03: But it will be a very good match. Michael Todd has a lot of matches to do, I think. Super interesting to see. Really, he can prove a lot.
SPEAKER_02: Uh-huh. Question. Like, Laletin's tall forearm that he has long reach, you know, to follow, like, someone like Michael, you know, is it advantage or disadvantage against Michael?
SPEAKER_02: Advantage. It's advantage. Yeah, because the more hand you have, the stronger your wrist. So you are saying that the more you can reach, you leave no space for the guy to go because you can reach. Exactly. You can turn his arm better. For me, it was impossible to do this. I understand. I understand. Usik sent a super chat with our message. Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_02: Guys, I don't know, some of you may not like me. I know most of you do like me because of the things that I have done for the sport.

Do you want to say anything?
SPEAKER_03: I said before, I saw a lot of support, a lot of very beautiful messages in this period. Really, this gave me a lot of motivation to train more harder and to prove more things. And I'm really happy and I will enjoy this moment.
SPEAKER_03: And of course, you know, it's not usually to have the match with Lewand to have this experience. It's a very beautiful experience, you know, the training camp and the competition. And I feel really something special inside and I think something will happen. Very special. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so Hermes, my friend, there is one more Superchat before we close. Doretto says, if Hermes beats Levan, will Levan get a rematch right away or would Devon and Vitaly have to compete for title shots? My friend, if Hermes beats Levan, if Levan wants, for sure he's going to get a rematch. Levan is the guy.
SPEAKER_02: that deserves it like if leon wants a rematch then i will give him um unless hermes dominates him which i don't think is possible imagine my brain think about i will top roll him and then let's go my friend yeah
SPEAKER_02: yeah listen listen even even if you see that that you hold him levan and beat him like this and then even if he's like if it's a dream he would wake up he was like what a stupid dream he was yeah anyways yeah anyways guys ermes once again my friend thank you very very much my friend and you are always a positive addition
