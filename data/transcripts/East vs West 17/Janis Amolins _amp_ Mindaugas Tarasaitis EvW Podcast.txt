SPEAKER_00: Hmm. That's interesting. I asked Dexter and said that everyone should have received the tracking numbers by now, but best natured. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: 50-50. This match is 50-50. Stone, Gamer. John, see, I would buy even if it were, I would buy pay-per-view even if it were only this match. Yes, that is, I don't understand, you know, like, there are many matches. I would watch, I would pay $20 to watch John Burzing versus Kanai match.
SPEAKER_00: Or like Dave Chappie versus Gyorgy Svetko. Or Devon versus Corey. These are all great matches. The lucky ones podcast females in arm wrestling. Can we have one more ladies match in East versus West 17? The card is absolutely amazing. Looking forward to every match. I just barely added one more match.
SPEAKER_00: today between Hunter North and Minda Agostarasaitis Left Town. Yes, my friend, there is a transition. Yeah, process is now different. Yeah, that is why, you know, it would be good if you wait a little bit. Hello, Yanis. Hello. How are you? Thank you. Thank you. Fine. How are you?
SPEAKER_00: good good good good good i was just waiting for you guys and chatting with the arm wrestling fans and so myself let me see it's left arm okay yeah that's better how are you you feeling healthy uh i'm fine i'm fine a little bit tired busy day running are you busy because just like
SPEAKER_02: Going around because it's Sunday or still working? No, no, no, it's not a working day but I had some things to do, some stuff to do and also daughter had basketball tournament so I had to visit two games and son had soccer football tournament and I had to win like six months ago. He had tournament Friday, Saturday, Sunday, three days tournament and
SPEAKER_00: other stuff as well had to do some things with family and so yeah that's it's like it's not busy not working but very busy yeah yeah yeah but it's yeah that's good that's good yeah good yeah so yeah otherwise fine how is how is the preparation against the god
SPEAKER_00: Who are you calling a GOAT? Not my GOAT, but it is the GOAT of the fans on social media. I don't know where it came from. Let's ask him, he just came. I believe me and Ray, we made it up. Oh, you guys made it up? OK. Hello, guys, hello.
SPEAKER_00: Is there any possibility for us to turn your volume up? Not the volume of the phone, I'm talking about your volume. My voice, right? Yeah. I'm joking. I mean volume, okay. Yeah, like Yanis.
SPEAKER_00: Did you know that Giannis just disrespected you right before you came? I said, how is the preparation going against God? And he said, who do you call God? Like, can you believe that? Yeah, Giannis doesn't like that. Yeah, he's jealous of you. That is what it is. Otherwise, he wouldn't ask. He's hoping to have that title, but unfortunately, yeah, not going to happen. So...
SPEAKER_01: But, yeah, guys, good to be here. I'm ready for some good armwrestling discussion. The king of Baltic. Oh, yeah, that's a good point, good point. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess me and Yanis were somehow enemies on the table for quite a while. You guys haven't... Sorry, Yanis, go ahead.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I just believe that you or your wife are more often guests in Baltics than Mindaugas. I'm not sure how often he... He just came from there today. Okay. But yeah, somehow I'm not able to show up at the Baltic competitions lately for quite a few years. I don't know why. Even the Lithuanian nationals are
SPEAKER_01: I'm always aiming to go to them. Some kind of East vs. West event always pops up. You haven't done Lithuanian Nationals for the last two or three years? I think so, yeah. Not on purpose, really not on purpose. Every single time I'm trying to come and then it's either arm wars or East vs. West or something like that.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's on purpose. Last time he lost again, the guy, what's the guy's name? He's playing... Yeah, so that is, he just doesn't want to pull that guy. He lost two times, maybe, no? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sharunas, like, he kept defending his title very well. And, yeah, same with you, Yanis. I guess last time we met, officially, you did beat me, so...
SPEAKER_02: uh yeah i know what probably that's the only reason you are looking forward all the time this fight oh i i thought last time you guys pulled mindago's one you won the last time janice yes oh that was long time ago it was so long ago that it even doesn't matter it was 2000
SPEAKER_02: 17 or I think so. Yeah, it's long time we haven't pulled. It's long time in competition. We have done some table practice. We did table practice in Copenhagen a year ago and then probably like two years before that in Lithuania, in Europe in some side table and similar as well, but on competition.
SPEAKER_02: Also in Riga maybe 2019 or 20, something like that. Many times, many times we have done some practice together or side table or so, but competition it was 2017 in Riga. It was good competition, it was you, Vladislav Skrzewski, me, who else, who else? It was good class, it was good class.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think something was wrong with me on that day. I remember it didn't go well at all. That's what we all say when we lose, that something was wrong. That's what we say. Something was wrong. I am kind of wondering now how much better is Yanis during the official competition in comparison to the practice session. And I'm expecting him to be quite a bit better.
SPEAKER_01: But yeah, I don't know. What do you think? Are you better? I believe I have some always
SPEAKER_02: kind of ability to to get a little bit more out of me when it's necessary but of course it's not like you can be 20 or 30 percent stronger probably it's uh it's just little but sometimes that's little is enough but yeah it's uh it is and that's i believe uh ability of most great great athletes or champions that when it's necessary they can push a little bit more and and find that small
SPEAKER_00: small small uh necessary strength or necessary some energy in there i don't know where i i think i think that that yeah that that's but it may be for a few a few reasons like one is you have seen that peak but you like you have that in the memory that that peak but but because you can't be motivated all the time
SPEAKER_00: you don't push it to there all the time. And, but whenever it is necessary, you have that, you have that in the gas tank, you know, that little bit thing, you know, like, you understand, like right now, if I pull here, like training is different. If I just need to do one time, you understand, I can really hit hard because that is there, but I can't, I don't have the endurance of it if I'm not training.
SPEAKER_02: So I think it's also about the mindset as well. I think for you, Yanis... It's mostly about mindset. It's mostly about that, yeah. It's mostly. It's not like you really can't really add 20-30% of your one rep max. No, it's not real. It's mostly like how much your neural system is ready in that moment, how much you can push out of yourself. And probably more brains than muscles.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but I think there is something in the memory that you have reached there before. You have done it before and you are just repeating that thing, you know, but you are choosing the right time, you know, if that is worth to do that or not. That's what I think, you know, and also like injuries, you know, like you may be injured and then you may not be injured then.
SPEAKER_00: a lot of things are changing 10-15% like because if you are not using some muscle groups because you are injured then you are not only hurt but because of not being able to train that area it also gets weaker with time yeah and once it gets weaker now you need to use some other muscle groups and I think they are getting damaged even more because you are not getting help from the
SPEAKER_00: all the other muscle groups that are injured, you know? So, and then you are just cornered, you know?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's true. It's like when you have some injury and after that, sometimes people ask, how are you? Is it still painful? And you can say, no, it's not painful. It's maybe a little bit sensitive. But the thing is, if you haven't trained that properly for some months or even longer, it's still weak. It's not about pain. It's a question about that it's not ready to show any serious result. And especially if you want to become the best in the world, you need every bit of these things, you know.
SPEAKER_00: be you can't be limited and become the best in the world especially today at this level um which is like very hard there are two super chats todd and oleg's love child greatest promoter strongest pronator thank you this guy is always having the same message and yeah i don't know what to say i i can say yes um boss royal engine what does oh
SPEAKER_00: That is not something good, you know. Anyways, Minde is getting his ass whooped two times in one day. Ooh. Is that true? Yeah. Or zero times. We will see. The question is that, do you think that if Giannis beats you, he will become God? No, so let's not pretend like Giannis has a chance. Like, we don't need to...
SPEAKER_00: Play those kind of games. I mean, even Yanis yourself, like if we are realistic, I guess we know what's going to happen, right? He's playing mind games. He was playing the same exact game when I had the Supermatch with him, you know? Yeah, just be honest for a moment. Just be honest to the camera for a moment.
SPEAKER_00: uh what do you you're asking janice you're asking yeah what does he really expect like listen i will ask you something would janice accept such match if he really would think that way so you are saying that i called janice and janice said oh okay let me go uh arlington and lose so that they got this is you are thinking right no what i'm thinking is that yes janice maybe healed up some of his injuries which is great that gives me him confidence
SPEAKER_01: And yes, maybe he was still able to train pretty well, and maybe he added some amount of power on top of that, which is, again, great. But me knowing what I felt before Vivianis, even that extra maybe 20% is not going to save him. Oh, listen, if he has recently gained 20%, that's a lot.
SPEAKER_00: You are saying that, just say for example, when you guys pull at the WAF wars 2022, at that time you were 20% stronger and now he increased 20% and you are still stronger or how do you calculate those things? Engin, you have no idea how much good high quality meat I ate since 2022.
SPEAKER_02: oh it's a big difference right now big difference i will i believe there are many people who have eaten much more of i don't know anything but uh it's not making them uh strongest armistlers in the world but it's good to it's good to have confidence it's good to have confidence and i can say that uh uh people who
SPEAKER_02: who don't have doubts in there. They are always wrong. You need to have some doubts. And I'm always very realistic about my chances. And with all that, how often you have been competing lately, how good you have done, probably that's very, very fair that you say that you are favorite. It's okay. I'm fine with that. It's no problem. And it takes all the pressure away from you, right? Like, oh, okay, yeah, he's the favorite, you know.
SPEAKER_02: i think we are in agreement here we are in agreement here yes yes every fight starts uh starts from zero and then and we will see what the day will show and uh and i somehow think that at the end all will be fine at the end all will be fine and uh if not then then maybe that's not the end so we will see no yes it will for sure be fine and especially since you are starting to kind of uh
SPEAKER_01: admit you know that you are not a favorite here i think it will really help you to quickly like during the match you'll quickly realize that okay maybe it's not worth trying too hard here because the outcome is still going to be the same so yeah it's great um at the end i think we will both be happy and we will admit that yes one of us is just better yeah
SPEAKER_02: I have often said that there are many people who can talk and all that confidence that I will beat you. But in reality, sport is sport, we know.
SPEAKER_02: Of course, probably what we can only talk about in real life is results, what we have seen, like our previous fights, what you have done, what I have done, some training results, where we have some thoughts about how it went. And then lately, probably for you, I think Ray was last weekend in Copenhagen, so yeah,
SPEAKER_02: That was not very, I would say, promising for Ray or for me when Ray said that he was trying to pin you for three days and he couldn't. That's probably not a good message for me. Ramos was lying. We were just training.
SPEAKER_02: You know, a training session is never real or anything like that, so you cannot take it seriously. It's not going to be anything for me because you were pulling Ray, not me. And the thing that you couldn't... that Ray couldn't pin you doesn't mean that I will not pin you. It's different. Exactly. Exactly, exactly, Yanis. Yeah, don't fall into his mind games, you know.
SPEAKER_00: He's just playing with the wrong person. He thinks that you are just an amateur with his mind games. Let's be honest for a minute. Tell the camera that you don't have a chance. I mean, come on. It's time to humble this guy. Please do that. Please do that. Don't make me do that again. I will start from the beginning. The thing is, of course, for me to accept a fight four weeks before a fight, it's quite
SPEAKER_02: a short it's it's not really time for me to train specially or prepare but but before that of course I was not sleeping I was not out of training so I'm always active and it's not making big difference four weeks or eight weeks I'm still training it's it's harder to make some peak for your shape but still
SPEAKER_02: That's okay. And probably more important for me is not to overdo or not to do too much because that's what you can do in the last few weeks. You can ruin everything. For me right now, it's just...
SPEAKER_02: train train like it is and then be fresh and as healthy and as uh in good good spirit as it possible of course i would prefer to get a baby a little bit healthier or stronger after my injury it's just six months ago and uh directly first fight against first super much against uh mindy probably is not great option because uh i was injured in position where mindy is strong but with all that with all that
SPEAKER_00: I believe I have a very good chance to beat Mindy. Yanis, what does the very good chance mean? With the number, what does the very good chance mean? Some percentage? I have no idea. But it's not less than 50, right?
SPEAKER_02: I believe it's very close and similar like I said before my fight with Justin that it's like fight starts 0-0 and I think I have same as good chance as Mindaugas.
SPEAKER_02: How it will be, it's just a guessing, it's just a guessing. But we can have some facts. I pulled Justin Bishop, I won 2-3 against Stu. And that's my only fight in East-West. Minder pulled Justin as well and he also won 3-2. But yeah, it was a very interesting match. Your match with Justin, listen, who did I ask? I asked Pauline.
SPEAKER_00: Pauline said to me that Justin that pulled against you, Yanis, was in a better shape than Justin that was against Minda. Minda pulled Justin like after long retirement and then like two months training or something.
SPEAKER_00: And you pulled Justin when he said that he's extremely ready. So it just means that you're going to destroy this guy. Justin said the same thing to me, that he was much stronger and in much better shape against me than he was against Minder. Minder, Minder, just be honest and accept. Just tell us that you don't have any chance. See, like all the math... Let's try to... Okay, that's quite a logical...
SPEAKER_01: argument i would say yes um but just fair enough but janice so what about let's say what's happening in your mind uh if we had some training sessions which are of course they don't mean much but maybe let's say i was just a little bit better at the time did something change since then like do you have like did you heal up some injuries or did you no no he had a lot of meat like you did
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so I wonder why does he think maybe now it's going to be better for him? Did you not say that since 2022 you ate a lot of red meat or something? Yeah, I did. Yeah, Yanis has been doing the same thing. I think Yanis is actually not eating enough meat and fat. Yanis needs a little bit more fat. I actually think if I could teach Yanis a little bit,
SPEAKER_01: I could really bring the best out of Jens and I think he could be maybe, let's say, 30% better. 30%. Naturally, just a good diet. What are you going to teach him just by diet? Just diet, diet a lot. Imagine that you are teaching that to... Maybe also a few training exercises in the gym. So what you are saying, like if...
SPEAKER_02: majority of all elite armwrestlers would eat same diet as you are eating they would be 30 percent stronger it doesn't have to be the same but you know we look at the situation and then we can i'm sure i can improve your situation a little bit in in a in a how short or long time we are talking like okay we take right now we will take uh engine
SPEAKER_00: And in how long time you will make him 30% stronger? He doesn't need me to beat him when he's doing it with two hands. So no need for me to do it. It does take some patience. You know, it's not magic. We are doing it naturally. So it does take a year or two actually. You are joking, right? No. So you are saying it like eating, you're going to write and then...
SPEAKER_00: We all will be 30%, up to 30%. Not all of us. Maybe some of us are good at managing everything, but I can see Yannis being a little bit too skinny. He needs a little bit more fat in his diet. So do you think that if you do this dieting more, you can beat Arthur Macaro? You can win one round? Super much? I can already beat Arthur Macaro right now. I just need the opportunity. That's it. Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but what if it ends up like last time? Listen, I can find you the opponent if you want to pull him. I'm sure it will happen. No, no, I can find you the Turkish guy you can pull.
SPEAKER_02: you on i mean yeah yeah like you know let's finish yeah this and then we will move on yeah wait a minute do you do you uh really believe that right now you are like uh strongest arm wrestler i don't know under 77 or under 80 or what in the world that you are the strongest one you are the number one yes it was not like that let's say six months ago it may well maybe not like that i was maybe doing a little bit too much jiu-jitsu in my free time which was uh
SPEAKER_02: of making me weaker at armwrestling but now jujitsu is a little bit on the side so uh it's very different i think currently there is no one stronger in the world in a world like you under 80 kilo let's say 77 since that's the weight class okay and if i will if i win you in usa then then i am the strongest one in the world under 77. in my mind yes
SPEAKER_01: Uh, that of course people might not believe it, so you might have to prove it to everyone else as well. But if you do beat me, then you will, then I will take it as you being a champ.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. I like challenges and I like to win against strong shape athletes. That's good. That's good. I prefer to pull you right now or not when you say that, okay, I'm in bad shape and sick or whatever. That's good. That's good. That's what I want. Yeah, two champions are talking. There is a super champion. I think we know that Yanis is also in a good shape right now. We all know that.
SPEAKER_00: so yeah yeah but but listen i have a super chat my eyes are not that good but can you help me to uh read that um i have a super chat uh how many times did you beat me though it's just maybe one or two like uh
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, actually 12 pins. We don't count the pins, you know, it was one day, so basically... 12 pins, yeah. One day, right arm, one left arm, Zlotitur, I beat you, I beat you at the Europeans, and anyway, so... Why your voice shakes when Engin asks you to pull him?
SPEAKER_00: Ah, was I in what? Why is your voice shaking when Engin tells you to pull against him? Sorry, one more time. No, no, this guy is thinking that your voice is shaking when the subject is competing. But I don't believe that. I don't believe that. So don't be provoked. Don't be provoked. My physical shape was the worst when I pulled Engin.
SPEAKER_00: oh yeah at that time your top row makaro almost won the wars and then i won the zloty with whatever and then yeah okay okay no i should not do that like i should not diminish your victory yeah so but again please come back so i can i will come back and you know what you know i i i have been trying to motivate myself i'm saying i need to go maybe i
SPEAKER_00: Samusha and then I realized like why I cannot continue training I said I cannot because I said Samusha is a goal and I know it's very hard even I take his wrist pinning will be hard and starting two days ago I said I'm gonna go and pull Minda I was my motivation is right there it's not going anywhere
SPEAKER_01: All right, so that's good. So you see, and I'm actually very, very happy that Yanis is giving me this opportunity to kind of check that box because, you know, we might not see Yanis anymore after that match. So, you know, I'm just glad about him finally being brave enough and we can have a match and then I beat him and then it's clear. And then after that, I really, I still need Engin to finally collect himself and...
SPEAKER_02: Is there any reason why I would somewhere go away after this fight? Is there any reason or what?
SPEAKER_02: In his head, in his imagination, he's thinking that way. He just thinks it's a PlayStation game, you just boom, boom, eliminate the guys. Because I have seen you, it doesn't matter, it's sport, you win or lose, but probably you stand up and you go forward. And I have seen you losing against Makaro, I have seen you losing against...
SPEAKER_01: Nur Delet, I have seen you lose against some other guys or Kristaps Sinewaff-Vold or whatever, but you are still here. Yeah, but you see, it really depends on how you lose. And if you lose in a really, really bad way, while you were in a really, really good shape,
SPEAKER_01: like it creates some kind of existential crisis for you. Like, so psychologically it might, you know, there's such a thing where like, it's like, you start to think like, why am I really doing it? And is it really worth it? And why, you know? So I think it might happen. If we turn it opposite, when you are talking that you are right now, number one in the world, stronger than ever, and no one can touch you, then if you will lose, what will happen?
SPEAKER_01: No, for me, I'm much stronger mentally, so it doesn't matter. I just go back to training and I win again next time. So you do really believe that you can lose as well right now, you said. Then you will go back to training. Okay, I like it, I like it. Well, anything can happen, of course. That is just very unlikely. My kind of logic, you know, my armwrestling math,
SPEAKER_01: uh is including all the advantages which you might have which means like super good shape no injuries um yes just extra power which i did not feel before at all and then even in that case according to my calculations i'm still okay so so i feel pretty safe good good good good
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, can I ask you guys the question, honestly, do you guys, do you guys realize whenever I pull Arthur Makaro second time, do you guys realize when I got injured? Like exactly what, what, what round and what position I get injured? I remember I could see the exact moment when you were starting to act, act like you were injured. Uh, what do you mean by act?
SPEAKER_00: Well... You've never seen my bicep? I can show you now. You've never seen it, seriously? No, okay. No, I'm joking. I'm joking. Oh, okay. Please, be serious. I'm just asking. Do you know how that happened? How that happened is that round one was okay. Round two, he was too close. And whenever I was training with Yusuf,
SPEAKER_00: Time to time, when he was doing two hands, both hands, I couldn't pin him, but I was stopping him. But I couldn't. But whenever I put my right foot to the corner or the other side, the table leg, and then I was opening him. But I haven't done that in my career. You have never seen me, Yanis, putting my foot, yeah. And this round, whenever he closed, I said, let me try. And then I put my foot there, and I
SPEAKER_00: to pull him so hard and even in strap, his fingers went like slide like here, like inside of my hand. But whenever you take everything and there is no resistance here,
SPEAKER_00: What you are doing is that you are pulling his left, his elbow from the pad, because there is no resistance on the hand anymore. And then his, you know, his left, you remember when you pulled him, you said that, remember one round that you beat him at the final? You remember that once you were trying to pin him, at the last moment, he pulled his elbow back. It was really, you told me that it was very strong pressure.
SPEAKER_00: So I felt that his leg power, and then whenever I pull my foot there and pull, after a point, I pull him more than I had to. I needed to. And then I pull his legs, and then my bicep was like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. But I took everything. So I was able to bring my shoulder and pin him because he was like this. But the third round, when I was 2-0,
SPEAKER_01: Whenever we had to start from the, again, start, you know, normal start, my bicep just right away, it just went that way. Yeah. I think when you put your leg up, something changes a little bit. Some of the angles are changing a little bit. So maybe that's also the reason why, you know, it's not the position you are used to. Because, for example, when I'm always trying to kind of see if that works for me and it really never does work.
SPEAKER_00: Because somehow I'm feeling like I'm too offensive and I cannot safely go back to defense anymore. So, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, that was the first East versus West. I organized the event and I also pulled in the same event, you know. And it was really a bad experience, you know, for me, yeah. Anyway, so if you go back to your match together with Yanis, I saw...
SPEAKER_00: Jan is mentally very well prepared for this. He is not buying any of your, how to say, temptations, or I don't know what I should say. You just try to play the game, and I see him very confident. That's all I will say. I can sense some confidence from the screen as well.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exciting. I can sense some confidence from him as well. Yeah, that's good. I wouldn't want anyone to be
SPEAKER_02: like here mentally down you know what you were saying sorry we cut you know you said that i was not uh buying or what but uh but uh when when uh when we were talking about and you asked me about these fights and uh one of your best uh best uh sentences was it was like uh yeah you're honest you are not getting younger you have to yes yes yes
SPEAKER_00: Listen, I'm trying everything. You don't know what kind of games I'm playing. It's not about games, but I had to really remind him. First thing I asked him, how is your shape? He said, very good. And I think he said he did some weights, maybe even send video or
SPEAKER_00: I think he did. And he said that he's in good shape. I said, listen, if you are in good shape, you understand, then you are in good shape. We are not getting any younger. Today, you have good shape. Tomorrow, you may not have. I know from myself, Yanis is not as old as I am, and probably he's not as damaged as I am, not because he didn't have the wars that I had, but it is because he has taken care of himself much better than I have done. I treated my body like...
SPEAKER_00: He was warning me all the time, you need to do some stretching and this and that, while I was just like, no. And so he said, yeah, you're right. We are not getting any younger. And one of the reasons that now I'm training also, Yanis, is because the same reason. Maybe it's too late for me, but it's not too late for you. Some people say, oh, Tati is 58 years old.
SPEAKER_00: One, Todd is genetically, I think, very strong guy. And two, he started at his 35. So the mileage, just say 230,000, while I started around 16. So it is 340,000.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know, somehow I never buy this argument. Too late. Never too late to change something or start something new. Like, why not? But yeah, there was this joke about that you
SPEAKER_02: guy who will be hang on after like the next day and then this security guard asked him what he wanted like his last choice or last wish. He said like I want to learn to play violin and they're asking why but he's like
SPEAKER_00: when another day, if not now, so why not? So it's the same with everything. Yeah. If I were that guy, I would just say that I still didn't learn. Wait a little bit more. Yeah, but it's... If we are very, very, like, philosophic about that. Yeah. And you said that you never buy what? The old, get an old type of thing? No. I just think that
SPEAKER_01: but if you train in a smart way you can really do it almost forever meanwhile if you are working in a maybe you are rushing a little bit you want to win now and you don't have you don't have patience i think you can also kind of damage yourself in a year or two so i'm just saying that maybe yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yanis, by the way, is doing things correctly. He's going... Yes, but even he's hurt. He cannot tell me that he's totally healthy. Probably he has some problems as well. That's why I'm saying that he could improve. He could still improve. Oh, you're going to make him healthy, right? I could, if he wanted to. Yeah. How old are you, Mindaugas? I'm 33 years old. 33. Yeah, let's talk 15 years later. No problem. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he has been there before, so there's no problem. He knows it. He has been 48 before. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Time is running quick. We will see. We will see. But, no, of course, of course, arm wrestling is kind of strange sport where you can still be very competitive at some certain age. But, anyway, there is some limit for all of us anyway. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: yeah so a little bit a little bit about uh stylistically i i i watched mindaugas
SPEAKER_02: fight in arm wars with Tom Holland and I was also very, very surprised how good Mindy pulled in inside and hook because all those fights were really inside and it's a little bit like I will say some compliments for me in August but when people tell him that he's very technical or tactical and his ego is going
SPEAKER_02: it's it's all true it's all true but uh but the thing is uh probably he can do all those technical stuff because he's quite strong that's that's probably more true than uh some some special knowledge or some technical ability yeah in a way i'm quite i'm quite happy that my opponents are very often underestimating the power and thinking mostly about technique i think in the match between you and me janice
SPEAKER_01: I feel like I only need to have some kind of fair setup. I will try to stop you from getting too much advantage. And then I think it's just all power game, which I should be okay in.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't think there will be something you can do anything technical, which will surprise me. Really, it's more about strength. It's all about strength, who will have some strength to take advantage of opponents.
SPEAKER_02: position. Of course, I would love to have some fight and I like those fights where it's getting already more tactical and you have to think maybe what you need to change or what you do in some specific positions. That's always great. But anyway, mostly it will be about strength in some specific position from ready go. Can I ask you guys something like first to Yanis? Yanis, what is the
SPEAKER_00: weakness with Mindaugas. His weakness is also up to your strength point, right? If you ask Makaro what is the weakness of Mindaugas, he's going to say his hook. And then if you ask me, I'm going to say his wrist. So his weakness is up to the opponent's best part. So I think that for you,
SPEAKER_02: like what are you planning to do you don't you don't have to say it but what do you think the weakness but as an outside right that uh mindogas don't have really one weakness uh his his hand control his back pressure is great pronation control is very good and and he's known for his ability to take a hand and wrist and that's uh what he's doing most often but like i said in his previous fight he was pulling really good inside with tom holland who is known as a good inside arm wrestler and yeah
SPEAKER_02: Mindy won inside war and really good inside, what you don't expect from maybe top-roll armwrestler. So his inside game is really strong and also Ray said the same thing, that right now Mindy is strong inside as well.
SPEAKER_02: We have seen that Mindaugas can even pull without the hand again and without a wrist and you can do it yourself as well. Not one time, yes, the second time. But the thing is he can be very effective in any position. Yeah, you need to dominate him.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think he's a very well-rounded armwrestler and a very strong armwrestler. But you have to be stronger in one position. You need to find that one position where you are stronger. And that's my goal, to find that one position where I can be stronger and use it. And I'm a good enough armwrestler. If there will be that one position, I will find it. I will find. Okay, you will find it in Arlington or you already...
SPEAKER_02: No, no, of course I have my understanding what I have to do and what I will try to do. I have my understanding and I have my plan, but... Tell us, Yanis, let's be open, just tell us, what's the plan?
SPEAKER_00: You tell him. You tell him. You tell him exactly, Mindagöz. You tell him. Oh, no. Can I ask you something, Mindagöz, before you answer? When you come to Istanbul, do you remember we went outside to eat and I told you exactly what I will do to you? You don't remember, right? Probably I do. Yeah, probably. Yeah, yeah. I said, I'm going to do this to you. If you are strong enough, stop me. If you don't stop, yeah. We can be very open. Can you tell him the same thing, Yanis?
SPEAKER_01: I think we understand the game very well, so we can be very open. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We will see, the power will be the judge, basically. Okay, tell us, Vinagos. You said you can be open. So I know exactly where Giannis will go. And that's somehow the direction which I like the most. So that's great. Again, stylistically, I think that I'm going to enjoy that direction.
SPEAKER_01: And then Yanis is actually really dangerous if he, okay, maybe I will not be super, super open, but yeah, and this is super dangerous if he gets some technical details correctly and he will always try to get those things. So, but I have a perfect weapon to stop him from doing that basically. Um, yeah, well.
SPEAKER_00: i guess that's not very specific but okay okay we didn't get anything from you okay okay the question yanis if you said that he is very dangerous in hook he is dangerous even that way do you like for example do you believe that
SPEAKER_00: there is a possibility him to hook you one and there is a possible do you think that you took his wrist do you think that he can press you with the dead wrist these two questions i will ask first and then i will ask you one more uh first of all uh i will i will be open about what i will do and i will i will probably block him in this hand and take his pronator and and pin him to side but uh
SPEAKER_02: Can he hook me? It is a possibility. His hand is good and he could do that. I don't think that he will beat me without a hand and wrist. Inside, what he did against Tom Holland, it was very impressive. Or a great arm wrestler to pull inside. So his strength is definitely in very good level inside right now. But I don't think that Mendoza without a hand and wrist is dangerous for me. Yeah, but listen, having a good hook,
SPEAKER_02: And hooking a good top roller are not the same things. Absolutely, absolutely. We talk about when Tom Holland is giving up his pronator, absolutely. And then just trying to catch him defensively is a big difference. Or going here without any control. It's a big difference. But it's inside, of course. And like...
SPEAKER_02: I of course it was practice with ray but uh ray said that uh right like mindy without the hand is very strong as well and mindy when he gripped slow and uh like a dead move he's still very good and yes i have noticed that and i i know that so he is dangerous in all positions but uh is telling too much without a hand uh without a wrist yeah that's
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no. You have the tools to that. Yeah. Okay. So you are saying that basically probably he cannot hook you. He cannot press you with dead wrist. So he needs to take your wrist. And what if you guys both, you know, load, you know, you go back pressure and you both don't have the wrist like this, but didn't really lose the wrist, but just like flat wrist and pronation. Who is winning there?
SPEAKER_00: Yanis, tell him. Yanis, tell him. Listen, I have seen Yanis pulling in such positions more than I have seen you.
SPEAKER_02: If I will have a good enough back pressure control in that position, I'm okay with that and I like to pull in that position. If I have good enough back pressure control and I can control my pronation, it's fine. It's fine. Yeah, yeah. You don't have the full cup. You don't need the full cup. No, no. Because I have seen you some trainings you are doing with ladies clubs.
SPEAKER_00: that like normally you are like this but I have seen lately you doing that full back pressure that loading you know and then you go here but you don't have the cup but you stop with your brachioradialis you know so that that is a good
SPEAKER_02: counter for Mindaugas. To hold Mindaugas and do this, you really need a very strong wrist. Like you said, when we have some injuries, when we have some problems, we try to develop something else and probably that's how I'm pulling is because
SPEAKER_02: My wrist and hand was damaged and even if physically the injury is not that bad, mentally you still have some probably damage as well. And you try to use something else and it's working, it's working. For me, if you want to beat Mindaugas, for sure you need to make sure that he doesn't have that cup. Once he has that cup,
SPEAKER_00: I mean, he just multiplies that joint power, everything. Like I have seen he is having people like this and the next thing is just going like nothing except some against people like Prokopchuk. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And you, what's happening? You are so confident. You are just sitting there like a mafia boss, you know, like, you know, in all the blocks. And yeah, you are like, you know, tell him, Yanis, tell him, you know, you know. Yanis really has to take my risk like fully, like must be like this for him to survive.
SPEAKER_00: if it's at all flat a little bit like it's not gonna work yeah okay can you can you remind us like who did you beat like you and you and uh either hand you both didn't have the wrist you were like flat and either hand was able to have that he won that fight you you he didn't have the full cup using the full cup you both were like flat wrist
SPEAKER_00: His side pressure was better. I'm not saying Giannis can do the same or cannot do the same, but can you remind us who did you fight in such a way, having the pronator and then winning that way? For example, I know that some people when they top roll, for example, Giannis as well,
SPEAKER_01: lot more cupping than i do normally yeah maybe defensively but if you notice i i never really cup too much it's always just flat just kind of back pressure flat into the pad so i don't really ever really cup too much it's always just so that's why that's just you know that's my ideal scenario if janice apparently cannot cup so hard anymore maybe you know if janice wants to fight that middle game and just staying in the center
SPEAKER_00: It's great for me. I think it will be a very good war. Very good war. I think. Well, let's hope it will be for Giannis. I don't know. I don't know. Do you know why I think that? What was the guy's name again? I don't know. His name is... Somehow I just can't keep... Sarunas, right? Sarunas. Yeah, Sarunas. Yeah, Sarunas and you. Like, once you don't have that cup, you know, like...
SPEAKER_00: I think that you are losing like 30%. I don't know unless maybe you really improved that way. So I kind of think that you need to either have this or this or this. But here, if it is like, did you improve that part? Because Sarunas made your wrist flat like this, and then the rest was not so hard.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but a long time ago when I lost, I think Charlotte simply used to take my wrist. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but first he needs to make sure that you can cup. So once you cannot cup, I think that you are those type of guys, you know. Like, once you have this, incredible. But if you don't have cup here, I think your wrist is possible to... Of course, of course, right. Yeah. I mean, but if it's somewhat flat, that already means that I have everything I need. So...
SPEAKER_00: Say again? I don't think I need the cup. I just need it to be flat. If it is flat after the stop, I'm fine. Straight to the pad. No, no, I know you're fine, but can you give us some examples? Like big wins. Like you beat Cerkasov, you had this. You beat Daniel Prokopchuk, you had this. You have won that one round against Makarov, you had the full cup. Like usually... Against the top rollers, since, you know,
SPEAKER_01: uh, people who go inside, they kind of fall under me. And then like, even without trying, I, I kind of. Yeah. Against the top rollers. I think mostly I'm staying flat and just dragging back. And, um, I think that you are still like, you are still like having like, like this, it doesn't stay flat. I think that if, if you realize, well, okay. Just just
SPEAKER_01: Third time I'm asking you. I don't have any good examples. You couldn't have this and then Justin Bishop just beat you easy. You had a little bit of this, you beat Justin easy. You remember, right? It was the opposite. If off the go, Justin was super annoying and then he kind of took it a little bit, then it went. If it just stayed a little bit flat and he didn't take everything immediately, that was enough for me and then I was fine. But I thought that he also lost.
SPEAKER_01: But you know, he lost that fair battle. You know, whenever we got a good stop, flat wrist, I was not like this or anything, then it was immediately my way. But if I lost my wrist off the go because of him being annoying in the setup, then it didn't go well. So what I'm just saying that basically the key to beat you, make sure that you're like at the beginning. Once you have... Yeah, at the very beginning, take my wrist, basically. Yeah, you can do it.
SPEAKER_02: yeah janice normally does this but lately i see him he can he can really load you know but janice let janice answer that yeah yeah we will see we will see i i know i know all that and uh i'm uh i am i am watching arm wrestling and following a little bit so uh i have seen uh probably most of fights how mindy is losing and uh i have done my homework should we go to his traps immediately and
SPEAKER_01: Probably that would be smarter for our spectators, but how it will be, we will see. I will think about that. Are you going to try to get a pin with no strap and you will try to be quick like before, I remember? I'm not getting younger, you know. Let's not play those games just directly to the strap.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, probably it's a good option, we will see. But anyway, I think 100% that we will be in Strap in the first round anyway, and in all other rounds as well. I don't think that without Strap we can do anything to each other, so Strap will be the most important factor. Yes, yes, yes, Strap, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I am against forcing people to go to Strap, but I am all for it if both guys are one and dead. Just remember, some people think that Strap saves time, but there are a lot of matches that don't go. Ali Can and Matushenko, no Strap. Strap is needed when both guys want or when it is needed.
SPEAKER_00: necessary just that also changes the result of the matches like corey west versus tobias four rounds that tobias won as far as i remember without strap and two rounds that corey won in the strap yeah
SPEAKER_00: So we can't really eliminate the origin of the sport. But directly referee's grip, I think that's what we are going to do. Directly, no need to just play because people get bored. This is what I have been hearing from the fans. Those setups are just really killing, you know. And yeah. Anyway. So long, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So... Mindagos, what's your winning chance?
SPEAKER_01: Realistically, according to my Armorsling math calculations, it's 97%.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, actually 98. 98, yeah. Yeah, okay. I understand. Usually I use that 1, 2 when it is 51, 52, because I see very close, but I just think that this side a little bit, I say 52. But I don't know how you find it from 97 to 98 calculation. I'm sure that you are just trying to get on Yanis' nerves. Because 3%, it seems like a small chance, but 3% is quite a high chance.
SPEAKER_01: Like, it's one out of, what, 40-something, right? Three out of 100, yes, you mean. Yeah, so it's... Is it a big chance? Is it a big chance? I think 3% is a bit too high. I don't think Giannis has that chance. So 2%... You just want to be nice and you give me those three fights. Okay. Maybe, you know, things like injuries can still happen. Things like that might, you know...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, one in 50 chance that I get injured in a weird way and I lose. I can't wait. I can't wait. You know, you both know that this is a historical moment. I don't know how much every fan realizes.
SPEAKER_00: I think that the hardcore fans understand that this is a very important match. This is a match that we have been waiting for like 10 years. You can say that, oh, we put in this tournament or that tournament, but that is totally different. At that stage, at the East versus West stage, Yannis Amouris versus Mindaivas Tarasaitis, it is just like this level of match, this level.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. To me, of course, people will think different. People just think that, like, same as the old times of boxing or MMA, the bigger is better type of things, you know. But to me, this match is no less than, like, Levan Saginashvili versus Devon Larat match. And you both know what I'm talking about. People who don't know much about arm wrestling, they don't know. But you know that this is very important because you both, to me, in my book, are...
SPEAKER_00: incredibly high level technicians you know like perfectionists you know i i think that you both are artists arm wrestling artists like like cobra was the same you know so you guys are there are masters there are artists you guys are those people i should say maybe engineer arm wrestling engineer and and i'm i'm glad that you guys are pulling and thank you janice for accepting before you get
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, Yanis. Any older. Yeah, but I'm sure that there will be more times, you know. And do you guys think that if you beat each other, at some point, would you give each other a rematch? Yes, I will give Yanis a rematch, for sure. And I'm pretty sure that in a few years, Yanis will show a completely different shape. Is it stronger? Stronger. And he's going to come and kick your ass? It will be a great rematch, yeah. And he's going to come and kick your ass?
SPEAKER_00: He'll try to, but we will see.
SPEAKER_02: it's always good to hear this i mean this confidence and uh yeah what i like about his uh that very often he is not uh uh talking some uh things uh like like with which we are we used to here like he have very own individual thinking about and some own his own logic about many many things and uh and actually that's that's very like likable and yes working very well
SPEAKER_02: He's trying different stuff. He's trying sometimes some, I don't know, 10, 20 different things. And then he finds one or two or three which are really working for him. I agree. I agree. He's very experienced now compared to before.
SPEAKER_02: I believe when we are so long in a sport, we know that probably like Bob Brown said that he can forget already more than Mendoza has ever known. So the thing is he thinks he knows everything and I believe
SPEAKER_02: Like we all are learning, even you and me after like all those years in the sport, we still are learning, we still are trying to get maybe better, maybe smarter in some other ways. So we will see, we will see. So you are saying that we are still learning and Mindago is done with learning? Like in his mind, in his mind. In his mind, yeah, okay. Everything and what I believe like...
SPEAKER_02: At some point, he has to understand, and he does. When he's losing, he understands that maybe sometimes he still has many things to learn. It's very possible he will learn something new in Texas as well. We will see.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. About that he realized when he loses, I remember that. After I beat him, he was like, can you show me how you are doing that, you know? And he denies it. Next time I talk to him, I will just tell someone to film, you know? And so you remember.
SPEAKER_01: What I'm saying is that I will try to teach him something in Texas as well, so we will see. We will see. That's good, Yanis. That's good. Put him in his place. Another question for Yanis. Another question for Yanis. I'm just thinking now. So, Yanis, let's just think that, okay, maybe there is this scenario where maybe you lose, right? How bad do you think it can be? What's the worst scenario?
SPEAKER_01: scenario for you um you know if you lose how can you how do you imagine it and you know maybe it's a tough war and then you somehow free two and you lose maybe that's the worst in your head or do you think it can go any worse and then i i have been in the sport for almost 30 years and uh we all know that you if you are in the sport long enough
SPEAKER_00: At some point you lose, at some point you lose and it's nothing. You stand up and you go forward. How bad could it be? Do you think it could be a dead move at the end or is it not possible? Yanis, this guy is looking troubled. Same exact thing he told me. I can even show you as a comment on Facebook. He said he was going to fire me and all this.
SPEAKER_00: I hit him so bad. I'm not saying that I'm going to do it. For like two weeks, the bus hit him, bus hit him. So put him in his place. I'm taking sides as an organizer of the East versus West. Taking sides. Let's just say, like, do you think a Kings ball? It will be a good time in the USA and will be fun. And I hope we will enjoy this fight. That's what I believe. Very good attitude.
SPEAKER_01: Because I guess at this point, that's the best we can do, right? Just let's have fun. Let's have a match. We know how it will go. But we should still just smile and enjoy the time. I agree. Yeah, but that's not what your intention was when you were asking the question. Yeah. No, I was just wondering, you know, how bad can it go in Jan's mind? Maybe I can, you know, in a way it would be a challenge for myself to make it worse, man.
SPEAKER_00: Hmm. That, that is not because of that, because you want to do such thing. Yeah. No, that's more, that's more. Yeah. Maybe. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, so we will see. We will see how it will go. We will see. I think I was going to rest after this. It is 11 p.m. here, but I think I will go downstairs and train. Yeah, after I saw this Smartass, I really need to put him in his place. First you do this, and then, yeah. Anyway, so let's talk about some other matches.
SPEAKER_00: It's also over 10 o'clock. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We said, yeah. Okay, just very quickly, John versus Kanayi. Yeah, I promised you for one hour. Sorry about it. But whenever we talk about arm wrestling, I can talk three hours with you guys. Because we all speak the same language and we all know each other from those years of pulling. So I just don't want to talk about anything else. But I think we talk very good. John versus Kanayi.
SPEAKER_02: right now i'm focusing mostly on my fight but uh i i i hope to see uh healthy and a little bit motivated john and then we could see we could see something from this fight but uh can i could be really dangerous and we saw that against hatchings and i'm not sure if john's shoulder will will will be able to hold that i hope i hope because uh
SPEAKER_02: quite sure that john will have some control here if his hand in the center but i i don't know if he will be able to pin can i for uh necessary times maybe maybe a few but i i hope he will but i don't know i don't know minda no so can i is pretty good but i think john knows it so he'll come ready and he does have more center strength i believe so can i will probably go
SPEAKER_00: King's move, and then John just flop, wrist press, like I do with Yanis. Oh, at least he accepted he's going to lose against you. I mean, the wrist. That's good. That's the improvement. Or are you going to do that intentionally? You're going to give your wrist and do it? Well, we will see. We will have fun for sure. We will have fun. Okay, so he couldn't back what he said. Okay, that's good. That's a good reverse shift. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: what is maybe gonna be the match a bit less fun is the fact that I will have another match on the left on the same day right so maybe I cannot play as much as I would like to but um I will do my best I will do my best okay okay and um Dave Chaffee versus uh sweatco
SPEAKER_02: With Georgi, I hope he's back healthy after his injury with leg and then his general health is good. Then it's very hard to take center away from Georgi. He's really dominant in that position, his hand and wrist and everything. And the Chaffee we saw before, he was really struggling and Dave was struggling actually with his hand and wrist.
SPEAKER_02: hopefully they both are back to their more or less best shapes or previous shapes and we will see a great fight because if if so it could be really really great event to see but uh
SPEAKER_00: I kind of go to Georgi's. Can I ask you something? You just said it's hard to take the center from Georgi. You mean to back way, not side way, right? Because side way, yeah. And I see that he could have control here. And if that, then maybe Chaffee can stay with his other hand and wrist. Do you think that Chaffee can keep Georgi's hand flat
SPEAKER_00: and then go at least halfway and then maybe losing there instead of losing right center. Do you think that is a possibility? Because Georgie's side pressure, as far as I know, not that good. Yes, here, this way good, but this way, I think Dave is incredible about just starting from here to at least going halfway.
SPEAKER_02: if if if uh dave is back to his uh previous health then for sure that's a question we don't know because what what we saw from dave lately was not that impressive if he's healthy if he's back to his best then uh he could he could uh win even even maybe something similar likely he did against vitality without a hand and raised but if he's healthy if not
SPEAKER_02: He says he's healthier compared to the last four or five years. Then it could be really fun. But I still think that Gheorghi's ability to take this first center move here is very incredible. It's very good. And there are not too many armistice who can fight with Gheorghi in the center position. And Minde? Right, so I think I'm also a little bit on Gheorghi's side.
SPEAKER_01: But I can see it going both ways. Because again, Chaffee seems to maybe be better right now overall. So yeah, maybe Chaffee will somehow magically take Georgi's wrist. It is possible. He has done that before as well, of course. Yeah, yeah. If that happens, maybe it's difficult for Georgi. But otherwise, I feel like maybe at least in a few rounds, maybe Georgi will...
SPEAKER_00: get his wrist and then chafee cannot really press without his wrist so most likely georgio yeah i understand and and devon versus cody left arm who cares about left come on you used to be the last person to say that yeah the armistice who is struggling with right arm and pulling more with left lately uh
SPEAKER_02: Why you say that? Devon was even better in the past with left arm. That's the thing. Devon right now seems that he's getting better and better with his left as well. And I don't think that you can really clearly top roll or hook Devon with left. But that's the thing. Corey with right arm is pulling this way, like this.
SPEAKER_00: With left arm, he is more pronating and going. So he has very good side pressure. My opinion is that if he can get help way here, and then the rest may be that way. That's the only lane I see, honestly, flash pins. But we don't know about this big Devon. Maybe he will.
SPEAKER_02: That's what I'm thinking the same, that the only way Corey can somehow win against is that he needs a press. Otherwise, I don't think that you can clearly top roll or hook Devon. Then is Corey's press enough? I don't know. I see Devon as a favorite, I see. You, Minde?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think also this big Devon might, you know, normally I would say that Corey has a good chance because those, yeah, that left hand of Corey is pretty good. Like normally he's able to contain people really well. But again, this big Devon might somehow be maybe just... I don't think he will be as big as my opinion as the Tbilisi event. Okay. But yeah, so in any case, I feel like let's say even if Devon
SPEAKER_01: completely dominates and doesn't even feel Corey. I think even then Devon will, my prediction is that even then Devon will still bitch around and complain for 10 minutes before every round. That's my prediction. This guy likes provocation. Even while dominating Devon will still like argue so much with referees and he'll like just complain about everything. That's my prediction. Pretty sure it's going to be like that.
SPEAKER_02: Let's go to Matt Mask versus Ongar Web. That is Hugo. Oh, that's good. That's good. And Ongar Bio likes top rollers. Ongar Bio likes top rollers. He's good with his hand and wrist, but he's very effective against top rollers. We saw him against Irakli. We saw him against...
SPEAKER_02: Even Michael Thorpe was a little bit different, but still. So he's very good and I don't think that he has lost something. The question is only about his shape and how good he is back again after some break enormously.
SPEAKER_02: Ponger Baye was a favorite here. Is Matt Maas having some chances? Of course, it's arm wrestling, but in my understanding, he's underdog.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think that Ongarbayev having an elbow surgery and this is his first comeback match, do you think it would make any difference? That's always a question. We don't know. That's a question. Like how good he is and how ready he is back on the table. Otherwise, I see Ongarbayev as a favorite in this one. And you? I think also Ongarbayev has a really good chance. He might maybe even dominate.
SPEAKER_01: But if he does not dominate, then I can expect something like the match between Ongarbaev and Kurdecha. Remember when Ongarbaev... Yeah, with the dead wrist. But can he do that after such an elbow surgery? Yeah, I'm not sure about that situation, but if he was healthy, that's what I would expect to happen. I don't know. You don't know. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, there are many matches also, but let's finish here. And because I gave my word to even pass that story about it. Because you have to go to do some bicep curls. Me? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I will go there. I will go there. There is no one that motivates me more than Mindago. I don't know why. I know he is rock solid, but whenever he just calmly talks like, you know, quietly and, you know, not like,
SPEAKER_00: roaring but he's just like you know he's like i just like like i want to destroy that guy i think it's normal you know none of us like some kind of new guy coming in and trying to act cool and uh yeah i can imagine i know that feeling i know it yeah me and hunter knows that's how i feel a little bit as well yeah i'm training you you're gonna have another podcast yeah because we have to
SPEAKER_00: Hunter will fire, you know. The guy is just brutal. I'll calm him down a little bit. You will? Yeah. And before we finish, Morozov versus Laletin. What did you guys think about that match? When are we fighting? Is it on the same card or what? No, no, no, no, no. Okay. In Tbilisi, the main event, Morozov and Vitaly Laletin. Where are you from? It just happened. Okay, okay. Come on.
SPEAKER_02: yeah my brain is i guess my brain english and we did a podcast about that and then we said like of course vitaly was favorite but uh we also we also heard that uh all all that stuff with uh devon and morozov and and they won the trolls and that morozov was probably taking it very personally but also it helped for him to keep some motivation in level
SPEAKER_02: he has never probably pushed himself as hard before as well. And that really made a difference. We can never know how it would went. But Morozov not often losing when he's in a fight, when you see that he's winning some rounds. So it's very potential that if not injury,
SPEAKER_00: Morozov could keep his left arm world title, but it was a great fight. It was incredible. It was incredible. And I repeat that all the time, but to stop him and say, like, Davai, Davai, Vitaly, Davai. I was like that. I was watching. From both of them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. And Vitaly put big hearts on the table, you know. You would never believe that.
SPEAKER_00: Morozov to top roll him and Vitaly to press him like this. I don't know what would happen if he didn't get injured round one, round two. Exactly. But we can't take anything from Vitaly's fight. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And you can also see that Vitaly, it seems like he's getting tired, he's kind of breathing hard, and still he's super explosive, fast, effective, and he's still working. So also from side it seems like that he's already tired, but no, he's always still working and still very dangerous.
SPEAKER_00: Incredible. That day I learned new things. I wish I was as good as Mindaugas and still there would be nothing left to learn. But that day I learned that, you know... Welcome. I love this guy. I love this guy. And what did you think about that match, Mindaugas? I also really enjoyed it. Much better than the match before.
SPEAKER_01: So yeah, and I kind of knew that Morozov is, of course, almost a favorite in my mind. Like, yeah, many people just kind of thought that Vitaly was just so much better because Vitaly crushed Morozov on the right. But then you know that Morozov is mainly the left-hand guy. Then I was kind of seeing a good match coming. And yeah, I think Giannis is right. If that injury did not happen, Vitaly did not really look that great.
SPEAKER_00: But I think Vitaly jumping in those deep flop positions, maybe that's what caused the injury, right? No, no, it was early around he got injured and then he made it even worse. You know, when you have that, when you press that, there's even more pressure on the... And also Vitaly is holding on like crazy and then you have to really slip in a weird way. That's also...
SPEAKER_00: It was incredible, yeah. I hope this is a good lesson to people who think that the practice represents the supermatch outcome. And if it was the case, I would give 105 world title to Nugo instead of Devon. But we know that practice, practice, Devon at the competition is a different animal, you know? Yeah. So it's the same for the case, for the opposite way.
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, guys, yeah, you want to say something? I just hope that it's the same for Yanis and Yanis is also a different beast in the competition. Yeah, we can have a good match. Yeah, yeah. I wish you were the same. I wish you were not only a practice champion. Thank you. No, I'm joking, Mindagas. You know how much I respect you. Yeah. Anyways, Yanis, thank you very, very much, my friend. And same to you, Mindagas. I wish you guys
SPEAKER_00: healthy, without any injury. Okay. Well, one question, because this is a super chat, ProWin Astrology, Yanis, does Mindy cheat in the setup?
SPEAKER_02: Armwrestling is a fighting sport and we all try to take some advantage in a setup. You are not probably a good armwrestler if you are not trying to take some better grip or take some advantage. But is there any limit for that? Referees are setting limits.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah so you are saying that if there is problem referee should do it and we shouldn't blame the referees okay i understand yeah anyways once again thank you guys and take care of yourself and again back to the gym a little bit and come on let's we need to see you back on the stage you really want that of course of course listen listen listen okay sorry do you want that because you want to pull me or you really want engine tears on the stage
SPEAKER_00: Like, do you think that you want... No, I only want it because I want to pull you. Of course, I don't really want to see you on the stage fighting against somebody else. Oh, you don't want it. So, you don't think it's a pity if this guy just... I am selfish. No, no more arm wrestling. I am selfish, yes. You are selfish. Okay. Okay. Okay. Take care, guys. Thank you. Let me go and train.
