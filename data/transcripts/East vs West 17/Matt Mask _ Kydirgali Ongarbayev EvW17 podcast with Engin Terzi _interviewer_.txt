SPEAKER_01: Hello, hello everyone. Very soon Ongarbayev and Mask they will join us and we will have also translator from Kazakh language to English language and
SPEAKER_01: I hope you guys will enjoy two different personalities, like two opposite ones, you know. Like, it's more like fire and ice. That is, I mean, how I describe, you know. Matt is fire and Ungarwe are ice. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: uh we have a lot of people waiting here hello hello guys hello hello great to see you guys in chat room um hello turn the phone hello yes just a second is it okay oh yes yeah yeah yeah how are you guys good
SPEAKER_01: Perfect. How about you? Where is Dalet? I'm here, Engin. I'm here. Hey, Dalet. Great to see you, brother. Thank you. My name is Miras. Miras. Nice to meet you, Miras. Yeah. Me too. I'm just trying to share the links on social media so people can be informed that
SPEAKER_01: Hello, my name is Madyar. I will be like a translator. Oh, you will be the translator? Okay, thank you. It's good. It's nice. But I prefer to stay out of video, okay? If it's okay.
SPEAKER_01: Why is that? Just I'm a bit shy. Shy? Yeah. Oh, okay. So we're going to see someone else. Yeah, yeah. We will see someone else, but you will be translated. Okay, maybe when he's talking, you move your mouth. Yeah. Okay, okay. Just joking, joking. So how is everything? Are you guys also arm wrestlers?
SPEAKER_01: Uh, no, no. Okay. No, no, no, no. He's only a little bit. That's good. Okay. And.
SPEAKER_01: let me share this one now and also tag them so how is everything over there cool cool thanks see you that's good it's good yeah this is how's the weather weather yeah
SPEAKER_01: Weather is good. Weather is today surprisingly warm. Someone else came. Oh, Matt is here. Hello, Matt. How's it going, Engin? Good, good, good. Great, great. Great. And we are waiting for Ongar Bayev. I think soon he will join us. So how is everything going, Matt?
SPEAKER_00: good good you you ask you ask for top 10 match you get it when you say top 10 you didn't say eight nine i wanted i initially asked for top five and then i said at least top ten so yeah yeah yeah okay did you check on that by his rank yeah i think he's fifth yeah so good enough yeah yeah okay well and then yeah they'll have to be updated here eventually anyways so
SPEAKER_01: yeah okay we are still waiting so how is your weight right now do you need to lose any weight a little bit uh five six pounds it's nothing huh nothing yeah yeah yeah yeah and like last time we saw you on that big stage you pull against uh marcio barbosa and you you look like
SPEAKER_01: look incredibly dominant and i think the last round you intentionally went inside do i remember correct yeah yeah i just wanted him i think he won the round but still i think it was not that like as easy as people would expect because marcia we know there is originally really strong hoop for sure yeah i wanted to test to see once i had it in the bag i wanted to kind of see
SPEAKER_01: where and and how i felt with him in there so yeah yeah yeah that's that that was surprising when i see your form a lot of people are underestimating you and that's okay let them let them underestimate okay yeah and how do you see your chances i see them good yeah i see them good i want to have accepted the match if i thought he was gonna whoop my ass so
SPEAKER_00: but yeah no i feel yeah i feel confident i feel this is probably the strongest the best shape i've been in years so i'd say probably seven years or longer so so do you do you um how to say do you expect a tough match or you think that you can dominate him
SPEAKER_00: Well, I hope it's an easy match. I'm hoping for an easy match, but I'm expecting it's going to be a complete war. I know Angabayev isn't a one-dimensional puller. He has many, many attributes to his technique where he can transition on the fucking...
SPEAKER_00: flick of a switch, right? So if he feels he's in an uncomfortable position, he can transition smoother and quicker than as quick as anybody in the game, as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, yeah. One second. Hello, Kedirghali. Are you coming? No, no, we have translator. He just needs to join. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, you are, you are joining, you are joining together with him as a translator. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Just, you can join. We already started the podcast. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. We're waiting on you on Dubai. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, guys, I didn't know that he found a translator. I will be ashamed. No problem, no problem. Yeah, I apologize, guys. I apologize. He didn't tell me he found a translator. He said he needed a translator. And I found a translator. Now he says he also found a translator. And, yeah, I just talked with his translator. So I apologize again. Okay, okay. Take care. Take care, guys. Take care, Dara.
SPEAKER_01: Sorry about it. Thank you. Thanks for your time. Yeah, that was interesting. Yeah, wow. I feel bad, but what to do, you know? He didn't tell me he found it, but so it's okay. It's kind of miscommunication, yeah? So you're feeling strong. You are ready for the war. Do you think that stylistically he is okay for you? He doesn't have, unless you're going inside with him, he doesn't have that, like that copy, but he's like more like,
SPEAKER_01: You know, you know, like, so basically he is not really attacking your pronator with the full cup, but he is basically attacking here. And then you will be probably attacking from the other side. You both will be hitting each other. And then do you think that you will be able to have cup over him? Or you think that you better concentrate on full outside move? I'm just gonna, I'm more so gonna do.
SPEAKER_00: with what I feel is my ace right now. And then from there, I'll adjust if I need to. So it's not, I don't really, I'm not really planning on one thing
SPEAKER_00: being able to completely control or dominate him because I know he's going to be coming out of the gates as explosive as he is too, right? So it's more going to be I'm going to be coming in with what I feel is my top ace right now and then if I need to adjust from there to counter where
SPEAKER_01: whatever direction he's going in, I'm sure he's probably coming in with a game plan against me. He's seen lots of my videos as well, too, right? So... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see what is his shape. Some things that he will be better than his last shape. Some things that he will not be better after his surgery. Some says that after the surgery, now he will be healthier. And it has been some long time... What does he say?
SPEAKER_01: I didn't really ask him. I don't care what some people say. I want to know what he says. Soon we will find out. Soon. Very soon. Because he doesn't talk much. Our communication with him is how to say...
SPEAKER_01: um like very like pretty much the very necessary things to set a match understand not not not so much uh conversation yeah and also there is some language barrier and i mean we in fact we both speak the same language but we we like we have been apart from each other for almost a thousand years so we understand each other if you spend some time together but yeah so he just doesn't like talking to you
SPEAKER_01: no i don't think so i'm just joking no no no i mean he doesn't really talk a lot you know like i mean he's just different type of guy you and him totally two different uh people salam alaikum um
SPEAKER_01: Can you, like, we were talking with Matt and Matt, Matt, uh, and I, we were talking and I said on Garvey, I've had an elbow surgery and some people think that he's better than last time we saw him. And some people think that he is not as good as last time because of the surgery. Some says because of the surgery now he's healthier. And some says that it is his first comeback match after the surgery.
SPEAKER_02: And so we would like to ask Kedirgali, how does he feel compared to last time we saw him?
SPEAKER_02: I have pressed a lot of time and I'm now I spent my operation in my head and and now
SPEAKER_01: I'm ready to 100%. You are ready 100%. That's good. I think that's what Matt would like to hear. Matt wouldn't like to pull someone who is not at his best yet. And can we ask him? As far as I know, he said elbow surgery. They removed a piece of bone. He sent me the photo of it. Did I understand him correct? Was it from his elbow or was it from his wrist?
SPEAKER_01: um yeah yeah yeah so he he feels he feels
SPEAKER_01: much better he was bothering him probably right uh when he trained in the company he usually doesn't talk about these kind of things but i asked to matt so uh let me ask him as well how does he see his chances does he expect a top match
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, OK. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And he's ready now because almost already he's trained for more kilograms and he's built it for himself and he's sure to win in this championship. He's sure of himself to win? Yeah, yeah. Okay. And can you turn your phone sideways? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yeah. So that's good. That's good. He's confident, Matt. War is waiting for both of you guys. Okay. Hello, Matt. Yeah. I will see now. I'm just seeing. Any comments, Matt? Nothing? You are surprisingly quiet. I think it's because the opponent is so respectful, so you cannot get fired up.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well, I'll get fired up when they call my name to the table, right? So yeah, yeah, it's no sense, no sense wasting it now. So I'll just build it, let it build up, right? So yeah, yeah, yeah. So no, I'm looking, I'm looking forward to it. He's somebody, somebody I respect.
SPEAKER_00: a boatload in the sport and he's somebody i've always wanted to test myself against so yeah he's he's definitely a well-feared arm wrestler throughout the sport so it's uh yeah i'm i'm excited i'm nervous as hell but i pull way better when i'm nervous so i'm looking forward to it yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's how it is usually, yeah. And this is probably one of your most important matches in your career, one of them at least? I think so. I think, yeah, right now it's my most important one to date because this is going to put me in a spot, closer to a spot to what I'm going for and where I want to be. When we talk, you said eventually you want to win the title.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going for the title. Yeah, and you know who is holding the title right now. What's that? When you translate, can you mute the microphone? Anyway, so do you know who is holding the title right now? Yeah, Devin currently has the title. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you express your goals to him as well?
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, he knows. He told me, he said, he's like, oh, I'll just, I'll hand the belt, I'll give it back. And I says, no, no, motherfucker. I says, that's not what's going to happen. I says, you're going to fast, do all the shit you got to do, take care of what you need to take care of in the super heavyweights, and you're fastening your ass back down 105, and me and you are going to have a rematch again, right? Uh-huh.
SPEAKER_00: so no no matter how close you guys are as brothers it doesn't mean that the competition at the table ended no it never matters when it comes to like as soon as before the competition yeah a little bit we're still brothers after the competition we're back right back to full-fledged brothers while the competition is taking place i hate him right oh okay yeah yeah you don't want him to tell you one more year right
SPEAKER_01: no no no of course not nobody wants to hear that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i understand yeah anyway so have you been following the events that at the east versus west have you watched the events closely since you were
SPEAKER_01: Matt has a goal to become number one at 105 and what is his like Matt of course he believes he's gonna win and and Matt first let me ask you if you win this like I mean do you have anything like you want to go title you you need one more match how do you think that yourself you know
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. Whatever the fuck you guys want to give me. If I need to beat four more people to get to the title match, then that's what I'll do. If you guys want to give me a title match, then I'll be ready for a title match. It doesn't matter to me. I will be a little bit provocative. Kader Ghali, Matt wants to have a title shot eventually. What is his chance to get the goal?
SPEAKER_04: he's gonna say no problem right because he says he's gonna she's sure that he's gonna be okay
SPEAKER_02: and really said that it's my first match after resting and I feel so good and now I'm trying to reach, take this title in this to one and five hundred kilogram.
SPEAKER_01: His goal is now this. Okay. And another question. I think he lost his last two matches, right? He lost against Tata Kings and he lost against Petrenko. Does he think, does he feel, it's not as an excuse, but does he feel that his injury that caused him to have surgery,
SPEAKER_02: Did it, like, play an important role? Like, does he think that in the shape that he is now, he can have chances against those guys?
SPEAKER_04: yes okay uh in in this uh too much uh i have a handage and i
SPEAKER_02: I made a operation for my head and I feel my head now 400% and I'm ready now. I'm also desire to win in this match. Okay. Yeah. He has desire to win this match. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. I understand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And Matt, what's your favorite match in this card other than your own match? There's a lot of good ones. I'm interested to see how Devin's left does with Corey. What is your expectation?
SPEAKER_00: uh what's your expectation i expect corey coming out of the gates hot and powerful and probably taking the first round maybe two and then i've i see devin finding a hole from there slowing them down a little bit and then just bleeding them out from there so so you don't expect a full domination by devin right from the start uh not so much with this left yet
SPEAKER_00: I haven't really seen his left do a whole lot in competition against some fierce, fierce, fierce competitors. Yeah, because a lot of people are thinking that this isn't like walking in the park. I'll tell you, last week it felt absolutely retarded. His left felt insane. My left is...
SPEAKER_00: completely in the trash can right now for at least a month or so just to recoup it's usually only good for one match every couple months anyways and then I'm just pretty much recovery game for the next two months so but uh his left his left feels absolutely ridiculous right now so but you expect a competitive match in the early rounds I think so yeah the like for how explosive core he is and how much power he has initially when he first steps up to the table
SPEAKER_00: But as soon as he starts breathing a little heavier and he's getting some blood into them arms is where he starts to taper down, right? So you are saying that the usual scenario for most of Devon's matches? Yeah. Not maybe most, but a lot of his matches. I would say it's going to be more similar for what his matches used to be for his left compared to his right. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Todd and Oleg's love child says, Engin Terzi is the greatest promoter and has the greatest, strongest pronator. I don't know what that was. Yeah. And how do you see Devon versus Corey? Can I repeat, please? Devon versus Corey, left arm. Soul call, soul call. Devon. Devon is the winner? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Does he think easy or hard match? He speaks in German. 18 for 20% slices. What's that? 18 and 20% slices. Okay, 80% Devon, 20% Korey. Okay. Okay, I understand. How is your left arm doing, Ongar Bey?
SPEAKER_01: I'm asking his focal, how is it? I started training for my right hand and right now I am started. Oh, he started training his left arm? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay, I understand, yeah. And another match, let's talk.
SPEAKER_00: Another one I'm super pumped about too is John Terrien and Craig Tullier. Yeah, okay. How is it going, Matt? I'm honestly on the fence on that one. You know, it'd be awesome to see John pull off another victory. John's been on an absolute tear lately. He's probably one of the most, if not the most active arm wrestler out there right now at that top level. Craig is just an awesome, awesome dude. Then, you know,
SPEAKER_00: the top in that weight division for many, many, many years. So it'd be nice to, you know, maybe see him pass it on to John.
SPEAKER_00: but i also also hate to see craig lose as well right so it'll be interesting to see see where those two stand against each other so i'm i'm honestly completely on the fence on that one yeah i'm 50 50 on that for sure and it could you do you expect craig to be offensive in john's chance to uh like
SPEAKER_01: John's chance is like after he stops Craig or do you think do you think that there is a possibility John to win this match right from the I don't see John winning it right out of the gates in the early rounds
SPEAKER_00: I can only see, I see it more him slowing, slowing Craig down, slowly working back, bleeding Craig a little bit, getting him into shitty positions. But just him finding that speed spot where he can slow Craig down, because Craig is so explosive, just driving right inside and then he's on top of your arm. And then even from those positions, he'll smack, smack, smack, smack, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He can continue to do that. Yes, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_01: and i'm gonna ask you on that way with different match probably he is not so much familiar with a lot of uh north american athletes but um i want to ask him about dave chefy versus um georgie swedco to kidder uh
SPEAKER_02: I can't comment that which people will win. I think it's 50-50%. Because a lot of time had a rest and now we can't check and
SPEAKER_02: can give a comment because uh they had a lot of rest uh and they need a fight fight uh last times okay so he doesn't have any idea who's gonna win yes okay okay and how do you see this in future i think okay and matt how do you see this match this is one of my favorite matches in the car that's yeah that's another one um
SPEAKER_00: completely on the fence about too. It's going to be super, super exciting to watch. So like Dave, Dave is just a freak. If Dave shows up good, uh, if Dave shows up good, then Dave is amongst some of the best, the strongest that's ever come out of North America. I believe even the world in arm wrestling, uh,
SPEAKER_00: like georgie phenomenal phenomenal top role but we haven't really seen him do much else besides that uh so i think it's more i think it's more going to be based on how dave is feeling right now i don't know 100 how he's feeling if his neck is slightly tweaked or injured or still causing us he feels better better much better he's 100 now
SPEAKER_01: I don't know about 100%, but he said that he was feeling good during the Atlantic City event. That's what we all say. We all say that. He said that he is now able to do a lot of exercises that he hasn't been able to do for some years. He says right now he can do many things that he wasn't able to do. I think Georgie may be in a lot of trouble. And
SPEAKER_00: And I hate it when you put matches like this together because I love both of these guys through and through. Both of them are probably the nicest two dudes you'll ever meet in your life. Yes, I agree. So, to have, like, it's hard to pick a favourite, right? So, and...
SPEAKER_00: Based off of what you just told me, I think my last prediction, I have a prediction coming out where I'm going to be saying Georgie is possibly going to have the upper hand. But based off what you're saying, then I think maybe we're going to see Dave with the upper hand. So Dave's hand and wrist is, when everything's connected, is absolutely insane. I expect very close match. If Dave was not feeling good,
SPEAKER_00: then I would say Yogi's favorite. I would say inside of me, I wouldn't say outside. But since I see that now he's in good shape, so I see... Especially too, Dave now has a good roll over with his shoulder, able to get into a press. So if he can stop Georgie's top roll at all in any way and get him even close to the pad, he can still roll on top of his arm, right? If he didn't have the shoulder pressure with deadlifts,
SPEAKER_01: I would still say that Giorgi would be probably favourite, but whenever now he has that one, even if his wrist fails very near to the pad, he'll just keep driving. He just ain't going to stop. I was shocked when he first tried it against Vitaly, and then whenever later he did against Frank Lamparelli in Orlando, he was there as well, and so we know that he has some strong
SPEAKER_01: Pressure, yeah. Yeah, anyway, so let's go to, we were going to say Jerry versus Kamil, but probably you heard that Jerry lost his father and he didn't feel good. He doesn't want, you know, like really, so we cancelled that match, you know. Who was he supposed to follow?
SPEAKER_00: Kamil Jablonski, both. It would be a very interesting match. Who do you think would win that one? I would say Jerry. I would say there's nobody out there that has a better press than Jerry. When it comes to power-to-power, press-to-press, I'd definitely have to pick Jerry on that one. Until Kamil proves us otherwise.
SPEAKER_01: Do you remember Cody Merritt? Cody Merritt, yes. And what do you think about Cody Merritt versus Evgeny Prudnik left arm? Evgeny Prudnik and Evgeny Prudnik. Evgeny Prudnik and Evgeny Prudnik.
SPEAKER_01: super i wait super super i wait yeah cody married you have seen at the east first place before he what would he make in 115 anytime soon that's for sure oh yeah for sure yeah no cody cody would not be making one cody would need to lose an uncle of kurt or golly to make 150. cody cody cody is
SPEAKER_02: I really think Cody will win. Cody will beat Brutnik? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He can win. He has the technique to win. Say again? He has the technique to win. Okay, okay. And how do you see this, Matt? I want to see Cody to win.
SPEAKER_00: I'd really love to see Cody win. I'm just not sure if Cody is going to be able to keep up with the wizardry of Gevney and the setup and everything. With his short little thumb, the way he knows how to utilize it, be able to get what he wants. I think Cody's going to come out of the gates hot the first one or two matches. But I think...
SPEAKER_00: Prudnik's messing around and his ability to be able to get a little more of what he wants and be able to find a sweet hole on him. And his left is looking pretty phenomenal lately. I think Prudnik's probably going to come back and take this one. So I'm cheering for Cody, but my honest opinion, I think Prudnik may end up taking it. How do you see with the left arm Prudnik beating him? He needs to hook him or...?
SPEAKER_00: yeah i see him yeah i see him wearing his arm down a bit just getting enough grip and cup around him where cody cody is coming down on him a lot more and not able to get the pronation that he needs to just because of the way prudnik's thumb is designed it causes you to wanna need to come down more in order to in order to see his thumb knuckle so so i think i think prudnik's gonna end up getting enough bite on him round number three so
SPEAKER_00: Okay, okay, I understand. Yeah. And... And Prudnik does have, if he can get enough bite, you get him close down to that pin line, he has a phenomenal, phenomenal hold and lock really close to that pin line, right? So... And Cody... Cody doesn't really have much of a huge transition into a press when he's fully extended underneath the table doing his top roll, right? So...
SPEAKER_00: for him to be down here and kind of drive back up in order about to finish him. I don't know if he'll be able to pull it off. So, so I'm thinking slight edge towards Evgeny. Okay. Kedrigali, Mindaugas, Tarasaitis, Giannis, Amolins. I shouldn't do this. Yeah, Mindaugas, Tarasaitis, Giannis, Amolins.
SPEAKER_01: What's that? Can you translate? In my opinion, it will be . I understand. I understand. And another thing I want to ask you, his answers are very short.
SPEAKER_02: When you say that you are 100%, you are saying you are 100% healthy or also the weights that you lift are at your best? Also health and also weight which they lift.
SPEAKER_01: okay so he is totally healthy and he is lifting the weights that he always was able to lift when he was at his best okay yeah all levels okay sarah beckman versus jocelyn another another uh homegirl i should say maybe i don't know from canada yeah how do you see this match
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to have to give the edge to Sarah Backman on this one. Just the amount of time. What's that? Why is it? Because last time Jocelyn won and Jocelyn is new and has been training for one year or 10 months since last time they pulled. Jocelyn ended up beating Sarah. How long ago was that? 10 months ago. I think 10 and a half months ago.
SPEAKER_01: I don't even remember that. Yeah, yeah. I never realized they actually pull. Yeah, they should. I think they pull, if I'm not mistaken, they pull round robin.
SPEAKER_01: And they pulled only once, and Sarah, I think, went inside, and Jocelyn was so good. Was Sarah still suffering? I know she was suffering with some shoulder injuries for a while there, too. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think that she had an excuse for that one, but since it was round robin, she didn't have any opportunity to try something different. It was only one match. And they said that I think after the event they pulled, and then Sarah Beckman, I think,
SPEAKER_01: this time didn't go in, went out and beat Jocelyn. And Jocelyn says that she has been training her hand very good and she thinks that she can counter that.
SPEAKER_00: don't know yeah i'm i've i gotta give the upper hand to sarah just with the amount of experience that she has on that main stage with like how many times she's been to the top she is one of the strongest most well-rounded arm wrestlers that there is in the woman category that's been around right like she she isn't right now but she's still definitely one of the best so i'm i still gonna have to give sarah
SPEAKER_01: sarah the upper hand on this one i think we might see jocelyn come in and sneak one in on her but i have a feeling sarah is going to take this 3-1 so okay and what do you think about the mindagas versus canis can you say that two of the best top rollers are competing against each other
SPEAKER_01: I say I've got to give this one to Giannis. If Giannis is 100% healthy, like I know he tweaked himself the last time in Florida, I think it was, at King of the Table. No, East versus West it was. It was East versus West, yeah, in Florida. About eight months before the event. Like from the event day to go back is about, I think, eight months, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So like he slightly tweaked himself since then. Giannis isn't going to be jumping on the table unless he feels a hundred percent, unless he's already on the table and he's injured, he's going to follow through, but I can't see him jumping on unless he feels a hundred percent plus Giannis. Giannis isn't just a phenomenal, isn't just a phenomenal top roller. He's phenomenal everywhere on the table. And I believe in that weight category, he does have one of the best stamina's out of everybody, like the amount of,
SPEAKER_00: incredible shape that he's in right so i i'm gonna definitely i'm picking yannis on this one i think we're gonna see ming douglas is gonna come in get all cocky arrogant but i think uh at least for a round maybe two if he's lucky but i think yannis is going to take this one yeah i'm saying yannis three i was just talking about doing that mode to yannis
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, see, he's already getting cocky about it, right? If you ask Mindaugas, he's going to tell you that nobody stands a chance, you don't stand a chance, nobody stands a chance against him, right? Time will show, time will show. But we're not asking Mindaugas, right? You can't pass him on his confidence because you know he's got it, right? Most of the times he backs his words, but sometimes not.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you know, you know, you know, there's a lot of people out there that want to see him get humble eyes with the amount of times that he has trash talked and he has become successful with it. But I, I think Yanis is going to take this. So even though he did hold that belt for a long time. Again, I'm going to ask you because I'm not sure if Kedirgali is familiar with these guys and Cody versus Joseph.
SPEAKER_00: You remember Joseph, he was at the King of the table. Joseph, Joseph phenomenal. Like he did an amazing, amazing job. Uh, Cody, I don't know a whole lot about Cody, but based off of, I think Cody's more of a top roller. If I'm, if I'm, if I'm not mistaken, um,
SPEAKER_00: I would say, yeah, that I think Joseph is going to get the stop on him, sink him inside, get that stop. And it's going to be Joseph from there. And mainly because I don't know much about Cody. And Joseph's last performance at King of the Table was absolutely insane. Yeah. And Hunter versus Valen. Do you know who Valen Lowe is from Singapore?
SPEAKER_00: Hunter Noss. I know Hunter. Hunter is a bad dude. I don't really know his opponent that well. So I can't really make a true judgment off that. But based off of Hunter Noss and how many of us see and hope that he's going to be the new
SPEAKER_00: super lightweight from north america coming in and kind of making a wave and he's versus west as a savior for our lightweight divisions um i gotta go with hunter on this one so okay because we want to see him just continuing to progress right yeah the guy is like like you almost yeah that the fire you know so oh he gets he gets rev right up right yeah yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: Not like you. Nobody can be like you. But if we have a close second, maybe he's a candidate there. And, yeah. Kidirgali, were you surprised when you saw Kanayi stop Tata Sings and gave him an incredible match? Were you surprised? Kanayi? Kanayi? Yeah, Kanayi, when he gave a good match to Tata Sings.
SPEAKER_01: was it was was uh surprise to see are you an arm wrestler you translate but you are you an arm wrestler no no i'm nervous i'm not i am wrestler and i'm not uh you don't know these names right you don't know these names yeah yeah yeah you don't know okay um can you ask him
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, I can ask. It's definitely a good name, which surprised Kedar Gali, yeah? Yeah, yeah. There was two athletes. One name is Tata Shinks. Other one is from Japan, Yoshinobu Kanai. They had a very tough match. Was Ongarbe surprised to see Kanai giving such a tough match to Tata Shinks? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Brazil vs Canada. Canada is the last match. Kidirkali. Kidirkali. East vs West 15.
SPEAKER_01: Kanayi and Tata Sings, long match. Did you have a surprise? Yes, yes. Did you have a surprise? I did. Kanayi is strong? Strong? Strong. Strong, yeah. Do you want to try with Kanayi sometime? Like... Sometimes. I'll try. I'll try. I'll try. I'll try.
SPEAKER_02: In training, we rest one hour and one half hour. We train one and a half hour? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We can rest one hour.
SPEAKER_01: no no no no no no you you're talking about you're talking about arlington no i said in another event at some point he wants to pull again yeah yeah i'm telling about uh can i uh uh in training uh bracelet uh with scanning one hour and uh one and point half hour i don't know did you understand matt what he's saying not much he'll tell you in an hour
SPEAKER_01: No, I don't think he would say something like that. Yeah, anyways, anyways. So, okay. Let's continue. We have Yoshinobi, Kanai, John Brzezink. Who is the winner? Kanai is John Brzezink. Thank you very much. John Brzezink is the champion of the 5-0 league. John Brzezink is the champion.
SPEAKER_01: from president it's a legend and he's a lot of experience and i think uh he will win okay he thinks that he's gonna win okay yeah okay that's and how do you see this match matt i want to see john win i know john has the tools to win
SPEAKER_00: Whether or not John has enough in his tank anymore to do it three times, I'm not 100% sure on that. Yoshi's, King's move is enough to tire the majority of the people out. And John's starting to get a lot more tired than he used to be in rounds. So I...
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to have to go with Yoshi on this one, but I'm really cheering for John. I think John, John has the perfect ability, the way he can low hand top roll, get a guy turned upside down and still transition to the press and stay on top of it. I think if John
SPEAKER_00: has been working on that and he does it flawlessly throughout. John can probably take this 3-0, but seeing how much he was able to hold up Hutchins throughout, I don't know if John's going to have enough in the tank to quite get around it. Okay, a question that I asked other people I want to ask you too.
SPEAKER_01: like pata chings couldn't finish kanai because he wanted to go his classic way yeah that's that's the shoulder pressure he doesn't have like when you're open like this you know usually you need that one and that's not doesn't have that ability but john has it so john does yes yeah john so you are saying that uh as of now with what you know kanai looks favorites but
SPEAKER_00: Would you be surprised if John just... No, I wouldn't be surprised if John does. I'm just a little bit worried about John being able to pull it off quick enough before he starts to run out of gas.
SPEAKER_00: just because John, I think John's stamina is starting to, as stylistically, John has all the tools to be able to make it happen, his ability to come over and his ability to drive into that press when somebody's upside down like that, flawlessly is like nobody else. But if he gets into a position where it's slightly, a little too sticky and Yoshi's really driving back when he goes to drive in and John feels like he's separating him from the shoulder and can't get the connection he needs,
SPEAKER_00: and has to try to work for it a bunch of times, I think we're going to see it switch over to Yoshi. So I'm cheering for John, and I hope he can just come in, boom, boom, teach us all a lesson, show us another thing that, you know, that...
SPEAKER_01: seems so simple to him but a lot of us have issues to build to do it i'd love to see it but i'm just not sure right now okay and there is another match in your category and two guys that live in u.s but originally one is from russia the other one is from armenia arsene cachetarian versus andrei sharkovich
SPEAKER_01: Do you know these guys well enough? I know Andrei Shurkovich. I don't know Arsene very well. But you have heard of him? Yeah, since the match was announced. Oh, really? Wow. Yeah. He has done some good things over here before he went to the US. Okay, the last one we have Hunter versus Mindaugas left arm. Hunter says that
SPEAKER_01: He is originally left-handed and he feels very confident. And then the other day we had a podcast with Hunter and his right-arm opponent, Valen Lowe. And then he mentioned that, I said, would you pull Mindaugas if I would set a match between you guys? He said, yeah. And I just called Mindaugas during the live. He accepted and we set the match. So both of them have two matches then?
SPEAKER_01: yes yeah they are going to pull the right arm matches first and then in the left arm matches because the right arm matches are the ones that we originally set uh so then they can do whatever they can uh with the other hands yeah has has mindaugas competed recently with his left i mean he won 2023 waffles in 154 70 kilo okay and and he
SPEAKER_01: Do you remember the guy, the Kazakh guy who won 154, 70 kilo East vs. West world title, Danil Ustinov? He had a very long match with an Armenian guy at the East vs. West 15 in Istanbul. And yeah, Minda was beat that guy and he won the title.
SPEAKER_01: world title waffle title and yeah i mean that was left arm like seven years ago eight years ago he has wins against daniel prokopchuk as well with left arm but as far as i remember since that time daniel didn't lose against him maybe last time he lost and he lost against him was maybe 2016. yeah i think i think ming doug is matched with yannis
SPEAKER_00: is going to be a lot tougher than Hunter Noss' match that he has. So I think Mingdaugas is possibly going to come into this a little more gassed.
SPEAKER_00: than Hunter is. I haven't really seen Hunter's left compete too much. I remember hearing about it. I know his right is phenomenal. If it's anything like his right, then yeah, I'm going to go with Hunter Noss. I'm on the Hunter Noss train. So let's go with Hunter Noss with two Ws at this one.
SPEAKER_01: um what did you think about ermes versus ermes versus michael match i'm asking this and i will ask you another question about uh michael what did he think about the match between ermes and michael yes
SPEAKER_01: I saw this match and Ermes... Yeah, yeah, he won. Does Kedirgale think that the way that Ermes pulled against Michael was the same as Kedirgale pulled against Michael? I didn't understand. You didn't understand? With Michael. Kedirgale... Again, if they will fight, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: No, no. Khedr Ghali and Michael in the past, they competed. And now Michael recently competed against Ermes. Does Khedr Ghali think that his style and Ermes' style was the same against Michael? Did you understand or no? Ermes and Michael are the same.
SPEAKER_04: No, I miss it. He's probably I think it's best. Now, and this is best in the technique is this? Yeah, nowadays. Okay. And now in May, next event,
SPEAKER_01: Most likely, Michael is going to pull Vitaly Laletin. What does he think? Who's going to win? Vitaly or Michael? Vitaly win. Vitaly win? Yes. But ask him, what if Michael stops Vitaly?
SPEAKER_01: I know. Vitaly is a long hand. But what if Michael stops him? Does he think that Vitaly can find a way to win?
SPEAKER_01: Like I said, he can, he knows his technique, which win to him. So he thinks that Vitaly can win like this? Yeah. So, Federicali, do you think that Vitaly can do this as strong as Ermes can do?
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah if he will stop uh he can uh use this technique oh okay and are you there matt uh can you repeat please no i'm asking if matt is there ah okay
SPEAKER_01: anyway so okay no problem no problem matt um do you think that do you think that um lalatin has the tools
SPEAKER_01: Did you think it was a hard match? Or it was not a hard match? Do you think that if Ermes would make any mistake, it would be problematic for him?
SPEAKER_00: I don't think it was easy for Hermes. If it was really easy for Hermes, you would have seen it over a lot quicker. So I don't think Hermes is the type of person that wants to hang on to somebody for as long as he did. So especially with the size of him now, he's probably trying to get it over as quick as possible.
SPEAKER_00: But, yeah, I think Vitaly does have the tools. Vitaly has the levers. Vitaly has the pronation to be able to get Mike turned upside down in that bottle position. Whether or not Vitaly has the tools to be able to roll on top of it, because if you notice the way Ermi's top rolls and the way Vitaly top rolls,
SPEAKER_00: It's slightly different. Ermias I find is a lot more tighter with his arm the whole way. If Vitaly gets stopped at all, Vitaly's a little more extended and a little more underneath the table.
SPEAKER_00: So whether or not he's able to come back up from that position and roll into the press, come out, roll into a press the way that Hermes is able to do it, like flawlessly back and forth from top roll to a press, top roll to a press, I don't know if Vitaly can, because I don't think I've ever seen him transition like that back and forth from the top roll to the press. What is the possibility of him to flash pin, Michael?
SPEAKER_00: Well, anything's possible, but it's not easy. If Vitaly has any stamina issues, which didn't look like he had when he pulled Artem, because Artem, in my eyes, is one of the best for stamina in that super heavyweight division. But if he can do it quickly, yeah. But if he does stop and he struggles too much, I can see it turning into Mike Spader.
SPEAKER_01: So I think Vitaly has the tools to do it. Whether or not he can transition through him the way he needs to, I'm not sure. A lot of people are underestimating Michael. They don't realize how difficult it can become once you can beat him right away.
SPEAKER_00: and well if you don't if you don't defend mike right away and the way he's like he's he's coming back he's attacking the out of your pronator too right yeah when the way that he's driving so the closer you get to that pin line the more your wrist is wanting to get driven back because he's really stretching it out right so
SPEAKER_00: so it's not like people oh it's easy it's easy no it ain't easy like it no ask on the bio how easy it was and i guarantee you it wasn't easy for no it was not it was it was you needed to get enough over okay no i'm not there yet get a little more okay i'm not there yet
SPEAKER_00: When you think you have enough, you need three times more than what you actually had in order to be able to finish. It is not all about the power. You need to be very strong. Also, you need to have all kind of tools. Well, you need to know when to go for that pin with Michael. I think you can hold him up, get what you need, kind of get close to the pad, feel your wrist start to go okay, and as opposed to committing too much to that pin, come up and grab a bit more, grab a bit more, then try the pin. No, not yet.
SPEAKER_01: grab a bit more grab a bit more and then you can fully commit but if you fully commit to pinning them before you have fully enough i think you're screwing yourself yeah we will see we will see because this match is very important because this this is also another like we found an opponent for levan which is hermes after beating michael
SPEAKER_01: And now this one, I think if Michael wins, he wants to go for Levan at the end of the year. While if Laletin wins, he's also ready to pull Devon. And when are they supposed to be pulling? Hermes and Levan? Yeah. Or Michael and Vitaly. Michael and Vitaly, they are going to pull in May.
SPEAKER_01: May 10th. Another question for you Matt. If you win this match, are you open to pull against anyone from top 10 or you are only considering to pull against someone who is ranked above you?
SPEAKER_01: I don't really care. I don't really care. As long as I get that shot here eventually. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. As long as you are able to win, then of course you are going to, yeah. And okay, Khedr Ghali.
SPEAKER_01: uh you don't you don't like to talk so much and i understand it and i respect and is there anything you would like to add you would like to say anything to the fans to your opponents matt okay i'm also uh
