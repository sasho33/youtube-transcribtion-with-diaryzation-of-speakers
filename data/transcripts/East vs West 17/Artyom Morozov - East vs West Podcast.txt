SPEAKER_04: Oh, hi. Hello, hello, hello. How are you, Alex? Pretty good, but still sick. You? Oh. How are you? You got ill during the event, or what? Yeah, from the press conference, I think.
SPEAKER_04: i will tell you i will tell you a story about a young guy that you know thinks that he's so tough and walks in winter time with t-shirts outside you want to hear about this because of that it's not because of that because even on press conference i was in my coat because it was pretty cold but the thing is man everyone i know got sick one one of us has lagging internet i don't know which one of us yeah i noticed too um just a second
SPEAKER_04: you think it's me it looks good now no i mean yeah now good but a while ago either you or i okay so how is everything you said you are ill huh
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but it's okay. I'm going back slowly. I really want to train, but I have to wait a bit, you know. Is that you? You're training? I mean, I decided to get ready. Yeah. For August 7th, I plan. I say this because if I don't have...
SPEAKER_02: Any goal, I can't really motivate myself. Yeah, yeah. See, you're frozen. One of us is frozen, for sure. Now it's all good. Red. Hello, Engin. Здорово. Okay, to me, Morozov looks fine. Hello. Hello. Okay, Shandy must be. Я зависаю, например, у тебя сейчас.
SPEAKER_04: No, I don't know. Okay, who has the internet problem? Guys who are watching us, tell us. Because sometimes Alex is getting frozen. How are you, Artur? Good to see you. I'm good, thank you. How are you? Yeah, I think he must be on my internet. Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
SPEAKER_00: So, how is the arm, Artyom? How is the arm? Well, it's good, in principle. There is no swelling anymore. It doesn't hurt, doesn't bother, moves. But they said not to move, just to make it grow.
SPEAKER_02: You know, the swelling is gone and I don't really have much pain anymore, but still I don't move it because they said you have to, you have to wait for it. You have, you can't move it around. So it grows back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Again, sometimes I like you get cut. I don't know from my side, Alex, when you're translating, but I don't know what's wrong. Maybe my internet.
SPEAKER_04: Anyway, so... Artem! Come on, Vitaly! Come on! Come on! It was incredible. It was incredible, yeah. At that moment, everything was already crunching. I was holding that bow.
SPEAKER_04: at that moment he said already it was cracking and i was holding only with my uh back pressure yeah yeah yeah guys sorry one more time i'm asking to the people who are watching us so everything looks good because like i feel a little bit cut you know like legging just let me ask them
SPEAKER_04: Okay. Artyom, whenever you stopped Vitaly here, and like Vitaly was trying to go, you were holding him, and you were just saying, Davai Vitaly. That was, how to say, a reaction to the pressure that you had been like having
SPEAKER_04: by the community that people said that you had no chance and he was gonna crush you and now you stop him and then that was not only to vitality probably it was to to everyone right that that reaction because you train for that moment yeah just to just to just to like how to say i shouldn't say honor but you like to like you were probably happy that like
SPEAKER_02: It didn't go as people were thinking. When you stopped him at that moment, did you understand the reaction? That it was not only Vitaly, but all those people who said that it would pass quickly. This feeling of joy, it was for them too, that you shouted, come on, Vitaly, when you held him, when you showed everyone that it would not be like everyone said, everyone thought that the matches would be quick.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, that's the way it is. I don't have anything personal with Vitaly, we're friends anyway. And we were friends before that, we were just talking. It just pressed me, this whole situation with the comments. And I wanted to... Well, I proved it to myself. But the plan was, of course, different. I didn't expect my hand to crunch and fall there, but...
SPEAKER_00: It was even more pleasant that she was in pain, and the adrenaline from the pain. The fact that I was holding her, despite the fact that she was in pain, gave me a boost.
SPEAKER_02: You know, yeah, obviously it was that I was happy and it was to prove to myself as well, because obviously I had a different plan. I didn't want to go all the way down. The plan was to hold tighter. But the moment when I felt it, you know, not snapping, but the pain and when it went down, it felt even better. All the adrenaline, all the pain, and I was still holding it. It felt very good as well.
SPEAKER_04: It made me even more motivated. Yeah, it was for me one of the most unforgettable moments in the arm wrestling history. Vitaly to go here and then Morozov to stop him like this much, like maybe three centimeters from the pad.
SPEAKER_04: and then he him to like scream like you know it was just like i will never forget that moment it is like some part of my head i will never forget it was incredible yeah and tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow vitality will be my guest i will also talk with him and it was it was like both of them are
SPEAKER_04: Incredible warriors. Artem, huge respect for you, my friend. Huge respect. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I am sure that it was more than gauntlet, more than belt, more than title. It was like, I think, more for your own honor, you know, you fought there.
SPEAKER_02: It wasn't just about the gloves and the belt. It was for you. It was like pride. You know, I can do it. I'll win. He said it was one of the most unforgettable matches for me. Because it was imprinted in my head. I'll never forget how you stopped him over the pillow. Three centimeters. And you're shouting, come on, Vitaly, come on. Thank you very much. I did my best. Now he'll get better and we'll continue to fight.
SPEAKER_04: No, thank you very much. I was trying. And definitely when it heals up, I'll come back and we'll continue on firing. Everyone who puts his heart into it, as much as Artem Morozov did, will for sure be supported by me.
SPEAKER_04: all the time you know that that guy deserves utmost respect yeah anyway so how is the arm right now like how is it like what is the process you know about healing okay
SPEAKER_00: said in general that there was a completely torn off the tendons of this bone together with the shelf, the bones were torn off, of course, well, of course, the picture was taken, but the one who did the picture, he said it, of course, I went to the doctor, they said that you have partially torn off the tendons, but the bones are still intact because they still made a CT for tomography with a computer and well, they said just not to move and
SPEAKER_00: because it says to do the operation it is exactly the same as if you are now just in peace you will leave and she will rest and she herself will start and now on the days I took off the gypsum look like nothing and decided to just walk well, I didn't do anything with my hand, the dog ran up with a toy, I took it by habit with my left hand and threw it like this,
SPEAKER_00: My arm just clicked. It didn't hurt, it just clicked. And I was just wrapped in bandage, elastic. And I unwind the bandage, look, something swollen again. I went to do MRT again. Well, I went to do MRT again. It was three days ago.
SPEAKER_00: I did an MRI, yesterday they sent me the result, and it seems that there is nothing, it seems to heal, that everything is fine, as if. Well, my hand, it continued to move, as it were, it bent, it bent, the fingers, everything works. Well, now, in general, it's okay, I just keep it.
SPEAKER_02: No overall it's fine because at first they told me like it was so bad like a full tear of the tendon some bone as well and at first it was very bad I thought but when I went to the doctor not the person who took the picture he said it's like a partial tear of the tendon and it wasn't so bad like he said if you get the surgery it would be the same result as you just lay it down don't touch it and it's gonna heal the same one just fine
SPEAKER_02: so i was just waiting for it it felt fine you know it's getting healed and like three days ago i took off my cast and i was just walking with an elastic uh you know like a bandage and i was not moving my arm it was all fine but
SPEAKER_02: a dog came up to me and i was holding a toy and by like a habit he threw it with left arm and he felt like a tick like a snap in his arm oh he took off the bandage and it looked like it got swollen or something but when he went and took a picture again the mri it looked all fine everything's getting okay be careful
SPEAKER_02: I understand. Now, Gibbs. Cast again, yeah. But he said it's fine. He said it's getting healed. He could move his arm, pronate, supinate, flexing the wrist, everything. It's okay. Listen, it is very, very arm wrestling to have starts. And now, like, we don't want to lose your left arm forever.
SPEAKER_02: Now I'll wait for my left arm to get healed and when I come back I want to get the title on lefty and by that time I think I'll progress enough and I'll get the title on right arm as well.
SPEAKER_04: Yes. But at least, Artem, you lost that match. But at least you know that there is no one unreachable. Yes. Even though you lost, you know that there is no one unreachable for you. Everything is possible.
SPEAKER_00: In general, I understood that everything was in my head. This time I flew with my wife, and she was very much in tune with me. She always watches the fights, and she says, I see when you come out, you seem to be ready physically, but when you come out, you are so gloomy, without mood, I already understand that something is wrong, so you can lose. That's why this time she
SPEAKER_00: It's like, come on, drown.
SPEAKER_02: uh-huh now this time i understood really well that it's all in the head every time uh before when i was competing my wife was watching my matches and every time she told me you look like you're physically ready but you you look like sad or not focused and grumpy and you she could tell that he's ready mentally but he can lose just because and this time she was with him and she was really supporting him because he was angry he was angry arton
SPEAKER_04: One week before the Vitaly match on Instagram you posted a post saying thank you to my haters or something like this. Do you remember that?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, you made a beast out of me. This is what happened. They made a beast out of me. They made a beast out of me, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, Artem, every event, we need that beast. Every event. Yes, this beast will be needed at every event. I will always try. From now on, I'll try every time to get it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Artem, possibly the next event will be King of the Table 14 and possibly will be in Kazakhstan. He froze up, I think. No, he didn't freeze up, he got angry and that's his doing, his intimidation.
SPEAKER_02: My hands are shaking already. Tyoma! I can hear him sometimes, but... Your video is hanging and you can't hear it. It's very scary. Look at him, his... Yeah, yeah. His soul. Is it okay now?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, now better, I think. I hope it's here. I'll hope for it.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah so when are you gonna start training april yeah he was training legs and right arm uh-huh yeah
SPEAKER_04: What do you think about the match? What are your impressions?
SPEAKER_00: Hermes is very strong. He was not in a hurry, he seemed to give Michael an opportunity to fight. Yes, he did something there, he didn't even strain himself. But on the one hand, it's right, because if you start attacking Michael right away, you might just get hit in the wrist. That's why he waited patiently and attacked when needed.
SPEAKER_02: now he was just incredibly strong and very calm like surprisingly calm he was letting it to go to this side just climbing climbing it was perfect because he wasn't uh scared and he wasn't trying to hit because if you hit michael your wrist will go and the side pressure as well like it wasn't uh it wasn't a good idea so he he was perfectly calm just great artist you know and and what does he think about
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about Vitaly against top guys on the right? Well, as for me, he will defeat everyone. He needs to fight with Levan or with Larratt.
SPEAKER_02: I think he would beat anyone and he just pull he should pull Levan or Devon and he's asking like is Devon versus Vitaly happening? What's the plans on that?
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I offered Devon seven, eight matches for the May event, but I think he will skip the May event. And I think yesterday he challenged Vitaly to pull in August. Yes, I think it was in May, and Devon himself offered to fight in August. Why not now? He's waiting for Vitaly, I don't know,
SPEAKER_02: Why not now? Is he waiting for Vitaly to get skinnier or something? Why is he not pulling him now? I think he wants to pull May event and then he wants to pull in August. If he wants, he can ask to him. If he wants, he can ask to him.
SPEAKER_00: Ah, so he chooses his own opponents. So, Gennady is injured, then Chen Shou in the 105th,
SPEAKER_02: So he's picking opponents they can win against, picking Chen Xiong one of five, Oleg Petrenko, who isn't that big, picking on Gennady with an injury. He doesn't want to pull Vitaly, huh?
SPEAKER_04: I think he wants to pull Vitaly, but not in May event. But as far as I saw, I think he wants to pull him in August event. I have a question for Morozov. You said that, Artem, you said that if you go directly for the pin against Michael, it's very dangerous for the wrist, correct? So if you try to put it on Michael right away, it's too dangerous for the wrist and it will go away against Michael.
SPEAKER_00: Anthropometry decides a lot here. For example, Hermes is not tall. His arms are short. Yes, his arms are short, so it's dangerous for Hermes. For Vitaly himself, it's nothing, because Michael himself doesn't have long arms either.
SPEAKER_00: Vitaly has a very high hand and for him Michael is simply not an opponent. Therefore, I do not see any sense in this fight at all, because Vitaly will pass very easily. Moreover, he is fast.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think it's very dependent on, like, lever and size difference, because Ermes, he doesn't really have a big hand and long lever. And for him, it's very dangerous. But for Vitaly, he has much longer arm. Michael doesn't as well. Michael's hand is pretty small. His arm isn't that long. Vitaly's very long fingers, very long hand, very big.
SPEAKER_02: He thinks that Vitaly would beat easily Michael and it's not really a match. Vitaly would go right through him pretty easily and it's not dangerous. Yeah, but when did we see someone going right through Michael? Even Pushkar in his prime, he had some problems when he was trying to...
SPEAKER_04: Do you think that it is possible to beat Michael without the shoulder pressure? I think yes, if you have enough speed. I think yes, if you are fast enough. Yeah, but who is that fast enough? Pushkar was like... And then he went... You know, like...
SPEAKER_00: You see, with Michael you can't play these pull-ups. With Michael you can't do that. With Vitaly it always becomes... And that's it. Vitaly has a very good movement here. He falls clearly, his arm is relaxed. And when they try to pull him over, Michael, if he tries to pull him over, he won't let him do it.
SPEAKER_00: So you don't have to strain yourself. Yes, Vitaly will attack with relaxed hands. Even if he pulls like this, he will feel that his wrist is floating a little. He will be able to do it now. He showed it to me in the fight.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think Vitaly's fast enough and good enough that he's just, like, he's splitting it. You shouldn't really load with Michael and try to get into, like, this motion against him and try to stretch out his arm. Vitaly sets up, just relax, and just off the goal. This movement for him is just very good and very strong. He thinks that he's just going to pit him. Okay, just saying it, just saying it.
SPEAKER_04: they are in strap and Vitaly hit and then like five centimeter here he lost his wrist yeah he said that even if that's if even if this happens and Vitaly feels that this is going it feels like Vitaly is just gonna stand up and shoulder pressure yeah but who has better shoulder pressure you think with right arm Vitaly or Hermes
SPEAKER_04: In my opinion, it's Hermes. Hermes is much stronger. So even Hermes had a very big problem, you know, like last... It was very hard, you know. And I'm afraid if that mess stops, in my opinion, it will be a nightmare for Vitaly. You know, Hermes is stronger because his arm is a little shorter than Vitaly's. Vitaly, despite the fact that he has a long arm,
SPEAKER_00: This side movement, he showed incredible numbers, 130 kg on measurements from Ivan Matyushenko. These are huge numbers. And I'm sure that he will try to punch to the side, open the corner, and then he will be able to push to the triceps, but not like this, but like this, because he has a long arm, he will have an advantage.
SPEAKER_02: Now, I feel like Ermes is stronger pressed because his hand isn't that long. With Vitaly, his hand and arm are very long, and he has insane amount of side pressure. On Ivan Matyushenko's gym, he showed like 130 kilograms of side pressure, and it's incredible for his lever. I feel like he's gonna hit Michael sideways, open up his angle, and then he's gonna press him but not flop.
SPEAKER_02: I may be wrong, but I have this feeling, this vision.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, of course I can be wrong. It's just how I feel like it's going to go and how I see it's going to go. Yeah, because I have seen Vitaly struggling with Ferit Osmanlı and he was struggling with some other guys. He tried to do this, so it didn't seem to me super impressive. Yeah, it didn't. I mean, honestly, he did with the left arm to Morozov, but I don't know if it was because Artem was injured.
SPEAKER_02: Or it was because Vitaly with the left arm progressed a lot? You can translate, yeah. I noticed that when he was fighting with Firito, he also had problems here. And what about your match? When he pressed you without a brush, I'm not sure if it was because you had an injury or because he progressed to the left and... It's unclear. Well, you know...
SPEAKER_00: It's hard for me to judge, too, because... I just didn't want to fight in the third round. I didn't have... I couldn't put pressure on him. And he successfully put pressure on me. But it's not an excuse, it's not an excuse. What happened is what happened. I don't think Vitaly was in a great shape either. I don't think so, to be honest.
SPEAKER_02: Because of the injury or because she was exhausted in general? Yes, I could hold her like that, but she crunched in the first round, and she crunched in the second round, and I couldn't hold her in the third round.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, like it's side pressure, because here I could hold and it was fine, but first round it cracked, second round it cracked, and by round three it's just... It was nothing in the setup as well, like he tried to get in setup, he said it's not an excuse, just... No, no, no, no, it's not, he's only analyzing, only analyzing, I don't think he's excusing, because I also think the same way, you know, like I... But he said as well, like I don't think that Vitaly was in a super shape as well, I don't think so.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. I understand. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and what makes you like, I mean, does he think that we tell you with right arm has proved his shoulder pressure? .
SPEAKER_00: Here is where I may be mistaken but I just feel like his right arm can do it better than his left.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but is there anything that has he ever seen that like, yes, Engin, don't you remember this match he did this and he was very effective? I have seen him trying to do this maybe against Zaur, maybe against Ferit, but I don't see him like being so effective. Maybe he didn't need it, but I have seen him try. But majority of the matches he didn't need, you know, like... No.
SPEAKER_00: You know, I just know that Vitaly, when he lost to Zaur, when he lost to Farid, when he lost to Dave Chaffee for the first time, Dmitry Vasilayev, he had shoulder problems. That is, the shoulder did not allow him to do the pronation of the shoulder, the side movement. Therefore, all the same, here, when you try to push with a flop,
SPEAKER_00: And then he got better and we see how he shows himself in fights.
SPEAKER_02: I know that in his previous matches, Dave Chafee, Zaur, Dmitry Silayev, he had some problems on his right shoulder. And he had problems doing this, like internal rotation. And I know that when you try to flop and you're doing this, it's still a lot of pressure on your shoulder. I thought the flop was more like forward, you know, not to...
SPEAKER_02: Not like this so much, but more like forward. He tried to push forward, not to the side, but he tried to push forward with a flop. Maybe that's how he tried, because he couldn't push with his shoulder.
SPEAKER_04: I noticed that it's like a habit for him, maybe because he couldn't go sideways, but I noticed that he tries to push forward with the triceps, you know, he tries to finish there. Yeah, and so basically he thinks that, you know, Vitaly has proved himself to finish Michael with the shoulder pressure. The reason I am asking, I see...
SPEAKER_04: Laletin taking the hand, taking the wrist, but he may even finish. But I'm just saying that, just say that he couldn't last this. So, very clear way I will ask, simple way, he thinks that even
SPEAKER_02: He cannot beat Michael, he can end him with the shoulder pressure, right? He said this already, but I just want to make sure that if he really believes it. Yes, I just want to make sure that if he really believes it. Yes, I just want to make sure that if he really believes it. Yes, I just want to make sure that if he really believes it. Yes, I just want to make sure that if he really believes it. Yes, I just want to make sure that if he really believes it. Yes, I just want to make sure that if he really believes it.
SPEAKER_04: Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. I understand. Yeah. And I'm not sure about that one. Yeah. I respect his opinion. And there is a possibility, as he said, there may be flash pain or something. But if the match somehow stops, I think that may become a nightmare, you know. Yeah. And how does he see Devon versus Vitaly? Yes. Devon versus Vitaly. How do you see it?
SPEAKER_00: Well, Devon doesn't want to right now. He probably wants to see how Michael will fight with him, how he will fight... Who else did he have in mind? North American. Ah, to see how it will be. Well, that's the difference. Vitaly, even being injured...
SPEAKER_00: He doesn't talk about it and doesn't run away from his opponents, doesn't give up on fights, no matter what. I don't know why Devon doesn't want to test himself with the strongest. Devon doesn't give up.
SPEAKER_00: Vitaly doesn't give up, even if he has a trauma. I don't know why Devon doesn't want to test himself with a strong opponent. He's already fought with Hermes, but only Vitaly. It's interesting for everyone to watch.
SPEAKER_00: Or he doesn't want to fight after sparring with Tolik in Turkey because he understands that there is nothing to do? I don't know. It's weird because it feels like he wants Michael to go first or Jerry, I don't know. Just to see how they pull against Vitaly for some reason, I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Even if he has some problems or injury, he just goes away and pulls anyway. I don't understand why Devin doesn't want to test himself against a really strong opponent. Because he pulled basically everyone from super heavyweights. And Vitaly is probably the only one that he doesn't pull yet. Maybe it's in Turkey when they try to practice pull. He felt something and he doesn't want to pull anymore. I'm not so sure. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but what do you think, Artem, that he challenged him to pull in August? Well, he will make Vitaly even stronger. Because Vitaly will start training now, fight with Mike, then continue to train.
SPEAKER_00: Or maybe Devon wants to gain more weight by that time, because he understands that he won't have time to prepare something against Vitaly before May. I don't know, I just don't understand. They were going to fight in May. Why not?
SPEAKER_02: I'm just a bit confused why it's August. Maybe because I feel like he will make Vitaly even stronger because of this. Vitaly is going to get strong, going to pull Michael. After that, he's going to train even more till August and get even better. Maybe he wants to, maybe Devin wants to gain some weight even more till August. Just I'm very confused why it's not now.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but does he not think that it is a disadvantage for Vitaly to pull three supermatches in three... Sorry, two supermatches with the same arm in three months? And this can also happen, and this can also happen. I can't say anything here. I'll write it down for you.
SPEAKER_00: It's just confidential information. I want to warn you right away. Vitaly won't be in good shape in August. I'll better explain it to you, because I can't say it yet.
SPEAKER_02: You know, I, I, I can't really say it on stream. I will message you privately about Vitaly in August. Uh, I have like something to say to you, uh, privately, cause he doesn't want to say it here. Okay. Okay. Okay. So anyways, so, and what did you think about Hermes versus Levan? Hermes and Levan, what do you think?
SPEAKER_00: It seems to me that Levan's wrist hasn't fully recovered yet, or he still has some kind of fear. That is, he no longer works with his wrist as before, he does not bend it as before. This was just visible in the fight with Devon. I'm not saying that Devon is a weak opponent. He was preparing for Levan, for this movement.
SPEAKER_00: Levan this time could win it only once with a flop and a top pass in the other times. But this shows that his hand, as it seemed to me, does not work as well as before. And Hermes, he pulls very well now. That is, he adds, yes. And it seems to me that
SPEAKER_00: Of course, the speed, again, as last time, will be on the side of Lebanon, but it depends on how many rounds. It will be six rounds anyway. It will be interesting. Plus, Hermes showed how resilient he is, what a strong angle he has, stretch. That is, it will be interesting for me to see. 50 to 50, I think, this time. Well, maybe a slight overweight towards Lebanon.
SPEAKER_02: When I watch his matches, I just feel like Levan's wrist, maybe it's the injury style, maybe he's scared to do it, but I just don't see him working with the wrist the same way he did before, like the flexing.
SPEAKER_02: I saw it against Devin. I don't say that Devin is a weak opponent. He was getting very ready. He was training that movement. But I just noticed that against Devin, he won one round with the flop. And then he went outside and pulled him. I just don't see him going the same dominant way. Hermes, on the other hand, he's gotten much better. His...
SPEAKER_02: all these weights coming up he's getting really strong and this time i would say it's 50 50 maybe with a slight advantage to levan but i'm just very interested to see this match again because ermis proved his endurance he's very good in endurance and uh the speed is still gonna be on levan's side i feel like i think i think this is because of the hand advantage
SPEAKER_04: When you have a stronger hand, you do the movement. When you are losing, you are more defensive, unless you are Jerry Cadoret. I think it has a lot to do with Levan's wrist. Because if Levan can control,
SPEAKER_04: But if he cannot do this, if he only pulls back, and then if Hermes has the pronator, then he may still go there. So I think that's very important, you know, how strong Levan's wrist will be for that match. I know for sure that Hermes is not going there to perform.
SPEAKER_04: Worse than last time. I shouldn't say maybe worse, but he's going there to perform better than last time. I don't know if he's going to end up winning or not, but that is his plan. But he's going there to win. I don't know if he can do that or not. But that is, even though Lewand won the first match, it is still a bit personal for him. Because after that match, he...
SPEAKER_04: had a lot of criticism you know I don't know exactly why but and then I think he wants to go there to prove that I think it is more personal for Levan than than Hermes. Hermes is going there just to fulfill his dream while
SPEAKER_02: I don't think being in Hermes is Levan's dream, but he wants to prove something. That the first match was just a one-time thing, in my opinion. In terms of Kistya, do you know what he thinks about this speed? Because when you win, Kistya's movement immediately turns out. When you lose it, you start to defend more, and this is very important. And he agrees that Levan somehow...
SPEAKER_02: it goes differently and if he can control the pronator of Hermes then he will put it but if it goes away then Hermes again in this position will stop and this is with the pronator if he has it he will stay he starts again pull pull pull and this time, although Levan won the previous fight, somehow it remained to prove that what happened in the first match is only a one-off case, in short, only once
SPEAKER_00: Hermes is going there, he's motivated, you could see that he's not going there just to fight, he's going to win. I want to add that, for example, two boxers meet, they have a fight, 12 rounds, and one of the boxers wins 8 rounds, but in the last one,
SPEAKER_02: You know, he wants to add like an analogy. Like imagine two boxers fighting and one of them leads very heavily for eight rounds and is beating him. But in ninth round he gets very tired and he cancels the match on the ninth round. Who does win?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, no, it's not the same thing. Because to win in armwrestling, winning four rounds is enough. While we for sure know that as long as there is no knockouts, that it needs to happen 12 rounds, you know. So that is not the same exact thing, you know. Artem, you're going to make Levon angry.
SPEAKER_04: I just decided to add some oil to the fire. He's stirring the pot a bit. Yeah, yeah, I know. He's doing a good job, you know, yeah. And people are asking, so who's winning, Vitaly or Devon, if they pull in August? People are asking, who will win in August if Vitaly and Devon fight? Vitaly. Vitaly. What's the percentage? Percentage? 70 to 30.
SPEAKER_04: 70 30. 70 30. i understand yeah we will see we will see we will see how it will go and do you think that if michael beats
SPEAKER_00: Vitaly, in May, if this match happens, Vitaly should still pull against Devon? First of all, Michael is a very good person, I respect him, he's really cool, and he's always kind to me.
SPEAKER_00: should not be there friendship, I just judge as I see and as I know, well, there will be no such thing that Michael will beat Vitaly, there will be no Vitaly now just gaining, that is, he is Michael, you see, if you judge by the fight with Kamil Yablonsky, yes, that is, it was a long time with Gennady Kikini, who
SPEAKER_00: Even when you have a torn biceps, even when you press your side and use a flop in the triceps, this biceps doesn't allow you to work out fully. Not like before. The fights were very difficult. As for me, Vitaly is a 100% favorite here, and what Michael will lose will not happen.
SPEAKER_02: You know, I just with all due respect to Michael, I think he's a great person and I love him. I just there is no chance for him to win against Vitaly. There's just no way Vitaly is 100% favorite against him because all the matches Michael like Camille, Gennady were the torn biceps.
SPEAKER_02: Kamil took a very long time, it was a hard match. Gennady, even though someone might say, like, you have only biceps turn, you still can go sideways. I don't think so. It still gets you a lot of problems, man. It was still a very hard match. I just don't see... It's too close of a matches and they took too long to give something to Vitaly and just too big of a difference. Okay, the question is that what is the style that
SPEAKER_02: Both Gennady and Kamil applied and to give trouble to Michael. And how good is Vitaly in that style compared to these two guys? Yes, Kamil and Gennady, in what style did they create problems for Michael? Here the question is already how good Vitaly is in this style, that is, to press with a hammer and throw there. This is already the question, that is, this is the biggest thing that is important.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I explained it already. Vitaly will have a hard time pulling on himself because of his long arm. He will attack with the side, the pronator, the top, fall. And even if he doesn't manage to finish it right away, he won't put his shoulder like this, he will close it like this, because he has a long arm.
SPEAKER_02: No, still, very sure that even though Vitaly, like, he thinks that he will pin him, just back pressure, pronation, everything, still, even if he gets stopped, his hand is just so long that he'll just cut him off and shoulder pressure him. Not try to flop him. He doesn't need to stop. He won't flop. His hand is just so long, he will cut off... Yeah, but if his hand is so long to do that, why he's risking it like this with...
SPEAKER_04: hermes and then with sometimes with zaur sometimes with uh ferret you know that he went and he lost his wrist and he also lost his wrist against morozov i mean his arm is so long but he lost his wrist what makes him what makes like morozov think it is impossible
SPEAKER_04: vitality to lose his wrist. Like, I mean, Pushkar lost his wrist against him. I have seen Devon is losing his wrist against him. I have seen
SPEAKER_04: Hermes losing his wrist, I mean, at some point to finish he had to do this. He couldn't just, if Hermes could finish with wrist like this, he could finish it, right? I mean, so he had to do this to finish it. So what I'm just saying that when Michael, against Michael, almost everyone lost his wrist, like, and we have seen Vitaly losing his wrist. What makes him think that, like, just because his arm is so tall, he's not going to lose his wrist?
SPEAKER_02: When Vitaly fought with Hermes, we saw that his wrist was gone. We saw how his wrist was gone when he tried to finish him off. If Hermes could finish him off, he would also try, but no. What makes you think that when he hits, his wrist won't go away against Michael? Because we saw that even against you his wrist went away. Denis Tsyplenkov's wrist didn't go away against Michael in the first round.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I need to go back and check. I need to check. I'm not sure for sure. Well, yes, I also said something, and now I'm thinking to check. Well, as for me, Denis Lefkoe won the first rounds. Well, this is my opinion. It seems to me that this long arm of Vitaly, he even...
SPEAKER_02: yeah just my opinion i just feel like his head is so long and if he gets to that michael won't be able to open it up you know that's just how i feel
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I don't know. Ermes said that he couldn't really control Michael's tornado. So I'm just thinking, I think Michael is the wrong person to underestimate and to compare Vitaly with Gennady and Kamil. They only had to do this. And I think that they are stronger than Vitaly about this. And Vitaly is totally different way, you know, he's going. Anyway, so time will show. I have a question for Arthur.
SPEAKER_04: I think maybe two questions, but let me ask the first one. First of all, you were getting ready for Levan Saginashvili in 2023. And then you had a match with Corey West. We saw your shape, your incredible shape. And then Levan injured his wrist, and then you had some health problems with your stomach.
SPEAKER_04: Compared to that shape, because that time you also look incredible, which shape of you is better, you know, was better? The shape that we saw you in Tbilisi or the shape that you were getting ready for Levan?
SPEAKER_02: When you were preparing for Levan in 2023, you fought with Corey on the left and then you had problems with your stomach, Levan's wrist was torn off. In your opinion, which form was better, the one that was in Tbilisi now or when you were preparing for Levan in 2023, because you looked very strong there too? Well, in some ways, Tbilisi was better, of course, but
SPEAKER_00: At that time, it was as if my side was a little better, as if it just bothered me less, the elbow. Now it bothers me, but it's normal. But again, it needs to be trained, strengthened, and then it will be visible. But it seems to me that it was better in Tbilisi.
SPEAKER_02: You know, in some parts in Tbilisi, I was better, but like in elbow, let's say side pressure, I felt like less pain and more comfortable in 23 when I was preparing. It's just very hard to assess, but I just feel like Tbilisi was probably a bit better. I was in a better shape in Tbilisi, but I'll train, get healthy, you know, and then we'll know.
SPEAKER_04: Another question. We saw how good his left arm was in Tbilisi. Did he also train his right arm while he was preparing? Did he also have specific training for his right arm when he was training? When you were preparing for this match, did you train your right arm specifically or only your left one?
SPEAKER_00: I did the same thing with my right hand, because to better understand what to do with the left hand, I did the same thing with the right hand, that is, with the right hand it turned out better, and then I do it with the right hand, the coach will say, clearly, let's do it the same way, now with the left hand, I kind of adjusted the left one to the right.
SPEAKER_02: everything i did with my left i did with my right as well because uh it's important i feel like um when you do something let's say on the right arm and you understand it very well then you can use it on left arm as well let's say i'm doing an exercise i do with my right cautious coach says perfect do the same left and it transfers that ability between arms it's very important like
SPEAKER_04: So the question is, if he would pull right arm as well, would the result be different than the actual right arm match? What does he think? With Vitaly, right? Yeah. If he fought with Vitaly on the right, would it be a different outcome? 100% it would be a different fight because, again, I talked about my wife at the beginning.
SPEAKER_00: In these six months that have passed, my brain says to me, you went to the right hand that time, you didn't want to fight at all.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, you came out as a fool. Yes, but the shape was different.
SPEAKER_04: And I want to show something here. He said that didn't go. So was his wrist going back as well? Yes, but look how well Denis holds, despite the fact that he doesn't have as long arms as Vitaly.
SPEAKER_00: Despite the fact that Denis never takes it like this. Never. Denis has big fingers, he always takes it low. That is, this is what gave Michael an advantage in their fight. And Vitaly always rubs it so that he has a big finger.
SPEAKER_00: You know, still, even in this clip, Dennis, who doesn't have as long of an arm, he's still... No, no, no, I'm not comparing a lot of things with Dennis. You don't need to translate all this. I'm just saying that
SPEAKER_02: He said that Dennis didn't lose his wrist. Every time Dennis hit, his wrist was... Yes. I understand. But he said about Michael as well with Vitaly. He sets up like very high and it's very hard to explain. Like you won't understand it until you grip up with Vitaly and you set up. Because like he sets up with his thumb so weird and it's so uncomfortable when Michael pulls him. He will feel very bad in the setup and he will feel very uncomfortable.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but the same Vitaly also. Listen, Vitaly is great. I'm telling you, Vitaly is the guy that I want to set against Levan Saginashvili. Vitaly is, in my head, is just great right here. But what I'm just saying that to say that Michael doesn't have chance, it just like also like blows my mind, you know, just to think that because like we have seen Vitaly hitting against Ferit and having problem with Zaur head problem with, with,
SPEAKER_04: Hermes, he went here and he lost his wrist. So Vitaly still was 204 centimeter guy. It was the same guy, same. He didn't grow since last time. So what I'm just saying is just because he has tall forearm, it doesn't mean that he doesn't lose the wrist. This is what I try to explain. So he doesn't have a wrist that is unbendable. I think that the strongest, I would say, is Levan Saginashvili.
SPEAKER_04: I think his wrist. Other than his wrist, I have seen Devon's wrist moving, Hermes' wrist moving, like everyone. Michael's wrist also goes back. But the bad part is that when he goes, he pronates and he also makes your wrist, you know, come into the same position. So, I mean, just listen, Artyom, if you ever pull Michael, I hope you don't underestimate him because you look like you don't think he's dangerous.
SPEAKER_02: For me, Vitaly is the strongest athlete in my head. I want to put him against Levan Saginashvili, he is a very strong athlete. For me, it's unreal that you underestimate Michael. You say that he has no chance against Vitaly.
SPEAKER_02: It was clear for Vitaly how he fought against Hermes, for everyone, even for Devon. He was the only person in my head, for Vance Ginashvili, for everyone else I saw how the hand moved away. And I hope that if you fight Michael and you have a match, you won't underestimate him. Because when he goes there, even though he loses his hand, he also prunes and the opponent's hand moves away too.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I understand, of course, I will not underestimate, because in our city there was one athlete who fought in the same way, that is, I don't know, when Michael Todd started to fight like that, he also started to fight like that, and that is, I fought with him, and I understand perfectly well what kind of technique it is and all its inconveniences, I roughly understand how to fight it, that is,
SPEAKER_00: That's why I analyze my fight with that person. I understand that the fight between Vitaly and Michael will be about the same. I'm not underestimating, it just seems to me that it will be exactly as I say.
SPEAKER_02: You know, I don't underestimate Michael. And if we pull, I'll get prepared because I have a person who pulls just like Michael in our city. And when I pull him, I know the uncomfortable parts, you know, the bad parts about that style when you pull against them. And I just feel like when I pull against that person, I see the same outcome with Michael and Vitaly as well. But it doesn't mean that I underestimate Michael. I just, that's how I see the match, you know.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The only problem is that this guy has wins against Pushkar, has win rounds winning against Denis Diplanko, has beaten Devin, you know. And so it's a little bit probably more dangerous than the guy in his town, you know. Boss Royal is asking, Artem, do you think Devin is scared of Vitaly? That's a very provocative question. That's a very provocative question. Do you think Devin is scared of Vitaly?
SPEAKER_00: well, otherwise, why then transfer this fight to August, yes, if you can do it now, it seems to me, yes, he wants to see how Michael fights with him to understand some, maybe his weaknesses, maybe he himself wants to prepare even harder and lost his mind
SPEAKER_02: I don't see any other reason why he would postpone the match. I just feel like he wants to see Michael Pullum or any other people and just see the weaknesses of Vitaly where he has some problems. It gets stronger as well when the match... I don't see any other reason for him postponing the match.
SPEAKER_04: Listen, the second part to get ready for getting bigger or ready for Lallatin, I understand that part. But to say that he's looking for weakness, don't you think that Lallatin has been around long enough to see what he has, pluses and minuses? I mean, does he really need to think one more match to understand that?
SPEAKER_02: Look, Vitaly has been fighting for so many years, and there have been so many matches that it's pretty clear where his weaknesses are, where his strengths are, and it makes sense for Devon to wait for one more match and wait for something new. Well, I don't know what it makes sense if Vitaly didn't lose to East vs West on the right, as far as I remember.
SPEAKER_04: No, yeah, that's why I'm confused as well. Like why, as I know, Vitaly hasn't lost a right arm match on East vs. West, I think, no? I mean, I mean, we count both events. King of the Table, East vs. West. I think King of the Table, he has lost against Dave Chappie once, but later he beat him. And then he has another loss against Hermes. But it was King of the Table, yeah. Yeah, King of the Table, yeah. But we combine East vs. West and King of the Table.
SPEAKER_00: Only Vitaly is left to fight Devon. Is he really... Hello? Yes, I can hear you. Only Vitaly is left to fight Devon. Does he really not want to check for himself? Why does he say that he will lose at least three games against North America? Why? He can fight Michael later. At the moment, I think...
SPEAKER_02: I think Larratt will beat Michael. Because Vitaly is the only one left, Devon should be so eager to pull Vitaly as well because it's an interesting match. Why he's saying like at least three North American people can pull you. Why? I don't understand this part. Michael can pull him later. Yeah, but what if Devon wants to be ready for August?
SPEAKER_04: Instead of May, there is something wrong with it. I just have to try to understand. I would want May event, Devon and Vitaly. But I would want that, you know, just now. I know LaLatine is ready. If Devon just says, okay, you know what I mean? I would set that. Not that because I don't want, I want that. But if he feels that he's going to be ready in August, what's wrong with that? Like he's going to pull anyways.
SPEAKER_02: So does he think that, like, I mean, something is wrong with that? Here's the answer to the question.
SPEAKER_02: Does he want to get ready? He's afraid, so he wants to get ready. So there's the answer. He wants to get ready, postpone the match a little bit to make it later, get very ready, because he's scared right now. Yeah, but as long as he's pulling him, is it okay? Yeah, but as long as he's pulling him, is it okay?
SPEAKER_04: Or one more thing, does Morozov think that if it is in August, Vitaly cannot be a winner?
SPEAKER_00: There may be some problems, for example, with Vitaly's preparation in the summer. There may be, but this is not for sure. This is just information that cannot be disclosed.
SPEAKER_02: you know i'll write you like privately why if it's later after in summer after summer vitaly may have some problems with uh preparing but we just talk about that in uh privately he's not sure not 100 but still he would like to talk with you about the after summer okay okay somebody just asked here so it reminded me good does alijan have chance against vitaly with left arm
SPEAKER_00: In the chat they asked if there are any chances for Alizhan against Vitaly. I think there are always chances. Even as they said, as in my case, zero. But you see, it turned out well. I think I fought well.
SPEAKER_00: There were chances, I lost, but I wasn't 100% ready. No, I was 100% ready, but Vitaly was ready, which means he was better. That's why I won. Well, Alizhan has all the chances.
SPEAKER_02: You know, I feel like there's always chances, because people were saying the same about me, and we saw how that happened. Like, I think I was in a great shape, I gave a great fight, I'm very happy. Like, maybe Vitaly was in even a better shape, that's what you want. But still, I feel like Elijan has all the chances, and, like, why not? But when you say chances, like, how much? Well, as Vitaly would say, 50-50.
SPEAKER_04: Like how Vitaly would say, 50-50. Okay, 50-50. Okay. But isn't he incredible, Artem? 105-kilo guy and having 50-50 chance against the superweight champion. Imagine that this is impossible with the right arm category. And it just shows how great Ali Can. Possibly, Ali Can Murado is the pound-for-pound best
SPEAKER_04: Thank you, brother.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you, thank you. He was talking about Alizhan, how incredible it is that a 105 kg guy has a 50-50 chance with a super heavyweight, because it's impossible to do that on the right, 105 kg. And as for me, Alizhan, in principle, now the ratio of weight to strength, most likely the best that there is now, the best of all time is John Brzenk.
SPEAKER_00: And Lejean now on the left shows just incredible results, that he is only 105 kg and competes against super-heavyweights. Well, he's still gaining weight, I think that it can be better. The main thing is that this extra set does not interfere with him. That is, after all, he is not a natural heavyweight, right? Well, although there is how to look, if he seems to look like he is without excess weight.
SPEAKER_00: without excess water seems to be so healthy it's all you just need to be a fight will be visible and so you know well, I think there are chances for everyone many factors can, for example, interfere with the same Vitaly before or something to play in the plus Alizhana a lot of different factors therefore it is necessary to wait to watch and
SPEAKER_02: Alijan is still progressing still getting bigger and stronger I just I'm not sure if he should get a lot bigger because he's not like a naturally super heavyweight guy he doesn't have a lot of
SPEAKER_02: water in him not a lot of excess weight he's very good right now and he's still getting stronger as of Vitaly's match I just feel like Alijan can have some factors that would favor him and Vitaly can have some uncomfortable spots with Alijan like everything is possible and everyone has chances you know it's just there is no really point in predicting I feel like a match before you actually see it
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. But does it mean that pound for pound Alizhan is the strongest left? Do you think Alizhan is the top one in terms of weight and strength? It's hard to translate pound for pound into Russian. I get it. It's like Khabib Dourbagamidov. Damn, it's hard.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know on the left oleg zhok the same date he is also not he weighs less but also very strong as if damn who else we have leftists there are such I don't know but I can only call two zhok and muratov all
SPEAKER_02: Is there a system like Wilks in powerlifting? I don't know. It's very difficult because Jacques is the only one that I could name. But he's lighter as well than Alijan. I feel like it's very difficult to count because there is not a formula that counts.
SPEAKER_04: Alijan and Jacques are the two that pops up in my head, you know, first. And the question is, Dadikyan at 115 kilo probably is like better than him performing at 105. Like 115 kilo is more like his natural weight. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, Dadikyan is 115 now, he still feels good, it's better for him. He's healthier, better, and at 105 he somehow cut more, 115 now performed very well for him. He's more natural, he's done 115. Yes, yes, well, by the way, it's also interesting how David Dadikyan is left now.
SPEAKER_00: Now he will rest and 100% prepare again. Again, Vitaly and I always fought behind the scenes. There was no such thing that Vitaly dominated 100%. They fought. Although it's behind the scenes, but still. There are a lot of videos. David is also very strong.
SPEAKER_02: David is very interesting for me as well because if he rests a bit gets prepared again for 100% on left arm it's very interesting to see him because he had after pulls like behind the scenes on practice table with Vitaly and Vitaly was not dominating him and there is like they pulled a lot of times and it's still... When? When did they fight Vitaly? 2022 Siberian Power Show.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, it was like two, three years ago and he was 22. Yeah. I think Vitaly was taking his wrist but he couldn't finish it. I think, yeah, I think I shouldn't be here. He was like jamming in the shoulder. Like this? Yeah, okay. Yeah, but now Vitaly is stronger and...
SPEAKER_04: Both are, compared to last three years, I mean, compared to three years ago, I mean, they are both stronger. Was it a surprise that he can beat Kordachev? No, no. I have a friend who made bets. And he asked me who to bet on.
SPEAKER_00: I told him to bet 100% on Dadikyan. He was in doubt for a long time, but he made a bet and won. But where he didn't listen to me, he lost. You know, it wasn't really a surprise for me. I knew 100% and that was my friend. He was betting on Dadikyan and I was telling him, bet on Dadikyan, for sure, for sure, 100%.
SPEAKER_02: Barely he met him back and he won but other matches where he didn't listen to Artem he lost.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, okay. Artom, the betting advisor. Artom, okay, now I just prepare my question with all these Alijan and David subjects. What would happen if they meet in 115 kilo?
SPEAKER_04: And I want to ask another thing. If this was in 105 kilo, I would say for sure, Alijan, 105 kilo.
SPEAKER_04: Because David is coming from 120 kilo to down, and I think he's losing so much weight. And if it is 115 kilo, Ali Can is around 105 kilo, 106 kilo. So if it is 105 kilo world title match, who's winning?
SPEAKER_02: 105 or 15? I'm sorry, 115, I'm sorry. Yes, yes, yes. Because if you put them at 105, then Deccan loses so much weight, and Alijan is already at 105, as for me, it's 100% Alijan. But at 115, Alijan is at 105, 106, and David is right there. How do you see how this match will go? Here endurance will decide, I think.
SPEAKER_00: It will decide endurance. I'm not going to talk about who will win or not. For example, at the World Championship, let it be three years ago, in 2022, we have a comrade on the team, Boris Gapchenko. He is about the same as David Boryts, and he took Olezhan very well.
SPEAKER_00: Alizhan was holding him by the pillow and started to pull him out. In the end, he won. I don't know if David has enough strength to break through from there. And if he has enough, will he have enough endurance to hold him there? Will it be enough to crush him later? Therefore, here it will be decided by the endurance of the one who takes the middle. It was very interesting to look at this fight.
SPEAKER_02: know i think endurance is very important this match because in 2022 on worlds um there's my my friend boris kapchenko he pulled against alijan and he pulls very similarly to david and when he when he got him on his side and started to he was back and alijan was getting him back out of here and and he couldn't finish him and the question here is uh will uh will david have enough power to get him through center
SPEAKER_02: And then will he have enough endurance and power to actually finish him? And that's why I feel like endurance is very important in this match. And it's going to be very interesting. He doesn't say anything clearly. He doesn't want to say, but with the example he's giving, it looks like he thinks it's Alijan. You don't want to choose someone, but you gave such an example, as if you think it's still Alijan.
SPEAKER_00: Approximately, yes. I want to see an interesting fight, so I told David what to do for an interesting fight. David was interested in this too, so I told him that there would be few moments for Alizhan.
SPEAKER_02: you know because i really want an interesting match and with this example i i kind of told that account what what to do because daddy cam was talking about with that about alijan much for me as well and i just said like what moments are very important you know i just really want to see an interesting match yeah yeah anyway so um let's let's go
SPEAKER_04: One provocative question and then very quickly I'm going to ask the predictions, you know, about the upcoming East vs West 17. The provocative question is coming. What would happen if Morozov would pull Devon with left arm in Tbilisi instead of Vitaly Lalesin? I have a question for you. Before we move on to the East vs West 17 match, what would happen if you went to Tbilisi with Devon instead of Vitaly?
SPEAKER_04: Every Devon fan would become my fan. That's interesting. Okay, let's talk about the East vs West 17 Arlington Cards. Dave Chaffee vs Georgy Svetkov.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think Georgi said problem. Okay. Artem, do you think there is a possibility? Who has the better side pressure?
SPEAKER_02: chaffee is there any possibility chevy to go here halfway and his loosers is there any possibility him to pin like this um
SPEAKER_00: Sergey Kalinchenko couldn't do it, because he was lying on his right hand. It's very uncomfortable to fight with Georgy. Even before the Go team, he starts to twist you. You hold your fingers, but he twists your wrist, and it opens. And when they say Go, you're like this.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's very hard to pull against Georgi. I feel like he will try, Dave will try, but the question is, can he do that? Because Sergei Kalinchenko tried as well, and Tverkov was just holding him like this, you know, very close. And even in a setup, when you set up against Georgi...
SPEAKER_02: he's just he pronates so much you can already feel the the fingers and cupping and as soon as the match starts you're like already like this and it's very hard to pull against him because of this and he's very uncomfortable okay lozo is asking
SPEAKER_04: Hey Engin, are you going to give Ricard Bormann a chance at the East-West Rune? He's an exciting young talent, possibly number one in Australia already at 20 years old. He's under our radar, but I don't know when we will see. Time will show.
SPEAKER_00: Kory vs. Devon. Kory vs. Devon on the left. The fight will definitely be under the table. And maybe Kory will win the first rounds if he just fights sideways. But if he tries to fight like Kamil,
SPEAKER_00: I doubt that he has such a strong flop as Kamil. Maybe he'll take the first two rounds, then Devon will just lie down under the table, open his hand and just break up about this arthritis.
SPEAKER_02: the fighting is definitely gonna be under the table and maybe Corey can win one or two rounds the first ones if he just goes sideways but if he tries to flop I don't think he has as much power as let's say Camille I don't think he has as much flopping ability and after two rounds he will try to finish and he'll just gonna he's gonna break against the arthritis of Devin
SPEAKER_04: So he thinks that Devon is going to win 3-2? 3-2, I think. Or 3-1. 3-2, maybe 3-1. 3-1 or 3-2. Okay, I understand. And Matt Mask vs Ongar Veyar? Matt Mask vs Kedrgaly Ongar Veyar. I think Kedrgaly will win 100%.
SPEAKER_00: He seems to be cured now, he had an operation, he was cured, and if he is ready, then the matte mask will not be possible to go through his brush, it will not be possible to rub it.
SPEAKER_02: The surgery helped him a lot.
SPEAKER_00: I think it helped. Plus, he's a guy with a lot of experience, he knows how to recover from injuries, how to train. I think he'll be ready. And now he has the motivation, after the defeat of Oleg Petrenko, to win.
SPEAKER_02: yes i think it's uh it's helping him as well because he has a lot of experience he he it's already been years that he's pulling and he knows very well how to deal with injuries and how to heal properly and i just feel like that loss to Petrenko as well is just going to motivate him so much to come back and win this time okay and Mindagos Tarasaitis versus Giannis Amorins
SPEAKER_04: Yanis and Mindaugas, 77 kg. I think Mindaugas is more favorite. And so I don't want to take his time so much. I just want to ask him about John Brzezinski vs. Yoshinobu Kanai.
SPEAKER_04: Artyom, I want to ask you a question. Is John Brzenk your favorite puller? Yes. Do you think that he's the greatest ever? Of course. I just want to see, because you are from the young generation.
SPEAKER_04: I just don't know if you knew a lot about him or not, because some of the... I haven't seen any arm wrestlers, things different. But some of the fans, the newer fans, they are just thinking, oh, was he good or something? So I just wanted to be curious. Do you think that John, at the age of, what, 60, 61, does he have a chance against Yoshinobi or no?
SPEAKER_00: Now he's 60-61 against Yoshi. I think he'll win 100%. If I'm not mistaken, he turned 60 in 2022. Now he'll be 63 in the summer, if I'm not mistaken. Yoshi isn't young either.
SPEAKER_00: Yosha is not the same as he was before, when he fought with Berzenk, when Berzenk was very strong, young. He's not the same either. I think it's still Berzenk.
SPEAKER_02: No, I think 100% John is going to win. Wow. Because Yoshi, he's not young as well. He isn't what he was before when he was pulling with John as well. And I just, I don't think he's as strong as he was. And John is going to win, I think. Yeah, but what did you think? You were there as a special guest when Yoshi gave such a hard match with Tata Shinks.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, you were a guest when Hutch and Yosha fought and Yosha loaded him well. It was close. Nevertheless, I think Hutch won 3-0, right? No, 3-2. 3-2? Damn, I want to believe that in my almost 63 years
SPEAKER_02: Berzenk can still let everyone go. You know, still, I like to think that John, even at like 60 something, 61, he still can rock everyone, basically, you know, and just show a lot of people. Yeah, yeah, anyways, yeah. Anyways, Artem,
SPEAKER_04: If you want to add anything, you can add, and we are at the end of our podcast. I thank you very, very much for being part of it. And Alex, I also thank you very much for being our guest. Once again, Morozov, Artem Morozov, you have very big biceps, but your heart is bigger, bigger than your bicep. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Tell him please. Because his heart is so big he wouldn't live for so long now.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, no. He knows what I meant, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's just joking. Okay, okay, yeah. Anyways, do you have anything else to say? Anything, any message to the fans? Any message to any specific armwrestler? Anything you want to say? Anything you want to say?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know what to say to fans because they always twist it up in their way and for someone I'll still be a bad guy, for someone I'll still be a good guy. I just want to say that I'll come back and I'll destroy everyone.
SPEAKER_04: Good, good. That's what I want to hear. And one last thing. What if after this podcast, Michael comes and says, come on, come on, Artem, what are you going to say? And if now after the podcast, Michael will have to say, come on, Artem, come on, what will you say? Well, in order to say that, he needs to stop the pillows first.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, so to say that, he first has to stop me above the pad. He first say what? First he has to stop me above the pad to say that, come on, Artem, come on. No, no, when I say, come on, Artem, come on, I mean, what if he comes and challenges you right now? Yeah, but he's saying that about a match, if they pull, first... I'm not asking about the match, I'm asking, will he accept? Yes, but if Michael still asks, will you accept the match?
SPEAKER_04: of course yeah of course yeah of course okay imagine that in may devon is coming for vitaly and then michael is coming for artem it would be incredible but most likely i kind of feel that we will see michael todd versus vitaly laletin
SPEAKER_00: fight, I don't know, I'm generally also in the mood to fight, as it were, in the summer, as it were, in June, that is, I can fight and I can fight in August in the same way, that is, let's fight in August, for example, in Italy with Larratt, and I will fight with Michael in August, I will have enough, that is, how many six weeks we have between the fights, this is enough to
SPEAKER_02: You know, I'm very interested as well because I'm fine with pulling in summer like June or August and let's say in August Vitaly can pull Devon and I can pull Michael. I'm fine with that. Like we have six weeks between the matches and for me that's just enough to retain the shape or sometimes get even better. Yeah, yeah. We will see. Artem Morozov will either be pulling May event
SPEAKER_04: in in his home country or maybe in june event in u.s we will decide soon artem once again spasiba thank you very much my friend thank you thank you also take care take care guys thank you oh that was interesting yeah it was good it was a nice one yeah
