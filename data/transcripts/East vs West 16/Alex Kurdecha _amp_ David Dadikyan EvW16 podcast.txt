SPEAKER_00: it's weird because zoom it shows me that this call is being live but i don't see it at the channel no it started now oh it did okay okay yeah how's it going guys how you feel before the biggest card ever of east versus west yeah i wish we should ask you it shows we should ask you because
SPEAKER_02: You are the one who's going to compete and try to do one more step to your dream. I'm extremely excited about my match, of course. But like a fan of arm wrestling, I think I'm even more excited because of the matches which will be in one place in one day. And you know, the people who will be there. And also we have some symbolism because it's Georgia. It's like country of the strongest guy, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. So it's something very, very special. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. It is very, very important one. Yeah, very important. And your match is also very important. It is going to show where you are at and if David Dadigian belongs to that category or not.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. It's true. Do you believe that David belongs to that category? If I will be the guy who like stand opposite of this stage and analyzing everything which has happened,
SPEAKER_02: I analyzing with Morozov but also not only with Morozov but also matches with previous super heavyweights guys like he was cool with in the past yeah he was cool with even okay I can say practice with Dennis which was also show some level yeah and who else
SPEAKER_02: for sure like he one of the greatest guy of the heavyweight category but I believe he's very very you know special guy and he can pull in super heavyweight where exactly I'm not ready to tell I will tell you after the match but he's very explosive like he's very special because he's very explosive he's very
SPEAKER_03: What do you think about yourself, your explosiveness compared to his explosiveness? I think now my explosiveness is not bad. It has never been bad, but what I just tried to say, compared to him, we know that you have very good starts and do you think that
SPEAKER_03: With the start, who will end up in the offensive position, who will end up in the defense? Because you mentioned about how fast he is, how quick he is. And do you think that he will be dangerous for you or his speed will not matter? Do you see yourself the one who is leading the match? I think if I will be not sleeping, and I for sure not will be sleeping on the start,
SPEAKER_02: it should not go to that side. But, you know, if I need to think about something more than everything else, it's actually what I think now. So if about my preparation, what I do most of all, it's actually my preparation to not go in there in a bad position. So I'm working on the start, I'm working on the setup.
SPEAKER_02: Because even if he go in the hook in center, I'm okay with this. Yeah, I like be absolutely okay with this. I know that a lot of guys say that if he goes to the hook, it's like big troubles for me. But with this, I'm okay, absolutely. But what is dangerous for me is if he will be so much faster than me that he will go from the start in his best position. But I believe that in the start,
SPEAKER_02: after setup it will be strap match and i believe it will be the fight in the straps but we will see you know he's now the biggest version dennis says that he will be probably 125 kilos then he says that he will be very very strong very powerful so we will see
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so are we freezing or everything is okay, right? You guys see? Yeah, I was good. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yep.
SPEAKER_02: yeah but i saw another another video he said that he was when he accepted the match he was 121 22 and then he went somehow went down to lighter weight and he's hoping to be 118. so i don't know i i not believe this i know i i heard it as well yeah i heard it as well i remember i see his preparation i know he not show everything the same like me that's okay it's okay it's process it's more interesting when we do like this
SPEAKER_03: okay i understand so you are saying that yeah he's doing his best but uh yeah it's not true yeah okay let me ask him hello david how are you hello hello good you yeah i'm good yeah thanks hello david hello how is your brother i don't speak russian
SPEAKER_01: Okay, what is this thing? If I speak or not Russian, I say no. Yeah, yeah. What did he say? The thing I asked him, he doesn't speak Russian. What did he say? He said no, he speaks English.
SPEAKER_03: He doesn't speak Russian. Can you ask him? I said that I understand Russian. I don't speak Russian. He understands, but he doesn't speak. Let me take the control. What's he saying, Alex? He's saying, like, I understand Russian. Like, David is asking, like, do you speak Russian? Do you want to talk Russian? No, no, no. They can't, because we need to explain to other people who are Russian as well. And then how am I going to understand if everyone is speaking Russian? Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Anyway, so let's start this way. David, when we talked with you, you said your weight was about 120 kilo and I was just thinking that you would end up 125, but in the recent video you said
SPEAKER_03: somehow you lost weight to 115 kilo and you hope to be ending up 118 kilo. And Alex thinks this is a strategy from your side. Okay, what is the truth? You don't have to say it, but what do you want to say about it?
SPEAKER_00: At the beginning of the game, you said that you wanted to come to the match at 125 kg, but then you said that you lost weight and became about 117 kg. Alex, for example, says that this may be some kind of tactic, and he specifically tells you that you have such a weight. I'm just asking, what really happens?
SPEAKER_01: No, when I started training, I didn't work much. I worked as a coach, and there wasn't much work. And in fact, my weight was already about 122-121 kg. Even now I can go and weigh myself and show how much I weigh. This morning I weighed 115-500 kg. It's just a lot of work, you don't have time to eat a lot. When you get closer to the form, it's hard to keep your weight and eat a lot. It's probably just because of work.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's because of my work. I work as a coach and at first I was like 122 kilograms. But as I had more and more work, I couldn't eat as much as I wanted to. And I just gradually dropped the weight. This morning I was 115. I could even go check right now weight myself. It's probably because I have more and more work as a trainer and I just can't eat as much.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, okay, okay. So he's saying that just because he started training, but he cannot eat as much as he spends energy?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I don't have time. When I eat a lot, my weight increases. When I'm in a calm state, I've never had any problems gaining weight. On the contrary, I tend to be full, and it's easier for me to gain weight than to run. But the fact that I can work a lot, and the workouts are quite intense, voluminous, and due to this, unfortunately, I lose weight. Well, 115-116 kg is a very comfortable weight for me. And there 120 kg is a little too heavy. I understand that I'm getting fat.
SPEAKER_00: So for me, I'm always lenient to gaining weight, especially when I'm relaxed, I eat good, I train. But right now I have a lot of work and I do a lot of volume as well. Like my training is very volume. I just don't eat as much. I can't I don't have that much time. And I think 115 for me is very good because when I'm 120 ish, I get a little bit chubby. You know, I feel heavier on lower weight. I feel better.
SPEAKER_02: So I have a question. It's like the best for David, like how he feel the best shape in 115 or in 100, for example, 18 or 20, he feel even more stronger. What is the best shape and what is his waist with best shape?
SPEAKER_01: Well, 120 is a lot of power, but when you gain 120, even Alex won't let me lie, when you gain a lot of water, agree with Alex, you become more packed. And when you've gained a little weight, removed the water, you become more functional, you become a fighter. Therefore, for women, for wrestling, it's probably more when I weigh 116-117 kg. And so, to gain strength, power,
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Alex doesn't let me lie. He probably agrees as well. When you have more water, and obviously when I'm 120, I'll be a lot stronger as well, probably feel more power. I will just be less athletic, get always pumped, feel the water, feel the weight. And when you're lower, you feel better, you could move better. He just feels like it's easier for him.
SPEAKER_03: On 115. Okay, so he believes that his category is 115. He belongs to that category, but just because he's very, very strong, so he also prefers to compete in heavier category as well, yeah?
SPEAKER_00: Once a year, you can just translate it.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes. But it's interesting. I've been working out all my life and I'm tired. After every competition I talk to Engin and tell him I won't work out anymore. 115 kg. But every time I get offers to work out 105 kg, 105 kg. It's hard to work out. I'm tired. I can't do it physically. I'm not in good shape. So I decided to work out 115 kg. And there was no one to work out 115 kg. But Alex was offered it and I gladly agreed.
SPEAKER_00: Because like always as I compete, I always cut weight and I'm just, I got tired of it. You know, it's physically demanding on me. It's very hard. And every time after competition, I come to you, I say, Engin, it's the last time, it's the last time I want to cut. But every time it's 105, 105. But I wanted 115, but there isn't really matches, but Alex offered. So I agree, you know, it's a good match too. It's just interesting to go higher. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And how about you, Alex? How is your shape? For me it's impossible to go to 115. No, no, I'm asking your shape. No, that's not what I'm asking. I'm asking how about you? How is your shape? So shape is pretty good now. Like we speak with you before that I put some personal records in some like my favorite exercise. It's pretty good.
SPEAKER_02: Now I also want to be not only powerful but also very fast because I believe it will be very important in the day of the match. Like I said before, before David enjoyed our conversations,
SPEAKER_03: uh david main's weapon i believe it's not only strength but his uh speed because he's very fast after ready go okay should we say speed or like like yeah like yeah reaching the max power like yeah yeah and he is yeah i think yeah you understand what is wrong but you are saying that he is more on the like uh reaching the
SPEAKER_02: Like highest level, max power, very quick. Because I don't think he's... Morozo, he was able to go like flash pin and Morozo even was able to turn in in 100% because he was like flash pin and that's it. And a lot of guys like Silaev also was the same situation. He was very explosive on the after ready goal.
SPEAKER_03: And he's actually very good on set-up. He feels where he needs to be to be explosive, because it's also about the position on the set-up. So are you saying that your challenge this time, like last time your challenge was with Morozov, it was more like an endurance game, but your challenge will be more like who is going to get the control at the start against David?
SPEAKER_02: I believe yes. I believe David is more explosive than everyone else. Even with Morozov, I believe David is more explosive. Yeah, yeah, Morozov is not explosive at all, my friend. Morozov usually stops people here. Yeah, it's true, it's true. If he stops, it's like very special. David is also very powerful, but he's able to win with the guys, with his opponent, like, you know, very fastly. You know, 0-0 one second, for example.
SPEAKER_03: that bit. And it's neat that you don't need to sleep with David. It's impossible to sleep with him. Okay, so you are basically saying that as long as you get to start faster or as long as
SPEAKER_03: you stop him you will be stronger this is what you believe i i believe that for viewers it will be more interesting if we start to pull not like a flash pin but in full power you know so you are just saying if i would hold your hands like this they already go and then you started i take my okay i understand maybe it is translated with alexis
SPEAKER_00: Yes, Engi asked us about Alex's form. He said that he won't be able to play in 115. He sees that you are strong, but you have a big advantage because you are a starter. You start very hard from the start and you beat a lot of guys like Silaev and Morozov. For example, you didn't let Morozov just turn on so that he could go in normally.
SPEAKER_00: Do you agree? Love it?
SPEAKER_01: So it's more of a match on speed, who will take it from the start and get into their position. Yes, I understand. Do you agree with this? You see this match the same way as who starts first? Well, of course, Alex has big hands. If Alex manages to get into the place where he wants, well, my hands are shorter, smaller, his paw is so healthy.
SPEAKER_01: If he takes the first phase, of course, it will be almost unrealistic to pull him out of there. Yes, who is faster and has more time, then the advantage will be in that direction, but I can't say for sure how it will happen. It's not clear how strong he is. I've never stood with him, I can't imagine his level of strength.
SPEAKER_00: I agree that it's speedwise because Alex got a big hand, big lever. And if he gets in his position and he wins the first phase of the goal, it's going to be basically impossible to drag him back out. I agree that it's probably speedwise. And for power, I can't really say because I never pulled with Alex. So I'm not so sure. I can't really see how close they are in power.
SPEAKER_00: As far as I know, Alex is not a starter.
SPEAKER_01: So he thinks Alex is more of a strength puller, like on the longer matches, he's not as explosive of the goal?
SPEAKER_03: If you were talking about right arm, I would just say that he is more of an explosiveness, not for a long match in my opinion. For left arm, he is explosive as well.
SPEAKER_03: Morozov barely stopped him, and he could also pull shoulder pressure, hook, side, toproll. I think Alex can do everything with left arm. I rank Alex's left a little bit higher than his right, but he would know himself better. I think Alex starts well on the left, he can fight everywhere, he went into the shoulder with Morozov, into the hook. I think his left is a little bit higher than his right, but Alex will know better.
SPEAKER_01: David, do you also think that your left is better than your right? Or how do you think your right and left? Same? Between your left and your right, how do you see it? Maybe the left is stronger or maybe they are the same? Well, before the break, I broke my hand twice, both with Morozov and with Prudnik. Before the break, I would say that the left is 20-30% stronger than 100%.
SPEAKER_01: At the moment, my left hand is stronger, but they're probably the same. But my left hand, I'm left-handed, I've been taught that. And I feel my left hand much better, even during the grip, I feel more confident.
SPEAKER_00: like before the injury against prudnik and morozov when i broke my arm i would say it's 20 to 30 stronger for sure i'm a left-handed so i it's stronger as well right now it's probably a bit stronger and i feel it better no because because i'm left-handed i feel the better the setup the technique everything it it listens to me more basically with left arm yeah
SPEAKER_03: And another question for David. David, you say that you feel better at 115 kg than 105. And obviously you are strong enough to pull in super heavyweight category, but you are not really super heavyweight by the weight. So if you just say that, I mean, it doesn't matter you win or lose at 115 kg.
SPEAKER_03: Like who do you think would be a good match for you? If everyone is ready. Like no injury, nobody has injury, nobody has illness or nothing, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, you say that 115 kg is a good category for you. If you look at the strength, you can go out in superweights and fight them. Just in terms of weight, you are not exactly like they are, 140 kg and so on. If you have a match at 115 kg, against whom you see that it will be a good match, everyone will be ready, without injuries, without anything. Who would you choose? Who do you see as a good opponent? Well, God willing, that all this will pass without injuries. I just get injuries so often lately.
SPEAKER_00: I hope I don't get any injuries because the last moments I get a lot of injuries, so I'm getting a bit scared, you know. But when it comes to 115, I think it's either Alizhan or Ivan. Because who else? How about Devon left arm? It's Devon on my left.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think? Ask him why he is laughing. Why are you laughing? I don't know. Devon is such a character that I am very respectful to him as a athlete, but since he behaves like that, I don't understand where I grew up, where I grew up.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not going to swallow it, and I don't really want to go to jail because of the competition. So if the organizers are ready to help me, I definitely won't sit down. Let's do it, I don't mind. But the dirt that he makes, I definitely won't eat it.
SPEAKER_00: Devon as an athlete I have great respect for him but he's such a character the stuff that he does I don't really understand it probably because the way I was raised and where I live I wouldn't swallow all of it you know I wouldn't get it and I don't want to get in jail so if organizers can guarantee that I won't go to jail I would consider but what he does in the matches I wouldn't take it in
SPEAKER_01: I have a very good relationship with Devin. We communicate well, we see each other, we respect each other, we greet each other. Except for respect, there is nothing. But when he starts a fight with someone, it's as if he has some kind of wedge, and he starts to make this mess. That's why I'm ready. Why would I be afraid? I'm ready for anything.
SPEAKER_00: Like, why not? I'm ready for anyone. And for Devin, we have a great relationship. I always say hi to him. We talk. We talk great. But when a match is set, it's like Devin gets a switch in his hand and it's completely different. All the dirt starts coming out. You know, but overall, yeah. Why not? Okay. Okay. I understand. I understand. Okay. And Alec,
SPEAKER_03: Just say that you are not coming here to lose, you are coming to win, and David is also coming to win. Just say that you won, as you are playing right now. What do you think that should be next for you? You know, firstly, I need to concentrate on this match, yeah? Because it's always like this, we need to respect opponents. David is a great opponent, and now I need to concentrate only on this match.
SPEAKER_02: after like always the goal the same for me for me on the left goal is number one number one so it's not what do you think that is going to be number one after tv7 you know in my opinion no you know my opinion pretty good no i don't if we have two athletes uh and uh one athletes
SPEAKER_02: can be very uncomfortable for second athlete. If second athletes do the very good homework and do plan B, not just trying to think about the wrist, but about floor press, about side, about everything, it can be interesting match. If it will be the same plan like for the right, the result will be the same like for the right match. And do you think that Artem has all that
SPEAKER_02: plans and capabilities to do different things? He's a very talented guy. Also, he has a very good coach, Getalo, which is one of the best coaches. He understands Armwrestling pretty well. He had the same coach in the last match. But he was right. They have more time now because I believe that they know, like all last months, they understand that this match needs to happen. And I believe that they choose the date
SPEAKER_02: when Artem will be ready. So I believe he will be in the best shape ever. In this, I believe, I really want to see a good match because for me, if it will be the same preparation like in the right, it will be the same result. But I want to see an interesting match. That's why I believe and I want to believe that it was something absolutely different by the trainings, by the preparation.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think that Morozov right now looks very big and prepared? Yeah, yeah, he's for sure, because they choose the date when he will be in the best shape ever, because they choose. They say, for example, when somebody asked earlier, yeah, they say it's not now, let's do later. And they know how much time they need for this. And they like a team very professional.
SPEAKER_02: do very good preparation. I believe that it will be the best Artem's shape. But what exactly the shape? Yeah, this is the question. I don't know. Because they don't show too much. Okay. And David,
SPEAKER_03: I know you are friends with Artyom Morozov. Do you follow him? Do you see his progress? He is probably over 140 kg now. Do you think he will come there with his best ever shape? You and Artyom are friends, right? Do you follow him? Do you see his progress? He is over 140 kg now. Do you think he will be in his best shape when he comes to Tbilisi?
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so. I've never seen him so big. Artyom understands the responsibility of this training. He doesn't have the right to lose to Vitaly. The right goal didn't work out.
SPEAKER_01: It should be such a big victory. Therefore, it seems to me that Artyom stood out 100% like never before. Therefore, it seems to me that he will be in better shape if nothing gets in the way before the preparation. He really became so huge.
SPEAKER_00: Like, he's so big. I've never seen him like this. And I feel like he knows the responsibility he has on this match because he lost the right. And he has to win the left because it's going to be a big win as well. And it's a big responsibility. It's a big match. And I believe that if anything, nothing goes wrong before the match, I think it's going to be a crazy shape. He's so big. He's very strong. It's definitely going to be the best shape.
SPEAKER_01: And does he think that Artem is going to win, or is he underdog? It's hard to say. 50-50. It's hard to say. It's a situation where you don't want to beat anyone. But I can't say for sure.
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to answer, so I don't get wrong with any of them. So I'd say it's 50-50. It's very tough. It's very tough to say. So he thinks that Artem has a chance? Yes, yes, yes. Artem has a good left hand, but I have a different left hand. His left is very good. It's like a different, you know, it's different. And Alex, how do you see, like, who has how much chance about this one?
SPEAKER_02: Honestly, I really don't want to make prediction. I like so much both of guys. They are really top. And, you know, because of Artem, when we need to say truth, yeah, all of us was somewhere and Artem make the seven matches. Yeah. So he probably did so great job, you know, like one match, second match and seven or I don't remember how exactly. Eight, I think. Eight. So all the time. You mean that he won eight times? Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So he, like, all the time was there, yeah? It's not any questions to him about his level. And, you know, sometimes, for example, even not in the best shape, but he still go to the match. Something hurt in his elbow, he still go to the match. Like, he never was going out all the time. And honestly, I know the power of Vitaly pretty good.
SPEAKER_02: we i mean you know as an experience or you are just seeing it yeah okay like we was you know we was i know his potential i know his uh hand really good i know his power you ever even trained with him yes yeah we train we have even video of our sparring session and i know he how special he is and now he even gained some more weight because previously about gained weight he was saying
SPEAKER_02: Sometimes it was like hard to him, but now he gained weight. So it was like what he won, he did. Like always in the past, he says that sometimes he needs to do more like base workout exercise to gain weight, like to be bigger by waist. And now I see that he was able to do what he want and he still have his explosiveness. And that's why
SPEAKER_03: He's a very, very special guy. He was always, always in the top three, at least always. Even when both were pulling at WAF, both him and Lewand, they had a match at Zloty. And he gave a good one, you know, like he came here. I remember, yes. And I think you were there as well. I've been there, yes. And from there, you know, Lewand won, yes, but he gave him some damage in those years.
SPEAKER_02: Levan's left arm was ahead of his right arm, yeah. So, La Lettine, yes, for sure, you know. With Vitaly, to make pressure on him, you need just be as much tall as him and possibly as much strong in the wrist. Or you need to change your style. I mean, change style. For example, if Vitaly is stronger on the wrist, so you need to not concentrate too much on the wrist.
SPEAKER_02: but concentrate on something else, which is possibly for you to want with him. And this probably can be the key. And I think that Artem will maybe understand this, because, you know, for sure they understand. Yeah, I mean, all the team of Artem. And they prepare something. For example, it will be not like if plan A don't work, they don't change nothing. I think they have at least plan B for everything, you know, maybe even plan C.
SPEAKER_02: And how do you see your chances against Vitaly? You need to ask him because I remember he says he has no problem. So, okay. We will see with the time. We will see. Why do I need to ask him? Right now I'm talking with you. I will ask him as well. Don't worry about it. In the last interview, he said it's absolutely okay. He doesn't feel any danger. I heard from him. Okay. So, I asked him and you heard about it. And your response is?
SPEAKER_02: Then let's go. I say, yeah, not be too sure. Not be too sure. Yes, you are strong, Vitaly, but everyone else also go in the same place. Did you say that he's strongest? I said that he believe he is the strongest, but everyone else going in the same aim, in the same goal. Okay. So there are other people that believe that they are strongest as well, you know? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, okay. So you are thinking he's kind of too confident? Probably yes. And you know, sometimes it's a problem because he's really talented, he's powerful, but confidence sometimes helps you. Sometimes you can be surprised. Why would confidence have negative effects on you? Is it because you get relaxed and you don't do what is necessary for the training?
SPEAKER_02: If somebody too confident, yeah, he thinks it's already enough. It's not need to do something more. It's first of all, and second, sometimes
SPEAKER_02: Also on myself, I can say. If I'm too confident, for example, I don't work too much on plan B or plan C, and if it doesn't work, you don't have other options. If you are really, really serious and concentrated, you prepare some other options. Did you recently have such experience on yourself?
SPEAKER_03: For sure, on the right hand. On the right hand against Jerry, right? But listen, that happened to all of us, you know. Anyway, so let's continue. Oh, David, you said that if we guarantee you that you are not going to jail, you would pull Devin. Just say that nothing happened in that way. As in, like, arm wrestling perspective, how do you think the match would go with left arm, with Devin and you?
SPEAKER_00: You joked that if you guarantee that you won't go to jail, then we'll fight. If you throw away all these games before the match, when he's already at the table, you'll fight him on the left. How do you see this match? How will he fight him? I'm not kidding. Who said I was kidding? I say, where did I grow up? What insults does he make to his opponents? I say, I'm not kidding. I'm ready for a trash talk. I'm ready for the athlete to warm up the fight.
SPEAKER_01: I understand that it's part of the game. You have to sell tickets, you have to sell... You see, Alex doesn't do dirty things. I don't do that. But if it's interesting, I treat him with the utmost respect. And Devin does the same. But when there is an insult, not a warm-up, but an insult, I speak with all my heart and declare that I won't wait for it. It will lead to something bigger. And...
SPEAKER_01: Obviously, I think that any person who respects himself doesn't want to be insulted. That's why I say it's not a joke. I'm not ready to accept insults in my place. I don't respect him. If this person changes, it won't be possible. And to fight Devon... Devon is a very experienced athlete in terms of wrestling. He is the most experienced athlete. Naturally, it will be as difficult for him to fight.
SPEAKER_01: I lost to Kamil Yablonsky, and this technique is very peculiar. And with him, of course, there will be a difficult control of the wrist and all that. It's a peculiar technique. With Dorn in good shape, I also see that there will be a good fight, I will also fight him well. And I would be happy to fight him.
SPEAKER_00: I would do it gladly. I think he's very experienced, basically as experienced as an athlete gets. And for all this time, basically, his only loss is Kamil. And that, I believe, is more of a stylistic issue, as Kamil's technique is very specific, you know? In fact, Devin hasn't really pulled a lot of left-arm matches yet. Yeah, when he said that all he lost is, I think he beat Sandris.
SPEAKER_03: and he had a win against leonidas and i don't remember lately if he has another left arm match maybe kalinchenko maybe left time people yeah yeah yeah but i wouldn't consider kalinchenko left arm because he broke his arm some time ago yeah okay sorry about alex go ahead and he said about the the jail thing i i said i'm serious you know because i i wouldn't take it
SPEAKER_00: i see it as a serious issue that i get trash talk i get making the match the match hard and people making ears but he he crosses the line too much there there is making a match hot and then there's insulting and i believe he crosses the line he actively insults his opponent i don't think it's right you know i don't think it should be that way
SPEAKER_00: I'm ready to fight. I hope I won't get injured. I'm ready to fight him too. In 1.15, yeah. In 1.15, I would gladly pull him. After this is done, I hope no injuries, nothing. And if I'm good, I will gladly pull him. I'll be very happy to do it.
SPEAKER_03: Is it in 115? He asked if it's in 115. Yeah, if I set them, I will set them in 115 because they bought actually that category. Yeah, they will sometimes get heavy, but they won't just
SPEAKER_00: And David, I remember you
SPEAKER_01: You have a tattoo of the Olympics, right? You were a judo? You were a judo athlete? Yes, I was in the national team. I studied in the Olympic reserve college. I was in the national team. I was a professional.
SPEAKER_00: was in a national team in the in the camp like getting ready and i was professionally training you know being serious in 81 kilograms his weight category he was number one number one in his his nation uh yeah in his country yeah in his country has he competed international
SPEAKER_01: Did you compete nationally? I competed in the International Cup, in Europe. I even competed twice for Georgia. There was a national competition for judo. There were 81 categories of athletes. They invited me from Georgia. I represented Georgia. I did it for more than 10 years. I threw my whole life into judo because I got injured and couldn't fight anymore.
SPEAKER_00: I always did it for like 10 years I was training and I pulled out because I had a serious injury and for competitions I had a couple like Europe international competitions and twice I actually was representing Georgia because they didn't have athletes and I was called and I represented Georgia a couple of times.
SPEAKER_03: So I used to train very young kids. When I say young kids, like 12, 13 years old, not so young, but the ones that came from wrestling,
SPEAKER_03: And they were already ahead of the other guys that were coming to train. And I believe that it is the same for judo that you all the time pull. That is why his hand and pulling is very strong because of having a judo base.
SPEAKER_00: When I was training kids in 12-13 years old, I always noticed that the kids who come from judo, they are a priori stronger than the rest. And do you think it's the same for you because of judo, that the hands, the wrist, the rolling, it's stronger and somehow helped you too?
SPEAKER_01: Of course, we had three training sessions a day. During the training sessions, we had three training sessions for 14 days. After the training sessions, there were two training sessions. Honestly, I can't imagine how I endured it all, but it worked out. And there were elementary training sessions, if you look at the usual rubber band that is there. There was a belt for this usual kimono.
SPEAKER_01: And we just pulled ourselves together a thousand times, five hundred times. And there was a crazy endurance. It was the wrist, the fingers, they were just stone. And the main thing was that, for example, five fights, five minutes of wrestling, you have a minute of rest. During this time of rest, you had to go up the rope twice.
SPEAKER_01: This is your rest. And then the next fight. I always fought with the guys there. When you quit armwrestling, I was not very technical. But due to these workouts, what I did during judo, fingers, wrists, they were very strong. But I didn't understand why. Now I look back and understand that all these workouts gave me the ropes and the grip of judo, which I kept in statics all the time.
SPEAKER_00: When I got into armwrestling after living judo, my fingers and wrists were almost like very strong and I couldn't understand why. When I look back now, I get it because we had insane training camps like for 14 days every day, like three trainings a day.
SPEAKER_00: every day and I don't know how I endured it because we had crazy you go out you fight for five minutes then you rest for one minute and your rest was you got on a on a cable and pulling up and down twice and that was your rest you were climbing then going fighting then climbing again and we were getting rubber bands and judo belt grabbing it and uh like pulling it towards you like a thousand times uh 500 times and it was like crazy amount of endurance
SPEAKER_03: and overall athleticism you know and i feel the the fingers and wrists were yeah he's very very strong yeah very very strong he's saying yeah for sure yeah guys are asking why i shaved my head guys i had one year ago the hair transplant you know uh
SPEAKER_03: and then for one year normally i like at least twice a year i shave my head but after the transplantation these people said the guy who did it said that you know i will see the full results in one year
SPEAKER_03: So I didn't shave my head for one year. So after one year finished, so I finally shaved because I saw the final results. So that is what I do about twice a year. For sure I did now, and then I will do for sure one more, probably beginning of summer. In fact, I like short hair better, yeah. Anyway, so Alex,
SPEAKER_03: When I asked questions on the community page, the majority of the people said that this card is the best card ever. Your match with David is, for me, an incredible match. David is someone who did a match with Morozov and he was very, very close. You are someone who was also head-to-head with Morozov.
SPEAKER_03: a world title match and you both were very close to the champion and now you guys are pulling so this event is like very high level but there are still some other matches that like that in this event alone there could be five main event matches you know like and and and then
SPEAKER_03: The atmosphere in Georgia, I think, will be crazy. And there are some matches very high level about the tense, like Gennady versus Devon, if you are following, you know. Yeah, it started out like Joe, but now it looks like Gennady's
SPEAKER_03: That's how it looks, you know. And then we know how important Hermes versus Michael match because the winner is going to pull the king. And that's very, very important. You know, like for Michael, like Michael is so close to his like dream to pull against
SPEAKER_03: So he's 51 years. I'm not saying that he won't have another chance if he loses or something. But right now he's that close and probably he doesn't want to miss that opportunity. While Hermes was the closest guy, looks like, to Levan. And he wants to pull him one more time again. So that match is also very important. Morozov versus Laletin match. Morozov is undefeated.
SPEAKER_03: And a lot of people think that Laletin is the number one guy unofficially. So we will find out that one. Morozov doesn't talk. Last time Morozov talked a lot. But this time he prefers not to talk so much. But the only thing he's doing just every time I see him is...
SPEAKER_03: you know, getting bigger and bigger. We have Tatachinks versus Irakli match. That's another incredible match. I don't know if you saw, you are seeing those messages to each other and Malin, Fia and some other matches. So it's just incredible events. We already sold tickets more than any event that ticket sale was finalized, but we already, we still have three weeks and the more tickets sold and it will probably
SPEAKER_03: possibly maybe not double of the best event so far about the spectators but it is going to that direction so what do you think about this event do you think that it will be tense with the those those georgian spectators you know like before the we start i already was saying that it's insane it's hard to imagine uh
SPEAKER_02: In the past, it was hard to imagine that this card will be possible. And now we have this card. So it's like, I believe, dream card. And the matches are so equal. You know, some matches you really don't have idea how it will be. But, you know, already it will be so fantastically interesting match. And Georgians, you know, we have Georgia. It's a country of our Unwrestling King. So for sure there will be
SPEAKER_02: electrifying atmosphere very very special atmosphere and those are hot-blooded people you understand some people some nations are cold-blooded it's nothing good or bad but some people are really like uh and georgians are yeah yeah so i believe we will feel that atmosphere we will see and we will feel that atmosphere there so yeah honestly like i said before i believe this is the best card ever so
SPEAKER_02: It's the greatest number of potential. For me, like a viewer, I imagine if I sit somewhere there in the direction of the stage, I'm like a kid. I feel myself. Me too. I'm 15 years old, but I'm a kid. Every time I'm in a candy store, kid, I'm organizing everything, I'm stressed out.
SPEAKER_03: Like I said this many times, like there are moments like Alex, you know, those moments that Ivan Matushenko and Ali Can, they go and then they lock at the centre, they stay. Yeah. You know, just I was that close and I was like, wow, I love it. Remember, remember match of Devon and Levan first round? Yes, the same thing, same thing. Five metres from the stage. Yeah, yes, same thing. And you talked it.
SPEAKER_03: stop, time stopped there, because there was nothing moving. And then, you know, the hungry guy back there is like this. Yeah, it was just like, you know, I was like, is it real? Is it real? You know, like, we have those moments. And I think all together, we are right in history.
SPEAKER_02: athletes, fans, all together we are doing a great job. I want to really say thank you and your team and Robert and you and all the guys who are in the team because you make our wrestling dreams true.
SPEAKER_02: And it's fantastic that we see that armwrestling is growing and even better times is going. So thank you so much for this. Really, like a fan of armwrestling. All together we are, dude. All together. All together we are, dude.
SPEAKER_03: uh my friend uh somebody wrote that your ticket sale doesn't matter yeah ticket sales matters my friend i mean every country has like the buying power do you understand what it means like maybe there are tickets thirty dollars but there is also sixty dollar ticket there is also hundred dollar tickets so when you sell thirty dollars though those are the probably the ones that are
SPEAKER_03: What do you think about the card? Did you like it?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, there are a lot of stars, a lot of stars. I'll be most interested in Krikvinia vs. Larratt. This match, like the last time, they set the competition on fire. Now I'm also interested, especially in Georgia, in my homeland, Krikvinia will fight. It will be, I think, very cool, very.
SPEAKER_01: I want to see Toda with RMS, they also had a rematch, they fought together. And I like very cool fights. Alex Kordachev will fight there, I will follow him.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's a great card. A lot of stars like Gennady and Devin. It's a rematch. First time they they made the show on fire. So this time I think it's going to be the same. It's going to be very interesting because Gennady is pulling in Georgia as well. It's going to be twice as hot, basically. Alex Kordesha is pulling as well. I'm going to be watching him. Ermes and Michael Todd as well. It's kind of a rematch because they pulled before. It's a great card, you know.
SPEAKER_03: i'm very excited okay what does david think about alex kurdecha and his opponents match
SPEAKER_01: His opponent is crazy ready for 100% fired up like insane. So I bet organizers should pay attention to his opponent. But I will root for Alex.
SPEAKER_03: Alex has an opponent. Do you know how his training is going?
SPEAKER_03: I will cheer for Alex, but I will put all my money on Alex. Very good training. I will root for Alex, but I will bet all my money on his opponent because he is going to win. How about the opposite question, Alex? Do you know David's opponent? What do you think about his chances against David?
SPEAKER_02: You know, David's opponent is a very nice guy, beautiful, friendly, very good guy, you know. But David also, you know, David have fantastic smile, David have... David only smiles. You know, David can defeat his opponent by smile, you know, honestly. David can defeat his opponent by smile because he is, you know, so...
SPEAKER_02: so uh nice and uh also he's so fastly like you know he is like explosion on the start and uh without david armwrestling will be not the same david armwrestling
SPEAKER_03: Why should it be negative? Just smile, let's get out, let's arm wrestle, have fun. Yeah, yeah. I agree. Okay, Dino saying that Engin arranged a hair transplant for David.
SPEAKER_01: He says, we'll arrange a hair transplant. Even when I had hair, I was very short with them. For some reason, I didn't like it all the time. Here in Russia, too, they offered to do something for free, but refused. I don't know, maybe now I've seen Engin's hairstyle, it's better, maybe I'll do it too.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, even when I had hair, I always cut it short. I don't know, I like it this way. I get offers in Russia to make it for free, but I deny it. But when I saw you, Engin, I'm changing my mind. Maybe I should do it, you know?
SPEAKER_03: Anyways, I think Denis Ciplenko is going to have a hair transplantation soon, very soon. I just saw Denis' video and he says like, oh, organizers, I need a match. And now he puts East versus West logo. So it shows, you know, what he means. And then we wrote to each other and says, Engin, you are the only guy that I'm going to.
SPEAKER_03: compete for he says and then let's see let's see he comes back and uh see who he will be uh pulling again so let's go some matches david let's start from you um um
SPEAKER_02: I agree also, because Bacho, I know his level, he was on Artified Factory, and I believe his previous match was just, he was like, it was his probably opponent was more experienced because it was Reino, you know. And we saw his opponent just won the world title at this heavyweight category, so it just shows how good Bacho. Yeah, yeah. But Bacho now, you know, Bacho in Georgia, so...
SPEAKER_03: I believe Bacho will be in very, very good shape. But it's very hard to underestimate Brett Grundy, who beat Pat Mask, who beat Paulo. These two guys are very, very strong guys. So you both think that Bacho is going to win. David, Vasily Davutashvili vs. Stoyan Golemanov.
SPEAKER_00: Vasily? Vasily is in good shape now. He's gained a lot of weight. I saw it. I talked to him in Turkey. He says he's ready. He's in good shape. I think he'll win. He's an experienced athlete. He's experienced athlete. And I see when I talk to him. I saw him in Turkey. I could tell that he's getting bigger and better shape. And I could tell that he looks strong right now. I think he's going to win. He's going to win. Okay. And you, Alex?
SPEAKER_02: For me, I think it will be a close match because Stojan is also a very special guy. He knows how to pull. But I put Vasily as a slight favorite because now he has a special motivation. Because it's your home country, so you will do more than always. And this will motivate Vasily, in my opinion. Okay, and let's go to another match.
SPEAKER_03: Touching Seracli. No, no, no. Later. Later. Later, later. Yeah. And let's go to Malin Bergstrom Fia. Malin and Fia Rasek. I don't even know who they are. I don't know. I don't know who they are. I didn't follow anything. I don't know who they are.
SPEAKER_03: I don't follow them. No, I'm not sure, so I can't really make a prediction. Okay, and you, Alex? Both goals are fantastic. Tell me, Malin goes under in a category which is a little bit lower than always, yes? They go 70 kilos. They both will be 70 kilos. Malin is losing weight, but Malin used to pull, like Malin in 2018 won 65 kilos of goals.
SPEAKER_03: And this will be in 70 kilos. I was thinking when she loses weight, she will lose size. But when I see her arm and then together with Fia, she has like one and a half kilos left, but she's still very big. And last time they pulled in America WAL, Malin beat Fia. But it doesn't mean that she's going to beat now, but both are incredible. Right now, Fia is in incredible shape. Malin last year won.
SPEAKER_02: Europeans in 80 kilo in Slovakia, dominant fashion. So I really don't know who's going to win that one. You know, both girls are fantastic, really fantastic. I know pretty good the styles. And I would say the win will be friendship. But my support going to Malin, you know, because I just support her a little bit more. But I support both, but a little bit more for Malin.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, okay, okay. And so let's start with now Daniel Prokopchuk versus Oleg Dzhok. With David. I think Oleg Dzhok will win. I think Daniel jumped over his head a little bit.
SPEAKER_00: I think he will win because Daniel is stepping a bit above his head. I think he is very strong in his weight and he is big. I think he is going to win. Dominant is this? Yes. And you, Alex?
SPEAKER_02: You know, the previous match was maybe unexpected for Oleg, because Bitkili is a fantastic guy. He's a high-hanging category guy. Yeah, and if I need to see and analyse Bitkili's match versus Artem, his wrist was unbelievable.
SPEAKER_02: And he was also, you know, after the match, we all know that Bedkili is so special. And when Bedkili was pulled with Oleg, it also shows that he finds all possible positions to stop his opponents. And he finds it. And it wasn't easy. First round, Bedkili was top match. Later, Oleg got exhausted.
SPEAKER_02: And I need to be honest with you, I think that Kili's level of the power is bigger than Daniil. If they were the same weight, it would be close, but there is a weight difference. On the paper, it looks that way, but like Daniil says... I think it can be interesting, but for me, if I need to compare the base of the statistic, it's Oleg.
SPEAKER_03: On the paper, when you look at it this way, in my opinion, Daniel and Badkili, same weight would be an incredible match. Badkili used to be very good in the lighter weight category. But right now he is 95 kilos, while Daniel will probably come there 81-82 kilos.
SPEAKER_03: I think as far as I remember, he said he was 87, maybe 88, but I remember him over 89 kilos, 89 and a half or something, Oleg. And I was surprised. I have the scale photos, but now I cannot find probably. So Zouk is losing, just say, four kilos.
SPEAKER_03: like compared to his match against Batkili. And I don't know how much it's going to affect. Yeah, on the paper, it should look like Zorc's favorite. But whenever, like when Daniel went to AMC event, I thought that Alonsole would be a little bit favorite, like 55-45. For me, I agree with you. I agree. And then he just beat, he just beat.
SPEAKER_03: It wasn't really hard. It's very hard to underestimate someone dangerous. I agree totally with you. For me, even Alan was not slight but a real favourite and Daniel beat him.
SPEAKER_02: Not even his favourite move, but he beat him. Before that, Taras Taisdis beat Daniel. I think some unbelievable things happened in that category. Daniel is also not someone to underestimate. He's also great.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so you are saying that Zog is also a favorite? Yeah. Okay, Frank Lamparelli vs. Sergei Kalinchenko, David. Is it the right hand? Yes, the right hand is 115. It's 115, right? Yeah, 115. Yes, the right hand is 115. Well, I probably wanted Kalinchenko to win.
SPEAKER_01: I don't even know whether to raise this topic or not. I recently read how Lamparelli said that he is such a pure athlete, he has become nothing. It's a little funny. I would like Kalinchenko to win, but Lamparelli will probably win. The right hand is good. But the fact that he is such a fool is a fact.
SPEAKER_00: I think I want Kalinchenko to win but it probably gonna be Frank and recently I heard that Frank saying that oh I'm I'm clean athlete I don't use anything and I think he's lying a little bit you know I think he's I don't know how to properly say it it's all he believes that
SPEAKER_00: Lately he went to the dark side. This is what Dadikin is saying. So he thinks that Frank is going to win. If Frank wins, can David beat Frank?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. He's a super clean athlete. I don't know where he is. I don't know. He's so clean, right? He's a clean athlete, so I don't know. I'm honestly not so sure about my right hand. Because when I got injured, when Egypt offered me to fight on the right, I had no choice. That's why I fought. But I don't really want to fight on the right hand. I want to pull my left hand more.
SPEAKER_00: Like I don't really feel comfortable and you know, I don't really like pulling with my right arm because of the injury lately and I've just been pulling because you asked me to yeah, yeah, I would prefer pulling left arm, you know, I don't Okay, but does he think that when does he expect six months one year right arm? Well, do you have any expectations? Six months, a year to the right? Well, I'm training now. Denis has already started training. It's already the second week.
SPEAKER_01: Like Denis started training recently and I hope that I'm gonna have training with him, I'm gonna pull him a lot and I'll get better and better. This is what I hoped. And then he will let me know.
SPEAKER_03: And Alex, how do you see this match? Serhii versus Frank? I feel like always just thinking like, okay, Serhii is from here. Alex, you're going to become a politician, right? Someday.
SPEAKER_02: You know I have support of the team of the East, but I need to be objective, I need to be honest. So, Sergi now going a little bit under his category. Before he was heavier, now he goes under. If he will be the same power, you know, I saw his match with Strelkov. That shape is pretty, pretty good, pretty good.
SPEAKER_02: So Teche would win, but if he loses so much power, then he may lose? It's possible, yeah. It's possible. But according to what I see in social media, that he's sharp, he will be more faster, more durable. The only thing which I'm afraid of is his wrist, but I know that he will be trained
SPEAKER_02: very good about this because Frank's wrist is very special. So if Frank takes his wrist, do you think that he can win this way as well? I think yes. I think he understands that it needs to be trained. And Sergei in the training process is very, very patient, very disciplined. He lives by arm wrestling now. For me, really, I support Sergei. It's like what I support by my heart.
SPEAKER_02: It's really 50-50 match because I don't know the level now. It's changed or it's the same like with Svetkov. If it's the same, I put Sergei like a favorite. But if it's changed, I don't know what exactly the level because he changed his body weight, you know. Petrenko versus Oniani. Petrenko versus Oniani, on the left. 95 kilos. 95.
SPEAKER_01: If weightlifting doesn't affect Petrenko, I think Petrenko will win. Petrenko is one of those guys who gave Alizhan such a good fight. He's probably one of the only ones who hooked Alizhan, even better than Matyushenko. So, in my opinion, if everything goes well for him, weightlifting doesn't affect him,
SPEAKER_01: Most likely, he is a little ahead of Onyanya in strength. Because if you look at how Onyanya fought with Dzhokha, I am more than sure that Petrenko will beat Dzhokha much more confidently. In general, I think that Petrenko will win if everything goes well for him.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's going to be Petrenko. If his weight cut doesn't get interrupted, you know, I think everything goes fine. I think he's going to win because he is basically one of the only guys that stopped Alijan and gave him a great fight. And I think actually he gave a better fight than Ivan did.
SPEAKER_00: And if we go by Jacques, Betkely pulled Jacques and he had some troubles. And I think Petrenko pulls Jacques easily, at least easier than Betkely. And if weight cut goes good, I think he's going to be stronger than Betkely. Do you think that Betkely had trouble with Oleg because of...
SPEAKER_03: Oleg's abnormal hand or is it because of the power? If it is the power, then how close does it think the power is?
SPEAKER_00: When BitKill and Zhokh were fighting, do you think it was because of strength or because of Zhokh's hands? If it was because of strength, how close were they? I think it was because of the inconvenience. When I fought with Zhokh, I had big hands, but Zhokh's inconvenience...
SPEAKER_01: It's a completely different hand. He doesn't have this part, he doesn't have any softness at all. He has a bone there, and it's just very uncomfortable. It seems to me that it's partly because he opened his wrist, but his fingers weren't ready to hold it all. It seems to me that it was more uncomfortable there.
SPEAKER_00: I think it was more of Betekele being uncomfortable because I myself, I gripped up big hands, but Jacques is completely different. You know, it's crazy. Like this part, it's like it doesn't have anything soft in there. It's like a bone. And I think maybe because it was too uncomfortable and his fingers and wrists weren't ready to contain Jacques' wrist. And Alex, how do you see this match?
SPEAKER_02: You know, I see Petrenko like a favorite and not just because I like him, but I really see his power. I know the results of the sparring with Oleg. I know the level of his preparation now. And if he don't do any mistakes on the setup or during the fight, it will be Oleg's line. He will be, you know, he's really, really strong, honestly.
SPEAKER_02: He's really strong. I believe that not too many people know the real level of Oleg Petrenko's power.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he lost against Devin because Devin made the weight on the scale, but Devin, in fact, belongs to super heavyweight category. His power is not that level. His power is like different level. So Petrenko didn't pull the super heavyweight level, Devin, but Petrenko probably pulled heavyweight level of Devin. Yeah, because Devin knows how to cut weight and
SPEAKER_03: Even one round when Devin took the wrist, when he wanted to go, he couldn't go. The next day or two days later, he said, like, Engin, my chest hurts so much. I said, because of that position? He said, yes, it was because he had to do a lot of adjustments to finish. Yeah, because his wrist and hand wasn't near to Devin's hand, but the horsepower was there.
SPEAKER_03: still wasn't enough but it kind of put some short break on on devon you know yeah and you know when you lose weight you usually lose some power from the bigger muscle groups not so much from the end pronation or something not here and when you gain weight just say you are 80 kilo and you reach 100 kilo
SPEAKER_03: I can tell you the power you gain from chest, lats, bicep will be much more than the power you gain for hands. Hand will increase, but not so much. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so you are saying that Petrenko is going to win, and David also thinks Petrenko is going to win. Okay, so you guys are saying that Batkili won two times, and now when he wanted to have the permanent belt,
SPEAKER_03: He's going to be disappointed. This is what you guys are thinking. Okay, let's go. Irakli Zrakashvili versus Tata Sims. David, you have won against both of them. And first of all, do you agree that Irakli got stronger?
SPEAKER_03: lately or it is because he's in now in different category and that category is not the is not at the level of the heavyweight category do you understand alex the question yeah yeah he stepped down so it's different people yeah yeah yeah is it because the 95 kg category more comfortable more comfortable than 105 or is it because you're actually got
SPEAKER_00: Just one second.
SPEAKER_03: uh this korean pull the guy no i i say only the the truth and that is the truth that everyone knows so you better be careful here or you just don't be uh part of it because you are lowering the iq level of the comment section you korean which and pitch or something whatever you know okay go ahead
SPEAKER_01: I think Irakli was strong and happy back then, but the 105th category wasn't his weight, it was an artificial weight gain. Maybe he didn't control himself well enough. I don't think those guys he's beating now, like Tautiev, Babaev, or someone else, that they're weak.
SPEAKER_01: I think he was more functional in the 95th division. He was very tired. I think we fought with him once or twice. After the second round, I think he just couldn't feel his arm.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's more of because he has more quality and it's less water and excessive weight. I feel like his 105 shape is artificial weight, you know, he's too big. And I don't say like, let's say, Babayev and Dautiev, that they lost against him. I don't say that they did it because they're weak. I feel like Irakli in 95 is very efficient. He's great technically and he has a lot of options, you know.
SPEAKER_00: He's a very good athlete. Because when I pulled him, I felt like after the second round, I felt like he got too pumped and he had no power left. Okay, the question is, the question is, so what does it mean for the Todd Hutchings vs. Irakli match? How does it affect the match against Hutchings? I think Irakli will win against Hutchings. Irakli is very strong, but I think Hutchings will win because the top fighters are very comfortable for Hutchings.
SPEAKER_01: As practice has shown, two or three years ago, when he fought Lara, he also covered him and held him in the same format as Angarbaev. They all hit to the shoulder, he just covers them. And his center, the strongest side, no one took. Why did I manage to win? Not that I'm so strong, I don't know what. He just climbed into my strong side and our strong places coincided.
SPEAKER_01: I was a little bit stronger, so it worked out for me. And I know Irakli, he will also pull up here, and he will cover. If Irakli hadn't come up with something new, I think Hutchings will win in his old scheme, because this part, what he covers with his shoulder, it's very strong.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think Hutchings is going to win because he has more, he has easier time against top rollers, basically. And I feel like Irakli is going to go outside if he didn't change anything. When I pulled with Hutchings, I feel like our strong parts met and I was just better. Against Devin, he did the same as well. When Devin went outside, he got on top of him and he just shoulder pressed him, you know, bring him down and just controlled him here. And I feel like it's going to be the same against Irakli.
SPEAKER_03: What did you say? Against Devon, you said? Yeah, like way back. Talking about the VAL match? Yeah, yeah. Far away. He said that it's all the same. Kid Ruggali as well, Devon, all the time when they go outside... Dusty agreed it. It is very hard to beat Todd without controlling his pronator.
SPEAKER_01: In your opinion, if you don't control the pronator, it's very difficult for Hutchings to win without it? Yes, because he's always pronating and pressing with his shoulder. If he doesn't knock them out, I think his ligaments are very strong, so he holds them. He covers all the top players, and they can't do anything, because they all pull to the shoulder, here, and try to knock them out.
SPEAKER_00: every top roller tries to go here pulling and i feel like if you don't control his pronator it feels like his his tendons are so strong he just goes you know and just presses you down yeah every time if he has a pronator then his side is strong but if you control here then it is it is harder yeah um question like tatachi's wrist
SPEAKER_03: It's strong, but he is not known with like a super wrist dominance. He usually a little bit loses his wrist and then he goes with the sideway. So were you surprised when Tuck hook you? Like, like you, you actually went to hook with him and he put you in losing side and you lift him and you bring him in one.
SPEAKER_03: For me, two things were surprising. Todd to hook you because Todd showed the hook. I thought that maybe you would top roll him. Did you not try to top roll him? You were comfortable and you said, okay, let's go inside or
SPEAKER_00: You couldn't uproll him. First question is... Well, look, Hutchinson, he has a strong wrist, but he is not known for the fact that he twists strongly. And when you were fighting, when you twisted inside and he took you to his side and you pulled him back, did it surprise you somehow? Because when I watched, I was surprised that you immediately went into the hook. And then the question is, did you try to twist him and you didn't succeed? Or did you just go into the hook with him and fight there?
SPEAKER_01: I remember that I beat him in the first fight. He didn't expect me to do it. But then he changed his mind and hit me with a supinator. It was impossible to hit him with a supinator. But it didn't work out. I couldn't get into his bicep. The first time it worked out, but then I couldn't.
SPEAKER_01: He covered well. So I had to fight there. I watched and understood that this is the strongest part. And I thought that this is the last place where you can get to him. This is the last place where you can fight with him in the hook. And yes, I was partly surprised that I was able to pull him out of the top position. I can't imagine that it would have been so easy. Yes, because this is his most dangerous side. Well, yes, I didn't want to get there at all.
SPEAKER_00: I didn't really want to get inside, so I got surprised when he dragged me out and I pulled him back. I was surprised because I feel like this is the strongest part and you shouldn't go there against Todd. As for the wrist, first round I remember I went outside and I bit him. No, no, no. I'm saying that when Todd hooked him later on,
SPEAKER_00: like he couldn't top roll or he didn't he said it as well i'm i'm going like he said in the first round i surprised him maybe and i went outside but the later on i felt like he supinated and crushed on me so much i couldn't roll out you know i didn't feel like i went inside and i started pulling him so i was surprised that i could actually match here yeah yeah we were surprised too because that took him here and then from here
SPEAKER_03: He brings it back and he won. Alex, sorry for spending a lot of time here. No, it's okay. No, I'm saying to Kurdesha. Because this is a match that he pulled. Sorry, sorry, Alex. You know, for me, it's a pleasure because it's deep analyzing of the match. And I believe it's the best way we have David. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because David pulled both of the guys. And right now, I mean, just imagine that a guy, like two guys pulling against him.
SPEAKER_03: He pulled against both of them. And then, David, you are saying that if he didn't change anything, he's going to lose again. When you say, like, if he changed something, you mean the control in Pronator by Irakli. Is that what you mean? Yes, look, if Irakli hasn't changed anything, you think he's going to lose. But how do you think, if he changed something, and if he adds Pronator's control, will something change?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I just know how tough Hutchings is. I took his hand. Irakli was probably more honest. He was like, when we took him, he took it and let's fight. And Hutchings has a sportive trick. He clung to it, didn't let it grab him, somehow tried to do something. In any case, I will give my preference to Hutchings. I think he is in all aspects
SPEAKER_01: If, of course, Irakli is such a start, I don't know, he trained himself, he will beat through the top, Hutchings will not have time to do anything. Hutchings is like a tractor, he barely turns in at the end. But in any case, I give Hutchings my preference.
SPEAKER_00: I would still go with Todd because I feel like I gripped up both of them and I pulled both of them. And I just feel like when Irakli comes up to the table, he just sets it down and he just grips and then he starts pulling. With Todd, it's more like he has some tricks. He's going on with the setup, you know, getting something.
SPEAKER_00: The only way I see it, maybe if Irakli trained up some incredible off-the-go start and explosiveness and he just went outside and didn't let Todd get in the match. I just feel like Todd, he needs some time to get in. But when he stops it, you know, he has so much power just stopping. But I would still go with Todd. And Alex, how do you see this match? For me, it was the best deep analyzing, really deep analyzing of the match. I agree with David.
SPEAKER_02: And also, what I can add, on the paper, Tudharchin is his favorite because of the previous score and result of the match. When I saw the match with Kadyr Gali, I know Kadyr Gali is very talented and his armwrestling IQ is very high. And I know that he's trying all the possible ways. And I need to say that he was trying to find where the weaknesses of the Tudh, yeah? And...
SPEAKER_02: For Irakli, like a top-rower, it can be just an uncomfortable match. His usual weapon can be not effective. And only one thing that it's in Georgia. And maybe Irakli do really some extra things.
SPEAKER_02: So I believe that no matter where the match is, Irakli has to do something extra. You know what I mean? I will explain you. I mean that Irakli didn't need to go somewhere. He will not feel any jet lag. He will be, you know, 100% concentrated. At least Todd Hutchins have a long flight. Yeah, but it's not something doing extra. You are not doing extra, in fact.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but you know, also what motivates him, you know, if he loses somewhere with Hutchins, he already did. And now he wants revenge, you know.
SPEAKER_03: I believe this will motivate him because it's like revenge. He has the motivation. The match is there. This is his third title match. If he wins, he gets the permanent belt. That's a revenge opportunity for him. The match is in Tbilisi. Family, everyone is coming. So he has all due, all due. But, you know, when you go there, only this helps you. I mean, other things, just, I mean, you really need to prepare everything if you are playing Tata Cengiz.
SPEAKER_03: I think it will be very personal for both of them. You can prove old school and Irakli wants to take revenge. It will be very, very personal for both of them. Let's see. If this Tata game wins, I wouldn't plan to set another match anytime soon unless
SPEAKER_03: This is like very like deadly, you know, battle, you know, and then you want to see that again. You know, it doesn't matter if Todd won two and a half years ago. So I would just consider this like a first match because it's very close. So everyone would like to see them again at some point, not right away. But if Irakli wins, I think there should be a rematch at some point for sure. But it depends, you know, how dominant the match is. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So who is winning, Alex? Todd Hutchings. Hutchings is winning. Okay. So you both think that Hutchings is winning. Yeah. Okay. So let's go to the next one. We talked about Laletin versus Morozov. So we have two of them.
SPEAKER_03: So first, let's go with Michael versus Hermes. David. David, I want a little bit analyzing, not like Michael or Hermes, you know. A little bit deep analyzing, please. I'm interested to hear how you analyze the match, how exactly it will go, and not just Michael or Hermes.
SPEAKER_01: Michael's and Hermes' techniques are very comfortable. Why can they fight well? Because Hermes adjusts his shoulder very well. As he showed before, in the same format he won him. In what form was Michael, let's leave it for now.
SPEAKER_01: But here, I think, Hermes rested for a long time, he recovered for a long time. Moreover, if I'm not mistaken, his last fight was with Levan, right? He didn't fight after that. He fought with Vitaly Hermes. With Vitaly? With Vitaly, really? Well, I mean that he rested for a long time, his form is good now, fresh.
SPEAKER_01: And this part, when Michael barely managed to push, and Hermes is better at adjusting his shoulder. And I'm more than sure that Hermes, with this technique, and as Denis told me, that probably Michael is the only one who can fight.
SPEAKER_01: It's like putting your shoulder down and pressing with the press. And I think that Hermes' technique, that he's good at it, will give him a big advantage. And I think he'll win because of his technique. And so to hang, to try to fight him, to hook, it's just useless. You'll get tired, but he won't.
SPEAKER_00: I feel like Ermis is going to win because he's technically better for Michael and I feel like their match is always going to be very interesting because Ermis is really good at getting in with the shoulder you know and I feel like he had a very good rest it was a while before his last match so he had a good rest he got very good shape and
SPEAKER_00: compared to their last match we don't talk about it doesn't matter what shape was uh michael in he was still getting in and he was like pressing him down and i feel like where gennady couldn't finish him just that one bit i feel like hermes is better at getting in with the shoulder using it more and i feel i feel like he's gonna finish him i feel like he can actually pull him down and pin where gennady couldn't
SPEAKER_03: I feel like that's the only way to pull Michael. You shouldn't really try to hook him or top-roll him because he would just get tired. David, do you think that Hermes should do press like Gennady did or do you think that Hermes should go out and then do the press?
SPEAKER_01: What do you think is better for Hermes? Is it better for Gennady to climb up and push, or is it better to climb up, climb up, climb up and then... That's exactly how Gennady climbs. He climbs up and gives his wrist. And Hermes stretches, seems to control the wrist, and with this part he climbs up, it turns out. When he starts to push, partly his wrist does not fall through. Therefore, due to the wrist, he also controls. On the finger.
SPEAKER_01: Yes. And when Gennady gets in, he already gives away his wrist, and it turns out that he presses this part. And that one, it turns out, stretches. There is no control of the wrist. Another advantage of this is that Hermes also holds the wrist from above and initially stretches it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I feel like that's another point where Ermes is very good because Gennady dives in instantly without the wrist and he's just flopping in. And Ermes, he goes out, he climbs, climbs, climbs, gets on the fingers, pulls them out and then with wrist control he can press more. I feel like he has more wrist control than Gennady when he just goes in. I feel like, yeah, that's another point where Ermes is very efficient in that way.
SPEAKER_03: yeah so he's saying that he should go that way okay because the reason I asked this question because he said that he compared with Gennady that a bit that Gennady couldn't go Hermes would go there so I wasn't sure if he was suggesting that way or outside way because that is not Hermes goes right away Hermes usually top rows top rows and then finishes and Alex here I think that you and I we need to talk
SPEAKER_02: a bit longer last time as we talked with David Longer, you know, because it was his category guys and now your category. So how do you see this? So, you know, first of all, both guys will be in phenomenal shape. Both guys know the meaning of this match. After this match, who won will pull with King. And both of them will be in a very, very special level, which means both will be so powerful. But what I need to say,
SPEAKER_02: About the style, in this case, really styles make the match. And what I believe that Ermes will be faster on the start. He will be better on the hand control. He will be trying to open the angle and get the hand of Michael on his side. And without losing the wrist, he will be climbing on the fingers, like climb, climb, climb. And if need, he has an option, honestly, very good.
SPEAKER_02: flop press. No, he can't do this. And even without like this, he just going by shoulder, like David says, and he will go here, like in a comfortable way. He will go to the triceps, but without
SPEAKER_02: extra pressure on his fingers because with Michael it can be problem if you lose little bit your angle position and you make the pressure on your fingers after that you can lose the position which will be optimal to pressure because if you control everything it's question of the time like you pull pull pull you're not really exhausted here because even like your opponent in the open
SPEAKER_02: angle his biceps will be pumped pumped more and more he will be bleeding and because of that you have better options and more chances and like i said hermes have even more chances with hand control even if to finish without like with flow press he also was good with this but michael understand everything of this and what suppose for michael he needs to go
SPEAKER_02: as far as possible outside, like go there. Not like here, but go there, there, there from the pad. And try to make it not possible for Hermes to attack comfortably. Because if he lets Hermes to start, Hermes will take the wrist and hand control and he will be able to finish by triceps.
SPEAKER_03: even by a flop press. So for me, Hermes is a favorite. Do you think that there is any pulling style that can surprise Michael on this earth? Do you think that there is anything that he is not experienced against? You know, Michael have a big, big experience versus everything. Sometimes in the past,
SPEAKER_02: Some guys was able to control his hand with supination and to make impossible to him to go to the king move. It was like something which he was not like too much because it was like his main weapon was not effective. But if somebody trying to top roll him or side pressure, Michael very good with this. He knows how to... Okay, one second. When Michael started this open arm, who was able to hook him?
SPEAKER_03: Or in the past, when he was not... No, no, for example, when John was take his wrist and go into supination, like, hey, go here... No, no, he was not really hooked, you know, he still had the, I think, pronated. You're talking about John versus Michael Massey? I will say something about that much. Like, I don't think there is anyone on this earth who is more...
SPEAKER_03: fan of John than myself, you understand? Like, there is nobody. I mean, I can, like, I really admire the guy. He's incredible. For me, arm wrestling. But Michael had a few minutes of matches against Jerry before he pulled John. So that wasn't really a fresh example. But yes, John had the way to beat. But I don't think that John hooked him. But he had the wrist.
SPEAKER_03: But John had the pronator, you know, I wouldn't call it... Not clear supination, but like wrist... Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was not like, you know, like hook, but it was just, yeah, he had the wrist, yeah, for sure. But the way that John beat...
SPEAKER_03: Michael, you mean that one, not really hook, but you mean that, like, you know, having risk, maybe a high hook. In the first edition of King of the Table, Devon also did like something like that. Devon did that, yes, but Devon one round actually also hooked him, you know, there. He just pressed on his pronator, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, one round. But it was later round that Michael was exhausted. But I think that day there was a really serious difference between those two.
SPEAKER_03: So my opinion, I don't think just because someone did that to Michael, it doesn't mean that he doesn't have experience for that one. That day, he couldn't resist. I'm not saying Michael never lost, but I'm just saying that there is nobody that on this earth that can pull Michael in a way that Michael was like, oh, what happened? I never seen this before, you understand?
SPEAKER_03: So what I'm just saying, he pulled against Denis, he pulled against Pushkar, he pulled against Devin, Jerry, like everybody he pulled against. So what I'm just saying, and also for me, Hermes is one of the best pullers in the world. When I say best puller, I'm not talking only about his strength, his results, but I'm talking about the guy who knows Hermes.
SPEAKER_03: He can do a lot of things. He can finish that way. He can finish this way. He can top roll. So he knows how to win. He's one of those guys. Just look at his match with Laletin. I'm not saying he never lost or something, but he's very well-rounded. I don't know how good his hook, but he's very good. So I think that both guys know everything. There is no surprise in this match. That is only the performance. Not only the performance, but the preparation already.
SPEAKER_03: and then what you perform on that stage. Because I have seen a lot of guys, they are incredible at training, but their knees shaking, you know, when they go to that stage, they can't really perform as good as... I don't think anybody's knee will be shaking there, East versus West. You can't even go to that stage if you're not brave enough, but yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So you are saying that Hermes has motions. When you ask me about what he's not expected, I mean he's not expected hook or supination because it's not effective versus Michael. He's expecting the experience, but the attempts are usually unsuccessful because of Michael's strong proponation.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I have seen a lot of people try his experience to that attempt, you know. Anyway, so let's go to the last one. David, Gennady Kubikvinya versus Devon Larratt. And how do you see this match? So hard.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, I don't know. I think I saw a photo of Ilarat, he really picked up a lot of weight, he became a little fatter. I think he understands that the match is a revenge and he prepares better. And on the one hand, this is the homeland of Gennady, and he also puts himself at 100% advantage. I can't give it to anyone, because such a fight was really very equal.
SPEAKER_01: 50-50, honestly, who will come in, who will leave, who has how many fights. Gennady's triceps and endurance are also very good. Larratt cannot use his advantage of endurance against Gennady, because he is also quite strong. So, probably, 50-50.
SPEAKER_00: I'd say probably 50-50. I wouldn't get a favor to anyone because I see Devin. When I see his pictures, you know, his cheeks are big. He looks very chubby. You know, I can tell that he's getting bigger. And for Gennady, I could say that it's his country. It's in Georgia. So he's going 100% as well. And their first match was so close as well. I feel like Gennady is one of those people who...
SPEAKER_00: When Devin pulls him, he can't use his endurance as much because Gennady's endurance is just as good. And his triceps is very good as well. I feel like Gennady will really match him on endurance type and it's going to be a very close match. I can't really get a clear favorite for me. Guys, by the way, Tuesday, Denis Siplenko will be my guest.
SPEAKER_03: on YouTube podcast, just for your information. And David, who do you support between Gennady and Devon? Why? Why?
SPEAKER_00: you know just you're trying you're trying to say the amount for something no no no i i'm expecting him to stay down you know if he pulls against devon he's gonna support them if david if he pulls against devon then he's gonna support him he's gonna support yeah okay
SPEAKER_03: yeah okay the the same as he is sporting alex now now right of course yeah yeah okay and let's go alex i think i know your opinion i think you are saying that devon is clearly favorite i would say a little bit more than uh yeah yeah yeah i know i know i know firstly yeah who is the devon uh devon is a guy
SPEAKER_02: who understand that Meslin may be one of the best in the world. And he knows where he needs to be strong. He can go under the skin of his opponent. He will make this match very, very personal for Gennady. He will make very aggressive trash talk for sure.
SPEAKER_03: he will do the bring the will and the heart and the spirit of winning to georgia okay okay okay let me get it i will go you continue like whenever he does this like is it good thing or bad thing to do for someone like he usually breaks opponents mentally do you think that he will be working against canadi or not so firstly what what i said about this style
SPEAKER_02: We are warriors, so we need to be ready for this. And with Gennady, I believe it motivates Gennady even more. It's fired up him. Yes, Gennady will be angry.
SPEAKER_02: But angry Gennady will be more dangerous than calm Gennady. Because angry Gennady will die but not lose. You know what it means? He will do everything possible. He will be trying to broke himself but win for any price. He will be trying to do anything possible as hard as much, even more harder than his body gives him the chance.
SPEAKER_02: Gennady is very endurable Gennady is a guy who also find the key and actually Gennady know the weakness of Devon like okay Devon have not so much weaknesses and Gennady like um know where is better not to go and where is the possible line of a good fight with Devon
SPEAKER_03: Devon will be extra motivated and bring his best shape. He's already best shape. He made 105 kilos on the scale. You saw he still was strong. Devon that I know would beat Petrenko.
SPEAKER_03: But I wasn't sure if 105 kilo Devon would beat Petrenko. But he did it. And yeah. So right now he's very heavy. You can see his arms and everything. I think he's in the best shape of his life whenever he says this. I don't think that he's only doing like intimidation. But he really believes that. Yeah. I think so. So do you think Devon is in that shape? In my opinion, in part because...
SPEAKER_02: So what I want to say, and after that I will answer for the question. In my opinion, it's impossible to beat Devon by trying to take his hand control over him now. It's impossible to try... Unless your name is Levan Staginasvili or something. Only one, yes, only one this. But for most of our human beings,
SPEAKER_02: It's impossible. One line is good if you go a little bit here and after that, flop press. Gennady is able to do this. On the set-up, it will be a real war. Before even the goal, it will be a real war because Devon will be taking a better position. Gennady will be trying to not give him this opportunity.
SPEAKER_03: It will be a nightmare for referees. I'm already really, really sorry about that. Listen, I know that they both will do their best. But refereeing, I will talk with the referees. They will be very strict. Both sides have some complaints. Some say about his elbow, some others say about the shoulder. We are going to make sure
SPEAKER_03: that shoulders square and nobody starts before the goal, it doesn't matter if that, I mean, I would like to ref that match, but I trust the referees, you know, that they will just go. So I'm just saying that, listen, no matter what happens there, I'm the person, you know, that they complain to you. So I don't want that, you know, I want referees to be strict and athletes to listen,
SPEAKER_03: Whoever wins, wins. A lot of things that like, I don't like Devon winning or something. It is like crazy there. I mean, from business point, like if Devon is winning, it's good. But I'm not here for business. You understand? I'm not here. I just, whenever I want to, whenever I quit this job, like I want people to say that.
SPEAKER_03: oh yeah he was an aggressive guy this and that but he was a fair guy that's for me the most important part so you can just ask the referees i always tell them listen guys by the rules you know you are blind you know you don't see country you don't see names you know this is you just need to apply so i mean whoever wins listen alex you you have been training for many years i i have competed for 30 years like like this sweats
SPEAKER_03: All the athletes are the same, you understand? The pain, injuries, everything, dreams, everything is the same. So we just need to do everything fair and square. I really don't care. If I was an organizer, I would just sit down and maybe I would have a favorite. But right now, I don't really care. All our brothers and sisters in armwrestling, and that is, yeah, you are right. It will be a tough match for the referee here. Go ahead, Soy.
SPEAKER_02: And after a ready goal, you know, it's so not easy. Even you pin once Devon, like second time when you need to pin him, it will be absolutely different and even harder. Like Devon becomes stronger and stronger with every match. Like it's not about his endurance, but about his ability to find your weaknesses. And like I said before, he for sure will find
SPEAKER_02: mental pressure on Gennady before the goal. And what I mean by mental pressure? He will be trying to make Gennady as aggressive to not taking care about set up and just go. And if they take too much control,
SPEAKER_03: it's very hard to do something with him you know it's not like pure power don't work with you know do you think that is this um like mental games is the like sometimes it's like a russian roulette that like if it doesn't work that that that may because you are depending on it you understand you are depending on your opponent to
SPEAKER_03: come to a mental stage that you would like to. But if it doesn't work, then you are invested there, you know what I'm saying? And then it's not happening. Do you think that it would have a negative effect if Gennady doesn't get affected by the game? Like, for example, I will tell you something. When we did the press conference the day before, the East versus West 7, when Gennady and Devin pulled,
SPEAKER_03: I thought that Gennady was mentally broke down. Of course, I didn't tell anyone. I said, I look at Gennady, like Devon was just as himself as usual at the press conference. And I look at Gennady, Gennady looked to me like broken. To me, it looked that way. And then the next day,
SPEAKER_03: I mean, he was not, he was just like, he was just, I don't know, like, do you know how it is? I think Michael says the best about Gennady. Michael says that,
SPEAKER_03: One should never give hope to Gennady during the match. You need to really like dominate him so that he wouldn't have hopes. Because once he sees something is in the game, he is like so hyped. And then the guy starts the match with 187 centimeters and he ends up like 220 tall, you know. He's growing more and more with every Opana, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And who do you think is going to win? Do you think Devon is going to win? So, first of all, it will be a very, very great match. Maybe even greater than all the other matches of this year with Devon. Because, you know, Gennady in Georgia, you know, lose in the front of your people, it's not what you want. You want to die but not lose. And what I say is that
SPEAKER_02: Gennady has a very big heart. He's a real warrior and what I say is that he will prefer to die but not lose. What I mean by this is that he will go so hard, he will be ready to get injured but not to lose. I hope nothing injury happens for neither of us.
SPEAKER_03: like very hard to come to their level, you know, like, like you don't become Devon, you don't become Devon like overnight, you know, or not even like some years, you know, it takes 20, 30 years to become that way. And we don't want any kind of serious injury, which both had,
SPEAKER_03: Devon for many years had from his elbow and then he injured his bicep and Gennady is still recovering. I hope he fully recovered because he really needed to be fully recovered to have chances against this Devon. And yeah, we will see, Alex. What I want to add, it's never going to be easy versus Devon. You need to be also without any limits.
SPEAKER_02: If you have your version, for example, you are a very good athlete. So with Devon, you need to become even better. Because what I mean that it's not enough to be stronger. It's not enough to be faster. Even if you have better hand control of pronation, it's not enough. And that's why it will be not easy. And that's why I put Devon in the favorite. Are you personally a little bit intimidated by Devon?
SPEAKER_03: mean does he motivates me no are you intimidated like are you like like you have your concerns if you would pull against Devon like you would see your chances lower than him lower than Gennady or lower than Devon you know we are have like it depends on the arm or or doesn't matter even even it's about right we have like a little bit another
SPEAKER_02: What I need to say is that I'm not in that point where Devon is. A lot of years of experience and understanding of arm wrestling needed for me to be there. I can be very strong. I can be good in something. But what I want to be is really understanding of arm wrestling in some level near to Devon. Just say that right now you have a left arm match. Just say that.
SPEAKER_03: Four months from now, if you would pull, would you accept the match? And how would you see your chances? You would accept to pull him right arm or left arm? Right and left. I really accept. Left is better for me, but I also agree right. And how would you see your chances? Just tell us, you know, stop being so diplomatic. It will be a very interesting match. Very, very interesting match, honestly, yeah. How do you see your chances pinning him three times?
SPEAKER_02: On the left, I would say the time very, very, very, very, very slow favorite. On the right, you know, nobody tell you before what I will tell you now. I would say that he's a favorite. I shouldn't say that much. Yeah. Okay. I understand. But I will be still will be the guy who will give him the best find of all other guys. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so just knock the door and then tell me when you think that you can beat him, then maybe we set you a match. Okay. Okay, so yeah. And one last question. David, who has more chance against Levan?
SPEAKER_00: Last question for you. You said that Ermes is a favorite and he will win against him. But if they fight with Levan, who has more chances? Because this style is also taken into account. Maybe, for example, Michael will have more chances. How do you think?
SPEAKER_01: No, I don't think so, to be honest. I think Levan's pressure is also good enough that he can pass Michael just as confidently as Jerry did. Because there were some legends about Jerry. He has a good curl, a good triceps. But as you saw, so far no one is against Levan. At any rate, at the moment, I think I see Hermes and Vitalik.
SPEAKER_00: I feel like Levan can do the same against Michael that he has enough power and pressure to do just the same what he did to Jerry because everyone was saying oh Jerry has a good good hook good triceps and everyone's getting excited but we saw how it went and I feel like Hermes and Vitaly are the only ones that have any chances and Alex how do you see your chances against Vitaly or
SPEAKER_02: I think I have a good chance. Of course, I respect both guys and they are, like Hermes, now higher in their position.
SPEAKER_02: And we need to remember that Vitaly, when before like rankings of now, I put him on the top three now. For today on this shape, I will put Vitaly on top three. And for me, both guys are very interesting. If you ask me who I like more to pull, I would say Dermes. He's my good friend. So firstly, I want to pull Dermes if it's possible. But for sure, I agree also to pull with Vitaly. Someday we need to pull.
SPEAKER_02: And the last question. Does Levin have a chance against Levan? Right or left? Right. Left, Levan doesn't pull. So, you know, he has the best chance of hand control, but Levan is able to flop press. Oh, you think he's going to top roll him? I would say that, for example, even you take pressure off Levan wrist, he's able to go deep with very huge power. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
SPEAKER_03: So you are saying that in any case, Levan wins? Yes. Okay. Anyways, guys, I took you guys. I didn't know that it took that long. I can't believe. And sorry for taking such a long time. David, Alex, thank you very, very much. And I see you guys in Tbilisi. Come in good shape. And let's do a great show. Thank you. All the best. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
