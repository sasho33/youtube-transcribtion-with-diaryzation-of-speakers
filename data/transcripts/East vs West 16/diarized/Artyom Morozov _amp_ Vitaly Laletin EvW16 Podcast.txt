Alex: Hello, Alex. How are you, my friend? Good. A little bit nervous, but good. You? Good, good. I thought your Russian is good, better than English. Yeah, Russian is my best language, by far. Then nothing to be... If you were not nervous with Genadi and Devon, don't be nervous. Yeah, exactly. These are the calmer guys, you know, compared to the other two, you know.
Vitalii Laletin: But we are live now, just for you. Oh, really? Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, so you can be... Okay, okay, wait. Just relax. I remember Morozov and Devon, that was tough as well. So, after that... Yeah, yeah, they were very hype, you know.
Alex: I heard that each of them drank like 50 Red Bulls, you know. 50 cans of Red Bulls. Oh, no, no. That's way more, way more. Way more than that, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you can be the hype, you know. With 50, what's 50? 50 before sleep. Yeah. Emir, it started.
Alex: so okay we are waiting for Artyom and Vitalii to come ah did you know that Vitalii Artyom is about 140 kilo now okay he does look good he looks good i think he has never been before this big you know and it's and it's Artyom so it's pure quality
Alex: Yeah, yeah. Like a superhero, yeah. I think Artyom is just playing some underdog game, you know? This is what I realized. If he really didn't believe he was 140 kilos, what is that, you know? He's probably right now near 10 kilos heavier than Alex Kudaibergen.
Alex: Oh yeah, I remember. He even looked a little smaller for Alex. Yeah, yeah. I think until the Matushenko match, he still didn't look so big after that Stomach issue, you know. You remember? Yeah, yeah.
Alex: Oh, but before that, the preparation was crazy. It was very big. Yeah, he was getting ready for level one. And then he got, I think his craziest shape I have ever seen when he pulled against Corey West. I think he looked very big there. Very big, very dominant, and very strong. And I was in the same event, you know. Yeah, I remember. I pulled Coach K. Yeah, yeah.
Alex: Yeah, that match made me realize how much hatred I have, you know? I mean, in the match, people say, oh, it was early start or something, and then I put the slow motion. Almost every round, Ray starts first, and then I hit him. But just because when you are dominant, only your moves is, unless it is a slow motion, you know? They're going to find anything to complain, like always. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.
Alex: You walk on the sea, they will say, you don't know how to swim. Exactly, trust me. I'm 50 years old. That is some of the people, you know. I really wish them a life, you know, without, you know. Because that's the easiest thing, my friend, easiest thing. I have met two type of people in this life. Some just folks. Some really does the job, you know.
Alex: so that that that is how you know the three from their fruits you know what job you know they have done till today because talk talk is so easy you know you can just i i remember one of the you ever follow football a little bit a little bit yeah
Alex: I remember they did a test, you know, one of the guys that football fans were just cursing and screaming the guy, you know, how he missed that position. And they brought the guy.
Alex: And he couldn't make the scoring to do, like, empty plays. Like, there was no resistance. So it's not as easy. You can teach Messi, you can teach Ronaldo, you can teach Michael Jordan, you can teach everyone. You sit down, TV is in front of you. Oh, what is that? I would even better, you know. Yeah, for sure. Very easy to judge. Who came here?
Alex: hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello
Artyom Morozov: Yeah, I figured, so we can start already, no problem. Okay, okay, okay. So what to do? What to do here? I mean, yeah. Yeah, so how is everything, Vitalii? How are you, in general? It's okay, everything is good, everything is perfect. My hands are working. I'm getting ready. So I think everyone will come to a higher level.
Vitalii Laletin: All good. I feel great, perfect. My hands, both are working very good. So I think everything is going to be at the highest level. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And what's your weight now? 140? How much do you weigh? 143 now. 143. Wow. Is it his heaviest? Is it the heaviest? Or was it more? The maximum was 144, but I think it will be 145.
Alex: so his maximum was 144 but he thinks he's gonna compete and arrive at 145. oh so he will be at his service that that's happening by like naturally or that's happening because of especially for this match
Artyom Morozov: Does it happen by itself that you gain weight? Or do you just want to be bigger for this match? No, I just train and start to get ready, start to grow. When I stop training, when I rest before competitions or after competitions, my weight starts to drop a little. Hello, dear.
Alex: What did Vitalii say? He said that it comes naturally as he trains and gets bigger, but when he lays off the training, the weight comes down sometimes. Okay, so it means that he's training good, he's 143. Artem, when you were not here,
Vitalii Laletin: Vitalii said that you were scared of him that's why you came two minutes late. Is that true? Artem is scared that he's gonna eat him. Vitalii is gonna eat him.
Vitalii Laletin: Artyom, Vitalii is 143 kilos. Almost at his heaviest ever. What do you think? So I'm scared that he's gonna eat me as well as the McDonald's as well. And what's your weight? 140? 110.
Vitalii Laletin: 110. Looks like 110 is only his head right now. Vitalii is saying that Artem should pull Devon because he's 110, but no, he's going to pull Vitalii. Okay, what's his weight? Artem's weight?
Alex: 140? Yeah, 140. 140. Oh, we will have two giants. Two giants. Artem, a question for you. Your right-hand match with Vitalii, does it have any psychological effects about this match on you?
Artyom Morozov: Yes, no, no, it doesn't affect me at all. I think Vitalii will understand me. Well, the hands are different, anything can happen. The right is not the left, the left is not the right. On the contrary, the fight on the right gives a little understanding of Vitalii's technique.
Vitalii Laletin: Anyway, I understood something. I hope I learned something from this lesson. I think not because the right is not left and left is not right and Vitalii can agree with me. Vitalii even added that Morozov in July is not Morozov in February. And actually I think the right arm match, it kind of helps me because I can think about it. I hope I can get some lesson out of it to think how Vitalii pulls, how is his technique and stuff around the table.
Alex: I mean, from one side, I kind of feel that Artem plays like underdog a little bit. I remember one of his things that he said, you know, that he doesn't look favoured or something like that. But from other side, we see he's gaining weight, 140. And so it looks like he's not going to give the title in his head, you know.
Vitalii Laletin: On the one hand, you seem to lower yourself, as if you were an underdog. And on the other hand, you're already scoring 140, and you just won't give me a title in your head. You seem to have two sides. I'm just bipolar. I'm just kidding. No, I just don't want to be loud.
Artyom Morozov: I don't want to talk about anything, I just want to try to do everything that depends on me and fight. That's why I type and silently don't say anything extra, so as not to shit myself later, I'm sorry. Well, you never know, anything can happen.
Vitalii Laletin: So actually, I have two personalities. He joked about it, that he has two personalities. That's why he says it. As for the match, he just prefers not to talk so much, just because, you know, something can happen. I just prefer to be quieter. I'll come, do my best, get my best shape, and I'll fight for it. So I just prefer not to talk so much. Okay, and Vitalii,
Alex: Your right arm match against Morozov, does it have any importance for you to judge the upcoming match or not?
Artyom Morozov: Artyom decided to keep the title on his left hand, so he gave it to me on his right hand on purpose, so that I could break the sphere path. He gave me his right hand on purpose to mislead me, and he wants to win on his left hand. I understood his tactics, I understand it all perfectly and I will try to perform very well.
Vitalii Laletin: Actually, I think Artem is very smart and he gave away the match on right arm. So I kind of have false judgment of the left arm. But I got his plan and I'm preparing myself so I can do my best. So he will not... Come on, come on. He doesn't believe that Artem gave his right arm. You yourself don't believe that he gave you the power to the right. Vitalii? Well, you can rewatch the video. Artem didn't even bother to give it to me on purpose.
Vitalii Laletin: You can rewatch the match. You can see Artem isn't even trying to pull me. I mean, if that is the case, we should not work with Artem anymore. I can't hear him. He's very late.
Alex: He's going to show himself on the left arm because he's a left arm superstar, right? No, he's with both arms. But I kind of think that Laletin is just like low key disrespecting Artem by saying that he didn't try. Just meaning that he was just too strong. He didn't even feel him. There was like nothing. That's what I feel.
Vitalii Laletin: I think Artyom did very good and my right arm is still recovering from the match.
Vitalii Laletin: Oh, yeah? So he pulled against Zeranoff, which have been recovered. Zeranoff wasn't trying as well. He was giving him a nice one. Okay, okay. So that's the new way to...
Alex: I don't know how to say, not the disrespect, but yeah, anyways. He thinks that if it continues that way, Levan is going to give the match as well. Yeah, Levan said that Vitalii will get old.
Vitalii Laletin: by dreaming of beating Levan. He will come, lose, and then he will dream, he will come, lose, and he will get old like that. Does Ladesin agree to that?
Alex: I think I'll get older later than Levan, so eventually I will get him and win against him. Eventually? When? How soon? How about this year? I agree. I agree. But could that be as soon as middle of May?
Vitalii Laletin: I would prefer it to be in October-November because I would get in a better shape and I would be more confident in myself. But this year I'm ready for anyone.
Alex: Yeah, but just what if the offer comes for middle of the May? We'll try. We'll do. Okay. I want to tell to Laletin that now Ermes and Michael compete and the winner
Alex: will get opportunity to pull against Levan. But if Ermes wins, he wants to wait till the end of the year because Levan pulls twice a year. And if Michael wins, he wants to pull early. So if Ermes wins, La Lettine versus Levan. If Michael wins, Michael versus Levan first. And the end of the year, La Lettine versus Levan. But La Lettine needs to stay undefeated.
Alex: when I say undefeated since the Ermes match to get the match to Levan. Anyone who loses right now cannot pull Levan. It will not make sense.
Vitalii Laletin: Michael and Ermes are fighting now. And it turns out that whoever wins will go against Levan. And if Michael fights, he wants to be the first. Therefore, if Michael wins, you will be at the end of the year, and if Ermes wins, you will be the first. And at this time you just need to stay unbeaten, so to speak, do not lose. Because if a person loses, it makes no sense to put him against Levan.
Artyom Morozov: I think I'll pull Levan in May because Ermes is going to win the match. Oh, you think so? That's interesting. That's interesting. And Artur, are you going to share?
Alex: your game plan with lalatin or it's gonna be a surprise on that day what do you think he's not gonna i'm just joking yeah he won't say he won't say it
Vitalii Laletin: I can pull it anyway, so whatever goes better, I'll just do that. Wherever it goes, okay, but you don't want to take it to somewhere. You want to wait and see where it goes? I want to, but there are also spare options.
Alex: Does it matter what kind of plan Morozov has that you had to do this?
Vitalii Laletin: Yes, I understand that he doesn't want to fight. I heard in his voice that he doesn't want to pull me. I understand it now. If he didn't want to pull him, why would he gain up to 140 kilos? If he didn't want to fight, why would he gain 140 kilos? He likes to show his beautiful body. He wants to show that his body is more beautiful than mine. He likes when he looks good, so he wants to show people that he looks better than me.
Alex: oh wait when he gets bigger he looks better huh 140 okay okay i understand yeah anyway so we will see we will see how it will be and the another thing i want to ask um we tell you do you think the gauntlet look better on your hand than then how it looks on uh morozov's hand
Vitalii Laletin: I think it looks better on me because Artem's hand is very small, so it falls off him easily. I think it's better on me. And since Levan is not pulling with left arm,
Alex: Do you think that there is a possibility that you will have both of these gauntlets this year? What is the chance that you are going to have both of these gauntlets on your arms?
Artyom Morozov: I don't think so far. Right now we're focused on this match, on one gauntlet. It depends on when the 11 match happens.
Alex: I understand. He focused so much on this one, so he understands how risky this match is, how serious. So you're fully focused on this glove because you understand how serious the match is. Yes, I'm fully focused on this glove because there are more chances to win.
Vitalii Laletin: I'm focused on lefty right now. Only on lefty because I feel like I have more chances right now with left arm. I have to wait a little bit so I pull righty, go after the right gauntlet. He will have exactly three months, you know, and he's already training. Let him to start training with right arm as well, just in case.
Vitalii Laletin: He already started in the previous year. Right hand? Yes, yes. Okay, then why not? I mean, he will be ready. Anyways, Artur, can you beat this guy in your head?
Vitalii Laletin: Can you beat Vitalii in the head? Yes, I can beat him in the head. I can beat him in the head. Let Artyom beat me in the head, and I'll beat him in the hands. So, Artyom wins against him in the head, and he wins on the table. Vitalii wins on the table. Any response, Artyom? You won't answer anything, Artyom?
Vitalii Laletin: I won't say much. Just how can you win on arms if you can't win in your mind? The mind is the most important part. Yes, I see. Vitalii, did you hear that? Yes, I heard it. I'll take it into account. He'll take it in his mind, yes. He'll remember this.
Alex: Anyway, so, Artem, do you think that Vitalii is right or left arm stronger? Right. Right arm? Yes. And do you agree with Vitalii? Do you agree with Vitalii? Well, in some movements, yes, in general, if you take a pull on the corner, the left is stronger and the right hand is stronger.
Alex: So, in some parts, right is stronger. On left arm, he has more back pressure and rising. Is it true that, I mean, like, does he think that, like, his left riser is stronger because with left arm he was more dominant or...
Alex: Like, because with Wright, he for many years had to pull like this against Krasimir and other guys. And this type of low hand top roll, did it have any negative effects on his riser with Wright's arm?
Artyom Morozov: Maybe it's because you were so dominant on the left, and on the right you had to throw it away against Krasimir and the rest of the guys. Do you think it might have had a negative impact? No, I threw it away with these guys, because they fight in the hook, and I specially gave it away so that they could twist me into the hook. But now I calmly cope with those people who twist me into the hook with a stretched hook.
Vitalii Laletin: Before I dropped the riser just so people couldn't hook me, people like Krasimir. But now I can fight with my riser up and no one can hook me anyway. But is that the reason that his left riser is stronger than his right?
Vitalii Laletin: Maybe because of many years of pulling this way. He always trained it like equally. He just pulled with low hand on the right. His left was just always better. Yeah. It was always just better. Yeah.
Alex: Yeah, so that's why I'm saying he always pulled this way with right arm. So maybe that is the reason that his left riser is better because he always dropped this, you know. Anyway, so it doesn't matter. Another question to Artem. Artem, with left arm, like I remember your match with Di Zerano, left arm. And were you not going like high and top row? Like three, four years ago?
Alex: 3-4 years ago with Goga, you were on top, on the left. Yes, that's right. And then after that you also started hook and other things, you know. So my question is that do you think that last a few years your style with left changed? Like did you become more of inside puller?
Vitalii Laletin: compared to your top row beginner years? Well, it depends on the opponent. I prepared the most extreme fights with my left hand.
Vitalii Laletin: It depends on my opponent, but like my last matches, several of them, I just trained hook, because that was the style. I trained outside, I just didn't have to use it. Artem, I know you don't want to talk a lot about what you plan, but do you think it's possible to hook this guy?
Vitalii Laletin: You don't want to talk about the plans and all that, but do you think it's possible to make a circle in Italy? It's possible. The main thing is to have the strength for it. We'll see. I think it's possible. I just need to be strong enough and we'll see. Okay, okay.
Alex: Vitalii, I had an interview with Levan and Alex was translating and he says that Devon with right arm is deserving second place in the world. Do you agree with that? We had an interview with Levan and he said that Devon with right arm is deserved number two. Do you agree with that?
Artyom Morozov: Well, if Devon is number two on the right hand, let's make a duel between us and see who will be number two. I'm number nine in general. Let number two be number nine. Well, if he's truly number two, let's have a match. I'm number nine, so we will see who is the true number two. But how confident is he against Devon? 99.9%.
Alex: 99.9 percent 99.9 percent wow three zero three zero and and then that one also sees his chances uh very good against you any any comment on this uh
Vitalii Laletin: Everyone sees it for himself, everyone sees it differently. I see good chances for myself. He saw good chances against Devon and we saw how that happened. Okay, so he's also open for an idea to pull against Devon as well? Of course. If there's a good offer, I'm always open.
Alex: Of course, yeah. I'm always open for good matches and good opportunities. Yeah, and another question, if he pulls, like, if Michael wins, and if Michael pulls Levan first, and if Laletin pulls...
Alex: But we don't know if he's going to pull him or not, because we don't know if he's going to go undefeated. So between this time to the end of the year, if Levan pulls Michael first, would you like to face Devon in between?
Alex: No problem, yeah. So he doesn't see himself under risk that if he loses he may not get to Levan but I mean if he's losing to Devon then probably Levan will be hard anyway so there shouldn't be issue, yeah. We will see, we will see how it goes and before we talk about some other matches, Morozov says, Artem said that it is possible to hook you.
Vitalii Laletin: If he gets some stronger, do you agree with that, with left arm? I don't think there's anyone in the world, an athlete, that can hook me on my left arm. And right is possible?
Alex: Right or left, there's no possibility. Okay, if he knows that, nobody can hook him. And then we know that when he loses, he loses from the hand at some point. Very seldom, but he goes there. Is he planning to go more wrist dominant way instead of this, just to make sure to control more pronator?
Vitalii Laletin: Yeah, I'm actually training it so I can contain better.
Artyom Morozov: There is, yeah. Okay. And is that the key point against Levan? Is that the key point against Levan, in your opinion? Last time I lost to him because of the lead and the wrist. Basically, my side pressure was enough to hold him. But since I don't fight with a dead wrist, I lost to him.
Vitalii Laletin: For Lewand I think rising and cupping is the most important because in my match I had enough side pressure. My wrist just went and I can't pull without my wrist. Yeah, but I saw that Lewand was going this way.
Vitalii Laletin: And then from here, and then Levan here, rise up and then go there. So, yeah, as he said, like more riser probably. But inside the table, he couldn't get past me. I was actually pushing him to my side with side pressure.
Alex: It is because of Levan's the bottom two finger in this standard and Laletin's pronator, Levan just couldn't go because of his wrist, I think, in my opinion. Artem, do you have, in your head, do you have an unfinished job with Devon, with left arm?
Artyom Morozov: Do you have this unfinished problem with Devon on the left in your head? It would be a problem for me if there was a real fight. You know, if we approached this fight and something like this happened, it would be a problem. But there are no problems. The only problem is his fans,
Vitalii Laletin: The only problem would be if that was a real match, because it wasn't a real match. It's not really a problem for me. The worst part is his fans just keep spamming me, and I'm tired of blocking them already. So does it mean that he is willing to pull him?
Alex: Yes, but after Vitalii. Of course, I mean, we have the Vitalii mindset already. He said like we said, yeah, after Vitalii. Yeah, yeah, but like if no injury or no pain, does he think that like we have the next event in US after this one?
Alex: Does he think that if no pain or injury, he is ready to do that? And can I ask one more question? Is it going to be a regular, another armwrestling match or it will be a little bit personal?
Artyom Morozov: Will it be just another match behind the table, or will it be something more personal? Yes, it will be another match, I think. What do you think? Nothing personal. I let go of this situation. I'm a yogi, a monk, an ascetic.
Vitalii Laletin: I let it go. It's not personal for me. I think it would be just another match. Like a monk, like a peaceful monk, I let it go and I don't think about it. It's not personal for me. And what if Devon makes it personal? If Devon makes it personal. If someone makes it personal, he will be humiliated publicly.
Vitalii Laletin: Oh, so who's making it personal and personally is going to be not punished, but it's going to be, everyone's going to see that. It's going to be a shame in front of everyone else. Just because of making personal or he's going to pay the price by losing, is what he says. Just because he did it personally? Because of that? Well, personally, what do we have? Personally, it's when a person hurts
Artyom Morozov: The honor and dignity of a person, for example. Something personal, maybe a family, something like that. This is personal. If a person allows something personal, at a press conference, during a fight, if a person allows something personal, then what can you do with it?
Vitalii Laletin: If he makes it personal, I think it's more of him going against my pride and my method and making it in front of everyone, like humiliating me, trying to humiliate me. But I don't think matters like this can be disclosed on the table. I don't think it can resolve on the table. It means that it will resolve somewhere else?
Artyom Morozov: In another place, it is not decided at the table. Such problems are not solved at the table. Well, of course, if something personal is touched. I say, if the honor and dignity of a person are touched, then what kind of armwrestling is it? Armwrestling is a sport of gentlemen. We come out here not to hit each other in the face. And for any insult, for any words of the left, they usually hit you in the face, right? And we go out to fight on our hands. And we do not allow each other to say something bad, personal.
Vitalii Laletin: and so on yeah like i think arm wrestling is it's a sport of gentlemen's you you don't go after a pride and uh like dignity of a man stuff like this people usually fight because of that you get punched in the face and we we arm wrestle at the table we don't uh say stuff like this you know yeah but right now go ahead go ahead well поэтому поэтому для меня не знаю
Artyom Morozov: I think it would be stupid on his part to do something personal, for example, to insult and so on. Well, he's unlikely to do that. And everything that's behind the table, you can joke about the brush, the oil and so on. But it's funny. Vitalii also says that he will beat me. Do you have a brush and oil? Do you have a brush and oil?
Vitalii Laletin: Yeah, he said that I don't think Devon is going to make it personal. Not in like a personal way, like, you know, going against his dignity and stuff. And Vitalii, he said that, you know, he's going to joke about him having a butter wrist and stuff like that. He doesn't mind that. He doesn't care. He's just joking. He's just talking on the table. And Vitalii joked that, oh, you have a butter wrist. I'm going to remember that. Okay. Vitalii is targeting him again.
Alex: Okay, okay. And what's this guy saying? Vitalii is saying? What's the butter wrist? You know how Devon is... No, no, no. I understand. I'm just asking Morozov. I'm trying to provoke him. Vitalii is asking? Like, why? I mean, what is this Vitalii guy saying about butter wrist or something? What's the story? What does Vitalii say about the brush and the butter and all that? Why such things?
Alex: I'm just going to block him on Instagram and that's it, yeah. He's going to block him as well. Okay, they will block each other. Okay, yeah. Listen, blocking is not the right thing to do, you know. Like, take an example here, you know. I know black people, you know. Anyway, so I only blocked like 3,000 people so far. So that's all.
Alex: You look very tired and sleepy because it is over there coming to midnight. Let's talk about some other matches.
Vitalii Laletin: How did you guys find the card? Do you think this card is maybe like the best card so far? David you guys see all the matches? What do you think about the card? Is it the best in your opinion? What do you think about the match and all that? When we fight with Artyom, it's the best card.
Vitalii Laletin: Vitalii said that when me and Artem pull, it's definitely the best card by far and Artem agrees with him. Okay, they both agree. Do you guys think that your match should be the main event?
Artyom Morozov: But it will be the main fight of the night anyway, because look, Ermes, for example, already fought with Michael Todd once. Not on East-West, but they fought. Genadi and Devon also fought. And our fight has been waiting for a long time, at least.
Artyom Morozov: And it's a title fight. Yes, it's a title fight, and they've been waiting for it for a long time. So I think it's a main event. After us, there's a fight, by the way, it's going to be very interesting. Dadikyan vs. Kurdecha. After us. Then the rest. Devon will be at the very end.
Vitalii Laletin: I think ours is definitely the main event. Devon and Genadi will be the first to warm up.
Vitalii Laletin: I think it's definitely the main event because Michael and Ermes pulled already. It's not East versus West, but they already did. Genadi and Devon pulled as well. And ours is a title match as well on Lefty. I think it should definitely be a main event. After us is Alex and David. And Devon and Genadi, I think they should pull first. Like a warm-up. This is what Morozov says?
Vitalii Laletin: And then what does Vitalii say about this? About what exactly? Devon and Genadi first? No, no, I mean generally. Which match should be the main event and also what does he think about the things that Morozov said? He agreed on the main event because he said it's a title match, you know, it's very important for him. Vitalii, what do you think about Devon and Genadi, that they should go first? Well, Devon maybe later,
Vitalii Laletin: Devon should be the first to come out. To warm up the audience. I think he should go late, but he should go first because he's going to get the audience very hot, you know, and ready. Just while he's fighting, about two hours, we'll have the opportunity to sleep, eat, get ready for the fight.
Vitalii Laletin: Yeah, if he goes first, the two hours he's gonna pull, his match is gonna be two hours long. We will sleep, eat, prepare for the match, rest, you know, gonna have our time. Okay, okay, I understand. Anyway, so, and what did they think about this match? Davan Genadi, what do you think about the match, Davan Genadi? I think it will be something similar to what happened last time.
Vitalii Laletin: I think it's going to be similar to the first match. I think it's going to be 50-50. Devon's going to take the wrist. Genadi's going to try to flop him, maybe try to sink a hook on him. But for me, it's a 50-50. And? I think if...
Artyom Morozov: If Genadi didn't take the injury and he would be progressing all this time, I would have him as a favorite. But right now, I think, and people shouldn't be mad at this, I think Devon has the slight edge.
Vitalii Laletin: I think Emre is going to win. He didn't pull for a bit, he rested well, he got very ready in a good shape, so I think he should win.
Alex: I agree with Vitalii, I think Ermes is going to win. A question to Vitalii. Vitalii, this is just an opinion, no disrespect to anyone or something, but honestly I would like to hear, if you would pull Ermes again, do you think you would win now?
Vitalii Laletin: It's a question without any disrespect. Just an interesting and honest answer. If you fought with Ermes again now, would you have won? Yes. That's why you don't want to fight with Ermes now. Ermes told me to fight with Ivan first, then I will fight with you.
Vitalii Laletin: Ermes told him, first you pull against Levan, then you pull against me. You should have seen his very scared eyes when I flashpicked Zeranoff. Oh, Ermes' very scared eyes? Yeah, he was very scared. He even did like this and bowed to me.
Alex: Oh, that's interesting. That's interesting. But Ermes told me, Ermes told me that he doesn't want to pull. He doesn't want, Ermes, this guy, you see this guy? Little.
Alex: Ermes, this guy said that if he would pull you now, he would beat you. And that's why you are scared to pull against him again. And he said, listen, Vitalii said. Ermes. One second. And he said. Ermes. Ermes, do you see them? Pasta, my friend. If he won another lose match. Pasta. Okay. One more loss.
Alex: Oh, oh. Power, power of pasta. Power, my friend. Yeah. Listen, Laletin said that he would beat you now, and that's why you are scared of pulling him again. And he said, wait, wait, listen, stop laughing, stop laughing. And he said, when he beat this, I don't know, your eyes get like so scared because you...
Alex: Why? Oh, that is why you don't want to pull against him because you don't want to block his way.
Alex: Vitalii, Ermes says that he loves you so much. And that is why he doesn't want to play against you. Because he doesn't want you to lose your chance to play against Levan. Tell him that I love him too.
Alex: I love him very much as well. You tell him that and next time I'm going to win. Okay, okay, okay, okay. I mean, like, Ermes tries to help La Lettine and look what La Lettine is doing. La Lettine should be, I mean, I should be thankful that Ermes, you know, like, Ermes doesn't take the mat just to open his way to Levan.
Vitalii Laletin: Just joking. What? No, I just told him that you're joking. Yeah, yeah, I'm joking, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways, yeah. Anyways, so... Artem, how many left-hand wins do you have at the East vs. West?
Alex: I don't remember how much exactly, but I never lost a match. Okay, you beat Tobias, and then you beat Matt Mask, and then you beat Cody, and then you beat Ermes, and then you beat Corey West, and then after Corey West, you beat...
Alex: Kurdecha you beat and then you beat Matushenko and then you beat after Matushenko you beat Kamil Kamil right arm Kamil right arm okay David you count Dadikyan or Dadikyan? Dadikyan yeah yeah eight matches eight matches yeah and then and then Vitalii will be your ninth victim
Artyom Morozov: They say Vitalii will be the ninth victim. I want to do that, of course. I really want to. That's a good number, Artyom. 8-1. 8-1 is a good number. No, no, 9-9 is a good number. 8 plus 1 is much better. Infinity and plus 1, you know?
Vitalii Laletin: 8 is infinity, plus 1 is more than infinity. Artem says that I'll try my best, and Vitalii says that 8 is a very good number. 8, 1 is very good, but Artem says, no, no, no, I have to... 8 plus 1, you know, 8 is like an infinity. 8 plus 1, so it means even more, so it's going to be 9, 0. Yeah, yeah. It's not going to be 8, 1.
Alex: Tell Vitalii that I'm joking with him just to steal the pot.
Vitalii Laletin: Yeah, you're all welcome to throw the pot, like pasta. Okay, okay, yeah. Like, aren't you scared I'm eating pasta like Ermes? Aren't you scared to lose against me? And let's see your bicep, Artem. Nothing much, right? Okay.
Alex: Okay, so. I can show like Ermes, like this. Ermes, these people are making fun with you. Why you always show your elbow like this forearm? See, everyone knows your trick, Ermes. I don't know where you are, but anyway, so.
Artyom Morozov: Okay, question for Laletin. He says that Ermes is going to win against Michael, but how the match will go? You say that Ermes will win against Michael, but how exactly will the match go? Do you see this? Can you tell us? I think that it will be in touch, in movement, in touch. Ermes will stretch, stretch and will hit to the side, and after a while he will fight with his fingers.
Vitalii Laletin: I think it's going to be just four one motions, you know, basically like flash pins. He's going to back pressure and just drive him to the pad with the fingers and the wrist. Wow. Because many people think that even if Ermes wins, he needs to finish with this one. So he thinks that. Oh, okay. Okay.
Vitalii Laletin: Because many people say that even if he passes here, he will have to do it like this. Not like this, but like this. Artem thinks he's going to just, you know, press him with the cup. Okay, Artem thinks that he's going to take him, take this way and then come back and finish. While Vitalii thinks that it will be just one side pressure. Vitalii thinks he can flop him as well. It may happen, but he can flop him.
Alex: Okay, okay. So Vitalii is thinking that it will be straight finishing, while Artem is thinking that it may be two moves to finish. Yeah. Okay. Interesting. Okay, yeah. That's interesting. So if you guys are right, then the next match will be Laletin versus Levan. But if Michael wins, then Michael versus Levan, we will see.
Alex: That is very clear who is pulling who in which case, yeah. And what do you guys think, Vitalii, Kurdecha versus Dadikyan? Dadikyan is now over 120 kilos, while Alex is about 160 kilos. How do you see this match, Vitalii? How do you see this match, Vitalii? David is over 120, Alex is over 160.
Artyom Morozov: It will be an interesting match anyway. The guys are very strong. If David can win, it will be a big sensation. Because I think that Alex is heavier in any case. He is stronger, I think, physically. And if he wins, it will be a sensation.
Vitalii Laletin: I think it's a very good match, but because Alex is bigger, stronger than David, if David pulls out a win and he can do it, it's going to be a big sensation. It's going to be a big thing that he wins against Alex. Okay, the question for Vitalii. Vitalii, did you watch the match between Artem and David? David you watch the match between Artem and me?
Alex: Yes, I watched the match. I was there as well. I was watching the match. Okay. And were you surprised that, you know, as he was at that time 114 kilos, and, like, he almost beat Artyom? Like, were you surprised? No, I wasn't surprised. I know that Dekean is strong.
Vitalii Laletin: I wasn't really surprised because I know how strong Dadikyan is. I was surprised that Artem stopped him and won the match. So, you know, I'm cautious about it. I'm just saying that, like, if 114 kilo Dadikyan
Artyom Morozov: gave that match to Artem, and now he's over 120 kilos. He thinks it's a really low chance that he can have. Even considering that he was 114 kilos then, and now he's more than 120 kilos, in your opinion, he still has less weight than Alex? The weight doesn't really matter. I don't think he'll get much stronger because of the weight. I think he'll stay strong. The main thing is that he's lost his angles. The weight doesn't really matter in his situation.
Vitalii Laletin: I don't think weight matters for him as much. He just needs to not lose the angles, you know, be tighter on the table. I don't think mass really decides for him. But he decides for Alex. That's what he said, right? No, Alex decides. For Alex, mass decides. I think it's more important for Alex and it's better because he's more used to being this big.
Alex: And he's naturally a big guy, yeah. And Alex has a bigger frame, he's taller, so he can get even bigger. His body allows him to be bigger. Yeah, when we know that Alex is really a tall guy, almost as tall as Vitalii, and he has very strong hand and wrist, especially with the left, right also the same, but left I think better.
Vitalii Laletin: Does he think that Alex is a serious threat for Vitalii? No, I don't really see him as a threat. He thinks that he would be comfortable beating him.
Artyom Morozov: So you'll fight him comfortably and win? I think so. I think so, yeah. And Artyom, how do you see Dadikyan vs. Kurdecha match? How do you see it? I think in any case, David will win the start and twist it in his direction, into the hook. But Alex, he also surprisingly holds very well.
Artyom Morozov: I don't know, it's hard for me to judge, because at that moment I was so weak. I was very surprised by Alex, for example, that he can fight in the hook and in the triceps, he is so versatile. The advantage is 60 to 40 in favor of David, I think.
Vitalii Laletin: it's 60 40 for david i think he's definitely winning off the goal on the ready go he's gonna win get him on his side in a hook uh i can't really judge because against alex i wasn't really as good i wasn't really as strong but i was surprised that alex's defense is very good he could really hold above the pad and he's very technical you know he could hook he could try suppress he could do a lot of things
Alex: Alex also has a very long reach, you know, to come, you know, in the past. He has a long arm, he can get in and spin well. Yeah. Yeah. And, okay, let's go to the Petrenko vs. Oleg Zhokh... Sorry, Petrenko vs. Betkely Onianii match at 95kg world title. How do you guys see this match? Petrenko vs. Betkely, 95kg on the left side. How do you see this match?
Artyom Morozov: I think I can be the first to say. Betkili once fought Olezhan at the World Championships. He was competing for Olezhan and Oleg Petrenko was already fighting against Olezhan at the East-West. It was also an equal fight.
Vitalii Laletin: I think it's a 50-50. Petrenko vs. Ponyani. Ponyani just didn't understand his previous opponents. He didn't feel them, to be honest. I think it's a 50-50. Betkely in WoW and Worlds pulled against Alijan and he really made him work. He made him compete. Petrenko did the same.
Vitalii Laletin: Fechenko did the same at East vs. West. They had a pretty good match as well. I just feel like Betkely couldn't really feel the loss of his opponents. You know, it looked like he just went against them so easily. But I would still say it's a 50-50. Yeah, I don't think Oleg Zhokh's match was so easy, especially in the early rounds. Anyway, so how do you see this match, Vitalii?
Artyom Morozov: I fully support Artem. The fight won't be easy for either of them. I think there won't be a fight in one fight. Last time he fought well. He showed his advantages. Well, Oleg Petrenko also showed his advantages. Therefore, the fight will be very interesting. I also think 50-50.
Vitalii Laletin: I agree with Artem. I think it's a 50-50 because I think it's going to be a close match and neither is going to win easily. It's going to be a very tough match because Betkely showed great dominance in the last match as well. He pulled very well and Petrenko showed his skill on lefty as well. Was Vitalii surprised by Betkely's performance against Taino?
Vitalii Laletin: I was very surprised because Tainov seems to be training, being strong, so I feel like they should have a rematch as well. Or he thinks that something may change.
Alex: I think enough time has passed that Artem can surprise Betkely. Okay, another question. Who is the pound for pound best left arm puller today and in the history? But pound for pound, you know, he knows probably, right? You want to explain?
Vitalii Laletin: Do you know who is the best in terms of weight and strength? For the whole history and even now. Artyom Morozov. For the whole history and even now? I don't know, but Denis Tsyplenkov was a strong...
Vitalii Laletin: But pound for pound, he understands pound for pound? I think Oleg, if we go for pound for pound... What does he think about Alijan?
Vitalii Laletin: I think Oleg is very strong but I feel like Oleg was waiting even less and he was very good and in his best shape I feel like they could have a really good match and Oleg was lighter than Oleg. Yeah but does he think that like
Alex: like people like Matushenko was able to beat even Oleg, even in his prime time, you know, like,
Alex: Malin Can, and at those years, you know, Matushenko was about 100 kilos. Now Malin Can won against 115 kilos Matushenko, while as far as I remember, Matushenko easily beat Oleg Zhokh, who can beat him, you know. I mean, I'm not saying, yes, if I would do top two, they would be Malin Can and Zhokh. But when you said that he was lighter,
Alex: But was he really okay in overall championships when everyone gets tired? I also beat Travis Page in overall, but he also beat Pushkar. But he thinks that Zogh would be number one. So best of Zogh and best of Malin Can would be a close match. But because Zogh is lighter, he would be better, he thinks.
Vitalii Laletin: If we take them for granted, Oleg would have won and would be in better shape, and at the same time, he would be even lighter. He just gave an example that Ivan, for example, beat Oleg when he was 100 kg, and now Olezhan beat Matyushenko, who weighed 115 kg, for example. If I were to make a top-2, I would agree with you. I think it's Oleg and Olezhan. Yes, yes.
Artyom Morozov: He agrees that the top two are Oleg and Alijan. I understand. And what kind of chances does Alijan have against him? Vitalii? Yes. What chances does Alijan have against you? There are always chances. I've never fought with him. But I think that with the left hand, I would have fought with Manny Matyshenko easier than with Alijan.
Vitalii Laletin: Chances are always there, but I never pulled him on lefty. I just feel like I would beat Ivan easier than he did. Oh, he would beat Ivan easier than he did? Yeah, than Alican did, yeah. Yeah, but they both went inside, but this is probably different. But he thinks that his chances are higher than Alican.
Alex: Against Ivan? No. His chance against Alizhan is higher than Alizhan's chance against him. Do you think you have more chances than Alizhan? Maybe, yes. I have more chances. I think I have more chances than him. Heavier as well. And Artyom, do you agree with Vitalii? I think at the moment Alizhan still needs...
Artyom Morozov: To become a bit stronger, to compete. Again, I will be able to judge, for example, after I fight with Vitalii. I fought with Olezhan, he beat me. Easy. And now I will fight with Vitalii, for example, and then I will be able to judge.
Artyom Morozov: Maybe I'm wrong, he needs to get stronger, he's already strong enough. Maybe I'm right, I don't know. I need to see how strong Vitalii is.
Vitalii Laletin: I just feel like Alijan needs a little bit more time to get a bit stronger. But the problem is that I didn't pull with Malin. After I pulled him, I could compare Alijan and him because we pulled with Alijan. He beat me easily. So after I pulled, I can say I think for now... But when he said he pulled Alijan, Alijan beat him easily, talking about when it was like four years ago and when
Vitalii Laletin: More or less, it was still... Against Alezhan four years ago? Alezhan too, yeah. You say Alezhan beat you. Was it three or four years ago? Yes, it was already, you could say, yes.
Alex: four four five years ago five years yeah 2020 probably yes yeah yeah i think right before the pandemic yeah that's how i remember but um yeah and then okay let's go daniel prokopchuk versus uh olex brock uh prokopchuk artyom artyom blin yeah
Vitalii Laletin: I think it's going to be very easy for Oleg. And how do you see this, Vitalii? I agree with Morozov. I think it's too easy for Oleg. So he's just going to hold him and beat him like this?
Alex: Yes, I think so. That's interesting. Let's go to another incredible match. Artem, Irakli vs. Todd Hutchings. Irakli. Irakli? He thinks Irakli. I think Irakli will win this time.
Vitalii Laletin: I also tried a little bit of Irakli's hand, I realized that it was very strong. I also think that Irakli will win. I grouped up with Irakli, I tried his hand and I feel like he's very strong, so I agree that he probably is going to win. Anyways, so Fia versus Malin, 70 kg woman, world champion match. 70 kg title, Fia and Malin.
Artyom Morozov: I think FIA is going to win. I think FIA is going to win. Yes, let's see who wins. I don't know. I don't really follow the strength of the girls. It's Artyom who specializes in competing with someone in his strength, and I don't.
Vitalii Laletin: He said that I don't really follow... Vitalii, joke that, you know, I don't follow female armwrestling so much, so I'm not really sure. Vitalii is the one following female armwrestling because he's trying to find a close opponent for him. Oh, Artem. Yeah, and Artem said that I'm just trying to find like a girlfriend, a wife for you because you live with your horse for too long.
Artyom Morozov: Oh, okay. Okay. And... Stoyan Golemanov vs. Vasily Dautashvili. Stoyan Golemanov vs. Vasily Dautashvili. What do you think? I think... Yeah, talk about it. Yeah, this one. I have the right glove, so I'll go first. He goes first because he has the gauntlet. This one. I think...
Vitalii Laletin: I think Vasily is going to win because when I saw him in summer at the qualifiers, it looked like a completely different Vasily. Like a completely different shape, so I think he's going to win.
Artyom Morozov: Vitalii? I also saw Vasily fight in the qualifiers. I follow him on Instagram, how he trains hard and prepares. I can see in his eyes that ESW is a lot, which means a lot to him. He never prepared for the World Championship like he does for ESW, I think, Vasily.
Vitalii Laletin: I think Vasily. And I saw how he pulled the qualifiers as well. And when I follow his Instagram page and follow him closely, I see how he trains very hard. You know, in his eyes, I feel like East versus West means a lot to him. So I feel like he's going to train hard and he's going to win the match. Okay. Okay. And then Baccio Bacho Saginashvili versus Brett Grande. Baccio and Brett Grande. Baccio. 100%.
Vitalii Laletin: 100% Bacho. And Vitalii agrees with Artem. Okay.
Vitalii Laletin: Vitalii supports me so much. When we have a match, Vitalii is going to come in his corner and, like, rub his hand, you know, make him feel relaxed. But Vitalii jokes that he's going to support not him, he's going to support his gauntlet. Okay, okay. And let's go to...
Alex: uh other matches i i'm just like i need to check my list one second frank just let me check my list and okay sergey kalinchenko versus frank lamparelli we have a little guest here is sergey kalinchenko frank lamparelli i
Alex: you think i think sergey's gonna win against him uh hello devon hey guys how you doing champs what's up everybody did you send devon the link zoom link somebody just sent it to me i was just listening to you guys
Devon Larratt: Yeah, he wants to talk to him to face, you know, he sent the link. I have arrived. I have arrived. Do you know that we're going to pull in two months? You and me? Yeah. Really? Is that true, Engin?
Alex: I have no idea. I think Robert hired Vitalii as matchmaker, so possible. I don't know. I thought you were pulling Levan. I wasn't sure.
Devon Larratt: I'll fight Devon later. Devon is scared of me, so he's going to pull him later. Oh, okay. But if you pull me, you might not get to pull Devon. Yeah, but I said he thinks he's going to beat me 99.9%. That's what he said. 99.9%? But he didn't even beat Dave or Ermes. He said, if you fight me, you can beat Devon. You lost against Ermes, and you lost against Dave. Good, good.
Vitalii Laletin: yeah okay okay yeah okay but still 99 percent 99.9 that's some amazing math that's really good how you came up with that are you training did you go to train now
Vitalii Laletin: making breakfast yeah stay in shape devon like keep keep in touch with your body you know i'll be i'll be massive in georgia massive ah devon i told him i said if michael uh wins uh
Alex: Like whoever is going to pull Levan needs to be end of the year. I said whoever because normally it was going to be Vitalii. If he loses, what? Hold on, hold on, hold on. My Wi-Fi was being bad. Say that one more time. If Michael wins against Ermes, Michael is going to pull Levan like in the middle of the year. If Michael wins, he's pulling Levan right away. Oh, so Vitalii is going to.
Alex: vitalia be free you don't know about that one because we say we tell it but i probably tell it we tell you if it is the end of the year that you want to play you don't hear us you don't hear no one more time my wi-fi is spotty one more time please i apologize do you hear me do you hear me now i hear you i hear you now okay okay if michael wins michael is pulling first if right
Alex: like is willing to pull Levan, it needs to be end of the year. But if it is end of the year, Vitalii is not going to stay without pulling. He needs to pull someone in between. And he said he's ready to pull against you. And I said, don't you see any risk about not getting to pull? He said he doesn't see any risk.
Devon Larratt: Maybe that would be a good third time. If you beat Vitalii, everyone will think that this is time again. Be careful what you wish for, young champion. Be careful what you wish for. I might do to you what I did to Morozov.
Vitalii Laletin: My wrists are not so buttery. David you see how smoothly his wrist went back that night, Vitalii? Morozov's? Yeah. 15 February, Morozov's left wrist is gonna go the same way. I'm blocking both of you.
Devon Larratt: That's it. Are we pulling very soon, Morozov? Are you finally going to let me have that match? Yes, I will. If everything goes well.
Vitalii Laletin: After the match with Vitalii, if everything's fine, nothing hurts, you know, no injuries, I'll do it with pleasure. I would gladly pull you. You sure you won't get upset and need Engin to save you? Where's my gun?
Devon Larratt: He's looking for his gun. Relax, Morozov, relax. It's just arm wrestling. For someone it's just arm wrestling, for someone it's life. I understand, I understand. But I will beat you so badly that you won't be able to use your pistol. Pistol...
Vitalii Laletin: Not accurate. Strong wrist for pistol. Strong wrist. Better use a long gun. Not too much wrist. I have a question.
Alex: When you went here and your wrist went back, is that because of his pronation or he was under the table and it didn't go anymore? When you hit him in the jaw, did your wrist go back because of his pronation or because he was under the table? Why does Mike Latoda's wrist go back? Because of his pronation or because he was under the table?
Vitalii Laletin: Why does every opponent of Mike loses the wrist? Is it because he's pronation is stronger or it's because he's under the table? Vitalii, will you let Morozov start at the pin line like I did and still beat him? Easy.
Vitalii Laletin: What are you going to do? I'll let him do anything. Just hook me above the pin pad, anything. Yeah, yeah. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait. Hey, you know, you know, money, money doesn't lie. Money doesn't lie. You see this? Cut out steak. Fatale.
Alex: Artyom. I don't know. Does anybody think? Does anybody believe? Artyom, is Vitalii teaming up with Devon against you or what?
Vitalii Laletin: They need collaboration. Yeah, they need collaboration. Yeah, they're a team with Devon. Oh, he said that they need collaboration against Morozov. Morozov is so good that they need to be team up. Okay, I understand. World champ. Has anybody said hello to Denis recently?
Vitalii Laletin: Yeah, I saw him a week ago. Oh, two weeks ago he saw Denis in Moscow, yeah.
Vitalii Laletin: I heard he's training. I heard he's getting ready for a match. Could you please pass my very best to him and tell him I look forward to our match, which is inevitable? Denis said hello to everyone, but he didn't say anything to Devon or Lara.
Vitalii Laletin: Yeah, and Denis said hello to everybody except Devon Larratt. Do you think that he will dodge me forever? Before he gets ready. So he'll get ready and then he'll pull me? Yeah. Five years?
Alex: I don't know. I'm not Dennis. I don't know. Anyways, guys, it has been one and a half hour. And thank you, Devon, for joining. And Vitalii, thank you very, very much, my friend. And Artem, you need to take care of both of these guys. Both Devon and Vitalii, one after another. Right? You need to sort it out with Vitalii and Devon later.
Vitalii Laletin: Yes, I have to. They're going to... Artyom, eat the pasta. I'm going to eat it. Vitalii says that you should eat some pasta. I'll definitely will. After what you did, teaming up, I'll definitely will, yeah. Yeah. Anyways, guys, is there anything lastly you guys want to add? Is there anything you want to say? I want to wish Artyom good luck, because it will be useful for him.
Artyom Morozov: He says, best of luck to Morozov because he's going to need it. And you should definitely change your haircut so your hair doesn't get in the way with your eyes and you can see everything.
Vitalii Laletin: He tells this to Morozov? Yeah. So he will not forget what he experienced, okay. Because if the hair gets on his eyes, he's not even going to remember how it happened, you know. Artem, you're writing this all down, right?
Vitalii Laletin: you know on my spine i can feel what devon and vitaly saying it's like scratching on my spine you know writing it down i can feel the pain when they're saying it so i remember all of it yeah
Alex: okay okay anyways thank you very much vitaly thank you very much artom and thank you alex and thank you see you guys in tbilisi
