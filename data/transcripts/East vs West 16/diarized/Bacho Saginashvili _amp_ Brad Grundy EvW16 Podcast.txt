Host: And we should be live. So we're waiting for Brett Grundy to join us. I'm here with Georgi Bacho. So how are you guys feeling nine days before big, big event in Tbilisi?
Host: i feel very good i'm in very good shape and i'm coming just for me only for me so um people in the chat uh straight away i'm gonna say so again engine is already in tbilisi so i will do this is the last podcast for east versus west so i'm gonna finish it and we're gonna uh then next week i'm gonna join him there
Host: uh i want to ask your feelings about having this kind of big arm wrestling event in tbilisi it has never been done or you have never seen anything as big that is going to come next week right
Georgi (Translator/Helper): I'm very happy about it. It's a big motivation for Georgians and we Georgians
Host: gotcha gotcha it's uh how does it feel do you feel like it's gonna be like I I haven't been to Georgia so I don't know but do you have insane amount of arm wrestling fans does almost everyone know what arm wrestling is
Bacho Saginashvili: There are a lot of fans, a lot of supporters, and when they will be on our side, on the competition, it will help us a lot. Gotcha.
Bacho Saginashvili: You have a Saginashvili last name, so I feel like that comes with expectation. Do you feel pressure because you are Bacho Saginashvili? No, no, nothing.
Host: Nothing. Nothing. I want to ask him. So last time we saw him compete, I think he competed on versus Reno Masic. Has he competed since? After Reno, I pulled just one time on world qualifications.
Host: gotcha gotcha so the mattress Reno was crazy match like like it was probably one of the one of the best matches we have seen on king of the table so his thoughts about the match what like what does he feel what happened there was there something he could do or Reno was just too strong in his move
Bacho Saginashvili: What do you think, if Rino was very strong, what would have happened to him? I would say that he was very strong. He was very strong. He was very strong. He was very strong. He was very strong. He was very strong. He was very strong.
Bacho Saginashvili: There was my mistake that I gained a lot of weight. And there was also a problem with acclimatization. I changed food, and I changed the climate. And there was a hot climate there. And if I would be less weight, like a little bit lighter, then I could pull better.
Host: So he thinks, yeah, because you get the good positions, but somehow Reno still managed to win. David something surprised? Or did you expect exactly this from Reno?
Georgi (Translator/Helper): What did you think about the match? Was it a good match? David you feel like you were going to lose to Rino? I didn't feel like I was going to lose to anyone. I didn't feel like I was going to lose to anyone. I didn't feel like I was going to lose to anyone. I didn't feel like I was going to lose to anyone. I didn't feel like I was going to lose to anyone.
Bacho Saginashvili: uh during warm-up i had a little bit problem and on the competition on on super much uh after my hand get pumped i had a problem with pulling and also also i get a little bit injured and for a few months i i was curing this injury after after this match what what is his weight now
Host: 102 kg 102. so you both are meeting this is 105 kilos right yeah okay okay so at this way how does he feel does he feel just as strong or maybe better because he feels lighter and can move better
Bacho Saginashvili: I'm very comfortable in this weight and I'm also planning to lose a few kilograms before match. This will give me more explosive power and more speed.
Host: Gotcha. Gotcha. So does this weight, this is his, he believes 105 kilo will be his class, or maybe he will want to go for a higher weight class.
Bacho Saginashvili: I will compete in 105, but I'm also planning to go in 95. Mostly I plan to go in 95. Okay. Okay. So you're keeping, you're going to keep a big eye on the championship match, Todd Hutchings versus Irakli. Yes, yes. I'm very interested in what will happen there.
Georgi (Translator/Helper): I want to ask you about Brad Grandi. What can you tell me? What do you know about bread? I don't know anything about bread. I don't know anything about bread. I don't know anything about bread. I don't know anything about bread. I don't know anything about bread. I don't know anything about bread.
Bacho Saginashvili: First, when our match was set up, I didn't know who he was. But then I saw his matches, but I didn't get surprised with his performance. So I think it will be just a normal match for me. Nothing special or hard.
Bacho Saginashvili: So you don't see anything unusual in his style? Do you feel comfortable about your chances on beating him?
Bacho Saginashvili: i saw his uh pulling uh bullings and i saw that he is mostly in the top floor and in top floor he has no chance and if he goes in hook that's here here also don't change don't have a chance no chances for bread so you're good you're 19 or 20 now what is your age 20.
Host: 20 okay super young in the sport already making big splashes what what is your goal for 2025 for this year like what is your big goal
Bacho Saginashvili: In 2024, because of injury, I pulled just one time. So this year, I want to pull more. I will compete on European and World Championships. Also, if they remade me, I will also pull on East vs. West and King of Stables. So I want to pull more and more this year.
Host: okay but uh pulling is one so what is your goal like do you want to be top top five top ten guys fight for the championship or you feel like maybe you need a little bit more time how does he feel like what would be his next step after this match
Georgi (Translator/Helper): I think it's the same. I think it's the same. I think it's the same. I think it's the same. I think it's the same. I think it's the same. I think it's the same.
Bacho Saginashvili: in 95 I want to pull against and also everyone in top five I want to see myself against all those strong guys so human versus bio that would be very interesting very interesting very very tough challenge but I think bachelor looks like a guy who loves challenges
Host: Yes. So how was preparation for this? Tell us like your regular week, how much do you train? How often? And how do you schedule your training sessions?
Bacho Saginashvili: Yes, this is what I wanted to say. In the case of a normal query, I wanted to say that it is a very dangerous query. I wanted to say that it is a very dangerous query. I wanted to say that it is a very dangerous query. I wanted to say that it is a very dangerous query. I wanted to say that it is a very dangerous query.
Bacho Saginashvili: uh in a week i was training three four times last few weeks mostly i pulled on the table on moose and finally i think that i'm in very good shape okay where is your shape now maybe where you were versus reno how do you feel like do you feel like you're better stronger or
Georgi (Translator/Helper): around the same.
Host: uh before because of changing weight uh i did not use my full power with reno maybe just 50 or 60 percent so now i think the time way way better way way better that's a lot 50 60 that's a that's a lot i'll be very interested to see like what is how how it goes um about your opponent right what do you expect from him what do you think
Georgi (Translator/Helper): How does he try to beat you?
Bacho Saginashvili: This match will be easy match. I don't think that his arms will stop. It will be easy for me to beat him. If he tries to top roll me, that will be easy. If he tries to go and hook with me, that will be also easy for me. Feels like, yeah, Bakhshan doesn't lack any confidence. He looks ready. He looks strong.
Host: I'm looking at... Where is... Okay, maybe something with timings or something came up. We'll get Brent maybe later. Let's talk about the whole event, right? There's 11 amazing matches.
Host: and i want to hear his opinion on these matches so we we go straight away to stojan versus vasily so um does he know much about stojan
Bacho Saginashvili: In 2023, I pulled against Stoyan in World Championship. And during our pulling, he got injured, broke his arm or tendon. And in right hand, I did not pull with him. So I don't know his right hand. But in left hand, I did.
Georgi (Translator/Helper): What does he expect from... Is Vaso ready? Is Vasily ready? Vaso is ready. He is ready.
Bacho Saginashvili: With Vaso, I never pulled, but as he says, he's in very good shape, like in a good shape like never before. So I think he will win. But also, since I never pulled against him, I don't know his hand. I think 50-50. Okay. That's a very honest answer. I like that. I like that. We have another one. This is great. I love this match. Serhii Kalinichenko versus Frank Lamparelli.
Bacho Saginashvili: I think he knows both of these athletes. How does Bacho see this match? I know Kalinichenko very well. When I was in France, I met Kalinichenko and I think Kalinichenko will win this match.
Host: Yeah, right. Okay. I saw you guys a little bit pulling. Yeah. So how do you think, how does Kalina wins? How does Kalinichenko wins? Is it with a press, no wrist, or he doesn't even lose his wrist? What do you think?
Bacho Saginashvili: uh i don't think it will be very easy much uh i think he will go in top role but i don't think that he will lose his wrist okay okay um alex could that david that he can
Bacho Saginashvili: It's hard to predict this much. I saw that Gordechia gained a lot, and he's big now. But also, Dadikyan is looking bigger, and he has good wrist and side pressure. So it's also very hard to say who will win. It's also 50-50.
Host: Good matches if they're 50-50, I think. What is Bacho's left arm? Most people now, it's more interesting right arm, but where do you consider your left arm? Is it as good as right arm or what's the difference?
Georgi (Translator/Helper): Arun, what do you think about the fact that you lost the match? I think the match is over. What do you think about the fact that you lost the match? I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
Bacho Saginashvili: It's a little bit weaker than my right hand. But if I prepare for right and left hand much, I also cannot pull in the left hand. I feel wrong. Is it the same technique? Is it very similar? Or it feels a little bit different? On top roll, I can do better pronation with left hand.
Host: Better pronation with left arm. But wrist is right arm, right? Wrist is stronger. A little bit. Right wrist is a little bit stronger, but left is also very good. Okay. So if you get a left arm match, you wouldn't say no. You would say most likely yes, right?
Host: yeah it's stupid questions for me of course he would pull um we have one female match on the card and it's
Host: i would say two legends of female arm wrestling we have malin bankstrom versus fear isaac uh i don't know how much he knows but fear uh is the current i think three years in a row world champion and malin last time she won world title was 2019 and she really hasn't competed since but first time they pulled malin beat fear easily what can does he have any thoughts about this match
Bacho Saginashvili: I would like to say that I am very happy to be a part of this team. I have been a part of this team for 2-3 years and I am very happy to be a part of this team. I am very happy to be a part of this team.
Host: I don't know. I don't really watch female wrestling. That's absolutely honest answer. It's fine. It's fine. Daniel Prokopchuk, Oleg Zhokh, at 85 kilos.
Georgi (Translator/Helper): I think also 50-50. Engin chose the match very wisely. So it's very hard to say who will win because both are really strong.
Host: If let's say, how does, how does Prokopchuk win? Does it, it, does he see it as easy win or if he wins, it's insanely hard match.
Bacho Saginashvili: I would like to ask you, how do you feel when you hear the word Prokopchuk? Do you feel like you are in the middle of something, or how do you feel? I feel like I am in the middle of something. I don't feel like I am in the middle of something. I feel like I am in the middle of something. I feel like I am in the middle of something. I feel like I am in the middle of something.
Bacho Saginashvili: It will be a hard match for Prokopchuk. It will not be easy win if he wins. I think mostly inside pressure because if Prokopchuk tries a top roll, it will be very hard for him to beat. Okay. We have another Georgian champion versus very strong Ukrainian. We have Oleg Petrenko, but Kylian Ianni. Okay. How does he see that match?
Georgi (Translator/Helper): Yes, it is very important to be able to do it. It is very important to be able to do it. It is very important to be able to do it. It is very important to be able to do it. It is very important to do it.
Bacho Saginashvili: it's also hard to predict but uh that Kelly has very uh good endurance and I think that this match will stop and there will be fight uh so the the one who has more endurance will win so that Kelly will win this match okay uh I I ask everyone do you think we will see but Kelly smiling in this match
Host: yes i think everyone should put money on it you know if it will happen yeah this is like and i think for you this is very interesting mats we have uh iraqli versus todd hutchings
Georgi (Translator/Helper): I don't know how to pronounce it.
Georgi (Translator/Helper): After all the matches, I had a problem with my health. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to do.
Bacho Saginashvili: I think he also had weight problems when he was in 105, when he lost last time against Dadikyan. And after, when he lost his weight in 75, 95, he beat everyone. So I think this match will be also very easy for him. The style of Todd Hutchings, do you think it causes any problems? Because he's excellent of dealing versus top rollers.
Georgi (Translator/Helper): There is a problem with the style of the music, because the style of the music is very different from the music of the past. I don't know how to describe it. I don't know how to describe it. I don't know how to describe it. I don't know how to describe it.
Bacho Saginashvili: Last time when they pulled in 105, Irakli opened Todd's wrist, but he was not able to finish him. But now he has strong wrist and also very strong side pressure. So I think Irakli is still... If you go down to 95 kilos and they say you can pull for the title, which one of these guys you rather pull? Would you pull Irakli or would you pull Todd Hutchings?
Bacho Saginashvili: So do you believe you could beat Hutchings now? At this moment, I don't know. But if I prepare against him, especially, I think I can beat him.
Bacho Saginashvili: OK, that's like that's one of the matches I would love to see because he's literally three times older than you.
Host: Vasily yesterday said that with old guys, you should never stop. You should be first because if they stop, they're really strong. So I think it goes also with Todd Hutchings and everyone kind of knows it. .
Georgi (Translator/Helper): Devon vs. Genadi. How does the rematch go? Let's talk about this one.
Georgi (Translator/Helper): It's not like that Genadi didn't have that. He had a machine and a machine. He had a machine and a machine. He had a machine and a machine. He had a machine and a machine.
Bacho Saginashvili: When they pulled last time, nobody was expecting that Genadi to win, but Genadi pulled very well. And Devon had, on a final time, Devon has a breeze problems also. So since now Genadi accept this match, I think he's prepared well and he will win the game.
Georgi (Translator/Helper): He will win. He feels like Genadi is the favorite.
Bacho Saginashvili: That will be also tough match but I think that Kennedy with his good endurance and his fighting spirit and style that he can change his movement during the match quickly, his strategy, he can change his strategy very quickly and with his endurance he will beat again.
Host: so so how does he thinks uh Genadi wins does Genadi uh goes you know flock with press like the last time or he beats him in a hook like how if he closes his eyes how does he see the match I think with full of twist and with press
Georgi (Translator/Helper): Flopper's press. Okay, that's... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I could definitely see that. But do you guys see... You see a war or you see an easy victory for Genadi? Do you think Genadi will win? I think he will win. I think he will win because he is a legendary sportsman.
Host: they are both legendary athletes so it will not be easy much there will be a big war big war okay um can you maybe like i think bacho has seen the things that devon has said should devon be more more calm down there because uh and watch what he says maybe maybe bacho has some advice how to act in georgia
Bacho Saginashvili: I would like to ask Devon to tell us a little bit about this year's videos. Do you think that Devon will be able to go back to Georgia and return to Georgia?
Bacho Saginashvili: I think he must be a bit afraid because Georgian supporters will be close to us and their support will help us on the table and we will perform better and they will be with us. I'm more afraid of... I know support will be there but
Host: I'm more afraid what might happen if Devon starts calling Genadi his dog like he did. I don't know what will happen. Yes, I know. Last time press conference they had Devon said let's make a bet and whoever wins
Host: Whoever loses has to tattoo the flag or the other country on the face. And I said to David, you missed it. You had two tattoos now, but he has just one. Yeah.
Host: Yeah. There's one really big match. I think this might be the biggest match on the card for implications as someone, the winner will get to pull Levan, right? We have Ermes versus Michael Todd.
Georgi (Translator/Helper): I think Ermes is in very good shape, and I think that Ermes will win easily. Easy? You think? I think, yes, it will be easy match. I think that Mike Todd is also in very good shape, but Ermes is different level.
Host: okay okay so he definitely watched the match versus Genadi and Michael Todd where does he believe Genadi made the biggest mistake in the match
Georgi (Translator/Helper): What do you think will happen to Genadi and his family? Genadi will have a new family, and Trump will come to power. I don't think he will be able to do that.
Bacho Saginashvili: I think that Kennedy lost because he comes after injury and I think that physically he was not very strong at that time. That's why he lost, I think. Okay, so it feels like he wasn't ready, yeah. Then the question is, how does Bacho think, like, from Ermes and Michael Todd, who can give a better match to Levan?
Georgi (Translator/Helper): I would like to ask you about Ermes or Michael? Ermes. I would like to ask about Ermes. I would like to ask you about Ermes. I would like to ask you about Ermes.
Host: We already saw what happened when Levan and Ermes pulled. He gave Levan a good fight. So I still think that Ermes can give a good fight and he's now in better shape. Okay, okay. Does Bacho think can... Do you think anyone in like next two, three years can do something with Levan? Or does Levan is like levels beyond everyone else?
Bacho Saginashvili: He's another level, so I don't think that someone can beat him. He's almost don't feel his opponents. He beats everyone very easy, so he will win again.
Host: what makes him so special it's of course he's big but in bachos like is is there something special about levin in his own mind how does he see it
Georgi (Translator/Helper): What do you think, what do you think about this concept? Genetics, in our country, if there is no genetics, it is not possible to do anything, because genetics is a form of work.
Bacho Saginashvili: In our sport, I think that genetic and hard work is the main things. So Lewand has both of them. He has very good genetics. Without genetics, in our sport, it's very hard to achieve something and hard work also. OK. So I feel like you also have really good genetics. Everyone thinks like this.
Bacho Saginashvili: How does he feel? Does he feel gifted in a sport? Yes, I think that I have good genetics because from the early childhood in school, I was beating everyone. Because I remember in Worlds when he was like 15 years old, he was already crazy strong, right?
Host: When I was 15 years old, I already won World Championship. Yeah, that's how impressive you are, for sure. Malin, it's going to be very exciting to see you pull and grow in next years. The main event of the car is Vitalii Laletin versus Artem Morozov.
Bacho Saginashvili: If most people you will ask to, everyone kind of counts out Morozov. What does he do?
Georgi (Translator/Helper): Those are very strong athletes, but I think that Laletin will win because Morozov's wrist will open. In top role, Laletin will win. What does he feel? If Vitalii wins,
Host: Is there anyone that can beat Vitalii on left arm? I think Alijan. Alijan. That's a good match, right? Alijan has been incredibly impressive. I want to ask also, Bacho, give me your three favorite armorsers
Bacho Saginashvili: Your favorite, three favorite harvesters. First, Levan. Of course. You're happy I didn't say five.
Host: It's really hard to say. Maybe style, maybe something he likes, maybe something they do really good. In childhood, I liked. But not anymore or still.
Bacho Saginashvili: When I was a child, I was thinking that Putnik was the strongest arm wrestler in the whole world, but then I realized that he was not very strong. Poor Putnik, poor Putnik. Yeah.
Host: and and give me give me third one what else i understand i understand like 11 i understand prudnik i also understand because prudnik was great he could pull inside outside great endurance explode everything right he's great armor sir but give me number three who well they won't let them learn
Host: okay okay so it's so why devon learned he's already old but he's still very strong and he's funny funny okay good good good uh what does he think devon um was pulling at 105 kilos and like
Host: He beat Petrenko extremely easily, in my opinion. In the 115, we saw the same versus Prudnik. Is Devon the strongest guy if he comes down to weight at 105, 115 kilos? What does Bacho think?
Bacho Saginashvili: Yes, that's right. If you want to be a professional athlete, you have to be a professional athlete. You have to be a professional athlete.
Bacho Saginashvili: are a lot of athletes when they lose weight they lose power also but he's different uh athlete when he lose weight he has still very good power so i don't think that anybody can beat uh if you lose in uh 95 it will be interesting uh him against uh iraq oh no he can't do 90 come on that's too much he's now he's now 135
Bacho Saginashvili: i was also not expecting that he would lose in 105 but he was able to lose weight yeah yeah but did he expect uh devon's match versus petrenko to go like that absolutely dominated by by devon
Georgi (Translator/Helper): Petrenko is good in hook. And it could be really hard to hook Larratt. So from the beginning, I was thinking that Larratt would be easy.
Host: Hmm. Gotcha. Gotcha. So from from all the matches that are going to happen right now, which is what do you think is going to be the best match on the card on East versus West 16? Is it going to be your match versus Brad? And one match every day. That's sorry. So when was the same day? So it's just from the league. You need to be able to do it.
Host: uh my bread match will be very easy so not very interesting but who does he believe will be the best match yes i i think arm wrestling and what happens on the stage can be two separate things right
Host: Yeah, because Genadi will not step down. He will continue going for sure. Same as Devon. So like you said, it's going to be definitely a great, great event. Yeah. Can you...
Host: We all the time have people starting armwrestling. You're very young, yet you're very good. Do you have maybe advice you could give to any beginner starting armwrestling right now? What helped you the most in the sport?
Georgi (Translator/Helper): Genetic is very important, but genetic without hard work is nothing. So hard work is very important and you must train hard to achieve something in armwrestling. Does Bacho see armwrestling as a big part of his life?
Host: it's like for me it's always like young guys that are extremely talented and you think like you're 19 20 years old now and we have todd hutchings that close to 60 and john brzenk still pulling so you have 40 years ahead of you so do you see it as like okay
Bacho Saginashvili: have time i have a lot of time or you still you want to go really fast and hopefully you want to get to the top really really fast
Host: I think I have a long, big time and I don't want to rush. I want to go slowly, not to get injured. That's very smart. That's very smart. Yeah. So like his opponent, like Reno, would you want to get that rematch versus Reno one more time or you're not looking for that match anymore?
Georgi (Translator/Helper): There will be very much for sure. And it will be bad for Reno. It will be bad for Reno. Very good. Very good. Low fire. Very nice. Very nice.
Host: what we need so brad is coming on in a few minutes so i think i messed up or he messed up with times doesn't matter he's gonna come on we're gonna take you guys for a little bit here i'll try to get brad talk to you and then you can guys leave and i'll keep on talking with with brad if that's okay can you please translate that
Bacho Saginashvili: Maybe Batro can tell me, from all the armistice right now in Georgia, who are giving him the biggest problems? How does he feel like?
Bacho Saginashvili: um i don't know everyone is very strong in georgia but i cannot say one name yeah i feel like you have great like level in georgia is extreme like
Host: Probably the highest it can be anywhere like the competition level is crazy. This is why you have so many great athletes I want to hear his thoughts about david samushi Because david is kind of a little bit underrated people kind of look down like because he's he doesn't talk much He doesn't share much things. But what does bacho think about him? Hey, hey brad. Hey Hey guys, can you guys hear me?
Brad Grundy: yeah i'm sorry i i think i messed up with times and send that message and it kind of confused you a little bit yeah it's fine it's no worries you know funny enough i was actually dreaming about bacio i was sleeping because i'm in exams i was uh dreaming about basho our match and dude i lost
Host: Lots of magic in my dreams. Sometimes dreams come in reality. Yeah, very clever, Bacho. Yeah, very clever. Didn't see that one coming. Listen, I've been talking with them. How about anything you want to ask with Bacho, I'll leave you for, like, you can do it, and then I'll let the guys go and we talk a little bit more. Okay. Hey, do you have, can you guys hear me all right? Yeah. Yeah.
Brad Grundy: Okay. Yep. Questions for Bacho. Whatever you want to. Yes. Yes. From you. What's your favorite color? Black. Black. Of course. Okay. What's his full name? What? Full name. What's his full name? What's his full name?
Host: OK, what's the what's the flying weight of a swallow? OK, that's that's enough bread. Thank you. Those are great questions. Great questions. So I had a good conversation with him. He said I asked him, like, which match will be great, like the best match on the card. And he said your match will not be that because he will beat you very easily. OK, that's that's what I expected to hear, really.
Brad Grundy: Yeah, it's not super surprising. But yeah, it's great to see Boccio. Can I ask Boccio, does Nugo and him, who wins out of that dynamic? Nugo and Boccio win. Nugo and Boccio win.
Bacho Saginashvili: We do a lot of sparring during trainings, but when we get rest on a competition or somewhere, we never pull, so I don't know. Okay. So nothing, no... There's no... Are they close? I cannot say. I don't know. Because Nugo told me, once you beat Bacho, you can fight me.
Host: Well, you know, maybe at one day, one day, you guys can pull Devon because Nugo beats him every single time. I am not pulling Devon anytime soon. Have you seen that guy? Yes. Thank you. No, thank you. Right. He had to post his weight because you let the cat out of the bag. You guessed it.
Host: I guessed it, yeah. I felt like my screen just shut down, you know, sit in a little bit lower because I felt the weight of him. So while I have you both here, I want to see, I want to ask, like, Bacho, do you think Brad will get to the straps or no straps?
Bacho Saginashvili: That will be easier than when I beat Adam. So he will not go in struck. It will finish very fast. It will finish very fast. But Brad is a little bit bigger than Adam, for sure. He's bigger than Adam. I'm really just fat array. I'm not that much bigger.
Host: It doesn't matter for me. It doesn't matter. He was extremely confident, like he is, and stoic, as Georgians are. Yes. Yeah. Ray, I think in the great words of Ryan Bowen, I'm not going to even be sleeping with him. He's going to be sleeping with me, OK? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. OK, you can translate. So about your memory.
Host: did he translate the ryan bone part or does he just think i'm delusional yeah well okay i i asked like uh macho feels confident that there's no chance you can you cannot top roll him and you cannot get in the fuck with him
Host: you guys you guys talk less if if you're both from eastern europe what do you want me to say he's wrong like there's not really much comment there he's not giving me any wiggle room to even understand he's just too strong for me yeah so he's getting bored here okay
Host: Thank you, guys. You guys can leave. We're going to stay here with Brad. One last question. Has he seen Bacho Libre or no? We cannot hear your voice very well. Has he seen Bacho Libre? What? Bacho Libre. Bacho Libre. You know that photo that he posted? We have also a photo for you. You can see here.
Host: is this really bad quality i can't see it i can't see it what is he doing oh i'm ramsey okay
Host: Okay, okay, gotcha. The quality is bad, but we can figure it out. Yes, yes, yes. Nice. We will post so you can see. Thank you, thank you. Yes, yes. I'm excited to be on Ramsey's body. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Bacho. Thank you, Georgi. You guys can jump off. I'm going to stay here with Brad, and I'll see you guys in Tbilisi. Goodbye. Bye, guys. Perfect.
Host: okay all right we're still live i'm sorry man like i i sent that message and i think like 1 p.m but for some reason i added an hour there and i was like you're gonna be on one p.m that's why i replied with my message like oh yeah 326 just to like make sure you didn't misread it and you were just like okay i was like sure
Host: Because you cut a few minutes off and I thought like, oh, just I'm going to send you the link a few minutes early. So, yeah. I'm in exam week, so I was sleeping the whole time. I just woke up. Yeah. Anyway, man, big match. I heard a lot of different things and I even asked Engin about it because I heard from Neil that you was asking for this match. But then I thought like maybe you asked for it before, but I think Engin just offered you this, right? Yeah, yeah.
Brad Grundy: And look, I had, I had a whole plan. Like I was hoping like three months dedicated to bot show, go to a bulk area, train with your ordinance of eight on, um, get everything dialed in. It hasn't been that, but it's been pretty good. So like Devon, uh, Paul Lynn, these are the guys I've been training with and really everything hasn't come together to like the last week, like this past week, I feel much, much better. Very good. Very good. Like, well,
Brad Grundy: Is his biggest threat that insanely big and strong hand? You know what? I'm not sure about that because a lot of times big hands hurt people. They have a hard time using it in any kind of like dynamic way. It becomes like a big thing, like a pitcher's mitt almost. I just go one way or the other. I'm more worried about his thumb to hand length a little bit.
Host: Have you seen, like, some guys have a big thumb to match it. His thumb is pretty far back. So that's probably the biggest worry for me. So you're, yeah, because you're both going to be fighting for that height. Yeah, even if I want to go inside, it's nicer to have more purchase on the hand. Yeah, of course. So for you, how difficult do you think this is going to be?
Brad Grundy: I think it's my hardest match so far, right? Like Matt was not a joke. No. And my shape for Matt was perfect. I had no school during the time, so I was literally like sleeping 10, 11 hours a day in arm wrestling at 8 or 9. It was just like completely focused. I think this will be the hardest ask for me ever. What you're studying? I'm still doing...
Host: was a pre-med so I'm still doing like organic chemistry and biochemistry and stuff like that okay okay so you're going to be doctor right that's the plan yeah that's the plan Dr Brett Dr that's pretty nice pretty nice it's gonna be it's gonna be tough like doctors have it like for a reason right it's so you have to know and then you have to kind of go to
Brad Grundy: that doesn't matter it doesn't matter it's just tough I think uh I applaud those people we need those people you know so idiots like me can get injured and then you help me uh and dude really right now like I've talked to so many doctors that like there's this weird thing with like YouTube where everyone's on YouTube anyway like most your injuries are almost better off going to YouTube if you know like the right channels to go to
Brad Grundy: Like so many of these old timey doctors have no idea how to deal with sports injuries at all. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I think once AI becomes more prevalent, so I actually went to Guatemala and I was teaching their EMTs with AI because I don't speak Spanish. So I left after two weeks. I was like, hey, if this is when you give an IV, this is like if you ever have any questions, you ask the AI and it'll tell you because like, hey, look, it's not perfect. But when I was there,
Brad Grundy: We had a car accident with a lady with a messed up neck and they were trying to get her blood sugar. And she's like borderline, like going to die. And they don't know when to do certain operations. So like they would do blood sugar for everyone, whether they were shot or like in a bad car accident. And they'd be like, oh, she might be diabetic. And I'd be like, dude, who cares? We have to take her to the hospital. Yeah.
Host: Okay, okay. Listen, man, maybe your phone is resting somehow. The audio is a little bit too low. Like, I hear you perfect, and if I check the stream, it's perfect, but people are complaining like this. Okay. Is this better? I don't know. For me, it was fine before. Brad yelled, I can't hear you.
Host: If I put it on, like, when we talk, like, okay, my mic is way bigger because it's a professional mic, but I think for some reason. Can they hear me? Yeah. The audio cuts out every three seconds. Okay, I'm just going to use my phone.
Host: Yeah. Listen, I heard you were retired. Then you unretired yourself. What's going on? Let me log into my phone. I'm on my computer. I'll try to fix it.
Host: okay okay no problem so he's going to leave us for a second guys and yeah it's the settings you need to adjust in stream settings there we go to me oh this is the way one of me will get it through the volume yes yes i'm going to remove this one this is this is so much better so much better yeah and they also had like a computer very low audio there so i always the bots are not hear anything i said
Brad Grundy: No, I think they maybe, maybe, maybe. For me, it's fine, but I don't know. I have maybe a better setup or something. Okay, let me actually go outside real fast. But hey, yeah, I feel pretty good. The med school stuff is a lot, and I'm still just doing pre-med. It's not even med school, but I'm finding a good balance. Okay, that's good. I figured it's because of the school and everything else.
Brad Grundy: Yeah, and then my back's fine now, which is awesome. Yes, I have nothing. It's just school and arm wrestling is my whole life. That's not bad. That's not bad if you can find a balance with it, right? Yeah. So how excited are you going to Georgia? Have you been to Georgia? No, I've never been to Georgia, yeah. It's not a very popular destination spot here in America. Yeah.
Brad Grundy: But I'm super excited. I heard great people. I've heard great food. The weather's going to be nice, I think. What is it, like 20, 30? No? Like 8, 6, 8. Oh, you're Celsius, right? Celsius, yeah. OK, OK. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. OK. So closer to the zero than the other way around. Yeah. That's not too bad, though.
Brad Grundy: I'm a little annoyed. I had to leave. I would like to leave like Sunday, Monday and be there. I have to show up Wednesday just because of school. So weight cutting on the airplane is going to be fun. How is your weight now? It's like 252 in the morning, 253. So good. It's already there. It's already there. Okay. 20 pounds, water cut, yeah. 20 pounds, water cut, like nothing.
Host: i i weigh like two la 250 man so i mean like for you it's much harder for me it's it's not too bad someone someone made a joke when i said like you know like oh you know it's hard to cut this weight like we're made 96 more or something like that sure i'm not sure about that yeah yeah uh
Brad Grundy: For Bacho, you said you trained with Devon, you trained with Paul Lynn, with some other guys. In your own mind, you have a good plan? Yeah, no, I've always had, I think, a good plan, which is why I wanted the match originally. It's just the... Obviously, the timing can always be better. I've had to, like, speed run the whole, like, get back into shape, run to Paul Lynn, run to Devon, because I was pretty out of shape, like, two and a half months ago or even less.
Brad Grundy: And I was doing stuff like I would still show up to practice and do like floppers pressing and hooking. So even like just getting my top roll back has been kind of a process of me like really figuring everything out. So I saw I wasn't too confident until this past week. Actually. I was at Devon's place and I was slowly getting my tech I was getting stronger the more we practiced. My technique was getting back and back. Yeah.
Host: very good that's very good because like when you wanted this match when you kind of were gunning for this match law but what did you saw that everyone else avoided it no no one really wanted to pull super strong georgian kid you know what in our uh if we have a post post match interview i'll tell you i don't want to say anything too crazy before yeah okay hopefully i i saw something actually there and not just an illusion we'll see though
Host: okay so he he told me i asked him like vitrino match and he believes he was trying to get weight uh bigger for that match uh and then he feels like he wasn't himself he didn't and he said he felt like he was like 60 of himself on that day like percentages are always crazy and when people say like 60 90 years like how do you know right uh
Brad Grundy: But what do you expect from him? Do you expect him to be really, really, really strong? Like, what level of strength do you think he will be? I think the strength won't be too far off with Reno. I think his explosiveness will be much better. He missed the go with Reno's match. They both, like... Yeah, and you were commentating. You were like, they both missed the go. They both missed the go, and they're both, like, double-double. Yeah, I think if he'd had a good start, he could have won that first one and maybe the second one.
Brad Grundy: But since he started slow with Reno, Reno could find his little spot. And Reno really has a hard style for Boccio. But, yeah, I think Boccio is definitely going to be coming just right here for me. Okay. Okay. So I have two options. I can either know he's coming at me and come over, right? Yep. And kind of just try to take the pronator, let him come to me. Or the second option would be to try to do some kind of outside move. Mm-hmm.
Brad Grundy: okay okay okay so that that's what you've been working on with with devon and paul and pauline yeah i made sure so paul is i think like the best hooker we have here in america and paul is really good paul is like crazy strong his hand though is just so different from bacho like paul is a little hand um that was a bit awkward to try to simulate like he's trying to get deeper on me and i'm trying to like shove into him um simulate the pressures and stuff but yeah gotcha
Host: I feel like you did all the homework you needed to do and will come down to execution and where the balance of the strength lies, right? Yeah. I think Bacho is impressive for many reasons, but he was like, there's a lot of people that are, few people that are gifted and he was very gifted from the young, right? He was like 14, 15, 13, already insanely strong.
Host: he definitely has good coordination and so like he says genetics he's like man if you have genetics like they they help yeah all the georgians seem to have crazy genetics i don't know what it is something in the water over there listen first of all like when you go to uh like like juniors or youth classes 1823 and you look guys with full beards at 16 and yeah the genetics pick in early for them
Brad Grundy: Yeah, they mature super early, for sure. This will be first time, like it will be very hostile audience. Do you think so? I don't think so. I mean, for Devon, yeah, because Devon's going to be a jerk about it. I'm a pretty nice guy, I feel like, so I feel like they're not going to have any issue whether I beat Bacho or not.
Host: yeah yeah yeah i actually i hope i go before devin just to kind of placate the crowd a little bit i i think i think yeah i think you will have well devin's asking to go first or something i want i want to go first so i can enjoy the whole event yeah i just i i can't imagine what's going to happen with devin because he will cross the line whatever the line is whatever the line is in people's minds he will cross it right i know yeah
Brad Grundy: But it's going to be fine. It's always fine. Malin, let's talk about some of the other matches on the card. Do you have your favorite? I mean, Army's Michael is a really fun match to watch just because there's so much into that. There's history. There's emotion. There's also, like, the unknown factor. Like, Michael really is an unknown to me.
Brad Grundy: like somewhat suspect with gennady's injury um but he could just really be that good so i don't know some part of me sees like the frank who gave michael a hard time and part of me sees like michael did be gennady um but it's hard to say that's really good i will quote i will quote aramis but you know this wrist is like but yeah
Brad Grundy: i've heard i've heard once army's wrist goes it is like done for like some guys they lose their wrists and they're like crack crack cracks that's what i heard about armies so i mean over the course of three rounds i wouldn't be surprised yeah he could like he he lost his wrist versus 11 but if he loses to michael it's not going to be the same position you can't hold michael like that no no not at all um
Brad Grundy: Yeah, and I think Armys has those wrists where it's like a rock, where as soon as it cracks, it is like out of commission forever. So I think Michael definitely has a chance. Except for that, though, Fia and Malin is a great match. Do you have Fia or Malin? You know these guys better than I do, our girls.
Host: I have slight edge to the active champion, but it's close because Malin is a kryptonite to Fia and she knows her so well and she has that speed and blocks the history. But Malin hasn't been active since 2019, like really active on like high level competition and Fia has been beating everyone. And I have pulled with both of them. In some positions, Fia feels insane, like insane.
Host: yeah but marlin just has that high flashing topical right yes yeah which just probably so fia like she's her hand is so strong that she doesn't care she doesn't fight for the grip or anything she just takes and just just nothing sometimes no one gets to the strap anywhere or something but if you do it with malin she just explodes over you like
Brad Grundy: Okay, so kind of like me and Bacho a little bit. Could be, could be. Yes, yes, yes. But it's definitely a good one. What else? Except for that, I think Devon Genadi is going to be a lot of fun to watch, I think. I think Devon kills the guy. I train with Devon, and I pulled him before he pulled Ermes. There's like a significant, like maybe, like definitely one level, but maybe like even more than that jump from where he was with Ermes.
Brad Grundy: Like, a huge jump in power. Like, I talked to Portshop. We have never felt him this strong. It's, like, insane. I think, like, if you told me he was to pull LeVon, I would actually put money on Devon this time. I've never put money on Devon. I would for this time. Really? Yes. Really? And everyone's going to think I'm crazy in the chat, but... No, it doesn't matter. Like, don't make me a believer again. Like, it's, you know, like, every time... I'm already a believer. I'm already...
Host: What we get every year for Easter. Right? Everyone's like, come on. I think someone called Brett. He's still there. Oh, dude. Nugo's asking for my screenshots. So I think he wants them. Okay, okay. Nugo's trying to get a match now, right now. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
Host: probably shouldn't have told botcher that it's not very nice of me you don't have to be done yeah what is your favorite match though right i like nugo a lot so i feel kind of bad for doing that yeah i i have like five matches there but it's like i think uh adamus and michael canadi and devon iraqli and todd yes yeah yeah what what what do you think about that right
Host: I have taught. Yeah, I have taught a hundred percent stylistically because yeah, it's the same thing's going to happen. I think like the exact same thing. Yeah. I feel like it actually might do better.
Host: But the things that, like, if it actually beats him, blows through him, I'll be like, dude, like, different level for sure, right? But I have to see him. Like, I have to see him because Todd is the best at shutting down top rowers. Probably the best. I think the only thing that would convince me if it's a Rackley waiting at, like, 106, 107 kilo after, like, he cut the weight and you had this massive Rackley. But he's not, yeah. He's just a 95-pound dude. Yeah.
Host: yeah he used so he was less than i think on every single match at 105 kilos he was less than the limit yeah yeah so i think he's gonna be like the exact same weight if not less than last time right and todd's gonna be the exact same as well
Host: you know what i was thinking today and what do you think so we used to when we pick matches and pick winner of the matches we used to look at you know like i would think like oh this guy is stronger he beat this guy because of this guy and now it all we kind of because of super matches most of the things just went out to the door and most important thing is the styles
Host: It's just like, you know that, right? Yes. But, but styles at some point, they didn't play that much of a difference when you talk like, you know, because the guys were like, Oh, you know, like, like this guy's so strong. It doesn't matter what kind of style you throw at him. Right. But I think it kind of started playing bigger part now because it used to be tournaments that we were looking at most of the time and statistics from tournaments and everyone could beat everyone for two times.
Brad Grundy: can they beat them three times, right? And you're not prepping for one opponent in a tournament, so it's definitely a different setting. I was lucky enough, I was in Korea when I started, and I actually, I beat their champion eight months into the sport, but I would have lost to the next 10 guys down. Like literally, everyone in the top 10 there, I would have lost to except for their champion.
Host: i've trained for it like perfectly he was a king's mover um so for me i've always felt very strongly about that like very strongly yeah yeah i feel like we're seeing this more and more i also think that armistice are recognizing it more and more because there's like there's there's kryptonites for every style every single style has a kryptonite right and then you have to yeah what is the adjustment and then i feel like
Brad Grundy: this kind of thinking also makes sport better and bigger because you have to think you can be just one move guy, right? No, a hundred percent. I mean, whenever you can take something like you can take strength away and you can replace it with a technique and intellect and I would say, um, dedication, then it's always a good thing because it's easy to train for strength. The hard part is like really thinking about the sport and like changing your body to be a certain way or like,
Brad Grundy: all the little things that you don't want to do. You want to just train weights and go hard, but to really slow down and do that kind of stuff is much more important, in my opinion. Yes, yes. I'm there with you. Everyone kind of has one opinion about this match. It's Vitalii versus Morozov. Well, dude, I saw a poll of me and Bacho's match, and it was the same. It was like 90-10. They were both 90-10. It's, yeah. I'd like to be on Morozov's side, but I also think Vitalii's going to beat him.
Brad Grundy: Yeah. Do you think it's stylistically because of the style? I'm not sure if Morozov is like top three, really. I think Camille left hand, we give him a hard time. I think Alizen beats him and I think Vitalii beats him. So I like Morozov a lot, but I don't think he's the same level as Vitalii. I think left arm, if we start playing around it's like open.
Host: very interesting because i feel like camille could be big problems if he gets better to everyone maybe except to alicia because of alicia's style he's fast jumps in right i think shanko will always beat him too yes i feel like yes even could definitely like he needs he needs that hook you can't beat those guys without the hook right i mean even beating yvonne with a hook i don't see it happening um
Brad Grundy: I'm actually a big believer in just having one or maybe like a finisher move, like one move and a finisher, and that's it. I don't believe in having two moves because there's no way your body can't do two different things to the highest level it needs to. If you're a flop presser, that's a hard ask because that is your finisher move as well. And once someone figures it out, it's definitely hard. But I don't think Camille is going to be hooking it on, no.
Host: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree. And if someone comes at you, you're running out of options there. Maybe develop a better press rather than a flopper's press. Yes, yes. But I wouldn't say a hook is the way to do it. Well, some kind of biceps connection he needs there because if someone supinates you, rotates you, you've got to end up there with the pressure on it.
Brad Grundy: I mean, it's going to stop Bogdan Stojko from beating them, but I don't think it's going to stop Ivan Mayushenko. Yeah, okay. That is true. That is true. Betkili and Petrenko. I have money on Betkili because Henry gave me odds, the reaction guy. Yeah.
Brad Grundy: But I think it's very close. I think it's, like, pretty much a 50-50. I think Bekele, though, it's a seven-round match, though, right? Seven rounds, yeah. I think that favors Bekele. So, yeah. He's pretty insane. But Petrenko, like, I think Petrenko probably gave one of the hardest matches to Alisson.
Brad Grundy: he did how i heard always almost a little off that day but how is petrenko with uh water cuts does he do water cuts or does he not even bother i think he can just diet himself down he doesn't bother that much okay that's a bad sign for petrenko in my opinion if you're dieting yourself down like you are going to lose stuff so yeah but kelly's probably the favorite in my opinion
Host: yeah coming down to his weight he has that endurance if he puts brakes on you you're just like you're running out all the options all the options so now the real the real question is and i'll involve you too little bit killy smile at any point in the match if we bet money on this i'll be screaming in the front like stupid georgian jokes trying to make him laugh but uh
Brad Grundy: No, I don't think there's any chance he smiles. Didn't you take my money in? I did. I did. You did. I think it was John Leonidas. You bet against John. You bet against the goat. No, no, no, no, no. That was a different match. Was it not? No, no, no. Someone bet me John Leonidas. Yeah, we bet on Sony, but I forgot on what. But yeah, I was like... It was 100 bucks, right? It was 20. It was 20. 20? Okay, okay. Yeah, I'm not rich American, you know? Sorry, my brain space is all just...
Brad Grundy: chemistry and biology and stuff now yeah um uh prokopchuk versus jock at 85 kilos um oh zoke easy that's like maybe the biggest mismatch to me in the whole car because prokopchuk's hand's so small and his arm's so short like to beat zoke you have to have that long hand long arm i think to uh stop his because his hand goes back isn't like his thumb is like
Brad Grundy: in a way different place than the hand. Yes. When you get strapped up, he's going to have nothing. He's going to have his hand like this. Yeah. So I don't see how he's winning that at all. Gotcha. Yeah. We talked about Theo Kurdecha versus Daddy Kian. I think Daddy can. You think Daddy can? I do, yeah. So he can. Yeah, not Daddy can't.
Brad Grundy: I do. Kurdecha is hard for me to analyze. He's so, I don't know. He's all over the place to me. So I think Kurdecha could like go one day, lose to Krasimir and then beat Ermes the next day. So he's a weird, weird person to analyze. But I think Daddy Kane would beat him.
Host: Okay, okay. Lefty, that's a good match. I feel like both guys could be definitely somewhere there in high, you know, high level with everyone else. The next match, I feel like this could be the match. This is Frank versus Serki. I love that match. People have been talking about me and Frank pulling for a long time, so I've studied him a lot.
Brad Grundy: I mean, we all think Frank's going to take the hand, right? And Sergey's going to flop. Frank's really bad at flopping, like really bad. So Matt pinned him with his flop, and I felt Matt's flop. It should not have been anyone at our level. So I would say Sergey's going to kill him. Unless he's really been dialed in for training against the flop, and he knows how to do the Reno stuff, or at least some kind of less back and more right over.
Host: I don't think he has a chance. I don't know how much Frank cares about arm wrestling. Yeah, that's a good one. Frank's ability to fight for the hand, that's incredible. I think he's really good there. He's lacking some things in his skill. He faced Michael, because he had a lot of time preparing for Michael. I said, did you prepare a press? He's like, no. I'm like, dude, like,
Host: and he could have won he was this close of winning that match right you know yeah yeah i know no go that match throws me off so much because michael is now facing ermys and frank is facing sergey and they had like a close close match yeah yeah right right yeah yeah armisen is awesome uh we have stoian and vasily do you know these guys or not really
Brad Grundy: Yeah, so actually, I got Vasily's name wrong in the last podcast I did, but Vasily, I watched him pull Herman Stevens, and he actually got flashed by Herman, kind of. He got fouled out. Then he beat John, I think it was at 4-2, back in the day. Yeah, something like that. I think he was flashing John out of the straps a lot. Mm-hmm.
Brad Grundy: So I think with East versus West, there's not going to be as much flashing out of the straps as WAF and stuff like that. So I think Stoyan has a much better chance. Everyone says Vasily is like his peak right now. Yes, that's what I'm hearing. I know, but Stoyan's camp hasn't said anything because he's like, who is this camp? Bulgarians. But do they even talk about their fellow athletes at all? No.
Brad Grundy: Yeah, so it's not even a fair comparison. Stoyan could be the best in his life, and we would never know. I think he might be, honestly. So I would say Stoyan's probably my slight favorite. Okay. I asked Stoyan how long has he been pulling. He said he started pulling in 1996. That's before I was born.
Brad Grundy: That's crazy. And Vasily started 10 years later, 2006. Okay. Well, he pulled John, I think it was in like, what was it? 10 or something? Like four years in the sport, he's already pulling John Brzenk and he beats him. So maybe he's the favorite. Yeah.
Host: I think it's like all of these matches and more. I look at them like, like all the time before the event, I have to meet the athletes and then I see them. And then you kind of can figure out like the, how they feel. Some, some people are very nervous. Some people just carry that nervousness around them and you feel like this will not. And then also behavior.
Host: you kind of tell a lot to tell so i'm excited to go there see you to see everyone else i think it's going to be just an epic time first time in georgia first time when it's not in istanbul or united states which is crazy right yeah it is crazy is it going to start happening where we have like italy us like these different locations or is it mostly going to just be us and turkey
Host: I think Turkey will be very, maybe once a year, maybe more, but it's going to be all over the world now. That's what I'm hearing. So that's awesome. And I think it's awesome. Right. I want to see if we can, I heard they already sold more tickets than ever before, which is craziness. So if we can get full, the place packed and it's going to be awesome. Brad, thank you. I apologize about the times, you know, it's a time difference is a,
Host: mff uh yeah that wasn't a time difference thing that was just three hours and 30 minutes yeah okay yeah i forgive you right yeah thank you guys for watching uh brett grandy bachelor second surely don't miss it live on east versus west 60. this don't don't yet go up never hold it from the bottom never hold it on the bottom yeah thank you guys bye
Host: okay thank you so much thank you so much i'm sorry i messed it up oh you're fine you're fine i think it worked out fine the microphone was a bit annoying but that's it's not a big deal it was worse but they had like really really bad uh cameras they had really bad and audio also so we missed all the monty python jokes and the nacho libre stuff
