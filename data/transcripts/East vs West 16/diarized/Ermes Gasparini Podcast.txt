Host: And we are here today with my good friend, Ermes Gasparini, Italian gladiator. It's always great to see you. Me too, my friend. Hello, everybody. Yeah, you are one of our superstars. And you know our nursing very well. And I'm your fan. I am one of your fans, yes. Thank you so much. Yes, you are very well-rounded athlete.
Host: and you are very complete. Okay, today I just shared a poster with Barbora and Gabriela and then Barbora just made a fire comment and then... What they wrote?
Host: Like Barbara put the command with the fire, you understand? And then I asked her, I just like to provoke, you know me, right? And I said, will she take your belt? I meant, will Gabriela take your belt? And she just answered me, of course not. I will come in my life form. This is going to be incredible. Some people don't understand or don't enjoy women arm wrestling, but
Host: Armwrestling is armwrestling. There are many great armwrestlers and these two are very strong. And Barbora said that if she wins this match, she wants to pull Ermes Gasparini next.
Ermes Gasparini: For sure, I can't wait to be very different. But I'm sure he won with many men. Many guys, yeah. Arm wrestlers, not normal men. Arm wrestlers. Arm wrestlers, a little bit lighter. Arm wrestlers. A little bit lighter but strong.
Ermes Gasparini: She's beating those 70 kilos, 75 kilo guys, 80 kilo guys. She's very strong. Yeah, incredible power. Yeah, I better not train with her unless I'm in good form. I hope Gabriela will be in very good shape because... Gabriela is strong? Yeah.
Host: I hope it will be a close fight. Barbara is really strong now. When they pulled first two rounds, Gabriela won. Then Barbara won three rounds after that.
Host: Let's see. Let's see how it will be, Ermes. Let's see how it will be. I believe they will be a great one. I have no doubt it will be a great one. And yeah, we already started, huh? We already started talking. Ermes, in my opinion, like if you look at for like one match, two matches is okay, different. But if you look at the whole card, right now there are 10 matches. And I think that this is the best card.
Ermes Gasparini: Or the King of the Table? For the King of the Table, I've never seen many, many matches that are super interesting like this. Yes, yes, yes. Really fantastic. I can't wait to see it. Yeah, we will just see it. You know what would be great?
Ermes Gasparini: Maybe we will watch together. Ah, I wanted to say this, because we will be in Italy. I may be coming to Italy. Yeah, yeah. Before my girlfriend, she said to me, told me, this weekend there is this event. Yes, you will come, right? You will come to Italy, right? Yeah, for sure.
Host: Yeah, for sure. We will organize how to see. With Risa, we will see. Risa, you know, Italian armwrestling owes him. This guy is just... Mohamed.
Host: Yeah, he's just riding the whole time. Hello, hello, hello, hello. Three million times, hello. I don't know why they do this kind of things, you know. Anyway, so I don't know if there is no moderator there. That's interesting. Yeah, wow. There's one, yeah. GP is there. Benji is there, yeah. And yeah, so yeah, Italian arm wrestling really owes a lot to Risa. Risa is like...
Ermes Gasparini: He really served Italian armwrestling a lot. And it's not because he's my friend, but if you see the quality of the tournament, it's really very good. Super match. He loves armwrestling. He loves armwrestling. That's why. And the place is a super amazing place.
Host: Yeah, I mean, we have matches, Jerry Cadoret, Levan Bacho Saginashvili, Brian Shaw, Eddie Hall, Gabriela Vasquez-Solos, Barbara Baggiova, Sandra Sedis, Rustam Bavev, Dave Chaffee, Gabor Botta, Dukat, Lachlan Eder, Lars Rohrbakken, Matt Mask, Marcio Barbosa, Corey West, Tobias Frank, Paul Link, Rasimir Kostadinov, Kevin Palco, Joseph Maranto. Let's start from Kevin Palco and Joseph Maranto.
Host: Kevin Palco, I know him. I think he's the training partner of Tata Shinks and he has huge forearms. I think he's very powerful, lightweight. His opponent, I don't know him, but I heard he's top 10 ranked in North America. I don't really have any opinion about this match. Do you?
Ermes Gasparini: No, but the next match. Maybe for sure this is a good stage to see this guy. Maybe they will do a good fight to see him in another event. Yeah, I agree. And so if we go to the next one, that is a very, very interesting one.
Host: That is very, very interesting one. Paul Lim versus Krasimir Kostadino. They both had a win against Lachlan. Paul won against Lachlan more convincingly, while Krasimir had some trouble with Lachlan.
Host: But we know that Krasimir is also a very, very experienced athlete. And this year he won the WAF. Krasimir, for sure, an international legend. You know, like in today's arm wrestling, like, you there? He's free. I don't know. You hear me? I hear you, but I don't see you. Maybe you get out and come back? Wait a moment. Okay. Okay.
Host: Hello, hello, hello. Hello, guys. How is everything? Okay. Ermes came and yeah, I kind of missed doing this podcast. And the king of the table is waiting for us. And that is no doubt. That is the best king of the table. Yeah. Welcome back. Yeah. So I'm just saying that like in today's world, everyone calls everyone legends. But the truth is that there are
Host: Not so many really legends, legends. Maybe the guys, they call them local legends or national legends, you understand? But when you talk about the globally legend, for sure, Krasimir Kostadinov is one of them. Do you agree with that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure, 100%. Yeah. This guy, I remember in 2016, he was 102 kilos. He competed in super heavyweights, and there,
Ermes Gasparini: He beat both Levan and Genadi there at the European Championships, and he was like, come on, man. Anyway, so how do you see this match? Pauline, Krasimir, it's incredible. For sure, Krasimir... Pauline, I think he has more explosive power than Krasimir. Krasimir...
Ermes Gasparini: I think at the power level maybe a little bit more Pauline, but I think Krasimir can adapt better than Pauline in the hook. Because Krasimir has super experience, he can use the shoulder in the hook,
Ermes Gasparini: to defend more. Pauline, he doesn't have a good defense in the hook. When you see, when he pulls it like with Baba, he pulls like with the open shoulder hook. And the Krasimir, the shoulder, he can put the elbow inside. You can have more endurance with this movement. Yeah, and Ermes, there is one guy, his name is Rich Allison. He says he's very sad.
Host: Can you make him happy by showing the baby? Oh, yeah, it's coming back. Wow. Wow. Yeah. Anyway. Yeah. So, Matt, they also said that we all are set. Now is everyone's everybody happy now? Yeah, everybody's happy. Yeah. Yeah. As you said, you know, but I was a bit favorite. Crazy mirror.
Host: It's because of the experience. Yeah. Okay, this guy worldwide says it. Hello, Engin. Rest in peace, Ermes. Why does he say rest in peace? Is it because you're going to lose to Michael or what? This will never happen.
Host: Maybe in another space, another universe. Another universe? Parallel universe? Maybe, maybe. Maybe, okay. But in real, okay, there is a super set. Emelian Mario says, hello guys, what is your favorite top roll exercise?
Ermes Gasparini: every every day i people ask me what is the best exercise for arm wrestling tell me one and what is this it's impossible to do that yeah you're right but if you choose one i would just say arm wrestling if only one like just think about it think about it you are in a room and
Host: they are asking you only one thing you can do it would you prefer a good arm exercise with the people or no no it's like one exercise just like table time is also exercise if you have to do only one then table is the best okay you know but if ah okay okay i i thought only with cable oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah if you can train
Host: With another guy, the best is with table time, for sure. See, voice of arm wrestling is here. He says, Raimon says it looks like there is no quality here. Quality. Just joking. Just joking. Okay. Henry says, thank you again for quality podcast. Henry, you know,
Host: know honey right yeah people people says that he is a paid actor while he came all the way from far america to pay to be a vip he paid me and then people says i pay him to do this you know that that's very interesting guy you know he likes the best you know he likes the best and anyways
Host: Anyway, so my friends, yeah, let's continue. But I will tell you something. In Orlando, I was surprised that when Rustam stopped Pauline, Pauline still fights very good. You understand? Normally he finishes or he cannot finish and then he loses. This time the match was tough. So Pauline also increased in his endurance within the match.
Ermes Gasparini: I think this match I heard from his sister, of Babaev, of Rustam. Sometimes he doesn't push it too much because he has a lot of scary to break another time. For me, Rustam really
Ermes Gasparini: A legend. He's a little bit down of John Brzezinski. Yeah, yeah, you're right. Maybe not a little bit, but a little bit more. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, Rustam really dominated this category. John Brzezinski was super heavyweight, but middleweight is Rustam, for sure. Yeah, yeah, he's incredible, for sure, yeah. He will be incredible, yeah. And, yeah.
Host: There is Peter Anchor says, hello, my friend. Can you ask Ermes his best top roll exercise? I think if you are alone with the cable pronation like this is the best one, I think. But listen, that is like, I mean, that are like, I'm curious why they want to know the best exercise.
Host: while there is nothing like this exercise here and the rest of the exercise here. No, you need all of them. You need all of them because if you just don't do one, we'll just think about a chain. You understand? Everyone is okay and then the one link is weak. It will just go . You need to do everything. Shoulder, your lat, your pronator, your brachioradialis, everything. Even for
Host: Top roll, I don't think you have only one exercise, but I think you like to do the one that you put in. You do this maybe. Is this your best? Yeah, I think this, if you need to choose only one, I will do this pronation and back pressure. Yeah. Anyway, so today, did you see Laletin's post, Gauntlet?
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. It will be very interesting to see more of it later. Yeah. Roman says Engin's video is good, but Ermes has better quality. Roman? Every time, every time. It's difficult to beat me about quality.
Ermes Gasparini: Okay, so do you think you will have that gauntlet? Invincible gauntlet? You will have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have it? When are you going to have
Ermes Gasparini: It's coming, okay. Okay, SGD De Galvez. Does Geri get a pin on Levan? Do you think that Geri will have one round? He's asking. This is super difficult to know. Because when you ask it to me, Geri and Kurdecha,
Ermes Gasparini: Everybody predicted that Kurdecha would win easy, and it was the opposite. Were you surprised? Super surprised.
Ermes Gasparini: I think that you beat Jerry because Jerry was ill. Otherwise, you couldn't beat him either. Yeah, only for this. But every time when they win or they are sick or they have some problem, I'm only lucky, my friend. Only lucky. You're only lucky. Yeah. But this is the life. Lucky is very important. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I think I really...
Ermes Gasparini: Jerry, if Lewand will do some mistake, one thing, if Jerry can pin Lewand one time, I think, or it will be like after 4-0, maybe super exhausted, or if it will be before 4-0, Jerry will win for sure. Yeah, but what if Lewand does something different, maybe?
Ermes Gasparini: Can I ask you something? Can I ask you something? Just say that Radical came and Jerry was so quick and he got this position and Levan is here. Who's winning the round? You need to be quick in the start. To center? Yeah, immediately. Because he will leave his wrist immediately with you. Yeah. Hello, Adnan.
Ermes Gasparini: I think I'm super curious to see this fight, really, because... So you are saying that if Lewandowski makes a mistake, there will be a problem? Super. So he should not make any mistake? No, no, no. I'm super curious because Lewandowski, for him to be super A with big like him, is very technical.
Ermes Gasparini: He's a very smart guy, but he never pull with someone like Jarry. We see some different style from Lewand. Can I ask you something? I believe Lewand's wrist is stronger than yours, at least at that time.
Ermes Gasparini: But do you think Levan's arm is stronger than yours? I think one thing, and I think nobody can beat my back pressure exercise. You know, I went to Tbilisi and when they train, Herakle's arm, the hammer, brachioradialis, was
Host: Close. Close. Or maybe even at that time, maybe a little bit better, but not the pronation. But the brachioradialis training, I think that Irakli was not any behind, you know. Yeah. And then Jerry is going right through to, you know, not to the hand wrist right here, but he's just going right here. So if Levan doesn't have this, you see this side of the hand, Ermes, this, if he cannot block here,
Ermes Gasparini: And if it just ends up here like this, then it is trouble. Trouble, yeah. And the food, yeah, it will be very problem for labor. For sure. Yeah, we will see. We will see. Yeah.
Host: Levan thinks that you will be favored against Michael. Everybody thinks like this. Nobody believes in you. You better be careful. You better be careful.
Ermes Gasparini: don't don't listen you were favorite you were favored against devon as well you were favorite are you the same shape or right now you're here is now three months to prepare this it will be everything specific training total pipe trainer nicola he is training you
Host: Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow we go to him. Sikiwalachi, right? His name, last name. Sikiwalachi. Yeah, okay. That's my pronunciation. He invented the Todd Pipe. Oh, Todd Pipe, okay. He created the Todd Pipe. Now, with Todd Pipe, he don't have any chance. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. You better make your endurance good. If your endurance is not good, you be careful. Cardio, my friend.
Ermes Gasparini: Not only this cardio, but this cardio also needs... Running on the... Okay, okay, I understand, yeah. Like this, not like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Static exercise, super endurance to be good. Yeah.
Host: Yeah. Somebody asked me if I speak Russian. No, I don't speak. I know how to say. Yeah. You know, you know, the thing is that like, when, when, when you go to the, Privet means like, like, like hello or something. I think. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And when you go to WAF,
Host: most you hear in the past you were hearing all the time the russian national anthem and kazakhstan national anthem and then georgian because you all the time here because they are winning you know yeah yeah anyway so it will be it will be it will be a great event yeah so let's let's talk about the other matches i don't know how we ended up talking about the
Host: Todd Pipe. Todd Pipe. When you say like Todd Pipe, you know, people may misunderstand what you're talking about. No, I show to everybody Todd Pipe. Okay. Anyway, so one second, let me find the list. And then once I have the list, then I can...
Host: Yeah, I found it, yeah. So, basically, we have Corey West versus Tobias. Super interesting match. Super interesting. And they both have... Right, right or left? It's left arm, left arm, yeah.
Host: I try to imagine, you know, to see the future. I think that Corey has very strong outer side pressure, while Tobias has very strong hand, you know, very strong hand. And so we will see. I think it will be like Corey West with Kurdecha, more or less.
Ermes Gasparini: But listen, Corey West with right arm is like this. Corey West with left arm is like more pronation based. I think stronger Tobias with hand and wrist. So Tobias is stronger you are saying? Wrist. I think maybe one second round Corey will win.
Ermes Gasparini: After this, Tobias will win. Okay, okay. I think you say this because Corey West is the training partner of Michael Todd. I'm joking. No. No, no. He said Michael will be with me easy.
Host: What's that? Corey say this. Corey says that he's going to beat you. Michael will beat you. Okay. Is it easy? When did he say, when did he say this? Okay. One guy says, Matteo says that Indian try to learn Italian. Mi amico.
Ermes Gasparini: Okay, let's go to the next one. Matt Mask versus Marcio Barbosa. Matt Mask, last time it was very good shape. Marcio, I think statistically better for Matt Mask. He won last time, WAL, so...
Host: Yeah, Matt Mask won at that time, I think. Little bit favorite, Matt Mask. Hey, Ermes, there are guys on the chat that wants me to say some things in Italian. Can you check what they want me to say? Are they trying to make me say... No, no, no, don't speak. No, no, it's blasphemy. Oh, they want me to say bad things? Mimo, yes, don't say this. Should I block them? Should I block them?
Host: Stop 30 minutes. Oh, stop for 30 minutes. Okay, if they continue with bad words, just tell me which one is and then I will... No bad words, guys. Okay, okay. Okay, let's go. Lachlan versus Lars. Very, very weird, this fight.
Host: What do you think? I think that it is a very close match. And I think it is dangerous for both of them. I think here is important how Lachlan will handle that type of pressure. Okay, there is one guy, Ia Rossi. He wants me to say something. Is it something bad? So should I just... No, no, good. Like... No...
Host: it to you to tell michael toddy strongest than arm oh michael is stronger than hermes you want me to say okay yeah yeah yeah no no need to no need to it's my enemy this lagorosi okay okay okay just don't don't gp don't don't don't put anyone to the oh these are just joking these guys are joking on me yeah
Host: No, no, no, no, don't. Devon't put them on the block or something. Anyway, so let's go. Okay, what did we talk about Lachlan? I think 50-50, really. I agree as well. 51 for Lachlan because he's my good friend. Oh, you used to be his coach, right? Online coach. Yeah, yeah. Sometimes we speak together. We are more friends than...
Host: Okay, okay. Yeah, friends, good friends. Yeah, that's good. And let's go Dave Chaffee versus Gabor. But I will tell you something. Like, this event is really exciting. Really exciting. Yeah, yeah. I wish that we went there, you know. I wish I went there, you know, and watch in person. But I think it will be good. Maybe you and I, we should do a reaction video.
Host: together yeah we can do this really really very yeah and then we put on your channel yeah very good idea really yeah and i don't know gabor i show him the video he's a world champion super airway yes yes he is the current world champion in supreme weight yeah
Ermes Gasparini: I heard from Jeffy now he's super healthy, super strong. If Dave Jeffy is super healthy. He said in some interview he don't have problem neck. He's without pain. He's really good shape. I think if Jeffy is good shape, he's very dangerous. I mean, if Jeffy is in good shape,
Ermes Gasparini: Everyone is in trouble. Yeah, yeah. Believe me, Lamparelli is super strong, but he was very dominant with the wrist. Because Lamparelli's super strong wrist last time. Yeah. Maybe it was too much. But I knew that even if he takes the wrist, Dave Sheffield would win like this. Because they did this even to Vitalii Laletin, he did that.
Host: So if you didn't have the shoulder pressure, maybe you would be in trouble as well. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Jeffy the favorite, 60-40. Okay, okay. Mm-hmm.
Ermes Gasparini: And another great match, Sandris Sedis versus Rustam Bavaev. I saw the arm of Sandris. It's like a bodybuilder. It's bigger than when he was 150. I don't know what happened. But Rustam, good shape, hook. I think Rustam
Ermes Gasparini: For to have ability to hook is like same Matushenko. His hand, his wrist is unbelievable strong. Yeah. He two times hook directly. It is very, very hard to, I think one time hook and one time he beat him out or something, but two times he beat directly. I don't think he was in super shape.
Host: Yeah. After the pro-Indian. This Binyamin Lahu is my good friend. He says, Salaam alaikum, my son Riyadh is watching you and Ermes and says to me, tell to Ermes to say muka. I don't know what that means. What does it mean, muka? It's Italian. What's that? Muka. I don't know if you saw the interview between me and
Ermes Gasparini: Sorry, Eugenie and Kalina. Oh, I didn't see, but you guys had a good time. Very funny. We laughed like crazy because we said Genadi will lose because too much distracted for his girlfriend, blah, blah, blah. After this, Zeranov.
Ermes Gasparini: Because Zerano, every time when he fights, he does this. I don't know why. You saw when he did this. Zerano? Yeah, Zerano. Every time he does this. And he's like an animal, you know, milk. Animal, milk.
Ermes Gasparini: You mean cow? Cow, yes. And in Italian, mucca. Yeah, okay. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like a mucca. People love crazy, stupid people. So who's winning? Sandri is winning or Rustam winning? I think Rustam's favorite, 55.
Host: You know, this is one category above Rustem's category. Rustem is around 98, 99 kilos. Now? I mean, usually. And then he loses a little bit and then he goes 95. This is 105 category now. And now how much? He's probably very near 100s.
Host: Rustem is very near 100 kilos. But Rustem already known to be good enough to pull even heavier guys in the past. Even when he was 85 kilos. Yeah, you remember in AE1. Yeah. And there's Loti Tour. Really unbelievable. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rustem is no doubt legend, you know. Rustem is legend. Zolev is legend.
Ermes Gasparini: Anyway, so let's go. Let's go. Gabriela versus Barbora. Who is winning, Armas? I think 60-40, Barbora. Because she's super young, she's still growing up like crazy. Now she knows how to beat Gabriela.
Ermes Gasparini: Because he has too much long leverage for Gabriel, I think. And he can open the hand. Maybe the first round or second, Gabriel can win. After this, if he had wished to be tired, it would be like last time. Okay.
Host: Brian Shaw versus Eddie Hall. Devon't you think that Brian Shaw, to be dedicated for arm wrestling, such a famous and strong man, like he's strongest man, and he says that he wants to become an arm wrestler and he wants to pull Levan. It's very good for us.
Ermes Gasparini: For us it's fantastic to see how many super legends and famous in other sports come in armwrestling. It's because armwrestling is growing up, people see more videos, more fights and really it's a very beautiful sport.
Ermes Gasparini: And Brian, I saw he's really, really deep inside the sport. Really. And I heard many interviews from him. He's very smart because he knows what is better for him, what is better to do.
Host: I think you should train him to teach him how to do the orthodox way of arm wrestling. I don't think that he is ready for doing tricks or things like that, but I think he should learn the orthodox way of arm wrestling. And maybe you should travel and then train him at some point.
Ermes Gasparini: I hope they don't push him too much because it will be a mistake. No, he needs to go step by step. He needs to train, to do some matches, to learn the technique.
Host: He needs to be motivated and not to be crushed. No, no, no, no, no, no. It is the worst thing we can do. It is bad for Brian, bad for arm wrestling. He needs to go step by step, step by step. Yeah. Very important. Yes, yes, yes. No doubt. Both Royals. When will Devon pull Vitalii? Everyone wants to see at some point for sure. Maybe, maybe.
Host: Maybe in the second half of the year, maybe if Devon decides to go to super heavyweight again. I think this match needs to happen. Yeah, yeah. I mean, listen. For sure. Devon is almost 50 years old. If he quits arm wrestling without pulling these guys, everyone, it would be a shame, you understand? Because he's getting older. I think he can pull like...
Host: this level, he can pull a few more years, just say five more years. After that, maybe it will be, it's normal, you know, when you are 55, 56, even though Tata Sink still pulls. Before me too, again. Yeah, yeah, you guys are going to pull again, for sure, yeah. At some point, you need to pull. But just... Rematch. I mean, I think that like a lot of people talks about how
Host: Devon is important for these leagues, but these leagues are also very important for Devon, you understand? Because before these leagues, Devon... Everybody is important for everybody. Yeah, yeah. If you put only Devon in this league, how is he going? Yeah, yeah, I understand. But what I'm just saying that before a few years, Devon didn't really pull any of the top elite athletes from the Eastern, you understand?
Host: He only pulled left arm, Denis and Pushkar, and the right arm, Taras Ivakin, years ago. And his best career started with this league, that he started to pull the best guys from here. And it also helped him too. It also helped him too. Because I just checked it, like in 2022, he had 500,000 subscribers on YouTube. 2022 went right before he pulled Prudnik.
Host: And then in last two years, he went 1.1 million. So like 16 years, YouTube 500 and last two years. So he made best of his career in last two, two and a half years. Everybody, my friend, everybody, because if you see the follower of everybody. Yeah. Yeah. That, that, that is, that, that is a synergy, that synergy that it is. I'm happy that, you know, everyone started to pull everyone in the past.
Host: I mean, nobody was pulling anybody, you understand? They were just like, you understand? Everyone was separated from each other. Now, I think that, like, he added to his legacy a lot because the beating against you, against Georgi Swetko, against Denis Plenko, against...
Host: like Prudnik, Sandris, you know, so he had lately against Petrenko. So he really, you understand, before he was like more like North America, but now it's more international. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways, so, so how is training? How is training going, Ermes?
Ermes Gasparini: I feel very good, really. I thought maybe in two months it was not enough to become in very good shape, but really already now I'm in very good shape. Are you 85, 90% maybe now?
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, more or less. But for Michael, I need to train a lot of endurance. Because about power, no doubt I'm stronger than him. I need endurance. Endurance, for sure. It's the key to win this fight. And you are thinking that Levan is going to beat Jerry?
Host: Yeah, I think. David you hear what Levan said about you? Oh, you didn't see the podcast? Yeah, he said that this time it will be much more dominant, he said.
Host: like no no i'm not joking i'm not joking you will watch sometimes i tease you this time i'm not easy he said that that happened only one time and why are you laughing you know and then he said that why are you laughing why are you laughing listen you're talking about levan you know there is nothing to laugh yeah yeah i understand
Ermes Gasparini: Maybe he's angry because there are a lot of videos still, continue to put videos. Yes, yes, yes, yes, about that. He didn't like it. Listen, when that match finished, the impression in the community was like you won the match and he lost the match. You understand? It was almost like that. No, it's not because I won't, because it never happened.
Ermes Gasparini: No, I know, I know. It's not because of what you say. And still now, the people continue to put this video because the only man who did this to Lewa is Jean-Louis. Yeah, yeah. And a lot of people tease him because of the oxygen mask and everything. But, but, but, let me say, he didn't come to the table.
Host: But after five minutes, you were also sitting and you were also... No, no. I was ready for the fight. But you didn't come. You didn't come to the table either. I told him I didn't come, him too, and why I go to the table. Yeah, I mean, neither of them came. Like, you didn't... No, no. I told him to go to the table. I think you were also hardly breathing.
Ermes Gasparini: You were also, like, hardly breathing. It was not easy for you. Yeah, yeah, but I was ready to fight. Okay, okay, okay, yeah. Yeah, I think both of you were. Yeah, yeah, for sure. To smash me.
Ermes Gasparini: Yes. But I think next time it will be more hard for him. Okay, okay. I mean, that should be the goal. Because after Dagon, my wrist is completely different. And if I can take more in his wrist, my back pressure will grow power more than last time.
Host: You understand what I mean? I understand. If I take more here, my arm is more stronger. More effective, more effective. Weaker here, like just think about it. Even if you have strong arm, you have the dumbbell. If dumbbell is your wrist is going, you cannot lift here. Stronger here, more effective here, you know. So I understand. But he also says that he will be better. And I cannot wait. And I don't even know if you guys are going to pull. Maybe Michael and Jerry are going to pull.
Host: Why are you laughing? How do you know? Why are you laughing? I think that when you are laughing like this, Michael, you are making Michael angry. Okay. Michael is going to punish you. Maybe some surprise, my friend. We don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Poor Michael.
Ermes Gasparini: But really, I want to shoot now. You want? I'm serious. Okay. Michael, please. I'm very tired to see you use your bone block to do pronation lift and riser lift. Please, please. It doesn't help me. Show to me and to us, to our community,
Ermes Gasparini: How is your bicep stronger? Not your bone block. Your bicep. Show to me how you can do with this movement. This. Not this. This. Impronation and riser. Or back pressure. Please, I'm very curious to see.
Host: Okay. James, thank you, my friend. James says, it is so amazing how far East vs. West has come. Thank you, Engin, and all the amazing... Thank you, my friend. I think that, my friend, you guys are the biggest heroes because without your support, people like you, your support, we couldn't make it. And thank you for supporting this beautiful sport. That is, to me,
Host: Anyone who understands what's going on in armwrestling, some people think that you do this, but they need to understand what muscle groups are involved and all upper body. And you even use your feet, you know that. And the coordination of these muscle groups, it's a beautiful sport, like beautiful. And I thank everyone who understands this beauty and supports us.
Ermes Gasparini: and you guys are the real heroes. You guys are the real heroes. Yeah, and for our athletes, really, it's super amazing, really unbelievable things. Do you realize that... My more satisfaction, you know what is it, is to be recognized like a champion. You are, you are. Yeah, I was a champion. Yes.
Ermes Gasparini: That was my goal, my friend. That was my goal. I was a champion, my friend, but when I went to my city, nobody knew I'm right. How about now? How about now? How about now? Now, all the people, not all the people, but a lot of guys recognize me in the gym or in the bar. They know what is it I'm wrestling. They know I'm a champion. This is a really
Host: Only beginning. Yes, it will be more, Ermes. It will be more. I promise you, it will be more. It will be more. This is only beginning, my friend. And this East versus West is not my organization. East versus West, you remember in Yalova, first time when you were pulling that mask, it was the first one. And it didn't start as a business. It just started all together. I remember. Athletes.
Host: Organizer, we all together, we just made it up. This is a, like a rebellion to like, from us to the world. Like, you know, we are a beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it will be bigger.
Host: It will be bigger. Whenever you pull in Michael, my guess, there will be 2,000 spectators that are buying tickets and will be watching. You understand? Yeah, it will be amazing. That is also beginning. We will see 5,000 people. I'm not saying now, but we will see. We have the potential. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah.
Host: Yeah. And yeah, I mean, I believe that the future is bright and everything will be great. And I don't know, do you want to say anything more at it? Do you have any message? Really, really is amazing moment.
Ermes Gasparini: I never thought about this. If you asked me five years ago to see the future like this, I would have said maybe impossible. To see now where we are,
Ermes Gasparini: And to see the sport continue to grow up like this, to see the legends from other sports come with us, really is something special. Something special. And we deserve this. We deserve this.
Host: Yeah, yeah, we deserve more than this. We deserve more than this. More, more, my friend, really, really. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Anyways, Ermes, thank you very much for joining. Thank you so much. I hope that we, most likely I will be coming to Italy.
Host: And we will be watching together. Reach out to me if you can. Super happy. I will communicate with Katia as well. And it will be good. And to see the event together, it will be fantastic. Great. You take care of yourself and thanks to everyone for watching. Bye, guys.
