Host: Hello everyone. We are live again. Today I will have two of our world champion arm masters. And they both are known with their left arm
Host: I mean, better than right arm, I should say, for Daniel Prokopcik. Oleg Zor is all about left arm. So they will be here in a minute. Okay. Let me share this on social media.
Host: I hope you all have been doing well.
Host: let me share the link on instagram as well and then let's start
Host: hello hello daniel hello tiberio how are you good good and how are you guys good good good training hard okay let's start with you tiberio uh how do you see is it like my phone or yours is sideways or no you you me okay let me check on the um
Host: No, it looks like you guys were... How do you see... Sorry. Yeah, yeah, I think... Yeah, now it's okay, yeah. Anyway, so Tiberio, how do you see Daniel's form? People, most of the people, majority of the people think that Daniel has very little chance, people says. What do you think?
Tiberiu: I think he is in the best shape and I think he will surprise a lot of people by not only his form but also his strategy, which is the top secret.
Host: Yeah, yeah. But listen, it is also very hard to underestimate his opponent. Oleg Zhokh is also, for his weight category, very dangerous. But when you know Daniel Prokopchuk, he is a very smart guy, and he is very technical, and he understands armwrestling, and I am sure he is doing a very good homework. Yeah, exactly. But do you think it will be enough to win, or it will be enough to make a war, or how do you see it?
Tiberiu: Yeah, Oleg is a very uncomfortable arm wrestler. I know for a fact Daniel has enough strength to beat him. It's only a matter of how can he put that strength into... To apply the power.
Tiberiu: So that's the main challenge with Oleg. And also it's hard because we don't have Oleg's hand. I was trying to replicate Daniel's opponent. That's the only opponent I can't replicate because of his anatomy.
Host: by the way hello hello paulo hello oleg and again hello daniel and tiberia hi everybody hello hello
Host: Yeah, we were talking about it. I just wanted to ask Tiberio because he's also his training partner, Daniel's training partner. What he thinks, he says, Daniel is going to surprise a lot of people, he said. He said that he's in the best ever shape of his life. And yeah, and let's start with Oleg. Oleg, how are you, my friend? Good? It's good.
Host: Oleg, is it possible to put the phone somewhere so he wouldn't be moving all the time? Oleg, what is your weight right now?
Host: 86. 86. And when you competed against Badkili, it was 89? Well, his Badkili bro was 89. 87. 88 in this time. 88 maybe. Yeah, okay. I remember kind of like 89 or something. And is his form right now better than his form was against Badkili or about the same?
Oleg Zhokh: How is your form? Better than when you fought with a bad kill? I try to get better every time. My injuries interfere, but I try. I was very affected by the defeat from a bad kill. I think I will try not to repeat it.
Oleg Zhokh: Molok is saying that he's trying to improve his form every time. Sometimes his injuries are on the way, but the fact that he lost to Betkili got him very much, so he's been working as hard as he possibly can and he will try not to repeat the mistake. Aha, aha. Done yet.
Host: Like if you and Beth Keighley, you remember Beth Keighley also was very good in WAF. And if you had Beth Keighley, 80 kilo, it would be, I think, very good match. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But when Beth Keighley is 95 kilo, tall guy, he's strong. And he barely beat Oleg Dzok. Later rounds, he exhausted him and beat him. But the first rounds were very hard.
Host: And he has long forearm to reach, you know, father, unlike yours, he's taller than you. Um, I'm not doubting you, but how do you see your chances? Like how, like a lot of people are thinking that way. And how do you think that, uh, how do you say in your mind, how do you see yourself winning?
Tiberiu: Betkili is even harder than you, 95 kg. He has a longer hand than you. How do you think, with a short hand and less per kilogram, many people will ask this question? I mean, if Betkili barely managed, very hard,
Tiberiu: I think the physical strength is enough, but the grip and the position of the strap matter a lot. So he says the strength is enough, but the most important thing, and that's what I was talking about earlier, is positioning the grip, you know, because
Tiberiu: but Kelly and Daniel, you know, have enough strength is not a strength thing. You know, it's just, just getting the right setup and attacking in the right direction, you know? Yes. Yes. And even but Kelly, it's not like he had maybe the perfect game plan. Maybe, maybe there's another way of, you know, um, um,
Host: approaching this match. We have seen Talgat beating Oleg, but Talgat is very fast, very quick. Daniel is not as quick as Talgat. Does he think that it is a disadvantage for him for positioning?
Host: Can you repeat the last part? It's not as fast as Talgat, but...
Host: And he's not so, that's the thing that it's a disadvantage for him to position him because he's talking about he's strong enough. If he has the position, he will beat him. But to position is not that easy because of Oleg's hand and size and everything, also very strong. And so Talgat did that with like a very quick movement before Oleg reacted.
Host: And then since you are not as quick as him and you don't have that forward shoulder pressure, do you think that the positioning will be hard for you? Yeah, yeah. So, you know,
Tiberiu: People think Daniel is not fast, you know, but he never tries to flash pin a guy, you know. He tries to, you know, be as quick as possible to position, you know. So he would be which position to aim for, you know. So we're working on going very fast, you know.
Tiberiu: But not to the pad, you know, it's very hard, you know, maybe Tal got his game, you know, but we will be very fast, but to a certain position from which Daniel can say, can apply his strength, you know.
Host: Oleg, can you make sure that you keep your phone, like, sideways? Also, the phone needs to be sideways, but if you just unlock and then even you do sideways, it will still turn it, correct? Yeah. Yeah.
Host: yeah i think um okay and daniel one more question how do you see your chances like you both have equal chance or you think you are favorite or his favorites how do you see i i ask you like like normally it's not normal thing to ask if your opponent do you think his favorite but we are talking about you coming from 77 kilo and he is 85 kilo so it is not that easy always to beat
Daniel Procopciuc: uh a guy who is weighing heavier than you so how do you see your chances yeah so daniel says because he didn't
Tiberiu: fight with him not even you know sparring or anything you know like he he doesn't have any information prior information so it's uh a toss-up he 50 50 you know so doesn't uh really have information to go on you know i understand and and oleg how do you see sorry sorry you say it
Tiberiu: I just want to say at least, you know, like a friendly sparring match just to feel, you know, the grip and everything, you know, but he doesn't have any information, you know, like hands on. Yeah, but you say that he is your training partner and he is in best ever shape in his life.
Tiberiu: yeah yeah but uh that's that i try to replicate you know a very difficult guy to replicate you know so yeah of course strength-wise you know unbelievable left hand you know and left hand was his his uh i wouldn't say he's so his shape is the best you know but
Tiberiu: Of course we're trying to replicate as best as we can Oleg's style and the uncomfortable positions and the strap positions that we think we're going to get into.
Host: Whenever he pulled against Bojidar, he showed us that he also had top role ability now with left and with right. He had that. With left, he was only supinating, only supinating. But now he started using his pronator. Does he think that he will need his pronator during this match?
Tiberiu: They said they saw Bojdan Hristula starting to pull top rolls on the left. Do you think you will need this technique? Yes, they say that now he will start pulling left and right, with top rolls and hookers.
Tiberiu: Yeah, he just thinks it's more efficient to top all the hook guys and hook the top all of us. Okay, I understand. But Bozidar went inside, right? Yeah, so when he went inside, Daniel went outside. But with Oleg, he's a little bit special, so we...
Tiberiu: we can it will be a hybrid so to say uh style you know not uh yeah so daniel says you know he he makes surprise uh in a match with uh with an outside move so uh he's not outside of you know his strength you know only if he feels like he can pull it off you know
Oleg Zhokh: Yeah, but he has it ready. He's bringing it to Tbilisi. But we don't know if he's going to use it or not. Okay, I understand. Are you ready to talk to me? Yes, I'll just briefly translate for you. Well, they say, how are you going to fight? Well, he says, listen, I think you need to twist the top rollers into the hook and you need to top roll the hookers. And they said how he fought with Bozhedar. No one knew that he could top roll with his left hand.
Oleg Zhokh: And he says, this is the position, listen, I understand everything, I've never fought with Oleg because of that, let's see. He says he'll beat me. Will he say his words? I'll ask them who he beat, that they'll fight with him.
Oleg Zhokh: Before you translate, I want to ask somebody. Daniel, do you understand what Oleg says?
Oleg Zhokh: no no no no right yeah it's ukrainian russian different right yeah yeah yeah yeah okay go ahead uh saying uh that uh daniel saying for about two years that he will win uh with oleg and oleg is asking uh why do you think so who do who did you win uh before me that you think that you're gonna win with me oh they talk this about this is the conversation that happened before between them
Oleg Zhokh: Oleg, did you talk about it with Daniel? I think it was at a world championship or European championship. We were at a competition. He's been talking about it for a long time. I don't remember which championship it was, but he's been talking about it for a long time. He says he's going to win. I tell him it's good, I don't say anything, I don't object to anything. I say it's good that you're going to win. I say everyone can win, it's a sport, anything can happen.
Oleg Zhokh: That conversation was pretty long ago on some of the championships. He doesn't remember. It's a world or European. They were pulling together on the same championships. And Daniel says that, I'm going to win with you. I'm going to beat you. And Oleg said, who did you beat till now that you think that you can beat me? Yeah. Wow. That's the question.
Tiberiu: i mean he doesn't remember the exact conversation but yeah daniel says if he said it he will he will uh you know uh
Host: take his word you know like he will he will uh okay if i said it i i have to do it so he will do it five minutes ago the chances was 50 50 now 100 done here because he said it daniel
Oleg Zhokh: okay okay so should i understand from this that oleg saying that like
Host: who did you beat till today that you think you can beat me and then you thinking that you're gonna beat me so it means that you guys are smoking something so it means that Oleg thinks that he's gonna win 100%
Oleg Zhokh: Oleg, does it mean that you think that you will win 100%? Well, I can't be 100%, but as I said, I repeat the words, as Betkili said, that I said that I, he said at the press conference, well, this is in front of everyone, that I calculate that he has no equal in the category of 95 kg, and no one will fight me there. So I'm almost sure that 85 kg
Oleg Zhokh: oleg is saying that uh it's never a hundred percent and he said listen we're gonna
Oleg Zhokh: But he said, I will repeat the words that 95 kilos is my class. And Oleg saying that I want to say the same about 85 kilos, that there is not too many people who can challenge me. And most likely now nobody will win me at the moment. And he said...
Oleg Zhokh: daniel is coming from a very low weight class and he is a little bit uh this is this is not exactly translatable but i would use word delusional that he think that he may go that high up and win i think it was longer than that yeah
Host: No, that's about it. David you translate everything, Tiberius? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Daniel says anything is possible. I mean, he's used to fight bigger guys. It's not like his first time. Listen, let me steer the boat a little bit. He said he called Daniel delusional. Any response to that? I won't respond to that.
Tiberiu: uh a lot of people call daniel uh you know delusional or like names like this you know uh for example uh the zola match before the zola match and before other matches you know so uh he's used to proving people wrong you know so uh nothing uh
Oleg Zhokh: out of the ordinary here you know so so he said he's used to it doesn't bother him yeah people are doubting him you know yeah okay yeah
Oleg Zhokh: Who did he win against? Not from his own gym.
Oleg Zhokh: Oleg is asking who do you win from the highest weight classes? Who did you win from the highest weight classes? Not from weight classes. Champions, any champions.
Tiberiu: He only lost to Samusha in 85 kilograms. No, no, he's asking who is the heaviest guy that he ever beat, you know, very famous, right? Yes, absolutely.
Tiberiu: Daniel says you know in the last you know period he never felt any you know difficulty with the left hand you know so
Oleg Zhokh: mean uh you you are asking the right question right you are asking we are not asking about category in his career maybe you asked that yeah exactly he asking in your career who did you beat who is heavier weight class names like like who is the guy that he made 100 kilos famous in the past famous names exactly that's the question he says he didn't have official matches
Host: Yeah, but Andre wrote here, and before Andre wrote, I also remember, did you not beat Clement Dimitro with left arm during the pandemic? You did, right? Yeah. Can you ask him how long that match was? How long? How quick it finished? How quick? Yeah, I mean, how long the match was?
Host: I mean, 20-30 seconds maybe, you know, but... It was a match of 20-30 seconds. Before the pandemic, Oleg Zhokh also had a final with Plamen at WAF. They also had about a 20-second match against Plamen. I didn't understand, Tiberiu, what you were saying.
Host: Daniel said that match wasn't very hard, you know. But you said 20-30 seconds, so yeah. I mean, just what I'm just saying. Yeah, unusual time, you know, for Daniel's style, you know. That's just Daniel's style, you know, just, yeah. Okay, yeah. So, what I'm just saying is that they both have wins against Plymouth and it took about the same time.
Oleg Zhokh: And he says, well, Engin summed it up, he says, yes, it's true. And he remembers how you fought with Flamien in the finals, and also there was a fight, well, maybe not intense, but not right away, not in touch, you hit each other. And they also fought like that, and Daniel won. He says, well, that is, you won against the same people. And, in principle, the fights were similar. So maybe it will be interesting.
Oleg Zhokh: Oleg is saying, yeah, I never said that it's going to be a very easy match, but I will try to make it look easy. Oh, okay. So he said that he's going to win, but it may not be easy. Yeah, that's what he said. Yeah, yeah.
Host: More Oleg talks confidently, more it triggers Daniel Apt.
Tiberiu: Daniel says he's focused and he has the the game plan very precise in his head you know so he's very focused to just executing the game plan you know so
Tiberiu: Even Bozidar, who is the friend, tried to make him unfocused, but he will be very focused and he will not let any trash talk deter him. Yeah, I don't think Oleg is doing trash talk. Oleg is just stating his opinion here, I think.
Oleg Zhokh: Engin says, listen, the more Oleg shows that he is confident in himself, the more it affects Daniel. And Daniel says, no, it doesn't affect him, everything is fine. He says, listen, I have my players in preparation, I support him a lot, I know what I am preparing for, I have a plan, and that's it, we will fight. He has very big cheeks, what can stop him?
Oleg Zhokh: He's saying that you have big chicks and it's maybe in the way. Chicks? What does it mean? I didn't understand, Paolo. No, Oleg is saying that he has big chicks and they are maybe on his way.
Host: The last part I didn't understand. The chicks, they are maybe on his way. It can be difficult to win with this big of the chicks. But why is it? What does it mean? I don't know. I don't know. I'm translating here. Okay, okay. I thought that maybe it was a cultural meaning. No, not as I know of. Okay.
Host: okay okay let's see let's see how it will go and and daniel oleg said that betkili said 95 kilo is betkili's category and oleg says that 85 kilo his category and he says your category is 77 so he means that you should stay there you know
Tiberiu: Daniel says 77 is indeed his category, but he needs to progress. If he only stays in 77 without any notable challenges,
Tiberiu: So he needs to constantly challenge himself, you know. So that's the main driver, you know. I understand. He needs bigger goals. Yeah, bigger goals and challenges. Oleg, he says, listen, you said that 85 is your category, so he should be in his smaller categories, 77.
Oleg Zhokh: He says, yes, I agree, I'm 77, but I need a challenge all the time so that I can progress better. I need someone who is much stronger than my opponents in 77. Otherwise, I will not progress, I will rustle in my category. So you have to develop all the time and take more challenges.
Oleg Zhokh: Milo, it's Milo. Yes. He said that's very brave, very brave. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You did the same thing for many years. You pull against him. Yeah.
Oleg Zhokh: Yeah Oleg is saying yeah because there was not enough opponents in my weight class and it was offered to
Oleg Zhokh: uh participate in a bigger world class and i agreed and yeah i said exactly the same here also says that uh he likes the opportunity that maybe i will be back to him again
Host: I think he's coming back because he gave Badkili a very hard match, especially in early rounds. Let me a little bit tease Oleg. Oleg, Daniel said that he is doing arm curls with your weight and there is no way that you can beat him. What do you think?
Oleg Zhokh: He says that Daniel makes your body weight on the biceps. He says that it's impossible for you to beat him. Of course, I lift 1.5 kg, and 1.5 kg is his weight.
Oleg Zhokh: Oleg says that he's curling one and a half of his body weight. But Oleg says that, you know what, in reality, I'm for sure curling his body weight.
Oleg Zhokh: Okay, okay. He's saying that he has a dumbbell which is a little bit bigger than Daniel's body weight and he's training with that one.
Tiberiu: You first translated and then you tell to Daniel what he said. I translated to him and he responded that it's normal that he curls his body weight because he is a lot lighter than Oleg. It doesn't matter the weight. The main thing is that you can translate the weight that you put in the room to the table.
Tiberiu: And the main, you know, the most important is not the weights that you, you know, use in training, but, you know, to translate the strength of training to the table, you know, so let's see how much of this translation, you know, who's translating
Host: better you know the the weights from the training sessions you know the weight training you know you know to the table you know yeah yeah but but there was a point in daniel's career that he wanted to do 90 kilo more more more and now he thinks a little bit differently compared to that time he now cares more about the quality uh more than the the the weight
Tiberiu: Yeah, a lot of people that watch Daniel Train notice that the angles
Tiberiu: you know, are not correct, you know, maybe for bodybuilding, maybe for, you know, but that are the angles in which Daniel, you know, is pulling in arm wrestling, you know, with the strap, you know, where, you know, it's not all on, you know, on the elbow flexor, you know, it's more on the back and, you know, so things are not,
Tiberiu: how they seem you know even even though you know people think that he's he's he's not doing the right form or you know no i mean like daniel is the reason behind all the types of exercises he uses you know okay
Host: Okay, so let's talk about some other matches. And let's start with Stoyan Golemanov and Vasily Dautashvili. Let's start with you, Oleg. We'll talk about the second match, Stoyan. Who will win, he asks.
Oleg Zhokh: I can't say for sure, but I think it will be an interesting match. Oleg cannot answer this question for sure, but it's going to be an interesting one. And Daniel? Stoyan. Stoyan, OK. OK, and Baciu Saginashvili versus Brett Grundy. Zhokh? Baciu and Grundy.
Host: Daniel, now I want to start from you. Artur Makaro, Daniel Prokopcik. Daniel Prokopcik.
Host: When? May? May? 50-50. Oh, Oleg says 50-50. Well, look at that. Wow. And listen, Daniel, if you pull Arthur Makarov in May for the world title, right arm, after the event, how many belts you will have?
Tiberiu: He said he hopes by the end of the year
Host: No, okay, by the end of the year. Oh, okay. So he's planning to be Oleg. He already has one belt. He plans to have the second one now and then Arthur and then he's gonna be David Samusha in 85 kilo. Okay, I understand. Wow. Imagine him having four belts. Wow. It would be incredible. Yeah. Anyways.
Oleg Zhokh: Engin asks him, how many belts do you plan to have after you fight Makarov in May? He says, let me tell you this, not in May, but by the end of the year, I plan to have four belts. He smokes something, really.
Host: Oleg's saying that you're probably smoking something. Oh, again. Daniel, are you smoking anything? I'm asking, Oleg is asking. I always believe, always believe the dreams, but Oleg thinks that it is not dream, it is delusion. Nothing, he's very...
Host: conscious you know very aware no smoking no smoking yeah no smoking okay yeah he's a doctor doctor orthopedic surgeon i know i know daniel you know i'm i'm telling you know yeah anyway so maybe maybe some metal rods you know in his uh
Host: you know, his arms, you know, you never know. Okay. Anyway, so let's go to another one. David Dadikyan versus Alex Kurdecha. Oleg. Kurdecha. Kurdecha. Mr. Kurdecha? Okay. Kurdecha.
Tiberiu: And what is your opinion, how the match is going to be, Daniel? Daniel says Dadikyan will quickly get inside, you know, quickly get him into a hook and Hudeca will not be able to top hole.
Oleg Zhokh: That's interesting. And Oleg's commented that, well, it's not easy because Kurdecha's arm is very long. I want to comment on this too, if you guys don't mind. Yeah, yeah. Everybody saw his match with Babaev, who is a very good hook puller, back in 19, right? Babaev? In 2019, Babaev and Kurdecha.
Oleg Zhokh: on uh in uh rumia in poland and babaev couldn't hook him okay
Host: Okay, okay, but what was Babayev doing in 2019, Rubin? Babayev was in top eight. Top eight, yes. And they pulled Kurdecha and Babayev. Are you talking about Kurdecha and Babayev? Okay, okay, okay, yeah, okay, okay, okay. Yeah, and she couldn't hook him, so it's, you know. But it's not the next hand right now.
Host: Yeah, they pull in left, but it was right. I mean, but our anthropometry is similar, you know, and they both hook pullers and very fast hook pullers. Yeah, yeah. But just remember, Babaev is 172 and Dadikyan Yanni is very near 185, you know. Yeah, yeah, taller, for sure. And Babaev is...
Oleg Zhokh: I think Dadikyan is 125 kilos and Babaev is... Shall we talk about it? Yeah, sure. Anyway, so let's go to... We were talking about the style and how Babaev couldn't twist it in 2019 in the hook, and they think that Dadikyan will do it now. I say that it's not easy with such long ropes. I was talking about it. Yes, yes, the same.
Host: I think Kalinichenko, yes.
Host: Kalinichenko is from Ukraine as your countryman and Kalinichenko is your good friend, Daniel. Is this your opinions are based on how close they are to you or objective opinion? Daniel says
Tiberiu: He's not affected by this. He just has a lot of horse power. Is he going to have the same horse power when he loses weight? Daniel says he doesn't believe he lost any muscle.
Tiberiu: daniel says even with him you know that doesn't help to you know um get five kilo more you know like doesn't really help arm wrestling you know so yeah a few a few kilograms of fat you know doesn't really affect uh i think i think he's losing losing more than 10 kilos i think
Oleg Zhokh: But it's only body weight or water weight before the competition. Kalinichenko would know better. His shape didn't change so much. Let me translate real quick because Oleg wants to be part of it.
Oleg Zhokh: Engin says, what do you think? Daniel said that Kalinichenko will win because he is very powerful and very strong. And Engin asks, do you think he will lose this strength? Because he has to lose a lot of weight. But Daniel says that no, he won't lose much weight for armwrestling, because if he loses 10 kilos of fat and water, it won't affect his strength.
Host: Oleg says, yeah, absolutely. If he will not do any mistakes in the preparation, then everything's going to be fine. OK. Daniel, FIAA, Raizek versus Malin Bergström? FIAA. FIAA. FIAA, yeah. OK. And Oleg? Oleg thinks FIAA too, yeah. OK.
Host: And let's go with...
Oleg Zhokh: Tad Hutchings vs. Irakli Zirakashvili. I just don't want, I don't want only who's gonna win, but I want you guys to tell me how the match is gonna go. Tad Hutchings vs. Irakli Zirakashvili. He asks not only to say who will win, but also how you think the match will be. You don't have to describe Hutchings, because he showed that he still has
Oleg Zhokh: But I think Irakli will do everything right and will win the youth. And how will he win the youth?
Oleg Zhokh: Oleg is saying that we cannot, you know, put on a short at Hutchings when he's in very good shape for his age. But he said that young and very progressive Zirakashvili will win. And I asked specifically how he's going to win, and he said that his top role will be better than Hutchings can carry.
Tiberiu: Yeah, so Daniel says, you know, Todd Hutchings is very, very strong, but in terms of progress, you know, he sees Irakli, you know, had huge progress lately, you know, so...
Host: he also tends to favor you know iraqi just based on that progress you know i understand and oleg petrenko betkili oniani oleg petrenko petrenko
Host: When you were preparing for the Betkili match, Petrenko was preparing for Devon. He was preparing for right arm, but you trained with him with left arm. And you told me that Petrenko is stronger. So how is it now? Still Petrenko is stronger than you?
Oleg Zhokh: Well, not all of them. Partially. When you were preparing for the previous match, and Petrenko was preparing for La Rata, he knows that you were sparring all the time, and you said that Petrenko is stronger with his left hand than you. You were sparring with your left hand at home, too.
Oleg Zhokh: He asks how this process is happening now when you are sparring. Is he stronger than you now when you are sparring or has something changed? He is stronger, but I know how he is now in his fight.
Oleg Zhokh: He said, yeah, Petrenko is still stronger, but also because the sparring partners, he said, I know how to pull Petrenko in my style. So it's a little bit different, but he said, yeah, it's still, he's still stronger. And what does he think about his match? If he goes down to 95, not if, but whenever it comes 95 kilos, how does he think of his chance against Petkin? You know, he throws it to 95, Petrenko throws it to 95.
Oleg Zhokh: What do you think will happen in the match? What are the chances?
Oleg Zhokh: He said that it won't be difficult for him to throw them away. He said that if he throws them away, he will come prepared in category 95. They will throw away, I think, one opponent. Both Betkely and Petrenko have about the same weight. But I think that Oleg will do everything right and prepare and will not do it on the last day.
Oleg Zhokh: So he's basically saying that it's not going to be hard dropping the weight for Petrenko because he knows how to do it. And he said, listen, the other party will have to drop some weight too.
Oleg Zhokh: and, you know, they will meet at 95, and he believes that Petrenko knows how to prepare himself at the drop weight. And he said that it's not going to be an easy, easy match, but he believes that Petrenko will force his style, and he's going to win. Okay. And Tanya? I think Petrenko. Petrenko, easy, hard? It's a very interesting match.
Host: But is it gonna be a battle or is it gonna be this? No flash, hard match. Hard match, okay. Yes, but Petrenko win. And Petrenko do you think has better endurance than Betkili has? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. Daniel, my thumb hurts, sore. Why do you think it happened? It was good.
Tiberiu: Maybe you have nerve compression, carpian tunnel syndrome maybe. How about a tough pronation training? What pronation? Can you repeat Engin? How about a tough pronation training?
Tiberiu: Could that pose that as well? Yeah, absolutely. Especially if you are using the thumb in... No, no, I know why it is hurting. I'm just telling him that somebody is training. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, anyways.
Tiberiu: He says he's not going to fight you anytime soon. He wants to have four titles at the end of the year. We may meet each other.
Tiberiu: he says he he if he wins four titles you know he he just uh you know um uh retired like khabib you know like king glory you know so oh he will retire like a champion listen that that that guy i'm telling you his his elbow joint is just like rock
Host: I kind of think I still will take his wrist, but who knows. But to finish him, problem. But if I pull him, I will not overpronate. I need to control his pronator. So this is okay. This, when Prokopchuk here, problem. If Prokopchuk here, it's good. Let me translate this to Oleg.
Oleg Zhokh: Engin starts joking, he says, listen, my thumb started to hurt. He's a doctor, he's a surgeon. He says, don't you know what? He says, well, maybe you have some kind of nerve there, or what? He says, no. And he says, can it be because I train my pronator very actively?
Oleg Zhokh: He says, oh, so you're training? He says, well, yes, I'm coming back, so it may soon be that you'll have to fight me too. Daniel says, listen, I won't fight you, I respect you very much to fight you. He says, if I win all four of my belts, I'll go to retirement right away, like Khabib.
Oleg Zhokh: But Engin says, well, no, you can't just go like that, you'll probably have to fight me. He says, but I'm smart, I know that you can't be very strong, that you need to keep control of your bones and not twist you very strongly. Because if he says he will twist you strongly, then here the problem is to finish you. So he says, I'm smart, I know how to beat you.
Oleg Zhokh: i'm ready guys you're ready yeah
Host: I have another question. One time I almost pulled Daniel Samusha. Almost. And then I was doing isometric and then the belt went and I hit and then I had some concussion. And I couldn't pull. And whenever I asked Daniel, I said, Daniel, do I have a chance? And Daniel thought that I was the favorite.
Daniel Procopciuc: And he wrote to me on WhatsApp. Can you ask him if he was joking with me or if he was serious? He asked me if I was joking with him on WhatsApp. Yes. No, I was serious because I knew how to attack him from a weak point of view. I knew what he was doing, but I didn't know how to act. And because of the trauma I didn't know how to win.
Tiberiu: So he says he didn't joke at all because you know which points to attack with Samusha and Daniel says he
Tiberiu: he also knew you know but he didn't have enough for endurance and the the shoulder just didn't uh uh was enough you know for him that day you know but you know he wasn't really 85 kilo i don't think he was 85 kilo daniel was light right daniel you were yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and 70 80 you know 79 79 yeah so daniel knew
Tiberiu: know where to attack you know and and he he thinks that you you also know where to attack you know so that's the most important you know because all all uh top guys are strong you know it's not not about strength you know so where to apply it so in this in this category you are one of the best you know and and the question to daniel daniel your shape against
Tiberiu: Malin Zolev was better than your shape when you pull against Samusha? Yeah, he says yes.
Tiberiu: a better shape with uh with uh alan zalueva by a lot by a lot and if you ever pull david samusha we will see even a better shape than when he pulled against alan uh
Tiberiu: if he doesn't go back in the meantime so in the meantime if he doesn't go back to 77 and he stays 80 because he's 80 right now you know then yes 100 if he goes back and forth you know it's hard to you know
Host: But he will be at least Malin Zola of shape. At least, yeah. Because these are very interesting. Daniel Prokopcuk is a superstar. And Arthur is a superstar. And Samusha is a superstar. So to see these guys pulling against each other for me is incredible. Anyway, so let's go to the next ones.
Oleg Zhokh: Michael Todd vs. Ermes Gasparini, Oleg. It will be a very interesting fight. I think that if Michael Todd is in good shape and Gasparini is in good shape, then it will be a tough fight, but for some reason I think that Gasparini will win.
Daniel Procopciuc: Moloch is saying that if they both will be in their peak form, he thinks it's going to be a prolongated match, but he still thinks that Gasparini will pull the win. And Daniel? I think Mike Trotter has a lot of blood. I think he has a lot of blood. I think he has a lot of blood. I think he has a lot of blood. I think he has a lot of blood. I think he has a lot of blood. I think he has a lot of blood.
Tiberiu: So Daniel says actually Michael Todd, because he got back his shape, his shape back, you know, after the surgery. And so there are a lot of factors, you know, Michael Todd's press, you know, very big factor, you know, and also Gasparini, you know, he thinks he's too confident, you know.
Tiberiu: that he can win with Michael Todd. So he might be surprised in the match. Do you think because of the confidence he may make mistakes? Yeah. Because if the first match doesn't go his way,
Tiberiu: Then his confidence level will plummet and Michael Todd is a very good endurance puller, very good tactics. What if the first round goes as Ermes plans? Will it affect Michael's confidence?
Tiberiu: Yeah, he doesn't think he will affect Michael Todd. Michael Todd is more experienced and just his like mindset, you know, like he doesn't give up, you know, very good endurance, you know, like if he has a chance, you know, like he'll pull 100%, you know,
Tiberiu: constantly you know so i i i'm sure that he expects michael todd maybe expects to have a loss there you know he's not like like confident like
Oleg Zhokh: I think it all depends on how they prepare for this fight. Who can weigh 150 kg and win, and who can weigh 150 kg and be in good shape and win. It all depends on how serious they are in this.
Oleg Zhokh: Oleg is saying that probably at the very end of the top line will be who will prepare better because it's very similar level for them. And he said, listen, they may be both at 150 kg there on the stage. No, I mean, Ermes will not be probably
Host: even 130 but i know michael was about 140 i don't know how big he is right now but yeah anyway so let's go devon versus gennady and this time you start you start daniel oh daniel okay he says that that one because he will um he will uh fix the error
Host: Do you think, Daniel, that the match being in Tbilisi, will it give any advantage to Genadi or it doesn't help?
Tiberiu: yeah so so actually the is kind of a bad thing because the pressure is enormous on on gennady uh because of the home crowd you know and the pressure to win you know because he knows uh when when the matches and uh you know european championship and uh you know was in his hometown you know the pressure on him was
Tiberiu: greater much greater than you know uh somewhere when he went uh yeah yeah yeah so it depends so daniel is those type of guys that you know doesn't like that pressure
Host: No, I'm the same way. Some people like to focus and think and they don't want so much.
Host: to get emotional when you get emotional yeah yeah you are not thinking clearly anymore i know daniel is a very smart guy yeah and then i he wants to use that that he doesn't want emotional pressure i understand and okay okay what do you think oleg
Oleg Zhokh: Larratt already understands that it wasn't easy for him, but Genadi will be at home, and at home, as you say, the scene helps. It will give him a big advantage, but I think Larratt will take it into account and make his own adjustments. And Larratt will win.
Oleg Zhokh: Well, I think he did everything to win, because Genadi still has an old injury, he had a serious injury, so I don't think it will be of any use to him, and I think he has all the chances.
Oleg Zhokh: Okay, so yeah, he said that the matches in Tbilisi will help Genadi a lot because it's his alma mater, his, you know, his land. On the other hand, that Larratt knows it's not going to be an easy match and he did
Oleg Zhokh: homework and he will fix all the mistakes and he will do everything to win. It was not, you know, a certain answer from Oleg who gonna win, but I believe that he thinks that Devon is slight favorite. And then the World Super Heavyweight left arm title. Artem Morozov and Vitalii Laletin. Artem Morozov doesn't talk so much.
Host: But every time I see him, he's getting bigger, bigger, bigger. He is now more than 140 kilos. And so he is more than 10 kilos heavier probably since the time he pulled Alex Kurdecha. And everyone says that Laletin is favorite. And what does Dania think?
Tiberiu: He says, you know, he doesn't think there is somebody in the world that can beat Raleigh in left hand. And who is the closest guy? David he not think that Kamil almost beat him?
Host: Yeah, he says, you know, Camille has the right style. Yeah, because when you overpronate, now you are on your brachioradialis, so you are vulnerable for the... Because brachioradialis is not... With better preparation, he can pull it off. Yeah, with better preparation, he can pull it off, you know. Better preparation for laryngeal or Camille? No, better preparation for Camille. Yeah, yeah. But just think about this one as well.
Host: Kamil always pulls against top-rollers. He's very experienced. But for Laletin, it was a new experience. You understand? I think that next time if they pull, Laletin also will come a different game plan. I think that overpronation is a problem. You know, you need to a little bit block from the supination side and then, you know, go over to this side instead of... Yeah, but it's very hard when the guy is just pushing already like this and then you are, you know...
Host: Anyway, so who is the closest guy? Kamil then? Levan, Levan, no more. Levan, shoulder. Yeah, Morozov and Kamil. Alijan doesn't have a chance? Maybe Alijan.
Tiberiu: Daniel, you are one of the best
Host: left hand guy, you know, you won many world titles and everything. Of course your right arm is very good, but with left arm you are more successful. So we can consider you like two hand successful guy, but how did you enjoy
Host: when you saw Matushenko and Alijan ready to go boom in the center. David you like what you saw? David you enjoy it? He said you know his favorite match that he was the in his opinion the best match
Host: It was a very good match. Also, the level of the match was very high because Matushenko's left arm for 115 kilos is very high and Alican's very high. Whenever they pull and then they stop in the center, I mean, I can't. The time stopped for me. I really love this.
Host: I said this many times, but again, the same thing happened when Devon stopped Levan in the round one. I was like, real? You know, like, yeah. There are some moments that, you know, like time stops, you know. That Matushenko-Alican in round one of the Devon versus Levan was just, I don't know, for me. And so you are saying that Vitalii is going to beat Morozov.
Oleg Zhokh: Oleg, there was a very short prelude that Morozov doesn't talk much, but he's gaining weight. He's gained more than 140 kg, he's growing. He's preparing seriously. And Laletin, Laletin, wherever he is, who do you think will win? I think Laletin should win.
Oleg Zhokh: I don't know if I'll do it, but I can stop it and put it where I should have put it in 2018. Okay, so who will win? I think that Valery will win.
Oleg Zhokh: Oleg believes that Laletin is going to win, but he also said that he, Oleg, is supposed to put Laletin where he is supposed to be, and he did it in 2018, but he is not in that shape yet, but he will be. Yeah, I understand that, but does he think that Laletin of today and Laletin of that time are the same Laletin?
Oleg Zhokh: I hope so. We want you to come back here. Oleg, can you tell us
Oleg Zhokh: like shortly those guys that you beat in your career those those super heavyweights you beat you beat you beat
Host: Okay, you beat Laletin? And then tell me, you beat Trubin? You beat Pushkar?
Oleg Zhokh: And then you tell me more. One time you pinned Devon, but I don't know if maybe they didn't count. He said I don't count Devon because it was not counted, but yeah, it was close to be pinned, but whatever. Yeah, but I think on that day he was pulling three categories.
Host: You fought in two categories? Yes, I won in three categories. Devon won in one category. Oleg won in three categories. Oleg was only 165 pounds. 70, 80, 90, I won. No, 70, 80, 90, and he won 100+. 70, 80, and 90, Oleg won. Devon won 100+, and then they pulled. I think he won 75, 90, 100.
Host: and then lost in the super heavyweights. But he was playing four categories, you know, it's incredible. He said, yeah, I want three, but I want to win the fourth one, but it was not enough. It was incredible, yeah. What does he think? He's just going 75 kilos, winning three categories and actually pinning Devon, but they are giving foul and things like that. And then...
Host: He is pulling Mazgan Shamiev at the Zloty and then Mazgan flash pins him. He is pulling Plamen Dimitrov and then 20 seconds they have war. Like, how is it? Like, is it like, like how, these two example I gave was before his accident.
Host: Why does he think that sometimes he had problem in his category while he was just dominating the heavier guys? Maybe they were faster?
Oleg Zhokh: He says, I'm talking about before your accident, you were dominating superweights and everything, but sometimes in your own category you had such serious earnings and even sometimes you lost flashpins with such jokes. Maybe I didn't take my opponents seriously and relaxed, and because of that it turned out like that, or I was just careless.
Oleg Zhokh: Oleg is saying that mostly it was because of the underestimating his opponents and he was relaxed because it's his weight class, he felt too confident and he was not paying enough attention to what they're doing and that's why those... But I have a counter argument about that. When at the Zlotytur, when Mazgam beat him,
Host: And then after Mazgan beat him in the semi-final, Mazgan and Mantas Asmonas, they had a match like two minutes, two minutes long match. And Mazgan was finished. And in the final, he still gave Oleg about 20 seconds match, you know.
Host: It was in 2017.
Oleg Zhokh: In 2017 or 2016? I think it was in 2015. 2016. 2016, Oleg is saying. 2015. Because 40 days before that match,
Oleg Zhokh: I beat Mazgan Shamiyev with waffles. And then 40 days later, he just... Okay.
Oleg Zhokh: Yeah, he's saying that he got second after Pushkar. That was acceptable that I cannot win that one. I'm not sure.
Host: he was taking with pushkar what does it have to do with this because i don't know okay it's it's it was because it was overall overall is at the end of the event yes yes yeah anyways anyways so like thank you very much guys oleg you are probably one of the two
Host: Pound for pound, best left arm, if you are not the best. Like probably you and Malin Can are like the best in the history. And I hope that you come back, you come back to your best shape again.
Host: And we love you. We love you so much. And we wish you best. And before I close, one more question. Compared to his best, where is he now? Is he getting lost? Because he said he's coming back.
Oleg Zhokh: He says, we love you very much, Oleg, and he believes that there are two of you, and the strongest left-handed ones are you and Alizhan. He says he wants you to get back to us in your best form.
Oleg Zhokh: But I keep going, I keep doing it. I just have certain moments of trauma, and I train them all and return to the best form I can.
Oleg Zhokh: Okay, he immediately asked, how do you think, how are the processes of returning to the best form, where are you in the best possible way? In some moments I will no longer be in that form, but I am already preparing my new best form, I think I will do it.
Oleg Zhokh: Yeah, Oleg is saying that he's working on it and his injuries preventing for some some of the movements and he said I cannot bring The exact same form as I used to before but I am getting my new form My new best form ready and I will will achieve it very soon
Oleg Zhokh: He's saying that I'm gaining my new strong parts, which was not developed before. And did he say something about Alijan?
Host: No. David you guys know that I almost said Malin Can vs Oleg match but they didn't agree about the weight. Oleg wanted it to be, but I'm talking about three years ago, Oleg wanted it to be at 90 and Malin Can wanted it to be at 95.
Oleg Zhokh: They didn't agree, they both were stubborn, so I couldn't accept the match, you know. Anyways, yeah. Anyways, done. No, no, no. He just said that three years ago he was trying to make a match, but the two of them didn't agree and couldn't make it. They wanted me to perform in the 95 category, which would be a lot for me.
Oleg Zhokh: I know, I know, yes. Well, he just confirmed that it was. They tried. Well, I think I'll get to the category, well, maybe 80, well, I probably won't get close to 85, but I think it will be 95. I'll fight a little bit for 85, then I'll go for 95 and I'll be able to beat them there.
Oleg Zhokh: Oleg's saying that he will sit a little bit on 85 class and hopefully he will jump over to 95 and start winning in 95 class. Yeah, okay, okay. Daniel, my friend, thank you very, very much for being part of our podcast and Tiberiu, thank you for translating.
Host: daniel i i wish you the best with your plans like i always believe in big dreams if we are repeating ourselves and it's not fun anymore you need to do something that you haven't done before and uh not to be a boss or something but that's why i won't
Host: My dream was to win WAF in seven categories. I wanted to win 55, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85. But I had big, big, big injuries, big surgeries. I won 75 and stopped. 80, 85, I couldn't do it. But now I see you have a dream to win four world titles. And big respect, big respect to you. And I wish you the best, my friend. Thank you.
