Engin Terzi: Um, okay. You are not lagging, right? Yeah. Hope not. Yeah. Yeah. This, these ladies have been trying to find a place that connection is good. And I think we finally found it. And so how is everything? Let me, let me share this link on Facebook and then newsfeed. Emir, did you change the thumbnail?
Engin Terzi: Okay, I shared and now let's start. So how is everything going? It's going good. Great. Right now it's great. We're still friends here. Again, it's a little bit laggy, but it's okay. So how is the weight, Malin? Around 72 kilos. So you lost 400 grams more.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I weighed 71.9 when I left. Oh, okay, okay. Fia told me that, like, you guys are very close friends, even you are 75, she wouldn't mind. David she? I did, yeah. Wow. Yeah, see, you didn't know that. No, I didn't know that. She wouldn't do that? No. Yeah, anyway, so...
Engin Terzi: So, if it is not a wrong thing to ask, from which weight are you coming down? I know you pull Europeans at 80 kilos. Yeah, I was in 80 kilos. I was 80 kilos. In Slovakia, was it? Yeah. She's done a great job in a short time of...
Engin Terzi: It's so small, not intimidating at all now. Not at all? Yeah. So when the size is small, it's not intimidating? Does it count also for you? What was the question? No, I'm asking Fia because she thinks that you are not intimidating because you are smaller, but she is also small. Oh, yeah. Does it apply to her as well? Is she intimidating, Malin, because she's small?
Fia Reisek: She's so small right now. I think that she's weighing 60 kilos. But look at this. No, it doesn't look that big. Malin, it looks like you didn't really lose size from the muscles. No.
Engin Terzi: uh right under 70 kilo 69 oh you are 70 kilos so okay she was just joking when she said that you are so small look like 60 kilo okay yeah okay one second yeah and so
Engin Terzi: So you are 70 kilos and you are 72 kilos. You both almost made weight. I have a question. Last time, when you, okay, it was 2018, you won the World Wars in Antalya. Yeah. Was Fia in your category? Yes. Yes. Oh, okay. And the left arm, who won that? Gladkaya won? No, it was Oleg Slivchukkaya.
Engin Terzi: Oh, from Kazakhstan or Russia? Kazakhstan. Oh, Kazakhstan. Is this the girl that you pull in Romania? I don't remember, actually. It might be Tina. It was Oleg or Irina. I don't really remember. Sorry. Yeah. And in that competition, did you ladies meet each other? No.
Fia Reisek: Oh, you didn't meet. Okay, okay. She was so bad, so she laughed. I didn't have the chance to meet the champions. Oh, okay. Why was it, Fia? Why was it? Your form wasn't good that you didn't even really make plays? Like, did you get metal with right arm or no? Yeah, I got third and second in left. But I didn't think I was in a bad shape, but I pulled very badly.
Engin Terzi: I struggled in every match. I saw your ladies video pulling against each other at WL years ago. So my question, do you ladies know how many times officially you pulled against each other? No, we officially, like you mean international?
Fia Reisek: no no i mean like like how many times did you meet each other in a competition not training but the competition we we didn't meet that much we are you serious 25 years yeah yeah i know but we were in different the first couple of years i was so young and very uh i was not even good at all i was lost in every competition but we were in same category and then we faced each other
Fia Reisek: um yeah it was the first time marlin always won the first period and then she had a stop and then when she come back i won the competitions that we met yeah and then you won the loss okay we can say so last time you ladies meet was wl yeah yeah oh okay okay we haven't pulled that
Engin Terzi: And can you say, Fia, you have an unfinished business with her? Yes, definitely. This is actually
Fia Reisek: sorry sorry now no but this i really wanted this match it is super scary and and it's um like the worst thing but the best match i could ever dream of really okay yeah so one second
Engin Terzi: And so right now you are the left arm East versus West world champion. Yeah. And, and now, um, I think, I think we don't have anyone. I don't think so. Yeah, we don't have anyone. Uh, Barbara won one arm. Gabriella has the other one and 80 kilo only.
Engin Terzi: Right arm, we didn't have the left arm, world title match. And 70 kilo, you are left arm champion. Right arm, we don't have anyone. And 60 kilo, Dimitrina. And even in the male categories, there is nobody right and left arm. Yeah. And Marlene, do you think that it will continue to be that way? That no one will have the double titles? Yeah, no one will.
Engin Terzi: have no one will right yeah i mean at least till you start with pulling it left arm right no but but now when you're saying this she will be like okay more fired up for this competition so why did you are afraid of that i'm sorry i'm sorry i didn't want to put you in trouble okay okay so she she she says that no one will have that do you agree with that fear no i don't agree with that
Engin Terzi: She doesn't know what she's talking about, right? Yeah. Yeah. Because of the weight loss, so much water loss and everything. Yeah. Yeah. She doesn't know what she, that's what I was thinking. What's that? She's dizzy in her head because of the weight loss and loss of carbs. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So in fact, you know, if she was healthy,
Engin Terzi: She would say that, yes, Fia will be the first one to have the double belts. Yeah, she would. That's not healthy to say if you're in a match with somebody. That's insane. So I'm the sane person here. She's insane, as we all know. Yeah, yeah. I'm just trying to steer the boat, yeah. Anyway, so this is a revenge opportunity for Fia.
Engin Terzi: and also another uh opportunity to win a world title plus to become a double champion in the category while mali you don't want to give her the opportunity no no you want you want every everything to you even you even ask me about the elbow pet size you know like you know how you're gonna hit the side way
Engin Terzi: with driving your elbow, right? That was why, right? I just need to be as prepared as I can. I want to know everything. So that's a good thing though, that it's bigger. Yeah. I love the example that I see that like you both are very close friends and this kind of match doesn't put any
Engin Terzi: any negative thing, you know, between you two, but I know that when you go that stage, then you won't be the best friends out there, you know. We know that too. Yeah. I couldn't do this. I couldn't do that. I would be a friend with inside of me. I wouldn't be really smiling so much, but yeah. Yeah. It's a good example. Yeah. And so,
Engin Terzi: So you ladies don't know how many times who beat who, but you only know that last time Malin won on February 15th. How excited are you, Malin? This is your first match and then it's a world title match and you deserve it. You just won the Europeans in a dominant fashion.
Fia Reisek: I'm so honored to be in this match. Like, it's the toughest match that I could have in the first quest too. And to do, you know, to come there the first time to have this, a world title match is like, I'm so honored. It's gonna be a competition so many times to watch it and work there. But this time I'm on the stage.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, it's going to be awesome. How many times did you go up the stage? I remember a few times you put the belt in or you helped for the belt. How many times? You don't remember, right? But a few times. Maybe like I have been there five times or four. Really? Yeah. I think every time. Yeah. I have felt the atmosphere. That's good, too, for the preparation that I have been there so many times.
Fia Reisek: But now it's in Georgia, I don't know how the hotel is or where the arena, how it looks. And yeah, that's a bit scary. I love to be prepared for how it looks, how everybody will sit and will it be warm inside, cold inside. I'm a nerd. David you think any moment that you were on the stage that
Engin Terzi: Maybe someday? I hope. Yeah. Yeah, you did. Yeah, yeah. Every time. Me too, me too. But I can't go there. It's just like too busy to organize. I can't, you know, like, I don't know. It's just hard to focus on two things in the same time, you know, yeah. And what do you think about FIA? Like FIA, in my opinion, is like egg lead, 80 kilo.
Engin Terzi: And Barbara in Supers, you know, just like Fia is that dominant, especially last every year. She's like very dominant, very dangerous. I can't think anything more dangerous. Yeah. And like, I know you have your game plan. I know you both know each other. When you say that, you don't remember how many times you officially pull, but I'm sure that you train probably thousands of times. Is that correct?
Engin Terzi: yeah and and you know each other like more than anyone else yeah and so yeah yeah yeah yeah and and right now you both exactly know what is your best move what's your chance so
Engin Terzi: Do you think that one of us has a chance to do more than one thing? Do you think there is more than one way, Malin, to beat you? Or only one way? No, Malin. Was that a question to me?
Engin Terzi: What's that? Was it my question? Should I answer? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I asked you, do you think that Malin can beat you more than one way? Because I have seen you ladies training. I have seen the WL match. It looked like, you know, like the same thing. But you know her better than I do, for sure. Do you think that she has the only single weight? No, she definitely has two big...
Fia Reisek: things, weapons that I fear a lot. If she gets in those positions, I don't think I can do anything. And apart from them, I think she will be a warrior on the table. But those specific positions she gets are very hard to get out from.
Engin Terzi: for me and and and she knows that you know them as well like you both know like like you there is nothing to hide right i i know yeah i i told you actually did you yeah this is what i'm saying yeah yeah and it is same thing applies for you right malin like you know how she can beat you
Fia Reisek: Yes, I know how she can beat me. We know everything right, like before we started to train for this match. And then maybe she has changed some things because she has Yannis Amelins as a trainer too, and they both know my weaknesses. So I am sure that she has trained a lot, for an example, to stop my hit strength-wise,
Engin Terzi: probably stopping my hit is something that they have been training and she's nodding yeah that one i know your hit but she said two i don't know what's the other one i have no idea oh are you serious wow i don't know what it means i think i have one way to to win um
Fia Reisek: No, it's the... Should I tell you? I told you already. No, I forgot. You didn't see. It's the press. If she got like... Someone stops her in her hit, she still doesn't... It's not like she keep up there. Then she have like a shoulder press pulling style. Do you realize that, Priya? She's playing like...
Engin Terzi: naive you know like i only have one way she's trying to make you forget about that one you see how sneaky she is that's yeah that's deadly yeah yeah yeah yeah and and and malin how many ways fear has to beat you no way oh yeah that's that that is good no no no but
Fia Reisek: Come on, stop being nice. Tell us how you feel. I'm super scared of this match. I know her strength. She's like a strength puller. She's very...
Fia Reisek: she thinks that i can press her um or that that could happen but i mean i have done that to other people that doesn't arm wrestle the same way as fia arm wrestles so i understand what she means with the press but it has been a taller girls um
Fia Reisek: that i don't think is as strong as via pound to pound and they don't have the same control in their wrists as he has so i think um that my press um yeah i mean it totally depends you know the position you may hit she may stop you like this and then then the moment you can do it yeah yeah yeah yeah that that's what and also
Engin Terzi: Like that, that is very interesting that in my opinion, that, that, like there is one more lady from Sweden in the same exact category as far as I know, and also is a big danger. And that, that, that, that, who knows, you know, who knows maybe someday. Yeah. Elin Janaheim.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I remember when she was like 14 or 15 was just really within the 18 years old category. And yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, that, that, that, that will be, that will be very interesting. Yeah. Um, yeah. What's that? What do you think about this match? Yeah. You have to tell us who will win. I'm organized.
Engin Terzi: I know, but still. I can't. Listen, I can't take sides. No matter how much I hate you, Malin, I can't take sides. I'm joking. Yeah. Anyways, yeah. So, let's see. Let's see how it will be. And do you think, like, do you agree that
Engin Terzi: like how to say about 70 kilo the things are like very different you know we have we have barbara who twice defeated uh gabriella we have gabriella and who i think one in wl and one in the king of table twice defeated sarah
Engin Terzi: And then we, we, or Egle. Like, like there is, there is like Gabriela and then there is Egle. And then we have Egle and then, then we have Sara. Like those look like far from each other. Like whenever I watch Egle versus Sara, I mean, I, I was very, very surprised, like very surprised, especially in the final round she went inside.
Engin Terzi: and still won, I was like, wow, you know, but, but because of her weight, Egle is also not, it didn't look so close to the Gabriela and Barbara. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so do you agree that there is, there is like, like kind of like. Yeah.
Fia Reisek: definitely yeah yeah yeah it's really hard at that weight to find some there is probably a lot of uh good females out there who could do something but they are so like dominant um these girls like what what what what irina makeva comes as strong as she used to be to 80 kilo yeah that then then then the she versus eggler would be like
Engin Terzi: Do you think that Irina could be a danger for today's Gabriela or Barbara? Because they pulled with Gabriela, but Gabriela was much... Exactly 70 kilos. 70, 80, around it. I think one time they pulled in
Fia Reisek: one Russian event in mid-2010s, you know? Yes. Yeah. I would think he would have a hard time. Best Irina Makeva back then to Gabi right now, because Gabi is stronger than ever. So I think that Gabi would win. But then again, Irina...
Fia Reisek: maybe had to train even harder because that is what Gabi has done all the time. She wanted to be the best in the world. So she has kept on training, kept on getting much stronger. So it would be cool if Marina Makeva came back. Were you ladies surprised that Gabriela
Fia Reisek: in early round beating Barbora? David you guys expect something closer or did you expect Barbora dominance? I did not expect that Gabi would win that easy the first round. It was not super easy, but it looked like
Fia Reisek: yeah she was in control and then yes she had to control the whole fight and and also the same fight uh we were right yeah it was a very good match huh very good match it was a good match i actually said that gabriella would win twice i said that before the match so i was uh right but but it looked so easy the first times and then because it looked so easy and then the third round
Engin Terzi: Yeah, she couldn't do much after that. Last time they met, wasn't it the same that she won twice? Exactly the same. Yeah, first two rounds she won, yeah. But this time, she kind of like a little bit lost hand, but still had the pronator, so she was able to... I think if somebody wants to beat Gabriela, they need to control her pronator, but not in a hook way, but just, you know, that way, yeah. And...
Engin Terzi: because her side pressure, if she has that pronator, her side pressure with wrist or without wrist is very strong. Very strong. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that, that, that, that, that is very, very interesting. You know, woman category, I see like in super heavyweight, I don't see anyone close to those two ladies. And then when you come to 80 kilo,
Engin Terzi: No disrespect to anyone, but Agde looks like, I mean, she looks unbeatable in that category. And then 70 kilo ladies are there. And maybe some of them are coming. Like last year, Fia, I was very curious about your match against Uzbekistan girl. But then when I saw you ladies, especially in strap, the difference was huge. Because the year before, she dominated everyone in Kazakhstan.
Engin Terzi: Were you surprised to beat her that easy? Yeah, I'm always surprised when I get a win. I mean, were you surprised to, like, did you expect a tougher match? If you remember, I was planning to set a world title match between you and her. Yes. And then when you said that you're going to pull 70 kilos, I was like, oh, beautiful matches.
Engin Terzi: now yeah and then and when i saw how dominant you were then then i realized that it wouldn't be a tough world title national yeah and and do you ladies see anyone else in 70 kilo there could be a threat
Fia Reisek: Oh my God, I think in 70 Kilo there is a lot of girls. I think it depends much on the shape of the day for us. If we put every lady that we thought is super strong together in one class, it would be like you could never... Or it could be different each time we met each other, even if it's close to...
Engin Terzi: to other competitions. I think we are quite equal in 70. You are out of your mind. She doesn't understand. She doesn't understand how good she is. She's just going there and dominating. She's still saying, I think it is depending on the day. Like, which day? I mean, every day you're winning, you know? I mean...
Fia Reisek: What are you talking about? Do you not realize what you are doing the last few years? I lose also. Yeah, that's the thing. I go to competition and I am surprised that I lose and then I am surprised that I win.
Engin Terzi: I don't know. I think like, I mean, you and I, we probably seen something different, but just
Fia Reisek: I trust your judgment more than mine, you know, since it's about you. But she's surprised because sometimes she goes into competitions without... Sometimes she hasn't planned to go to those competitions, but she's there and then she's like going into the heaviest weight class and then she has lost a match to somebody that is really strong. I think with left arm maybe, but the right arm looks pretty dominant in the last few years, you know.
Engin Terzi: I think you lost a match against a girl from Latvia? Yeah, in left arm, yeah, in Norway. Yeah, one round you lost in Norway, I think. I think the same girl. Yeah. What's up? Who is this guy? Who is this guy? You missed your wrist pin tap roll? Come here. Anyways, yeah. So, what was your name? Santa or what was...
Engin Terzi: Yeah, her left arm is very strong. I think she and Carolina had a war, right? The Europeans or? Yeah. Hello, hello, hello. Her left arm is good, right? Very good. Her left arm was really good. I think she's stronger than me, I guess. David they not have a war, like a very long war?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, a very long match. But I think after the Europeans, she didn't train. I think if she is healthy and if she focuses, I think she has a very good future. I mean, I say this because I want really good competition in that category. And if there is someone with potential, I think we need that person.
Fia Reisek: She has more to give than at that time because she didn't arm wrestle for so long. But she has climbing background and everything like that. So her grip, her form, she just needs some more adjustments, I think. You ladies are very humble, you know. She had a long match and she's saying that she normally was better, you know. This is very humble. And Karuna, what's your weight? 62. 62.
Engin Terzi: And what do you think about your chances against these ladies? At 70 kilos? At 70. Yeah, because we have 60 or 70. I don't think they are going down to 60. There is only one way.
Fia Reisek: you're crazy listen at 70 i think that they are dominant i think that they might be at the level of like sarah uh that that is my uh estimation uh they are not uh how about you your chance just if you gain a little bit weight just think you are 67 kilo i would have to gain like
Fia Reisek: many kilos of muscle to be... But as of now, you couldn't do anything to them, you think? No, when Fia was 65, like one year ago or one half year ago, it was different. But when she is 70, I don't think so. When you say it was different, what do you mean?
Engin Terzi: I felt like I felt possible closer to her when she was five but it's not it's not the same like uh-huh yeah yeah yeah and and what what did Fia and Malin think about your match against Dimitrina Fia you start what did you think where do you think that Carolina
Engin Terzi: made mistake or is it was there any mistake it was only power difference or endurance difference round one in step she lost the risk but let me ask for first carolina why did you lose that match you think in your opinion um i think it was several things but one was that my confidence was uh very low uh why why
Fia Reisek: Because I met, I, you know, when I had my break from arm wrestling, like nine years, I saw her come up and I always saw her as the best. So when I came back, she was the girl that I was like, Oh, she's unbeatable in this weight category. And also it's the right arm. So, so I was trying to tell my mind all the time, uh,
Fia Reisek: trying to give myself better confidence, so I went in with it, and I wasn't really able to switch my confidence. Okay, then let's go round one. You took a risk and in the strap. Then what happened? I think that in that round, she was so strong, so even though I had some pronation, she was able to draw me with her back,
Fia Reisek: uh she drew my angle out i i kept the finisher but she she she pulled was able to pull me out so that's what happened and then in the second round i felt bad in the strap so i didn't really feel like i was able to do anything and
Fia Reisek: You know, normally with my setup, I like to put my leg on the other side, but it's not like a mountain or to do before the go. So I didn't really get that back pressure. Then in third round, I actually felt like that was the best one because I had some pronation and I still had some pressure side because I stayed higher. But then she just all the time, you know, cool, then my elbow went off. And then not good.
Fia Reisek: Do you think her endurance was better than yours? Maybe. Maybe my hit, my explosiveness was only good like a short time. Like the explosive hits. So I couldn't do that first hit again. What's wrong with your endurance?
Fia Reisek: Then your explosiveness, I mean. Yeah, maybe. Mm.
Fia Reisek: Maybe the endurance wasn't worse. I started with a bit bad confidence. It didn't get better. Stepping out of this match, I feel a lot better for the future because now I'm like, okay, maybe I have some points to work on and I feel like there is a way. So it was like I needed that too. So in the future, you want another shot?
Fia Reisek: Yeah, but I need time, of course. It's not like... But of course, I even want to maybe go back to 60, because I want to meet her. Yeah, okay. I understand. And you know what to do now? I'm not saying that you will beat her or not, but do you know at least... What did you learn from that match? Yeah...
Fia Reisek: I learned that I can pronate her and that I can keep some side pressure. In some ways, in the third round, I found positions where I felt like I could put side against her side, even though she's an inside puller.
Fia Reisek: when i stayed high and kept some formation it was really okay to like go that way and i didn't expect that and also maybe that i was too afraid so i always got to the trap and i never tried to like go more straight across like ayana did i was like more powerful than me so maybe that wouldn't work but i should have at least like tried that because the between his strap cooler and she will of course be able to get the hook better if you just
Engin Terzi: another question just think that if she is just like she pulls 60 but she's walking around 63 and if she wanted to try 70 kilo does she have any chance uh with these girls whoever is the champion who's that talking there no it was terence he said hi yeah hello hello terence yeah
Fia Reisek: Maybe. I have thought so previously. I do really think that if she gets to her position, it would be hard even for these girls. But that is my personal opinion based on my previous experiences and my picture of her. Question for Fia. You beat her, right, at WL? Yeah.
Fia Reisek: Yeah. And she beat you one round and then you beat her two rounds? Yeah, she won the first match. And do you remember your weight and her weight at that time or no? I think she was lighter than 60 kilo. Wasn't she pulling in 55? Yeah. So she might be in 58. 58, 59 maybe? She was very light, yeah. And I was 65 maybe, yeah. 65, okay. So even then she was a little bit lighter than you, okay. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, maybe, maybe, yeah. At some point, Malin or Fia would be good against her. We would have her. I love Dimitrina. She's a great person and I would love to see. An amazing all wrestler. Yeah, amazing. Yeah, yeah. People think that she's just strong, but she's technically a master as well. She's so good, yeah. Very smart girl, very smart girl with no emotions, nothing, you know, you know, like,
Engin Terzi: You can put the same photo of her and you can say, Dimitriina happy, Dimitriina upset, Dimitriina angry. It's the same person, you know. And Malin, do you want Dimitriina to be your first belt title defence match after FIA? If Dimitriina wants to go up to 70, she's welcome.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I'm just teasing Fia by saying that. I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's more teasing me by saying that than teasing Molly. Molly will get fired from that and I'll be scared. You both are scared of each other. You both are scared of something that you both know very well, it looks like. Yeah. There's something in the training you got experience a lot of times, it looks like.
Fia Reisek: Fia has been flashed 5,000 times by Malin, and Malin got stopped by Fia 5,000 times and lost. So you both know, and they both are curious which one is going to happen. Yeah, that is exactly how it is. Exactly, yeah. We don't want it to be like, we want it to be a fight so that it's not going in like four exactly the same matches.
Fia Reisek: um but we have never had a long fight either you pin me or i have one yeah never long matches we got into scraps yeah pouring in but hopefully now yeah money you say hopefully no and fiasco says yes yes so i said hopefully now
Engin Terzi: Oh, I said now. Okay, okay. I thought that you said hopefully no strap and I thought that Fia said yes. And I don't think that Fia wants that. Fia wants strap much. I want strap. She wants straps. Yeah. Yeah, she wants strap, yeah. I don't want straps though. I know, I know, I know, I know. Explosiveness versus...
Fia Reisek: Power, I should say, I don't know, but to say what, yeah, it will be a good match, yeah. Let's see who will be leaving that stage with the belt on. Yeah. Can't wait to know. It has been very mentally draining for us to do this match, like, because we're friends. So it will be fun when it's over, too. We have decided to go to a...
SPEAKER_02: you say a cabin cabin in the forest in the forest alone after the match just relaxing chilling oh really trying to be friends again yeah yeah don't don't don't do that in georgia so we don't know what is in there you look fabulous you look 10 years younger i i i know i know i know just joking
Engin Terzi: Let's talk about the card. David you ladies like the card? Yes, oh my god, yeah. What are your favorite matches? Rematch, Devon, Genadi. Rematch, Devon, Genadi. It was a tough match they had last time, right? Yeah, but not everyone can be a champion.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, everyone can be a champion. And it was like controversial discussions and they are on each other, right? So. It was a wonderful match. It was a wonderful match. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. Yeah. Listen, like the tickets are, I mean, just selling like, I mean, crazy. I think the atmosphere in Georgia will be crazy. And I just, I just can't wait.
Engin Terzi: Karoline, are you coming with them or not? No, because we have a qualification competition that week, like for the Europeans and so on. So I guess. Oh, you and Fia and Malin, they will not be qualified for Europe? No. Are you serious? Oh. No, no, no. Listen, we will probably solve this.
Fia Reisek: Because we don't have that many in 70 kilos that competes for WAF. So we see this match as a qualification for the world. Who will get the spot. Yeah, who will get the spot. And we try to make them say yes. It won't be a problem. Karolina, are you still in the disciplinary thing?
Fia Reisek: Yes. Are you serious? They didn't, I didn't get any more information yet. I made a statement. It was on October 26, but I didn't hear anything back yet. So I still don't know the status of that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways. Yeah. I hope, I hope everything will be solved and there will be no problem. You are one of the elite, elite athletes and,
Engin Terzi: and your country should only be proud of you. Thank you. Yeah, anyway, so who is winning? Who is winning, Devon or Genadi? I think Devon will win this time. And last time, who did you think that was going to win? Devon, I think. I think I thought that too last time.
Fia Reisek: It's but the thing is that Devon can't really go into his head. So again, I cannot use that. Yeah, I agree. They cannot is like, listen, you
Engin Terzi: Ladies know Genadi probably more than Devon knows because all those European wars, you know, Genadi is not someone to intimidate. I don't think there is any human being on this earth that can intimidate Genadi, no matter who you are, you know, you may win, but you are not going to intimidate that guy.
Engin Terzi: And you are saying that Devon will not be successful, but... No, no, no, with that, with the mental game. No, no, that's what I am saying. He will not be successful with the intimidation. No, so he has to change his game plans in that way. He should depend on... Because if he goes there and if he cannot be successful, it will be in maybe opposite effect. Yeah.
Fia Reisek: But, yeah, he also gains weight now, Devon, again. And he's super strong. But, yeah, it will be a tough match, but I also think Devon will win. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree. I think it will be a tough match. Because Devon is talking about, again, making Genadi give up.
Engin Terzi: yeah so that i don't know if how good the idea is it's not my uh my business but that that that that was the reason what happened last time yeah because devon started like this and then if you realize that he he wanted to win quick with the shoulder pressure last time he didn't really try to tire him you know as he claimed you know except around one so
Engin Terzi: He says this, but I don't think he will try to do that. But Genadi wants him to kiss his... They both want. Every time Genadi does that, they want us to do the same thing. They both are very... I don't know how to say. Different, anyways. Very different. I didn't say that. You ladies said it, but you are right.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but listen, listen, I'm one of them, so everything is OK. Yeah, we are too. You also you all three as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, I agree. I agree. But we have some degrees. Some are more, some are less. I'm I'm middle. Do you think fear is there about being cracked?
Engin Terzi: above. Oh, Malin is above, okay. And you, Karolina, where are you? Oh my gosh, she's even higher. She's outside the limit. You can't even see her. Okay, okay. So our nursing world at the elite level is a crazy hospital. That's a Swedish secret. Yeah. What's that? The Swedish secret to success. Listen, about being crazy, I mean,
Engin Terzi: i'm not so intimidated you know so every day i look at mirror you know i see much more than this so anyways so okay let's go to other matches um who's who's who's winning brett grandy or basho saginashvili i i think uh
Engin Terzi: Do you know how you ladies are now? It is like those TV programs that there are some questions and there are teams that they talk and make the answers. No, I'm asking your all independent opinion. You don't need to discuss with each other. But I had to ask her what his name was, how you pronounce his name. I couldn't tell.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I couldn't say the last name. So she said Bacho was. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I thought that you, you guys were deciding together, you know? Okay. Yeah. Brett Grundy, Brett Grundy has beaten Paolo and Brett Grundy at the Challenger Series, he beat Matt Mask and confident. So Brett Grundy is not someone to underestimate for sure, but we also know that Bacho is very, very strong guy. So.
Engin Terzi: And we think that all matches you put together are very tight-knit matches. Yeah, very close. So, basically, we know that every match, it's hard. But it doesn't always go like this. It doesn't always go like this. I do my best. But sometimes, you know, you need to set different matches. It doesn't happen. Because arm wrestling, nature. Like, for example, Fia, I set your match with Malin. And Malin is going to flash ping you three times. So, I mean, I make mistakes as well.
Fia Reisek: Yeah, but that will be a surprise. It will be a surprise? Okay. For me too. A good surprise. You don't mind, right, when I joke like this? No, no, no. No, no, you know that I'm not serious. What were you saying, Caro?
Fia Reisek: No, you know, we have this super heavyweight guy in Sweden, Filip, he had a match with Brad on the, like, Florida event. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And he looked very dominant against Brad. He's a lot heavier, of course, it's not the same weight as Kevin. Yeah, yeah. But I think it was, like, Brad stopped pulling.
Engin Terzi: because of her education and had some health problems and then just come and then try with him first i'm not saying that normally he would beat him or something but probably he wasn't at his best shape probably he was still loose but the guy is also huge guy as far as i heard you know
Fia Reisek: But also, I think that Philip has really tall arms and strong, so maybe he couldn't get power in because it's very difficult to pull. So now when he has a smaller, I mean, shorter arm to pull against, then he probably will get everything that he usually, where he's from. But also the Georgians, super strong, they will be in their country. So...
Fia Reisek: I do believe Basia would win this, but I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We are just discussing. We don't know what's going to happen, you know. And were you ladies surprised Irina Gladke lost in the last event? Not surprised. I wasn't. You want to start? Yeah, you can start. I was not surprised that she lost because Irina has been in the sport for so long.
Fia Reisek: and she hasn't been competing as much. And I know that Ivanović, she was hard and she has always been on the Europeans and the Worlds. But I thought it was going to be a more close match. I mean, with the score, it was close. It was 3-2. And then who had the buckle? Yeah, that's true. That's true. It was very... Yeah, they were...
Fia Reisek: I thought that Irina was gonna win just because of her like experience in arm wrestling and all the titles that like she has from before she's beaten like all of the best in that weight category and of course they didn't like train as much now but she seems active she's posting on Instagram she's doing arm wrestling movements she's pulling so I think it was but but I
Engin Terzi: I thought it was going to be close, but still I expected Irina to win, but I'm not surprised that Ivanfi could do it. Stoyan Golemanov versus Vasily Dautashvili. You ladies know Vasily from the European and World Championships. Vasily Dautashvili, maybe, if you remember. Stoyan Golemanov. Hello, Neil. How are you? Powerful!
Fia Reisek: Okay. That's the craziest of all. And Stoyan, the top row master versus another master from Georgia, Vasily Dautashvili. So when did Stoyan go? He was in the early East versus West competition, no?
Engin Terzi: Not early, but when you say early, not the beginning of the East vs West, but the earlier ones. He pulled against Brandon Elsester, and he won. Yeah. And he is like, back in the day, he was really, or he probably is now, I don't know, but he was like one of the best in Bulgaria. The best, maybe. One of the best in the world, in his category. One of the best, yeah. From Bulgaria.
Engin Terzi: oh yeah yeah you're right you're right yeah so i don't know i i hope for him to win because it feels like he's from my when i uh arm wrestled a long time ago from your generation yeah from my generation and yeah yeah yeah she she is also 35 years old yeah so i shouldn't say that sorry i should never mention your age yeah
Fia Reisek: okay and so who's winning you want to win in the carolina i don't have enough knowledge of this match but i also hope for someone to win but it's in georgia so it's um it's uh difficult for the their opponents yeah uh
Engin Terzi: Neil Pickup said that she is old. If he is there, just catch him and beat him up. Yeah, I will. I will catch him later. Where did he go? Put him in the snow. Yeah, we're going to kick his ass after this. Yeah, yeah, all together, just beat him up, yeah. Anyway, so let's go. Let's go other matches. What do you think about Fia Isaac versus Malin?
Engin Terzi: Bergström. You have to answer this. Should I answer? Do you want to? Listen, listen. Do you feel safe and secure, you know? Not just blink three times, you know? Yes. I do.
Fia Reisek: uh okay i have discussed this with a lot of people and we have talked quite openly about it yesterday i mean mindy gave you his prediction and so on but everybody is saying like the same things it's uh pretty much marlin's explosiveness against fia's strength and so it's not a rocket science you know so everyone knows the possibilities
Fia Reisek: Yeah, yeah, but I do believe, based on their last match, Malin won, the last super fight that I had, but it was only three rounds. Was it five years ago, six years ago? And I think that maybe, probably, Thea has developed more since then than what Malin has. But at that point, Malin even beat her in the strap.
Fia Reisek: So Fia probably had more progress. I think she has gotten a lot stronger. Malin also, of course, stronger, but maybe not like saying progress. But I do think that Malin's explosiveness will be hard to handle. But I do think that Fia will take some rounds and Malin will take some rounds.
Fia Reisek: But I think that it might be like the explosive color that will take it. But I've heard some very knowledgeable people saying that probably one or two rounds for Malin and then it's over. Minde, for example, he was very clear. Very clear, but he has strength, so yeah. Okay, okay. Sorry to interrupt. It's okay.
Neil Pickup: I'm sorry. Sorry, everybody. Sorry, everybody. I just found this old-age pension and bus pass somewhere around here. I'm just wondering who this might belong to. Oh, Marlene. Thank you. The room keys, we have lost them. We only got one left, so it's good to have one back. Okay, so...
Fia Reisek: Daniel Prokopcik versus Oleg Zhokh. Yeah. I like this match. I like when it's a little bit lighter guys pulling. And I think they are... It will be like more technical war maybe.
Fia Reisek: Daniel is much lighter, right? I think he will be around 81, 82 while Oleg 85. But he's coming from another weight category. He's not coming from 80 kilo category. I think Daniel off season is always around 80.
Fia Reisek: Okay, okay, okay. But I still, I think that, like, it's good for Daniel to get the challenge in the left, because he needs it, because he's so dominant. But I think that Oleg might be too heavy, too high a weight category for Daniel to handle. It is hard to beat Oleg already, and it is hard to be lighter and beat Oleg.
Fia Reisek: I think Oleg is so specific with his arm and pull very much, almost like 100% with his arm. Daniel have both arms pulling and maybe not developed the specific technique like Oleg have with his body and his arms. I think Oleg will win.
Fia Reisek: But Daniel's left is really good. Yeah, very good. Do you ladies expect a dominant win or some resistance? No, lots of war, I'm hoping for. I think dominant for Oleg. I also think that it will be hard for Daniel to get some real resistance. But I hope that he will...
Engin Terzi: Were you ladies surprised when Toms won one round against Oleg at the Europeans?
Fia Reisek: yeah yes when when you watched it from like the audience it looked insane yeah but then when you see it afterwards you don't really know like if alex maybe was relaxing a bit because he thought that he was uh in the in the pin pad i'm not sure but still thoms did good oh yeah yeah i don't i don't think i don't think that it was just like that because even one of the rounds that oleg wants still was some struggle yeah it was yeah yeah so thoms is very good
Fia Reisek: Yeah, he's very good. And even better in his right now, I think. But in his left, he did get some, I mean, that huge hand and that huge forearm that Oleg had. He did get some connection and almost like took some control and Oleg had to struggle to get out of it. So it was really good. And he will probably in the future one day beat him, I think so. Frank Lamparelli versus Serhii Kalinichenko.
Fia Reisek: 115 kilo. Is Frank 115 kilo? Yeah, he has been. I believe Frank will win. Why? Just because he has impressed. He has got some tough matches at East vs West and he has been impressive in all of them. Yeah.
Fia Reisek: I think people didn't believe in him. I don't remember who he was set to pull first, but I remember that people didn't have a lot of faith in him. He beat Mad Mask, and then he had a war against Michael Todd, a big war, and he lost.
Fia Reisek: He pulled against Dave Chaffee, but it wasn't really his category. In one of the rounds, he took his wrist, but Dave was able to press him with the dead wrist, yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, Frank is my favorite in this match. But didn't you say before that you thought Kalashenko would win? No, I did not. I'm rooting for Frank. I'm rooting for Frank, but I think that he will win.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so let's go to the next one. Betkili Onianii versus Oleg Petrenko at 95 kilos. Wow. I will tell you ladies something. Since you ladies are also from where I am from, that's what I mean is WAF and Europeans.
Engin Terzi: You know, all the superstars that we see at the East versus West are actually the guys that we have pulled together in the same event for years and years and years. So it just shows how tough WAF has been, but not really known, you know, like how tough. It is just like now Neil calls East versus West Jurassic Park. In fact, a few Western pullers,
Engin Terzi: waff was the like when i say if you accept a few of those guys that john bersing and they come and join endeavor waff has been jurassic park for decades you know yeah yeah yeah but people people didn't know that because it wasn't that stage that big that you know yeah fancy you know stage but they all deserve this yes but they even even waffles incredibles
Engin Terzi: But what I'm just saying that when it is more like show, then it takes more attention. But just I am telling you, ladies and everyone, some people may have problems with WAF because of this reason, that reason. Like I'm repeating again, WAF is the most important thing. Yes.
Engin Terzi: but most important from like 15 years old 18 years old 23 women men and like that is a factory arm wrestling factory that everyone is coming look at all those east west champions you know i mean like i mean they all are from there except a few when i say except even devon has pulled there even john has pulled there michael has pulled there many times you know and so in fact you know that that
Engin Terzi: No matter what we feel about certain things, we need to make sure that WAF exists. And it exists and it is strong already. And I hope it always continues that way because that is the future. I'm not making a political speech. It has nothing to do with comparing this and that. I'm just saying that I see a lot of people are talking bad.
Engin Terzi: you may have a problem with the management or something but that just make it separate issue then all those countries that compete in there that their sweat and they all those people from countless countries thousands of people every year is just uh coming different people of course coming and like turkish national championships we had 1700 competitors last year 1700 can you believe that we had like how many tables
Engin Terzi: 20 tables or something we had, you know, like, I don't know, maybe you ladies saw the photo, you know, and yeah, yeah. So it is growing. And I talked with all the, all the countries and they say that their participant numbers are growing at the nationals every year. Yeah. I think they had, I think Carolina, maybe you competed there. One of the Swiss Opens, I think ended like some 3 AM in the morning or 4 AM. It was at five.
Engin Terzi: It was 5 a.m. You were there, right? You were there, yeah. Yeah, that's all I'm saying. The armwrestling is just, attention is growing, you know. Anyway, so let's talk about Bet Kili and Petrenko. Yeah, okay, so Bet Kili is normally lighter, right? It's a 105-kilo match, or?
Engin Terzi: 95 kilos. It's 95. Okay, it's 95. Okay. So they're the same weight. It was just because Oleg was coming. I mean, they will be the same weight at the weigh-in. I can guarantee about the next day, like how Devon was 105. He just weighed in front of me and probably he was 117. So the one that's coming from down, Petrenko, I don't know what he will weigh next day. Okay. So normally Oleg will be in a higher weight category.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he was 105 kilo right arm champion and with left arm he gave very good match to Malin Canmurado. By the way, when I say Malin Canmurado, what do you ladies think about this monster? Yeah, love him. Incredible, right? Incredible.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, when I saw he versus Matyshenko up there, I didn't love anything. Round one, they suck like this. I was like, wow, just life stopped there. I was like, wow. Yeah, we saw it. You are a witness in history. Anyway, so I'm sorry. I'm asking a question, and I'm changing. Petrenko versus Betkili. Betkili.
Fia Reisek: I think that Keeley will win because he can pull both like top roll or half hook or so he's good. He's a very versatile. Yeah. Arm wrestler. And yeah, he has been super impressive like his previous matches. I thought that because he came from lightweight, so I didn't expect him to be as impressive in that in this weight category. But he
Fia Reisek: We're changing the person holding the camera. Oh, there is a person holding, yeah, okay. Was Karolina with left hand? Yeah. It's my strongest, but now it's out of power, so. Yeah. No, no, he's so impressive, but he's still, he struggled a bit with Oleg. I'm not sure. I think it will be a war. Yeah. Okay.
Engin Terzi: And Malin and Fia? No, I think Beth Keighley will win. Yeah, you said Beth Keighley. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I also think Beth Keighley. Beth Keighley? Okay, whenever I ask this question, whenever you ladies answer, how much is it about who you want and how much is it who you think? That's a good question, but I think that
Fia Reisek: Okay. I do want him to win. It's very, very hard for me, but I do think because he's so, I think that he's more, I don't know this, but I think that he's more technical. He's a very smart arm wrestler and he can pull in so many different ways and has a tall arm. And so I do think that he will win this match, but, but I am not, I have no idea. It's tough.
Fia Reisek: I want him to win. He's like one of my favourite colours to watch right now. And also like how easily Devon beat Oleg makes you think that maybe... Yeah, but listen, Devon is like the guy that just beat many other guys like Ermes and some other guys, you know, he beat Denis Siplenko, he beat Georgi Svetko and...
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so let's go to the next one. David Dadikyan versus Alex Kurdecha. Normally, people know David Dadikyan being 105 kilos, but David right now is over 120 kilos. Okay. Maybe you ladies remember when he was only 114 kilos.
Engin Terzi: He almost beat Artur Morozov. He was winning 3-0, and then from there he lost 4-3. He won the first three rounds. So, especially if he is over 120 kilos, a guy with left arm can be dangerous for anyone. But, what can he do against Alex Kurdecha, who is about 203, 203 centimeters. And...
Fia Reisek: 160 kilo at least like how that match would go we were discussing this before and david i think he's now when you're also saying that he has a gain weight i do think that he can win i guess but but this is not from my heart because i would like alex uh he's my
Fia Reisek: Yeah, we have been to many competitions again, so I want him to win, but this will be a close match. I think David will win, especially considering the weight gain. But I don't know a lot about that. There is still a 40 kilo difference between those two. 40 kilo and almost 20 centimeters.
Fia Reisek: difference. But I think anyway, I changed. Okay, Alex, I don't change mine. Okay, so let's go to the next one. We go. Okay, Iraq is a cash really touching. Yeah, this is a good
Engin Terzi: put together a fight. Very interesting. That is the biggest match in that category. Yeah. It's very cool. Different styles. Oh my God. Yeah. 95 kilo. Okay. Two years ago, a little bit more than two years ago, two and a half years ago, Tata Kings beat Irakli. But then
Engin Terzi: Irakli went down 95 and won the world title. And he beat Rustam Babayev, he beat Sasho, and he beat Tautiev. And now two of them were world title matches. So if Irakli wins this one, he's winning the title third time, and he's going to have the belt permanently. And from other side, Tatashin really wants to have that belt as well. So who's winning here?
Fia Reisek: Irakli looked insane lately. Very dominant and I think that he will take it. But Todd has also looked insane. Yeah, he has been impressive. He impresses me all the time. But he struggles most of his matches in some way, right? But he still wins. He puts you in a position, unorthodox way of arm wrestling, and then he wins. Because you are not used to pulling that way while he is.
Engin Terzi: You ladies remember his match against Ongar Beya? Yeah, yes. It was a long, tough match, but he had the control, yeah. Yeah. But I do think Irakli will win anyway. He looks so dominant and he is just getting better and better. And, yeah, super strong. Yeah. And so, okay, let's go to...
Engin Terzi: Artur Morozov vs Vitalii Laletin. Also a really cool match, yeah. Left hand world title. Morozov won seven left arm supermatches. And he looked huge. He never lost left arm match. And he looked huge, like he gained some.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, he's 140 kilos. I think he's 10 kilos heavier than the time that he pulled against Kurdecha. Around 10 kilos right now, heavier. Yeah, I think he's taking it very seriously. I can see him. But his opponent is just when I say he never lost, I meant in the East versus West and King of the Table. And now he has an opponent that is...
Fia Reisek: Vitalii is top ranked in left arm? Yeah, Vitalii is top ranked. I think Vitalii is number two as far as I know. It will be really interesting but I think that Artur Morozov has huge motivation to take this match.
Engin Terzi: That's interesting. A lot of people think that Laletin is Haywell's favorite. Yeah, that you are one of them that now thinking, like you meant to say that you think Morozov will win? Yes, that's what I was saying. Yeah, that's how I felt. Yes, I was just clearing. And you ladies, Fia? I think Laletin will win. I also think Laletin will win. And Dominant Fashion?
Fia Reisek: huh dominant oh i don't know about that i don't think so i don't think it will be dominant um we will see it's hard okay okay so and michael todd versus hermes casparini
Fia Reisek: Yeah, that will be a great match. Todd has. We are saying that every match. Todd really seems super good mentally. I mean, what do you say? Mental strength right now. And he seems like he has improved the last matches I have seen. So...
Engin Terzi: I don't know and I don't know if I'm this is what because I'm hoping but I think Michael will take this you think Michael will win and yeah in Carolina what weight they're both heavyweight right yeah yeah they are super heavyweight yeah they are super heavyweight Michael is right now I think over 140 kilo I think or around 140 kilo while Ermes is
Fia Reisek: probably a little less than 130, but that is Ermes' usual weight. I think that it will be... Ermes is really explosive, but Michael can really hold him. You already said your opinion. How is he going to win? I think that Ermes will win. Me too. He's looking in good shape. He's explosive and...
Engin Terzi: Michael has his moves, but it won't be enough with Ermes. David you realize that Malin was trying to change your opinion? And Fia? No, Ermes will win this one. You what? Ermes will win. Oh, Ermes will win. Okay, so Karolina and Fia think that Ermes is winning and Malin is saying Michael Todd is winning. Yeah. Okay.
Fia Reisek: Todd will put up war. He probably has a lot of motivation after the previous match. And he is big faith and all of that. So he will come in with confidence. But I think Ermes will take it. I think they will tire him out. Ermes will hit, hit, hit, but he can't. Like he usually do. Yeah. And then Michael has too much endurance.
Engin Terzi: Okay. I was expecting you ladies to argue with each other, but so everyone is asking me. So I will move on. Yeah. Anyway, so I think it will be an incredible event. And then we will see. We will see how it will go. And in my opinion, we will witness something in Georgia that we have never ever witnessed anywhere else.
Engin Terzi: I think Georgian people are very hot blooded people, you know, they are very, and they will be supporting especially their countrymen like crazy. And I just can't wait, especially, um, Canada versus Devon match. I think, I mean, like,
Engin Terzi: Whenever they both are on the stage, I can't even think about arm wrestling. The match is more than arm wrestling. That's how I see it. I'm glad that I'm not pulling anybody from Georgia, being there in that atmosphere.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, were you ladies surprised that Devon is just like Devon continues his classic, I shouldn't say trash talk, but just like his way, you know what it is. And while he's going Georgia and pulling against the Georgian and he's still being so provoking.
Engin Terzi: yeah you do you lady like are you ladies surprised that like he's just no no no that's not surprised at all he enjoys yeah yeah he enjoys it no no no i'm sure he enjoys it but just yeah like like
Engin Terzi: Do you think he should be scared to go to Georgia? No, not scared, but he would be a little bit more careful or something. But he doesn't think like that. I have a question. When was your first competition? 2000? Our first competition against each other? No, international competition. 2000 or you?
Fia Reisek: I was in 1998. That was not the real WAF competition. David you go to 1999 Europeans in Belgium? I didn't. You did? Or Heidi did, I think. Yes, Heidi Andersson. I think 2000 was my first, both Europeans and Worlds. Yeah, probably mine too. Because there was some incidents with Georgians in 1999 Europeans in Belgium.
Engin Terzi: yeah after this podcast please don't forget ask neil what happened in 1999 europeans in belgium ask him what happened there and then and then he will tell you neil what happened no he said no no not after at the neil what what happened at the 1999 europeans in belgium all the fights
Engin Terzi: Oh, my God. I don't know. Let me take a seat. God damn it. No. You did it. You did it. You did it. Something unforgettable happened there, right? Yeah, I do. I do. Marlon doesn't want me to tell you all about that.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah. Hey, your hair is fucking good, dude. Of course, what do you think? No joke. For many years, I didn't brush my hair, I didn't shave, just because when people asked me, I told them they didn't believe. I said, I am saving my young years for the later age.
Neil Pickup: Look at him now. Listen, you might be 175 years old, you're only a couple of years younger than Marlon, but you don't look it. Before we go any further, tell them what you told me yesterday, that I look younger than 70. Tell them. Younger than 70 years old, yes. Paid me a compliment last night, Engin. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: They say that you look younger than 70, you don't show your age. 68, 69. I'm a half. Yeah, I was being nice. Yeah, I was being nice. Anyways, thank you very much. Thank you very much, Fia. Thank you very much, Malin. Thank you very much, Carolina. And you, ladies, take care of yourselves. Stay away from the injury.
Engin Terzi: yes and see you ladies in tbilisi yes see you thank you everyone bye
