Unknown: No, they found us.
Genadi Kvikvinia: He's saying Devon is praying right now. He's praying to God that he doesn't say anything mean to Devon right now. Why is that? It's because he's scared. So he prays that Genadi is not super mean to him right now.
Genadi Kvikvinia: So Genadi is scared? No, Devon is praying right now. So when he comes... I don't know. Devon didn't even check his Zoom link message. And it is exactly the time to start. So I don't know. He's not surprised. He's not surprised. Genadi is not surprised?
Devon Larratt: It's OK. OK. There we go. Stop opana. No. No. Do that Genadi you fucking see that shit?
Genadi Kvikvinia: He can't see what is written on the biceps. Show him again. Are you ready to lose Genadi? He's ready to win. Against who? Not me.
Genadi Kvikvinia: with those two fingers he's gonna he's gonna be with those two fingers why because everything else is injured and broken says you like your whole arm is very healthy right now yeah no no injuries oh yeah
Genadi Kvikvinia: I remember when you were younger, you would always fighting like this, you know, very close. And then as the age goes, you get open and open and open and more and more and more like this. And you're here. But one thing stays the same. Victory. Victory never changes. Styles change. Victory stays the same.
Genadi Kvikvinia: And when you stretch open this time, I'm going to drop you over the table just like the first time. What?
Genadi Kvikvinia: he knows he's gonna lose right like he's uh he doesn't have any doubts in his mind that i'm gonna beat him right you had the same dreams when you came to turkey and you remember what happened um
Genadi Kvikvinia: Hey, and, and just, just another thing. You definitely, definitely know that I'm the left-hand King of Georgia also, right? I'll match you on both arms if you want to. Yeah. Okay. No problem. No problem. The first, first.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Loki, say hello to your friend Genadi. Say hello to your friend Genadi, Loki. Maybe come and visit sometime. Come visit Loki sometime. When you come to Georgia, I have a present for you. I have a surprise. Where's the diapers that Levan gave you?
Genadi Kvikvinia: I think I thought that maybe Dennis picked them up. David Dennis grab those? You're supposed to leave it to you. Why did you give away the gift? Maybe Morozov took them.
Devon Larratt: I saw it was in your bag. In the morning, it was in your bag. No, no, no, no. I'm pretty sure that Dennis took those. Maybe Morozov. Those guys, I think they used the diapers. You should take them. When you come to Georgia, you will need them. So you're saying that you want to get beat left and right now? Yes.
Devon Larratt: You're going to lose on both. No, not even a possibility. We can, we can actually sprint a hundred meters and I'm still going to win. Nah, listen, listen, I'm not, I'm not really that much for running these days, but I am for beating you left hand and right hand. No problem. Oh, wow. I will be the King of Georgia, the King of Georgia on the 15th of February.
Genadi Kvikvinia: sakart velo sakart velo i'm gonna get a t-shirt with the sakart mellow king on it uh it's a saying uh it's like a uh it's like a praising in georgia people say so he's asking you to say say i will be the sakart velo king sakart velo say say sakart velo
Devon Larratt: what's it mean it's a saying uh when georgians say it like it's a praising for georgia hey i love georgia i love georgia i love georgia i've never been it's gonna be my first time i'm so excited
Devon Larratt: I'm so excited to come to Georgia. I think you guys have the very best athletes in the world. Not just in arm wrestling, but so many of the best athletes. It doesn't change the fact that I'm going to come in and kick your ass, Genadi. I'm coming. I'm going to fucking kick your ass in front of everybody. You better keep working. You better keep working. He's getting ready on lefty.
Devon Larratt: I'm tired. I'm tired of losing to Georgians. It's never going to happen again. When you say all those nice things about Georgians, I can't get mad at you anymore. Well, look, I do respect Georgia. I do respect Georgians. But make no mistake, Genadi, you are beneath me.
Devon Larratt: I am above you. I am your commander. I am your king. Make no mistake about it. On the 15th of February, you will bow to me in front of your people.
Genadi Kvikvinia: When you lose on 15th of February, you tell all your subscribers that they follow him every day for a month. I would tell everybody to follow you anyways. I would tell them all to follow you. Even if I completely destroy you, I'd say check this guy out.
Devon Larratt: He's one of the best in the world. I'm just way better, but you should follow his stuff. He's a pretty cool guy, but I make no mistake about it. I'm here. He's way down here. Oh, Oh, and starting to train again to what you want a piece of Samusha. I love what's going on. I didn't even say a single word since you came.
Engin Terzi: And I knew that I wouldn't be needed. And that's beautiful what you guys are doing. And thank you, Alex. Thank you for having me. Just let me know when you guys are done. Maybe I get involved and I'm not complaining at all. I love it. I love what's going on here. But Genadi, I don't see you aggressive enough, you know? No, because he knows. He knows, Engen. He knows last time he got lucky. We all know it.
Devon Larratt: We all know it. Last time he played his cards very well. There was a minor hiccup. He took advantage of it. Great fight. It will never happen again. He will not even ask for the rematch. He will not even ask for it. It will be that bad. He might not even want to arm wrestle me right hand. That's why I'm saying LeVon might have to come in for him. I'm going to beat him so badly that LeVon might have to come in.
Engin Terzi: There would be a, go translate, sorry about it.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I don't know why it didn't happen. I don't know why it didn't happen. I don't know why it didn't happen. I don't know why it didn't happen. I don't know why it didn't happen. I don't know why it didn't happen. I don't know why it didn't happen. I don't know why it didn't happen.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Genadi Kvikvinia: i beat you up so badly previous time and you were so tired you you were basically thrown up jody took you to your room plop you down on the bed and no make no mistake my wi-fi my wi-fi oh he's saying that the first time i beat you up so bad and you were so tired you were about to throw up and jody just took you plop you in a room to give you some rest and no make no mistake this time it's going to be the same he said not this time
Devon Larratt: not this time you're gonna get tired i'll tell you something i've learned a lot one second i have to move to a better part of my house i have to move to a better part of my house over here is better we hear you but you are frozen you're saying that i was uh i got tired last time you got tired it's gonna be the same now and i cannot lose in my home country don't forget it get ready
Engin Terzi: Let me get involved a little bit. Let me get involved. Genadi, can you imagine on that stage, Devon beating you and then just turning to the crowd and pointing Levan. And Levan is not competition shape. Of course, he's not going to come to stage. And imagine that Devon is doing that show in your country, front of thousands of Georgians on that stage.
Genadi Kvikvinia: and then going back to Canada. It would be terrible, right? And then Devon woke up as always being in a snowy Canada.
Devon Larratt: My wifi was cutting in and out there. I didn't, I didn't get everything that was said. Um, but this is Marimo. What were you like saying about the Devon's dream? Were you telling the story about Devon's dream right now? Me? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: No, no, I'm just, I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to let him realize if that, that, that result happens, that what kind of things he would, he would experience, you know? So he will probably declare himself the King of the Georgia on the stage. He will be saying this. And I think the Georgian people will like to hear that. No, they will love it. Georgians, so far as I understand.
Devon Larratt: If I know Georgians, Georgians love strength and they love power. No, Georgians are very patriotic people. They are very patriotic people. I'm the king of Georgia. I am the king of Georgia. What's not to love? What's not to love? I'll be their leader.
Devon Larratt: They will love me. The Georgians will love me. They love you as a Canadian, not as a Georgian king. No, no, no, no. I will come to Georgia. I will beat their general. I will stay. I will eat the food. I will become the king of Georgia in this victory. I wish you were there right now. I wish you were here.
Genadi Kvikvinia: so you'd lose right now you're not ready you're not ready you're not ready when i was when i was
Genadi Kvikvinia: When I was pulling Michael, you got so angry. You were trying to protect him, make him win at any cost. You were so angry. You basically, you almost took turns. You almost took turns against me. All I remember is you were crying and losing. You looked so weak and helpless.
Genadi Kvikvinia: got a little brave and uh after beating all the small guys you should not forget where are you coming it's super heavy you know it's too easy for me down there it's too easy and listen and i'll prove that i am the number two number two number two
Genadi Kvikvinia: Right now, you're probably like number 20. I'm getting an easy match. This is an easy match for me. You're maybe like number 20. He's not number 2, he's number 20. He's not in the same match as me. I think that's because he's got a lot of muscles. He's got a lot of muscle. He's got a lot of muscle. He's got a lot of muscle.
Genadi Kvikvinia: All your hopes are that his biceps bad and against Michael when I put it I put it a bit lower and it took time so it comes up a little bit it fixates and after Michael I start feeling it it feels better and you should be ready when you come to Jersey I'm gonna slap him
Devon Larratt: Michael beat you. I'm going to beat you. You can rematch Jerry. He'll beat you again. You can pull Dave Chafee. He'll beat you. We had lots of guys. No problem. No problem. Big losing streak. One, two, three, maybe four losses coming up for Genadi Kvikvinia.
Genadi Kvikvinia: That's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the kind of music you can listen to. You can listen to Jerry's music, you can listen to mine, you can listen to Michael's music, you can listen to Dave's music.
Genadi Kvikvinia: You're saying you fight some powers or something? I'm not sure what he's talking about. Fight some what?
Genadi Kvikvinia: oh he's saying that he's saying that you were fighting just about against some crows and he's a he's like a falcon like an eagle be more like a chicken or a turkey like a christmas turkey i think i think you look like a chicken i'm pretty sure you don't look in the mirror
Devon Larratt: Let me tell you, Genadi, I have a secret for you. A secret. I learned something very special. I don't drink water anymore. I only drink pop.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Only drink Coca-Cola or Dr. Pepper. No more water for me. When you come here, you're going to have diabetes and high sugar. I'll be the king of Georgia.
Genadi Kvikvinia: The King of Georgia, right here.
Engin Terzi: A few days before the event, I'll get a very good car. I get bored and I have a camera in front of me. Samusha. Just say that you want Samusha. I want, but I cannot. He's too strong. There's still space on the card, right? No, no. I probably better beat Alex only. Maybe if I go like this. Okay, what were you translating? Sorry, sorry.
Devon Larratt: So he was saying that he'll get a very fast and a fancy car a few days before the event. And when you come here, we're going to have a ride. Good, good. Maybe like a horse carriage, like like a carriage with horses. I think that that would be appropriate for me if I had a horse drawn carriage in Georgia.
Genadi Kvikvinia: And after the match, we'll hook you up. We'll hook you up and you can help pull the carriage.
Genadi Kvikvinia: He has five horses. All of them are like they're runners. So if you break something, don't complain. No problem.
Genadi Kvikvinia: no problem if there's a problem with one of the horses we'll bridle him up we'll tie him up and he can replace one of the horses why him why him yeah why
Devon Larratt: I'll warn my horse and when he's going to kick you in your nose, then you'll know. After I beat him, because this will be our second time, he will upgrade from dog to horse. He can be my horse. He can pull me around. He can pull me down around Tbilisi and perfect. And a little cart. I can have a little cart and we'll tie up Genadi. He can pull me around.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I'm going to be so strong, Genadi. So strong.
Genadi Kvikvinia: no chance canadi no chance i'm gonna destroy you destroy wow you you come here uh and after you come here then i'll explain what animal are you you're like a donkey a dragon i'll be a dragon
Genadi Kvikvinia: you're his donkey the dragon king of georgia he has the respect for jody but you better be careful oh it's gonna be
Genadi Kvikvinia: He's so much fun. I'm looking so forward to it. I'm looking so forward to it. Genadi, I'm sorry. Let me apologize now. Is it too early to apologize? It's like a firefighter belt. It's not going to rupture or turn apart. Not like his bicep?
Devon Larratt: Be careful. Be careful, Genadi. Devon't hurt yourself beforehand. Devon't train too hard. Come in healthy. Come in as healthy as you can. You're going to need every ounce of your strength. I would like to take it all from you. Every last drip.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I want every drift of your strength. You already made a mistake once. When are you going to learn? You're not going to win.
Engin Terzi: Once you already made a mistake. First time when you guys pull, I really had to stir the pot. Right now, I don't do anything. It's like all naturally. Two characters, strong characters are just going at each other. And just let me say a few things. Guys are asking for when the tickets will be available. Very soon. One second, Genadi. Soon we are going to announce the VIP and the tickets, you know, everything, you know, very soon.
Engin Terzi: And other than that, I would like to ask to Genadi. Genadi, what should we expect from the Georgian spectators towards Devon with all these comments that he's saying that he's going to be king of Georgia? Do you think that they will just take it?
Engin Terzi: As a joke, or they will be like, we love you, Devon, but... Joke? Why would it be a joke? What is the joke about it? I'm coming in to replace Genadi as their general. They will be so happy. General replacement Genadi is a different thing. Calling yourself as the king of Georgia is different. Who will beat me? Who will beat me? Who will beat me?
Devon Larratt: Hello, Devon? There is someone that has a memory problem here. Get Devon. Get Devon. You need him. Because Genadi's not going to be enough. He's not.
Genadi Kvikvinia: The idea is that if you want to do something, you have to think about what you want to do. Because if you want to do something, you have to know how to do it in Georgia. And if you don't know how to do it, you won't be able to do it. If you don't know how to do it, you won't be able to do it. And the idea is that you have to be a general in Georgia. You have to know how to do it. But the idea is that you have to know how to do it. And you have to know how to do it. And you have to know how to do it.
Genadi Kvikvinia: When you come here, you better kiss it right now.
Genadi Kvikvinia: You're going to be his servant when you come to Georgia. He said it first. You have to go first. You kissed my hand. He said first. Kiss him and he's going to lay easier on you, you know.
Devon Larratt: You wish I would kiss it. If you want to be a king, kiss the hand. I am the king of Georgia. Genadi, you will bow to me. You will bow to me. You will bow to me on the 15th. The night of the 15th will be the greatest day because you will finally have a king that is worthy.
Devon Larratt: You will finally be happy because I will come and lead you, Genadi. I will be your leader. Do you see this or not? See this, Genadi. You kiss.
Devon Larratt: my hand you will bow to me you will pull me around the city in a cart i will strap you up i will tie you up and you will march me to all the best places in in tbilisi you will feed me king khali you will give me that little green drink
Devon Larratt: oh last time you got angry this is a scar from a teeth from a tooth oh stop it there's no need there's no need to look at just because you won't be able to beat me just because you will not be able to beat me does not mean you have to get upset you should be so happy and so grateful for all the lessons
Devon Larratt: listen if you want to compare scars canadi i have many scars also i have many scars i could show you where i myself have been in some altercations but the only thing that i expect from you is a kiss on the wrist and to pull me around the streets of tbilisi afterwards you will be my horse you have graduated from dog
Devon Larratt: you are the horse of georgia you will be my lieutenant no longer a general no longer a general maybe captain maybe captain maybe even if you do very well no more general
Genadi Kvikvinia: Kiss the damn hand. I'm trying, I'm trying. Kiss my hand.
Devon Larratt: This is the hand that beat you last time. Forget about it. Forget about it. Stop living in the past, Genadi. Stop living in the past. I want to apologize to all of your followers, to all those who are loyal to you. I apologize. I promise to treat you all well. I promise. I promise to be kind. As a king, I will be a kind king.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I will be the kind king of Georgia. You have nothing to worry about. No? You have nothing to worry about.
Genadi Kvikvinia: So you're coming to defeat Georgia and like, how do I say it? Submitted? You are Georgia. You are the spirit of Georgia. And I'm coming for you. Yes, it's very true. You are the spirit of Georgia. And I'm coming for you. Yes, it's very true.
Genadi Kvikvinia: You'll never beat Georgians because our power is our soul and it's much bigger than people like you. You'll never defeat it. Just because you try to defeat the soul and you take this path, that's what you're going to lose. Make no mistake, Genadi.
Devon Larratt: You will be tested like you've never been tested before. I will take every last ounce of strength from you. Every last ounce. And in the end, you will be thankful for the lessons that I've given you.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Before you try to steal my power, you should take what I took first time. What I took first time, you should get that back.
Genadi Kvikvinia: You don't need more than that. I can gift you what I took the first time and I'm still going to win. He doesn't believe what he's saying right now.
Devon Larratt: i scared you so much you get you went down in 115 and you almost went to for samusha i will pull samusha before my career is done and make no mistake about it this will be victory for team west
Engin Terzi: You will lose in front of your people. You will lose. Devon, I have a question. Yesterday, Michael and Ermes, they were my guests, and Michael thinks that you are favorites and you can win.
Engin Terzi: but he thinks that you will be doing the same thing you did on the round one you did in Istanbul. And he sounded like he's afraid that, you know, you will be in trouble while trying to just make Genadi submit. Like, can you tell us about what is on your mind as a game plan? Complete domination. Oh, just, okay. Oh no, hang on.
Devon Larratt: Make no mistake about it. Before I'm finished with Genadi, he will bow to me. He will tell me that I'm the greatest. He will submit to me. I will make him quit in front of his people. Okay, before you secure the victory, you will make him quit. I will make him quit before I'm through with him.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Yes, I agree with what Mike said about Devon being a prophet, but the first thing that comes to mind is the fact that when you die, you are the one who dies. And that's a problem for Devon, but I think that if I die, he will die, and I think that I am the one who is the worst and the one who is the worst.
Devon Larratt: Tell him I apologize and I respect him, but this is the way it must be. This is the way that it must be. I do not care. The victory I already have. I already have the victory. I want everything.
Devon Larratt: i want everything you better start training ganadi you better start training because this is no joke i'm telling you what i'm going to do i'm telling you what i'm going to do and i'm going to do it so you better be ready don't be pretending like you're injured
Devon Larratt: after i beat you don't go saying that you got a sore bicep complaining or whining just tell everybody how great i am and don't ever ask me for a rematch ever again
Genadi Kvikvinia: Alex, tell what Genadi is saying, because he is following...
Genadi Kvikvinia: when i come to you i'm gonna you know in mortal kombat you they get a mouth they push in and they take the spine out they they murder people you know i'm gonna do this to you i'm gonna snatch your soul impossible impossible listen he can't even beat michael todd okay he lost badly to michael okay it's just gonna be worse michael's a nice guy michael's a good guy i'm not so nice
Genadi Kvikvinia: michael was nice to you he beat you he let you off the hook i'm not going to be so nice is
Genadi Kvikvinia: Michael is in a different form. He is in a different form. He is in a different form. He is in a different form. He is in a different form. He is in a different form. He is in a different form. He is in a different form.
Genadi Kvikvinia: all your hope is that michael isn't that strong and he's it's not in a good shape but he is he's very good and uh it looks like you forgot what happened in turkey when you when we pulled in the air you seem to forget what happened there you should probably go for a run or a walk
Devon Larratt: I don't want you to have a heart attack when the bright lights are on and the heat is on you and all your family and friends are watching. I don't want you to have a heart attack in front of your people. Do a little bit of cardio. Get rid of that fat stomach of yours a little bit so at least you look a certain way.
Genadi Kvikvinia: You're eating so much, your heart may stop right now. Enjoy your food, enjoy your food.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Genadi, I'm so excited to come to Georgia. I'm so excited. Your age right now is... Your age says that it's more of a probability for you than for me. Everything that I've said...
Devon Larratt: ah it's gonna come true everything i've said is gonna come true on that stage left arm right arm i will make you quit i'm gonna make you quit before we even pull right arm before your right arm even touches me you will have quit three times it's a it's new made for for wrist training
Genadi Kvikvinia: He's going to gift it to you when you come here. It's a real wood. Good wood. That's great. I appreciate it. As your king, I will accept all gifts and I will expect a certain amount of tax as well. You will need this when your stomach is going to have some issues.
Devon Larratt: I'm not worried about a single thing, not a single thing. I'm so excited for victory. I'm so excited to get revenge. I'm so excited to go into the strongest arm wrestling nation and declare myself King. I'm so excited about it.
Genadi Kvikvinia: You will not stop me. For me it's such a happiness to fight against you right now.
Devon Larratt: Alex, a little bit louder. They don't give me visa, so I can't come to you and fight you there. So I'm very happy that you're coming here. I'm so excited. I would rather fight you there. That's where I want to fight you. So I'm so happy also.
Engin Terzi: Alex, I have a question for Genadi. What does he think about Devon that he's coming to another country and he's just like brave enough to like declare that you know he's just gonna dominate and things like what does he think? Does he think it's a psychological game or is it courage or what is it?
Engin Terzi: What does he think about his strategy? How does he find Devon's strategy? Or is it all natural, he thinks? It's coming all from the heart or he thinks that Devon is playing mind games or what is it? What does he think? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Do you think there is a tactic in the game against Tama or is it just me? I don't know. Everything is possible in the game, but in the game it is possible that you will beat Levan. In the game it is possible. But when it comes to the real game, it is possible to beat David.
Genadi Kvikvinia: In his head, it's all true. In his head, he can win against Leo and against me. But when reality hits, he's going to be walking around like a sad puppy. Do you see me transforming into the super heavyweight champion of Georgia? Do you see it? Do you see what's happening?
Genadi Kvikvinia: You didn't say yet? Kiss me my hand. He said first, he said first, he said first.
Genadi Kvikvinia: One by one. One by one. One by one.
Genadi Kvikvinia: It's all true. When you come here, you're going to be welcomed. I'm going to show you the culture, the great food, the arm wrestling schools, but you will not win at the table. You lost. At the table, we don't even talk. Everybody knows. Everybody knows that I'm winning. Everybody. Just ask. Ask your mom. Ask your dad. Ask your girlfriend. Ask your friends.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Ask, who is the king of Georgia? Alex, translate. Who is the king of Georgia? Devon wants him to ask to even his father, his girlfriend, their father. . .
Genadi Kvikvinia: When there is one-on-one, there is no doubt about it, but there will be one-on-one, there will be two-on-one, and in the end you will not be able to win.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Right now, it's 1-0 for me and everyone knows that. That's the reality. If it becomes 1-1, then sure. But for now, it's 1-0, then it happens 2-0 and I will never pull you again.
Engin Terzi: I have a question, Alex. Devon, when we had a podcast in Neil's program, he was saying, like, Genadi is not a serious opponent. We need to find someone serious, even level. Yeah. This is 50 kilograms. This is 50 kilograms.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Rua, Rua, in 30 kilos, you lost a lot of weight. 50 kilos? 50 kilos? When we pulled the lefty in Turkey, Devon, I couldn't even do 15. Now it's at 50, and when I go to 70, I'm gonna rip away your wrist. Oh, 50 kilos! Rua, Rua, 30 kilos. In Turkey, if you lose weight, Devon Magida will give you a video. If you lose weight, you lose 5 kilos.
Engin Terzi: When we pulled in Turkey on Lefty, and everyone sees that the video is out, I couldn't even do 15. Right now it's 16. You were hilariously weak. Alex, just tell him to answer my question. Devon says that he doesn't take him seriously, right arm, and he's looking for someone like Levan, right arm. What does he think about this one?
Genadi Kvikvinia: Genadi, did Devon say that seriously? Like whenever he's talking about left arm, does it prove that Devon is right? He doesn't have hopes on his right arm or what? David Devon say that he was serious about his left arm? David he say that he was serious about his left arm? David he say that he was serious about his left arm? David he say that he was serious about his left arm?
Engin Terzi: I talk about lefty because I wanted the right anyway. Why do I even talk about it? Okay. He says the right is already over. He's going to win. Yeah. Now we talk about lefty because I wanted the right anyway. Okay. The question is, and another question is that a lot of people think that he's heavily underdog. Is he really as confident as he portrays himself with right arm? Just ask him. What does he think that he's winning chance, honestly?
Genadi Kvikvinia: It's 100%. And Devon, does Genadi believe in what he says? Of course not. Of course not. He's crazy.
Genadi Kvikvinia: He's crazy. If I'm crazy, then what are you? You're the sane one, huh? Me? Okay. I say, I say this.
Devon Larratt: I'd say for me to win, for me to win, it's actually 200% because I'll beat him right and left 100%. No chance. No chance. No chance. Lugo, Bekele, Irakli, Samusha, you.
Devon Larratt: This guy. One by one. One by one. I will not stop till I have each one of you. I will be the king of Georgia. I will retire in the mountains in a castle.
Genadi Kvikvinia: On lefty, it's 60-40 for me, but on righty, it's 100%. I understand how a guy coming off a loss is so confident. How can a guy be so sure of himself who just got smoked?
Genadi Kvikvinia: I think a good match for you is Corey West. It's a better match. Closer match. I think a good match for you is Corey West. It's a better match. Closer match.
Genadi Kvikvinia: David you mean Michael match? That when you say he lost? Yeah, it is what he means. He lost to Michael. A Michael student would beat him also. Even Corey West would beat Genadi. Dream about it.
Engin Terzi: Okay, a lot of people in the chat kind of think that this is a childish back and forth, which I disagree. And these people in the chat, they will realize the intensity on the stage on February 15th.
Engin Terzi: that I can't wait. Like there are a few matches that will be very intense. One of them will be Michael versus Ermes. But there are two other North American versus Georgian matches. Can be a little bit talk about them, you know, like, for example, Irakli Zirakashvili versus Todd Hutchings. What do you think, Genadi?
Genadi Kvikvinia: I think Irakli wins because right now he's on a completely new level. Comparing him to the first match, it's a completely different level and I think he's going to win. So he's thinking that there will be two Georgians for sure beating the North Americans. One he beats Devon and the other one Irakli beats Tata Chinks. And Devon, how do you see it?
Devon Larratt: I think Todd Hutchings is going to stop the match and bleed him out. Just the way it's going to be. Right in Georgia. It's going to be, unfortunately, like we all love the Georgians. We all think the Georgians are really cool. It just so happens that all the Georgians are going to lose. It's going to be a bad day for Georgia.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Every time you say something bad and wrong, you're going to kiss my hand. Kiss my hand. Yes.
Engin Terzi: I have news for you. Neither of you will kiss each other's hand. Devon is saying 2-0 for North America, and Genadi is saying 2-0 for Georgia. So let's go to the other one. It's actually 3-0, Engin, because he's going to lose left and right to me now.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Let's talk about... I'll use you like this. Remember when John said it as well? I'm going to use you like this. Every American and European that comes here, I'm going to use them like this to clean around. Devon, today I think I saw a video. You were talking about, Devon,
Engin Terzi: Like Europeans used to say that you are ducking them, and now you are saying that Europeans are ducking. Can I put you in a hard time or better not? Yeah, put me, look at it. Yeah, whatever you want to do, Engin. You want to give us some opportunities? Someone really wants to pull against you. Who? Who doesn't want to pull against you? Kamil. Kamil says he is not ducking you. You are ducking him.
Devon Larratt: Okay, what's Kamel want? He wants to pull what? Left arm. He wants another left arm match? He wants to beat me again? In Tbilisi, he wants to, yeah. Because he sent me a video. He said, Devon says that we Europeans are ducking. This guy, just so you know, he has autism. Okay? Do you know what autism is?
Devon Larratt: Do you know what autism is? I know, but I don't think he has. Yeah, he has it. Yeah. Camille has really bad autism. But what does that have to do with the subject? What's that? What does it have to do with his challenge to you? Well, it's just that he should be medicated. Like he, he should be taking his pills more often. And, but it means that he shouldn't pull against you. Are you offering me a match?
Devon Larratt: I mean, if you guys are okay, I would. Then I'm okay. You offer me a left-handed match, I'll take it. In Tbilisi against Kamil. 100%. You give me a left-handed match, I'll take it. I'll beat that autistic kid. He pulled me when I was not training whatsoever. That fucking retard wants to fucking arm wrestle me so bad, I'll give it to him.
Devon Larratt: I'll give it to him, whatever. I knew that you always had a plan for him. It just wasn't right time, but with this such provocation. The thing is, I'm going to Georgia. I wanted Georgians. I hear him all the time. The guy needs to be medicated, seriously. He's mentally deranged. I think he probably has an IQ of about 65.
Engin Terzi: But I'll pull him. I was thinking we were going to do it in Poland. I was saving up to get him in Poland. But if nobody in Georgia will face me, look, I don't want to do two left-handed matches. I have a question for you. Where would you put these two matches if really we set this match? Look at the chat is just now, it's just like having an earthquake.
Engin Terzi: They have us. What's the matter to me? Doesn't matter to me, but then used to be like, well, it doesn't matter to me. I'll do them back to back. No, no, no, no, no. I don't care where you put them. I don't care where you put them. Why do you know?
Devon Larratt: My main effort, my main effort is Genadi. This is the main effort. You want him first? I'm coming to Georgia for the Georgians. I'm coming for the Georgians. Okay. Kamil, Kamil. Okay, then you versus Kamil, maybe another event. I'll beat Kamil in Poland.
Devon Larratt: I'll be the king of Poland too, if he's a king. I don't know who's better, him or Kurdecha. I'll pull both of them when I go to Poland. I'll pull Kurdecha right, and I'll pull Kamil left. I'm not sure if we have an event in Poland, but we will take you there. The two best Polish guys, Kamil and Kurdecha. And I heard that they don't like each other very much. You want to pull Kurdecha right and Kamil left?
Devon Larratt: In Poland. Right in Poland. We may not have the event in Poland, so we don't know that. Yeah, and that's the thing. When we're traveling around the world, I like to beat people in front of their families. That does something special for me. That guy is really mean. When I can beat you in front of your wife and your kids and your family and your workers and all the people who sing the same national anthem as you, that does something special for me. That's why I want Georgians.
Genadi Kvikvinia: It does something special for me when I beat you in your own country. Camel is going to follow me around wherever I go. Here, calm yourself down a little bit. He actually suggested that you should change your last name to Laratyshvili. I'll do that.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I think I should, as the king of Georgia. I will now be known as Lerat Ishvili. While I'm in Georgia, you can call me that. Lerat Ishvili.
Genadi Kvikvinia: you can he will give you a last name and then you can choose like maybe uh he's excited he's gonna give you the last name
Genadi Kvikvinia: Kiss his hand and he's gonna give you the last name. He'll give you the last name. King Larateshvili demands a kiss. King Larateshvili demands you kiss. It's like a Georgian map. If you kiss it, he'll give you the last name. You'll become Larateshvili. I will allow him to call me that when he kisses my wrist.
Genadi Kvikvinia: That's his king. That's his king. I'll forgive you a lot of things just if you kiss my hand. No need. No need.
Genadi Kvikvinia: no need for forgiveness i will i will forgive all likewise as his king i will also become his teacher in many ways he can learn from me
Genadi Kvikvinia: right now no if you're ashamed i'll call you one and one and then you can kiss my hand yeah that's that's interesting let's let's talk about
Devon Larratt: a bit about other matches. What do you guys think about Michael versus Ermes? Michael. Good match. Good match. Very good match. Close match. Michael. Tough match. Very close. Probably go the full five rounds. So you are saying 3-2, Michael? Yeah. Close match. Very hard fought.
Devon Larratt: Wow. I can't wait. I'm just imagining the long... Very hard fought. Very hard to finish. Ermes might be able to do it a couple times. Not three. Not three. Can I ask you a question? If Ermes somehow takes Michael's... Will it still be hard? Or only if they are in equal position with the wrist? If it's equal position, Michael will win easy.
Devon Larratt: Ermias will have central control, most likely. Ermias most likely will be dominant at the beginning. But he needs to be able to finish the match relatively quickly. And that'll be very difficult to do. Very difficult. Michael is strong. I believe Michael will win in a long, hard-fought battle. Then you are saying that the next battle of Levan, we will see Michael versus Levan?
Engin Terzi: Or Vitalii, whichever way you're doing it. I don't know how that's all going. Michael says that he's ready to pull next match. He should wait. It's totally up to him, you know, and then you guys can talk and decide. And how do you see this, Genadi? I don't know.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I think it's going to be a great...
Genadi Kvikvinia: It's going to be a great, they're going to kill each other. Just a crazy match. And I was in a good shape against Michael. I didn't think he could beat me, but it happened. And I think he grew after my match to Ermes as well. So they're going to kill each other in any way. It's going to be like a bloodbath. Wow. Good match. Yeah. Devon.
Engin Terzi: Like, what do you think about Brett Grundy, Bacho? Bacho lost against Reno, but we saw how good Reno is by winning the world title. And we saw that it was a very hard match in the early rounds for Reno. And we saw that Reno has the worst possible technique against Bacho to just arm. I think Bacho is more like...
Engin Terzi: stronger in the hand and wrist, while we saw how Brett Grundy beat Paulo and how he beat Matt Mass. Both were surprising. The guy doesn't look like any intimidating, you know, just like guy, but he's just super hand control. A lot of people think that Bacho is stronger. How do you see this match from your perspective? Good match. What's the weight?
Devon Larratt: 105. But Brad said that he's like 245 or something. He said that he knows how to do the water cut. Yeah, he's good at it. I think Brad's definitely in this. I think Brad can pull it off. Young Saginashvili is really good. I don't know exactly where he is. I don't know exactly where he is.
Devon Larratt: I think that a lot of people will have Brad as the underdog, but I, I, I I've seen Brad do incredible things. Really? Like I remember when did you expect him to be mapped like that? No, no. I did it, but he, he really, he's very good. He's a very, very talented arm wrestler. And, um, I think he's going to come in in good shape and yeah, that's an interesting match.
Devon Larratt: Obviously, I'm going to go with Brad Grundy. I think it's a very close match. I think that it's really essential that Brad Grundy gets hand control. I think going into a hook is a mistake. You know, even any kind of idea of hooking is a mistake. I think he's got to try and, you know, keep that. But that's the way Brad pulls, so it's really good. Yeah, that's how he pulls, yeah.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Yeah, so good match, good match, good test. Yeah. Genadi, how do you see that? Bacho, Brett Grundy? Brett Grundy and Bacho. How was the match? How did you like it? I think it's going to be a good match. The two of them are going to be on the same team. I think it's going to be a good match. The two of them are going to be on the same team. I think it's going to be a good match.
Genadi Kvikvinia: he thinks it's going to be a great match they're both very young very good they they know each other he had a great fight with reno too
Genadi Kvikvinia: They're both young and they're going to fight very good. And I see them as athletes that are going to continue. He obviously roots for Bacho and he thinks Bacho is going to win. They're both athletes that are going to continue until their late age. And they're going to stick with armwrestling and go as they age and still armwrestle. But they're both very young and it's incredible. Yeah. Devon, I have one for you.
Devon Larratt: Oleg Petrenko versus Betkili Onianii, 95 kilo world title. David you like the match? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What a tough match. Tough match. I mean, hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold on. Who did you say? Oleg Petrenko, Betkili Onianii. Right, right, right, right. Right.
Devon Larratt: For some reason, I was thinking something else. I have to think that Betkili is the favorite. I have to think that. Is it because of weight loss to 95? If it was 105, it would be different? I think that, in all honesty, I think that Petrenko should be pulling 95. I think that that's a better class for him.
Engin Terzi: I think that he's better suited for that category. You know, the 95 kilo is, yeah, it's just a better fit. David you mention his battle against Alejandro Murado, left arm? Yeah. David you know that before the pandemic, at the last Rotator, he also beat David Dadikyan with left arm at 95 kilo. So his left arm is also very strong, yeah. Yeah, so it's just, for me, I think Beck Kelly,
Devon Larratt: I mean, I've just watched BetKili do some really incredible things. I mean, yes, Oleg's definitely a great challenge. I have it probably 55-45. I mean, yeah, great match. You'll give 55% to BetKili? I think so. I think so. I'm very surprised.
Devon Larratt: But in his struggle against Oleg Zhokh, were you waiting more dominant performance or how you expected before the match? That's the thing. I mean, look, it's just really hard to deal with his hand, right? Oleg's hand, yeah. It's just really, really difficult. So, I mean, I don't know that Betkili was, you know, it was definitely a very, very tough match. But, yeah, he's just such a problem with his hand and wrist.
Engin Terzi: It's hard, you know. It wasn't about the strength, but the application of the strength because of the hand size. Really difficult to deal with his hand, right? Yeah. So 55% Betkili, 45%? I think so. I think so. And you can... Yeah, very good. Betkili is already. Samut Fior Mutri.
Devon Larratt: 60-40 for Betkele. 60-40. And another question now, Devon. What do you think about Prokopchik? I think he's going to have the same issue. You know, it's very hard to deal with that hand, you know. Prokopchik is so strong. I love watching him arm wrestle. His strength is just ridiculous.
Devon Larratt: But I can't help but think his hand and wrist are going to be really badly compromised. Yeah, but do you know that he can also pull that weight? I know, it's just, you know, nobody, it's just, it's difficult. That's a difficult place. He's not tall enough to have a long reach. It's difficult to do that, you know, over and over and over when it's not really your main move. I don't think that that's Daniel's main move. He can do it.
Engin Terzi: But I don't think he's like, I'm going to come in there, that's going to be my move. I don't think he does that. I think he prefers to get his hand. Yeah, he used to be like almost main. I took his wrist, Mindaugas took his wrist, and he was still pulling that way. But lately, he better his hand and wrist. And I think that might be the reason that he lost to Mindaugas once he lost his wrist, because he gets so much used to hand control. And then once you lose it after a long time, your endurance and
Engin Terzi: memory is not there anymore you know like but yeah i understand you yeah yeah i wouldn't be surprised i wouldn't be surprised if he causes serious problems uh do you know that like he's orthopedic doctor you know and surgeon very impressive yes his training is very interesting
Engin Terzi: Yes, he is one of those guys that understands the sport. There are not many, but he understands. He still has some way to go because he is still very young. But when you look at his age, you see that he knows what he is doing. And that's very impressive of him. And Genadi? Prokopchik and Oleg Zhokh, right? Yeah. 85 years old. Prokopchik and Oleg Zhokh, right? 85 years old.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I think Oleg is going to win. Daniel is a strong guy. He's very good, but I would favor Oleg and I think he's going to win.
Engin Terzi: okay let's let's go to some pia versus mali not everyone can be champion yeah you know you know that you know that she didn't mean that right you know right oh she's so funny she didn't mean that you are not good enough to become champion but she probably meant that when two guys are pulling
Engin Terzi: Both of them cannot stay at the same time. Fia is very funny. I very much appreciated that comment. That was after Genadi, she said that. Yes, yes. But she didn't mean that you are not good enough to be champion. It sounds that way. Not everyone can be champion. Devon't worry, Devon. I say that all the time when I talk to Fia now. Every time I see Fia, I think I tell her that. It sounds like disrespect, but she means one of them has to lose. That's what she meant.
Devon Larratt: I didn't care. I thought it was very funny. I really thought it was great. I think it's a close match. I think that they've known each other a long time. They've pulled with each other. They're like best buddies. What a great match. I hate to pick either one of them, truthfully. I really do. Really, I think it's a very, very close match. I have to kind of lean towards Malin just because she won the last one
Devon Larratt: Do you know that she's going down to 70 kilos for this match? Yeah, yeah. I just think that if there's an advantage that Malin has, it's her speed. Yes. Yeah. And if she can make the match very quick, and the thing is they know each other so well, I think. Yeah.
Devon Larratt: I think the stopped match favors Fia and the goal favors Mallon. So, and I think it's been a long time really for, for Mallon. I look, I feel like Fia has been at competing more often, you know, and I think that Mallon probably has something to prove.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, it will be very, very interesting. And I thought that Fia would be like unbeatable under 70 kilo. But now Malin is coming down with her experience, explosiveness, and she knows Fia very well. Fia also knows her very well, so we will see. I have another question for Genadi.
Engin Terzi: David Dadikyan versus Alex Kurdecha left arm. A lot of people think that like, oh, David is just lighter or something. David was 114 kilo when he beat Artem Morozov three rounds in a row and then lost four rounds. And in this match, he needs to win three rounds and he is over 120 kilo right now. And how does Genadi see this match? But when we know that left arm is Alex Kurdecha's
Genadi Kvikvinia: What do you think about the fight between Dikian and Alex Kurdecha? Because many people think that this is not a real fight. But Morozov lost 3 rounds in 3 rounds. He was 10-14 kg. But he didn't lose weight. Now he has 3 fights and he lost weight to 10-14 kg. What do you think about this fight? Because Kurdecha is not a real fighter.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I think if David is healthy and he's left...
Genadi Kvikvinia: I think it's Dadikyan if he's as healthy and as solid as he was before because he had some issues as I know before on lefty and of course Kurdecha is a great guy as well like he's very strong and it's just my opinion that I think Dadikyan should win in my opinion if he's healthy
Engin Terzi: That's interesting because a lot of people think David is light heavyweight and then since Alex Kordeshi is around 160 kilos. And how do you see this, David? I think Alex. I think Alex is... I think the frame size is going to be a big issue. I think he's just going to top roll him. I think, quite honestly, I think that
Devon Larratt: David should probably be pulling 95 kilo if he wants to really go after a world title. I think, I think that's probably the best place for him. Um, you know, I know he's great. Like I know he's awesome and I know he has the ability to pull with anybody, but I think for him to win a world title, it'll probably be at 95. Um, The open way. I think that Alex is going to be too big. I think he's going to top roll them. I think the hand, the arm length, I think it'll be too much.
Engin Terzi: That's how crazy the level is. We talk about David Dadikyan and you are thinking that means to pull 95 kilos. It's not to disrespect him, it just shows how hard it is to win the title right now. Yeah, it's not easy. Where do you pull? Do you pull 115? Do you pull 105? The thing is he probably could make 95. I remember
Devon Larratt: years ago when the top eight was was going on he was you know set to pull the 95 top eight and i i thought that he was one of the favorites to win that and i still think that he was probably very young even when he was pulling youth category edward he was pulling 100 kilo okay okay listen i i i don't know him really close right now when i offer him a match he was 270 pounds you know
Engin Terzi: And he's just, I didn't know he was that heavy. I mean, he's cutting weight all the time for the day. I'm like, he's always coming down from two 60, under the 18 kilo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's really big guy. And I can't, I can't imagine how big he will be when he's pulling super weight now. Okay. Well, look at, I think it's great. I mean, if, if, if that's, if that's something he can do, then that's amazing.
Engin Terzi: It's not going to be easy with Alex Kurdecha. That's not going to be easy. Okay, yeah. And then, Golemanov versus Vasily Dautashvili. Let's see what Genadi says. Genadi is familiar with Golemanov because of the WAAF years. I'm sure you know Golemanov as well. In my book, one of the best top rollers ever in the history.
Genadi Kvikvinia: There is one thing that I would like to ask you. Do you think that you will be able to compete with Vasu? How do you think? I don't think that I will be able to compete with him. But I am sure that I will be able to compete with him. I am sure that I will be able to compete with him. I am sure that I will be able to compete with him. I am sure that I will be able to compete with him.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Lately I haven't been like following Stoyan as much.
Genadi Kvikvinia: It's very tough to be very brave about saying...
Genadi Kvikvinia: for Stoyan because Stoyan has more accomplishments than Vasso in my opinion but if Vasso comes in a best shape and he comes very good at February 15th I think he has more chances to win and I favor him I think he more he has more chances but of course it's very hard to bravely say that he's gonna just run over Stoyan you know he's a great guy as well and and after that I think Vasso can go against other names in East versus West as well
Engin Terzi: Devon, did you know that Vasily Dautashvili has wins against Genadi and Levan? Wow, that's... When they were 100 kilo. That's awesome. That's awesome. Yeah, I mean, I know who he is. He beats John as well. He has a win against John as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Yeah, hey, it's not this. Careful, so the fossil doesn't meet you at 100 kilograms as well. OK. Maybe I should be pulling him instead of Genadi. It's been awhile kisses that again.
Genadi Kvikvinia: You're sitting just without a job. I can't imagine they are meeting in Tbilisi. They both go like this. Like at least 200 people is going to be in the airport just waiting for like this.
Genadi Kvikvinia: i'll be a man i come when i meet you the first thing i'm going to do is like this this i like this match a lot because a couple reasons for one i think it's just a great match but i like
Devon Larratt: that there's more people in 150 in that yes and i think a lot of people should be a lot of the guys who are like at that 260 270 to it like these guys should be in the 115 to make it more competitive devin do you know that you are you are the the like you are the how to say you are the one that
Engin Terzi: who is murdering excitement in those categories, right? You just come there, visit, and then you go up to eat super heavy weight. You're making those categories look bad. You know that, right? I'm not saying it's bad. Get me a good opponent. I'll go down there any time.
Engin Terzi: that's where i should be i understand i understand but right now right now it's just like to me one of five was the most exciting category still very exciting but not most exciting anymore after after what petrenko did to others and what we did to petrenko you just came and you killed all the fun and you just left you know i'll be back i'll be back just find me another ch find me another champion find me another champion i'll be back anytime
Engin Terzi: You are too much for that category. Easy to say, yeah. Let's see. Maybe you versus Alizhan left arm. Yeah. I like it. In Kazakhstan. In Kazakhstan. Yes. Kazakhs are even more serious than Georgians. There. No problem. No problem. No problem. Okay. To Alizhan, I'd be respectful. I just want the match with the champ. He's the champion.
Engin Terzi: I would love the match. Love it. Okay. But, Devon, I have a question for you. You would wish, right? Just tell me honestly, you know, just no political answer and nothing, you know. Like, you would wish, right, if I was, like, as big as you in size? You would, right? You would, right? Listen. Listen. Listen. Listen.
Engin Terzi: you know you would wish to beat me right you would wish to we've had our back and forth yeah we've had our back and forth yeah i don't know if you could handle it brother no no if i was big enough i know i know what you mean i know what you mean yeah i would just go to the cave cut my connection with the technology nothing except like somehow maybe i would send letters to my family
Devon Larratt: until the day that we're gonna come and yeah i i know i know i couldn't you might still live a long time what do you mean you might still be on this earth for some time and yeah me too and and i might get skinnier oh 95 kilo no problem yeah today today today i saw a photo for you for you engen for you
Engin Terzi: For you, I would walk many miles. I know, I know, I know. That's what I am saying. I'm one of your... Get healthy, Engin. Get healthy. Yeah, okay. Get healthy. Get healthy. Okay, I just cannot back... You're secretly training. I just can't back... I only did two trainings in one month, you know. Devon't get too excited, Engin. I train every day.
Engin Terzi: No, I'm just saying I have been ill. I have been ill. So whatever. Anyways, I'm not going to say anything I cannot back. So, yeah, you're great. Yeah. Anyways, so who's winning? Sergei Kalinichenko or Frank Lamparelli? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Good match. Good match. He's going to have problems with his hand maybe. Frank Lamparelli is good hand.
Devon Larratt: I really don't know. I lean towards Sergei because I just think he's a bit crazier and a bit more serious. I think he's more professional. But that's a good hand he's going up against. A very good hand. But did you know that right now he's in very interesting shape? Yeah, I've heard. Lamparelli I'm talking about.

Genadi Kvikvinia: You said the best thing again, so. Can you tell Genadi to get up and turn his back? I want to look at his shoulders. Everything looks bigger. How can somebody be small and fat at the same time?

Engin Terzi: Yeah, we will see. It will be incredible. I just can't wait. You know, I just sometimes hate to be like organizer. I just want to go there as a fan and just enjoy, you know, you guys are without having any stress or responsibility about the organization. I can't wait. Like I would really just from my side, I'm saying I would pay $500 just to watch this match. Anyways, yes.
Engin Terzi: It's going to be a total destruction, Engin. Devon, do you believe that? Devon, Devon, look at it. This guy is getting bigger. And this guy is very confident. I don't think he's better. I saw him in real one week ago. Just ask, Alex. You were there when we were going to the restaurant. He was walking in front of us. You pointed out his back. From his hoodie, you could see the muscles, right? And then you see how much...
Devon Larratt: yeah yeah trust me devon you better be careful i'm not saying he will beat you or you will beat him but don't underestimate him it's gonna be the easiest match of my life easy easy match it's gonna be like leonidas or chance easy matches

Genadi Kvikvinia: That's me. I'm going to rip it on your head. Me?
Engin Terzi: That's great. I love it. I thought that when you first called him dog, I thought he would be so angry. But it's good that you guys are both in good spirit and going back and forth. I love it. But I'm sure that at this stage, the intensity will be mind-blowing. Today, I take my blood pressure medicine before this one. And there, I think I will take double because of the pressure. Thank you, Devon. Thank you, Genadi. And thank you, Alex, one more time. Kiss me my hand.
Devon Larratt: Bye, love.
