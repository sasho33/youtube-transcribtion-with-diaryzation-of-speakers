Engin Terzi: I just wanted to do some, we are live right now, and yeah, I just wanted to do some podcast to support King of the Table. So how is everything going? Going good, yeah. Feeling any less pain or? I wish I could tell you.
John Brzenk: Yes, but then I know that's not the case. I haven't been doing as much training, trying to just let it relax, but it doesn't seem to be getting any better. So it is what it is. I told you before, I was actually thinking about scheduling orthopedic surgeon to look at it again, the shoulder and my lower back. My lower back is still kind of
John Brzenk: stiff ever since what i went and got back surgery probably 15 um 15 20 years ago and they uh fixed the l5 i believe the l4 and l5 were kind of messed up so anyway yeah it just sucks getting older but are you holding the phone in your hand yeah well you you will be tired you said this was just gonna be for 10 minutes right i said that
John Brzenk: you know, I need to find a stand. Oh, God. Just just put on a table. No, you don't have to. But I'm worried about you that you will be tired. Well, I'm in my easy lazy boy chair. So now this is probably better. Okay, so you will do right and left. Yeah. I can hold for you. It's easy. Yeah, I was just worried about the stabilization. Like it's kind of probably not as stable. Like, people will be like, looking all over.
Engin Terzi: yeah so what's that what's new with you like yeah here we got uh you know robert baxter is part of the league and um yeah yeah that going he's got i mean john like i i i did whatever i can with my capacity but but you saw that you saw that um you saw that okay there is one super chat john is the greatest there is no other todd and oleg's love child says um
Engin Terzi: You know, you know that like in Orlando event, you saw the fire and like I saw that the like like I mean, North American fans have been supporting my event for a long time and they never had a chance to go in person, but they kept. And then whenever we did the event in Orlando, you also witnessed it like they really
Engin Terzi: show that they deserve the event to be held there like i never seen something i watched on pay-per-view i i didn't go there but you saw in person so do you agree that like they deserve much more than like once in a while yeah yeah if you can build on that if we can continue to hold events like that and it gets bigger and bigger i mean the the energy i mean obviously it's not 90 000 you know
John Brzenk: person's stadium watching NFL, but for the little cramped area that that was in and no air conditioning, it was quite the experience for sure. Yeah. We didn't know what to expect. Like, I can guarantee you that there has never been an event with like in person tickets, like buying for an arm wrestling event. Right, right, right. Yeah. The fans. Yeah. Typically an arm wrestling event like that, you know, they bring their friends and family and it's pretty low key, but yeah, that, that definitely has some high energy.
John Brzenk: yeah but it was well produced yeah i mean the you know the the lighting and the backdrop and everything was was done you know really well i don't know um if it was the shaw's who were mainly involved with that but um of course i think he did have don and four sports but yeah no it was just put together really well yeah yeah i i hired those people to you know yeah provide the service here anyways um so what i believe is that
Engin Terzi: At that event, I think there was like near 800 in-person ticket sale, but the tickets were sold out eight days before the event. I just could make 50 more tickets. I made premium tickets. And then it was also sold out very soon, like quickly. So what I just say, and if you realize that in that card, there was not really like world title level match. There was good matches, very good matches.
Engin Terzi: so i i see that i see that with a good car there will be a thousand five hundred people two thousand people and we can build it we need we need to rotate right now we have plans to organize one in switzerland like we plan to do friday the service open swiss open is probably the biggest one of the biggest uh tournament in the world and then next day next day the east versus west and then i think king of the table
Engin Terzi: poland is possible georgia wants to organize there is some mid-east country and so and then in u.s i'm just thinking that or north america like if like this was in orlando and then the next is atlantic city just go just say texas go las vegas then chicago then go toronto so
Engin Terzi: there are some people just say two three hundred people will travel everywhere they are hardcore arm wrestling fans but we need local people or nearby you know like near area people to go and watch in person like you cannot you can go to an event but if it is far away and same place all the time you cannot tell your friends hey i'm gonna take you to our messing event but but if it is nearby you can just say i'm gonna buy let's go today to our message right but we need to grow
John Brzenk: grow, and then I can see that in the soon future, a few thousand people in person will go, then that's how we are going to build it. Yeah, yeah. And you know, that in itself brings more excitement. I mean, people draw people. I mean, when you can double it and double it and double it, and pretty soon there's 4, 8, 10, 12,000 people, then it's an event. Mainstream sports. Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah.
John Brzenk: Yeah, but you saw it in person that, you know, the atmosphere in Orlando, there hasn't been anywhere else. And maybe Devon versus Levan match in Istanbul, there was also really... Different experience. That, you know, that setting, that venue in Turkey is very nice. Beautiful, beautiful stage, beautiful, you know, seating, very comfortable. But it just wasn't the grittiness that
Engin Terzi: Orlando had I mean spectators, you know, American people knows how to entertain Themselves, you know, they get fired up, you know and over here people are more quieter They watch it like but but they don't I realize this even when I used to live in us in the events You know, they were always you know, they like to get a little more passionate. Yeah, I
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and but that that is i think what makes us like uh the the capital of the show businesses i should say or entertainment businesses and that is that is why that i think that from now we should just like uh rotate you know europe just one in asia maybe like like depends you know what the offer is but but i think that at least half of the events needs to be
Engin Terzi: north america and um i don't think that like i just tell me like ask me you know just saying just find someone who is better than robert baxter and i that person is gonna do the deal i cannot think anyone because the guy loves arm wrestling you know yes no no he's been involved for 30 plus years so yeah he's he definitely he's been through the sport enough to know the ins and outs and and
John Brzenk: history of it for sure so yeah he's not the biggest fan of yours well he grew up in my basement for the first probably 15 20 years you know he was uh you guys trained together oh yeah of course yeah no he just uh literally maybe 10 houses away from me i mean we live right next to each other uh-huh oh yeah you were yeah neighbors as well yeah yeah just across the street across the way
John Brzenk: Who moved there first, you or him? He was living there first, I believe. Yeah. Yeah. Just weird coincidence that we moved from our apartment to the house that we live in. Lived in Brisbane. And yeah, then I met him and his brother and realized that they just live right across the street. Can you tell me why you moved to where you live now? Just just curious. Is it because of business or is it because of
John Brzenk: want to be close to your relatives or what to you're saying to arizona or yeah yeah when i first moved to utah no no no to arizona arizona i just spent 30 plus years in utah and i just thought it was time for a change uh my two girls uh were basically out of the house uh finished high school uh my oldest almost finishing college and my youngest was going to college so um we just i don't know
John Brzenk: I thought it would be nice for a change. You wanted to choose somewhere warmer? Warmer. Rene's brother lived down here at the time. And some family, my brother lived down here. So I just thought it would be a nice change to try somewhere new. And it's been good. I like Arizona.
John Brzenk: i mean we still go up to utah all the time but yeah utah utah that corridor is so crowded um you know the mountains are beautiful of course but um off the mountains there that the traffic and uh the busyness of salt lake uh to be quite honest i mean phoenix has a lot more population than uh than salt lake uh og and provo but it it feels it feels like i live in the country out here i mean i'm i'm just 20 minutes from the airport and i just it's just
Engin Terzi: super quiet traffic's not bad i mean it's um so it's been it's been a good change we've enjoyed it logan missy says john we fans acknowledge you as the god always oh i appreciate that yeah well i'm curious i'm curious if if how much do you care about these things
John Brzenk: Um, not at all. I mean, I, I've, I've learned to just accept it and just kind of nod and say, and smile and say, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. But, um, I'm not saying it's changed so much. Yeah. I, um, obviously, obviously I wish I was involved in the sport now.
John Brzenk: um when you were in prime 20 years old 30 years yeah yeah yeah yeah you know 30 40 years ago when uh it was just just it was different um you know it was people still had the passion for it but um it just wasn't as well nearly as well known as it is now and the competition wasn't as deep and as fierce as it is so but um yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but but still like there is no one's victory
John Brzenk: uh at the arm wrestling table makes the community as happy as when you win you saw that in orlando yeah no well that was it was definitely it was exciting for me too because i knew it was going to be a hard-fought match and um yeah to squeak by like that is uh exciting and rewarding um yeah winning easily is you know it's
Engin Terzi: it's not nearly as great a feeling as just just giving it after a war especially when you recover from here that'll definitely be a memorable memorable match for me yeah i remember you versus taras that this similar position yeah you didn't the shoulder pressure you beat him like this sideways yeah yeah the other day i watched over the top again i i saw you
Engin Terzi: okay yeah yeah yeah it was 1986 so yeah shoot that's coming up on what 40 years now holy holy cow cow yeah yeah it's unbelievable i i remember i remember after i watched it in a movie theater we had a flower shop i just run there turn the light on i at the side we had a depot
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I started training, you know, it was like after midnight, after midnight. Yeah. Yeah. Um, like that can get you motivated. Uh, the catabolic T-Rex, John, in your unbiased opinion, who would win left-handed super match between Murado and Morozov? Like Alijan Murado? Alijan Murado and Artem Morozov he's asking. Yeah. Yeah.
John Brzenk: alan yeah is it his first name alan alizan alazan alazan um i think alizan he's he he has shown i don't think he's shown his full potential yet he's he he goes into matches and makes matches tougher for himself because he's he's showboating a little bit uh a little bit and and rightly so i mean he can and still win but uh i think if he really
John Brzenk: gets tested and gets serious he's he's he's the best i think he's the best lefty yeah what do you think your opinion what do you what do you think i'm the organizer i shouldn't yeah yeah yeah no morozov is good if he stops it i'm obviously i think um but yeah no um alazan is uh i think he's he's he's got even more than he's showing right now
John Brzenk: Yeah, but I think Laletin would be a difficult match for him. We don't know. I don't know. Can he hook him? He might shut down that top roll really easily, and if he does, he'll get, you know, Bataleo gets flashed. By the way, can you beat Brian Shaw? I have no idea. I need to talk to, like...
John Brzenk: I should have went up there. I got asked to go up to the train with them with Brandon Allen about a month or so ago. And I can't remember. I had something planned or something going on. Is it far from you? Five and a half hours. Yeah. You mean the driving or driving? Yeah. In some ways, I'm kind of glad I didn't go up there because if he would have just killed me, then I would say, oh, I'll stay away from the guy.
John Brzenk: or if he wasn't, you know, if I could beat him, then I'd say, I don't want, I want the match until he gets a little more season. So it's kind of fun for me to think like, yeah, maybe there's a possibility he'd smash me. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, I guess we could talk about the Eddie Hall match. Yeah. Yeah. Brian, Brian up. But to me, for me,
John Brzenk: approaching a match of an unknown like brian shaw he just seems so so powerful in his cup and his form is so big and long and his hand is so strong that i don't think i would even try to as bad as my hook is at this point in my life
John Brzenk: I don't know if I would even try to top roll that. I mean, I think it takes longer for him to build his frame and be more stable side to side. I've run into strong men that are really not experienced arm wrestlers, and they're very difficult to beat and to top roll. The easier approach is to actually go wrist to wrist and take that direction sideways because that's not...
John Brzenk: Like I said, it just takes a lot longer to build that type of strength, even if you're a super strong guy like Brian is. So in the way Eddie's built, I mean, if Eddie has the experience and the framework to be able to
John Brzenk: go wrist to wrist with Brian, I think that's the approach that I would take. I see that Eddie's been training with Neil and some of the stuff Neil's been showing him is this back pressure thing. And I look at that and go, that isn't going to work against Brian from some of the matches that I've seen him training. His ability to come across the table in his hand and wrist strength, I think, is going to shut that down completely.
John Brzenk: So you are basically saying that the guy is tall, strong hand, hard to top roll him. Strong form, strong hand, long limbs. I mean, he's across the table. It's going to be very difficult even for a top top roller to top roll him. I think the easier approach is to, you know, to have the strength of someone like a Babayev and just hook him and then, you know, see how stable his upper arm is going sideways. But yeah.
John Brzenk: Would you pull him? Yeah, that would be my approach. I mean, I honestly maybe would try to test back pressure on him, but I wouldn't be surprised. I would be shocked if he wasn't able to really shut that down. And then I would just go inside if I had the opportunity to pull him in the future. And yes, of course, I would love just to...
John Brzenk: To pull him, yeah. Yeah. The unorthodox guys like that, I mean, are always interesting. I mean, because they're not, it's a whole different approach than seasoned arm wrestling, arm wrestlers, right? So it's, sometimes it's good. Sometimes it's, sometimes it's, you know, it's tough to change your mindset on how you should approach a match when they're just ridiculously strong like that.
John Brzenk: And what's your opinion? Who's going to win Brian or Eddie? From what I can see, it looks like to me, Brian is going to win. He'll, he'll be able to control Eddie. And especially if Eddie just tries to top roll, if he does what he's been showing in his video footage of just going back pressure, I think Brian will easily shut that down. And, um,
John Brzenk: Rich D' Whether or not, Eddie can make that transition in his brain to like the back pressure didn't work i'm getting sucked into a hook, now I have to move forward instead of back and try to hold that off. Rich D' yeah but no Brian looks looks very comfortable once he gets kind of a little bit behind his arm as long as he doesn't rush it I mean i'm sure that he can he can take it to a point where he just basically gives up.
John Brzenk: And that's what I would hope to see. I would hope that Brian just controls the match and gets in a comfortable position and just lets it bleed because the worst thing that could happen is two strong guys like that end up moving hard and fast to try to pin the other. We've all seen what can happen if you're not, if your structure and your frame isn't built for arm wrestling. And those are exactly the type of guys that I see
Engin Terzi: you know can physically hurt themselves if they're not careful but they've got some time under their their uh their belt with the understanding the sport which is good but yeah i have a question do you do you believe that like someone like brian like i see that he's very dedicated and i and i like that someone like him to like put his heart into arm wrestling is very good for us
Engin Terzi: and it is an honor and do you believe that if this guy seriously gets into it like just say four years five years do you think there is a possibility him to become like someone threat to today's really top arm wrestlers i'd have to i'd have to just see where he's at right now but yeah i know he's got the obviously
John Brzenk: potential very unusual frame. I mean, if his if his bone structure, if his tendons and ligaments are half as strong as his bone structure is, he's going to be Yeah, he's got tremendous potential. But we all you know, you know, as well as I do that arm wrestling is weird, right? There's a there's been plenty of really strong individuals that have tried to participate in and dedicated some time in the arm wrestling. And they just saw that x factor we just wasn't there. I don't know if it's the
John Brzenk: neurological the speed the fast twitch the the tendons whatever but just the way that some of us are built is just you know better for arm wrestling yeah it's it's it's after 40 years it's still difficult for me to explain i don't know what what differentiates someone that's probably incredibly coordination coordination all the muscle groups
John Brzenk: I'm just thinking that it's some type of the way the muscle and bone structure is on certain people. It's hard to explain. So, I mean, Eddie, yeah, he might, or not Eddie, Brian might be just, you know, a natural that's going to be able to take it to a super high level. But then again, I wouldn't be surprised if he reaches a point and still has trouble with guys that are just super natural at the sport. Mm-hmm.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so let's talk about King of the Table matches. I saw the whole card, 10 matches. In my opinion, it is the best card overall. Best card, like...
John Brzenk: Yeah, is it the first time King of the Tables had this many matches? Yes. I mean, it's almost like the East versus West thing. People were going to spend their whole day watching arm wrestling versus the three, four matches that King of the Tables had in the past. Yeah. And also Brian versus Eddie match together. Yeah. Is that going to be the final match?
Engin Terzi: No, the final match would be very big disrespect to Levan, you know. Oh, Levan. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I haven't really been keeping track, to be quite honest. I forgot that it's Jerry and Levan in the big match. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The world super heavyweight match, you know. Yeah, no. You can't put anything, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm looking, really looking forward to that because Jerry, boy. Yeah, let's talk, listen, don't start there yet. Devon't start there yet, okay. Yeah, because I remember when I was asking you about
John Brzenk: Jerry versus Genadi, and then you said that, again, if Genadi goes outside, you will see he's going to lose. And I never forget that the same exact thing happened, you know, and I was like, are you sure he can? And he said, yeah. Yeah, and plus just the surprisingly ease that Jerry had against the Kurdecha. I mean, if he can build off of that, if he's coming in that... No, no, he's about 10% stronger than that. Stronger. I mean, I think he's got legit chances to...
Engin Terzi: get in his spot. If he can get in this spot. I mean, I don't think he needs to rush it. I think he just needs to jam in that spot that he gets into and then he can pull five minutes there. Try to believe try to believe the big man out. Yeah, that's, that would be my plan. But yeah, no, very exciting. Okay, so let's start. Let's start from some other matches. Let me let me check the list. But we can start from
John Brzenk: Let's start from the ladies. Oh, okay. Gabriela and Barbora. I'm sure that you know both of them. You know Barbora? I know them, but I don't know. I couldn't predict. I don't know. It's so difficult for me to even analyze Barbora.
John Brzenk: that, but just because I'm not, you know, don't even get to, you know, toy around. I mean, I, I guess maybe I pulled with Gabby a little bit and yeah, I'm ridiculous, but I don't know. I, I honestly can't, I can't predict or even comment. Okay. Kevin Palco versus Joseph Maranto. Do you know them? Uh-huh. Joseph. Yeah. No, I don't know who he's pulling against. Kevin, Kevin, Kevin Palco. I think that's the training partner of Tata Chinks.
John Brzenk: Oh, okay. So, Ohio guy. So, United States, Arizona against Ohio. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And who is winning here? Emil? Well, I have to hear again. I mean, I know how strong Joseph is. I mean, if I'm not careful with him... You know how strong he is? Yeah, if I'm not careful with him, he pins me. So, I mean, it just depends.
John Brzenk: Yeah, no, he's extremely strong inside. Ridiculously strong inside. I don't know how well he can defend against the top role. He's a little bit smaller frame, but ridiculous. I mean, he's almost kind of on the level of the Romanian kid. Oh, no, Mogova. Daniel Prokopcik. Prokopcik, yeah. Ridiculous. Wow, I didn't know this.
John Brzenk: yeah yeah he's how is it that he is he's ranked like number 10 or something in the u.s um maybe he has a problem to get in his position yeah oh no i don't know i i don't know to me in my mind he's fairly new to the sport he's a young kid i i've only really seen him around the last two three years here in arizona so i'm just assuming that he just really hasn't gotten out um to improve himself but yeah no i don't know who set that match up but that's uh
Engin Terzi: He's definitely worthy of that high level of a match. That's very good. Very good to hear that, because I don't know the guy. Let's go with Lachlan versus Lars. You have pulled Lars, but have you ever even trained with Lachlan?
John Brzenk: Yeah, no Lachlan Lachlan spent a week or so here a couple times or at least two or three days here, I think slept on the floor here. Yeah, but that was probably three years ago. I think Lachlan has definitely gotten a lot better. He's he's definitely shown in his videos that he's he's training like a madman and he's doing everything in his in his
John Brzenk: ability to become a better arm wrestler, uh, his, his match that I remember just recently against, uh, Krasimir. I mean, obviously he's right there with the top of the top. Um, he, he lost Pauline convincingly, but yeah, we did with Krasimir match was closer. Yeah. Very close. Uh, that was in Dubai. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And Lars, Lars lost to Michael and then he lost to Matt Mask in Orlando. Yeah.
John Brzenk: I don't really know, see where this one's going. I mean, I'm assuming that Lachlan probably won't try to attack Lars' wrist, so Lars' flop wrist press won't be on the table. I mean, I don't think, I think it's just going to be who's got the stronger arm.
John Brzenk: Lars does have a press, though, right? Yes, that's how we will go, probably. Here again, you've got two shoulder rollers like that. I think it comes down more to, I mean, each one has the ability to pin the other. It's really about the confidence and the timing and who gets there first. So, yeah, I'm going to say that that match goes just who gets their shoulder in there first. Yeah. I mean, either one might be able to hold it off a little bit, but
John Brzenk: uh, it'll ruin their day. I mean, if they, if they're on the losing end of the first match, I can see it swinging, um, you know, one way or the other based on that. So QSA in the close match. First match is going to be critical. Yeah. Who's, who's brave enough and who's, who's willing to, you know, just put it all out there and be there first. Okay. We have Cody West versus Tobias. You know, Tobias from Sweden, the young guy with left arm.
John Brzenk: Yeah. Tobias is a good match. A very good match with left arm. Yeah. Tobias is a top roller. Big, long, long arm dude that's got a great top roll. And... Corey with left arm is different than right arm. With right arm, Corey is going like this. With left arm, more pronating. Well, I still think Corey's really one of the most difficult arm wrestlers to top roll. So, Tobias might...
John Brzenk: have a problem and if he can't top roll corey i mean i see corey winning that match um but if he's able to get out of his hand um and well we've seen even matches with corey where he gets
John Brzenk: He has control the first couple of matches and then gets wore down a little bit. Yeah. So, I mean, that's the, you know, maybe Tobias needs to look at that and say, that's, that's probably what, how it's going to go down. So I've got to be ready for, for going. Just remember that was right arm match, right arm match. With right arm, Corey is pulling with like wrist curl and pin. With left arm, Corey is,
John Brzenk: Yeah, but his hand and wrist are still ridiculous to deal with. Yeah, that should be a good match. So you are saying Corey has the small edge? I'm going to give Corey the edge, yeah. I'm going to have to root for the home team. Okay, now the things are getting more familiar. Matt Match versus Marcio Barboza.
John Brzenk: they they certainly have pulled plenty of times before right i saw them one time at wl matt was top rolling and beating him but i don't remember the other matches i'm sure they pulled before other than that but matt matt has the advantage on the frame the size the hand the better top roll marcio is more aggressive more relies on speed hard hitting um
John Brzenk: Yeah. If he's, if Marcio is on and aggressive and can keep his, you know, keep his hand from being turned and, and, and hits that posting top roll that he has perfectly. I think Matt's going to go right. We'll go right down. But if he doesn't, if he doesn't do it perfect, I mean, Matt to me has all the other advantages to, to win the match. If it goes inside, obviously Marcio is going to win.
John Brzenk: uh i don't see matt is being you know that strong and stable when it goes wrist to wrist he relies on that long linky arm and the hand strength and the hand size to do his top roll but um yeah he's he's he's in danger of being flash pinned everybody's in danger to being flash pinned by marcio he's if he hits it hits it's you know it's perfect hit um
John Brzenk: He needs to have his wrist, right? He's more of a top roller like Travis. He's really knuckles high, relies on his hammer strength, going straight back. So he's not really relying on his hand strength. No, but whenever you go side, your wrist must carry. Yeah, but he goes mostly back more than he does side. So it's that posting top roll that's really dangerous for guys like Matt and myself and many others that
John Brzenk: that you almost have to commit to a little bit of a cut before you do your top roll to get that under control. If you try to just top roll with that, then it can get ugly because those guys are comfortable with their pulling off the strap and having their knuckles high. So yeah, good match.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so let's go. Dave Chaffee is pulling Gabor Botta Dukat. Gabor is from Hungary and the current WAF champion in super heavyweight. But especially the super heavyweight at WAF is just like when all the guys are pulling professional at the East versus West. Of course, those guys are very, very, very strong, but we don't know how strong they are. And Dave Chaffee said that recently he has been training without so much pain.
John Brzenk: Yeah. No, Dave Chafee, in my mind, still is the top of the heap. If Dave Chafee is coming in claiming that he's healthy and not hurting, I mean, he's, in my mind, maybe, I mean, he's one of the top, top guys. I mean, I would love to see him pull, you know, the winner of Jerry and LeVon. I mean, I think he's that good. I know he struggles a little bit with his hand and wrist. He gets himself into positions where he gets a little bit wore out, but
John Brzenk: As far as pure horsepower, side pressure, strength off the go, there's no one that is as strong as Dave is. I don't know who he's pulling against. I really don't know the guy that you're mentioning, but if the kid's able to do anything with Dave Chafee, kudos. Do you remember Frank Lamparelli actually top rolled Dave? Dave had this shoulder pressure.
Engin Terzi: he won comfortably, but after he is losing his wrist, you know? Yeah. That's really strange to me because, um, four or five years ago when I pulled Dave, I mean, he just, he seemed, um, unmovable as far as his hand and wrist went. I mean, so. Yeah. At that time Dave was pulling like more like this. Now he started to pull in with this and then he is like,
John Brzenk: Occasionally gets out of position because of that. Yeah, he's more pronation dominant right now. Yeah. Anyway, so let's go. Very interesting match. Sandris versus Rustam. Two contrasting styles. Completely contrasting styles, right? No, Sandris can pull inside, shoulder press side. He's not going to pull. I dare him to pull inside with Rustam. I dare him. You will be surprised. I dare him.
Engin Terzi: he's listening i do don't don't you remember russian paul put in break in orlando paul and russell made a war inside you know yeah yeah so this is heavier category 105. rustam is like 97 98 kilo yeah and then uh did you see lately sundries sundries looks big strong yeah but but the the safe the safe approach will be to to to
John Brzenk: you know, get on Rustem's hand, which isn't an easy task. The way Rustem pulls with that high knuckles and then just comes quickly crashing down with, you know, onto your wrist. He's really not using his hand strength to do it. He's just using his lat and his back to just kind of, you know, jab straight down on your wrist. It's tough to stop. And he's so explosive. I mean, although, like you say, okay, if Sandras is able to stop it, if he's able to hook him and able to stop it, then...
John Brzenk: He's got a chance, but it's still a slim chance to me in my mind. I mean, but Russ has been a little bit off and, you know, out of it for a couple of three years were when and when I knew him. Well, you know, so maybe he's not what I remember him being, you know, 10 years ago, 15 years ago. Mm hmm.
Engin Terzi: Oh, you're the promoter. You can't give me an opinion. No, I'm just thinking that I don't believe any of them, like neither of them will dominate. I think that match is going to
John Brzenk: Like, stop somewhere. Yeah, well, I would love for it to be, like you say, if Saunders can really hold his own, I would love for it to see it go wrist to wrist. I hope Rustem is able to get it into the wrist so he can pull in his power. And then that'll be the most enjoyable. If Saunders just ends up stonewalling him with a high-handed top roll and Rustem...
Engin Terzi: rustum pulls from some weird position because he doesn't have his hand then it's not going to be as as enjoyable for me um yeah yeah and and and now another great match pauline versus krasimir incredible match yeah no i mean 105 105 kilo and we saw 105 kilo
John Brzenk: Paulin, very dangerous. He pulled against Lachlan in Dubai and he was domination. Yeah, so if we base it on that, yeah, we base it based on their last pulls, I mean, you would think Paulin probably has a little bit of an advantage, right? Say again? You would think that Paulin has the advantage, right, if we were basing it on their previous matches? Yeah, it's not really. It's not really because, like,
Engin Terzi: Krasimir is much more experienced than Lachlan, much more experienced. And Pauline used to be very explosive, but once he was stopped, he didn't do well. But in the Ruslan Babaya match, he had a war with him. Even after he was stopped, he still fought very well. And I am sure that now he's progressing too.
Engin Terzi: And I know that Krasimir can pull long matches. I kind of believe that since it is like six rounds, it may even go seven rounds. And I think that Paulin will be the offensive guy. But I don't know if he can pin him one time, two time, but I think the match eventually will stop. But I don't know who's going to...
John Brzenk: uh guest house right right right right i i would agree completely it's a king of the table of six matches right yes six rounds yeah it may go to the seven rounds yeah so yeah so it does help krazy you know in that respect and i i completely agree with you i think paul lynn is is much more dangerous off the go much more explosive he has a little bit of a top roll ability
John Brzenk: whether or not he tries to use that against Krasny. Oh, Krasny does also. I mean, Krasny is known for his hook pulling, but he does possess a top role. But yeah, you know, I agree completely. Krasny's probably more the endurance guy. Will be comfortable even if he's in a losing position to be able to just hang there and hold and be calm about it or call in
John Brzenk: really needs to decide what what he wants to do does he want to be super aggressive and still and still be like going 100 you know completely full full throttle on the gas because that that wears you out a lot more than than just maintaining a good position and also kind of putting in the uh
John Brzenk: the hold mode and trying to outlast Krazy and then just occasionally blast when he feels like Krazy is moved out of position or is taking a breath. I think there's going to require some little chess match. I mean, if Paul goes in at just full bore, full throttle, then I think it might be dangerous for him if
John Brzenk: Krazy is able to stop it, like you say, because I think Krazy will have the better endurance. But if Paul plays his cards right, I think Paul can do just the same thing. But he just has to be able to be aware and understand, okay, wait, I'm not pinning it. It's not going down. Okay, take a deep breath and go into long-distance mode. Mm-hmm.
Engin Terzi: Somebody just asked, would John pull against Yoshi? And the other day we were talking with you on the phone about the same thing. And I know I need to remind you something. Whenever I said this match and ask you, you said Todd is going to kill him. You remember or not? Yeah, I did. I did. Yeah. Were you surprised? Were you surprised? I know the Yoshi of old, great arm wrestler, but
John Brzenk: I just figured he was out of it for the last four years. The last I heard from him, you know, five, six years ago through David Houghton, he says, you know, he's done. He's hung it up. He's not arm wrestling. And you walk away from the sport for that length of time, it's tough to bounce back to, you know, a high level, let alone a Todd Hutchings level. So, yeah, no, I figured Todd was going to just crush him. But no, it ended up being an awesome match. But, yeah.
John Brzenk: um based on based on how well he did against todd hutchins i mean i might not have a chance in hell but i would still love to pull yoshi again yeah yeah i think it would be great yeah yeah he he had some kind of how to say
John Brzenk: He was obsessed about beating you. Yeah, no, no, no. And he's, he's definitely, he's definitely learned the ways of, it's not really the King's move, but really positioning himself. Open on top row, not even top row, but the shoulder is about. Really tough to pin that, pin that. And he's, he always had great endurance. So, um, it would definitely be a tough battle for sure for anybody. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, and what did you think about that match?
John Brzenk: Were you surprised? Oh, I'm super surprised and excited. Oh, yeah, I don't know. David you like it? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, of course. I was, you know, I felt for both of them. I felt, well, I was excited for Yoshi because, like I said, I figured he had no chance. But then once Todd kind of got in that position, I thought to myself, oh, that's still very comfortable for Todd. Todd can pull like that and still, you know,
John Brzenk: outlast he's he's got incredible endurance and we'll just eventually get him but i could i could definitely see the spare and and worry on todd's face i was like he's in trouble yeah he was but listen he did a lot of adjustments during that match a lot of adjustments yeah and he did even a little bit like shoulder pressure yeah yeah yeah i think the last time i pulled yoshi on stage i had to i had to resort to that
John Brzenk: quick surprising shoulder roll because I wasn't able to do anything with him outside. He was outlasting me and it was embarrassing for me. So yeah, it's nice to see the Todd. Yeah. I went outside. I was like, can I, it was a great match. He said it was my final match. I finished. I said, are you crazy? Like you are coming out of retirement and I'm pulling such a great match. I said like, you're not going anywhere. Yeah. And maybe he doesn't understand how good,
Engin Terzi: Todd Hutchings is. Maybe he just thought Todd Hutchings was like a mediocre give me match. Todd Hutchings is like incredible. Yeah. Yeah. I was, I was very surprised. I love the event. You fed him to the top, top, top guy. I didn't, I didn't, he wanted to pull Devon. You're right. I said, I said, I said, listen, Devon is set for Petrenko and I think Devon is like,
Engin Terzi: little bit high level to start. And he said, okay. I said, do you want anyone else? He said, no, I want Devon. And, and he said, I can wait. And I said like, okay, but I, I gave him a few names. No, no, no. I said, how about Tata Shinks? He's like, okay, let's go. Like, yeah, yeah. I liked it, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I liked it. No, he definitely needs to stay in the field because he's, he brings, yeah, a little flavor to the,
Engin Terzi: to the sport, you know, being from, from Asia and Japan and, and, you know, being as good as he is, it's just, it's great. Incredible. Yeah. Yeah. Um, last two things I will ask you. One is let's go before we go to Levan versus Jerry, let's go East versus West 16, Ermes Gasparini versus Michael Todd. Um,
John Brzenk: Michael's looking really strong, really good. Really big. Yeah. But Ermias is not, hasn't let off the gas either. So, yeah. And the winner is going to pull against the winner of Jerry versus Levan. Jerry versus Levan. Yeah.
John Brzenk: Boy, it's so hard for me to even predict that. If you would have asked me six months ago, I would have said Ermes easily just because Ermes handled him so well at 200 pounds the last time I think they pulled back in Italy. And Ermes just has gotten to be just a monster. Strength, size, speed, experience, everything. But Michael is... I've never seen Michael quite as...
John Brzenk: as together in in his training and his in his progression and um i mean obviously to be able to beat gannotti uh he's uh it's not going to be it's not going to be easy for hermes memories and hermes has had a hard time with that kind of back pressure king's move top roll i mean devin
John Brzenk: completely destroyed him, completely exposed them. So I think, I think that one didn't even need that. That one just directly took it from. Yeah. Yeah. I said, if Michael can do that, then that's Michael's to, to, but they will definitely improve a lot. His riser is dressed after Devon match. He really focused there only there, only there. And I think he will be.
John Brzenk: Like better than when he pulled against Devon. But I think that both are very good. Yeah. Well, I think Ermes has to approach it with the fact that he's got to maintain his energy. He's got to be explosive. He either has to win quick or lose quick.
John Brzenk: he can't let himself get into a first match battle where it ends up going anything longer than 10, 15 seconds. Cause, um, if he lets down at all and Michael gets a little traction and, and, and lets the match go a little bit, um, then it becomes Michael's, you know, in Michael's favor. I think Michael's got the better endurances and, um, I, I, I,
John Brzenk: picture Ermes being the race car and he needs to just be real deliberate and quick about his movements and be explosive and win quickly and be very careful about... Or not quickly, but just go up, up, up, up and then... And then be willing to let it go. I think if Ermes gets...
John Brzenk: a bad start or something weird happens where he's out of position he he shouldn't fight he i mean i hate to say this but i think especially if we're talking you know best of it's going to be best of five so you only you can only have to win three right yeah so a little different question for you question they hold and they're in strap ready go who is this wrist is surviving
John Brzenk: i see well if michael has his way michael's wrist will get bent back but he's going to maintain his high position his high knuckles and just use the strap and go sideways and then it then it becomes ermie's cupping ability to bring michael's hand from this position to this position so whether ermies will do that or will armies just stay outside and maintain his high hand position i don't think ermies is
John Brzenk: You know, I wasn't gonna say brave enough, but, and I'm sure that's the right thing to do is to try to control Michael's top roll with a little bit of handcuffing before you top roll them. If Ermes just stays out with a high hand top roll, it can be difficult to deal with Michael. I mean, I can see it, both them, both going into their top roll move and just being stationary right in the center of the table. I only realized one thing that like,
Engin Terzi: Kamil just tried direct shoulder pressure on Michael's arm. Genadi tried that. I think the way to do that, to climb up, up, up, and then to the far side of Michael's hand to do the shoulder pressure. If Ermes can do that, then I think that he has a chance. Yeah, I think Ermes needs to...
John Brzenk: pull Michael like Frank Lamparelli. And I know he's not built like Frank, but he needs to commit. And I advise Ermes to do the same with Devon. Like you need to commit a little bit of your hand control and cupping to bring that high hand top roll down. And then you can top roll it. So you need to almost kind of try to hook a little bit and then top roll.
John Brzenk: If you just go right from top roll from the beginning and they've... I mean, hook and Michael is very hard, John. Yeah, but I think it's the easiest approach. Oh, really? Wow. Yeah. I mean, you don't want... Ermes is not really like that. Yeah, you don't want to finish, but you don't want to finish with the hook. What I would say is hook and then top roll. Just to secure your wrist. Yes, you got to secure your wrist. If you end up just trying to top roll like this,
John Brzenk: Michael's going to use that strap and be able to maintain that same position. And then it becomes really difficult. Once you've said go and both have gone to that position, then it really makes it difficult to try to get control with your hand strength in that cup. Jerry Martin, you know, Malin Jr. asking. He called me Egan. Anyways, my name is Egan.
Engin Terzi: Please ask John if he is interested in knowing how Devon can beat Levan or how he can beat Devon today. I don't understand the second part, but I don't know. David you understand? No. Okay, maybe let me do my translation. How do you think that Devon would beat Levan?
John Brzenk: Well, we saw a glimmer of hope, uh, and their first match in the last East versus West. I think that was the perfect technique. Um, uh, he's almost kind of an open pronation top role in the draft. After round one, the restaurants just didn't do well. Do you think that that is the best way or do you think he could train? Obviously the best way I think LeVon was able to switch it up and really commit to
John Brzenk: going with the dead wrist shoulder roll. And now Devon has to rethink that. Like, okay, well, I mean, I had the position that I wanted to have. If I could have maintained that and he didn't do that flop rest, flop wrist press, I think Devon would have won that match. And Devon probably would have won the rest of the matches. So it was just a hairline decision on LeBron's part to make that desperation move because I think he felt like
John Brzenk: He wasn't able to match that. So now Devon has to go back to the drawing board and think, okay, okay, now I just need, I need, that strength was there. So he should basically, he should do the same thing? Yeah, that strength was there. Now he just needs to be prepared and defend. But do you think that Devon will be the same guy next time? Do you think that Devon should try the same exact thing? I have no reason to think that Devon wasn't completely, absolutely perfect.
John Brzenk: prepared for that last Devon match. So I don't know how much. Yeah, because he was, he was coming back from the wrist injury. If you remember the tendon was torn. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's hard to say. I mean, I think, yeah, I think Devon's approach was perfect. And I think he's, you know, he just failed and not being prepared for the, whether or not he can prepare himself for that type of load that's going down with a dead wrist like that, that's coming from LeVon. Um, maybe, maybe he, Devon's,
Engin Terzi: the way he's built, maybe that's never going to happen, but, uh, he had, he had part of the formula down. So you are saying that if that, if there is a way, that is the way. That is the way. Okay. Okay. So another thing I want to ask, um, what do you think about Laletin?
John Brzenk: And then now you saw the legend against more also in this, I don't know. I don't know if you remember both matches and letting looks very, very dominant and. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But Tally, I mean, just, I've seen him just be super fit, lean and strong. And then other times he's, he's, he seems like he's gained a hundred pounds, so I don't know. And I've got no experience.
John Brzenk: to even know what he feels like. So I, it's hard for me to comment, but, uh, yeah, I mean, to me, the guy, the way to beat that guy is probably for me or for is to try to hook him, go wrist to wrist, use that long frame against them by, um, taking away that top roll. But I know it's, it's extremely difficult. Very hard. He can also lower his hand, you know? Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: justin relax for seconds his name john always best my hero god bless from justin wow thank you man yeah anyways uh okay let's go to the the final subject yeah jerry versus levan yeah uh like i said we spoke about it a little earlier um i think jerry if he's coming in super strong
John Brzenk: uh a lot of it's going to be on the setup um lavon has to be committed to moving forward not moving backwards or even sideways if he gives jerry even the slightest bit of room to to get behind his arm um i can see jerry making it a very difficult day for lavon i don't know if lavon's
John Brzenk: be able to pull or if anybody could pull jerry out of that position if he's allowed to get in that position so um the match the match for me to me is how levon approaches it i mean if he stands tall and moves forward and is not intimidated by um you know the compact size of jerry uh and challenges him in the center of the table
John Brzenk: then LeLan can smash him just as easily as Ermes did. But if he's a little slow, a little off the go, and he thinks he can... And he puts the shoulder behind? And if he thinks he can lazily just go back pressure top roll against Jerry, that's going to be a bad day. But do you think that, like, okay, this didn't work well against Jerry, but do you think that there may be someone
Engin Terzi: And that there's someone maybe Levan to beat Jerry with an outside move. Like, do you think that Jerry Levan may be that strong that like style wouldn't matter or not? I think it's, it's going to require more.
John Brzenk: forward side than back side. I think if Jerry's able to get his fist into his pack at all and tight to his body with wrist or not wrist, typically without his wrist, it's really difficult to get him out of that. I can see Levan having a hard time. So you are saying that Levan to shoulder press Jerry is
John Brzenk: more possible than top rolling him? It would be the easier approach. It'd be the safer approach. It would be the approach I tried the first match. Because the worst thing that could happen to LaVon is make a mistake going outside top roll and Jerry get it getting it stuck. And then now the endurance card comes into into play, right? I mean, how much? How long does a match go like that? How long does he fight? Where
John Brzenk: If he tries to go forward and inside and he gets beat, then at least it's over with quick. Then he can change up and do something different. And if he wins quick, then he knows he can pull it off. But the worst case for LeBron would be to fail in what he feels is his safe position and then end up getting into a long, hard match. Anyone who doesn't have the downside or hand
John Brzenk: tough enough, and then just you end up like this, where he's pressing here, then you're in trouble. You're on break. Your idea is you need to have here really good and maybe even a little bit low. Yeah, he needs to fight really, really concentrate on the center and make sure that yeah, that he maintains the center position or his side of the table. If he lets Jerry jam and get out his side of the of the top of the table, it's it's gonna be hard for anybody.
John Brzenk: Including Levan. Yeah, yeah. And where is your money? I know you like the bet. I don't, but you do. Well, the safe bet is still with Levan. He's a strong, strong favorite. But I won't be surprised if Jerry, you know, I'd be really surprised. Well, I wouldn't even be that much surprised if Jerry does to Levan what he did to Kurdecha. Yeah.
John Brzenk: Yeah, I didn't expect it. I didn't expect it. It's not unrealistic to think that, you know, Lavon relies on his size and his wrist and his hand size to be so dominant. But with Jerry, it's not going to matter. I mean, if they get tied into the strap and yeah, how strong is Lavon's hammer curl? I mean, probably pretty decent still, but I would have thought. You don't want to be caught there. You don't want to be caught there. No.
Engin Terzi: Because it will get tired. It's not one round. You need to beat the guy four times. Yeah. Yeah. And this Justin guy asked you, thank you. Ask John if he would like to know how to beat Devon today. I can tell him how. He's going to teach you how to beat Devon. Oh, wonderful. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. John.
Engin Terzi: Thank you very, very much, my friend. Thank you. It's always an honor. It's always a pleasure. And we have been here for like exactly one hour, 60 minutes and 28 seconds. Thank you for your time. Not too long, not too short. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. When it's just like one and a half hours, it's too long. Yeah, you're right. And are you making, refresh my memory, are you making a trip to Atlanta City or you're not? No, I think I will be in Italy. Okay. There was one guy, Italian guy, he loves arm wrestling. He's an arm wrestler. He just came to
Engin Terzi: um, East versus West event. And then after he went back to Italy, he was trying to save someone's life. The other guy was droning. So he went there to save him, but he unfortunately died. And I'm going to, um, he's, he was an also East versus West fan. I'm going to bring East versus West, a world champion belt. There will be a tournament. Uh, and then also he will be remembered like his memory.
Engin Terzi: And I think I'm going to Italy to be part of this. Yeah. Well, enjoy. Italy is beautiful. I imagine it's probably a little chilly at this time of year, a little snow maybe in the mountains, but nice. Yeah. December is always probably cold everywhere in Europe, but yeah. Yeah. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Take care of yourself. Thanks. Bye.
