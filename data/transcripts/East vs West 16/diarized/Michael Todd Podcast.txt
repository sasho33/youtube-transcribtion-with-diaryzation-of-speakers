Host (possibly Malin): Hello, hello, everyone. Michael is going to join us in probably one minute.
Adnan: Hello, Adnan. Oh, somebody already. No need to delete him. Just ban him. Anyone who is looking for trouble, just ban him. No need to delete. Yeah.
Host (possibly Malin): Hello, hello, hello, Ferguson. Hello, Bob Guy. Hello, True Loyalty. Yeah. Ivan has some shoulder issues, as far as I know. But still, you know, Vitalii is very good, you know.
Host (possibly Malin): Even in hook is very good. But I for sure know that Vitalii, sorry, Ivan has been injured. Shoulder. I don't know how is it. Hello, Michael. Hey, brother. How you doing, sir? Good, good. And you? Malin, just cleaning. I got a cleaning mode. I was vacuuming upstairs and I was like, oh, crap, I'm late. So I had to get down here real quick. How you doing, brother? Good, good.
Host (possibly Malin): How are you? Training hard, man. Training hard. Yep. So where are you now, Michael? Like you picked for Genadi match and then you, you just did a little bit back step a little bit, just to make sure that you, you know, like to make the, you know,
Host (possibly Malin): arrow go more you first like a little bit pull back and then you know right yeah so at a peak so each time it's been a peak
Michael Todd: I come back, I reassess, lightweight for a couple of weeks, and then I reprogram all my arm wrestling-specific lifts, right? Yeah. So did that for Camille. Was quite a bit stronger for Genadi than I was Camille. I mean, anywhere between 8% and 20% on certain lifts. Came back on from this one, set new PRs, readjusted my programming. And I've got big goals for this prep. I think I'm going to – I know I'll break all my PRs. Mm-hmm.
Michael Todd: I'll just keep moving forward from there. But, yeah, I feel good. I feel healthy. My heaviest morning weight, like stripped in the morning, is 300.2. I've been 300 two different times. Heaviest evening weight, dressed like this, 314, stripped around 311. So it just varies how much food I take in, how much water I drink, all that good stuff. A question for you. You won three matches in a row.
Host (possibly Malin): Correct? No, four. Four, yeah. Lamparelli, Lars, Kamil and Genadi. The question, when you win, do you go home with a mindset that you did everything right for the preparation or you always learn even you win?
Michael Todd: I've learned from every victory. So the first one was when I came back here and I had a controlled setting and I pulled Pablo, right? So I pulled Pablo in February. I realized, okay, cool. I kind of got the nerves out of the way, but I'm still not where I thought I was going to be at.
Michael Todd: So then we went and pulled Frank. I learned a lot from there that, you know, I had a great game plan, but the emotions got to me and they took over. Came back and had a good program, good setup for Lars. After that, you know, we thought we was doing the heavyweight world title versus Dottie Cannon. That didn't happen. So I went for Camille and the super heavyweights. Once I committed to the super heavyweights, I basically just quit going to bed hungry at night. And from there, I just said, oh, the goal's LeVon. The goal has always been LeVon. LeVon's always been the goal.
Michael Todd: And I know Jerry's gonna pull LeVon next week, so I have no idea what's gonna happen. I believe that LeVon's gonna win, but I've said it every time someone's asked me if Jerry gets to stop once.
Michael Todd: And LaVon tries to hang on and pull through it, I think it's over. The objective is LaVon. The goal is overall number one. The goal is to prove to the world all things are possible. But yeah, I mean, every time I come home, and something I've never done before is these analysis videos. You're reviewing these matches and seeing how my opponents, I've never done that. My entire arm wrestling career, I never researched my opponents. I just always thought what I did, if I do it at its best, it's going to be better than what they do.
Michael Todd: um now i'm finding out okay this he's he's susceptible to this or he does this or whatever and i'm learning a lot so each time i come back even after ganadi i came back said okay i could have done this um i didn't realize i was strong enough to have been able to do that but i was i could have done this
Michael Todd: So coming forward, moving forward to Ermes, he's a different opponent. He's a different opponent. He's a stronger hand, stronger wrist. I would say I think Genadi is a more versatile opponent, but I think Ermes is a more difficult opponent because of how strong his hand and wrist are and his ability to control center most of the time. But I'm preparing for that as well. My question is, like you, when you say like you learn something, you're talking about like,
Host (possibly Malin): you made them like only like you made a mistake during the match that you could do something different or even for the preparation, like
Host (possibly Malin): Do you think that everything was right or you need some adjustments? The adjustments because of something you learned from the Genadi match or is it because now you have different opponents? Or there is no adjustment at all with the preparation? The preparation is exactly the same. Okay, so this is what I wanted to ask. This is the reason. If the ultimate goal is Devon, and I believe my path through Devon is through the strongest hand and wrist the sport's ever seen, then the goal is always preparing for Devon, right?
Michael Todd: Ermes is going to be the closest person to Lavon in a way of a difficult hand and wrist to try to take control of, to control this through the table, right? Because we know how strong he is from here and how strong this is and his riser. So my objective will be to pull him towards me without compromising my riser or my pronation.
Michael Todd: That's exactly what I have to do against LeVon. So the preparation is always for LeVon. It's just the next step is Ermes. And the programming has worked so far. There's no reason to change. And I am adding a few things. Like I had that new side pressure machine. I've been adding that in. And I feel like that's actually helping quite a bit.
Michael Todd: Yeah, the thing is, people are laughing or people are asking, like, they used to get so bored of my total body circuits that I used to do chest, back, arms, shoulders, legs, because I did all the arm wrestling specific within those workouts. And all I post now is, you know, pronation of the top knuckle riser, pronation gauge, back pressure, wrist cupping, static hold, and then outside side pressure.
Michael Todd: People are like, hey, I'm kind of wishing I could see more of Michael's old stuff. Well, I'm still doing it all. I'm just not filming, you know. I'm working the hardest I've ever worked in my life right now. The amount of time that I spend in here, especially on arm wrestling specifically, I've never put this much effort into my life. Another question. Your arm size, like, is it the biggest ever? Yeah, I mean, so I'd hit a 22-inch pump prior to Genadi, and then you measured me cold, and I think it was like,
Michael Todd: 55 or 53 and a half, I think it might've been 53 and a half cold when you measured me, when you were measuring me in Morozov. And then I came back home and I got pumped up again and I got another 22 inch pump. So I had to make sure that it wasn't a fluke, right? So 22 is the best it's been so far. I really haven't gotten anything bigger yet, although I'm four or five pounds bigger than I've been yet. No size growth in my arms. I think by the time I pull, you know, whenever I get the shot,
Michael Todd: Versus LaVon or Jerry, I believe I'll be 330, 340, 22 and a half. Are you serious? Are you serious? Wow. Yeah, I'm serious. I'll probably have a 230. 330 is 150 kilo. Yeah, I think I'll be able to. You're talking about 150, 155 kilo you plan to be. Yeah, I mean, I expect to be 30 pounds bigger than I am right now. So that means my strict morning weight would be 330. And then my weigh-in evening weight dress, 342, 345.
Michael Todd: mean i think that i don't think it's necessary i don't think i necessarily need that versus levon but the trajectory and path that i'm on i kind of feel like that's just where it's going to land like i think for armies i'll probably weigh in 10 pounds heavier than i am now in the mornings which means i could weigh weigh in dress
Michael Todd: I mean, I don't know, 319, something like that, 317, 319. And the thing is, it's not a weight thing. Just like Ermi said, he doesn't care what he weighs. He just wants to be strong. I just want to be strong. I am a full believer the bigger muscle has the potential to be the stronger muscle. So I'm just going to keep eating, keep growing, and keep training, and keep resting, keep recovering. I mean, I can't say how many weeks exactly I have left because we haven't announced the date yet, but I'm very focused.
Host (possibly Malin): The cheese fast, please don't be disrespectful, my friend, please. Anyway, so Michael, yeah, I can guarantee, like, I mean, for sure, I had never seen you 150 kilo for me.
Host (possibly Malin): Like, the other day, I think you shared the video, like, this is where Ermes makes a mistake or something, you know, something like that, you made a video. Probably, yeah. Yeah, you put the analyzing of the old machine. Mine and Ermes 2017. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Host (possibly Malin): yeah and so there you said that like hermes was 103 and you were around 120 and you said you will probably be 140 and he will be about 125 but now you are saying you will be 150 kilos not under 150 for levon for levon not hermes oh not for the hermes oh yeah no no no no no no that's that's the spring match that's the spring match you know and as you know i already said for levon which means i will beat hermes
Michael Todd: I love Ermes. He's awesome. He's a great young man. He's a very, very bright future. He's already accomplished amazing things. He's held the Super Heavyweight East versus West belt or the shield or whatever it was that he had at the time. He's going to have plenty of time to get to the top. It's just right now, it's a bad time for him. It's just a bad time. Skyler Brooks, Armwrestling says, two of the greatest. Thank you, my friend. Okay.
Host (possibly Malin): So since you started that subject, Ermes and you, yeah, my opinion, correct me if I'm wrong, there has been some times like you picked so good and then there was some, how do you call it in English, decline, you know, for some time before your bicep surgery. You had some losses. Right.
Host (possibly Malin): those times probably there has been some moments that you really doubt yourself like you i remember before the pandemic or even in the pandemic during the pandemic you like had hopes to beat levan and then you had some like defeats you understand like you've lost some matches those times did you like
Host (possibly Malin): I think you did, but like you a little bit doubted yourself that like, okay, I was thinking about beating Levan, but yeah, probably I was like dreaming. And now you coming back and now you are having that hopes in you and that target in your life. What I just tried to say that before the pandemic or during the pandemic, you believe that you could beat him.
Host (possibly Malin): or you had a chance to beat him. And then after you lost your losses, probably you lost a little bit of faith about that goal. Maybe you thought that it was maybe not possible after you're 50 years old, you understand? And, but now I see that you have, like that the confidence is coming back. You know, this is, am I correct? Yeah, so I honestly thought that I had the best shot of beating Lavon back.
Michael Todd: That 2020 area, 2019, 2020, even early 2021. Devon was a better man on that day. He beat me. Then I lost to Genadi. Then I lost to Rivas. Then I beat Todd Hutchings here. Then I lost to Angerbaev, right? And then after Angerbaev, I blew my bicep. So I had people talk about all these losses I had. I had four losses.
Michael Todd: I mean, now that's four losses out of only five matches, right? But it's four losses against Devon, who was 290 plus pounds. Genadi, who we saw what he did after he beat me. He went on to beat Dave. He went on to beat Devon. Genadi was amazing. Rivas, I was so close to winning that match. I just, you know, came up on the short end. And then, you know, I was coming off a torn bicep when I pulled on Gabayev, you know, partially tear bicep. And that was the best I could be on that day.
Michael Todd: But hey, that's how that goes. During that time, my aspirations of facing LeVon had definitely diminished. I didn't think it was going to be possible. I had so much damage. I had so much nerve damage in my hand. I atrophied my thumb a lot. The bicep did not realize how bad that was. And honestly, when the bicep tore and I had surgery in those first 13 weeks of training, my goal was not necessarily LeVon, you know.
Michael Todd: It was just I was going to obtain, I was going to re-obtain a world title. And I'm going to tell you how I planned on doing it. This is just being me transparent. I was going to partner with Bill Collins. And there was a $25,000 UAL ring that I actually gave back to them because I never got to meet anybody to pull it. Robert Drink gave it to me. He said, we find somebody worthy. You can pull them from until then it's yours. Well, he sold the thing to Bill Collins. I'm like, all right, here's your ring back.
Michael Todd: So I was going to talk to Bill within that first year, and I was going to say, hey, let's have an event, a Monster Factory UAL collaboration, and let's have an event here, and I'll pull John Brzenk for that. And so that would be the UAL world title. Now, would that make me the world champion? Overall, no. It would have made me the champion of the Ultimate Arm Wrestling League. So that, honestly, in the back of my mind, that's how I was going to become world champion again. It wasn't going to be in the East versus West. It wasn't going to be Races of LeBron. And that just made sense to me at the time.
Michael Todd: Well, then as progression happened, um, you know, you said, Hey, you want to do a contract? I'm like, I'm down, you know, you've given me the opportunity to let's do it. And so everything became a focus on, uh, East versus West. And then even when I got, I was competing at two 53 and when you offered me the world title shot versus Dottie can.
Michael Todd: didn't intend to stay there i was going to win that world title defend it once or twice and then move on to supers once that match got canceled it just sped up the process of super heavyweight so there was a belief in me after ketamine that i could be number one in the world there's a belief in me that told me that the world thought it was impossible to live on and i was going to show the world all things are possible to christ it was just a belief and that belief whether anyone else believes or not it doesn't matter i believe it
Michael Todd: And when I'm confident and I believe in myself, I'm a different person to be. And that's the biggest problem Ermes is going to have. I believe this is bigger than me. I like you messing with him. I like that you're all ready because he will fire back and I know what's waiting for us.
Host (possibly Malin): No, listen, I'm not even trying to, I think the kid's amazing. I'm not trying to talk smack. I'm not trying to do anything. No, no, no, no. I'm just telling you what I believe to be true. I believe to be true. This is natural, you know, what's happening. I like it when it's natural. Like, I really, like, I have encouraged people to do trash talk and, you know, hype the match because we need to teach some of the, especially the Eastern athletes, you know, to do this.
Host (possibly Malin): But whenever the things are real, the things are even better, you know. And yours is real. I'm not saying you are being disrespectful or something, but your confidence and it is all real, it's coming all from the heart. And then I 100% am sure that Ermes also has that, like Ermes is also very dedicated. He also has big, big dreams, you know. So there will be a,
Michael Todd: It's like class, you know, the same exact thing that was the situation with my last match. You had me versus Genadi. We both had the same path. We both wanted the same thing. Yeah. We both are very passionate. We both believe what we were saying, you know, it was only after the fact that he said, no, that issues, you know, his wrist is boss at whatever. I mean, he had said in the interview with us that his boss wasn't quite as strong, but his wrist was stronger than ever. We had the same goal.
Michael Todd: Just like me and Aramis, we have the same goal. The winner of this match gets the shot at overall number one. It's a huge opportunity. So there's no way I could possibly think that I'm the only one that wants it. I know he wants it just as bad as me. I just believe with 100% certainty in my heart and in my mind that this time is mine, that this opportunity belongs to me and I will be the one with my hand raised victory. I mean, I just believe that. Yeah. We all have our own reasons to win.
Michael Todd: our own goals, and I love it. I love it, you know? Yeah. And the catabolic tricks, what aspects of Ermes style worries you the most? Well, there's only one aspect and that's the strength of his hand and wrist and his ability to, to post up with that up pressure, hammer curl pressure this way. Like he's so strong this way.
Michael Todd: but i truly believe that his version of pressure hammer crow of back pressure that he calls back pressure which when i started arm wrestling that was just up pressure that was pulling your hand up was up pressure back pressure is when you're dragging you know pulling with your back um as long as my hand stays intact as long as my riser doesn't get severely compromised and i i have zero doubts that he will not be able to turn my palm up and this is this is his key to victory he has to do this
Host (possibly Malin): If he does not do this, he doesn't beat me. Even you lose your hand? My hand's not going to... This isn't going. This is not going to go. No, no, not the pronation. If the riser and the wrist goes, but not the pronation.
Michael Todd: He, I mean, that's kind of, that's what I'm talking about. If my hand stays in my Roger state, he's going to have to, he's got to beat my riser. And in my opinion, turn my palm, at least in this direction, which I did in our first match, I hit back. Boom. I still had pronation, but he had this and he had a cup risk and he was climb, climb, climb, climb. And then he was able to press and pin. I just can't see a world where his version of back pressure beats my version of back pressure. And I don't see a world where his cup is stronger than my pronation.
Michael Todd: i don't think he can cut my pronation and i heard you talk to john brzenk and john said he thinks it'd be best to turn me in a hook and then top row from there you're not hooking me i'm not getting hooked you know what i'm saying like i'm not getting turned in a hook so turning me into hook and then top row me is not an option um i don't know man he's he's amazing he he's a very very strong individual he's so what's most dangerous about him is he's young and he's hungry that's the most dangerous thing about him
Michael Todd: I'm not afraid of his press. You know, I've pulled stronger presses because he won't be in an advantageous position. He's going to be in a bent wrist press trying to press me. He will not have my hand. I mean, we saw both Kamil and Genadi's pressing to your arm. I mean, it doesn't look, but the way Ermes does is usually. Oh, yeah.
Host (possibly Malin): Well, that's not what he did to Vitalii. He came in and impressed Vitalii with a flop, right? Because he was here and he just dropped and flopped. Now, he does have a strong flop. But listen, listen. Laletin's hand height is a little bit different, yeah. Yeah, I don't have the leverage that Devon does. It was more possible to beat Laletin's arm, you know.
Host (possibly Malin): like then then just needing that you know once he is stopping me problem here it was like we saw also a few others beating laletin with shoulder pressure yeah and then some other i saw as well but what i just tried to say that i think like laletin may be more problematic about the hand than you when i say the hand then you are what i used to be yeah it's easy to judge me by what i used to be
Michael Todd: arm is probably... Has there been some moments that Genadi also took your wrist during the match? There was round two where I was making an adjustment here and he kicks his wrist back and gets my hand back for a second, but then it comes back in again. He didn't forcibly take it. He kicked it this way when I had my hand open and not applying pressure because I was trying to walk. Then he kicked the strap this way and got that. But in every start, every round, I took Genadi's wrist.
Host (possibly Malin): The thing is, like I said, I think Ermes is amazing. I just think it's bad timing for him. Oleg Cruzat says that, Mike, can you do to Ermes what Devon did? That is my plan. Okay. So another Logan Misiak question, Michael, if you lose, what happens next?
Host (possibly Malin): Whatever God wants to happen next, but I'm not losing, so. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So the question, you pull Ermes exactly in 2017, May, March, probably 24, 27. I don't know the date. Seven years ago. By the time this match happens, it'll almost be eight years. Yeah. I remember you telling me.
Host (possibly Malin): And then I went to Italy like for vacation type of thing. And while I was like, Oh, you were going another country, France or something.
Michael Todd: What was it that you like? I got offered the opportunity to come to Italy on someone else's dime. And while I was there, I was going to pull Ermes. I thought he was still the 95 kg guy who had just pulled, you know, there's a lot of, you know, what was it? Six months, five months earlier. And he's like, I didn't see him the entire day. Like I'm out, I'm downstairs standing up, sitting down, standing up, taking pictures, signing autographs, all that stuff. He shows up five minutes before the match. He's been up in his room the whole time. Yeah. Yeah. But did you, were you, were you in a, like a.
Michael Todd: mood to compete in italy for a competition or you were just there like i mean i mean i'm always i'm always in the mood to compete but if you're asking if that was the best version of me that year obviously not because what was it three months later i beat dave chafee travis bajan everybody i won the the wal and then i pulled push car how many months after that and we went four to two so the guy that pulled push car the guy that pulled the wl that match wouldn't look the same
Host (possibly Malin): It's just on that day, he was more prepared than me than I was to compete at that level. He had an amazing performance, but he still didn't win the match. I mean, he had everything. No, no, no, I understand. My question and what I'm curious is that, Mr. Wee, thank you, is that, like, he was a very young guy and he was... Yeah, yeah, he was... I was 44. Yeah, he was very...
Host (possibly Malin): light compared to right now it would be light heavyweight category now he is in super heavyweight category so but you also were around how much you said 260 or 122 so that probably was like 268. eight yeah 268 so so you also will be so what is your weight about 19 kgs yeah so what what is and you will probably be 15 kgs heavier than him heavier than this time as well so
Host (possibly Malin): What is your estimation? Do you do that kind of estimation? But I cannot say that the only difference between Ermes of that time to this time is not only the weight. The guy is much more experienced. That is the only guy that actually pleaded Levan Bacho Saginashvili. And you said that you were not at your best, but do you feel like
Michael Todd: you progress more than he progressed or like how do you see this from that match till now from that particular match my level in his level it probably progressed the same now i have not progressed that much further beyond my peak my previous peak was a lot higher than that match right but from that match till now i would say we both progressed about the same
Michael Todd: But the biggest thing, the biggest difference for me is I had higher peaks in my career. But this prep, this comeback, I have done arm wrestling specific lifts that I've never done in my life. Everything that I accomplished, I did without doing arm wrestling. Can you say that when you pull Ermes, you will be in the best shape of your life?
Michael Todd: Or were you already when you beat Genadi? So here's the deal. I have yet to say I'm the strongest I've ever been because there's still areas of strength that I'm not as strong as I have been in the past. I am the strongest I've ever been in arm wrestling related exercises for sure. And I would have to assume the guy that shows up to pull armies will be the strongest I've ever been. And that's going to be about 95% as strong as I'm going to be when I pull Levant.
Michael Todd: because I will be stronger you will be you will be even stronger yeah everything about people are saying I mean not people some some people you'll say comments that I got newbie gains I'm not gonna it's unrealistic for me to think I'm gonna continue to get stronger each preparation blah blah blah blah blah I'm telling you this I've said it numerous times this is beyond something that Michael Todd is capable of doing this is something that I'm doing that with through my faith and my belief that God is working through me so
Michael Todd: you doubt me all you want but I'm not the one that you're doubting here because I'm not the one that's showing up that day it's it's I'm just gonna be I'm gonna do the work I have no doubt that I'm gonna do the work I will hit every goal that I've set in this preparation and that level of strength combined with you know what I believe is my purpose to to to show the world what's possible will be too much for armies on that day
Host (possibly Malin): Oh, too much. Okay. It's going to be too much because he's not winning. Like, he's not winning. Okay. Mr. V, thanks again. It is me again. How are you? Thank you, my friend. I hope you are okay as well. Mike, who wins, Jerry or Levan and why? Greetings from Germany. My friend, we will go there. After this one, we will go totally for the king of the table. We will discuss, in my opinion,
Host (possibly Malin): the best king of the table card the other day when i wrote this some people said oh you always say that every card is the best i was talking about before east versus west now i just think that this is best king of the table card ever in my opinion the last east versus west 15 card
Host (possibly Malin): There has never been something like that. I don't know if you agree, Michael. By far. That event was just mind-blowing. Whenever I was watching Tatashins versus Kanai, I was like, what? And then you see Sago versus Reno going. You versus Genadi going. And then Alijan and Matushenko round one. I was like, wow. It's just like...
Host (possibly Malin): I mean, I love it. I love it. It was incredible event. Yeah. Anyway, so let's, let's go there. Let's go there. So, because I think we will have another podcast before Ermes match and I will have both of you, uh, if you both would be available and yeah. Do you like, how do you see this upcoming event?
Michael Todd: Malin, I think, just like you said, it's by far the best King of the Table card ever. Now, LeVon versus Devon was super hype. LeVon versus Ermes, it wasn't as hype, but it ended up being a phenomenal match, one of the best matches. I mean, watching Ermes do what he did was spectacular. But as far as the entire card, I mean, this is insane.
Michael Todd: And then you have the celebrity match, basically. You have Brian Shaw versus Eddie Hall. I mean, that's going to get a lot of news. But having Barbora versus Gabby rematch? Malin, what are you talking about? That's crazy. Marcio and Matt Mass never let us down. I love the Lachlan versus Lars match.
Michael Todd: Paul Innes versus Krozy, Rustam Sandris. Rustam Sandris is crazy. I feel like Rustam's the favorite. I think Sandris is amazing. I just think that short lever, he sinks his hook. I don't see how he doesn't sink his hook. You need to finish him four times. You will see. It's a difficult match.
Host (possibly Malin): Yeah, Sandris also is known with very good endurance. We will see. We will see. And he looks great. At that lighter weight, Sandris looks great. Yeah, yeah. He looks even bigger somehow, yeah. Yeah, he looks bigger. Because maybe he's more ripped. Maybe that's why he looks bigger. The leaner muscles look bigger. Yeah. And what is your favorite match there? LeBron and Jerry, I guess, right? I mean, that's the one I care about.
Michael Todd: Having Corey, I'll be there for Corey versus Tobias. Oh, yeah. That's going to be good. I think a lot of people are underestimating Corey, which I don't know why. I really want to see Corey get a right-handed match. We measured his left wrist. It was 9 3 quarters. We measured his right, and it was 10 1⁄2. Yeah, yeah. His right wrist is 10 1⁄2 inches because he cups and hooks right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He top rolls this way. So I'm telling you, that right arm of his is solid. I mean, he hasn't lost anyone in North America in, like,
Michael Todd: several years. Since John Match, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that's only been two years, two and a half years. But other than John, I guess the last person would have been Todd Hutchings three years ago. I don't know. It's been a while. Like, Corey's strong right-handed. Yeah, yeah. And he's getting more, like,
Michael Todd: I don't know how to say it. He's dropped the body fat as well. More athletic, you know, compared to before. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's around 400. Like, he's been 390-something in the mornings, but he's around 400. And I think he was 450 when he pulled Morris off. So, definitely a fitter version. Yeah, yeah. And I think Kamil was the worst matchup for him. I think Kamil for any... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Host (possibly Malin): Terrible, especially with left arm, with right arm too. But with left arm, you're pronating, you are in trouble, you know, for sure. We saw Laletin was almost in trouble. Almost in trouble, like a lot of trouble. Almost, almost. I would like a Corey versus Camille right-handed.
Host (possibly Malin): Cause Corey hooks. Yeah. Corey turns the, but we need to see it because he never does this coming also hooks as well, but Camille's looking way more complete. Like his training looks way more complete now. Is he really wanting to go down to one 15? He told me yes. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know if it is good idea or bad idea, but yeah.
Host (possibly Malin): I think Kamil as a super, super heavyweight with left arm, he has chance to beat anyone. Anyone. I'm not saying he would beat anyone. No, he's got a chance. Yeah. Yeah. Because I still think he can get stronger, you know? Yes. Yes, for sure. And I like Kamil. I really like, like, I mean, you look at Kamil, like there are some athletes that you would ask them to promote their event. Kamil is 365 days a year.
Host (possibly Malin): He promotes arm wrestling. He promotes himself and he does this promotion totally with the family and he has a job. It's not an easy job. He has a job all day and then he comes and trains and films. And then he posts on, uploads on social media. Kamil is good for the community. That guy is also very, very strong and Kamil is, I can say that one of those guys that like you would want everyone to do as much
Host (possibly Malin): Promotion and I love I love the way he does promote like you said involving his family and he just he does some he does some Good sense of humor sometimes good sense of humor as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah anyway, so Okay, then let's go you said that it's your favorite match usually I Go as the last one, but let's go to the last one. Go ahead and start it. Let's go to lesson. Oh
Host (possibly Malin): I mean, no, let's start with Levan versus Jerry. All right. I've said every time someone's asked me, I think Levan is way too powerful. Okay, can Levan beat Jerry, in your opinion? I know that that is your fellow American, you know, puller, and you would be happy if you would win. It's normal. But if you would be objective,
Michael Todd: Do you think that Lewand would beat Jerry in his regular style or he needs to do some adjustments? I think he can do it in his regular style. And I think he can just go more this way with it. Like he doesn't have to come back so far. I think he can just this way with it. I just think he's too strong. I think there's a chance that Jerry gets his arm injured personally.
Michael Todd: Because the way LeBron hit, look how LeBron hit Devon in like the first matches that they had. Yeah, but LeBron was going away and Jerry was going. I'm just saying like when Devon was coming in to hook him and LeBron just holds him in the pad, right? If he hits with that type of aggression sideways, I think it's too much. If he tries a different style, who knows, who knows? I don't know. What I do believe, I believe it's 4-0 LeBron.
Michael Todd: But I also believe, and I said this in the beginning of this, if he stops him one time, if Jerry sets his shoulder one time, even if it's not fully, if it's here, if he sets it and the match stops and LeBron thinks that he's going to hold on and pull through it, that's the only round it takes and then Jerry wins everything.
Michael Todd: okay because he will burn down right 100 because what happened is he will either foul out because i don't think he pulls through him or he will get his bicep stretched all the way out one round so two things happen there one once your bicep gets stretched out it's not as strong and two jerry just got so much confidence and you have a north american crowd screaming for him he's gonna feed off that energy and he'll win every round after that i just don't think we're gonna see it i think i think levon's gonna just go through it
Michael Todd: But if Jerry puts the brakes on him, you're going to see the most electric crowd you've ever seen in arm wrestling ever. And you're going to see some crazy stuff happen. I truly believe that. I mean, I just don't think we're going to get to see it because I think the strength gap is too much. I don't think the lane to beat LeVon is towards him.
Michael Todd: a lot of people think it is and it's a lot of them think that because how in the past gennady was able to beat him we saw how army's putting and army was going to pin him it was round five and six but he was going to pin him he was going to pin him round five don't get that twisted because we saw levon hit and his arms stretched back out and yeah he was going to pin him but the match was over he'd already won four zero so really it's irrelevant what was going to happen at that point but to compare that bent wrist press to jerry's bit risk press
Michael Todd: is naive. Levant, Ermes did not go forward to get that stop. He went backwards to get that stop. And then he gets the stop. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he gets the stop. Just watch the round three.
Host (possibly Malin): Round three, he did back pressure, and then he stopped him by protecting his pronator. And then did the transition, and then Levan, I think, fouled. And you and I both know the difference. And then in the restart, Ermes wanted to go directly there, and he got flushed. Yeah. That's the thing. It's just a different lane. Yeah, but just think that Jerry is a different kind of animal about this. Jerry is. Jerry is. I mean, Jerry's amazing. He's probably the best back pressure. I mean, like, Ermes is good. He stops the guy, and then he finishes that way.
Michael Todd: But, like, Ermes, I don't think anywhere near to Jerry about, like, a direct, you know. No, absolutely not. I'm closer to the Jerry than Ermes is with the direct hit, you know. And I just think it's a bad idea. Like, let me tell you, if I ever pull LeVon, and I do stop him the way Devon did round one, and he comes in with a press and my shorter lever than Devon, him being further on my side of the table, if he was unable to pin me and I was able to win,
Michael Todd: before four rounds are up i bet i would believe enough where i could press him you don't think i think i would bleed him enough over three rounds or three wins or if it's six rounds it took me six rounds to get three wins i'm flash pressing at some point because i'm gonna i'm gonna wear him out so much too much the thing is when i pull outside i'm wearing out my bicep my forearm my lats my hand my wrist everything that means all of this is still fresh so when you see me have these long crazy matches
Michael Todd: I'm only fatiguing these muscles. These are still fresh. So if you're on the opposite of me and you're fatiguing the same muscle groups that I'm fatiguing, then you're wide open for that press at some point. Like, it's coming. Because I'm going to time it and your arm's going to be shot, your hand's not going to be able to close, and I'm going to flash press you. I mean, if I win. I mean, if I bleed you enough. I don't know if it's something I can beat. I don't know. I mean, maybe at some point, because I have a closer range of motion, maybe at some point I'll be able to
Michael Todd: open with the press like come right out the gate with the press and beat some of the elite people i don't know um but it's so funny because people are like you need to do stricter form you need to do a closer angle i'm like guys i have a very short window to accomplish my goals i'm 51 years old i want to beat lavon i gave myself 24 months to do it i'm not going to be able to get this as strong as this in two years so okay why would i even focus on that when i should focus on making my strength stronger question if you beat
Host (possibly Malin): And you think that Levan is going to win against Jerry. This is your expectation. If I was a betting man, that's how I would bet. I definitely bet on me beating Ermes and I definitely bet on Levan beating him. If you beat Ermes in February, would you prefer to pull Levan in spring or end of the year? I'd rather get it done with. Let's do it. Let's do it in spring. Okay. Yeah. You want to do the next step?
Michael Todd: Levant, as long as you are healthy. Yeah, Devon thinks I should take some downtime and let my body rest and recover before I go after something big like that. I feel like I just take advantage of the momentum and just come back home, take a few weeks to just lightly train and get right back into prep. I'm a very focused individual and I need a goal. Three months between two events, yeah. Yeah, so I've done the math in my mind.
Michael Todd: from the date that we have chosen for East versus West 16 to what East versus West 17 could potentially be. And that particular date is one that's very, very special to me. So I won't say it just because people could figure out the math when the dates would be.
Michael Todd: But there's a possibility, and I know you know that I've already talked to Hot Springs Visitor Center and the Convention Center about possibly having that match. You know, if LeVon wins and if I win, pull LeVon right here in Hot Springs, Arkansas in a 5,500-person arena. So, I mean, it makes sense to me. I feel like it's already been written, man. I just feel like it's already been written. Yeah, yeah. I don't think that any of the next events
Host (possibly Malin): when your dates are exactly set, but time will show, yeah. Anyways, so, okay, let's go to another one. Brian versus Eddie. The thing is that the other day I was chatting with Travis, I think, and Neil was coming to the chat and he was saying, okay, Brian is very big and he may win, but Eddie is more technical. And then I didn't really follow a lot.
Host (possibly Malin): only remember when eddie and brian were pulling and to me eddie didn't seem like what he knew what he was doing while at least he had a cup brian at the cup and pinning him so i i judged by that but the other day i saw a video when eddie was just like moving and then wow eddie eddie really very smooth
Michael Todd: Very smooth. A lot. A lot. Yeah. So I worked with Eddie in 2022 at the Arnold Classic UK. We just got on a little bench and I pulled with him and showed him some back pressure and pronation. And it felt like he forgot all that when he was practicing with Brian at Brian's house. And then Neil got back with him and it's like it came right back to him and he's doing everything right. So my first initial thought was that Eddie might get hurt.
Michael Todd: that Eddie might get hurt pulling Brian because Brian has been practicing for like a year now. This short stint, this only five or six weeks training that Neil is having with Eddie could actually be an advantage because he doesn't have enough information to get confused on what to do.
Michael Todd: Brian has been training for a year now and he hears this and he hears this and he hears this and he might get confused trying to figure out which technique to work where Eddie's just got an outside top row that looks really good and impossible transition to a press, right? That might be the simpler outcome. So originally I thought Brian was a heavy favorite, heavy, heavy favorite. And now I think it's probably 60, 40 Brian. But I like both guys. And Eddie's hysterical. And the video that Eddie and Neil just did about the song
Michael Todd: I'm sure you watched that, right? The song that Neil and Eddie were doing when they were singing. Oh, God, it's hysterical. He made a video and released it a couple of days ago. And I know the song, they put their own words to this song, the music to the song, and it is hysterical. Oh, my God, it's so funny. Okay. I had John the other day also as a guest. And I said, John, would you pull Brian? And he said, yeah, but I would go inside.
Host (possibly Malin): with the leverage advantage Brian has and the strong hand, John said that he wouldn't really want to go outside with him. But you said that Eddie may just go outside and pick. Eddie, compared to Brian, he looks short, but he's not a short guy. He's a big guy. Probably as tall as you, probably. We're the same height. Yeah, yeah. But the only reason he looks small is because
Michael Todd: Brian is so big and well, he's six foot three and three hundred and fifty or sixty pounds of abs like he's jacked Yeah, I mean abs at 350 360, right? Well, the bronze just six eight and over 400 pounds That's just a different animal and we've seen six eight guys 400 pounds. I mean I
Michael Todd: what, Derek Smith, 6'8", been 370, 375, something like that. Brian's just built different. Like, he's a person who's built his frame through powerlifting and strength and a strongman, and he's just a different dude. I'm excited to have both of them in arm wrestling. I'm excited to see what comes next. Yeah, I'm very happy that they are interested. It just shows that we are growing and we are becoming better.
Host (possibly Malin): But if these guys like Leonidas, Kirill Sarchev, and Bryan, Larry, Eddie, if they are getting interested into arm wrestling, it just means one thing that we are on the right path. This is what I would do. So Phil Woody just dropped in the link to the YouTube video of Neil and Bryan. Yeah, I will find it. The Catabolic Click says that any chance of Scott Norton returning for one match?
Host (possibly Malin): I don't know. I invited Scott Norton to East vs. West 14, and he accepted the invitation. And then he had some issues that he, I don't know exactly what it is, but he said that like, he kind of said that he won't be able to come, but he was happy when I invited him. I hope, I hope we will see him, you know. Anyway, so let's go, let's go to do another one. Yeah.
Michael Todd: right so listen man um gabby was so close the first time but what barbara did to eckley was shocking and what egg lady to sarah after that one i mean yeah eric eckley did that to sarah before yeah yeah yeah then barbara did that to eckley after i was like oh my god what level is this chick at so you'd have to think the younger barbara has advanced more
Michael Todd: But I've never seen Gabby this thick. Like, she is so thick. And I'm like, this is when I saw her at East Florida 614. I says, is this size for Babura? She's like, yep. So I think she's been training nonstop since she lost to Babura. You know what I mean? Like, I almost, it's so crazy. It's so crazy. But I almost think Gabby might be the dark horse and going to win this thing. Like, I think she might be.
Host (possibly Malin): I mean, in my mind, she might even be the favorite. It's hard to bet against Rabora because Rabora is amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, Gabriela already proved herself. Oh, yeah. And we know how good she is. We just do not know how much Barbara progressed since that time. Absolutely. That's the biggest thing, right? Because she's young and she's just a massive human being. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so you are saying that
Host (possibly Malin): On the paper, Barbara may look favorite, but you have a feeling that Gabriela may be the favorite. I'm a Gabby fan anyway, though. I'm a fan of Gabby. Yeah. Okay. Let's go to another one. Pauline versus Krasimir. I'm going to be honest, man. I think Pauline's a 70-30 favorite, and I know most people aren't going to agree with that. Krasimir's like reigning world champ and just beat John and all that other stuff.
Michael Todd: I mean, Paul Lynn's dangerous. Paul Lynn has got a hunger and a fight inside of him that you rarely find in individuals. He's one of those guys that's special. Krazy, multi-time world champion, amazing athlete, phenomenal, very disciplined. I just think he's going to run into a stronger guy. That's what I think. I think Krazy's just going to run into a stronger human.
Host (possibly Malin): Hmm. Is that an impossible since it is best of seven? Do you think it's best of seven? It's six rounds, right? You're right. Okay, king of the table. I forgot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My bad. So whenever you think that it's not best of five and best of seven, who is his chances a little bit increasing? Krazy's got good endurance.
Michael Todd: So do you think that the 70-30 may go to the 60-40 or 65-35 just because it's best of seven? Yeah, he's got to pin him four times. We saw Paul take Sasho to the pad twice and this close to the pad for the third match. It would have won. That was three out of five. So he's got so much top end, he might gas if the matches are max effort. You know what I mean? So you're right. Maybe it does go 60-40 if you've got to pin him four times. But I still think Paul's a favorite.
Host (possibly Malin): I know that's crazy considering the resume that Krazy has. I honestly think that Paul is stronger. I don't want to talk so detailed, but I just think that winning WAF, the conditions and the professional things may be a little bit different. We understand. I know what you mean. Anyway, so when we, because you mentioned about the WAF and so I just like you. Anyway, so I just,
Host (possibly Malin): want to go to Sandris versus Rustam. We talked a little bit, but Rustam is the explosive one. Rustam is the... But do you remember Sandris versus Pablo? And Pablo is not known with his good endurance, but still Pablo is very strong. And he convincingly won first round against Sandris, as far as I remember. Is there any...
Host (possibly Malin): possibility that Sandri since best of seven stop, put a break, and then exhaust Rustam, or do you think that Rustam will dominate him? Or do you think Rustam may win? I think Rustam could win in a war, because Rustam's pulled eight-minute matches or something. Hadn't he pulled those long-ass matches before, like Zloty or something? I know Prudny did. Rustam pulled Brzezink for a while, Zloty. Yeah, but he wasn't that long, yeah. Okay. I don't remember Rustam.
Michael Todd: Rustam had some wars against Zolev in a Russian event, and I think Zolev ended up winning. Yeah, so I guess he does gas. I don't know. Sanders' long lever could put the fatigue on him, but I also think the short lever of Rustam makes it very difficult for Sanders. If Rustam sinks that hook, I think it makes it very difficult for Sanders to hang in there.
Michael Todd: So I'm saying 50-50. I honestly don't know. I can't guess. That's what makes it exciting. And it's definitely, look at this. We've got a 5'7 guy or 5'6 guy versus a 6'5 guy. That's funny. So let's go to Corey versus Tobias. I think Tobias is faster. But the lane that Corey goes, I think all that means is it's going to be a slip.
Michael Todd: in the strap i think corey's a stronger person it's just can he stop tobias's hit and tobias can hit in multiple angles like he can hit one way and then switch to another one real quick so on paper i would say tobias is a 55-45 favorite but i think cory's gonna win so someone asked a question just a minute ago and i'm gonna ask you now do you think that levon is the best ever
Host (possibly Malin): best arm wrestler we've ever had. Yeah, I agree. So if Jerry beats him, what does that mean about Jerry? Do you believe, do you believe that? Okay. The question, do you guys just please stop the religious, you know, argument, you know, just anyone who is focused on arm wrestling, please welcome. And please really just stop doing the another page, you know, um, do you think that
Host (possibly Malin): when we talk about the best guy ever, do we judge a person by his career? Or does it mean he must not lose at all? Is there anyone that has, I don't know, you know what I mean. There may be someone that may lose, but still may be more successful than other guys.
Host (possibly Malin): I mean, I cannot take anything away from Jerry. You understand? If he beats Levan. But I would more consider people with everything. Right. Yeah. Yeah, I think Levan's the best that's ever happened. The best arm wrestler we've ever seen. I truly think so. Strongest arm wrestler in the areas that you need to be strong.
Host (possibly Malin): So whoever does dethrone that guy doesn't make them, it makes them the current number one in the world, but it doesn't make them the best armwrestler ever. I mean, because, I mean, if you had like another 20 losses during your career, you know, it is very, very hard to do that. And best armwrestler, like you don't mean the gods, right? It is the strongest, like the strongest we've ever seen. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Host (possibly Malin): Okay. Who is that guy? Who's what? Who's the God? John Brzee. No, no, no. They, because some, some people are like my dog or something. Okay. Okay. If John is here, where is the closest guy? In my opinion, somewhere here.
Host (possibly Malin): In accomplishments, yes. Yes, in accomplishments. Michael, 90 kilo, 95 kilo guy for 30, 35 years pulling against a super heavyweight guy, just today, just show me a 90, 95 kilo guy that will be like, I will tell you something, like accept
Host (possibly Malin): Devon Bacho Saginashvili. I don't see today's super heavyweights are untouchable throughout all history. Like, I mean, they are very good, but there was some today that are more, more
Host (possibly Malin): It's the deepest of super heavyweights ever. Yeah, deepest, yes, no doubt. But I can show you, like, Bestow, Denis Diplenko, Bestow, Pushkar. I can tell you Bestow, maybe Richard Lapkus, you understand? Maybe Alan Carrera, Bestow. These guys would also do great against today's guys. No doubt. But just so John Bersing is like 90, 95 kilo guy, he's pulling against those guys that I mentioned, you understand?
Host (possibly Malin): And just today bring me Rustem or Irakli or Sasho that would be beating Alan Karev or Richard Lapkus or something. I mean, so what I'm just trying to say that we're talking about 90, 95 kilo guy killing everyone around his category and
Michael Todd: going head to head with the super heavyweights, sometimes winning, sometimes losing. Here's the thing. No one will never, ever duplicate what John did because he did it in an era that we don't have anymore. Too long time, Michael. Too long time. Yeah, it can never happen. It can never happen again. But I agree with you that when you say that LeJuan is the
Michael Todd: Strong the peak. I think he's the peak. I think he's the peak. The sport has ever seen. Now I think Richard love keys in his prime may have been strong as strong, but didn't have the technique that Lavon had. David some plank off may have been as strong, but didn't have the lever advantage of the height and size that Lavon has, you know, saying there Lavon is the peak in my opinion. But do you do you do you see like
Host (possibly Malin): Like in the history, like, do you think that like anyone could cause him problems? Okay. Okay. I'm talking about the past. Also, you are saying that I remember one, one, one year you were talking about 2012 or 13, 14, you were saying some year you, you started like you would beat everyone in the.
Michael Todd: I truly believe that that timeframe between 2011 and 2014, where I never lost a single round for over three years, and that's against Pushkar and 9-0 against Lubkees and Dave Chafee and Jerry Catarat and everyone that I arm wrestled in that timeframe, I believe that that version of me then, up to that point, could have beat anybody who's ever arm wrestled in a supermatch format.
Host (possibly Malin): Because at that time, with those rules, it was very difficult to beat me. Oh, okay, okay. You mean the... Yeah, I mean, I could full-blown Kings move. Some people think that you are still going under the table. I know. What's that about? Do you want me to explain or you want to explain the difference? Because some people, they are not toxic. They may not know, you understand? They don't know the thing.
Host (possibly Malin): uh i tried to explain again that like guys here is the the humerus bone so humerus bone is coming from shoulder to the elbow bone is going like this when this humerus bone is parallel to the floor it's it's okay uh in any any position but in the once this
Host (possibly Malin): humorous bone is down angle like this, down angle like this, at the neutral position, the beginning position of the match, and to anywhere to the losing position. If your humorous bone is down angle, that's a foul. If you are winning, it can go down, it's no problem. But in this, so Michael, as far as I saw, you were keeping it parallel, parallel.
Host (possibly Malin): Maybe one moment, maybe I suspected, I didn't watch it again, but suspected that maybe it went down during the Genadi match. But just this, I mean, I'm not sure about it. But what I'm just saying that there is the difference. Like, so you want to add anything so that maybe... Because people are asking, why are you allowing that? Like, listen, in the past, it was like this. It still was okay, you understand? So this is like this. So if your hand is coming down, it is...
Host (possibly Malin): possible it to come to the the pad you know so and I I mean I cannot do anything more than this this is the limit I always talk the same as if the shoulder is passing the center it is a foul this is going down here is foul so we have the limit so Michael is not pulling under the table so
Michael Todd: You won't say anything, just go ahead. That's just something that people started with and it stuck. And it's fun because people will say something, then someone will come to my defense. So I don't even talk about it anymore because on my platforms, someone will say something negative, somebody else will come by and be like, listen, he's not on the table, that's all, blah, blah, blah. It is what it is. I don't even care anymore. You set the rules, I'll arm wrestle within the rules. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that is nothing personal. I set the rules and I have never seen you to argue about it even one time.
Michael Todd: I don't see even you started to like pull about even when you pull against Jerry, right? Yeah, in 2019. I remember you didn't do anything. A lot of that was because I got so much hate for arm wrestling. I just was like, hey, I can. And now I was like, then I got hated anyway. And I'm like, I'm just going to get hated for winning. You're going to hate me no matter what. Just hate me for winning because that's what's going to happen. You are not going to.
Michael Todd: below no i mean like i said i just go within the rules where the rules are and the thing is because of the way that lot that parallel thing is set i could actually kick my body this way and i'm still in the same it's still the same thing like i'm still not below the pad but i'm creating that different angle right it's just within the rules i just arm wrestle within the rules you know people want to get mad about it don't like it it's ugly it's a bone lock
Michael Todd: The people that think it's a bone lock make me laugh because if you put my arm straight, I have to let up because I'm going to I'm going to if you straighten my arm straight as a go, I have to let up because I'm in an arm bar and it hurts. I don't have some tremendous amount of resistance to pain that if you put me an arm bar, I can just hold it. My tendons, ligaments and muscles, and obviously they reattach my biceps slightly closer. So that tendon ligament is just strong enough right before you get the bone that it can hold.
Michael Todd: If you push it far enough, you'll see me stand. Watch the two times Armory pins me. I stand up. Yeah, he made you stand up, right? He made you stand up. Yeah, he put so much pressure on my bone, I had to stand up. Like, oh, shit, you got me. You know what I'm saying? Because he pushed past my elastic limits in my tendon, ligaments, and muscles. He pushed it to the bone. I had to let up. But it's funny that people want to discredit and say it's a bone lock. It's not strength. Armory throws something. Except my challenge and show is not bone lock.
Michael Todd: Is it real, Ermes? Yeah, it probably is. It may not be, but it doesn't matter. You will find out soon, my friend, how strong my right arm is. Oh, Ermes. Ermes just came. I cannot invite Ermes. This is a YouTube type of podcast, so I can invite only one person. Like I said, man, he's a good dude. He's strong. He's an amazing athlete.
Michael Todd: I just hate it for him that he's got to face me to get to LeVon because he's going to have to wait a little bit longer to get to LeVon because I'm the one that's facing LeVon. Oh, okay. So you feel sorry for him? He's young. I don't feel sorry for him that he's young. I just feel sorry for him that I'm the obstacle he has to get through to get a shot at LeVon because he's not getting through me. Now, he's got plenty of time. He's 20 years my junior. He's 20 years younger than me.
Host (possibly Malin): Look at me. I'm still active at this age. I'm still getting better at this age. He's got plenty of time to become overall world number one. It's just not right now. So he's very unlucky, right? Very unlucky. Very unlucky. You heard that, Ermes? You are a very unlucky guy. You are a very unlucky guy. And Ermes...
Michael Todd: Basically, Michael is saying that, like, Ermes. He's laughing. He's got some good laughs going. All right, so let's get back to the matches. I love teasing him. I love teasing him. Yeah. Sanders, Rustam. Who do we have after that? We had Tobias, Tobias, and Corey. Yeah, we talked about this. Matt Mass, Marcio. Oh, yeah, that one, yeah. Matt Mass, Marcio. Historically...
Michael Todd: Matt Mask has been, you know, a horrible disadvantage for Marcio because the long leaver is both on our side and Matt's hand normally beats Marcio's hand. But from what I've seen, except for the Zornov, Jordan Zornov match, it looks like Marcio's in really good form. So... You mean this guy or you mean Petrenko? No, who's the guy? Jordan...
Michael Todd: Jordan Sonev. Sonev. That's what I meant. Sonev. Yeah. Except that match, Marcio looks really, really good. So I'm excited to see this match. Although historically Matt wins, I think it's 50-50. I think it's real close to where Marcio lives. It's pretty much his home state. It is his home state, Lansing, New Jersey. He's from New Jersey. I think he's going to have that hometown crowd, and I think it's going to play to his advantage. Okay. Lars and Lachlan. What do you think about Lars and Lachlan?
Host (possibly Malin): Listen, that is a very interesting match. And I see it 50-50. I mean, my opinion, Lachlan needs to be taking the center to this side and by controlling the pronator of
Host (possibly Malin): lars if he cannot if he just goes like this and the last push that shoulder it will be kind of hard to you know uh lift uh i mean you know the classic classic shoulder pressure you know what to do about that of course yours is different you're doing something that it doesn't work uh for us uh mortals
Michael Todd: Well, so let me tell you about Lars. I think his press is the most formidable asset that he has. It's phenomenal. But I think Lars is going to stop the match in an open top role. Oh, Lars. I have seen him doing this. And if you are saying this, you know something. Because you guys, I know very close. So, Lachlan, Lachlan, you hear that.
Host (possibly Malin): You hear that? If Michael is saying something, trust me, that is not opinion. That is information. Just listen carefully. This guy's asking, I think he's asked you a couple times how much I weigh. I weigh 300 pounds even this morning. So 296 is 130, so you are 132?
Michael Todd: Yeah, 1.30, 1.40, no, no, 1.40. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, I'm 1.90. I mean, I'm 1.36, 1.37, 1.36. 2.86 is 130, and then you have 14 pounds at 6, you're 136 here. Yeah, because 140 is 308. Yeah, 308, yeah, you're right, you're right, yeah. So I'm 1.36 and change. But like I said, I went to bed at 3.09.
Michael Todd: 309 underwear, whatever. 309. So I went to bed at 140.5. I mean, you're losing a lot of weight during the night. It's crazy. I had to pee like, I guess I'm old and I got to pee like 10 times a night. I don't know. It's crazy. Yeah. And we have another match. Sorry, buddy. You don't have to do it right now. Go ahead. What's the other match?
Host (possibly Malin): we have Kevin Palco and his opponent, I don't know, but John knows. I don't know the opponent either, but he looks strong. John says that the guy is very strong. He says that once he locks himself in hook, he said John is having a hard time to unlock himself. You're kidding me. This is what John said. Wow. Yeah, yeah. Palco's definitely going to go on a hook because that's where he likes to go. Okay, then I think we're going to have a war. That's going to be an exciting match then. I didn't know that. Yeah, Palco sinks that hook pretty solid. He's got an impressive arm. I saw the guy.
Michael Todd: Big forearm, you know, the Kevin Paltrow. Yeah, very big forearm. He's an impressive little dude, man. He's got a very impressive-looking arm. But, yeah, that's an exciting match, too. Rebecca, so we weren't going. Rebecca and I weren't going to go. Yeah, I heard that you were going. Robert told me. Yeah, I didn't want to miss training. I didn't want to mess up my training. And I'm actually going to miss one pronation lift and one set of –
Michael Todd: pronation gauge, back pressure, rise, all that. And then the second one that I would have missed, I'm just going to do the Monday. I get back home late Sunday. I'm doing Monday and then doing the next one on Tuesday. So instead of doing it on Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, I'm just going to do Wednesday, skip Friday, push Sunday to Monday. So I'm only going to miss one lift, but it's Rebecca's, Rebecca's birthday is December 30th. And she's like, you know, that'd be a fun birthday gift. Let's just go hang out with no stress. Like I have no stress. I'll go to the gym and compete. I'm going to go to the gym and train and just,
Host (possibly Malin): Do you know what you guys need to do? Find a room with a door lock and put an arm wrestling table there and you and Devon just go there, close the door and lock it and train it and get out and keep it quiet.
Michael Todd: I really want his help and or Auden's help on the setup and the strap. I know how to arm wrestle inside the strap. I just don't know how to get the best strap in the setup. I never practiced that stuff and a lot of times I didn't have the range of motion to do some of the stuff because I couldn't come back past here and I needed to come further. If those guys can teach me how to not give up so much in the setup, I think it would be a lot more different. I don't think you are giving up anything. You are an experienced guy. You can say that
Host (possibly Malin): I mean, at least, I mean, you are not gaining advantage, but I don't think you are giving up on anything, you know, like one is enough, you know, we don't want to owe you, okay? There you go, there you go. Anyways, Michael, my friend, it has been 70 minutes, one hour and 10 minutes. As always, it is a great pleasure, my friend. Yes, sir.
Michael Todd: Yeah, thank you very, very much. And Ermes will probably, after watching this, will fire you on social media. I'm sure he will. And you know what I'm going to do? Nothing. I'm just going to get back out there and keep training. I'm going to let him just keep doing all of his stuff and posting all of his challenges. And he's just trying to distract me from the work. He's just trying to distract me from the work that I got to do. I'm just going to keep doing the work. But you are also a little bit poking him, you know.
Michael Todd: I'm just telling you what I believe. I'm not saying anything that I think is any different. I've said nothing derogatory. I've said nothing inflammatory. I'm just telling you what I believe to be true. Yeah, and that's enough.
Michael Todd: Yeah, I've got one question for you. Remember this picture, this poster? Yeah, yeah. You asked me that, you know, if I would give you. Can you send me that back? I've lost it. I want to get that done for something else. Can you send me that image back? If I find it, yes. Yeah, because I can't find it. I was looking all through my emails. I couldn't find it. But why? You have it already. You want to do bigger? So, well, I have a partnership. I have a partnership coming up that I can't announce yet. And that image would look really cool on a collaborative banner.
Host (possibly Malin): Okay, that's good. That's good. Yeah. Anyways, once again, thank you, Michael. And thanks to everyone who has been watching us and wish you the best and healthy training. Yes, sir. Take care and God bless. And I'm sure I'll talk to you. But if I don't talk to you before Christmas, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays. I'll be blessed and take care and all that good stuff. Take care. Take care, brother. Bye bye.
