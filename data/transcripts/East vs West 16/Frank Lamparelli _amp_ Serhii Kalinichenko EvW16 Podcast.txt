SPEAKER_02: Hello, guys. You guys hear me? Yes. Hello, Frank. This is Inter. Okay, perfecto. Ciao, Engin. Ciao. How are you, my friend? Good. What are you doing there?
SPEAKER_02: Did you recently train or your arms are pumped originally like this when it is cold? I train and I'm in good form. Good form? Yeah, good form, yeah. Yeah, show me bicep. Yeah, not bad. Bigger than before for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So what is your weight, Frank? How many kilos?
SPEAKER_02: 117, 116. Wow. Yeah. And Kalina, Kalinischenko? I don't know. Today he wrote 118, but I don't know. I don't know. We will see. We will see in Tbilisi. Yeah, we are waiting for him to come and then
SPEAKER_03: Martino, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you, I can hear you. Great, great, because at some point there will be questions, but I won't understand them. Sure, I went to change my headphones because I put them in the washing machine and they still work. Great. But I see you big, Martino, I only see you now.
SPEAKER_02: It seems to me that until a fourth person enters, Zoom only shows you what he's talking about. Anyway, so we are waiting for Serhii to come and then we can start. But you can already tell us, are you in better shape than last time with Soviet East versus West? Are you in better shape than the last time we saw you fight?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, my shape is very good after the match with Dejah. I have changed the training system.
SPEAKER_03: Say it in Italian, Frank, if you want. I have a friend with whom we started working together 20 years ago. His name is Emanuele Pavarello. After many years of telling me to try a new type of training,
SPEAKER_03: And I wanted to listen to him and it's been about two months since I've been doing a training system that he made me do. This, in my opinion, is giving excellent results.
SPEAKER_00: So 20 years ago, Frank started arm wrestling with a friend of him. And his friend for all the time kept begging Frank, please try to train, as I say. And Frank finally listened to him. And it has been two months since Frank has been training according to the advice of this friend of him. And the results so far are pretty good.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so do we understand from what he said that he was only arm wrestling and now he's also actually training for the weights and other things? He asked you, did you only do table tennis before? How did you train? What was the difference? I did little table tennis and I trained, I did too long series with weights. Now I do a lot of isometry and
SPEAKER_03: I don't do much at the table. My last training session at the table was with Ermes Gasparini. It was a great training session. He's very strong. He's really strong. I think he'll win. I'm sure he'll win. He felt in great shape too.
SPEAKER_00: So he didn't really do that much table either before and after. But in his opinion, like his training sessions, series of training were too long. Now he has shifted things around. The last sparring on the table that he had was with Hermes. And he felt Hermes very, very good. And in his opinion, Hermes is in terrific shape and will win against Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_02: And Hermes as well, complimented his shape. Yeah, Hermes told me. He said that Frank is in very, very good shape. And what is this guy here with the Hawaii t-shirt and then with the red glasses? You don't remember this t-shirt? Oh, this is from Chen Zhou. Yes, I win this t-shirt. I remember, I remember. Yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And now you are going to pull against someone that would fit very well in that t-shirt, you know, with a smile and relaxed mode. Yes. Frank Lamparelli. Merry Christmas. Grinch. When you came to live a while ago, a few minutes ago, you showed your bicep. Can we see that again? No, go this way a little bit. Yeah, yeah. Do it again. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah that looks big yeah yeah um prank is asking your weight you said 118 today uh 118 today yes my you know i'm too fast to lose weight i have very good regime and now i have same power but i'm more more endurance have more big endurance i feel this
SPEAKER_04: Frank asks if you're weighting with both feet on the scale. Yeah, but you know, I'm not too much lose my biceps or forearms. Only one centimeters biceps and only one centimeters forearms. And that's only water, right? Yeah. And you really didn't lose any power? Uh, okay.
SPEAKER_04: uh i am grow my wrist plus 10 kilograms oh you gain power okay yes you are in trouble my friend and uh i have progress with my fingers uh i have a big big muscle group i have 65 kilograms with the eccentric eccentric candle
SPEAKER_04: Okay, but how about big muscle groups like bicep? No, I don't train biceps. You don't train biceps? Maybe last my training biceps is three years ago and bench press maybe three years ago. I don't train. I work only in table. Wow, that's interesting. What do you think, Frank? Did you understand what he says, Frank?
SPEAKER_00: Frank never trained his wrist, so what can he say? You like Sweetko, Giorgi Sweetko. He said for me, he never trained pronation.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but at the table he trains. Listen, the pronation doesn't only train with the weight. When somebody is holding you, you do this. Still training here. I'm not saying he's not training or he's training, but it is possible to train. If you have good partner, it's possible to train at the table. You guys have something in common.
SPEAKER_02: What? You guys have something in common. You both lost against Georgi Swetko. Yeah. Which one? Frank, which one gave better match to Swetko? You or Serhii? Me. You? We will see soon.
SPEAKER_03: I saw the match. Karin Ischenko was very good with Svetko. A lot of resistance. He was very fast, especially in the starts. Giorgi was put in a lot of trouble. It was a really good match.
SPEAKER_00: Frank said it was a very good match. He watched closely and Kalinichenko surprised him with his endurance, his speed in entering the press, and also to give that much fight to Georgy Tvetkov is not easy, though. Thank you, Frank. Thank you. And my friend Andrea reminded me that you also both beat Matt Mask.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. And who beat Mask more convincingly? I think, of course, me, because... I think both were battles, you know, like very close match. I win easy three rounds. Maybe I pulled Esther Susvest, I win three rounds easy and... Yeah, but Serhii, when you go to a competition,
SPEAKER_04: and when you know that you need to win four times yeah train for that yeah yeah yeah of course uh i think we had we have this uh
SPEAKER_02: uh this frank same same uh same power maybe you know yeah the thing is that i think matt top roll you and you have to pull this way some rounds while frank top roll matt and matt had to pull that yes so do you do you think that he do you expect frank to top roll your wrist uh you said that your wrist is thank you the stronger now
SPEAKER_04: Yes. Do you know, I pulled a long time, a lot of time, maybe one more year ago with Matt Musk. Yeah. And I think I have very good progress in last year. And I'm not saying I pulled with Matt Musk after my fight, maybe after six months. And
SPEAKER_04: don't feel him in right arm you know you mean you mean in training yes in training in training yes yes of course in training and of course i grow my power and i'm only start i'm going to start progress and because i am come back three years ago after my injury and i feel it's possible for me
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. Maybe I have now only 70% of my potential. Okay. Okay. And Frank is old and no more growth for him, right? No more progress. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Frank, I put, I put the word into his mouth and now it looks like he told you, he said that he is progressing while you are old and you are not progressing. In fact, it was my word just, just to start, you know, steering the port, you know,
SPEAKER_00: So Frank is like wine. The more you let him rest inside the bottle, the better he becomes. And maybe also a bit stronger. And Frank, are you going to top roll this guy? He doesn't have any technique.
SPEAKER_02: for him on the top roll and uh or top roll or nothing yes only that so that is what we will do yeah and then will you be able to take his wrist to franco or to kalina no i'm asking frank well what does he get the chances that he will topple terry take his wrist
SPEAKER_03: What percentage do you have of top rolling? I don't know. I will try in all ways to block him and try to top roll him certainly. I hope I can't underestimate him because he's very fast and definitely faster than me. And then he's also a great presister.
SPEAKER_04: he will try he doesn't know the chances and he has to be careful because the kalinchenko is faster than him and also a very good presser okay so he believes that most likely he's gonna take his wrist but he needs to be careful that said he can go with the dead wrist but i don't have planning pulled with him uh flop press because uh i think it's my problem with georgie sweetko
SPEAKER_04: It's because he's too strong a top roller. And maybe you remember when I pulled with Riffartem, I broke my pinky fingers. And maybe only now I come back to my power with low fingers, you know, like control here. Because before my preparation with Sitco, I had every exercise progress only
SPEAKER_04: uh don't have progress with my fingers uh with my low fingers with this movement because maybe you see my fingers little change and it's like problem with tendons and now i'm come back what i have before this fight uh in fight with the same power same power yes say more stronger more stronger the question is
SPEAKER_04: you said that now is ready and you don't plan this so what does it mean you can hook him or you can top roll him or you can side press him oh you will top roll friend yes for me it's my best technique and i think i have very good top roll and uh i think i am come back my my my really best shape is when i pulled with the reefer 10
SPEAKER_02: You are very big and huge. Yeah, I am very big and huge, but now I have a very good diet. And I lose my fat, but my power grows, really grows. And Frank, what is the possibility for him to top-roll you? What do you think are his chances to take your risk?
SPEAKER_00: He's asking you what are the possibilities that toproll you and before Kalinchenko said that he broke his finger and then with Svett as a partner he couldn't control it well. Now he healed him and so he finally thinks that his hand has returned to its best form. And Enghent asked you precisely what are the possibilities of toprolling you. There are few people who have managed to beat me in toproll. But no one has ever managed to open the wrist.
SPEAKER_00: So I don't know if he'll be able to open the post. He might be able to beat me in toproll, but not open the post. So Frank is saying that some people, it's rare, but some people were able to beat him with toproll, but nobody was ever able to open his wrist. So he says that Kalinchenko has zero chances of opening his wrist.
SPEAKER_02: oh hey did you hear that yeah yeah yeah yeah you have to confirm it you are the encyclopedia of arm wrestling did Frank ever lose his wrist I will be first who will open you for your wrist it's 100 percent um Frank don't you think that your wrist was a little bit like this when he pulled against a sweat coat
SPEAKER_03: Frankie is saying that he did it on purpose because it was to better access his side pressure and try to press Zlatko. Okay, for example, I lose my wrist
SPEAKER_04: okay maybe maybe it's happened everything happened i am little lose my wrist and i after come to my shoulders and i have more stronger from press like that kefi and i press you what you do what can you do when i when i press you only three minutes ago you said you don't plan to do that no no no i i i say for for example for example what he will do
SPEAKER_02: When he opened my wrist. It's not possible. It's not possible. Yes, press me. I stay like this. Do you think that your press is as strong as Dave Sheffy's press? Yeah, I think 100%. 100% it's my press stronger. I don't know. Dave Sheffy even pressed Laletin like this. Can you press Laletin? I don't pull with Laletin. I don't know. But no, what I'm just saying, you said yours is stronger than Dave's. And Dave was able to do that to Laletin. Do you think you can do it too?
SPEAKER_04: What do you think about flop press power? Kamil Jablonski, left arm. Incredible. And you remember he pulled with Dave Chaffee? Yeah, right arm. But I don't feel...
SPEAKER_04: I don't feel Camille's right arm. Camille teach me how to train flock press. My right arm is more stronger than Camille's right arm.
SPEAKER_04: in flop press. Left arm, of course, Kamil left arm, it's maybe 20% stronger. How do you know that your flop press is stronger than Kamil's right arm? Did you do the training? I know how many kilograms he trained with right arm. Oh, you do more than that? We have same exercise because he give for me this exercise and I know how many kilograms he trained. Frank, he says that he can do even more than Kamil does. So are you in trouble?
SPEAKER_00: But I have questions. Ask this friend. What he do when I stay in this position?
SPEAKER_00: He said that first he will pray the Lord and secondly he can't say everything. He has to keep some secrets for the show. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay, you have nothing. You say I have nothing? Okay, it's secret. I have nothing for this. Listen, listen, what I did, what I did, I wrote to Kamil Jablonski, I said, Serhii says that his right arm press is stronger than yours. And then he put like laughing, you know.
SPEAKER_02: with with just crying and laughing you know so hard so yeah so he said that he doesn't have any answer for you but so he doesn't agree with you he he he my teacher he my teacher teacher yes for first teacher okay okay
SPEAKER_02: Okay, do you realize that, you know, Frank's arms get bigger and then Frank is trying to intimidate you, you know, with those arms, you know. Frank, how many kilograms, you know? 160, 170. Okay. Yeah. Very good. Very good. Yeah. Anyway, so.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Kamil wanted to join, but this is probably we would like to talk, you know, together. Okay. So, Serhii, you are one second. This guy. Kamil. Kamil. This guy says his right arm press stronger than yours. Answer him. Answer me. They are gay? Yeah. Serhii Kalinchenko.
SPEAKER_02: My friend, I am watching you and you have a long way to get me. So I am sorry to disappoint you, but not really. You are far away, Sergei. Okay, but you show me exercise for flop press.
SPEAKER_04: before and you say how many kilograms you press and how many kilograms i press and you say for me your left only before when we meet only your left arm have 20 kilograms more but right now but sergey do you remember when this was two years ago no two years it's one years ago i i don't pull two years ago
SPEAKER_02: i have training and my power is going up all the time and now it's good it's good but uh when you pulled with dave chafee yes yes this was beginning and now yes you're pushing kilos that's warm up for me maybe maybe now it's warm up but before uh i need your results what you have before coming who is winning uh frank or 30
SPEAKER_02: I think Frank have a very big chance to beat Sergey because his hand is big trouble. Sergey fight with the hand and if he will lose the hand he will don't have the press what I have. I'm sorry. Do you think he cannot press Frank? Oh look at the bicep. What's your weight?
SPEAKER_02: I'm not so big now because I was sick almost 10 days, 9 days and I lost a lot. Show the bicep again. Show the bicep again. That looks big. Amazing. Amazing. Yeah. Amazing. It is almost as big as Frank's bicep. Almost. How many centimeters does he have biceps?
SPEAKER_02: Serhii is asking how big is your bicep? 52, fully pumped. Pumped? Yeah. 52, pumped. Frank says that his bicep is 54. By the way, can you beat Jerry Cadourette?
SPEAKER_02: Of course I can. I asked this to Jerry. Jerry was just laughing. Jerry said that I beat the king of Poland. He said, who is coming? No, he make big mistake. He don't understand what is the king of the Poland. He will understand soon. Okay, who is the king of the Poland? I am the king. Right arm or left arm?
SPEAKER_02: I am the king. Right arm or left arm? Any arms. Any arm, any arm. Any arms. Okay, okay. Let me concentrate these two gentlemen. They will pull in Tbilisi and see you later, my friend. And take care of yourself. Yeah? Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye. Yeah. I offer them a match. Jerry and Kamil.
SPEAKER_02: Who do you guys think would win? Maybe we will see new arm wrestling technique. From who? From flop to flop. Who's winning? Frank, who's winning? Jerry or right arm? For me, Kamil. Right arm coming will beat Jerry? Wow. I think Jerry.
SPEAKER_04: I think right arm Jerry. Maybe really Camille have now more stronger right arm. But I'm pulled with Camille in qualifier and after every meeting we pulled with him right arm. And maybe he now really more stronger. Yeah. He said yes, he had big progress. Maybe okay. But for my opinion, of course, Jerry have more big chance to win.
SPEAKER_02: So you think that Jerry is going to win and Frank is thinking that Kamil is going to win. That's interesting. We will see. And do you think that the winner will be the best club press in the world?
SPEAKER_04: yes i mean who is stronger than jerry's press i don't know yes i think it's yeah two guys who have best flock press in the world but camille have left jerry have right ah coming no that's so strong not bad no not bad yes not bad of course more we maybe 10 weak yes but not
SPEAKER_02: We'll see, we'll see. Frank, do you make your plans strategy against Serhii only to beat the Floppers? Listen, you said Serhii, top role chance, you said zero.
SPEAKER_02: so so where is he gonna go he's gonna hook you or like what is your game plan game plan i haven't i haven't hooked i know i know i know so i will try to top roll him okay you said his chance is zero to top roll you how about his chance to hook you
SPEAKER_03: But I'm also good at stopping the hook. You have to look at the table. Let's see who's faster. He's saying that he's pretty good at stopping hooking people as well. And we will see at the table who's faster. So you are just saying that Terhi will be like this. Right, Frank? This is what you are saying.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that this is all a kind way to say that Kalinicenko will end up with his wrist gone. He knows that Enghili likes to provoke, he wants you to do a bit of poison here. No, I consider him very strong. I think we'll have equal chances. We'll have to play it out. We'll see. I feel in shape.
SPEAKER_00: Frank said that Kalinchenko is a very strong opponent and he truly sees their chances as like a good match. Like always it's not easy to decide who's going to win and he's feeling good shape and so he will stake everything on his top role.
SPEAKER_02: And Serhii, you said you're going to top roll that guy. And what is your chance using that to top roll that guy? And why did you ask him what he will do if you do this? Do you think there is a possibility for that? I think my technique, my top roll technique, it's counter technique for Frank.
SPEAKER_04: because I don't have technique when I too much pull with my back pressure. I don't need too much cupping. It's like I'm little pronate.
SPEAKER_04: and side yes i'm like back pressure little pronate and side i'm never never never pull like hermes gasparini or other guy it's not not my style top roll and yours is more hand control you are saying yes yes yes yes and how how how do you think uh frank's hand control
SPEAKER_04: is also very good yes he have he have very good control because i saw to fight with uh sweet coal see very good top roll him after uh fight with matt musk very good top roll fight with i think when he pulled with the uh with michael todd
SPEAKER_04: He had a chance to win this match. He had a chance to win this match. And fight before with Dave Chaffee. Round three, you know, it's like... Yeah, yeah, round three. Round three. And maybe he don't ready for... He opened for him wrist, for Dave wrist. Maybe he more...
SPEAKER_04: I just know more motivate win and he more control side. And I think it is different, you know, like Frank is heavyweight while Dave is super heavyweight category guy. Yeah. Oh, yeah. He was he was. And he was. But it's interesting because he opened for Dave Chaffee wrist. Yeah. It's very good. It's very good results. And of course, I have a maximum good preparation.
SPEAKER_04: to Frank because my plan is not to win this match with Frank. My plan will go to belt, will have match with Rina Masic or other guys who after have belt and I hope Devon Larratt after back to 115 and I will pull with Devon Larratt.
SPEAKER_04: I will kill him. You will kill him? Of course I will kill him. He very, very bad person in table. And I show him who really bad person in table. He not, what is it? He dirty mouse too much speak with my friend Petrenko Oleh and I wanna kill this guy in table. Yeah, I have...
SPEAKER_00: Don't you think that he is also a very dangerous opponent? Frank said that he has to go in the row because there are so many people that want to pull with him.
SPEAKER_00: with Devon right now. Frank, did you understand everything before he translated you to flight? Yes, he wanted to shoot with Devo Larratt later, or with Numatic. Yes, yes. And Frank, how do you see your chances in 115kg? What is your main target? Do you also want to win the title? What is your goal at 115kg? Do you want to win the title? What are your next matches and goals?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I would like to, yes. Who wouldn't like to win the title? I'm getting ready for that. I would also like to, I've always said, I would like to do a match with Devon Larratt, also because I'm the only one who never claimed when someone beat Maski. Because all those who beat Maski, he claimed them. He claimed it, except with me. And it's also impossible for him to take it with you. Even Maski started laughing with you.
SPEAKER_00: So Frank said of course he wants to win the belt like who wouldn't want to be the the number one so he's training um he will see if can climb the ladder and he also would like to put with Devon because he said that Devon avenged every Matt mask lost but not the one against Frank so
SPEAKER_00: Devon never pulled within and Devon pulled with every people that beat him. And how does he seize his chances against him? Against Devon or against Kalinchenko? No, Devon, Kalinchenko. How would you see a match against Devon? What would your chances be? Well, winning a match would be a dream, but I think it would be a great challenge because he has a top role that I would really like to beat.
SPEAKER_00: So he's saying that Devon has a style of top rolling that Frank thinks he can do pretty well against it. And for winning even the first round would be a dream. And in his opinion, it would be like a very interesting match. And he would plan to go the same way as he did against Michael Todd. So keep climbing and keep pronating. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Serhii, which one is your favorite match other than your match in the Tbilisi event? My favorite match? I think it's Morozov versus Laletin. Morozov versus Laletin.
SPEAKER_04: uh 80 uh 95 kilograms uh betkili and alex jok because it's uh no betkili not alex jok because it's uh it's title match and uh petrenko my friend of course and uh i hope he will win but it will be too hard much 100
SPEAKER_02: will be a very tough match yeah very very much and uh uh lalitin and morozo for me interesting because it's of course super heavyweight category belt super heavyweight match morozo morozo hasn't lost any match with left arm so far and now did you see his last picture on his story when he's like yes yeah i mean i never seen him that big you know before he crazy he crazy and also lalitin is big how do you see the match
SPEAKER_02: Uh, I think everybody, every professional arm wrestling think about, uh, same, my opinion it's, uh, or Lali can win fast or win Morozov. So you are saying that if Morozov stop that match, he will win. Yes. Yes. So that is that easy either boom or stop and then, you know, Morozov wins, but in which way Morozov can win that risk or he can hook him or.
SPEAKER_02: He came with the pronation side pressure. How do you see that Morozov winning? Or do you think Morozov can top roll? I think no. Top roll, Morozov maybe...
SPEAKER_04: not win but I think he stopped him with little loose wrist and with this position and has a little bit pronated yes and uh control control control control control and uh one round second round maybe same situation and uh
SPEAKER_02: Third round, I think it's maybe key to go to this and after maybe hook, I don't know. You are saying if Morozov can stop? Yes, but I don't see any rounds when he wins the pro. Okay, the question is, what is the chance that Morozov will stop Laletin? What is the chance that Laletin is just going to flash pin him?
SPEAKER_02: Uh, it's go to flop press. No, no. What I'm just saying that how many percent chance you think will flash or, or Morozov will stop? What is the possibility that Morozov will stop that match?
SPEAKER_04: Okay, okay. I think 80% Morozov can stop like it. Are you serious? Yes, you're serious 80% can stop because it's left arm. And Morozov stop everybody, everybody who and who open his stuff, everybody stop.
SPEAKER_02: and i think it will happen with i think it will happen and i hope it will happen when did when did morozov lose his wrist and stop someone with left arm i don't remember who did he like his match with matushenko was hook
SPEAKER_02: yeah it's it's like maybe maybe with dave chaffee maybe with dave chaffee no no no no no it's right now yeah yeah so you are saying 80 80 is gonna stop him yes and and while we talk about this match frank how do you see uh la latin versus morozov left turn uh permission 50 50.
SPEAKER_03: Morozov has a very strong wrist, he has a very strong pronation and he has a monstrous bicipite. Lalletin, however, has a longer lever and he is also very strong in pronation. In my opinion, it will really be a match where they will win fast. In my opinion, everything will be very combative.
SPEAKER_00: So Frank is saying that Morozov has a very strong wrist, a very strong pronation, and a wicked strong bicep. And Lalitin, of course, has a longer lever, a strong pronation as well. And he thinks that it will be a war, and he doesn't see someone clashing the other guy super easy. Not all the rounds, at least. Okay, so he thinks it will be a competitive match. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And if the match is competitive, can Lallatin win a match that is stopped? He's saying that Lallatin with the straps might have better endurance.
SPEAKER_02: Better than his right or better than Morozov? Better than Morozov. Oh, better than Morozov. Okay. Okay. Probably depends on the position. Yeah, yeah. Which position? And start. And start, yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah, when the match stopped against Kamil, his endurance wasn't really there, but he explosively pinned Kamil, but not in a battle, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Let's talk about Devon vs Gennady Kalnichenko. I think Devon has more big chance to win. Because in the last fight, I think Devon lost only because he played too much.
SPEAKER_04: and he lose and now he have more good form like before but but quick vina and try only come back power what he had before and i think devon larat will win but i hope
SPEAKER_04: I hope, I hope, really hope Kvikvinia will do something and change this and win.
SPEAKER_04: I hope maybe I made a mistake because I want to see Quiquinha win. So you are saying that your heart is with Quiquinha, your mind is with Devon? Yes. I understand. And Frank? For me, Quiquinha, he played at home.
SPEAKER_03: He must win and I wish he would win. Why do you wish? Because he is your old friend from WAF? Yes, and because Devon can't always win.
SPEAKER_02: So you are saying that Devon is winning, so maybe sometimes he needs to lose. That's what you are saying. Okay, the question then. When Lewand and Devon pulled, who did you support? You said that Devon cannot win always. Now Lewand always wins, but you still want him to win.
SPEAKER_02: So there must be some different answer for that one, but let's not go there. So you want Gennady to win, but what does your mind say? Gennady. Gennady, your mind, yeah? Yeah, the part that, you know, like... He's very motivated. He's very Gennady. Yeah, yes, he is at home. Motivation will be 100%. But do you think his bicep will be 100% after surgery?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I've seen Gennady's last training sessions and I see him in shape. For me, he recovered 80% of the problem he had in his arm. And in my opinion, it will be a surprise. Do you think he will also sweat the press, so everything in the arm? No, no, also in the press.
SPEAKER_00: So he's saying that watching latest Gennady training, he thinks that Gennady recovered around 80% of his former shape. But at the same time, Gennady has not only the hook option, but his press is also very dangerous. Michael Todd has done a very long press, and if he had done the same press with Devon now, he would have beaten him.
SPEAKER_00: I'm saying that against Michael Todd, he was able to press for a very long time. But Michael Todd's ability to resist the press is better than Devon's ability to resist the press. And if that Gennady was just the pressing part against the current Devon, he thinks that that press would have been enough to pin Devon.
SPEAKER_02: I understand, but you know, because Michael's open arm, the guy is like possible to allow at least to pressure. But Devon, when he's especially big and strong, he's strong at the center as well. Like Michael, like Devon can pull close as well, while Michael is usually going up like open like this, you know? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: to prevent Devon from starting in this position and to be faster. He's saying that you cannot let Devon start in that position and you have to be faster and you have to be smarter. Okay. Yeah, whenever he said that he thinks his bicep is 80%, that is the thing that, you know, like I'm thinking, can you be 80% or one muscle group? Because last time the match was very, very close. Very, very close. And now...
SPEAKER_02: Devon is, my guess, at least as strong as last time. He may be even bigger and stronger, but time will show. And I mean, if Gennady is in his best shape, physical shape, home advantage, he will be crazy. Then I would just say like, boom. Now, all I know
SPEAKER_02: that like he had a surgery and which I don't know is that how much he recovers if just just you guys remember one round that Devon was on his arm and Gennady just bring his you know arm like this can he still hold on if he can hold on there then that we will see an incredible match yeah I don't know what for you who win for me
SPEAKER_02: For me, listen, listen. Normally, because I'm organized, I don't say. But I said this to Gennady. I think that I said Devon is a little bit favorite. And Gennady said, no, no way. It's impossible. So Gennady here and here ready. If Bicep is ready, very dangerous Gennady. If Bicep is not ready... Gennady is ready, yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Time will show. Yeah. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_03: Let's go. Michael versus Hermes. Hermes. I am good with Hermes and he is very, very strong. Very, very strong.
SPEAKER_03: Michael Tottenhouse is in good shape and has 20 kilograms. Bigger? Yeah. Hermes has good resistance. For me, win Hermes. Is it because he is Italian or it is your objective opinion?
SPEAKER_02: Objective opinion. Okay, I believe you. And Sebi? It's impossible. He's a very, very strong ambassador. Very strong? Okay, okay, Frank. You think Hermes is going to win. Show us how Hermes is going to win. How? Like, technical, you know. Okay, ready? Go. And you are Hermes. Show me how he wins. Boom. And? No, you don't win here.
SPEAKER_02: You need to bring it down. How do you bring it? I don't know. Listen, listen. Does he bring with top row or does he bring with the shoulder pressure?
SPEAKER_03: In my opinion he will use the same technique that he did many years ago when he had the match in Italy and yet he has improved a lot in the top roll and also in the press. So in my opinion when Hermes manages to change from top roll to press in a moment in my opinion
SPEAKER_00: So he thinks that the answer is pretty clear. Everyone that wants to see what Hermes will do can just go and check their latest match. The only difference is that Hermes is stronger, like so much stronger, both in the top row, but also in the press, because at that time his press wasn't like he didn't use the press as much as he did today. So Hermes is very, very technical and very, very good at switching between top row and press.
SPEAKER_00: He says that maybe Hermes would be able to just to probably just press, but Hermes is way better than him and just keep changing and attacking where Michael is not ready at the point. So like the last match, but with Hermes so much stronger. Yeah, but does he think that Michael is now stronger than that time?
SPEAKER_03: Do you think Michael is stronger than then and that in the sense that they have become equally strong or one of the two has managed to become stronger in proportion? Looking at the match I did years ago with Michael and that of Hermes many years ago, Michael Todd has changed a bit his move. It has changed, it has improved a lot too. Then now it has taken over and I don't know if it will be much, much stronger.
SPEAKER_03: and having taken 20 more kilos, but it has improved.
SPEAKER_00: So he's saying that of course Michael Todd improved and of course it improved as well since last time he pulled because he gained 20 kilograms more. And also his Kings move changed compared to the last time he faced him like years and years ago. And he said that Michael Todd for sure improved and also it became better at utilizing the Kings move and keep his wrist. But he doesn't think it is the same as Hermes and doesn't think it is enough to win the match. Thank you.
SPEAKER_04: I think Hermes will win. It's maybe 85% I give for Hermes. And for my opinion, he has two very good techniques for winning this match. First is top row.
SPEAKER_04: and he have press but not with loser wrist with this wrist okay like to probe him uh to i don't know maybe 20 percent here stop and after push him like this it's my first pin and second do you remember fight with with jerry with jerry
SPEAKER_04: he trained a lot this moon yeah yeah and i think it's very will very work with uh it's michael
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you think he can do this to Michael Todd? Yes, I think yes. I mean, to me, that part to control his pronator with the wrist, like he did with Jerry. I mean, Jerry is coming to you, so he's giving his pronator to you while Michael is going
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but Hermes, I saw Hermes a lot, I saw training Hermes, and he a lot trained like with Handel, like this, you know, not for here, for this line more. Yeah, but why do you think that Hermes lost his wrist against Devon?
SPEAKER_04: I think Hermes, because Hermes don't have zero round, Hermes have grip. He grip like this. Oh, he had a bad grip? Yes, he had very, very bad grip with Deon Larratt. He stay like this open fingers and Deon Larratt mentally destroy Hermes.
SPEAKER_04: Hermes don't want to pull second round. When Hermes come to second round, Hermes stay like this. Okay, you do what you want. I don't want to pull with you. I don't like you, you know. And Hermes
SPEAKER_04: Don't want to pull and don't do nothing because for him it's really, really bullshit what say Devon, what do Devon. And only because Devon win. Do you think on that day Devon wasn't stronger? Yes, 100%. He was not? Yes, 100%. When Hermes pulled with Devon, Hermes stronger.
SPEAKER_04: think i don't know i don't know okay okay in my part i think 100 100 you know it's like uh when when pulled uh petrenko with them in the first round petrenko don't wanna i don't know
SPEAKER_04: Even for listen what say Devon, too much speaking, too much trash talk, too much everything. And everybody in arm wrestling, I don't know, everybody in arm wrestling when he pulled the table,
SPEAKER_04: everybody very good speak, you know, you have injury, okay, okay, like very friendly sport, you know, only Devon kill everybody. I like Devon because he like, everybody love fight with Devon. But other sportsmen not ready for this need more stronger brain.
SPEAKER_04: So you are saying that Devon doesn't have a stronger brain? Before? No, now I think he will reign. Only Quiquinha have fire brain when Devon doesn't matter what he say, Quiquinha stay more stronger. Quiquinha stay more stronger, you know? And you were saying something, Frank? What were you saying?
SPEAKER_03: Frank, go ahead. What did he say? I didn't get the question. He said you were talking. What did you want to say about the fact that Kalinicinco said Devon was stronger than Frank? First of all, Hermes lost on a psychological level, because Devon is such a friend outside, and then on the table he upsets you, he tries to disorient you with words.
SPEAKER_03: When you lose concentration for a moment and lose the first shot, then it's done. So he's a champion on the table, but on a psychological level, no one beats him. He manages to demolish you at that level. For example, I with Musk.
SPEAKER_03: So Frankie is saying that it is true that Lebon is a master, not only at the table, but also, as Kalinchenko said, in the psychological warfare. And the pressure is very real, for example, against Matt Musk.
SPEAKER_00: knowing that Matt Mask is a very violent person at the table and to not feel intimidated, Frank, his strategy was to only wash the knuckles of Matt Mask and never allow Matt Mask's words to reach him. And he thinks that when Hermes lost the first round,
SPEAKER_00: Going back to the table, being defeated psychologically was a huge blow and the first thing that Hermes lost was the psychological warfare because Devon is very kind to the table but then when you meet him it is the opposite and it is real, the psychological pressure is real. And would Frank's psychology handle that? Would you be able to resist Devon psychologically?
SPEAKER_00: For me, whatever Devon says is just gibberish to him. He doesn't listen to anybody at the table, so Devon can do whatever he wants. He will keep smiling. He will be smiling? Wow.
SPEAKER_04: yeah but it's true it's true it's really true nobody understand this moment uh you know like when pulled when rms professional sportsmen have a lot to fight before in life and when he come to table
SPEAKER_04: too much pressure, mental pressure, and he don't want to vote. But it's a mess. It's not like guys who first time come to table. It's really guys who have stronger brain. But Devon Laurent, for Devon Laurent, possibility destroy your brain, destroy your motivation, destroy everything. Because he every time after conference come for you and, my friend, how are you? I'm your friend.
SPEAKER_04: i am your friend i am friend you yes okay okay okay but you have inside something like not good feeling but he smiled because he safer it's only for trash talk but he's he's smart he very smart he's very smart it's it's work it's work and what everybody did he said double lara to the fox
SPEAKER_04: Fox, yes, yes, he Fox, he Fox. And this work, his work when Hermes, I don't know, like fish, like, like, like fishing, you know, Hermes is fish, Devon Larratt. Same Conor McGregor, McGregor is the same. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, but,
SPEAKER_02: I love Devin Larratt, but well, he pulled not with my friend. Yeah, I mean, that is the case. Usually, you know, I also I mean, it doesn't mean that I need to be disrespectful, but I don't feel like, you know, you are my friend or something. Now you are there to fight, you know? I mean, yeah. I mean, yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, you can't really think that, you know, this is my friend and, you know, this and that.
SPEAKER_02: please 30 minutes no friendship you know and then later again yeah yeah we are friends again yeah yeah but it's normal it's normal in sports mentality war it's it's normal in arm wrestling soon everybody understand this and start to do this i don't know i don't know if there is anyone they can do what devon is doing but yeah not like devon yeah yeah anyway so
SPEAKER_02: I would think for myself, I would think that it would take energy from me if I would try to do such thing, because I'm more focused on, you know, like holding the guy and bringing to the pad, you know, if I start talking, talking this and that, that I can't really concentrate, you know, this is...
SPEAKER_02: But that is also sometimes like a Russian roulette. You talk, and if the guy doesn't care, then it's a problem. Now the pistol is turning to you, like Gennady case on the first match. Gennady didn't really care so much, so it didn't really work.
SPEAKER_02: But let's see how it will be this time. Okay, I did another program before you guys with Neil Pickup. So this is two programs in a row. And so I would like to ask you guys lastly, Tata Chinks versus Irakli Zrakashvili. Irakli. Irakli? Yeah. Any detail, analyzing?
SPEAKER_04: In my opinion, three-time top-roll win. I think this. Because maybe the Todd Hutchins top match is finished for Irakli. So you are saying that Irakli is going to beat him three times? Yes. And then how about the title match? You need to win four times. Four times. I think too much stronger Irakli now.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yes i think he never do you think that it is possible to beat um tatashins without controlling his pronator because if he has the pronator he is hidden this way so strong i think you need do you think that iraqian is this little bit not yes because yeah
SPEAKER_04: I think yes. Do you think that Irakli's wrist is now strong enough to control? Yes, I think strong, I think strong. Strong enough to control Tata Singh's Pornader? Yes, of course, 100% because he know, he know what we do with Tata Hutchins and of course he after last fight with Todd, he will have, he change something in training and he will stay more stronger.
SPEAKER_04: But Tadka can sit in a swimming pool and drink beer and luckily train every day. Yeah, but I think
SPEAKER_02: He's like that, but he's very strong. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know this. I know this, but I hope real sportsmen will win. Yeah, everyone has a style. Ryan Bull Bellinger. Hello, my friend. Great to see you here. Yeah. And Frank, tell us about Irakli Tatachins and let's slowly finish.
SPEAKER_03: In my opinion, Tashin is faster at the start, but I see the racquies very, very prepared. And then I like that way of shooting that has the racquies and I don't know, but Tifo for him. In my opinion it will be a 3 to 0, 3 to 1 for the racquies. On four rounds is a title match. Well, it's still a 4 to 1.
SPEAKER_00: So he's saying that in his opinion Todd Hutchings is faster, but he likes a lot the way that Irakli is pulling. And he thinks that Irakli will win 4-0, 4-1. 4-0 or 4-1? Yeah, something like that. I have a question for both Serhii and Frank. When two guys are competing,
SPEAKER_02: and one is top roller and other one is not top roller and because you guys are top rollers from your mind do you want the top roller to win because you are a top roller like if there is a top roller and then if you flop press would you want flop press guy to win or top roller to win
SPEAKER_03: No, always top because when I see a match and I see someone who pulls and who does top like me a little bit in the same way in the top roller and there's nothing to do and one is forced to do it for you. So you don't do it for me today either.
SPEAKER_00: So Frank's saying that given that he's a two-prawler as well, when he sees someone two-prawling, he can imagine it better, the match, and he sees himself from that point of view. So of course, in general speaking, he feels for the two-prawler.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so he does more like empathy to the top row. He feels like, hey, you need to do this, you need to do that. You don't feel yourself in the position of Jerry, right? And you, Serhii, you feel the same, right? I think 50-50.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, because what do you mean? Have chance guys who don't pull top roll win and have chance. That's not what I'm asking. What I'm asking is that if you see a top roller and a flop press guy in your heart, who do you support?
SPEAKER_02: Top roller. Top roller, yeah, that's what I am saying. Because this is the style you're trading. So you are just looking at the match and you are saying to top roller in your mind, do this, do that. But you never said to wrestle like that. But now I think it's new era arm wrestlers, new younger arm wrestlers and the need.
SPEAKER_04: new school need to have minimum two good technique, you know, the pro when you're the pro tired for you need go to flow press because your opponent around maybe three or four to tire to pro to value hooker for you need to have very good hook and very good good triceps because you open and too much work with biceps after you change and push triceps.
SPEAKER_04: It's everybody needs to have minimum two technique, but of course better is when you have a top roll, flop press, hook and tracers. Frank, when did you start arm wrestling? 2004. 2005. You started in 2005? 2005, yes. 45 kilograms. What were you, five years old or what? I have 11 years old.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, you were a very young star. And you ever heard, Frank, you ever heard the Gardone-Riviera World Championships in 2001? No, no, no. He watched the video but he didn't compete at the time, so he only watched the video. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
SPEAKER_02: He said you looked way more beautiful at that time, Engin. Thank you! Yeah, I was 27 years old. The time is cruel with everybody. No, except you. Except you. You are already, with that smile, you always look good.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Anyway, so guys, thank you. Thank you very, very much, Serhii. I can't wait. I can't wait, Serhii. You are a very, very good arm master, very strong, and you are also a good showman at this stage. And Frank, you are probably the most positive guy in our sport at the elite level. One question, Engin.
SPEAKER_03: So Frank's saying that probably you already thought about that, but he would really love to see Pascal Girard at East vs West.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there are a lot of guys that we would like to see. But every day, Frank, every day, it is becoming harder and harder to be on that stage. A lot of people are coming. I need to invite, like, Pascal.
SPEAKER_02: 20 years ago, one of the best today. Yes, he's a legend. I know, I know. Yeah, the level right now is crazy, crazy, yeah. I don't know. Yeah, Neil Pickup says for East versus West, he says this is Jurassic Park. Yeah, Jurassic Park, yeah. And Serhii is T-Rex, right? Yes, yes.
