SPEAKER_02: I feel good and I already laid off. I'm starting to rest and I'm resting for the competition. You won East vs. West qualifier, right? To qualify for this. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So have you pulled Stoyan before? I think you have, right? Never, because when I competed in 100, he pulled in 90. We were in different classes. He was lighter. So while he's not here,
SPEAKER_03: Tell me why he loses to you. What can I say? I prepared good.
SPEAKER_02: i i watched him intently i know his style and it shouldn't be hard it shouldn't be too difficult now it's good okay yes okay change the camera now we are back to being nice

SPEAKER_04: He is the most classical top roller outside puller. And I always loved pulling those guys. For me, it was always the best. Okay. Stoyan, so I asked Vaso. He said you guys have never pulled because when he was in 100, you were in 90 kilos. But he said he's well prepared to beat your style of arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_01: We talked and he said that no one has ever played with you. You haven't met each other because he has always been 110kg and you have played in the 90kg category. And the word about your style came and he said that you play a very classic top role and he loves to play with opponents who have your style.
SPEAKER_01: Basically, Stoyan is very polite and said, yeah, it's true. They never met in the tournament and it will be a big honor for him and challenge to face him.
SPEAKER_04: Stoyan, this is your second time, right, on East versus West. First time was versus Brandon Alcacer. Am I correct? Yes, yes, of course. Okay. Tell me, on the first time, were you nervous? Because it's a big, big stage. It's probably the biggest stage arm wrestling has seen. So were you nervous in that match or everything was fine? And going into the second match, you won't be nervous? Yeah, explain how you felt.
SPEAKER_01: Ask him how he feels, because this is a big scene. Your debut, how was it? Did you feel nervous? How will you feel during the second match? Do you feel nervous? Do you worry? The format is really big. For me it's an honor to play in it, among the best athletes in this sport.
SPEAKER_00: Indeed, the stage is impressive, the audience is huge, there was a lot of pressure from my side, but after the meetings started, we somehow focused on the matches and we managed to focus on them. But indeed, the atmosphere is incredible and from the very beginning there is this slight pressure.
SPEAKER_01: There is no doubt that IS vs. WES is the biggest stage in the sport and of course there is a lot of excitement going there for the first time. He was nervous at the beginning but after the first round and the match goes on the way
SPEAKER_01: he get calm and the nervousness was away and it was everything fine and the people the atmosphere this is nothing to compare is versus west for sure uh waso is is this the biggest arm wrestling event in in georgia arm wrestling history or i know
SPEAKER_02: In Georgia, this is the biggest win ever. How important is to win there? Like, you don't want to lose at your home, right? How important is to win this match?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I don't think so. That's my opinion. I don't know much about the operation. Now I know that if I go to Georgia and the Georgians come, I don't know much about the operation. Because there is a lot of work to be done and there is a lot of work to do.
SPEAKER_02: uh it doesn't matter that i'm in georgia i don't want to lose outside as well so it doesn't matter for me i don't want to lose either way uh as for the georgia the georgian fans i don't feel like it's a big advantage for me because okay i'm gonna be home and people are gonna be cheering for me but fans can't come up to the stage and help me it's just a one-on-one fight and i don't think it's as big of an advantage as people think
SPEAKER_01: do you feel like he will have advantage because it will be in his home or it doesn't matter
SPEAKER_00: For sure, the audience will give him extra confidence, extra self-esteem, he will mobilize, he will play in front of his compatriots, family, friends, teammates. This gives extra motivation and normally in such situations a person should give 100-200% of himself.
SPEAKER_01: Um, yes, Trian believes that Vaso is going to be highly motivated because you will see your friends, your family, your, your mates, uh, it's your, your, uh, country and Trian truly believes that gives you advantage. So, uh, Vaso, how, how like preparation for this and also your, your mind coming into this and like,
SPEAKER_02: you know you've been pulling for very long time so you know where your best form has been in in your own words tell me where you are now how do you feel uh
SPEAKER_03: Of course, it is in the form of society, which is completely different. For example, in my country, I was born from a child, I was born with a child, and I am not born with such an intention. For example, it is in the form of society for everyone.
SPEAKER_02: I would say I'm probably in the best shape ever. If we go by the weights and by intensity that I trained with, I never lifted those weights. I never could go so hard. So judging by that, I would tend to say that, yeah, probably I'm in the best shape ever. Stojan, do you have answer to that? He's in his best shape and he's going to face you in 10 days.
SPEAKER_01: He asked him how he feels mentally and physically, and he answered that at the moment, judging by the weights he's moving and the intensity he's training with, he's in the best form so far. And Ray asked him what he thought when he heard he was in super form. How do you perceive that? I'm confident in that. In this format, all matches are well selected.
SPEAKER_00: and there are no first-hand players, all of them are proven names, proven champions, and there is no opponent who can be underestimated. It is normal for a person to prepare, to give all of himself for such a serious fight,
SPEAKER_00: I understand. A competition of this caliber is not normal and I expect him to be in a strong form. I don't know if he will be in his best form, but he will be well prepared and will do everything for himself. There is no place for underestimation.
SPEAKER_01: So Stoyan said in this stage there are not random people there and this is exactly what Stoyan expected to face opponent who is chasing his prime and this is what he prepared for and this is what he expects. He's not surprised at all that Vasu is having a big form and he liked that.
SPEAKER_01: For Stojan, what is, in his own mind, Vaso's biggest weakness? I don't know, I can't read it first, I can't say. Maybe when the first match starts,
SPEAKER_00: I will feel his form, his strength, his, my, I will feel the game itself and maybe then I can estimate where we can attack him, so to speak. I have never played with him and he is a strong opponent, a very good technical player.
SPEAKER_00: We play a similar style. In general, I will choose the one in better shape, better prepared.
SPEAKER_01: So from watching videos investigating, he can see exact weak point on Vaso. They both have similar style of pulling and Stoyan is someone who is getting his information when he catches his opponent, when he's starting the setup, when he's going into the first round. This is the moment.
SPEAKER_01: he's getting the information and chasing the weakness of the opponent and getting the information of and he believes at the end it will be who is who is getting bringing more power more best shape because of the style not so far from from away the style of pulling so the best shelf is going to be in the end most important
SPEAKER_01: But the exact weakness he can't say from watching videos. What does he think he does better than Vaso in his armwrestling game? Maybe more experience.
SPEAKER_00: I am not sure about the start, because he is a very good starter, we will see that during the game, but maybe the experience to some extent and I hope the agility to help me.
SPEAKER_01: so stuyan said he believes he has more experience and uh maybe he has a little bit more edge on the on the endurance side he believes and i ask him maybe uh he's fast uh but he said he's not sure that he's faster than us both water fast top roller but let's say summarize maybe a little bit uh endurance and in the experience the years in the arm wrestling
SPEAKER_04: so he's now i think this is second big super match he's pulling does he like super matches or it's like tournaments are his favorite what does he feel um
SPEAKER_00: But in general, the idea is, do you like supermatches or are you more of a tournament player? Well, to be honest, I have a lot of supermatches. Maybe I like competitions and this type of competition more.
SPEAKER_00: Here it is more different because you are preparing for a specific opponent and it is a more different format. Yes, but he is asking who is your favorite, where do you feel better?
SPEAKER_01: So Stojan in East vs West is his second supermatch but in other formats he has other supermatches and it's a completely different world to prepare for a supermatch format or for the tournaments.
SPEAKER_01: um but at the end uh he thinks he's a little bit he likes a little bit more the tournaments than than the super matches but it's completely different preparation because you fix your opponent you study your opponent you train specifically for the opponent and yeah gotcha i'm just trying to get vaso to join back he's like send me like same link
SPEAKER_04: don't know ray if you remember but there is a pretty hard uh match between uh todd hutchins and and in in in vegas years ago 2012 2012. maybe maybe i've seen him maybe most likely should we look at it should we look at it let's look at it give me a second and uh let's hopefully vaso will join us back so uh todd versus toyon 2012 yeah
SPEAKER_04: i don't think there is a footage from of this match there is no yeah i don't see anything i was searching we have to believe him what what what uh what what was uh promotion world or armors or it was in vegas it was in vegas and vendetta
SPEAKER_04: Gotcha. Yeah, I don't know why Vasa isn't joining us here, but he will definitely come on for sure. We'll figure it out. So did you do anything else in your training different preparing for this or maybe in your sparring sessions more?
SPEAKER_00: You are asking about your training, have you changed in some different way since the moment you are training for it? Specifically, have you changed anything in your training that you usually don't do when you are training for competitions? Yes, for this match I focused more on sparring matches with teams that play in a style like mine in order to improve this type of game.
SPEAKER_00: The other thing I noticed is that he is gaining strength, because 105 kg is a little bigger than my category and I expected that he would need more strength. He is a much more powerful and stronger competitor and this is something I noticed.
SPEAKER_01: So Stojan is focused on two main things because Vaso is the bigger guy who is staying in 110 and Stojan is going to up to 105. 105 is normally a little bit bigger weight class for Stojan. He's working on his strength. He wants to have a lot of power strength at 105 kilo.
SPEAKER_01: And second, he's doing a lot of sparring, specific with guys who are going outside, going on top row. A lot of sparring with top row guys. And of course with weights, cables for the end strength, additionally. How long has he been pulling? How long have you been pulling?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, guys, maybe a lot of people who are watching now have been born in 1996.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, my God. 96. Almost 30 years. 29. He changed the phone because his battery died. I also found a small footage of Spongebob and Gushing. You found the footage? Just a bit. Can you send me on WhatsApp? I'm going to put it up screen. Let's see.
SPEAKER_02: Because it's some vendetta trailer. He's hoping that he didn't say that, oh, he ran away, he ran away. No, we would never say that. We would never. Ah, okay, okay.
SPEAKER_02: That's what I wanted to say. It's possible that even if it's in the form, even if it's all devoted to the story, and even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's in the form, even if it's in the form, even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's a scene with a lot of people, even if it's a scene with a lot
SPEAKER_02: I would like to say hello to the viewers, because it was a great match between me and Girshevna. It was a great tournament and a great match. This is the match against Stoyan. 2012. That is some good... 13 years ago, right? Yes, it was 13 years ago.
SPEAKER_01: Why were you struggling so much with Hashing to just win against him? He lacked of power. He said there was not enough power.
SPEAKER_02: yeah he's an old man and you never let an old man start first because they're very strong
SPEAKER_01: He's absolutely right. I agree. Never let thoughts start before you. And never underestimate old competitors or old people in the sport. Lasso, when was the last big supermatch you pulled?
SPEAKER_03: What do you think about Bolo Supermatch? I don't know what to say about it. Bolo is similar to Ruminer.
SPEAKER_02: he doesn't have a big experience in super matches but he last match as he remembers it wasn't against the romanian guy but he doesn't
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he said that he lost easily because he wasn't really in good shape, but he doesn't remember the name who he pulled against. I also don't remember people I lose to. No one should remember. We remember how he pulled John Brzenk. Most importantly, you remember who you beat. That is true. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: so this is a super match it's best of best of five so did you prepare a little bit differently keeping in mind that this will not be like a tournament but this is a super match two screens
SPEAKER_02: Well, that's something different. It's a supermatch now, and I think it's going to be a three-round match. How do you feel about the tournament? Well, the tournament is very competitive.
SPEAKER_03: Obviously, it's very different from the tournament.
SPEAKER_02: I won't say one is more different than the other in terms of preparation, like tournament supermatch. I prepared for Stojan, obviously, because supermatch is so different. In tournament, you train everything on like a mid-level, you know, like jack of all trades.
SPEAKER_02: you have everything but on a on a bit lower level in a super match you specifically know your opponent and you specifically train for him and get really strong in that one specific lane and i've obviously did that i got i got very strong specifically for stoian i just don't feel like you know one is harder than the other
SPEAKER_04: Gotcha. Gotcha. Well, maybe he will find out that super matches can be very tough. If you're not so much stronger than your opponent, it can be very tough. How long has Vassal been pulling? I know Stojan from 1996, but Vassal from? He's been pulling since 1996, but Vassal from? He's been pulling since 1996, but Vassal from?
SPEAKER_03: When Stoyan started, I didn't even know arm wrestling was a sport. I started 2006.
SPEAKER_02: 2006, so 10 years later than Stoyan. Vaso, don't start slow with older guys. I unfortunately cannot move before the goal, so I will move exactly on the goal.
SPEAKER_04: i had travis with a disagree yeah yeah sorry i'll start i'll start on time but you will think it wasn't on time um i want to ask like because you guys been around arm wrestling so since 2006 right since 1996 do you feel like most of us maybe because we're this generation we feel like this is the best time for arm wrestling as as we have grown like never before i want to hear it from stoian first and then from muscle
SPEAKER_01: I understood prime time.
SPEAKER_00: Certainly at the moment armwrestling is on the rise, especially after this format, which is very long compared to a Champions League at the moment, it has become super popular. Maybe at the moment it is at its peak. Over the years there have always been European and world competitions, international competitions,
SPEAKER_01: but with so much popularity, so many social media, there hasn't been one so far. And there are a lot of followers. Stoyan believes that the last years over the East vs West, over the social media, YouTube and everything, this is an absolute peak on armwrestling.
SPEAKER_01: the the years before there was also good tournaments but they are not so often you you got one tournament the year or two maybe of course words europeans and that was everything and now you have first east versus west and you're getting these new fans and people joining the sport this is never seen before definitely
SPEAKER_02: It's been 20-30 years that you've been playing in the club. How is the history of the club? Do you have a lot of fans? Do you have a lot of fans? Yes, there is a lot. There is a lot and there is a lot of progress. You can see it every year.
SPEAKER_02: I definitely agree because you can see year by year it gets better, tougher, people get more professional, they get better and the average level of armwrestling is getting higher as well. So it's definitely the best time.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, then I'm not alone. I'm not alone. It's good to hear. Let's talk about a little bit about the event right from from Russell. So first time in Georgia, something this big, for what do you expect? Do you expect it to be just craziness full of fans? And like, what is the atmosphere right now? Is it feeling like this something big is about to happen?
SPEAKER_02: How do you feel about the atmosphere in Georgia now? What is it like in Georgia? It seems like a big wave is coming and people are going crazy. Because Georgia is the first country to have such a big wave. Yes, that's right. This wave has been in Georgia for a long time. It has been in Georgia for many years.
SPEAKER_03: It's definitely getting very hot and exciting because
SPEAKER_02: in the last few years, in Georgia, definitely the biggest event by far, but East vs. West was so big, it's not even in Georgia compared to anything. The new card is always a sensation, it's a big event. And I believe this one... Rogor? Just to give you some information, it's very interesting.
SPEAKER_03: as it is at home.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, even from the government, you know, like they like the event. It's a lot of support. What he was saying is that anyway, the event was getting big. And even among the big events, this one, I believe it's it's pretty big even compared to other East versus West. And as for the competing in Georgia, I would honestly prefer going outside and competing in other countries because I don't really like pulling in Georgia.
SPEAKER_01: I'm getting a bit nervous sometimes. That's understandable. Stoyan said, yeah, there is definitely pressure if you play at home and there are so many people they don't want to be disappointed.
SPEAKER_02: Well, there's always a question. Yeah, internationalism in Bulgaria happened and he probably knows what he's talking about. He probably knows how I feel.
SPEAKER_04: I want to ask, so this is 105 kilos, I'm correct? Yes. So what are, let's start with Stoyan, what are your goals in this weight class? What is the plan, let's say, for this year? You want to pull after this one, you win, you want to pull more?
SPEAKER_01: Or you don't care who you pull, or you slowly want to work your way out to become a champion. What is the goal? What is your goal in this category of 105 kg? Let's say you win the match. How do you want to stay in this category? Do you want to play with everyone you are playing with? Or do you want to quit, or to climb, or to continue in this category? Do you have any plan in your head?
SPEAKER_00: This category is a bit hard for me, but for me this is a challenge and I would like to try my best to see the level, where I am among the best in this category. But I would feel better in the lower category. For me this one is a bit hard, the creators here are a bit stronger and it will be a bit harder for them, that's what I think.
SPEAKER_01: So Stojan is accepting challenges. That's why he likes to pull at 105 and maybe also to continue to accept challenges. But he believes that this category is a little bit too big for him. And maybe at some point the opponent is going to be too powerful. He doesn't know, but he likes to challenge that.
SPEAKER_01: this um his his assumption that they may be strong but he definitely be comfortable at uh 95. gotcha it's it's natural for him 95 then 90 uh the goals in 105 yeah
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Yeah. He thought it was 2024.
SPEAKER_03: He's a champion, right? Be a champion. Be a champion. That's what I wanted to do. That's what I wanted to do. After that, the first thing I wanted to do was to be in the top three in the rating. And if I didn't make it, I wanted to leave.
SPEAKER_02: okay so my plan is first I beat stoian then I train and I go up and pull a first of top three guys I went against him and then I'll I'll pace carefully and I'll go for the belt in hundred five yes yeah
SPEAKER_04: The belt might be empty because Devon is way bigger than 105 kilos. If someone says, can you drop the weight? I don't think you can. Let's talk about the rest of the talk.
SPEAKER_02: When I ask for a belt match, for a super match, I hope it's Devin. Ooh, that's good. That's good.
SPEAKER_04: So guys, let's play a game. I will ask you about the rest of the matches and you try to pick a winner and tell me why you think who's the winner, who's the favorite and why this guy wins. So we start with the first one. It's this one. Okay. So Vaso, who wins? Stoyan or Vasily? Vaso, I get the match. I go to Stoyan. Vasily goes to Toshvilda. So I go to Toshvilda. I go to Toshvilda. So I go to Toshvilda.
SPEAKER_01: Georgian. Georgian. Georgian. Georgian. Georgian. Georgian. Georgian.
SPEAKER_04: he goes for the win okay so already first first i pick and it's one picks one and other picks another one so i don't know how we will keep it together but uh okay guys um let's talk about some other good matches on east versus west 16. so frank lamparelli versus sergey kanchenko i think i'll stop sharing because wassup first yeah
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's start with Frank Lamparelli and Sergei Kalinchenko. I would like to say that there are a lot of things that are happening in the world, and a lot of things are happening.
SPEAKER_03: I'll explain myself first. I predicted a lot of matches calling the winner and I was wrong a lot.
SPEAKER_02: so now i'll go by um whose style is better against his opponent and who who makes more sense to win basically because i don't know what shape they're in i can't know how strong they are so i'll just go logically by seeing whose style is better so frank versus sergey win frankie that's sergey karinchenko frankly frankie frank
SPEAKER_03: You think he takes the hand and wins?
SPEAKER_02: If they are similar in power, Frank will win. But if Sergei is stronger, then it will be a fight. And then he might win. Stoyan, do you agree with Vasov's assessment? I also think that in this match, the favorite is Frank.
SPEAKER_00: Both of them have the same style of play, both of them are very good dribblers, but Frank is more experienced, more played, he has better hand control. He is more built as a dribbler and I think he is a favorite in this match.
SPEAKER_00: It will be very interesting, but this is my prediction.
SPEAKER_01: still believe that's going to be very interesting match and he has also frank as favorite because he's all rounded arm wrestler a little bit more around it and experienced arm wrestler than clementenko both are outside poor top rows and he believed that frank is gonna have a little bit more hand control he will catch the hand control and uh we win okay so so both on the same page
SPEAKER_04: This is an interesting match. I don't know, maybe you both know about Brett Grundy. So Brett Grundy will face Bacho Segundzhevili. Stoyan, I want to hear your thoughts on this match. This match, in my opinion, Bacho has more chances. I think he is much stronger.
SPEAKER_01: I think he prepared very seriously for this match. And maybe explosive. And more explosive, yes. He is very strong. For his weight, he is very strong. Ok, so Stoyan believes that in this match clear favorite is Bachum because he is very explosive, very strong for his weight and clear favorite for him.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. With Vaso's goals at 105 kilo, one of these guys could be his next opponent. What does he think? Vaso, he is our opponent. He is our opponent. He is our opponent. He is our opponent. He is our opponent.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, it was hard for both of us. I mean, it was really hard for me to win this match. Now, I want to say this. Baccho has a lot of style and he has a lot of style. I mean, he has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of style. I mean, Baccho has a lot of
SPEAKER_02: I think Bacho is a favourite. He's very strong, very explosive as well. And I watched him pull. I know his style. And I know he's very strong. And recently I looked up Brad as well. I watched his matches and he's undoubtedly a very strong boy as well. I think Bacho has an advantage and he's a favourite. He's going to win.
SPEAKER_04: okay okay again both on the same page very good very good um we go pro well this is a big match right super heavyweights i think first time david uh oh he went to super heavyweights to fight morozov so i think it's the second time david dadikian alex kurdecha we start with vaso what does vaso thinks super heavyweight david
SPEAKER_03: Now, Gurdetsha is a great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,
SPEAKER_03: Now, David, no matter how much weight he has on his shoulders, he has to lose weight. If he weighs 15 kilos, he will lose weight. If he has a lot of weight on his shoulders, he will lose weight. If he has a lot of weight on his shoulders, he will lose weight.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so Alex, he has a physical advantage because he's bigger, taller, he's a top roller, and he may have a
SPEAKER_02: like a power advantage as well for david i feel like he's faster and he he's more technical a very big thing in this match is how how much quality is in daddy kian's weight because he used to even cut to 105 if it's a good quality weight i would say he he can win and he's a favorite but if it's all water weight it's i don't think it's as as good as it could have been
SPEAKER_00: But he went 50-50 for this match. It's very hard to say which one is going to win. Stoyan, what do you think? I think Alex has more chances in this fight. His size, strength, long arm, big fist.
SPEAKER_00: Can we add that you train often with Gosko and your experience with such big opponents makes you think that this is... Yes, and in my opinion, yes, of course it will be interesting, although he is very strong, very brave, but in my opinion here the chances are more on the side of the chordist.
SPEAKER_01: So Stoyan believes that because of the size of Alex and Stoyan is someone who is training with Georgy Tvetkov regularly and he understands very well that the size of a super heavyweight matters a lot.
SPEAKER_01: uh he has no doubt that the match is gonna be interesting and that uh uh that he can is gonna try uh everything like uh also said he can be very fast but at the end the difference in the size and in the strength is gonna be on the side of uh alex gotcha this is this is ins i think it will be insane much my my opinion i think it will be insane i think we all agree on that who do you got right
SPEAKER_04: Who do you got? I also have 50-50. I lack information. We'll see. No, wait, wait. It went full circle. We go to women's 70 kilo match. Two good friends going to fight for world title at 70 kilos. We have Fia and Malin. Stojan, what do you think? Malin. Malin? Malin, yeah. Why?
SPEAKER_00: Why? She has already won once. Yes, just by looking at the statistics, it really shows that Malin has more chances. I mean, he has won both as a style and generally as a way of playing, the experience on the other hand.
SPEAKER_00: They know each other very well and I don't think it will be difficult for Malin
SPEAKER_01: He believes that Malin has more experience. They know each other very well. And Malin having more experience is getting more advantage from that. They know each other very well. And also the statistic shows that Malin won last Supermatch. That's why he believes that Malin is still going to win. What does Vaso think?
SPEAKER_02: I think it's in the title, FIARISEC and Malin Bergström. If you know it, you can let us know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: As I know they're big friends. They know each other's style very good and I feel like none of them have a big advantage.
SPEAKER_04: So I feel like it's going to be very close and very tough match. I would go 50-50 as no one really has a big advantage. Okay. This is exciting match. We waited for this match for a long time. Oleg Zok, Daniel Prokopchuk. Vaso, what do you think left arm? Can Daniel beat Oleg Zok at 85 kilos?
SPEAKER_02: Oleg Zhokhi and Daniel Prokofchuk. If I'm not mistaken, Daniel's name is written on his shirt. That's right. Stylistically speaking, Oleg Zhokhi and Daniel Prokofchuk. That's right. That's right.
SPEAKER_03: Stylistically, I would say Oleg.
SPEAKER_02: Stojan, what do you think? I think...
SPEAKER_00: The favorite in this match is Zsoch because of his physique and the category in which they play. Dani is very strong, very resilient. He prepared for this match quite well, but Zsoch is very uncomfortable and it will be very difficult for him. That's why I think Zsoch will be able to win.
SPEAKER_01: okay so as John said that Daniel is amazing athlete he's very strong unique but he's light and to beat because of his absolute advantage his size of the arm and the style of pulling he believes that
SPEAKER_01: um it's going to be very difficult for for uh daniel to pull against him and he has um um oleg is a favorite because of the size advantage again gotcha uh this is amazing match i i also go 50 50 on this oleg petrenko but kill yoni um
SPEAKER_00: Stoyan, what do you think about this match? We have power versus insane endurance. Very interesting match. Stoyan will be very consistent. This is on the left hand, right? Yes, I know. Petrenko is very powerful, very strong. On Uniani it will be very difficult, but in my opinion
SPEAKER_00: Uniani will win. He's very ambitious, I've been following his last matches, he's giving it his all, he's putting in a lot of effort, he's very confident, he's put in a lot of effort and he's very resilient. He has a lot of chances. And we don't know how Petrenko's mental state will be when he comes back. Exactly, statistically, one of them is winning after winning, while the other one is a bit upset and he's not focused, he's not confident.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so I'm going to translate. Two amazing athletes. Of course, Oleg is really powerful. So you have Oleg who gets very hard loss. So Stian is not sure how he got recovered after this match with Devin.
SPEAKER_01: And then for the other side, you have Uniani, who is rising match after match. He's getting better, he's getting stronger, he's getting even more endurance. He's in a really strong run, facing someone who suffered a big loss at East versus West. And that's why he believes that at the end, Bakhtiri Uniani is going to win.
SPEAKER_03: How did you come to know about Betkili and Oleg Petrenko in March, 1995? I came to know about them in one conversation I had with them. They were two years old. They were very young. They were very young when Betkili was born.
SPEAKER_02: uh it's definitely gonna be um it's definitely gonna be one of the biggest matches the most exciting one uh that night uh i would say particularly is probably gonna win by endurance they're gonna get in hook just stuck on each other very long match and he's sure that it won't end quickly it's gonna be a very long very long grueling match okay i want to ask all of you
SPEAKER_04: Do you think that at any point in the match that Kili smiles? Yes. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: I'm asking if you think that in some cases he will laugh while Bektiri is playing, he will smile. Will he have such a moment during the Supermatch? I'm sure that in the first two matches there won't be such a moment, but if he manages to delay it and take it, I mean, he's playing in a very aggressive way, maybe towards the last match or the decisive match we can see such a moment.
SPEAKER_01: So Stoyan said for sure the first two rounds there are going to be no smiles but maybe at the last or fifth round or the last round there will be smiles there. Yes, I think so. If you think about it, if you think about it, if you think about it, if you think about it, if you think about it, if you think about it, if you think about it, if you think about it, if you think about it, if you think about it,
SPEAKER_04: I think he's gonna smile in the first round. First round. We should put stakes on this, right? I'm gonna make him laugh, okay? I'm gonna make him laugh. Good.
SPEAKER_04: okay this is this is one of the super big ones like everyone's very excited about that i'm really excited we have oh yeah 95 kilo right arm todd hutchings versus iraqli zirakashvili like this is this is really big match i want to hear vaso's thoughts on this one didi machi 2015 tituli iraqli zirakashvili todd hutchings
SPEAKER_03: I'm not going to lie to you. I'm not going to lie to you in the first place. And I'm not going to lie to you either. Most important? If I go far away from America, if I go far away from here, I'm going to die. I don't think we're going to die in any way. Why do you think you're going to die? Why do you think you're going to die? I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: ah okay uh so for iraqi the the biggest point in a match is not letting todd in his lane and not let him like actually pull he should shut him down as soon as possible and if todd actually gets in his shoulder then it's a problem if he doesn't iraqi will win easily and even if tozilla wins we we're gonna steal the belt for him we're not gonna give the belt away
SPEAKER_00: Dimitar, ask Stoyan. Stoyan, what do you think about this match? What will happen? It will be a very interesting match. I can't say specifically who would be the big favorite. On the one hand, Rakly is very strong, very technical creator, very confident, very ambitious. Now he's going to make a vendetta, for the second time he's going to play
SPEAKER_00: That's why he wants to protect the belt and the international audience. He will do everything for himself. On the other hand, Todd Hutchins is very confident in his victory. He is not underestimated at all. He is very strong and resilient. I can't say who will win. It will be a very interesting match for sure.
SPEAKER_00: The first matches if Tottenham stop the game, they will probably take the match. But if in the first matches Iraklito dominates, Tottenham will defend themselves.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so Stjona said absolutely very difficult match to make any guess on it. Herakles chasing his best shape after best shape.
SPEAKER_01: he has the belt he wants to defend it in any price in his own city country from the other side that is very confident in his preparation um the the key is gonna be the first round if uh todd is putting some some breaks on on iraqli how easy
SPEAKER_01: are the first two rounds for Irakli. If Irakli is getting damaged, he's not going to be able to have fast pins. Even if he wants first or second round, but he gets a lot of damage, it's going to be this seven-round championship match. It's really difficult to predict and Stjian can't say what is going to happen. He doesn't have a favorite. He only knows that this is going to be an absolutely crazy match.
SPEAKER_04: I think everyone can agree to this. I think everyone. We got to go to the big ones. Let's get this one. Okay. This, I don't know. There's like at least five matches for the potential match of the night. And this probably headlines it all. Michael Todd, Hermes Gasparini. Vaso, what do you think? Did match of the night. Hermes Gasparini. Yeah, Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_03: I think I missed. Yeah, Michael may like
SPEAKER_02: Very interesting match, very interesting.
SPEAKER_00: Michael Todd, with his style, very uncomfortable, very, on the other hand, experienced, a strong player. I have the impression that lately he has been doing personal achievements, he is gaining a lot of strength. He is ambitious and looks so eager to the belt in this heavy category. On the other hand, Gasparini,
SPEAKER_00: Very strong, very motivated, very prepared. It will be a very interesting match. I can't say who is my favorite. But it also depends on how the two fights will go.
SPEAKER_00: In the first matches, if Michael Toth manages to block, to hold and to kill the throw of Hermes, to put his skill into play, I think he will take the game. On the other hand, if Gasparini has prepared well enough physically, hand control and manages to take the games faster, because Michael Toth is very durable.
SPEAKER_01: again about amazing athletes uh i think this is also a compliment and an engine because this is a second match that uh can't pick a clear winner uh or he it depends how the match starts uh the the motivation of the site of thought is very big he's uh
SPEAKER_01: chasing prs we can see that on his channel and also he is very focused to get the belt from from levan he has a clear target but from the other side he gasparini is also in good shape very fast he's definitely gonna get more hand control
SPEAKER_01: and it depends again how the first rounds are going how much energy is gonna lose in the first round Hermes and because of the style how Michael is pulling he may
SPEAKER_01: bring ms in the deep water in the really hard fight when he's losing a lot of energy and then at the end he may can win or hermes is getting really flush pins in the first rounds and go go to the to the end so 50 50 from the start of stream
SPEAKER_04: It's great when people pick a match 50-50. This is very close. In my opinion, it will be like a chess game. The guys will play chess. This is another big one. This is the rematch. I want to start with Stoyan. I want to start with you. What do you think about the question?
SPEAKER_00: Who wants to start with me? What do you think? You go first. Very interesting match. From match. Just the two of them are... Crazy match. Crazy. Crazy man from everywhere.
SPEAKER_01: No clue. He has no idea what can happen at the table. This is insanity. Great answer.
SPEAKER_01: Very strong, very technical. Very strong, very technical. Absolutely amazing experience, trade, craziness, everything is here. Mega crash. Mega crash. Okay, Vaso. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_03: We need two Oscars for this match. For the best actor of the year. For both of them.
SPEAKER_04: At this point, I'm not really interested in who's going to win because I'm going to have a very good time just watching the match. Yes, I feel like the match, like armwrestling, we're going to be separate from the rest of the thing.
SPEAKER_03: Do you like how wrong Devon's picture is now that he looks like? It's two different human beings.
SPEAKER_03: Georgians are different, everyone is different, our forms are different. When Gennady was born, he was in a very good shape. I was born in a very good shape. After that, now he is in a good shape, he is a good person, and he will be very successful, as I said before, and if he can do it, he will be able to do it.
SPEAKER_02: I'd say Gennady, I feel like Gennady is going to win. And I'm not saying this because I'm a Georgian, because I'm saying this because I trained with Gennady. And when he pulled Michael, his shape was so, so bad. I myself, I didn't even think he would win one round. If I was Gennady, I may have not even pulled that match.
SPEAKER_02: uh but now i can see he's getting better and uh i wouldn't be surprised and he may win easier than he did first time
SPEAKER_01: Should I, for a second, translate that for Stoyan, but I think it's interesting. He says that he trains with Gennady and when Gennady played with Michael Todd, he doesn't believe in how bad form and how unprepared Gennady is. He doesn't believe that he will even take a round, and the match was very close. At the moment Gennady is in incredible form judging by his preparation and he believes that he is a favorite and will win the game.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, guys, we're going to go to the main event. Vitaly versus Morozov. I've seen crazy polls where people pick 89%, 90% that Vitaly wins. Do you guys agree or do you think it will be differently? Let's start with Vaso.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to ask you a question. How do you feel about the fact that 90% of the population is Italian? How do you feel about that? I feel 90% of the population is Italian.
SPEAKER_03: That 90% that you just mentioned, I mean those 90%.
SPEAKER_02: I would say Vitaly is a heavy favorite and he has an advantage in a lot of lanes. He's bigger. He's taller. He's faster. He has great endurance. He's very strong. Morozov may be a bit stronger in raw power, but only that doesn't matter in a fight. I feel like Vitaly is a big favorite. He has a big advantage on Artyom.
SPEAKER_01: Stoyan, do you agree? Stoyan, the question was that, in principle, Vitaly is the favorite. People say that 90% give to him. He asked him, what do you and Vaso think, and it turned out that Vitaly is a big favorite for him.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I support the general opinion that Vitaly has more chances on the side. He has put in strength, more weight, experience, speed, hand control. This is very good for such a match. Morozov, we all know how strong he is, but Vitaly will not be convenient for him in any case. In my opinion, Vitaly has more chances.
SPEAKER_01: So basically, Stian almost agree. Yeah, he agreed that Vitaly is favorite because not only of the size, he's putting also weight, he's getting also a lot of power and he will be very
SPEAKER_01: difficult for Morozov to pull against this type of hitting top row. And Vitaly is going to be the favorite. But yeah, he believes the consensus that the most people are right. Okay. I want to hang it out to people. Everyone called me crazy. I think and I hope Artem is going to win.
SPEAKER_04: i'm the 10 delusional everything is possible everything is possible yeah it is it is we will see but um i guess we're gonna end this soon so we'll finish this on message to each other so let's start with vaso what is your message before you meet in in tbilisi in next week versus story what is your message to him
SPEAKER_03: I would like to ask you to write a message to the audience. Now I would like to ask you to write a message to the audience. One or two years ago, when I was a little boy, I was a little boy. When I was a little boy, I was a little boy.
SPEAKER_02: look at his finger after surgery it doesn't open it's like this so you you better not go outside you better choose another lane you can't open his finger
SPEAKER_01: His finger is operated and it doesn't open at all. There is no movement of the hand. This is his message to you. Do you have a message to him? Finally. Finally. I hope he is in good condition, in good shape and we will make a good match.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. So, Stoyan hopes that you are for real in your best shape and you're moving big weights and he's very happy to have a great match with you. I'm very happy to have a great match with you. I'm very happy to have a great match with you. I'm very happy to have a great match with you. I'm very happy to have a great match with you. I'm very happy to have a great match with you. I'm very happy to have a great match with you.
SPEAKER_03: I don't mean to say that I don't like it, but I do like the sport. Now I want to talk about something that I've been thinking about for a long time, and I want to talk about something that I've been thinking about for a long time, and I want to talk about something that I've been thinking about.
SPEAKER_03: Jokes aside, I obviously wait for
SPEAKER_02: Tough match, and I'm excited for this, and I respect Stojan as well. And he knows we know each other for too long. We can joke around. We're friends. And I just want to say that I train really hard and that I am here. It's already a big path for me. It's a big task. And just because I say that I'm very confident and I talk like this doesn't mean that I'm irresponsible for the match. It's obviously very important. And I'm waiting for a tough match with Stojan.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. And even if I win easily, it doesn't mean anything. I worked really hard for this.
SPEAKER_04: well guys i'm really excited we are just one week away we're going to see each other very very soon east west 16 as usual all the information everything is in description get your pay-per-views this this will be great match as well as many others tomorrow same time i'm going to be live with brett grandy and bacho saganishvili again i have to help engin out engin is in tbilisi already doing some extra work so
