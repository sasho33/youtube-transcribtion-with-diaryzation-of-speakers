SPEAKER_03: How you doing, young man? I am doing great. How are you? Come on, man. Come on. I feel rejuvenated. Yeah. You ready to fly? Yeah, I got it. I'm going to take the bus, then the train, and then get on the flight. Oh, okay. Last time, I went right to the flight. This time, I'm going bus, train, flight.
SPEAKER_03: Where are you? I'm at home. I'm talking about my arm wrestling career and the matches. I'm not going to let you put me first class on the airplane this time. I'm going to the bus first, then the train, then the flight. Okay. Yeah. I thought my first bus ride was going to be intriguing.
SPEAKER_03: Because I had it all planned out. You want to listen to my plan? Okay, yeah. Tell me your plan, yeah. My plan was to have a fun match and beat up on Alden Larratt because they was talking a little too much. You know what I mean? He was there. They was talking a little too much. But I do understand that that is a gross... That is a mismatch. I do understand that. But my plan...
SPEAKER_03: was to, you know, sew some jabs at the Laird family, right? In a fun way, in a fun way. Make sure that I- No need to get upset, no need to get- Make sure, well, you gotta be careful now, because I know that I enjoy, I enjoy when people say stuff, trash talk back to me. Like, as soon as they do it, I'm like,
SPEAKER_03: Like, this is fun, I'm laughing, but I do know if you say something crazy about my kids, eh, sometimes it gets weird. Now the problem starts? Sometimes. Maybe not. It's really never happened to me that much, except with football. Like, you know, somebody will say... Listen, listen, listen. Your son being that famous and not to be...
SPEAKER_03: Like experiencing such thing is not possible because I'm sure sooner or later, sooner or later, he will have a bad day. And then it's already had it. It's already had bad days. They like to talk, but I don't know those people. I don't have to have breakfast with them the next morning. You are not going to go and find them. Exactly. And if I was around them.
SPEAKER_03: there wouldn't be no more of that. I wouldn't be able to handle them talking like that, right? So I'm glad that that's the way it is. So I'm thinking to myself, I whack Alden. I start throwing a couple of jabs over at Jody, right? Making sure that I'm telling security to come get Jody away from here. You know what I mean? I don't want to smack the shit out of the whole family. You know what I mean? Like I got everybody yelling.
SPEAKER_03: Alden trying to climb up on my thumb, but, man, he can't play that game with me. I already know. Once I set that palm in a certain spot, your height only makes it worse for you. So go on, get up there. And then, of course, that was the bus ride, right? The bus ride would have been fun, right? Because, you know, I think the world would have loved for Alden to cheer for Alden.
SPEAKER_03: And I, you know, it's all good. I mean, no problem. And then I'm thinking as soon as the match is over, I've almost stepped over the line. Oh, right. So you will push the borders. It's just the excitement. And then, you know, how the six rounders going and like four rounds, there's a lot of time once you're in control.
SPEAKER_03: to have conversations, you know, in between matches. And I'm sure that that shit's gonna bother Devin. I mean, he's already, we know 100%, we know 100% that he is a psychopath, right? No one has ever went as hard as him.
SPEAKER_03: I believe, right? Like he is the number one guy when it comes to microphone, half moon,
SPEAKER_00: You're talking about the press conference things? Yeah. I thought you didn't like his trash talk. Every time you get the microphone, you say that, hey, all these guys, they don't know how to do it. Let me handle it. Psychopath. I know that he just 100% gets in his brain that there's a problem, and then he will attack on the microphone and on interviews. And honestly...
SPEAKER_03: Really aggressive, really aggressive face to face. Really aggressive. The question, would you be intimidated? Here's the most important thing about the fight is why are you in the fight? Which fight? Arm wrestling? Yes. The arm wrestling fight that we would be involved in, the promotion, the history.
SPEAKER_03: every single thing and if you tell me that all that is ignited because he thinks that i disrespected his son or his family in any capacity i am thinking there could be a new level of absolute beef of a promoter talker aggressive attitude touching
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it could get pretty crazy. Yeah, but the question, what if Adam beats you if they accept the match? I mean, they accept it on the program, but if this match happens, why? Come on, man.
SPEAKER_00: Come on, get out of here. Okay, okay, the question. Could you beat him if you were 260, if there is a weight cap, 260? I always weigh 260. That's what I weigh. I thought you were 275. No, you are 260. I got to get to 275. I always weigh 260. So if there is a weight cap of 260, you would pull him? Listen, that is, for me...
SPEAKER_03: That is just like pulling Derek Smith left-handed. It was a bus ride, okay? I can handle bus rides all across the world, okay? Now, to me, if I ever would pull Walden, I think it would create some bad blood. I believe that Devin would be definitely way more aggressive than normal.
SPEAKER_03: and that that would make me more aggressive than normal. And then that could have been the train ride, right? The bus ride is Alden, right-handed. The train ride is, you know, that thing getting so aggressive that... What if the train ride would never happen because there is a bus accident that you will have? Yeah, yeah, come on, man. No? No? Come on.
SPEAKER_00: Listen, and then before you know it, it'd be me and Devin left-handed, which would be a money, a money match. How will you, how will you, how will you come to that match?
SPEAKER_03: Will you come there? That's what I'm saying. Like, I can see the bus ride creating a problem that would also create, you know, I mean, I don't know. Listen, you wouldn't come there to be humiliated by Devon, right? Of course, because you already know the cost of being down early. Oh, man. I mean, what he did to Petrenkov, it was, you know, you don't want to be in that position where
SPEAKER_00: You have no option in the first round. And if you pull his son, and if you win, and if you are disrespectful, and then he will never let that match end. I know. Yeah. Right? And once I'm able to just be perfectly devastating,
SPEAKER_03: right strong precise on point and get that win all of a sudden all of a sudden now i'm one of them guys okay so you are basically saying you are basically saying okay now i understand i was like
SPEAKER_00: Whenever I ask you, are you ready for the flight, I was talking you coming to Tbilisi. Of course, I'm ready for that. Well, two flights. You are now talking about some different flights. I'm talking about my arm wrestling career, bus ride, train ride, take the flight. Last year, you put me right on the flight.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yes, yes, yes. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. And listen, listen, I apologize. And I really didn't think that like, like you needed more time. I didn't really realize that, but I, yes, now I realize, but you are saying I'm very happy to hear that you are still motivated. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a good time. That's the most important part. Yeah. Good time.
SPEAKER_03: Good time for arm wrestling. Everybody that's involved in arm wrestling is excited about it. It doesn't even matter if they're competing anymore. They've never had the questions come up about who you think is the best guys in the world before. There would be times when you would have a guy still saying that someone was the best guy, and the guy hasn't even arm wrestled for two years. That's the world that we lived in 20 years ago.
SPEAKER_03: Everybody knows everybody. They want to know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. I want to know how come Rustam Babayev is not one weight class lower than he competes. Is that even possible? Or is he just too big for that? Oh, no, he's around like he's around 215 to 220 daily life. So you are talking about him to make 187.
SPEAKER_00: 187, is it 187 or 189? No, no, there is no 187. And then we have 209. Of course. And he's in the 209, right? Yeah, he's in 209. But if you realize it, he just pulled a super match against Sanderis at 231. Yeah. Yeah. I need, we need Babayev. You need, you and Robert.
SPEAKER_03: and um core sports whoever the ultimate conglomerate is of these events soon hey the pride and the um the exposure is going to push it needs to push some guys like russom
SPEAKER_00: to drop that weight. And maybe he's not the guy to do it. No, he's not bad. Just remember, he's not doing bad. He just beat Sandris. Okay, you're gone. That he's a guy. Okay, he just beat Sandris. And then before that, he beat Pauline in Orlando. And he lost against Gherakli, but it was 3-2, if you remember.
SPEAKER_00: And the one who had the buckle lost the round. So if Irakli started with the buckle, possibly it was Rustem winning 3-2. Right now, I don't talk about Rustem so much because it is like a dark horse. I want to keep him like a dark horse, you know. But it is inevitable that Petrenko is now in 95 and Tatachins is there. We saw how good Kana is.
SPEAKER_00: Irakli and Rustam, you know, and maybe Samusha will come up. And we have a lot of good matches. But I really like what you are saying about the bus, train and flight. Yeah. Yeah, I'm happy about it. And, you know, as long as I'm in charge, you have all the credit, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Let's go, let's go, let's go. Yeah, yeah, I'm listening. You guys are the real heroes. What's up with the... You guys did not pop up, you know, today, you know. I know what you guys have done in the past and huge respect for you guys. Yeah, what's going on? You have... Did you already have a podcast today or you got one later today? No, I have with you. Like every other day I'm trying to do the match podcast on the East vs. West channel.
SPEAKER_00: And then I will try to do like a single guest podcast here. What's the most intriguing match? There's too many good matches. What do you say? Too many good matches for Tbilisi. Yeah, yeah. Listen, listen. When these guys were not well-known, like people wouldn't consider these cards.
SPEAKER_00: like super good or still very very good but just now more the community get to know about these guys like now they know who bad kill is but a year before only like really really crazy arm wrestling fans would know these guys but these guys were already monsters at waff so now they're at the big stage
SPEAKER_00: and under spotlights, and people understand how good these guys are. And I'm very happy that they get the respect they deserve. You want to talk about those matches? First of all, I think Adam wants to pull against you. But I think if you can make 260, then I can push you. No, man, there's no way.
SPEAKER_03: no way that that family is gonna let that happen to that young man forget about it no chance no chance um but can you beat him at you come on man come on come on yeah it's not even close get out of here yeah get out of here he can't listen him and artem him and artem are a good match
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you can't neither. I can beat them two on the way. Okay, so you don't want this match. Okay, I understand. Oh, no, I just want to make sure that if Alden and you and Devin and Robert Baxter set up a match between me and Alden, then you guys all are going to take responsibility for that entire process.
SPEAKER_03: Which means me absolutely killing this kid and talking to just borderline security needed smack. Devin then hybrid, like who knows? He probably Navy seal in from the top of one of them atriums with a machete.
SPEAKER_03: And we'd all be in trouble. But if we got through that, we could set up the most unbelievable comeback left-handed match in the history of the world. And then after I show everyone exactly how to handle the procedure of arm wrestling him without a 25 minutes of setup and referee problems, then I would be back to relative.
SPEAKER_03: However, I don't think that there's no way that, listen, do you remember how protective Devin Laird was of his brand at one time? Yeah. There were times when he was very conscious about, he didn't just arm wrestle for fun. He bobbed and weaved and made sure that he had to lose weight, whatever it took.
SPEAKER_03: to at one point, you know, even be declared the best arm wrestler in the world a little bit earlier than he should have been. And to this day, I'm not sure he ever woke up the right hand champion of the world. You know what I mean? Now, what's extraordinary is that if you're in ever in that top three. So you are saying that Devon has never been the best right arm in the world?
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I'm thinking about there would, I don't know a time. How about 2008? Yeah, no, not even close. Well, how is it that, how is it that John Brzezink? Well, I'm just saying like that John Brzezink that you say, I guess was the best, was not the best either. No, no, he was not at his best, but who was better than him in 2008? Oh, I think that Pushkar would have been the guy.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. And it's not that. It's just we all know that if this were then, we would have known. He would have pulled a young Shaflank off. He would have pulled Pushkar a few times. I mean, it wouldn't have just been, you know, some hypothetical way to climb the tree. And listen, I'll tell you this.
SPEAKER_00: Right now, how good is this dude? And he's still not recognized as the number one guy. So it's very difficult. I mean, I mean, right, right now we are living in a era that Levan Saganashvili is here, you know, so it is very, very hard to have that, that, that title of being
SPEAKER_03: The best one, LeVon. And I'll tell you another thing that's crazy impressive on Devin's behalf and on John's behalf is that when you are in the talks of being the greatest at ever at one point and you can still make other weight classes, I mean, come on. That's a whole nother level of weirdo awesomeness. So I believe that no matter how awesome LeVon's history goes,
SPEAKER_03: There will always be people that value the fact that Devin and John had the ability to walk around, you know, smaller. So that's crazy. I mean, Devin walks around probably super heavyweight, a little bit above like the heavyweight category. But John was like most like the middleweight majority. Yeah, but just imagine like whenever I see Devin, I see that he's on a mission to get bigger.
SPEAKER_00: And I feel like it's been like that. Like I've never been around. Devon's structure is a super heavyweight structure. And he's eating everything he can. Everything. There is another thing that like, I also, Devon also agree about this, that I think that 115 kilo, 253 for heavyweight category is kind of too high. I think, you understand? Like.
SPEAKER_00: I think maybe about 220 or something should be like super heavyweight. No doubt. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there'll be one 400-pounder, but the 253 guys, those champions can compete with everybody. I agree. I agree. Yeah. Anyway, so, yeah, so let's see. Let's see. But I think the 275-travers is favorite, 260-travers.
SPEAKER_00: He's a basketball player. And I think Arden with the endurance and the open arm top roll, he will, he will. But listen, I will tell you something, Travis. Can you imagine? But listen, I'm not talking about you prepared you. I'm not talking about prepared Travis. I'm talking about basketball player Travis. Yeah, yeah. But can you imagine losing there on the stage to Arden? No, no.
SPEAKER_03: But what do you think that would be? Probably like you would even quit commentating, you know? Yeah, I wouldn't ever be. I'd have to check in with the whole family before I did anything. I'd have to call Devin and ask him if I could go to the bathroom. Their whole family. Yeah, that would be terrible for the major brand. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and they are going to ask your son, is that your dad? That is so true, yeah. They all made fun of me when I lost to Corey. You listen, Corey is a serious dude, you know? Yeah, I know. I'm just telling you that they all 100%. You saw Corey versus Tobias. Corey, any match in strap, Corey won.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. So Tobias is very strong guy. So he's very good. So what I just say, um, I think, I think, uh, so you saw Tobias even, I think beat, uh, Camille one round, right? Of course he did. And he was all up in that shit, man. And listen, there is a, you know, Camille, man, once he gets desperate,
SPEAKER_00: I mean, he's as bad as Devin when it comes to, like, come on, man. Come on. Come on. Come on. It's too much. You got to, you got to. Listen, listen, listen. We really, like, I need a good meeting with the referees, both about this and both about this. But I think we fixed the problem. I mean, this is okay. But this down angle is not. But this is okay.
SPEAKER_00: People don't realize, people want me to bend this one as well, the parallel. But just like, listen, it's because, listen, if humerus is parallel, then like, remember the pin pad is five centimeter higher than the elbow pad. So, I mean, if the shoulder is above, it should normally come. So they are saying that there is a problem with the range of motion, you know.
SPEAKER_00: And I understand that part, but just any rule application about this subject needs to be taught very well and then needs to be analyzed a long time. Like some guy has 170 degrees, some guy will have 160. Like a referee cannot really stop the match and say, one second, one second, let me measure, you know, which arm.
SPEAKER_00: You know, so right now is the best solution. The Humerus bone being parallel is okay. Anything down angle is a foul. This is, if anyone wants to have a, I understand what Yanis is saying and Yanis knows what he's talking about. A lot of people just goes and throws mud to him without even understanding what he's saying.
SPEAKER_00: I also talked with Yanis. I said, Yanis, you can't really start something without having a solution. That solution is not today's subject. Because you can't really try to fix what you think unfairness while causing another unfairness to the people with the problem with the arm. I understand what he's saying.
SPEAKER_00: And he's saying right things, but that the solution of this is not simple. Like you don't, you don't tell referee, Oh, if you think it came to do that angle, okay, give the match or we, uh, it doesn't work that way. You know, we need much more professional and scientific, uh, solution for that. You know? Yeah. I think two things that when I hear that is I, I really, really agree with Yannis about.
SPEAKER_03: the difficulty and um the range of motion that caught like if you have bad range of motion you are you're in that straight position
SPEAKER_03: Right. Which is so comfortable in some weird way. And that's why we can't allow it to happen. Right. You can't have your shoulder underneath the table and your arm perfectly straight. Right. We know that. But some people that range of motion is still got that arm, you know, in this position. So I understand what he's saying. What I want to say is that they just raise the pen pad a half inch. Yeah. Yeah. But listen, you can't do that. But just imagine.
SPEAKER_00: Just because of solving one problem, and then you are raising the pad, and just imagine that all those guys that stopped the match right here, and then come and win, now they will all lose the match. No doubt. But I also believe that what we're saying is- So we are going to change the results of many other match.
SPEAKER_00: while we are trying to fix the problem so we need to really come and sit and talk and a lot of people need to get involved but that is for sure not an easy uh solution there is there is there you will say something there will be some negative so no doubt and i will tell you this i think that you have to be careful where you raise the pen pad because in a tournament that inch is vital and you could argue that in a tournament
SPEAKER_03: The risk reward of solving this problem could stop this pro I get it, but we're in a day where it's four matches to win three everywhere. Most of the time for.
SPEAKER_03: so if four super matches i'm totally okay with this guy losing that match round one and this guy losing that match round two and then let's see how they work it out as the time goes on but there is no doubt that what you're saying will happen and if you make the decision too drastically
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you really in trouble. So we just ride it out and we start, you know, you have to know that we'll evolve at being better at finishing someone in that Kings move open top role. We just need some time to to evolve. All we've evolved is the fact that the move has evolved. Well, now the counter will start. I bet you more people now are genuinely working
SPEAKER_03: on finishing by losing their hand in that open top roll than ever before. So, you know, because right now, it's like, as soon as you get to the very top, one of them dudes is holding on and pushing. It just defines who's going to have to do it. You would never think it was going to be LeVon so early in him and Devin's match, but that's what it was, right? And I got a feeling that
SPEAKER_03: A guy like LeVon doesn't even have to work on that if he doesn't have people at practice hanging off of the table in the most awkward positions in the world because he's trying to get ready for war with Devin. Let's move on because like this subject has been there for like 20 years and
SPEAKER_00: Every few years it gets heated like this, but at least now everyone is in agreement that the humorous bone being parallel right now is accepted widely. And I'm happy, it's good for arm wrestling. Then this is just hanging on there. I mean, it's terrible. Okay, there is protect, saves, risks versus rewards. Thank you for your super chat.
SPEAKER_00: okay let's let's let's start let's start so you and i also we are in agreement right we are in agreement and about about about uh when you are 260 i'm beating you 275 you win it yeah yeah no problem you let me hey listen boss listen boss i mean whatever whatever you want for a 70 kilo guy how good was i good right
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, yeah, top, top 10, top 10. And top 10. Top 10, top 10 70 kilo guys that ever lived. Yeah, boy. Let's go. Okay, let's go. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Top 10's good, though. Do you have the video? Just find the video. Just let the community see how I flashed you. That was just a practice pool, man. That wasn't a real tournament, man. Yeah, okay, yeah. So it wasn't Harley Davidson tournament. Okay, yeah. Don't be bringing up the practice table. Practice? Just look at there. Your nose is growing up. Don't turn this way. You're going to crash the screen. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_00: Let's start. You were there when Brett Grundy beat Matt Mask. Yes. And you also saw Brett Grundy beating Paulo. Okay, where did you go again? Okay, guys.
SPEAKER_03: I don't understand why it does that. It's because somebody left me a voice message, sorry. Can you hear me now? Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_00: So you saw that match, and you saw him against Pablo. No doubt. And, yeah, you saw, right, the Pablo Supermatch? Yes. And I hang around Pablo when I'm in Chicago, so that was even more impressive than maybe people who don't know Pablo. Yeah, so you knew how strong he was. Yes. Yeah. Okay, one second. ProTechSaver says, did Travis just get Botox or...
SPEAKER_00: Is him not awake? Botox? Yeah. I don't know. I thought I looked good, motherfucker. What are you saying? Are you saying I look good? I said that you look good probably. Okay. So, okay. And now he's pulling Basho Saganashvili. Did you see, did you see Basho versus Reno match at the King of Table?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, Reno is super impressive. Reno just won the super, sorry, heavyweight world title. But, yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Is something wrong with your connection? Did you change your...
SPEAKER_03: purpose yeah i don't know it looks bad man oh you know what there is some oh maybe that is that good yeah now good yeah better yeah okay yeah because i did i did see some little sparkling light on was it filter it was filtering me i like it um okay so who's who's reading
SPEAKER_03: Who's winning? Yeah, to me, it's a mismatch. Bacho's going to just absolutely slaughter him. I mean, he's not going to be able to slow him down. It's going to be just one of, you know, it's just going to be one of them things. But Bacho is going to beat Bret? I think he's going. Do you think that Bacho can beat Pablo when Pablo is super awake? Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah. But, listen, I hope that I am wrong. What I want to find out is that Brad Grundy is a special. And he could be. He could be. Because, listen, coordinated. I mean, he looks really polished. But do you realize that, like, Matt Mask has won against Krasimir? No doubt. And you saw that, like,
SPEAKER_03: I don't think that was a very positive attitude Matt Mask in Florida. Okay. So you are saying that- What I noticed from Matt Mask was that he was preoccupied and his brain was all over the place when I saw him in Orlando. He was super light.
SPEAKER_03: And it doesn't take anything away from Brad. We don't even need to talk about Matt Mass. If he beat Matt Mass in a super match at E-First West the next day, it still would be awesome. It would be awesome. I think that Bacho, too, will beat Matt Mass. I believe that it is very difficult for an American arm wrestler to go from zero load
SPEAKER_00: Matt Mask is asking me a match against a high-ranked guy at 105, and he said that in a year, he will be either top or around top in 105. Do you see this possible? I do see it possible. I believe that Matt Mask was a very sick, injured right arm.
SPEAKER_03: And I think that he's a poster child. His rehab, stem cells, it actually 100% cured his pain. And now this fucking dude is on a mission. And I got a feeling that he'd love to pull Brad Grundy again. But we got to keep in mind that Brad Grundy could be the number one arm wrestler in the United States. He could be right there under Todd Hutchins.
SPEAKER_03: This is his first real, real match. You know what Tata Shin told me? Tata Shin told me that they trained together with Brett, and he said he couldn't do anything to him. Yeah, see, that's what I mean. All it takes is for Brad Grundy to beat Bacho, and that will trigger another match. Travis. Another match. He could be the guy. Jerome Moore says, Travis Engin, what's up, fellas? You remember, right, Jerome Moore? Oh, come on, man. Of course. Yeah. Hello, hello, Jerome. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's go to the next one. Jerome knew how to move. Jerome knew how to move around at that table, man. Yeah. Jerome Moore, hey, Jerome Moore trained with Barry Hurst. Now, Jerome Moore and Barry Hurst claim that they trained each other. I don't know who the coach was and who the student was, right? Both of them told me they were the coach and the other was the student.
SPEAKER_03: Doesn't matter which is true, but I ended up being trained, and I learned how to pull like Jerome and Barry. So there's a lot of history there with that guy, no doubt. Okay. I'm hoping Brad Grundy is what Todd Hutchings just said, and that means that, listen, we're looking for a number two man right now in the United States.
SPEAKER_00: We got a bunch of right, right, right now, right now we're gonna, we're gonna focus on the Tbilisi and then United States who is the rank. We will see. We have a lot of matches coming. I already, I already finalized the next events. Oh, and where are you going to Texas? Looks like, yeah, Robert, Robert would know that that is Robert's lane. I'm all about arm wrestling and I just don't want to.
SPEAKER_03: worry about other things. So we have Vasily Davutashvili versus Stoyan Goliamanov. Do you know Vasily? Yes. I mean, not well, but yes. But I do think that, you know, we don't know how good Stoyan is right now either. Like, this guy was good, but now he looks like he's a better version.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know, filled out. He looks more like Vitaly Lilletin from the shoulders down to his waist. And it used to be, oh, it got narrow and light and he doesn't look like that anymore. So I'm impressed with both of these guys. Both of these guys are big dudes when it comes to pulling in that weight class, or at least Stoyan always was at that 187. They both are very good top rollers. Yeah. Very good top rollers. Tall, big.
SPEAKER_03: I'm rooting for Stojan only because I have some history there. And it's awesome to see guys like him and Bobaev, you know, guys that are like me. You know, they're seeing if they can hang out with some of the younger guys. Okay, okay. What do you think? No, I'm organized.
SPEAKER_00: Travis, how about the hair transplantation for you? Oh, man, Alessio. Did you like it? Yeah, you're a different cat. I need it. I need it. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, 100%. What was I going to say? People say that there is a medicine, like Fina something, that they are using after this. I didn't use that one. People are asking me if I'm using. I heard that there are some side effects and things like that, so I didn't use it. Even the doctor suggested it. I can see you getting out of the bathtub, boy, walking up to that mirror and throwing that hair back, boy. Yeah, I will, yeah. You got the blowout. And the sunglasses.
SPEAKER_00: And what would that, what would that, how much does that cost for somebody? Uh, I don't know exactly. No, they, they just like, I just, uh, they just offer me or freaking and you need to find out the price, man. Cause listen, I shared the link and website. They can put it in. You ought to put it along with the VIP.
SPEAKER_03: Uh-huh. Oh, okay. Put it into the package. Hey, listen, would you be interested? Hell yeah. You can see, right? Do you want me to talk with them? Yeah. See what you can do here. You see all this? Okay. This little field in right here. That's all I need. I'm good on everywhere else. Yeah. Okay. I will ask them. Yeah. Anyway, so let's go. I see the guys. I mean, it's like headquarters because when I'm going back home, when I get to that airport,
SPEAKER_03: I see everybody who's, like, whatever they've been doing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Istanbul is, like, kind of like a center. Everyone is coming here, yeah. Let's go. Frank Lamparelli versus Serhii Kalnyshenko. Man, that's going to be good, man. I'm hoping that I'm not as bad as I thought I was and that Klitschinkov keeps on banging because he looked to me, like, very impressive against Georgie.
SPEAKER_03: to me he was very impressive even though he came up short um i think his dream of probably uh being the 253 champ is probably still alive in his brain um so i'm hoping that he handles frank um and then that'll make me feel a little bit better about where i was but uh besides that you know that thing's gonna be up high frank looks very comfortable you know frank is
SPEAKER_00: Probably one of the best topplers I have ever seen. About taking the wrist, the hand control is very, very good. Yeah. I mean, I think George, he's got, I mean, George, he's got extraordinary ability to compromise the hand and wrist and you know, man, your boy was all over it.
SPEAKER_00: so you know i think this is a great match and i hope that um and are they weighing 253 or whatever they want yeah yeah 253 yeah i mean i mean i think that karl nischenko is generally stronger but with frank with the that incredible hand control so i think we will see a battle yeah yeah i was impressed though i mean his hand too i mean okay he's pretty good yeah pretty good
SPEAKER_00: Let's go to another one. Incredible. I'm trying to start from just all of these matches are incredible. David Dadikian left arm with Alex Kurdesha. David Dadikian, people have seen him at 105, 231, but he is right now over 270 pounds.
SPEAKER_00: do you did you see or you missed that one that he pulled against morozov a supermaster of course yeah that's all right yeah yeah so that guy when he is he was there 114 kilos so he was about 255 yeah yeah 255 then and he almost beat morozov and now he's only 270 but the the also his opponent is very good like i think alexis left is
SPEAKER_03: about his rights, and how do you see this match? Yeah, I think that Alex just has to be really careful about Datacon's lane, because if he sucks them in there, it's going to be extended a lot further than normal. So it'll be interesting to see. You know, Alex has a lot of heart, too. So sometimes, you know, even I saw it with, I saw it with
SPEAKER_03: with the super heavyweights, the left-handed guys. Who was it? What's that? The champ, Artem and Matyshenko. What I saw is Matyshenko's lane, it would stretch out Artem in a good way. But then I saw when you have a lot of heart and you're the bigger guy,
SPEAKER_03: Sometimes you can hold on, even in that bad situation. And even though that guy's so in a good spot, his gas tank is draining from the bigger guy. So I fully expect Datacon to look really good early and most likely be up, maybe one to nothing, maybe even two to nothing. But I'm imagining that Alex still has his goal of being the left-handed world gauntlet champion.
SPEAKER_03: so if that is so then he's may just have to do it um and he's just gonna have to do it because he's a bigger guy and he's probably gonna have to pull in a hook and he's probably gonna have to lean forward and because if he if he tries to get away and he sinks it in datacon's dangerous and he's so mean so mean and aggressive um and i think that he's also he's also
SPEAKER_03: It almost seems like he's just such a warrior that has no problem with this, with how big Alex is. It's like more or less he got nothing to lose. He's going to be happy, full, and super aggressive. So I think early, early Datakon could take the lead, but I'm imagining Alex will hold on and win. It's no title, right? So just three to two.
SPEAKER_03: I'll say three to two with an epic comeback from Alex. Okay, let's go to Malin versus Fia. Man, this is good too. Like, I think that the weight, right? How much weight does Malin have to lose? I think she left like two kilos, like maximum four or five pounds left. Yeah, so the Malin... I mean, I hope that she does not hate me for saying this, but the Malin that...
SPEAKER_03: is pulling with the super heavyweights like that. I think it's probably, she has never been super heavy. She was just too big to make the one 43s or whatever that weight is that she looked to me like she needs to make one 54. Yeah. Right. So when she's having trouble making one 54 and not caring,
SPEAKER_03: and walks in there at 168 pounds, 170 pounds. God forgive me if I'm lying and I'm way off. But when she is bigger, that version of her, I believe, takes care of Fia no problem at Fia at 143 and 154. Now, when Malin has to be down there at the exact same weight as her, it's got to be close.
SPEAKER_03: Man, I don't know who's going to win this. I'm rooting for Malin just because, once again, have some history, right? 22 years. I've only known Sia since 2016. I think our whole community loves them both. And they both have a lot of respect. I think you got a lot of respect for how cool they are. And then you see how well they arm wrestle. Because it doesn't matter how well anyone arm wrestles.
SPEAKER_03: How they do at the after party and the pooling, it matters too. And those two are just, I hate to say it, they're just like one of the guys. So they're always hanging. And then, I mean, I see a tremendous amount of skill level. I don't know if two guys have any more skill level than those two girls when it comes to their education, their experience, their lineage.
SPEAKER_03: This is a good one. I mean, I wonder if there is some deep seated jealousy, you know, because I'm one of those guys that understands that as much as I love John Brzenk and I love Devin Laird and I love Dave Randall, there was also I wanted to be them. And that that jealousy was part of the reason why I tried my best.
SPEAKER_00: it's not jealousy it's normal that you want to become the best if they are the best guys of course you will want to beat them okay yeah i mean whatever you call it i wonder is there any place inside their brains that there is some animosity between there is there is i mean you you won't be you won't be a champion without that kind i mean you can be like totally like peaceful angel or something you know in a physical combat sport you know yeah that's what i believe
SPEAKER_03: Um, it would be interesting if like one of them just gets a little bit higher, goes a little, you know, just, just does something. And then we find out that, Hey, there is some, there is some. Okay. Okay. Let's go. I understand what you are saying. What do you think about Daniel Prokopchuk? Oh, I think he's absolutely phenomenal. And I don't think that he has any chance of winning.
SPEAKER_03: a match again. No, no way. No way. There's a, there's just like, listen, bet. Kelly is so much longer, so much longer. And there were positions that if that Kelly was not maybe the best left-handed guy on earth, pound for pound, like him,
SPEAKER_03: He's right in the mix. I don't care what anyone says. He's got some stupid commitment, joint power. I mean, he got it all. And there were times where he was in weird positions, and he dominated Oleg. Oleg is a problem from a connection standpoint. I don't believe that our guy's got a big enough frame. I mean, if he does, it's going to be the most exciting thing
SPEAKER_03: It's going to be, and it's going to be dangerous. Like, I don't know if Daniel's going to, he'll have to take a long break if he's able to pull through Zook's arm from the grip and the wrist positioning that he's going to have after they say go. And it would be, listen, if you tell me that Daniel just wrist curls this cat in. No, not wrist curls, but maybe supine is here and put the joint and stop and tire.
SPEAKER_00: with later rounds, who knows? I agree that Oleg is the favorite. Oleg is very, very strong. And Daniel's weight category is 77 kilo. He's the world champion in 77, while Oleg is in 85 kilo world champion.
SPEAKER_00: Daniel deserves this match. And Daniel is not going to come there 77 kilo. My guess, he will be about 180 pounds. He will come there. He's going to be awesome. And listen, any sort of a good match from Daniel will just push him further away from that. What is it? 77 kilogram? Yeah. Right. It'll push him.
SPEAKER_00: even further away from the competition, and a complete lack of a connection and him not even being close, I don't think it'll damage his reputation either. No, no, no. But listen, Daniel, very smart guy. You know that he's an orthopedic surgeon. You know, right? He's the dude, man. Yeah, he's a doctor, he's a surgeon, orthopedic, and he's a very, very smart guy. And I see his trainings.
SPEAKER_00: um he's for his age very smart and he knows a lot the anatomy and everything and like i wouldn't be surprised if he gives very very hard time to zog i wouldn't be sure i'm not saying he will but i wouldn't be surprised that like you can't really
SPEAKER_03: Like not count him or something, you know, just like, oh, this is a Vulcan in the park. Yeah. I just hate the fact that there could be such a leverage problem that we don't see the match. It just doesn't, it never, it never, you know, materializes. And cause I still know that that is not any sort of indictment. It's just a 100% size and leverage problem. Okay. Let's go to the next one. We have another left arm world title match.
SPEAKER_00: We have Oleg Petrenko versus Betkili Oniyani, 2-0-9, world title match. Yeah, I mean, I go back to how well... Can you just wait one second? I just saw a message. It says, any news about Ongarbev? My friend, Ongarbev had an elbow surgery after his match against Oleg Petrenko, and they moved a piece of bone. Ongarbev sent me the photo of it. And...
SPEAKER_00: He's getting ready, but he's not ready. But soon, I believe he will be pulling, just for your information. About Samusha, guys, Samusha, he said that, Engin, I needed a little break, and he's going to skip this next event, but he's going to be pulling one after, you know, later events. Yeah, go ahead, Travis.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I go back to how well Petrenko pulled Alijan Murado. Of course. Now, you got to be careful. Okay, question for you. Did Petrenko give better match to Alijan than Matushenko gave? Or...
SPEAKER_03: well yeah no doubt no doubt but every time that i in the past would bring it up as well i think the alijan that matushenko pool was stronger than the alijan that pulled petrenko no doubt but we also gotta imagine that um you know the alijan that pulled um that just pulled would have beat probably both of these guys at the same time because of the weight difference i mean it's not
SPEAKER_03: To me, Alijon is better now than ever. But if you just go with your eyes, him and Petrenko, they were really getting after it. So it depends on how you want to view how well Alijon was that day. Petrenko's dangerous, man. Yes, yes. Dangerous. So this is interesting. I have maybe a little unrealistic.
SPEAKER_03: maybe opinion of, of the Kelly. And to me, dude's dude's got a, dude's got a lot of ways to win. And, uh, he, he just like Dada Khan, they just seem overly aggressive and mean at the table, which to me is a plus plus, um, if you have that sort of attitude. So, um,
SPEAKER_03: We'll see. I mean, also, too, we got to think about, you know, we all imagine Petrenko's not the strongest he ever been because of what happened with him and Devin. But the truth is, he could have been the strongest he ever was, and that still happened with Devin. And if he's as strong as he was against Alijon, and Alijon is the same guy, which could be true, too, then Petrenko's, you know, he could be the favorite here. He could just be, you know...
SPEAKER_03: Because I look at that Kelly Kelly to me was he looked, you know, just bigger than Oleg. But I feel like that Petrenko and him will be will be close. And you think about where the match is. Everyone who's pulling a Georgian should be careful. Because I got a feeling that there has not been a training camp any harder in the history of the Georgia national team.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, just know that Badkili last a few years, most of the time he's in Spain. Not in Georgia, but yeah. But I got a feeling that just if you're going to get introduced in that country and you're from Georgia, I think that you got to anticipate that these guys are going to be ready, ready. Like, you know, Iraq like scares me to death because of the location.
SPEAKER_00: I have a question. Do you think that it is always an advantage, or sometimes it is too much pressure that the host country boy cannot handle the pressure? Both ways, and it all becomes it. Yeah, 100%, because you can't lie to yourself. So if you train harder than you ever did because of it, then it matters. That's the advantage, right? If you don't train as hard as you should,
SPEAKER_03: It is a severe mind problem. And you know that you didn't give it and you didn't push it to that to that weird place. So to me, that is just me speaking personally. You know, maybe other people always go hard. But to me, as soon as you find a different reason to go hard, you know, and I think that if you're Georgian, I mean, from what I heard, the Georgians were in full
SPEAKER_00: Every Georgian in New York and Delaware was in New Jersey at that match that you had. They are very patriotic people. Tell me, how big will the arena be and how many people will be watching? My guess, these are all Robert Lane and he knows better, but my guess is about 1,500 people. And I will tell you something.
SPEAKER_00: In one and a half day, there was more tickets sold than any of the events we had on the competition day. I mean, like whatever we had the biggest number in the venue, more tickets already sold in one and a half day. After the tickets were, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: yeah i'm dude i'm telling you man one of these days i am going to bring the east first west to chicago for the weekend yeah i know listen i know yeah i gotta you know me i gotta make sure it's profitable for me too so i'm i'm pulling every little string and when i hit
SPEAKER_03: Boy, I mean, Robert is your guy to talk, you know, I'm happy that you're clear. Did you clear my travel to Boise yet? Or are we still going to work on that soon? We will talk with you. Yeah. Why are you laughing? I'm laughing at that. I'm laughing at that. That flow you got up there. I saw a little bit of air, a little bit of air just got under that hair. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: You're flowing. You're in the flow, though. Benji. Benji says, two legends, my brothers. Honored to know you and appreciate what you do for the sport. Thank you, Benji. And you are... We got to make sure Benji's safe, Ingen. He's in California right now where it's burning up. We got to make sure Benji's all right. Benji, listen. When you say, like, California, it is, I think...
SPEAKER_00: Not the whole California, as far as I know. Well, it's in L.A. This man's in L.A., so he needs to give us a thumbs up that he's all good. Yeah, yeah. I think he's good, and he's already right in here. Okay, so let's go. Let's go.
SPEAKER_00: Irakli Zerakashvili versus Tata Shins. I'm very curious about your opinion. Yeah, I mean, listen, Todd's got to be careful, man, here. Todd's got to, because I don't think Todd has worked on one thing except getting stronger at what Todd does. No, not really. Not really. Listen, this guy started arm wrestling very late. You and I, we both know. At mid-30s, he started. Yep.
SPEAKER_00: You know that if you didn't start arm wrestling while you're a teenager, you're like, how do you call that? Motor ability? Like, you can't really be so smooth at the table. After a certain age, things are not getting so smooth. Like, all those guys that started late, like Tim Breslin is strong, but he is not really, like...
SPEAKER_00: you know this type of guy but you know more like static type of guys but tatashins trust me he knows what he's doing he knows what he's doing he is very very
SPEAKER_00: smart guy, just go watch his matches with Ongarbev, go watch his match with Kanae, the last event. Trust me, he knows, he knows like for, like if you want to become a very, very good armwrestler, I mean, you really need to know all those muscle groups and things like that. Maybe for you, it was explosive. Suddenly you were doing a perfect move. But during the match, once it stops, like, I mean, what I saw,
SPEAKER_00: God knows, but he doesn't have that, as I said, you know, that smoothness in the technique. But just think this way. Compare Dadikyan versus Tata Sings and Dadikyan versus Irakli. Yeah. Irakli, Irakli, Irakli. Irakli has been winning. Go ahead.
SPEAKER_00: Go ahead. Irakli has been winning in 95 kilo. Is that only because he became so different or because 105 category was something else? Do you understand? Of course. And what is the weight? What's their weight? 95 kilo, 209. So what I just say that, listen, I have been the organizer of these events, right? Todd Hutchings, even when he comes to
SPEAKER_00: 105 category, he's coming at maximum 100 kilo. He's 220. He's coming 220. Like, Dadikyan was 231, probably he ended up 245. You understand what I'm saying? At least. So, right now, they're making 95 kilo. But from the other side, also, Iraqli, a lot of times, even when you pull
SPEAKER_00: 105, he was not really 105 either. You know, he was around like 220. So I think this is their category. I don't think that there will be any power loss because of making weight for neither of the athletes. Okay, just I'm listening what you say. Yeah, yeah. I think that if you just look at Araklé and Todd, it becomes the easiest thing in the world, right? Araklé is getting a rematch that, you know,
SPEAKER_03: You can argue whether it's even a good rematch because it was so, in my opinion, everything was done. Todd took care of that, right? But then you see Irakli on his little win streak, and then you think about the fact that he knows what he's getting involved in, and he's doing it in his home country. Man, I'm telling you, he's going to be awesome.
SPEAKER_00: Orakle is 100% going to be the very, very, very, 100% best. And he's not blinded at all. But his opponent is also someone who is extraordinary and smart. And I don't think that Todd will be intimidated.
SPEAKER_03: And no one's a bigger Todd Hutchings fan than me. I am telling you now upset alert right now, Iraq lay is going 100% to be a problem.
SPEAKER_00: He is going to be a problem. Everyone knows that you don't have to be a genius or you don't have to be Einstein. Yeah. I mean, listen, listen, listen, listen. It actually to be a hundred percent problem. Like it's, of course, nobody is expecting Todd to walk in the park or something, you know? I mean, I think you'd be surprised. I think you'd be surprised at how many people think he's going to win. Oh, okay. Now you said something different.
SPEAKER_00: being a problem is of course you know like listen can i was a problem for touching can you say that he wasn't a problem he was a problem so but now when you say that he's gonna win now you are saying something more clear okay yeah upset alert i'm telling you ding ding ding there is not a better todd hutchings supporter no one believes in that man more than me i'm telling you that if you
SPEAKER_03: you could watch Rocky one, Rocky two, and start to imagine what happens in Rocky three. And when they start off the movie and everything is set up, you understand that
SPEAKER_03: The sequence of events and when this match is happening is a potential problem for Todd Hutchings. I mean, he's never been to Buglisi, first of all. So he's traveling, not going to Istanbul. And listen, it's just like one and a half hours more travel. Just one and a half hours more travel. No, no, no. He don't know what hotel room. He don't know what bed. I'm telling you.
SPEAKER_03: Is Orakule going to sleep in his own bed? How far does he have to travel to the tournament? Oh, he's going to stay in his home, you know. Oh, my goodness. What? Oh, man. Listen, I'm telling you, I don't want it to happen. My prediction is there's your upset.
SPEAKER_00: And I don't know if you consider it an upset. Listen, this guy is already a champion, you know, in the category. There is no upset. Whoever wins. Well, a little bit. Listen, listen, listen. I don't think there is anything upset, you know. Like, I will not be. I see it. Has anyone but me predicted a raclette is going to win in this whole world? Yeah. Tell me another part. A lot of people.
SPEAKER_03: A lot, you know, like, I mean, just watch the podcast, you know, like, I mean, I need somebody listening to me and you to tell me that they think that Iraq lay is going to be taught us. I don't think you're going to find it. I think that those people all believe 100% that Todd Hutchings will win the United States. It's not even close because of what they saw before.
SPEAKER_03: Irakli is already champion in this category. If he wins one more, if he defeats Tatachins, he will be the permanent owner of the belt. You can't even get him to say it when I begged him to say it. They'll say it's going to be close. I could see it, but no one's like, yes. Oh, here we go. Joel, thank you, Joel. Irakli wins 4-0. Woo!
SPEAKER_03: Well, you know one thing's for sure. Like, if he gets the hand and wrist position that allows him to smash him sideways, then it will be a rinse and repeat. There ain't no doubt about that. I just think that, man, that Todd took this match in that man's home country on a rematch that he was so dominant. I mean, man, everything leads to the upset. Upset.
SPEAKER_00: Listen, you guys are... Todd, come on, Todd. Your Americans are, how to say, you have that kind of Rocky IV like spirit, you know, that to go into an Eastern country and then going there and... Well, yeah, that's the deal. It's not Rocky going in there. It's Apollo Creed, right? Because of how overconfident... You see, Todd, I think he's not...
SPEAKER_00: He could be. He could be. If he was, if he would have lost to Aracleta last time and then he went there. Listen, Rakir didn't lose to the Dragon in the first one. There was nothing. No, no, no. It doesn't have to be the same thing. The story here, you're going to Tbilisi. Tbilisi is Lion's Den. You know, like Lion's Den, right? I'm saying Aracleta is the third most
SPEAKER_03: biggest name, maybe fourth. Him and Gennady are tied for third and fourth of the biggest arm wrestling names in Georgia. Like, when they get called out, Araklay is putting his entire... I mean, you talk about pressure for him to accept this match in his home country against the guy that he was not that competitive with a year and a half ago. And you can hear the confidence. Like,
SPEAKER_03: Todd, even though Todd's I'm sure just playing it up for the podcast and the social media, but he more or less, I mean, he's telling you he's going to kill him. There's, this is crazy for a Rackley's brand in country. Listen, you are just saying that only, only, only you are talking about only like psychology aspect, you know, and then if you lose in your country and this,
SPEAKER_00: Listen, that doesn't work. You have an arm. It needs to hold on. So you're going to win. No matter how ready you are here, you really need to be ready here as well. So if Rakli is strong enough here, he's going to win. If he's not, he's going to lose. The same for Todd Hutchings. You are so much focused on...
SPEAKER_00: like the psychology, you know, oh, if I lose in my country and this and that, yeah, yeah, I understand. But I think the boat will be ready mentally. Todd is also very strong in his head. Huge, huge, huge upset if Todd Hutchings loses.
SPEAKER_00: It does not matter. Just run the poll. Run the poll. The guy is a champion. You know, how can he be, how can there be a huge opportunity? Just run the poll. Run the poll, and I'll bet you it's 95 to 5, says Todd. I will make a community post. 95 to 5, you're out of your mind. You're out of your mind. As long as you don't post this podcast of me saying that. No, no, no, no. I will just do, because podcast is just a few hundred people, 400 people watching. But what I'm just saying, I will do a community post.
SPEAKER_00: poll, and then you will see there will be probably around 10,000 people. And if it goes 95 to 5 for Todd Hutchings, I will just make a public video and just say, Travis, I mean, I don't know. That's all I could ever ask for. Anything. But if it doesn't go 95 to 5, would you do the same? Even I give you the 85 to 50. I'm a little worried about you being in control of the poll and stuff. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Are you serious? It's going to be overwhelming. It will be an overwhelming advantage. I mean, what are you forgetting? 70-30? 70-30? 80-20? I mean, yeah, maybe 70-30, but listen, I won't be surprised if it's in Irakli's favor. Oh, man. Well, let's have a friendly wager on that. I will make the post, and then we will see. Okay, this map, Rosian, I am so impressed how well Travis knows every athlete, even the beginners.
SPEAKER_00: Lots of respect. But we're beginners. Okay, thank you for that. At the East, we don't have a beginner. Don't give me too much credit. The boss don't play that. Don't give me too much credit now. No, it's not because of that. I'm just curious, who is the beginner that you know? Hey, where is Vresh? I want to see Vresh and Daniel. Yes, yes, yes. Me too, me too. Everything will happen. Everything is at time. We can't do all of them at once.
SPEAKER_00: and yeah okay let's let's go to the next one let's go to the next one and let's talk about michael todd versus hermes casparini say it again michael todd versus hermes casparini i cannot even believe that this card is what it is oh my goodness i mean
SPEAKER_03: I hope, man, I hope Michael Todd, man, I hope Michael Todd stops this match. It's gonna be hard for him to stop it, man. It's gonna be hard for him to stop it. I'm going three to one, monster Michael Todd. Three to one. What to one?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I'm sorry. Four to one. How do you see the match? I see 13 minutes. Ready, go. And now what's happening in the strap? 13 minutes of arm wrestling between goes, fouls. When the dust clears after that 12, 13 minutes, it's one to one. With about eight starts between all the
SPEAKER_03: the problems, and then Michael Todd being in control after that and wins 3-1. It's going to be great. This is going to be great. I'm not really asking, you know, like about score or something, but how technically the breakdown of the match. Yeah, I think that... Who is losing wrist? Yeah, I think Hermes will get some hand and wrist control. Michael will go down here and Hermes will get to a position where
SPEAKER_03: is able to pin Michael, but there's a little confusion as to whether his elbow is on or off the back of that mat. There'll be a couple conferences, a couple false starts, and then Hermes will run out of gas, Michael Todd will hold on, and then by the end, boom! Here comes the mighty press for match three. But it'll take a while. But I just think that if
SPEAKER_03: If Michael is in this match, it'll be that army protects his elbow. Doesn't have enough side pressure to pin him. Sloppy because he can't pin him. Gets a little unprotective of his elbow a little in front of it is able to pin him, but not keep his, his elbow on the back of the pad. So when the dust clears three to one Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_00: And that has got a lot of USA. So you are saying that Levan's next match will be Michael Todd? I am, yeah. So we will see Levan Saginashvili versus Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, unless you're going to give Vitaly his rightful title. No, Michael told if he wins, he wants his next match. Of course. Listen, what Michael wants and what should happen could be two different things. Listen, we already talked. I already gave my word to Hermes and Michael. And I gave my word that the winner of Michael and Gennady match
SPEAKER_00: was going to pull Hermes and Winrow, that match was going to pull Levan. So, you know, when I gave my words, you know, I mean, unless there is a good reason that I can talk and then try to convince that this is what happened, you know, and yeah. Hermes could win and have a little bit of a shoulder elbow problem.
SPEAKER_03: and Vitaly have to step in for him. Yeah, yeah, this is what's going to happen. Listen, listen. I like Ermi's rematch with LeVon and I really like Michael Todd with LeVon. So I'm okay with that too. I just think that it would behoove our community to keep LeVon as busy as we could possibly keep him busy. I mean, if Michael is ready by the time that LeVon is pulling, it's going to be Michael. And if not,
SPEAKER_00: Then it's going to be, we tell you, but if this is only if Michael beats Hermes, as you believe. Well, we just flip and we know it would be Hermes and Levan then. I mean, I mean, Hermes means Hermes wants to pull Levan as his second match, Levan's second match over the years, not the first one. So in that case, and then Laletin. There we go. Yeah. It doesn't matter to me who wins then, because I would love to see
SPEAKER_03: from what that conversation you're telling me, if, if Hermes wins, we might see Vitaly. And if Michael Todd wins, we'll see Michael Todd and then Vitaly. So it's not bad either way. Definitely not bad. Okay. Cause you didn't, I mean, we needed, uh, Jerry doesn't can't put up a fight in such a losing position as Michael Todd could potentially attempt to do.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Right. I mean, that's why we're wanting to, that's why we're okay with the match. Hey, what if Todd, what if Michael Todd is dominant? He dominates. Just imagine if he sets back and he can't pin him the first round that not pinning Michael on round one is a different thing.
SPEAKER_00: Michael to Stonewall, Hermes, like you just showed, is a different thing. If that happens, if that happens, the Michael Todd versus Levan match will be very, very, very… Oh, man. We're going to get behind him anyway because I'm telling you, there is no better suitor. There is no better suitor for underdog status than Michael Todd. Listen, I mean, I'm expecting a tough match. I don't believe anyone is Stonewall anyone, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I don't believe, yeah. I mean, I think it's going to be a tough match. Oh, man. Can you see Michael's face if he does something early? Oh, man. He's going to be fired up, boy. Okay. One guy is probably joking. He said, I'm so excited about King of the Table in Georgia. I have already booked my flight to Atlanta. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not aware of what that was. There must be a direct flight from Atlanta. I think he's joking because the event is in Georgia and
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. He didn't know that one guy, he bought tickets, he bought tickets, and then he sent a message. He said, I thought he was in Georgia State. Can I refund the tickets? Really, really? I'm not joking. Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. Anyway, so let's go. Devon Larratt versus Gennady Kvikvinian. Yeah. I will tell you first what I think. I'm not going to do predictions. But
SPEAKER_00: I know 100% sure that Gennady is making a comeback. And as I say all the time, that when you are training all the time, three and a half months is not really like, I mean, it's a good time to get ready, but when you are making a comeback, every month means a lot.
SPEAKER_00: Do you understand what I'm saying? Because you have been away. So it is not like somebody training every day and then has three and a half months. But if you didn't train for more than one year and you're making a comeback, every month you will... Because you are not trying to reach somewhere that you have never reached. You are trying to come back to...
SPEAKER_00: level that you have been before, so it is easier to come back. So I have no doubt that Gennady will be in a stronger shape than when he pulled against Michael. And also, Gennady, I think that part, the event being in Tbilisi, having an advantage, I think that is a huge factor for Gennady, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: But still, I remember when I asked Gennady, his best shape ever was when he beat Devin. And now, he needs to be at least at that shape. Again, my opinion. So on the paper, when I look at this, I see Devin's favourites. But yesterday, I had a podcast and there I said I want to repeat again. When you are talking about Gennady Kvikminia,
SPEAKER_00: the math doesn't work like two plus two four or something because Gennady Kvigvinia is one of those guys that can really push his potential limits a lot of people are limited because they limit themselves they think that they they calculate everything but Gennady is like boundless and so you don't know what to expect you may think that way on the paper but something else
SPEAKER_03: may happen, but on the paper, my opinion, I said this to Gennady as well, Devon is favorites. Okay, now I want to listen what you are thinking. Yeah, I just think that coming off the injury, you can get back to form, but you can't get back to that warrior. The length of endurance and the cost of re-injuring seems way too dramatic.
SPEAKER_03: for him to be he could be as strong as he was when he beat devon but he's prepared to i mean that was brutal that was a brutal five five rounder or whatever it was so i mean i just think that uh i think devon's better than he was that day and that gannati is nowhere um is nowhere near the warrior
SPEAKER_03: because of the setback injury-wise. So to me, it's not really close. I'm just hoping that the match is even interesting. And that interesting part, really, it comes to Gennady's showmanship and then how much heart can he lay out there, especially in his home country. Travis, do you believe that Gennady is coming there in his mind that he's losing?
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I hope not. I hope not. I guarantee you. I guarantee you. I did an interview with him in Tbilisi. I also talked with him privately. The guy is not coming there to lose. That is the dangerous part. And the thing is that when I also had a podcast with them together, when Devin was doing his games, it didn't really affect Gennady.
SPEAKER_00: So I don't exactly know who has the psychological advantage right now. I thought at the beginning was Devon, but right now I don't think that Devon has psychological advantage. I'm not saying Gennady has either, but I think that mentally they are both ready for this match. Gennady is not coming there to lose. Yeah. Hey, listen, from a business standpoint, let's go Gennady. But
SPEAKER_03: You know, I mean, I think Devin losing. From business points, Gennady? Yeah, just from a promotional. Well, because we know that Devin has the ability to sink weights, but we are starting to get, you know, it's a little scarce up there at the top. We would love for Gennady and Devin for that. Once Devin becomes the second best super heavyweight, and then the first best one, 253, and the best 231,
SPEAKER_03: That's a little lonely. We need him to have trouble at the very top of that super heavyweight division. What better show could you want than for Gennady to win this match and look out at his countrymen with his hands in the air screaming some loud Viking type? I mean, that place will, I mean, you can have, do you have confetti and balloons prepared for that? I hope you do.
SPEAKER_03: because it will be amazing for arm wrestling from a spending $20. And that being the final, because maybe I'm wrong, but unless you're from the country of Georgia,
SPEAKER_03: You think Devin Laird's going to win this match. That's just a fact. Now, you can factor in that they don't have as much knowledge or input as you do because you've been to Buglisi. You've been interviewing the guy. From the regular guy looking in, that Devin and Gennady match, they're getting dressed to go out. They're getting their pajamas on.
SPEAKER_03: They're not, you know, the card ends before that match. Travis, do you know why we are having this podcast with you? Because two knowledgeable guys, we are sharing what we know with the community. Yeah. Yeah. I just, listen, I think the community thinks that Devin's going to win this match as much, if not more, than they think that Todd Hutchins is going to win the match.
SPEAKER_00: I think Irakli has a better chance of cracking Todd Hutchins than Gennady does of cracking Devin. Travis, this match, I think I said this match two months before the event, Gennady versus Devin match, and which was, I think, one and a half months after the East versus 15. I thought that after him losing, Gennady losing, I thought that he...
SPEAKER_00: was not active and he had only two months because like we didn't know which match to set you know yeah and when i went to tbilisi after i said this match and it wasn't the case the guy whatever time he had he continued training um he well let's let's let's talk about this let's talk about the fact that michael todd and ermys that match will happen before gennady and devon correct
SPEAKER_03: I will decide that, yeah. I will decide. We will see. Okay, because let's think about this. If you see if Michael Todd gets crushed by Hermes, right, that will make you think even less of Gennady's performance with Michael Todd. If Michael Todd stonewalls Hermes in the first round, all of a sudden a guy like me starts, oh, shit.
SPEAKER_03: Truth is, Michael Todd is at a weird level and Gennady was all over his ass. So now, to me, those matches matter on how I'm going to judge the next match once I see them two. If Devin just crushes Gennady, it's going to make me think that Hermes has a chance of crushing Michael Todd. If the better Gennady pulls against Devin...
SPEAKER_00: We just don't know, Travis. We just don't know their shape, if they were as good as the last time. We don't know if Michael is going to be better than last time or the same, or if Kennedy will be the same or better, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I would just be patient and not to come to a conclusion while I'm watching those matches. You only need to be patient another 15, 20 minutes and you will find out what's happening. But you are saying that the athletes will have those kind of thoughts in their mind? Of course. Why wouldn't they?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, there's no reason not to. Yeah, I mean, if we find out that Michael Todd... We can't, we can't really, we can't really depend. If we discover Michael Todd on a two or three match win streak beats Levon, you got to rewind this match with Gennady and be like, my goodness, do you know how strong Gennady was that day in Istanbul? And we, I don't know if we give him the right amount of credit right now.
SPEAKER_00: We'll find out. We can either find out by him pulling Devin first, or we can come to some pretty solid conclusions. Not solid, but we can have some opinions after watching Michael Todd. Listen, I will tell you something, Travis. Listen. Listen, the level of arm wrestling is just like it has never been. And this is not anymore like some entertainment matches. There are rankings. There are titles. And anyone who is going to Tbilisi,
SPEAKER_00: If I'm going to release it for a title match, I mean, I would go with a mind that, sorry, but I don't give a shit what happened right before my match. You understand? I don't give a shit. My psychology and my motivation cannot depend on any other match. I don't care what's happening before. I'm going there by believing in myself, and nothing that happens there is going to change
SPEAKER_00: my motivation. Oh, okay, I look at this match, next match is match, oh, okay, I'm going to lose. Or I look at this match, and then, oh, okay, I'm going to win. I don't care. I don't care what's happening there. I only care. Well, the truth is that this podcast ain't for the athletes, though. It's for the fans. No, no, what I am saying, if you are saying that it is going to affect the athlete's psychology, it just means that, like,
SPEAKER_03: they should have stronger. I'm not sure that it will. Let me go back and make sure that I don't know if it will affect the athletes. It will affect all the people watching. Okay. I understand that. Me personally, when I'm, if I'm, when I'm commentating and I catch a glimpse of
SPEAKER_00: one of these matches going sideways, meaning, to me, sideways would be Michael Todd stonewalling Ermias, round one and two, just boom, and then Zabel to pin him. You know, Travis, how long you have been in arm wrestling? 30 years? A little bit more? Yeah, me also, like, more than 30 years. I have seen these athletes in very good shape, not very good shape, and, like,
SPEAKER_00: Do you understand my point? Nothing that I see would create a conclusion. I know arm wrestling well enough. I am experienced and knowledgeable enough not to have... Yeah, you may have some, but it may not go as we expect. So when you say that we do this for the fans, but we are not going to say what fans...
SPEAKER_00: would think, but we are going to say what we think, and then that is how we can add something to the fans. Because we can't really repeat the most popular opinion, you understand? Yeah, they need the dialogue from their team on Thursday nights, they need the dialogue from their social media groups, and they need the dialogue from so-called experts. Well,
SPEAKER_03: That's what I am, a so-called expert. And I'm telling you that from my logical thinking, Devin's going to win pretty, pretty awesomely. And I think he can, you know, and I hope he can do it. So you are saying that he's going to dominate, generally? Yeah, yeah. I think he's going to be in charge and that he's going to cut off. Okay, another question is coming. Devin said that
SPEAKER_00: He's going to make Gennady quit. Is this an honest statement or that is a part of intimidation game? Yeah, I think that it's honestly, it's like it's a prediction that Devin almost does to every single person. Anyway, I've never... Listen, listen, listen. Round one, round one.
SPEAKER_00: Gennady and Devin, he was really like, quit, quit, quit. And then when the restart happened, and then whenever Gennady hit and his elbow came out, and then if you realize, Devin did not play games anymore. No doubt. He didn't really try to control or something. He really went- And I believe that was a mistake too. I think that Devin- No, no.
SPEAKER_03: No, are you talking about round one? No, when in round, I think it was round two that Devin just went straight and they went in there. Like, I think that that that that was like all fine and dandy. But the truth is, is Devin couldn't finish him.
SPEAKER_00: But the next two rounds, he beat him. He was winning 2-1. Yeah, but it was the way, like to me, that took a lot. It took a lot out of Devin. Do you know why? Because he wanted to control Gennady's pronator. Because once he went this way, and then he experienced Gennady's, that, you know, that
SPEAKER_03: He didn't, you know, shoulder pressure, whatever you call it. And he didn't want that to happen. He just wanted to cut the connection between Gennady's shoulders. I think that Devin will take a chance. I think Devin will take a chance on maybe talking a little too much too early with a little bit of control. And I wouldn't advise that, but I think that he definitely is going to attempt
SPEAKER_00: to talk to Gennady, drain him, yell. What does Opah mean? Opah? Opah, I don't know. But the question is that, my question, you said that Devin is going to win in a dominant fashion. My question is that if Devin somehow tries to play games, do you think that there is a possibility this match to end?
SPEAKER_00: as you are not expecting right now? Well, I mean, I think that he can make it harder. I don't think he can lose. I don't think that Devin can lose. So you are basically saying that if Devin goes right to the pin pad or he plays games, there is no way that he's losing this one. I don't think he's going to lose. He can definitely underestimate the heart
SPEAKER_03: and the in-match direction that Gennady takes. And he could be in a problem. He could have sticky moments. But, yeah, I think that he's getting better. And I think eventually Devin's going to get another crack at LeVon. And it's just going to be more interesting. And the truth is it was not that interesting.
SPEAKER_03: It was the most unbelievably interesting first round I have maybe ever been involved in. And in my opinion, the next go around will be interesting as well.
SPEAKER_00: Do you, okay, Levan said that his wrist was 75, 80% because he was coming from the injury, coming back from the injury, and he said that he wasn't sure about his wrist on round one. Later rounds, he won in a dominant fashion. Do you think that Levan is saying this because he doesn't want people to think that Devon stopped him, or do you think that he really says how it is?
SPEAKER_00: Are you frozen? Are you serious? Anyway, so... I think Travis is acting. He's just trying to deceive us. But he can do that very well. Travis, it's enough. You can move now.
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, guys. Yeah. Engin mentioned Levan. Travis dipped. Yeah, he is acting. He is acting. It's okay, Travis. Okay. Okay, you deceived all of us. You can move now. Anyways, guys. So, I will wait a minute. Travis to come back. And... And...
SPEAKER_00: If he doesn't come, we can end. It's always fun. Travis is one of the most knowledgeable person. And he's incredible with the commentating as well. Anyways, guys, I hope you enjoyed the podcast. It's always fun. I like to talk with Travis. Travis is never like
SPEAKER_00: I mean, political. He just says whatever he thinks. You agree with him or not, but it is always better to see the original than someone just telling what people like to hear. That is something very unique about Travis. Anyways, guys, looks like he's not coming.
SPEAKER_00: let me show you my bicep and forearm and then and then let me go and train let me go and train yes not bad the bicep is not there but the forearm not that bad you all take care of yourself
