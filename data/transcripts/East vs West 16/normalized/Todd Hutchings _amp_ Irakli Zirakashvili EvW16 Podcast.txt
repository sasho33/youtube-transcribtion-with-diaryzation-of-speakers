SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think we are live, I think. All right. So how is everything going? Everything's good. Good. How about you? Good, good. You still have your marker and then the board and doing calculations? If I need to. Yeah. And so how is the preparation?
SPEAKER_00: It's going well. It's tough, you know, at the end of the year to beginning of the year with work and everything. But no, in all honesty, it's progressing like I expected. So are you in better shape than previous events? I mean, you know, I make slight improvements to my max lifts continually.
SPEAKER_00: And they're going up a little. I mean, a few drag bags. So I'm as good or better than I have been. As well now. Yeah. So and you probably plan to be much better then. Yeah. I'm not so much worried about power and strength anymore. I have bigger problems with technique and skills than I do, you know, just generating the power of the endurance. So that's what I try to work on more often than not. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_04: Soon Irakli and our translator will come. Today we will have, I think, Roman. And then we can start, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Let me also quickly share the link on social media. So were you surprised about Kanai? I was. I mean, when I talked about it after the match, a lot of people said, yeah, he Kings moves all the time. And I don't know if I missed it prepping for it, but I was not prepared for him to Kings move.
SPEAKER_04: you know and travis goes oh yeah he does it all the time i'm going that i must have been watching like the wrong videos or something you know i can't believe you told me that you don't watch the arm wrestling videos so much except your own matches and now you watch the guy and you are telling me that you missed that i mean he's not right i mean he's just like this he never i don't think he goes like this but he's just like yeah but i i you know what i realized there i think that
SPEAKER_04: I almost saw you. Or I should say I saw you almost doing shoulder pressure. I was considering it. Yeah, because you were coming close. If you had it, maybe it would be easier. Hello. Yeah. Hello, Irakli. How are you? Good, good. You? Good. How are you, Fazila? How are you, Irakli?
SPEAKER_04: You turn the camera sideways. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. One minute. Yeah. It's good. Yeah. As long as you did it sideways, then everything is good. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: so exactly he he okay wait for roman then just because it won't be easy uh so what did you think about that match like what did you think like like like did you feel in any danger that you might lose the match you might have lost a match you know i was afraid of losing on fouls i know i wasn't after the first match no
SPEAKER_00: halfway into the second match i knew i wasn't going to get pinned i knew you know because anytime it came back to center i could come back at any time so i wasn't worried about getting pinned and usually i'm pretty aware of my elbow follows
SPEAKER_04: But they were calling fouls, and I'm going, I trust the refs when they say I followed, but I'm going, I don't think I followed. When you were just trying to rise, you know. Yeah. You know, yeah. Even I saw from far away, you know, not referee, but just like, I think that you had like, I mean, like if you are not in danger of losing, why would you?
SPEAKER_00: hurry up and move that sharp and then risk yourself to lose were you panicking that yeah maybe i wasn't panicking but i was my arm was blowing up and i know he was getting tired too yeah but but i was afraid i go man if i get to where i can't close my hand you know um so but towards the end i finally just calmed down and i just told myself i go just don't foul
SPEAKER_04: I don't care how long it takes, do not foul. Yeah. Hello, Roman. Welcome. Hello. Hello, guys. Yeah. Roman. Yes. Can you please translate to Irakli that talk just like 15 minutes nonstop, said how he's going to destroy Irakli and just put him on his arm on the... Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. But just, just, just add that it's a joke, joke, in our sense.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I don't know Georgian, but I can understand, yeah. Yeah, that's the fun part. As long as there is no toxic feelings, you know, just yeah, everything is fine, yeah. And Irakli, I have seen you, when did I see you? Three weeks ago, maybe? Like any improvements?
SPEAKER_01: Since then? Yes, it's been a long time since we've been together, and I don't know how we've been since then. It's been a long time since we've been together, and I don't know how we've been since then. It's been a long time since we've been together, and I don't know how we've been
SPEAKER_02: so so far he's not yet picked so throughout the preparation he tries to pick and since the last time you saw three weeks ago he was very good jape but now he's even better but not at his peak yet it's yet to arrive i understand and um i i share the
SPEAKER_04: post and I said you know Todd Hutchings says that he will he will like clean the floor with Irakli in fact Todd didn't say that but somebody made that and take Todd and Todd shares so I thought that Todd is in common feelings you know with it so and does what does Irakli think about that
SPEAKER_02: Yes, that's what I meant when you say that the post is empty, it's not the post of the whole world, it's the post of the whole world. It's empty, it's not the post of the whole world, it's not the post of the whole world. It's empty, it's not the post of the whole world. It's empty, it's not the post of the whole world. It's empty, it's not the post of the whole world.
SPEAKER_01: I don't want to say that it is a very difficult job, it is a very difficult job at a high level, and I think that it is a very difficult job that I have been working for three years.
SPEAKER_02: Anu, well, he's saying that, yeah, it's really good. It's great for the sports because such excitement and such kind of teasing posts, he's all welcome. But Todd, directly to you, he's saying that do not expect the guy who you beat last time. It's like...
SPEAKER_02: black to white difference this time it's completely oh i fully understand because he's a lot smaller now he's only 95 kilograms now he's a he's a lot tinier now yeah but a lot stronger
SPEAKER_04: We will find out. Todd, you always say that like 100 kilo elbow versus 100 kilo bicep. I understand that, but I'm sure a lot of people also understand. Can you explain what you mean by saying that you have 100 kilo elbow and your opponent has 120 kilo bicep? So you are basically saying that the bicep will not matter. This is what I understand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think side pressure overwhelms whatever you generate with your bicep. Between the two, whether it's side pressure or bicep pressure, I think the side pressure is more important. I myself ain't real. I'm very impressed with his bicep curling ability. I mean, to be up there banging with some Blinkoff and LeVon is amazing in and of itself. I just don't, I myself don't do any bicep curls. I don't think biceps are that, bicep curls are that helpful in arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_00: So I'm just taking a shot at somebody who's got a world record lift behind his back, you know, that I can't do. I mean, his bicep curls like 100 pounds heavier than mine. So 50 to 55 kilograms heavier than mine. So what he does with that bicep curl is impressive. I just don't think it helps in arm wrestling. I certainly doesn't think it's going to help a top roller.
SPEAKER_04: So basically you are saying that, Irakli, you would beat me in a lifting competition, but we are armwrestling and sorry. Yeah. I'm not even in the same class weightlifting. No, no, but are you also saying that, but we are armwrestling and sorry about it? Yeah. Okay. It was my part, but he approved, so tell him.
SPEAKER_02: I will translate it exactly how it was. I will translate it exactly how it was.
SPEAKER_02: Klaučičiu did not even try to use this biceps as a side pressure. This is why he did not use the biceps as a side pressure.
SPEAKER_02: I am very happy to say that it is possible. I am very happy to say that it is possible. I am very happy to say that it is possible. I am happy to say that it is possible.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, of course, everything is individual and it is not easy to do it yourself. There are many people who do not know what to do and what not to do. We have to do it ourselves and it is not easy for us to do it ourselves. We have to do it ourselves and it is not easy for us to do it.
SPEAKER_01: And that's why it's important to remember that the top roller is on the biceps and you don't want to lose it. The biceps are on the lower biceps. And the top roller has a very big advantage when it's in the lower part of the body and you want to lose it. The top roller is on the lower part of the body.
SPEAKER_02: So, Todd, he understood your point, but he wanted to share his own perspective on this subject. He said that each guy, each arm wrestler finds the ways of what would suit him, him or her the best way. So these curves, whatever I'm doing, I feel that it suits me and I use them during the
SPEAKER_02: matches so why not i'll just keep going improving on that one and then i i restated that i forgot to mention uh when you said todd that especially top roller you don't seem to use bicep like bicep would be not that much useful for top roll you said so i i don't know i think it's the opposite way did you not say that it is important for top roll
SPEAKER_02: No, I think your biceps or your barbell curl is not important for top rollers. Okay, not important. I translated and then Irakli said that actually what I'm doing is not like completely bicep, it's like in the middle of it. And he emphasized brachioradialis. Is it because of the end part? Exactly. And he said what I'm doing, actually, this is perfect for top roll. This is what he said.
SPEAKER_02: It just depends how you curl with bicep and what other muscles do you use. Well, I'm going to start top rolling because top rolling looks a lot easier than side pressure. So like lazier people can do it. So then we'll see how important it is.
SPEAKER_04: good luck it depends what kind of top is it if it is open on top row no no no i'm gonna top roll like john brzenk does yeah yeah yeah we will see we will see how it will be i i still believe like i have my own opinion without controlling thoughts pronator i don't think that anyone at that weight the same weight uh can
SPEAKER_04: beat him, that is my belief. The question, Todd, when you pull against Dadikyan, did you say that you couldn't slip to go strap? David you say that his hand was like strong? You just didn't want to risk it? You felt that way or you didn't even try? Yeah, the first time I tried slipping, I think he held on to me hard enough and was pushing me off the back of the pad.
SPEAKER_00: so and i was trying to slip kind of posting and what i really needed to do was do a more dragging slip but his his hit his hit into his press didn't feel that felt containable um his second and third hit felt uncontainable but yeah that's a match uh i would pull completely differently today so
SPEAKER_00: I'm a lot better at getting into the straps now than I was then, for sure.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, guys, that Super Chat thing has nothing to do, Super Chat option not to be available has nothing to do, me becoming rich and not needing the Super Chat money. There is a monetizing, temporary, temporary monetizing problem. It's not punishment, but it is some kind of transition on the Google AdSense. So just, yeah, that is not real, you know, thing. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_04: Okay. We did Irakli interview in Georgia, and he didn't talk big.
SPEAKER_04: He didn't say, I'm going to win. He said he will do his best. But he said that this is most important. I don't know if you watched the interview, Todd, no? Okay. And he said that it is because his family will be there, because he will be in Tbilisi for the first time. It is because of revenge.
SPEAKER_04: opportunity and it is because a title match and it is his third title match so if he wins he's gonna have the belt permanently so so did he said that this is uh the most important match of his life am i wrong can you quickly remind him quickly and then and then we have an approval yeah to iraqi right yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: Yes, sorry about that. Ira, your interview was very interesting, but I would like to ask you, what was the most important thing for you? What was the most important thing for you?
SPEAKER_02: Yep. Engin, Irakli kind of also understood what you were saying. So as I tried to translate, he said, yeah, yeah, I know. I understood what Engin said. Okay. Where did Todd go? He just disappeared as we were speaking with Irakli. I don't know. That's interesting. Yeah. Maybe he got scared what you just told him. I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: Roman, that's my job. You cannot tease the athletes, you know. You are a natural translator. Just joking. I love our Muslim brothers. Okay, well, ask Irakli, where does he think that Todd went?
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that maybe he's cancelling the match right now as we speak. Okay, Todd, we were just thinking that you wanted to cancel the match because once you heard that he said that this is the most important match and he thought that, you know, maybe you changed your mind about pulling him.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no, I'm looking forward to it because once I meet his family, I'll become their favorite arm wrestler too. There's no way that's going to happen.
SPEAKER_00: So you got to believe in miracles. It's a brand new year. Is it a miracle for you to beat him? No, it'll be a miracle if I become his family's favorite arm wrestler. Oh, okay. Okay. If I beat him again, it's just legacy.
SPEAKER_02: Go ahead. I'll translate it quickly. I'll say it again. If you want, you can talk about it. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want, you can talk about it. No, no. If you want
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I am a man of my word. I am a man of my word. I am a man of my word. I am a man of my word.
SPEAKER_02: So my family members, my entire family already respects you, Todd, regardless of what's going to happen in future. They respect you and this respect will stay there, especially they respect that the age of the armistice in this age as you are and still competing at a high level. Must have always been 35 years old.
SPEAKER_02: It's not a problem to talk about 25 years old, it's not a problem. His age has to be respected regardless. So he said that his family's respect towards Todzilla will remain. However, unfortunately for him, he's not going to win. That's what the rapper said.
SPEAKER_04: OK, that's interesting because a few weeks ago he was saying 50-50, but now he's saying for sure Todd is not going to win. And Todd is laughing about it. I'm curious about what Todd is thinking and laughing about this comment. I think I'm going to start top rolling February 15th. Oh.
SPEAKER_02: If that's the reason why you are coming here all the way from your hometown, that's not going to end up well for you. Well, I'm coming because the boss told me to, but I do look forward to it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but exactly. The first match he didn't top roll, but even when he was going sideways with pronation, maybe at the end you lost a little bit your wrist. A little bit. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think I've ever been to a place like that. I've never been to a place like that. I've never been to a place like that. I don't think I've ever been to a place like that. I don't think I've ever been to a place like that.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, Engin, you remember correctly. Basically, last time, Todd left me no chance. He took not only my wrist, I was unable to even feel my muscles properly. Also, my shoulder, I lost against him my shoulder, like shoulder gain, wrist, everything. So basically, he won without giving me any chance of laying to work. But I upgraded since then. For instance, Sasha also beat me in first match, and then I showed how much I progressed.
SPEAKER_02: I will show this time again that I have progressed and those mistakes will not happen again from my side.
SPEAKER_04: And Todd, you said you're going to show people that you start in top role from February 15. Is that because the way to beat Irakli is just make sure that you protect your pronator? And so by the top role, you are just securing that he doesn't control your pronator so you can apply the side pressure. It doesn't matter if you are successful to take his wrist or not.
SPEAKER_00: so you are making sure that you you still have your pronator is that so yeah i definitely have to protect my hand especially about all the tall especially against top rollers especially taller ones but top rolling just looks easier to me it's not all that work that hooking and side pressure does so it just looks like an easier way to spend the evening
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but don't you think that to top roll someone, you also need, like, a good wrist, really strong wrist, because you may try to top roll, but, like, it is, like, you think that it is better way to protect your wrist. Definitely need a strong wrist for a top roll, but the straps tend to help that out, too. Uh-huh. You don't need, your wrist doesn't need to be as strong if you're in the straps. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay. But, I mean, you're going to end up with strap anyways, you know.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, Irakli doesn't have a huge hand. He doesn't have that without the strap. I think you both really like the strap. Irakli, are you willing to go to directly strap or you want to start the match without strap?
SPEAKER_01: yeah he will try he will try without the straps yeah he will see where it leads yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's a fact like all of them
SPEAKER_04: Somebody did a good homework. Yeah, I did. Yeah, getting into the straps with Rockley is, I mean, even if I don't want to, he does. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He doesn't really control. But let's see how he will approach to this match. Yeah. And would you accept to go to strap if he wanted? Sure. He would go? Yeah. I mean, I would, but with his whole family there,
SPEAKER_00: Um, he might want to spend as much time as possible on the stage. So he might not want to go directly to straps because it just shortens up the time that his family gets to watch him compete. So go directly to the straps and the interest of efficiency and to make the event smoother. I will do that for you boss, but you'd better have him reconsidered.
SPEAKER_04: roman did you understand everything he said yeah yeah or you want me to a little bit remind you look like you were busy with chat or something but he said he said he would accept to go to strap directly just to make sure that you know event will be will not be longer than it should be but he said that iraqi
SPEAKER_04: wants to spend more time in the States so his family can see him longer. So he can try to, I mean, that is a heavy word, just translate it. That's what I was looking for.
SPEAKER_02: I'll make sure to translate this.
SPEAKER_01: I was very happy to be able to go to Canada. What did you want to do? Now I want to go to Canada.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I remember he said, I remember Todd was telling me exactly the same when he was preparing for his match against Kanah. Like his last match. Was it correct, Todd? You told him exactly the same? I might have said such a thing. So, Todd, how long do you think that the match is going to take?
SPEAKER_00: So that you thought that the step procedure process will be... To be honest, I don't think it really takes a long time. I think his longest matches are the ones with John. His matches tend to be fairly short. Whether he wins or loses, they're really not that long. So, yeah, the matches themselves won't be that long, I don't think. And then you will be ending up winning all those rounds? Yeah, I think that's the best way forward is just to win the first four.
SPEAKER_04: So you're going to beat him first four rounds and all together will take a minute or less? Probably four or five minutes. It'll be longer than my first match with Prudnik where the video is only like three or four minutes long. No, no. When I say five minutes, I'm talking about the actual one minute actual pulling time. No, no, no. It's probably four minutes actual pulling time. Oh, so it's going to be...
SPEAKER_04: It's going to be long. You're right. You're right. You're right. Probably two minutes. Probably 30 second matches. So every round you're going to beat him 30 seconds. Okay. 30 seconds is a fairly long time. Long time, long match. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what will happen to Odi in the future, I don't know what will happen to him in the future. I don't know what will happen to him in the future. I don't know what will happen to him in the future. I don't know what will happen to him in the future. I don't know what will happen to him in the future.
SPEAKER_02: it's it's good that it's great uh that you are planning to lose so fast thank you well if he thinks 30 seconds is a fast match that's we're both in for a rough day
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if we will be able to do it. There are a lot of Georgian fans in Mosul, and I don't know if we will be able to do it. I don't know if we will be able to do it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, to me, it's not that important how long the match will last. For me, it's important that it's in my hometown, Georgians will be there, and I must put the best show possible. I must put the best match possible. So that will be my whole point, main point, not only just finishing it in a specific amount of time. But does he have any comment on Taz said that he's going to win the first four rounds and secure the match?
SPEAKER_01: And what do you think about the fact that the first four songs were written in a different way? What do you think about that? Well, in terms of the lyrics, I think it's the same as the first four songs, but I think it's a different approach.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_02: It's all just his games to like hope himself up, like to build up hope inside himself because he's somehow, I guess, still trying to remember the feelings that he beat the guy the first time. But this time, once he grips up with me again, second time, all these thoughts that he's trying to use to build the hope inside him will just vanish instantly. And he will say that, oh, this is a different game now.
SPEAKER_01: So he's going to hold Irakli's hand and he's going to say, oh, shit. .
SPEAKER_01: I remember when I was in the 90s, I used to go to my parents' house and tell them that there was no one there. The first thing I did was go to my parents' house and tell them that there was no one there. I used to go to my parents' house and tell them that there was no one there.
SPEAKER_02: I thought he's reminding you, maybe you missed the detail when he was pulling Prudnik. Prior to the match against Prudnik, Prudnik was telling him that he would be just like working out his own wrist against Irakli like nothing once they would grip up.
SPEAKER_02: That was what Evgeny was promising. But then when actually they group up during the match, prior to the goal moment, Prunik felt Irakli's power. And Irakli also obviously himself knew that what Prunik was telling him was completely not true, so to say. And he said that in the video actually of their armwrestling match, you can tell that Prunik's face is just...
SPEAKER_02: changing that he's starting to smile a bit because he's feeling iraq's power right there and he was like oh basically basically iraq is saying that that will do the same yeah it will be evident for all in video on thor's face that his complete game will crash
SPEAKER_02: Well, it's completely possible. Fortunately for me, I have multiple games. This is the only game you have to try to hang on my hand like this way. That's the only game you have.
SPEAKER_02: Stop, stop BSing us. That's what you're up to. So, he cannot hook you, Irakli? Maybe with double hands. With two hands, maybe.
SPEAKER_01: I accept the offer. But for real, jokes aside, you can try one round, whichever round you want, like this. Like, try to curl me and pull me inside. You can try. Okay. It's a deal.
SPEAKER_02: regardless for you most likely in every way you will end up losing your hand but you're welcome to try yeah okay okay so iraq is saying he cannot hook him he cannot top roll him and only way to go is sideways he has only one way to okay he said this is uh the way i'm gonna fight he said
SPEAKER_04: Perfect. Todd, who would win? John or Kanai? Or close match? I mean, John's beat Kanai a few times before. And Kanai also beat him, I think, last time. But a few times they had a very tough match. But at this point...
SPEAKER_00: Like you pull John in Canada and you pull Kanai recently. Would you say that your shape against John was better than your shape against Kanai or? This is always hard for me because Yoshi and John each would pull me differently than they would pull each other. So my experience in these things never quite works out because what I feel out of both pullers,
SPEAKER_04: isn't what they feel against each other you know because yoshi and john would set up completely different but yoshi is gonna always pulls in an open arm you know way and then and maybe john will pull differently but they know each other and you felt their hand their power and you know how what john can do like yeah like not because only what he pulled against you but you guys trained probably a thousand times you know and and so how do you see would you see that a
SPEAKER_00: Like a match that could go either way? I still think John's hand is better than Yoshi's. Is it enough? You know, John does a lot with that hand. It would be the one thing that goes... I mean, I want to pick John to win this match. I really do. The issue is John's endurance has been pretty bad lately. You know?
SPEAKER_00: And the endurance John had when he pulled with Yoshi years ago, he doesn't have that endurance anymore. So a John that came in prepped, you know, for more endurance, longer matches. Yeah, he could do it, but that King's move, you know, if you can't pin them in a quick, if you know, if you'll, she can get in there and make those matches long.
SPEAKER_04: You know, every long match takes a lot more time. Can you say that John's shoulder pressure is better than yours? For sure, right? Because you don't really do it. But during the match with Yoshi, a few times you just came there. I thought you were doing it or you wanted to do it because you felt like that was the option. Or you just wanted to come closer to gain position for something else. But do you think that if you had very good shoulder pressure, you could beat Kanai easier?
SPEAKER_00: If I had better shoulder pressure, it would have helped me. What happened was I saw that as a lane and it was open, but I myself don't train or practice it enough. So I realized I was real unstable. And, um, and like I said, I wasn't worried about him being able to pull me back off center. So, you know, I just needed to like,
SPEAKER_04: wear him make the you know keep the match on with him on the losing side hoping he would eventually follow out is what is what i was doing at the while but did you have a few moments that you thought that i i wish i had like good shoulder pressure and just finish this thing on those moments could john finish him if he was in the same position
SPEAKER_00: Because John can do that, John. He can, and I'd love to say he could, but John threw a Rackley into a shoulder roll too. And Rackley dug his arm out and ended up beating John. And again, John's got the good shoulder pressure and stuff, but he's got to get his endurance up. I mean, John has all the skills in the world, but his strength drops off in a hurry when he's tired.
SPEAKER_00: And that's what happened with him in Iraq Lee was John had the better hand there. He actually hung into Iraq Lee's top row long enough to take it out and converted Iraq Lee into a oppressor. Um,
SPEAKER_00: John threw a Rockley into a press once. A Rockley is able to stop it, hold it there in the losing position for a while, and then come back. So John's got all the skills. He just needs more endurance. He needs more capacity. He needs more physical preparedness. So you are saying that if John will have enough endurance, he might be the favorite.
SPEAKER_00: Right now today, I think Yoshi would beat him right now today. Unless John, I haven't seen John since Florida. So unless he's been doing capacity and endurance training, you know, if John shows up, the John that was in Florida would probably lose to the Yoshi that I pulled just on endurance. That's the biggest hole. But you are saying that maybe fresh match, fresh round, he would win? I think the first round John would win.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if John would win match five, but I think John would win match one. If he wins, then even three rounds will be enough. Do you know why I'm saying- It'll look a lot like the John and the Rockley match. John was looking good. What was that? 3-2, I think. It went back and forth, and it was John's endurance was killing him. Yeah. Rockley, I have a question for you.
SPEAKER_04: Like, do you sometimes think that like you are training with Levan and sometimes if Levan is not in super shade, if Levan is a bit tired, you are giving him travel. Like, do you do any kind of calculation? Like, oh, like I'm even traveling Levan time to time. How can a 95 kilo guy can beat me? Or you are thinking that that is something different?
SPEAKER_02: Ira, when you and your so-called partner, Levan, met in Varji, I would like to ask you, were there any moments when Levan was in a certain form, in a certain way, when you were in Varji, when you were in a certain moment, and how did you feel at that moment when you felt that you were going to meet Levan? And in those moments, did you ever think that
SPEAKER_02: I would like to ask you, Levan, about your opinion on this issue, and I would also like to ask you, Khelso, do you think that a 45-kilogram barrel would be enough for you? Do you think this is the right thing to do? No, I don't think this is the right thing to do at all. I mean, I have been in Georgia for a long time, and Khelso has been in Georgia for a long time, and I haven't seen anything like this.
SPEAKER_01: The whole idea is that if you want to do something with Adrenaline, you have to do it. The whole idea is that you don't have to do it, but it doesn't mean that you don't have to do it. It doesn't mean that you have to do it.
SPEAKER_01: But I would like to say that the first thing that came to my mind when I saw it was that the people were mobilized and that they were going to die in the middle of it. They were not going to die, because they knew that they were going to die, and that's why I thought that they were going to die, and that's why I thought that they were going to die, and that's why I thought that they were going to die, and that's why I thought that they were going to die, and that's why I thought that they were going to die, and that's why I thought that they were going to die, and that's why I thought that they were going to die, and that's why I thought that they were going to die, and that's why I thought that they were going to die, and that's why I thought that they were going to die, and that's why I thought that they were going to die,
SPEAKER_02: Well, Andy, many people have seen me pulling Levan. Many people have told me personally also, and I can tell you almost 100% of them, they are telling me that I'm going to be totally easy. However, there has been zero second.
SPEAKER_02: throughout this preparation, since the last time he beat my ass, that I would think that I'm going to beat that guy easy. That's not the case. I'm never letting such thoughts to ruin my mindset of preparation. He doesn't want to get relaxed. He wants to say, I need to progress more, more, more. There is zero second of me underestimating Todd. I know what he's capable of. And especially coming from as a guy who got beaten, it is...
SPEAKER_02: not that easy to put myself in the mindset of okay last time he beat me but this time I'm gonna win easy it's it's not the case so yeah definitely even regardless of what I'm doing at the sparring sessions with Levan how easy I may
SPEAKER_04: pin here and there. No, I never let any thoughts of such things to ruin my mindset. Anyone who is weighing as much as Todd does and underestimating him is not a smart guy without any doubt.
SPEAKER_04: Last question before we go to the predictions. Todd, what are the big names that you have beaten? You know, like when I say big names, like super heavyweights and top guys. David you have a win against Cleve Dean? Yep. Yeah. And what was it, 2006, 2005? Yeah, somewhere between 2004, 2006. It was in Florida. I beat Cleve Dean and Dave Randall in the same tournament. Dave Randall as well, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: same tournament yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i remember it i top rolled clevedine just tell you luckily the guy who toppled clevedine just think what he would do to you about top
SPEAKER_02: I will thank him if he begins to top Roman. If that's his first game plan, I will just thank him. Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_04: Anyway, so let's go. Let's go. How do you see the match? Brett Grundy against Bacho Bacho Saginashvili? I've only met Brad once and it was in practice. I think Brad wins. Brad's got a very, very...
SPEAKER_00: Now, when I met Brad, it was a year or two ago. And to be honest, I thought he quit arm wrestling because he's going to go be heart transplants or do some surgery stuff. So the fact that he's back arm wrestling, I don't know what Brad... I talked with Chen Shou. Chen Shou said that Engin is ready. Okay. Well, then I'm trusting Chance. But the Brad Grundy I practice with, I have a lot of confidence in. His hand control is like he's pulling away...
SPEAKER_04: very good though i was very surprised when he pulled against matt mask i was like i mean like it was not winning but it was also the control there and i was very i couldn't do anything with him yeah what do you say i couldn't do anything with him in practice in practice wow wow iraqi bachelor versus bread but you're 100 wow
SPEAKER_02: That's interesting. And what does he think, Brett beating Matt Mask in the competition and also in training, Todd says that he couldn't do anything to him. And what I think is that Brett is in the same situation as Matt Mask. And even though he said that he wanted to spar with Brett, he didn't do anything.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so, Magda. There's no math in this, there's no science, there's no math. I think the answer is 10%.
SPEAKER_02: But his face was like so shocked when you said he kind of he's having a hard time to believe that you were unable to do anything against him. First of all, that's what he said. But also he moreover said against Matt Mask. We know Matt is good, but to beat Matt Mask cannot be like sensational. Something that would be considered as an advantage over Patrick.
SPEAKER_04: And he again, he was shocked when told Zilla said that he could not do anything, but he repeats. I don't believe he also repeated the bus. She's going to be 100% again, right? At the end. Okay, okay now I want to, I want to ask you Todd only.
SPEAKER_00: Fia versus Malin. 70 kilo world title match. Yeah, that's a tough one for me. That's like Rustam pulling Ruslan, right? I mean, aren't they basically sisters? They are not, but they are very close friends and they both are world champions. I'm picking Malin. I'm picking Rustam over Ruslan. I pick Malin to win. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And I'm going to ask only to Irakli this time. Vasily Dautashvili versus Stoyan Golemanov.
SPEAKER_04: I did a sparring session with Vasily and I was really happy what I have gotten from that sparring because I believe 60% to 40% Vasily is favored in this match. He was good. David he like Vasily's shape? Yes. Yeah, okay. Yeah, Vasily also said you are very strong, yeah. And not Vasily, but someone else said, never mind. And let's go with...
SPEAKER_04: Some other matches. Kurdecha versus Dadikyan. Left arm. You asking me? If you want. Dadikyan. Dadikyan is going to beat Kurdecha left arm? Yep. Okay. Do you have any base or your opinion for something? Or you just feel that way and say that way? I just feel that way. I can't really analyze the two of them. But
SPEAKER_00: I think, yeah, I think Dadikyan wins and I think he wins pretty decisively. Oh, interesting. David you know that Dadikyan will be over 270 pounds for this much? Well, I see he's in the super heavyweight category, but he could have probably pulled Kurdecha at the lighter weight. But no, someone told me that Dadikyan's really, really big these days. Yeah, yeah, he is, yeah. And Irakli, left arm? I think Dadikyan will win.
SPEAKER_01: He also thinks that he can win. He said,
SPEAKER_02: Dadikyan is pulling defensively also very good, even if you take his wrist and he's like in minus side, in his losing side, he still can pull effectively, from there can hold. And on the contrary, from Kurdecha's point, he's finding tough time to finish and he's just...
SPEAKER_04: leaving his hand open like this sometimes, he said. So because of this, Raktay believes Dadikyan will win. We don't know how is Dadikyan's elbow now. If any injury or something to hold like this, but we will see. Because we know that recently he had some left arm injuries, yeah. And yeah, let's go. Oh, Daniel Prokopchuk or Oleg Zhokh? Ah...
SPEAKER_00: Daniel Prokopchop is like one of my favorite arm wrestlers, but Oleg Zolk is a legend, so I don't want to pick one of those guys. So I pass. Let Rock Lee choose twice. How about having a technical, logical opinion instead of how much you love them?
SPEAKER_00: I think Oleg is an overwhelming favorite in that match. Daniel is my overwhelming favorite in all his matches. I'm biased. There's observational bias in my prediction. Okay. Irakli? 70% to 30% is Shokhi's favorite in America. Okay. That's it.
SPEAKER_01: And let's go with Betkili Onianii versus Oleg Betkiko. Good match? Good match. What's that? 50-50 or? No, I think Betkili is my favorite in this match. In 1995, I was in the 2nd or 3rd position. Betkili was my favorite in 1995.
SPEAKER_02: Well, in that match, had it been 105, Oleg would be favorite in my mind. But 95 kg, or that could be his favorite. And you follow these guys? Left arm matches? Me? I think it's Oleg. 45% to 40%.
SPEAKER_04: And I think 15% is up to the refs. So I think Oleg wins. What does that mean? These guys are like two of the least problematic guys with the referees. What does that mean with the referee? It only takes one missed elbow foul or one missed false start. Oh, so you are just saying the match is so close. Yeah. Okay. But I pick Oleg to win. Okay. Okay. I understand. Yeah. And Stergy Kalinichenko, Frank Lamparelli. Me?
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't matter. Irakli Usta. Let him go, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: he's saying 50 50 lamparelli seems really good uh top rolling uh armwrestler however maybe very little slight favorite is kalina but like it
SPEAKER_04: Then I asked him, so you're saying 51 to 49? And he was like, 50-50, but slight edge too. I believe that it's because of the hand control of Frank Lamparelli versus the horsepower of Sergi, so he's giving the edge to Sergi. I don't understand anything he says, but I know what it is, and he says the same thing. You understand better than I do. No, no. I pick Lamparelli...
SPEAKER_00: I think he's the favorite. Technically, I think they're pretty even. I agree with everybody there. But Lamparelli's got the proper attitude. Anybody that smiles that much has zero stress in his life. So he's not going to get worried or messed up. So I'm voting for the happy guy. His criterias are just so different than all of ours. He looks at the world with different things. Yeah, he sees a different world than we do, and I think that helps him. Yeah, yeah. Anyways, so...
SPEAKER_00: Michael Todd versus Ermes Gasparini. I'm not betting against Michael Todd anymore. I'm thinking Michael Todd. I think he's doing his homework. I think as he's become older, he studies more.
SPEAKER_00: But this is a match to me that could go 4-0 either way. And I still think it's 50-50, even after a 4-0 score. But I think Michael Todd wins. Michael Todd is going to win. Yeah. And Irakli? I'm Machid Zalian, Didi Power, Tim Gonia, Gasparini.
SPEAKER_04: I find Gasparini huge favorite in this match. Huge favorite. I think he's the favorite too. I just think Michael Todd wins. But then what you said, Todd, it means that you don't think he's favorite. You think he's favorite.
SPEAKER_00: to the most popular opinion, but not for you. Yeah, I think if you ran a poll who would win, I think Ermias, I think 75 to 90% of the votes would be for Ermias over Michael Todd. But that is not your favorite. That's not where you would watch. It's not my favorite. Favorite from the general opinion. I think the underdog wins this match. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: underdog dog uh according to the majority of the community but not underdog according to you no okay okay and then a question how how would you technically technically break down you know like the the mesh like like how how how is this gonna happen like is i think iranians are gonna top roll and michael todd's gonna kings move
SPEAKER_00: Okay, okay, but where they will end up? We know what they are going to do, but where the hand position will be? I think they'll end up with Ermes trying to desperately press at the end. I think Ermes' hand is really, really good, and it's strong. I don't know if it's big enough to stop Michael Todd in the center, and I think Michael Todd's going to hit that King's move anyway, so I think Ermes is going to be in a bad position for a King's move.
SPEAKER_04: for a Kingsburg defense. And do you think that if somehow Ermes takes Michael's wrist, he still cannot finish him? Because Genadi and Kami went this way, like when Michael had the wrist and they just tried to press his arm. But if Ermes takes his wrist, can he still not finish? Or in such case, he will finish? I think if Ermes takes his wrist,
SPEAKER_00: And he gets way out on his fingers. You might have the ability to pull the fingers down to pin him. You're talking about in the strap? In the strap. Oh, I think it's going to the strap. Okay, because when you show like this, I thought it was retouchable. Yeah, but those Kings movers don't always hold on. And especially East First refs don't put the strap on too tight.
SPEAKER_00: you can still end up climbing pretty high especially against you will he will he may climb and then finish okay in such case you can't finish him or in such case that um with the new king's move rule that prevents michael todd from getting high enough to prevent his fingers from touching but
SPEAKER_00: I don't think that's the name. That might happen once. I don't think it happens. Whatever. He's got to win. It's a title or? No, no, no. I don't think it happens three times. We have a guy. His name is Devon Saginashvili. He's from Georgia. Lives in Tbilisi.
SPEAKER_04: and really yeah he has the title so this this is not title match how long has he been pulling uh i like i haven't seen him around like for like 10 years well if i ever get a match with him i'll start researching him and then i'll then i'll know more yeah yeah yeah yeah are you better if you want the galmas you know
SPEAKER_04: I still remember you were like, ah, I want this. I said, this is for super heavyweight. And he said, ah, I don't care, you know, since I saw this beauty, you know, I may pull super heavyweight. Yeah, you said, yeah. Anyways, Irakli, Vitalii Laletin versus Artem Morozov, left arm. Vitalii Laletin, very big favorite. Very big favorite. And you thought...
SPEAKER_04: I agree he's the favorite. The underdog wins this one too. Morozov wins. Morozov wins. Is it like how you feel inside or you just want to be different? You want to say everything Irakli says, you want to say the opposite way because he's your opponent?
SPEAKER_04: Well, it's only because Irakli is always wrong, but it's not because he's my opponent. Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay. Because Irakli, when Irakli said he's gonna beat you, at that moment you realize that this guy doesn't know what he's talking about. Yeah, he's got to do more research. I don't think he knows who Uncle Todd is.
SPEAKER_02: I will quickly translate this. Look, this is what I wanted to say, and this is what I wanted to say, and this is what I wanted to say, and this is what I wanted to say, and this is what I wanted to say,
SPEAKER_04: Okay, let's go to the main event. Genadi Kvikvinia versus Devon. I think Devon's the heavy favorite and I don't think he loses a match.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, well, wait a second. Maybe the first one. Devon's usually, Devon's first match in every super match, he is sometimes close, sometimes he loses it. But I think Devon can King's move as well as Michael Todd. And Michael Todd's King's move gave Genadi trouble. So, and...
SPEAKER_00: See, with Devon, there's the arm wrestling match, then there's the talking match. And I think that talking match wears you out. So I don't know if Genadi is completely prepared for that. Oh, they went through it before. Yes, they did. Yeah, it'll be interesting.
SPEAKER_00: I actually think Genadi's got a better chance of beating Devon than he did Michael Todd because they pulled before. And Michael Todd's, I still think Devon wins, but I think it's a lot closer than it was last time. And Irakli, have you seen Genadi recently? I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: No, not for this matter. Okay. I wanted to ask you, what is your opinion on this? Well, I don't know how to say it. I don't know how to say it. I don't know how to say it.
SPEAKER_01: Well, in terms of form, I think it depends on the situation. I don't know how it will go, but I think it will go. I don't know how it will go, but I don't know how it will go.
SPEAKER_02: He would consider 50-50 this match this time. About Genadi, he said that recently he hasn't showed up at the sparring session, so I really can't tell how much, how well he has recovered from his injury.
SPEAKER_02: injury but obviously he had more time this time than he had it against Michael Todd so if Genadi did all his job great and if he feels uh good right now uh considering his injury then it would be great and also he said that we have seen surprises from Genadi so it's not gonna be uh any surprise if he wins either so he said beautifully
SPEAKER_04: okay okay guys but if you win this match against directly you want to continue pulling 95 kilo and to take care of an old business um yeah yeah leave me down here with these scrawny boys for a while let me pull the three of meagles after him and then we'll talk about my unfinished business in the other weight classes
SPEAKER_00: Oh, but you have some unfinished business in 95 as well. I got a question before we go. There's only 11 matches. Is there only one press conference? No, two. So Devon gets his own and then the other 10 matches are in the other press conference? That's a good one. Because it doesn't break my heart if I'm in a different press conference than Devon. I'm just telling you. You want to be in the first one? You want to be in the first one?
SPEAKER_00: Irakli can be in the press conference with Devon, and I'll be in the press conference without Devon. That would be fine. So you want him to be part one? Yeah. Okay, why is that? Devon's press conferences are exhausting. I get exhausted in Devon's conference. What's that? When I'm in a press conference with Devon, it's exhausting. Okay, so.
SPEAKER_00: But I was told that you are the biggest fan of his press conference. Nobody told you that. Devon's press conference should start a day earlier, and then when it's over, the rest of us could go.
SPEAKER_02: But once he enters Georgia, once Devon enters Georgia, he will be scared. So we should not expect him talking that much. Why would he be scared?
SPEAKER_04: Once he enters Georgia, because statistically Georgians are his limits, so he said, once he enters Georgia, he will be scared, so he will not talk that much. Okay, but just your opinion that because of stylistic thing, is that why he thinks that, you know, Devon will be scared? Or is it about all these things? Is I'm the king of Georgia or something?
SPEAKER_01: It's your responsibility to think about it, but why do you think about it? Is it because you think that Georgia is going to lose its independence? No, no, no, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. No, no, I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's all a joke. Devon has a huge amount of fans in Georgia and he said that it may not be a surprise if Devon's fans in Georgia are more than my fans. But he's obviously also joking. So then we made an agreement.
SPEAKER_04: In the press conference, Todd wants to be in the second part and then the tenth match right before the Devon's part in the press conference. Okay. All right? Works for me. Anyways, thank you, guys. Thank you, Irakli. Thank you, Todd. Do you guys have any last words to each other or that's fine? I look forward to seeing Georgia. I've never been there. And you, Irakli?
SPEAKER_01: I know you're coming here to take the belt and don't go empty-handed back in USA. However, unfortunately for you that's what's gonna happen that you would go empty-handed but
SPEAKER_02: I can also give you Nugo because he's talking nonstop about you. Nugo wants to match against you, Todd. So Nugo Chikadze, you can take him instead of the belt and then do sparring with him. He's talking about you nonstop. He wants to match against you. He said it multiple times. Well, he's got to take that up with the boss. I don't set the matches.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but Yuchi even tell me that he should ask me this instead of the belt. That doesn't sound good. Because that was, you are not going to take the belt, but instead you're going to take Nugo. So now you are saying, ask it about...
SPEAKER_04: about Nugo to Engi, it sounds like the second option is going to happen. You are going to leave the belt there. What's that? I'm very disappointed. No, no, no. I'm joking. He said Nugo wanted a match. I said I don't set the match. No, no. He said...
SPEAKER_04: Instead of, you're going to leave the belt here. And instead of that, you can take Nugo, he said. So it sounded like you are taking Nugo when you focus there, instead of saying that, no, I'm not leaving the belt there. I'm going to take with me, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I was just going to loan him the belt so he could still wear it and stuff. So I didn't have to carry it on the airplane. I was still going to own the belt. It was just on loan, like what they do with museums. Okay, that makes sense. I'm very inexperienced and young. So explain that part and we'll finish.
SPEAKER_02: No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_04: The belt is coming. Stay in there. He's staying there. He can guarantee that the belt is going to stay in there. Yeah. Good luck. Good luck. Take care, guys. Take care. Thank you very much, Roman. Thank you, Todd. Anytime, brother. Bye-bye.
