SPEAKER_02: Hello, hello, everyone. Yep. Anyways. Today I will have
SPEAKER_01: two of the best pullers in the world one is current very best and probably the strongest super heavyweight in the history and the other one is jerry cadaret another legend and
SPEAKER_01: probably when you say that that is shoulder pressure, uh, the best one in the history, Jerry Cadarets is the one that will come to your mind. You know, when you say top role, probably 10 different names will be mentioned in the history. But whenever you say,
SPEAKER_01: they had this shoulder pressure, then the name is obvious, that's Jerry Cadaret. So, very soon they will be coming and I feel a bit weird, you know, because I haven't done podcast for a while and I'm happy to be back.
SPEAKER_01: Let's see how it will go. I hope you all are doing well. I'm just sharing the link on social media so more people will be informed about the podcast.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, we are almost done and let me share in Instagram as well and then let's go.
SPEAKER_01: Normally, I only was able to reach Levan, but today, after I made the announcement, Jerry also replied. I wrote to both of them. Hello, hello, Levan. Hello. What is that? Listen, listen, listen. I mean, I mentioned this before, but I will mention again, you know.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how it is in your culture and belief, but, you know, you should never put your legs on the table. This is too big. Seriously, you look very big. How are you, Levan? Good, very good. Very good? Yeah. Tony K is coming or not?
SPEAKER_01: Tornike is now not in home. I hope he join later. Okay, that's good. Today, after I reached you, Jerry answered, because I asked you yesterday, I also asked to Jerry yesterday, but Jerry didn't see the message yesterday.
SPEAKER_01: And today he said, yeah, he would like to join. But I sent him the link. He still didn't see it. Yeah, but let's start. So how is everything, Levan, since the last match you pulled against Devon? How is everything? You came back from a serious injury and Devon was the first match. And now after seven months,
SPEAKER_01: How is your shape now compared to that time? My shape, I think, better. Better? Yes. When you say better, you mean stronger or healthier or both of them? I mean, like...
SPEAKER_03: wrist health wrist i have now i have a wrist strong strong stronger strongest wrist wrist in with the devil much i have some problems now it's in very good shape yeah
SPEAKER_03: Maybe not in best shape, but good shape. So you are saying that it's for sure better than when you pull against Devon? Yes, now I have some, I need to down some like five kilo.
SPEAKER_03: I 182 and I think it is too much for me. So you want to be 177? Yes, 178, 177. You do this all the time. Like right before the competition, you lose weight. And I think Irakli is doing the same way. Is it just to...
SPEAKER_01: have like better endurance or it is just you lose the water and you will avoid the pump or something like why you do that Levan exactly? This is for lose to water not very big pump and for
SPEAKER_03: At the table, I'm feeling better. When I lose some little bit weight, I feel more technically. Okay, I understand. Yeah, yeah. And when you lose this water, you don't lose power, right? Yeah, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_03: And how do you lose this water at the last moment? Doing cardio. And when I fly, my weight is always down like three kilos.
SPEAKER_01: And remember when I came and visited you in Tbilisi and the waist that you were lifting, do you lift now heavier or about the same? How is it? I ask because you were just coming back from injury and you just started training, like you didn't have very
SPEAKER_03: long time you know like to train and like how is it now um yes i for this much i try a lot a lot lot of and i take very big weights in one head i do
SPEAKER_03: biceps 150 kilo easy. 15 or 50? 15. 15. Yeah. Okay. One, one, five. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'm not too more because I'm not too... Not necessary. Yeah. Bench press 260.
SPEAKER_03: biceps with two hands 155 55 wow so these numbers are bigger than the time that i came to tbilisi wait so i i do for this preparation good weights good i think yeah
SPEAKER_01: By the way, hello. Hello, Tony. Hello, my friends. Good day. Good to see you. Good to see you. Yeah. Anyway, so we are waiting for Jerry to join as well. I don't know if he forgot or something, but yeah, let me give him one more ring and then we continue.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Levan, you told me, I don't know if I should say or not, but you told me, I'm not going to give any details, that you are going to do some specific training for Jerry. And I don't want to mention, remember we went to do the kickboxing or something fight? You said that you will do some small adjustments with your training.
SPEAKER_01: uh my question to you um whenever i remember uh like i offered jerry mesh to uh ohan jerry came good let me say hello to him and then we continue hello jerry away jerry you look like you are 500 pounds your face is seven away in wb 501 pounds okay to have this
SPEAKER_04: 20% a month, which we're... What's up, Lavan? How are you, my man? I'm good, thank you. Jerry, this phone is coming from you.
SPEAKER_01: i'll turn it down hold on it's just i'm not working but the sound is coming we are produce revenue yeah uh so you don't have any quieter place right we'll get what's not right per location over the next four days one a day
SPEAKER_01: Grab it from last month, next month. No, no, I'm just saying, do you have any other quieter place? One a day. Right now we are listening to your friends, I think. I'll get the noise gone. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so Levan, I will just say that whenever I offer the match to
SPEAKER_01: Alex Kurdecha about two years ago about Jerry, and he said that he needs a specific training and time for Jerry. And then finally, someday he accepted that match. And then you saw that he tried something different than what he usually does. And it didn't work against Jerry because he did something different and it just didn't work.
SPEAKER_01: so what i just tried stated alex is someone who is like totally outside full of top roller with left arm we saw him book side pressure even shoulder pressure but with right arm we saw him only totally pronation training and whenever he tried to adapt what what
SPEAKER_01: When I was training with Jerry, I was specially trained by him in Danube.
SPEAKER_00: And I understand that it is possible. I don't know what will happen to MAGI. But I don't think MAGI will be able to do anything about it. You are working on it in a special way, and I don't think there will be any problems with it. Well, Alex, there was nothing special about it. I don't know what will happen to MAGI.
SPEAKER_03: My name is Jairus Twiss. I don't have much to say, but I'd like to say that I like the accent and the biceps. I'm glad to be here.
SPEAKER_03: . . . . .
SPEAKER_03: Can you turn your microphone off when you are not talking? Yeah, thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Well, first of all, I have to say I didn't see any special preparation from Alex. I was expecting more from his performance. As for myself, I'm specifically preparing the shoulder strength, the bicep strength, the side pressure. I don't count or it would be risky to go the usual top roll way because Jerry is definitely a very special opponent.
SPEAKER_00: And I have to prepare specifically. And even yesterday, me and the boys, we pulled and focused specifically on the shoulder and bicep strength. And looking at the weights that I'm lifting, I'm happy with that. I have gained quite a lot and I'm lifting the weights that I was planning to. Jerry, did you, my friend, did you see...
SPEAKER_01: Or what do you think that Alex tried to do against you? Because that was not his classic positioning when he pulled against you. I saw him closer.
SPEAKER_04: And what do you think that he tried to do? And why do you think that he failed? I think he tried a couple different things. And his first match, he tried to go to the back of the pad and trying to open me up.
SPEAKER_04: and uh second match he tried to come in with me which didn't work out well and i think the third match he was just so confused he didn't know what to do and then he just tried to go and i just ended it quick yeah do you do you think that when when people try like when people have been pulling forever you know
SPEAKER_01: And then when they suddenly try to change their style because of you, do you think that the possibility of this being successful is high or low? I think when it's someone's first time going against me, it definitely weighs out in my favor because I don't think anyone out there would be comparative to me.
SPEAKER_04: So, there's other people that may do a price, but. I think I've got a pretty masters, right? And I think it's just different and they're expecting 1 thing and. They go in and they're, it's totally different from what they're expecting. Okay. Okay. And another question, you know, when we made the gauntlet.
SPEAKER_01: We have to make the gauntlet for Levan's hand because he was the current champion and he has the biggest hand. Do you think that it will be a problem for you when you win the gauntlet? No, it'll be fine. I'll force my hand in there. It's okay. Levan, do you think he will have the gauntlet? No. No, right? I mean, I'll let him try it on.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, so you will let him try? Yeah. You can take a couple pictures. I'll let him take a couple pictures with it on. That's a fact. What's that? And what do people do? Shop all the time. We cannot hear you.
SPEAKER_00: We could exchange the styles. He could go with the top roll and I can go with the price. Okay. As long as one match can go on the hook.
SPEAKER_00: But did you translate to him? David Devon understand that he said that after Jerry wins the gauntlet, he will let him try? Yeah, yeah. I told him . That gauntlet belongs to me. It's my size. OK.
SPEAKER_01: Jerry, what's your weight right now? Three and a quarter. Oh, 325. Okay. How many kilos is this? It's about 147, 148, 147, yeah. He's quite big. When you had a match with Genadi, what was your weight?
SPEAKER_04: uh what was I was thinking what I weighed 330. I mean I think you have been around the same you know like between 310 to 330 yards engine yeah I think I was on a 330 when I went against Genadi so about five pounds you will be the same until they went
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I've been doing more cardio and so it's tougher for me to gain the weight and I'm trying to walk too much and it keeps coming off. So whatever. But listen, unnecessary water is not really needed. Levan is also trying to lose five kilos just to make sure that he will not get pumped. Also, Jerry, you be careful. Devon't hurt your shoulder or something. We are only 19 days away.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, no heavy. This is my last week of heavy lifting. Then the following week, I'll just do medium lifting, and then it's the week of the meat, no lifting. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_04: And you remember we did a podcast with you. You said that your shape will be much better than Alex's. Do you think you are? I'm physically fit. I'm physically fit much better. So my body fat is less and my strength is there or better. How much better? 5%? Yeah, maybe a little bit more.
SPEAKER_04: I've been I set goals and I'm at or above where I expected to be.
SPEAKER_04: um and uh i'll be able to know today because every monday we do uh certain lifts and i keep adding weight each time and um so i'm going for a personal record today so we'll see you'll be careful you'll be careful tell him to not believe so heavy you don't want to hear that he is injured it won't it won't get injured don't worry what's that you know he's just
SPEAKER_01: That's right. It's not going to be about getting injured. It'll just be either I can do it or I can't do it. I can't get hurt trying it. Okay. Okay. That's good. That's good. Because we don't want, we don't need, this is a great match. This is a super heavyweight world title match. Like most important match in the world. And Levan pulls not so much twice a year. And this is very important time for harnessing. Levan pulls.
SPEAKER_01: You are pulling first time in North America, right? Jerry, can you turn the microphone off when I talk with him because it's really confusing. Thank you, my friend. Yeah, Levan, this is the first time you're pulling in North America, correct? Yes, yes. Yes, yeah. And when are you going there? Are you going like Sunday or Monday? When are you going?
SPEAKER_01: I came to America on December 9th. Oh, five days before the event. Okay, so Monday, Monday. Okay. And did you already start to adjust your sleeping times for America? No.
SPEAKER_03: No need? Yeah, adapting to the time zone can be an issue. But considering that the event is in the evening, I don't think that- I'm not sure if the event is in the evening.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so. I mean, because when we did the East versus West in Orlando, we started 1pm afternoon, like one hour afternoon. And because when it is one o'clock over there, it is where I am right now is 9pm in the evening.
SPEAKER_01: So if you start evening time, all Europe will be sleeping time. Maybe you ask that to Devon. I'm not sure about that. Devon would know better. Stop giving advice.
SPEAKER_01: okay what's the advice so I said stop giving advice let him oh yes Jerry Jerry is right Jerry is saying that Jerry is saying that listen I give you advice too to not to get injured or something I just want this match to happen you know yeah but Jerry is probably saying that we came to Istanbul 10 times
SPEAKER_03: And one time Levan is coming, let them also learn by experiencing. No need to share information. Right, Jerry? Yeah, you certainly weren't there, St. Jerry. Let's make sure we work on your sleep schedule before I get you all the way to Turkey.
SPEAKER_00: I do have an experience in changing time zones during the top eight. We had a match in Malaysia, in China. Yeah, yeah. So I'm not new to this. I do have some experience here. Yeah, yeah. This is now the opposite time zone.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no. I've been to America a lot, and I'm very happy. I don't want to go to America, and I don't think there will be any problem. There are Georgian melodies, there are songs.
SPEAKER_00: I was in the US one year ago. I felt good. The time period there was good to me. And also we have to consider that there will be a lot of Georgians that will be there. So I will be well fed, well taken after. So I expect to feel really good there. Yeah, like Levan, how many Georgians do you expect to come there? 150?
SPEAKER_03: The ones I know in my friend zone, they're roughly 60. So I'm sure there are plenty more who I don't know personally.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, especially in New York and Brooklyn, there's a high population of Georgians. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How far is it? How far is New York to Atlantic City? Probably what? Half an hour? Yeah, less than an hour. Oh, less than an hour. Okay. Okay. So Jerry,
SPEAKER_01: It will not be only USA, USA. There will be, we will also be here in some Georgia, Georgia. Yeah, I just can't wait. I love that. I love that. I think that the nations, they should never
SPEAKER_01: fight, but they should just fight this way or in other sport disciplines. It's beautiful. It's beautiful that we are all on the world, different nations and competing against each other. And then after the match, we still hug each other and whoever wins, wins, you know, the other one goes and trains more, comes back. That's how the life goes, you know? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, let's see. Let's see how it will be. Let's see. And you, Jerry, Levan has been making some adjustments for you. And do you need any adjustments for Levan? Or you are always used to pulling? No.
SPEAKER_04: I pulled a lot of people in their lives and historically, you know, the majority of them have always been top rollers.
SPEAKER_04: but uh so this for this event obviously I had to be prepared knowing that uh Devon is uh the cream of the crop right and he's he's at the top so uh giving that as much respect as I could possibly give I knew that I had to up my level and up my uh the the weight that I was going after so I did uh incorporate some other uh training methods into my regime
SPEAKER_01: uh to make sure that i can have something else in there to try to assist me in getting into my position back it looks like it could be a couple months from now we're just um do you think that do you think that the atmosphere did you did you watch the uh east versus west 14 orlando event orlando's events
SPEAKER_03: Yes, of course, and I would like to say something about my feelings. Because Chander was injured and the sportsmen were in danger. The media situation is not good. Of course, it is not good, because he was in the Atlantic City for a long time.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I did watch the event and I enjoyed it, but I had some concerns. I could see that the athletes were quite hot, the venue was quite packed.
SPEAKER_00: and it was a bit uncomfortable for the athletes uh now i expect this to be better uh it's already uh cold winter uh in atlanta and uh i expect this not to be an issue anymore yeah
SPEAKER_03: A lot of people have come and I think that a lot of people have come to understand what kind of people they are. And now there is no such thing with sportsmen as there was in the past, because when you go to the gym and
SPEAKER_00: And I think we will need larger venues going forward. And considering that the spectators are coming to the event and the crowd is only growing, definitely scale up and go to the larger venues.
SPEAKER_00: In Orlando, I could see that the distance between athletes and the spectators was quite small. And when you're surrounded by people, it can become tough for the athlete. So I think larger distance would be better. Yes, yes. We are now... At that time, we didn't know what to expect. And then when the tickets were sold out, like eight days before the event,
SPEAKER_01: We even changed the walkout direction. We made it from the side. Normally, it was going to come from the front side, so the walkout place from the front side, we gave more for the spectators because we didn't want people to stay out. It was summertime in Florida. It was very, very hot, but I think that from now on, it will only grow, and then we will for sure
SPEAKER_01: big bigger rooms and this event is very very important because world super heavyweight champion is coming to us and and i think like a lot of people will uh like to come and watch this event and jerry is an american and people will come and support
SPEAKER_01: their American fellow against Levan. And I think it will be incredible because last time, even last time it was incredible because of the American or North American pullers against the pullers from other side of the world. And now the biggest match, super heavyweight world title match is happening in North America. I mean, anyone near Arias, I'm sure that the hardcore fans will fly from everywhere.
SPEAKER_01: But other than that, I think the Northeast area is the most populated for arm wrestlers and arm wrestling fans. And I think that there will be an incredible atmosphere there. I just can't wait. I just can't wait how the match will happen.
SPEAKER_01: jerry compared to compared to before like after uh alex match and now like are you ready my friend are you ready are you ready to beat this guy and then upset like to cause the biggest upset in the history continue to do that whoa whoa are you calling it upset
SPEAKER_01: I mean, because when you look at all the polls of social media, including by me, he is considered the best, strongest arm master in the history. So if you do this, you realize that you will be the first one to do it in the professional arm wrestling. He didn't lose any super match. So that is obviously,
SPEAKER_02: It's normal that you look underdog on the paper. So how do you feel? Let me use this one. If you beat him, if you beat him,
SPEAKER_01: Whenever I say if you beat him, any of the opening for Jerry, he says, don't tell me if, say when. Yes, when. There has been some changes to . Okay, Jerry, tell us what you will do for this big guy. Come on. Listen, I'm anxious, right? We got less than three weeks to go.
SPEAKER_04: know you get nervous anxious all in one and uh you want to make sure that you know did i do enough you start to second guess yourself so i just want to i just want to get there and get going because um you know the truth will be when they say go right when they say go if uh you know if my training was the way i did it it was enough then i want i want us to be in that war right and uh
SPEAKER_01: Once there's a war, right, then I'm in it. Okay. If this is a war, do you see yourself losing? No. No, right? No. And if Levan tries to do what Ermes tries to do, this time things will be different because you are healthier now? Yes. Yep. No ailments. I'm good, right? My left arm's a little sore, but that's just to hold a peg, right? And to drive a car.
SPEAKER_01: But my right feels really good. So if Levan tries to do what Ermes tries to do, some surprise is waiting for him? Absolutely. Absolutely. Levan has no emotions. He's just looking at you. He's a good dude. He earned his seat, but
SPEAKER_04: You know, it's the seats was rented rent to do. I got it. So, time, time to change the driver. So, yes, yeah, yeah, let him let him have someone else to chase. He'll put my, my picture up and he can chase me. Okay, service team understands that there's been Austin here and deals that anyone. Thank you, Jerry. And the 1.
SPEAKER_01: What is this guy's chance of beating you? I know you are never like a guy that I will crush you, I will beat you type of guy. But can you tell us like, honestly, like, how much chance Jerry has for you? I mean, against you? Well, I don't have any motivation to beat him. I don't know what to say. And I think it's a good thing that he didn't lose a round.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think I'll be able to win the match if I don't do my best. I don't think I'll be able to win the match if I don't do my best. I don't think I'll be able to win the match if I don't do my best. I don't think I'll be able to win the match if I don't do my best. I think I'll be able to win the match if I don't do my best.
SPEAKER_03: And in terms of chances, Jerry is a great sportsman and I don't want to say that he doesn't have any chance, but he has some percentage. I know that everything is going to be very serious. I know that the next match will not be psychological for me.
SPEAKER_03: I'm coming to the US to win 6-0. I'm not even considering any scenario where I lose the match.
SPEAKER_00: There's nothing even to discuss. We might discuss him taking one round. We can have a talk around that.
SPEAKER_00: That could be in some imaginary scenario, but I'm coming for 6-0. And even though I respect Jerry a lot, he's a great athlete. I'm not going to say any number percentages here because he's a great athlete. And I even consider the scenario that it might not be a flash pin right from the get-go. I'm prepared for long fights as well. I will do everything and I'm looking forward to the 14th of December.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, he doesn't have to he didn't need to say any percentage because he's going to do 60 and there is no other scenario, you know. And so, so Jerry, basically, he's giving you a 0%, you know. So, let me steal the pot a little bit, you know, Jerry, do you have a 0%. And what I mean by that is, I wouldn't show up if I thought it was a 0%. Right. It would be wasting people's time energy and, uh.
SPEAKER_04: uh attention right so i'm going there to make sure that it's a war right and uh with it being a war my percentage becomes higher the longer we're in the match the higher my percentage of weakness the goal is to make it wrong make it painful and uh you know come out victorious
SPEAKER_04: I think there's no question that LeVon is ridiculously strong. I think there's no question that he's skilled. So the question is going to be...
SPEAKER_04: not what's going to happen when his style meets my style right and uh how how well she goes through counteracts and uh i think you know like i said i've gone against super strong top rollers and i've gone against you know plenty of people that you know pull his way uh he has not gone against anyone that pulls his brain so i'm i'm considered the darkest right the unknown
SPEAKER_04: And until he gets up there and goes and he can say he's prepared, he can say he's everything. And I expect him to come in. He earned the spot that he's in. No one's even beat him one match.
SPEAKER_04: He's unquestionably earned the number one role. For me, it's what everyone wants. Everyone wants that title that he's holding. But it's not going to be easily taken. It won't be handed away. You've got to fight for it. So you've got to go in ready for a battle. Do you think that pulling in your homeland and no different time zone, you are just a little bit north, you live?
SPEAKER_04: And do you think that you will be feeling better compared to other times that you travel all the way to Istanbul? Oh, yeah. I think that I noticed that when I went against Alex, you know, it's being surrounded by, you know, people from your country and, you know, you don't want to let them down and they're cheering you on. You thrive off that. And I think that's a huge motivation, a huge plus.
SPEAKER_04: to to have that behind you and uh you know the the same time zone i think that's awesome too and then this is only what less than 300 miles from my house so um i think that uh you know that's that's a huge plus too are you gonna drive or fly something no i am uh it's weird right uh my wife is flying
SPEAKER_04: And I have to go for a work event up in upstate New York in Albany. So I'm going to take an Amtrak down from Albany to get to outside of Atlantic City. And then I'll probably just rent a car or something to get from there over, right? A little bit of a pain in the ass because the Albany is a small airport. And the last flight, I'd still be at work. The last flight's like at 4 or 4.30.
SPEAKER_01: I have a question for you. This guy that you see in front of you that you will face on December 14th, whatever has been proved from the beginning of the arm wrestling history in the modern time till today, is this guy the proven one? I'm not saying that
SPEAKER_04: you will lose against him. But after this match, is this guy the best super heavyweight ever in the history? Yeah, I think so. I've been around for 35 years and I've seen everyone and I've gone against everyone. I think his resume speaks highly. The only difference is where he...
SPEAKER_04: seldom compete right um whereas you know back back in the day you're you're measuring against people that they uh they we didn't have super match styles back in the day you know what i mean it was you went to a tournament and you had to win the entire tournament to get to be declared the winner so um i think unquestionably him one-on-one
SPEAKER_01: It's the best ever. And you are ready to just, that's why I said it, you are ready to mark your signature on December 14th, the one that will be the best supply weight in history. Those deals were uncapped. Got it.
SPEAKER_01: that's okay i don't i don't think he said that but i think he uh
SPEAKER_01: I think he says he's coming to win. He's going to be 6-0. When you have the 6-0 on the paper, it's like they're throwing you. What's that?
SPEAKER_01: Engin is pulling on the nerves. I'm going to be a little bit nicer, Engin, right? I think it'll be more like I win 4-2. 4-2? 4-2? Okay, okay. And then people will remember, right? December 14, 2024.
SPEAKER_01: Do you remember when Jerry beat Levan? Right. It will be like, remember that way, Jerry? Yes. That's it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Anyway, so another question for you guys. Thank you, Jerry. Let me ask you Levan. Okay. Levan, you saw the match between Michael Todd and Genadi Kvikvinia.
SPEAKER_01: And the winner of this match was going to pull, is already set to pull against Ermes Gasparini. And then winner of them, Michael and Ermes, will be pulling the winner of you and Jerry in spring for the gauntlet. And you are sure of yourself that you're going to be Jerry stick zero. And so,
SPEAKER_01: I will ask him from this way. Since you believe you're going to win, who do you think is going to come against you in spring? Michael or Ermes will be coming to you? Huge respect to Michael and his winning streak, but I think it will be Ermes. Hmm.
SPEAKER_03: So, the progress of Michael that lately we see will not be enough, huh, Levan? No, it's not enough, Michael. It's not enough, because the reception of the FES has been very good, I think.
SPEAKER_03: From the beginning, Merechkeli was playing in Bologna, and Ermes was playing in Tricep. If Ermes hadn't been so good in the past, he would have been very good in the past, and if he had been better than Ermes, then Ermes would have been a different person.
SPEAKER_00: With all due respect, I think Ermes can handle the match. He has a good press, good flop press too. I think he will try to top roll him, will get stuck.
SPEAKER_00: but will transition successfully and will manage to press him down. Even if we look at their earlier match, where Ermes was a little kid, he was already a really tough opponent for Michael, and now Ermes is a whole different human. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Michael said that he was in Italy for a vacation or something and I don't think he was also in super shape but yes my Ermes was much lighter and yeah it was a very tough match I think Ermes lost on cows or something
SPEAKER_00: But still, everything is possible. Michael can surprise us. He has done this many times before. I think he does have a chance. But from at the current standpoint, I think the chances favor Ermes. And Jerry, in May, who is coming to pull against you?
SPEAKER_04: Ermes or Michael? Well, remember, I never root against anyone from the North America. Oh, so you want to pull Ermes? Oh, you mean against, against, against. Okay, so you're going to pull Michael, you are saying? I'll root for Michael, right? Because I always root for everyone from the North America. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I would really enjoy a rematch with Ermes. Hmm. So...
SPEAKER_01: What should we understand from this? Who do you want to win? Oh, no, no. I'm going to root for Mike because he's from the USA. But you are saying that if somehow Ermes wins, you will be happy for that as well, just to get your chance to revenge. Yes. I kind of wonder, you know, how no one feels when I ask the question that way, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Levan, how do you feel that whenever I ask who he's going to pull in summer, sorry, spring, Michael or Ermes, do you think inside of you, like, why is he even answering this question, he will not be the one who is pulling? Just track him, Mike. Levan, if I may, I have a question for you. You said you were going to pull Michael or Ermes.
SPEAKER_03: Do you want to talk about Jerry's story? No, you can talk about Jerry's story.
SPEAKER_03: . . . . . .
SPEAKER_03: Yes, that's right. Can you turn the microphone on? I'd like to say a few words to all of you. I'd like to say a few words to all of you.
SPEAKER_00: Of course, you should ask him this question. And to be honest, I don't want to be an unquestioned favorite in any match. I expect a tough opponent, I expect a tough fight, and I expect to win. But still, I don't want anybody to think that my opponent has zero chance.
SPEAKER_03: It's better for armwrestling and for the fans to really know that this match will be tough. I would prefer not to be there. I would prefer not to be there. I would prefer not to be there.
SPEAKER_03: For me, psychology is very comfortable. I mean, it's very comfortable when everyone thinks that I'm a fool, that I'm an outsider, that I have a psychological problem.
SPEAKER_00: And yeah, that's better for my mental state as well. Psychologically, I would prefer for some of the fans to think that Jerry will win. This will make myself more prepared, more motivated.
SPEAKER_00: And this means that it will be a great fight for the arm wrestling fans as well. So I think that's better for me too. And it's better for Jerry as well, because from the underdog perspective, he has nothing to lose. And that, of course, gives him points as well.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
SPEAKER_03: I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't want to say that
SPEAKER_03: I'm not a fan of this sport. I'm not a fan of this sport. I'm not a fan of this sport. I'm a fan of this sport.
SPEAKER_00: And to be honest, I don't want to repeat the same mistake that I did with Ermes. I learned my lesson. I was a bit too relaxed going into the match because everybody was saying, and Ermes too, that probably there's no chance. I would be happy even just to give a fight.
SPEAKER_00: uh and actually this kills the spirit of competition i didn't come to the sport of arm wrestling for money or for becoming a millionaire i love this sport because of the fight because of the competition
SPEAKER_00: and that's the what gives me uh pleasure and that's what I love so uh here here uh I have learned my lesson and uh I uh really like that Jerry comes to win and he's motivated and he's coming for the fight uh that gives me a correct mental state as well yeah um Levan do you think
SPEAKER_01: If you win against Jerry, and if Ermes wins against Michael, do you think that Ermes will come with the same stance? Like, you know, if I win one round, it's good, or this time he's coming to beat you? No, I don't think so. I think Ermes will win the next round.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think if this match happens, Ermes will be coming for victory. But I promise if that's the case, I will destroy him. Okay, so that's what we want to hear. We want to hear. That's what we want to hear because he will also come to beat you. Yeah, if he can come and if you are still there, you know. And yeah, that is... And...
SPEAKER_01: Is it like me or you have some problem? You won the match Levan last time, but the community was celebrating almost like Ermes won and you lost or something, you know? So I kind of feel that it is a little personal for you. Not personal against the Ermes, but like something that you need to prove
SPEAKER_00: that it was only a one-time thing, it will never happen, it will never repeat again. Do you have something like this to prove? Or yourself? I would like to ask you, Mr. Chakchao, about the reaction of all the participants. It's not your fault, it's not my fault. What happened? I would like to ask you, Mr. Chakchao, if it happened.
SPEAKER_03: Magma has something to do with motivation. Magma has a lot to do with motivation.
SPEAKER_03: There are a lot of things that I can say about him. In general, I would say that he is a very talented person. He has done a lot of great things. I would say that he is very talented.
SPEAKER_03: That match has taught me a lot. I took really good lessons from it.
SPEAKER_00: and it motivates me really good. I think it also showed the real face of some of my fans and I saw that some people were really happy that they saw a crack in my game and that really motivates me to become better. I think that
SPEAKER_00: This match, I didn't win it in the style that I wanted. And if it happens again, I will make sure that I will be proud of that rematch and I will do as I usually do.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. If such rematch happens, it has a different meaning for both Levan and Ermes. But Jerry, what are we talking about? Ermes and Levan can only pull as the guys who lost their next matches, right? And then you will be pulling Michael. I was just going to say that must mean you get expecting a Jerry and Michael match. Okay. So Jerry, Michael for the gauntlet and then Levan, Ermes for the third place? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: okay okay okay and yeah anyway so peter anchor is asking hello ending can you ask levan his best top roll exercise and jerry's best press exercise let me ask these questions and then you guys uh let us finish it is almost one hour what is your best top roll exercise 11.
SPEAKER_03: What role do you think you played in the war? I think I played a role in the war. I think I played a role in the war.
SPEAKER_00: yeah for the top roll I have shown this in many uh my previous videos the favorite for me is when I put the leg on the bench uh I put the elbow uh against the knee and I pull up and Jerry your favorite press training
SPEAKER_04: Sorry, I had the mute button pushed. Your best pressure training? Yeah, I'd say it's a combination of a couple. I like to do the diamond push-ups where my fingers are together and where I do push-ups and go down and touch my nose in between them. So it goes down this way because it's almost the same motion. And then I've got an actual machine
SPEAKER_04: that i use and it's it's good for the press along with uh i got the six inch handle that i turn and then try to it it wants to flip back but i use it to press on the on the table so it's a cable driven and i use it to go on the table okay and then there is okay there's a question for levon
SPEAKER_01: is asking who do you think is that you know real number two in the world after you i think it's devon okay
SPEAKER_01: Okay, Conor Reyes asked Levan what he will do if Eddie Hall falls at the table. What he does? He falls. I don't know what kind of question is that, but I don't know what does it have to do with Levan. Levan is not pulling Eddie, but just... No, Eddie Hall is not pulling Eddie, but just...
SPEAKER_03: I hope nobody lights the lighter in the room. There was one more question.
SPEAKER_01: I really want to see Brian Shaw. I know he's huge and I want to feel how it is to be a little boy. Around him, right? Around him, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it will be big fun over there. I hope that people go there and really witness this historical event. Yeah. Anyway, so one last question. Who has the biggest chance against you, Levan, in your opinion?
SPEAKER_01: Do you think that because of his style, Jerry may be problematic, most problematic, or you think someone else may have more chance against you? How I see at the moment, I think the most dangerous opponent for me is Jerry. Because he is unknown, right? Unknown. It's something that Levan didn't experience before. The rest...
SPEAKER_01: He knows, you know, because he pulled them. He pulled against Ermes. He pulled against Genadi. He pulled against Devon. He pulled against Laletin. He didn't pull against Michael yet and Jerry.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I think that's all. And also one last thing. Vitalii, I asked Vitalii, do you plan to pull against Levan? And he said he lives for that day. And he really is coming for you. Do you have any message for him?
SPEAKER_03: What message do you want to convey to the people who are watching you? I want to convey to the people who are watching me and to those who are watching me. There is no problem for the people who are watching Vitalii, because he is in a great shape and he is a great man.
SPEAKER_03: It will be interesting to see Vitalii and Gasparini's rematch. It will also be interesting to see Vitalii's match against Jerry. And I don't know...
SPEAKER_03: He lives for that day, but he might get old waiting. I don't have any trouble meeting him anytime.
SPEAKER_00: Um, actually there are many great matches that I would like to see Vitalii in a rematch with Ermes or match with Jerry. Uh, those would be really interesting. Uh, I'm happy to have, uh, uh, I'm happy to teach him a lesson, uh, the second time as well. Uh, he can prepare and, um, he will get the second lesson and for years to come, he will have to wait again. So I'm only happy to do that. Hmm.
SPEAKER_01: And I said the last question, I will ask one more question. Is there any possibility for us to see Levan more often or is it good like this? Sorry, could you repeat? Is there any possibility for us to see Levan competing a bit more often?
SPEAKER_01: Not every six months, but just say every five months or something, every four months, five months, you know. Is it possible or is it okay like this? Is it possible or is it okay like this? Is it possible or is it okay like this? Is it possible or is it okay like this? Is it possible or is it okay like this? Is it possible or is it okay like this?
SPEAKER_03: I would like to thank you for the invitation and I would like to thank you for the invitation, Elodebote Sanu. I don't want to go into too much detail. I think that this is of great interest to me, as I have already mentioned it many times. However,
SPEAKER_03: I don't want to say that I'm going to lose weight because I have a lot of weight gain. And I don't want to say that I'm going to lose weight because I have a lot of weight gain. And I don't want to say that I'm going to lose weight because I have a lot of weight gain. And I don't want to say that I'm going to lose weight because I have a lot of weight gain. And I don't want to say that I'm going to lose weight because I have a lot of weight gain.
SPEAKER_00: I would gladly pull more often, but we have to consider what would be better overall. Because me competing relatively rarely, maybe twice a year as it is at the moment, it's also more interesting for the fans as well, I think. Competing more often might become a bit unimportant in the eyes of the spectators.
SPEAKER_00: and having matches more rarely happening, it gives more meaning and more preparation.
SPEAKER_00: more overall value to the game. Also, I have mentioned this before, is that I have to really prepare well. I have to bring my best game. I have the responsibility. And for that, I need the time to gain my best shape. Plus, I have other responsibilities as well. Other things I do in between. So I have to
SPEAKER_01: plan everything accordingly. Okay. Okay. I'm also an actor now. Yeah, yeah, you're an actor, yeah. Yeah, we are proud of you. We are proud of you, yeah. Yeah, and we are happy that, you know, one of us is in the movie. Yeah, that's good. We are proud of you. Great job, my friend. Great job.
SPEAKER_03: You are a great representative of... I would like to say that if it happens, I would like to say that if it happens, I would like to say that if it happens, I would like to say that if it happens, I would like to say that if it happens, I would like to say that if it happens, I would like to say that if it happens, I would like to say that
SPEAKER_03: But actually, next year, if there is a possibility, if there is an arrangement and there are opponents, we can do three times next year. Yeah, I mean, important, important. So what you are just saying, Levande, you are open. I understand.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, it depends on many factors. I'm not saying that two is my plan or something. It depends. If possible, I would gladly put more. Okay, okay. So basically he's saying that if there is worth the opponents and if he is not super busy with his acting career as an actor. And so he says that he's not saying no, it's possible.
SPEAKER_03: But we will see. This is what I understand. So he says it's possible.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's about the worthy opponent. It's about having a schedule because I have to basically give all my time to preparation. I have to time it. So it depends on the schedule as well. So there are multiple factors, but overall it's possible, definitely. I understand. Yeah. Anyways, Levan, my friend, thank you very, very much.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you very much, my friends. And we are proud of you. And I wish you safe travel to North America. And I hope that everything will be fine. You guys will pull. And as an organizer, I can only wish the best both of you and let the better one win. And thank you very much, Tornike. As always, you are a great addition.
SPEAKER_01: You are not only a translator. We really like you as a friend. And is there any last word you want to say, Devon? LEVON TALBOTOVICHEVICHEVICHEVICHEV.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you very much, Lasha, Aleko, Irakli, Tato, Sandro. Thank you very much. What can I say? I am very happy to be in the United States, and I am very happy to be able to speak to Georgians.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he thanks his friends, myself, Vako, Lasha, Irakli, Aleko, everybody who supports him in the training, in preparation. He's really excited about this match. He thinks it will be a great match. He expects a lot of fans to attend it. Hopefully a lot of Georgians can attend it.
SPEAKER_01: And he promises to his fans that he will win. Okay, okay. Anyways, you take care of yourself, Levan. And you too, Tony. Just show us, show us. Yeah, show us the bicycle. Yeah, yeah. It's big, yeah. Yeah, elbow and everything. Okay, okay. How is the left arm? Left arm finished, right? No, no, it looks great. But you don't want to pull, right? You will not pull?
SPEAKER_03: Well, it's a good thing, and it's a good thing, I mean, I've been in a lot of trouble lately, and it's a good thing that I came here, and it's not a big deal, it's not a big deal, and I don't think it's a problem for everyone, I think it's a good thing, and I don't think it's a problem for everyone, I don't think it's a problem for everyone,
SPEAKER_00: My left shoulder is not feeling the best at the moment. I managed to get my wrist and fingers better on the left. They became stronger. But now the shoulder became the limiting factor. I don't know what's the case. It used to be that left was invincible. I never had injuries on it. But now this shoulder... Baba, wrist is okay now, Levan?
SPEAKER_03: It's better than before, but I'm still not sure about the left-hand match.
SPEAKER_00: we had a sparring on the left yesterday uh it's good for one one round uh but after that the pain comes in uh i don't know if it's a joint or something else but after one round it's it's not as good anymore so
SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure about it. Probably this is because I'm focusing so much on the right and the strength on the right that maybe it's an imbalance or left needs more attention. So could be something like that.
SPEAKER_01: We will see. We will see how it will be. I hope to see you with left arm too, because your left arm career at WAF was better than your right arm career. I have only one loss on the left with Tvetkov in Bulgaria. One round, right? One round, 2015. Two rounds, right?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, I had to leave. I had to leave. It was a difficult and difficult moment.
SPEAKER_00: It was the Europe championship in 2015. Yeah, Bulgaria. Yes, I got to the final without loss. He had one loss for the final and he won twice. Several months later, we met again on the world championship.
SPEAKER_01: And I won at that time. Okay, yeah. I remember the Europeans that also you won one match, you lost one match to Arif and then you beat him later. Yeah, I remember, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It is very important to know that the weight of the body, which many athletes and sportsmen have, the weight of the body, according to the virus, is about 7 kilos. And the weight of the body, as I said, depends on the weight of the body.
SPEAKER_03: And now we are 10 kilometers away in 3 or 4 days. And we are very close to the city and the city is very close to the city. And we are very close to the city and the city is very close to the city. We are very close to the city.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he has advice to the newcomers to the sport. He made some mistakes during the preparation for that 2015 tournament. He got a fever several days before the competition and he lost seven kgs. So when he arrived to Bulgaria, he started to carb up and drink a lot of water.
SPEAKER_00: uh to get he got afraid because of this lost weight with juices with carbs with sweets he panically gained 10 kgs back and this was a big mistake yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: I'm like crazy and I don't advise anyone. Levan, how many more years you're going to compete, you think? Do you have any plan? 10 more years, do you plan? I definitely want to compete until 45.
SPEAKER_01: If health... How old are you now, Levan? 36, yeah. So nine more years he wants to compete, yeah, for sure.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, for sure, for nine more years, if the health permits, and he definitely wants to. And Engi knows that armwrestling is a sport that you can never quit. I can always, I might always come back, so you can never tell.
SPEAKER_01: Who may come back, Ike? No, he said about himself, but he said that Engin knows well that you can never quit arm wrestling. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm also start training. I want to compete, Levan. I don't want to watch you guys there. Watching like this is no good, no good. I mean, watching is good, but I also want there with the adrenaline and compete, you know? My dream is to see your match against Devon.
SPEAKER_01: With Devon? Yeah. You don't want to see that. You don't want to see that. Listen, what he did to Petrenko, you saw it. The guy is a super heavyweight guy. Devon is too much. Too much for 105, too much for 115. Only if he's super heavyweight up there, he can compete with him, you know? I mean, it's like there is no way, you know? No way. And
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but if you have realistic wishes, I can try to make it happen. But don't tell me like you want to see me down. Yeah, yeah. Anyways, yeah. Levan, thank you very much, my friend, once again. You take care of yourself and make sure that you stay healthy and
SPEAKER_01: We will be watching you guys. We will be watching you guys and everything will be great. Yeah. Thank you very much. Once again. Thank you. Take care of yourself. Yeah. Great. Bye. Bye.
Speaker: Hmm.
