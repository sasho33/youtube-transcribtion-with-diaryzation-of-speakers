SPEAKER_04: Hello, hello, everyone.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Hello, everyone. David Onignak Hamza Adnan Eyaludriv.
SPEAKER_03: Hello, nothing is impossible. Silky Milky, hello. GB19, Thomas Black, Wolfson, Dan Lopez, Hamza, and many others. How are you guys doing? Yeah, we are starting.
SPEAKER_03: a new podcast series for East versus West 16. I think it's a great event. How do you guys like the card? David you guys like it? Thank you, guys. Yes, Rai Monsi will be big.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you, Jakub. What's up? Hey, Michael. How are you? I'm well, sir. How are you? Good. A video for three weeks already. So how is everything getting bigger and bigger? What is that 318? Your weight? That's what I weighed. What was it? Not last night, the night before last.
SPEAKER_00: My morning weight is 310 maybe? I weighed 310 yesterday morning. Yeah, when I woke up. I don't know if I'll stay this big because the last two weeks I just kind of enjoyed myself and ate what I wanted. So my nutrition is going to be perfect for the next six weeks, but still a bunch of calories. Still a bunch of calories. Yeah, but this time is not strict, but you want to enjoy. That's what you said. You want to eat whatever you want to eat. Yeah, we didn't eat a lot. We just ate whatever we wanted, you know.
SPEAKER_00: but the strength has gone up like i'm already on everything except for my pronation lift i'm stronger now than i was final prep for uh ganadi i don't think you need you need like to increase your pronation we don't see if somebody's turning in that way anyways you know
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, no, it's just a confidence thing. The more I can, because right now the weights, I can do more than I'm doing. I'm just following my programming. So every other day I just add a pound. But it feels good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, what I meant to say that, like, even the way it was against Genadi, your pronator, like, I mean, seems strong enough, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean, Devon's like, you don't have to get any stronger with your pronation. Um, but it's just one of those things that the more you can do, the better you feel, the more confident you feel. The main focus is my riser. I want to make sure my riser holds up. Um, and I've been doing a lot of side pressure training, which I liked a lot. Hello. Hello, my friend. How are you? What's up, dude? Good. Good. Can you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. How many years has it been? Eight. Eight years. March will be eight years. Okay. So February 15 is closing up. So eight years later. Seven years, 11 months. Yeah. Yeah. I never expected really to fight again.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, who knows? Hutchings are crazy. You got really big, and I'm deciding to be big again, so it looks like we got to do it again, you know? Because many athletes, maybe they don't fight each other, and maybe one loses, another wins. It's very difficult to...
SPEAKER_02: You know, there are a lot of events, but it's very difficult to meet with all the athletes. Yeah, the same person again. Yeah. Ernest, don't tell me that you're going to hold the camera next one and a half hour.
SPEAKER_03: No problem. Too much. It's no problem for you, but I get like, you know, dizzy. You can get dizzy. Very stable, my friend. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. We will see your endurance. We will have some idea about your endurance. There you go. Are you holding me with right arm? Huh? Are you holding me with right arm? Right here? Right. Every time. Oh, okay. With the riser like this.
SPEAKER_03: I hope it's going to rest enough in the next six weeks. If you hold one and a half hour like that, yeah. We will try to make it shorter, yeah. That's interesting. You said seven years or eight years, you said? It'll be eight, March. March will be eight. So it's like seven years, ten and a half months, something like that. Yeah, eight years ago, Michael...
SPEAKER_03: probably around prime, I should say, Michael?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I was really good in that time frame. I just wasn't the best that day. Yeah, I understand. I had some good wins. That year, I won the Arnold Classic three weeks before I pulled Ermes. And then, what was it? Three months later, I won the WAL against Travis and Dave Chafee and those guys. And then that year, I lost to Pushkar 4-2.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah but when i said the prime i'm not talking about the specific event but like you know yeah because you you almost beat pushkar you know yeah i mean if he would have been so smart round five i had a good shot you know yeah yeah yeah yeah so what i'm just saying eight years ago prime michael versus a new guy
SPEAKER_03: You know, nobody really expected him to give you trouble at that time. And now, eight years later, now he's ranked above you. And at that time, he was underdog. For today, I cannot say anybody is underdog, but he is ranked above, so the life is interesting. I would say he's a favorite. I would say Ermes is a favorite. Right now? Yeah, I mean... Yeah, that's not what you believe.
SPEAKER_00: No, I don't believe that. I'm just saying the rest of the world would say that he's the favorite. I mean, think about it. I've had one year back. I've been competing for one year, and I've had the matches I've had. I've had a good run, but look what everything he's done. Like, he's lost two matches, three matches. Since, what was it, December 2021, he's lost three matches. He lost to Alex. He lost to Devon. He lost to LeBron. I mean...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, that's a very impressive record. I mean, the people he's beat, Vitalii, Dave, what's his face? Jerry. I can't believe I forgot Jerry. I mean, he's been a lot of really big guys, so he should be the favorite.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but we hear more about what you think. We see what others write and think, but I don't see it that way. I see very balanced opinions on the social media. Maybe a little bit on his favour, maybe 60-40 on his favour.
SPEAKER_03: A lot of people believe that you're going to win, and a lot of people believe that Ermes is going to win. And so I was just saying that, like, it was just eight years ago, he was, like, we can say newcomer, and now he's...
SPEAKER_03: grown totally in his prime and I just can't wait. This match is very, very important. This match being a rematch is like secondary important. The most important thing is that this match is being, how do you say, kind of qualification for Levan, you know.
SPEAKER_00: This is a huge match. I tell people all the time, I don't mean to cut you off, is my goal is obviously to pull Levan. But the most important match of my life is this match with Ermes. Because if I don't win this, I don't get a shot at Levan. You can pull next year with Levan. That's what I say. Listen, you're 20 years younger than me. You have plenty of time to pull Levan. Maybe something too fast is not good, my friend. Next year you can pull Levan.
SPEAKER_00: I have a short window. I have a short window that I have to accomplish this. I don't want to be this big forever. You know what I mean? I just want to be this big to accomplish the goal. And then after that, I want to be healthy, you know? So probably after this, you want to be 115? No, I mean, I think once I get, so no disrespect to Ermes, but once I get to pull LeVon and the weight that I get to for that weight, I think I'll probably come down to about 125, 130 and be really fit.
SPEAKER_00: okay and you will be competing in super still yeah okay okay yeah i mean for me to get to 115 like it's a lot of nutrition like i have to i have to really really really restrict my calories my body naturally wants to be bigger because i don't have the best metabolism you know genetically i'm it's easier for me to gain weight genetically so you guys are trying to convince each other you know
SPEAKER_03: let me win, so I pull Levan, you pull next year or something. What am I seeing here as an organizer? You guys are going to... I think both of us want to win this match very badly, and I think both of us are going to try to be the very best that we can be February 15th, you know? Yeah, I agree. I agree. And... Michael, like, you pull Pushkar.
SPEAKER_03: and you gave him big trouble and you almost like won that one if he didn't figure out something different and do you think how do you see your shape
SPEAKER_00: compared to that shape because push car was the best and you were like like there right there you know right so my opinion is just and it's not an opinion it's just facts the facts are i have been stronger in traditional gym lifts like if you're talking about bench press squat deadlift super heavy curls i've done heavier numbers on all those lifts than i do today but in arm wrestling specific exercises this is the strongest arm wrestling specific exercises i've ever been
SPEAKER_03: Do you believe that your chance would be higher today? Or if you would just travel in time and go back to Poland in 2017? In my opinion, if I could go back in time and be the version that I am now and face Pushkar in 2017, I would have won that match. I understand. So you are telling Ermes to be careful. Ermes, talk, talk. I will see if your voice is shaking or not.
SPEAKER_00: No, it's not. Burmese is prepared. He's ready for this match. I mean, he, he understands that, you know, anything could happen in arm wrestling. Anything could happen. So, um,
SPEAKER_03: it's just best man on that day whoever's the best most prepared person on that day is going to be the guy that wins last time like someone approached that way it was devon and he was saying oh you are way strong your favorite you know and then oh no michael should do stronger now
SPEAKER_02: I will try, but I don't know why I will go. I will try to do something, we will see. I will do my best. You will do your best. Listen, I kind of feel that neither of you is just telling fans right now exactly how you feel, but it's okay. What can we do? Oh, really, for me,
SPEAKER_02: I've never been healthy like now. With doing a lot of cardio, my endurance is two times more. I show a lot of difference with this training. I'm doing a lot of isometric, a lot of table training. For this match, it will be the key to win.
SPEAKER_02: It will be a long match for sure. A lot of technical matches and the endurance will be the key to win this fight. Who's endurance is better? I think I'm a lot of favourites about this because now he is too big.
SPEAKER_02: I fed when I was 132, 133 kilos. Maybe you have more power in the beginning, but in the long period, long match, you will go down more faster than when you are lighter. You know what I mean?
SPEAKER_02: Is the fact that it's difficult to be 140, 150 kilos and to have endurance like 125, 120? Do you agree with that? Of me? Do you think that you should be heavy, really heavy? Is it going to be your heaviest ever?
SPEAKER_00: okay so it'll be my hip okay and I can't say I know what I weighed two days ago so the heaviest I've ever woke up in the morning in my life was February 8 2018 and I weighed 323.6 pounds wow but I was a fatty I was fat um I went to bed Wednesday night at 318 pounds but that had probably I probably had
SPEAKER_00: five pounds of clothes on, right? So I woke up yesterday at 310 pounds, 310.4. I don't think I'll stay this size because like I was telling you before Army's got on the call, the last two weeks of the year I trained, but I also enjoyed the holidays. I just ate like a normal person. Whatever someone was serving is what I ate. I didn't really monitor my food that much. I made sure I had enough protein, but I didn't really care about what else I was eating.
SPEAKER_00: So yesterday we started 100% nutrition. So I will have perfect nutrition for six weeks because it matches six weeks from today. I started my cardio yesterday. I have not done much cardio in the last six months at all. You know, just haven't. Which means even when I was pulling Camille, I didn't do much cardio. When I pulled Genadi, I wasn't doing much cardio. David you feel like you needed it?
SPEAKER_00: So my endurance in an arm wrestling match comes from a belief that when the match stops, I usually want to win more than my opponent, or I usually hate losing more than my opponent likes to win. So for me, so much of this match stoppage and how long a match goes, a lot of it for me is just mental and belief. You can prepare your body through cardio and everything else to have better endurance,
SPEAKER_00: And that's amazing. I think on February 15th, we're both going to want to win really, really bad. And in my opinion, I think Armys has to, I think he has to beat me relatively quickly.
SPEAKER_00: or get me in a really bad position very fast and then work from there. If he can't do one of those two things, I believe I'm going to win, even if it is a long match. I also think whoever wins the hand battle, the height and the hand battle, is most likely, I mean, he could potentially still win those things and it could go multiple rounds and I could find a way to win maybe.
SPEAKER_00: If he loses the height and hand battle, I feel like the match is mine. Like, I feel like I have a better opportunity to win from a bad position than Ermes does. Even though he did a great job against LeVon from bad positions, I think I've lived in bad positions for so long I'm still comfortable. I don't want to be in those positions, but I realize that Ermes is a very, very formidable opponent. And, I mean, who knows? I mean, I don't even know where Devon's ranked right now. I know Devon's ranked number two.
SPEAKER_00: But we don't really know. I think Devon deservingly ranks number two. Whatever is proven is proven. Unless someone proves something different. I was just going to say, there's a chance that Ermes is at a very, very, very high level right now. So I'm excited about getting the opportunity to pull him because I think I'm at a high level as well. And you're the one that told me, beat Camille, get to pull Genadi. Beat Genadi, get to pull Ermes. I keep my promises.
SPEAKER_00: You said I beat Armin as I get to pull LeVon. And you know from long, calm conversations with me that my goal is to pull LeVon. So you're giving me the opportunity. I just unfortunately have a gladiator in between me and LeVon. So I feel like we're going to have to
SPEAKER_00: get in the cage and fight. Do you feel like you are in a street fighter game? You know, next character and the next character, you know? It's kind of how it's been going, but that's what I asked for. I asked for that. And I mean, you guys, I think all of us have faith here. I think we're all believers in something, right? I just believe that right now, this is my time. I just, you can't convince me otherwise. I believe that things have lined up in a way to where
SPEAKER_03: I have an opportunity to show the world all things are possible, and that's my plan. Michael, did you think that Genadi's match was close? I think it looked closer than what it actually was. Do you think that if you didn't finish him in the last round, it stopped you? In a long battle, you would still win?
SPEAKER_00: Because Genadi thinks the opposite way. He said if he would stop you, he would win. But while you believe that it wouldn't matter, this is what you're saying. So what I believed wholeheartedly, I didn't know this at the time. I believe if I would have had enough confidence in the strap, instead of just hitting backwards for control, I think I could have hit sideways and pending.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that after round one you did those finishes because he also got exhausted while trying to finish you? Or you think that it wouldn't matter if he would just go straight side, you could still beat him?
SPEAKER_00: I think on that day, I think I could have just went straight sideways and still won, in my opinion. I mean, we will never know. I'm sure I don't plan on quitting anytime soon. So I'm sure I'll get to face Genadi again one day. Yeah, yeah. You guys are 1-1 now. Yeah. You cannot leave it like this. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I like Genadi a lot. And what I do like is what Genadi was talking about.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry to be doing all the talking, but Genadi did an interview recently talking about Devon. And he said that Devon had said he thought I had the best chance against LeVon. And in the interview, he actually said he thinks that might be true because his triceps were very strong when he pulled me. He just feels like he pulled the best me.
SPEAKER_00: And then he went on to say he thinks he'll push Devon straight to the pad with his tricep press, right? And that was the first real compliment that I've gotten from Genadi about that match. No, no, no. Genadi said a lot more things about you. Okay. Yeah, I like Genadi a lot. Genadi said that
SPEAKER_03: He lost against you because you were better than him. And I said, so you finally accepted that? He said, sometimes, like during the moment of like losing psychology, we say some things.
SPEAKER_00: but i got over michael was better and he won this is what he told me oh that's very nice and then so listen and that's the thing is i don't honestly i used to care a lot about what people on social media said um but this whole journey isn't even about me anymore so i don't really care what people say about gnadi wasn't healthy this is going to happen every match that i have to every match that's been announced for me
SPEAKER_00: there will still be 50% of the people say that I'm going to get crushed. Even when the Lars match was announced way back when, they said Lars was going to flash me in the press. And then when the Camille match was announced, oh, Camille's way too strong for me. And then the Genadi match was announced. Oh, he's going to kill me. And then a lot of people with the Ermes says Ermes is going to kill me. You know, I'm used to it and I'm okay with it. I just know that the only thing that I can control is how hard I'm willing to work. As long as I put in the work and I bring my best version on that day,
SPEAKER_03: the best man win i mean we're all friends at the end of the day we're all friends right yeah yeah there's no doubt if we are not staying friends they just like sorry with f armresting if we are not staying friends you know just that that is not i mean arm wrestling is the thing that bringing us together you know you know that that that is you know more important you know i know you for 25 years almost
SPEAKER_03: 2000 for Hungary. February 2000. We're almost 25 years. February will be 25 years. Yeah, yeah. Ermes, do you agree with this guy? Do you agree with this guy? He says it's his time and you are one of those. He didn't say it that way, but I will just put the word in his mouth. He says you are the next victim.
SPEAKER_02: I will be the most dangerous opponent for him because now he fought with pressure and what he
SPEAKER_02: He felt what he feel more dangerous is what he have good hand control and transition to oppress. This is what I think he have more problem with the guys like me or Devon. I think he will beat me.
SPEAKER_02: He will for sure he will decide to fight with Leymah. If he will beat me, for sure he will decide to. Because really this is a very good fight for him and for me too. For me to restart after one year.
SPEAKER_00: is a very good test yeah yeah yeah i agree i think hermes is the toughest person i have faced in this i mean definitely the first toughest person i faced in his comeback he offers the most uh adversity he he's he has the hand strength he has a transition to a press he has all the tools it takes to be a bad opponent for me um i true i'm gonna say something that's gonna sound crazy but i'm gonna say it anyway
SPEAKER_00: I believe in my heart that Ermes is a more dangerous opponent for me than what Devon will be when I face Devon. Because your shape will be better at that time? My shape will be better when I face Devon, but my confidence, once I get through this match and I come out on top of this match, I believe my belief and faith in all the things that I'm saying will be so strong that when I get the opportunity to pull Devon,
SPEAKER_00: on that day and on that occasion, he will have to break me to beat me. And I don't think that was what's going to happen. I give a lot of... Like, I'm taking this match with Armas very, very, very serious because I realize how big of a threat he is. It's funny because a lot of people are like, you're going to kill him. You're going to do this. There's no way Armas can do this. And I'm like, guys, I don't understand. He was world champion when he was...
SPEAKER_00: The tiny little Ermes, right? And then y'all talk about him being a newcomer. Well, he wasn't a newcomer in 2016. He beat Trubin in the overalls of Zloty. Like he won the 89 kilogram class and then he beat Trubin in the overalls. Like he beat Rustam Babayev at the Zloty that year, right? So Ermes is a world champion many times before he became a super heavyweight.
SPEAKER_00: And you talked about this previously. The people who are very good super heavyweight arm wrestlers are the arm wrestlers who came up through the weight category and were proficient arm wrestlers on the way up. Not just some brute strength strong person. It's the guys who came up from the lighter weight classes who are now super heavyweights who are the most dangerous arm wrestlers. And Ermes represents that. I myself used to be 185 pounds, 198 pounds. So I came up through the weight classes as well. Yeah, you were 198 pounds when we pulled.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and you were 154. Yeah, 150 maybe, yeah. Well, you won all the classes, 154, 176, and fortunately on that day, I won the 98s. But listen, man. It was a tough match. It was a very tough match. It was a very tough match. Long match. My hand was controlled, but I had that side pressure pressed. I have more things to say. I think I pinged you at the first. They give you a foul or something, you know. Listen, I'll take what I can get. I'll take what I can get. But yeah, man.
SPEAKER_00: There's a lot riding on this match. And when I say Ermes is 31 and I'm 51, he can afford to lose this match. Like, he has plenty of time after this. Ermes, you hear that? You're young. You have so long time in front of you. Yeah, yeah. So many time. But what I needed to do about this, my friend, hanging...
SPEAKER_02: To give to him the victory without the fight. What I need to do. Okay. Okay. Another subject. I want to be my friend that happened despite the, you, I told you next year, you will fight the other two people. And next year we will go again with labor or me. Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Go ahead, Ian. I have a question, yeah. Ermes said that he doesn't want to pull Levan right after you. He says that he prepared well for you and he wants to prepare well for Levan again. But I remember that you were in a podcast.
SPEAKER_03: with Devon. And Devon was telling you that, hey, Michael, you need to rest a little bit and then get ready. But you seem like you want to pull the next one. If you are pulling Levan, if you beat Ermes, then it is most likely end of June, US. End of June? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so now I'm confused about your dates, because we know that the next event is... I know there's another event coming to the United States, right? So how are these things landing? So we do one event there, one event here. One event there, one event here. Okay, so there will be an event in between, you're saying? So this event will be in Georgia, then the next event will be in the United States. Yeah, and then Istanbul, and then America. So there'll be an... Okay.
SPEAKER_00: wow so they're you're telling me that i could let's say i beat hermes say your name again say your name is how do you say it how do you say your name i say it wrong aramis i had a match and i missed it i'm trying you say armies but now i'm like hermes i'm getting better i'm getting better um so this match with hermes then they'll be united states then they'll be istanbul then i wouldn't get to pull until the united states again
SPEAKER_00: So end of June is what you're saying? Yeah, probably in Arkansas, you know. Well, I know that. I mean, because we've discussed it, me, you, Robert. I mean, if this happens and I'm able to win this match, to be able to pull LeVon for the overall number of the world in my hometown will be the highlight of any person's career, right? Like, that's amazing. Yeah, LeVon wants to beat everyone in their homeland. Jerry there. He wants to beat Ermes in Italy. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah well there's no match in italy army so it has to be me that wins it has to be so there you go um yeah so end of june well i didn't know that that okay yeah 100 i want to pull in the end of june
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no. Devon't take everything I said, don't take it literally. Because the organizing events is kind of more complicated than just like having plans. You understand? We like to find a venue, negotiate and this. But that is the role plan. Yes. But if you lose the match, most likely Levan will be pulling La Letty.
SPEAKER_03: in may in i see what you're saying problems so we have a lot of contracts atlas until they all get their visas everything we really need to divide well here's the question real quick i'm waiting i'm waiting the message from michael tomorrow he will try to send me some money to have the victory
SPEAKER_02: He's waiting for a message tomorrow when I send him a proposal so that I pay him to let me win. What am I hearing, Hermas? Tomorrow he will send me a message to give me money to win the match.
SPEAKER_00: Because I won the match in my hometown, he thinks I'm going to send him money tomorrow or I'll make a proposal. It's funny, Joe. You have the victory with me. So here's the question. No, no, he says that you're going to pay him money to have victory. I didn't like the joke, but what to say. I didn't like the joke. Well, that makes sense why you kept asking. Okay, so here's the deal. If I win, would that mean it would still be in Istanbul in May?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, because one I went there, one I went here. We tell him to pull end of the year. Got you, LeVon. He wouldn't pull LeVon. That one is going to pull me. Devon't think about future, my friend. Devon't think about too much future. Exactly, exactly. So listen, every match right now, and I know you know this, every match is a way to learn, right? I've learned from every match I've had.
SPEAKER_00: This match with Irma is also going to be a learning experience. Hopefully I learn that everything that I'm doing in training is working and I'm on path to have a great outcome with LaVon. I expect this to be a phenomenal match. I don't know. I mean, I don't think it's going to be a fast match. I don't think I have a lane to blast right through him. And I don't necessarily think he has a lane to blast through me.
SPEAKER_00: So I think we're in for a really good match where you have two people who really, really, really want to win. And the one thing I like about... Well, it's not one thing. But there is one thing that I like about Ermes. And when he slips or when he's in a match or the match stops because of a foul, you see his emotion. He's a lot like me. He's a lot like Donati. He's very...
SPEAKER_00: He's very emotional on the table. Like when he feels victory, when he's in a match, he fights with a lot of passion, a lot of emotion. And I respect that. So I expect a very focused, strong Ermes across the table from me. That being said, I plan on winning. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I... Ermes. Who's winning? No doubt with my friend.
SPEAKER_02: There's no doubt? No doubt. I will joke this time. David Michael already send you the message? I really think it will be hard, but if we play good games technically, I think I will win for sure. I agree with Michael. I don't need to do mistake, only this.
SPEAKER_02: Genadi, I think he did many mistakes in his fight. I think Genadi did as good as he could. I think Genadi, on that day, I think he did everything he could. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But if you see when he pulled last time, it was better.
SPEAKER_03: It is not because he made a mistake. But just remember, Michael's first coming match, Genadi doesn't make any excuse. Genadi says Michael was better and that's all. But on that day, that is the best Genadi could do. But I agree with Michael's analysis. He said that riser and hand control is the key. If Michael really
SPEAKER_02: against the hand control, I think that you have a very hard day. I don't really see this thing in my mind. My hand was stronger when I fought with him two, eight years ago, and I fought with Trubin, with Devon.
SPEAKER_02: I said many times it was about set-up. Yes, they were super strong. It was better than this day, but it was more about set-up. I don't feel too good. I was not ready. It's not an excuse, but it's the reality what I think. After this, I started to train like crazy. My hand, my wrist, everything. Because I was more strong in the arm and my hand, it was...
SPEAKER_02: less. And with Vitalii, I saw a lot improvement. And I never stopped to train my hand, my rising, everything. Never stopped from now until now. And really, really, I feel very good, very confident about this.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I want to say my opinion. Like, again, you think it's possible, not what is different. You guys go back. If Michael takes your hand, it will be very hard evening for you. Yes. If you guys are in an equal position, then if you take his wrist,
SPEAKER_03: then I think your chance is higher. But it doesn't mean that he's not going to resist. As long as his hand doesn't touch the pad, there is a chance for Michael because he can resist. But if you take his wrist, your chance will be higher because Kamil and Genadi, they both go to do his arm, you know, and Michael had the wrist.
SPEAKER_03: so if you have the wrist and then if you are applying the far side of his hand then your chance is higher that that is how i see but we don't know whose hands survive whose riser survives we will see that day but i think this wrist riser here is the really key point for your match
SPEAKER_00: I think we all agree. I mean, I'm training that, he's training that. We're training it slightly differently. You know, he's training it more traditionally, more conventionally. I'm training more that applies to how I arm wrestle, right? So it will come down to hand and wrist. Okay, so like you said, if he has, he can have everything and I still have a small chance of winning.
SPEAKER_00: But if I have everything, I don't think he has a chance of winning. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's very hard. But the likelihood is... Listen, listen. When you are saying this, Ermes goes... Well, listen. A lot of people are talking about Ermes' press. And Ermes has one of the best transitional presses in the game. But not fake. Not fake press. No, no, no. Not a flop press. Now, he does have it. You've seen him do it against Vitalii. You've seen him do it against Dave Chafee. We've seen him do it. But he first...
SPEAKER_00: Well, stop with the pronator and then he goes. Oh, no, I'm not trying to, but if he has to flop, press me to beat me, he can't beat me. No offense. He has to have my hand. He has to have my hand. He has to climb over my hand and he has to press me. If you try to flop, press me to pin me.
SPEAKER_00: you're falling into a trap and you're going to lose. You're going to lose. I don't think I'm flop-press pinnable anymore. I don't think you can pin me in a flop-press. I don't think Jerry can do it. I don't think LeVon can do it. I don't think anyone can flop-press me. But you can press me if you take my hand. Like, if you take my hand, which is how he was able to do it previously, that's the path. That's what makes him so dangerous. But Gasparini couldn't press you. Gasparini took your hand, couldn't, because he didn't have strong press, probably.
SPEAKER_00: Well, yeah, I mean, Ernie is this phenomenal tactician. He's very technically sound. And he has all the right tools. Like, he's a very, very dangerous person for me specifically. And I'm taking all that into consideration. Now, here's a question for you that neither one of us have asked because neither one of us are considering this because we both expect to win. So I'm going to ask you... The question is to me? The question is to you. Okay. The person who does not win this match...
SPEAKER_03: What does their next match look like? Listen, we all will talk. We listen. None of us. I mean, you seem to say, how does that person who loses by the way back to the title? Michael, like, like, this is not the ego satisfaction. Do I know I'm missing? Pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You know our messaging. Ermes knows our messaging. They would know that. We all know our messaging. We will find the best possible, like most logical match. It can be anything. But you are a very nice person that you are thinking of Ermes already. See, I'm a good guy. Oh, my friend. He's already in his mind. If you think like this, you're already in his mind to lose.
SPEAKER_02: I'm trying to find out who he has to beat to get back to the title. Michael is looking for his next match, Ermes? That's why he's curious? Yeah, he's looking for the losing round, losing match. So real quick on that note, that's the thing. Ermes says, I can do it next year. I can pull LeVon next year. The person who loses this match probably doesn't get a shot at LeVon next year.
SPEAKER_03: No, it depends if you continue beating. You need to win another two matches. What's your rank now? Fifth. Devon't change if you lose with me. I'm second, third. You don't lose position. You will win another two matches. People who are ranked above you, we know who they are. Losing a match to number three in the world,
SPEAKER_03: I mean, or Ermes losing to you and becoming number five. It's just like you are not really going out of top 10 or something. You know still who is in front of you. So beating two of the guys, beating two of the guys ahead of you will give you the match. Yeah, so it won't move him to fifth. It'll move him to fourth. Jerry will drop to fifth. I will go to third. Ermes will go to fourth. Jerry will drop to fifth.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So he won't go to fifth. He only drops one spot. Like, I mean, seriously. Why are you worrying then? It's no bad whatsoever. Like still number four. I mean, that's still pretty good. Wow, we have almost a thousand people watching us live. A thousand people.
SPEAKER_00: Good, good guy. Hey, Michael, how do you see the cards, TBC cards so far? So far, it looks amazing. You keep announcing new matches. Hey, so I like Frank versus Sergey Kalinichenko. I like that match a lot. And that's 115? Is that at 115? Yes, yes. I think Frank, Frank's a bad dude. I put it yesterday.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I saw the practice. He's very good at tape now, really. He told me he's following a diet, he's training a lot. His triceps look big. His triceps look big. Yeah, really. I saw him super big. I never saw him big like this. Never.
SPEAKER_00: yeah i like that i think he's best shape of his life really right and that's exciting because if if we didn't have east versus west he would not be so committed to his training he would just be normal frank who just goes to the tournaments and does whatever and does his job east versus west has provided a platform for athletes to really find out how good they can be you know that's exciting because i mean listen i i i won't be humble
SPEAKER_03: we had never had something like this versus us i'm talking about the rankings and then bringing 95 of the elite arm masters and right now like it is not like a few super matches we really like it is the ufc of arm wrestling but of course we are way behind but but that that is the system we created all together and everything will be uh much better who's winning attaching for iraq
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I love Irakli, but I've got to say Todd. I've got to say Todd. You think Irakli? Yeah. I'm not going to get too much. He's very good. He's very good. But, man, Todd Hutchings is just like, he's so crazy. You know, like, he's so crazy strong. I don't know, man. I like it. I like that match a lot. I like that match a lot.
SPEAKER_03: So you are saying that Ermes is going to win and you are saying that Tad is going to win. I'm telling you, if Ermes goes with the back pressure, the guy is losing that match. If Ermes can control Tad's pronator, then there's a chance. Because you take Tad's hand, if he has the pronator, I mean he will hit you. I think also without the pronator, too much back pressure.
SPEAKER_03: He has too much power, back pressure. Back pressure, you're talking about Irakli? Yeah. Yeah, but back pressure, when you do back pressure, what are you going to do? You're going to lift the guy's elbow? No, no, no, no. He has back pressure inside. He has this movement super strong now. Yeah, yeah, but you need to have this. If you don't have this, and if you go like this, pronator to pronator,
SPEAKER_03: The side pressure of Todd, listen, a lot of people, they make the same mistake. They try to take his hand. You must not take his hand. I'm not saying that let him hook you, but you need to, I mean, control his pronator. If you don't cut this, if you don't turn here, like here, how much can you press? And here, how much can you press? Todd can probably press like this more than Enouaz is doing this press. You know, he's just so strong to the side.
SPEAKER_00: He's very strong. Yeah. I want to keep going on our opinions on the upcoming matches, but I also want to go ahead and put an invitation out to Ermes. After our match, he's welcome to come over to the United States and help me train for LeBron. For me?
SPEAKER_02: Thank you so much, my friend. Start to train to prepare spaghetti, pizza, and it will be amazing for me. Ermes, do you know what you are saying right now? You're out of your mind. No, no, no. I will go for training myself for Levan. And then he will cook the pasta, pizza, spaghetti, everything for me to grow up myself.
SPEAKER_03: Not quite what I said, but hey, whatever. I understand very well, my friend. Too smart now. Too much. Okay, Ermes, David Dadikyan versus Alex Kurdecha. A lot of people think that Dadikyan
SPEAKER_03: doesn't have chance, but Dadikyan, only even when he was 114 kilo, he beat Artem Morozov three times in a row. And in the later rounds, he lost 4-3. I'm not saying that Dadikyan is favorite, but I think that match is much closer because he has strong hand. Exactly. His hand is unbelievable, really. I think his hand really, the finger, everything,
SPEAKER_02: And he will go with the straps. It will be a hard time for Kurdecha. But I think Kurdecha is a little bit favorite this match. The size difference? Size... He has very good endurance, I saw last time.
SPEAKER_00: He did very good against Morozov. Gerdette did an amazing job against Morozov. And I hate to cut Irma's off on this. The sheer violence of Dadikyan makes me think he's the favorite. That is one violent individual on the table. Like, he's so damn aggressive. And I just think he might could put him in a bad position so fast that the match is over with. It's just this thing that he beat Tata Shinks when he was 105 kilos.
SPEAKER_03: Here, my guess, he will be around 125 kilo. So I think that he will be around 275 pounds. So for sure that 20 kilo, he will be stronger. And so, Ed, do you remember when Taz tried to go to Strap?
SPEAKER_03: couldn't his hand is really dominant so alex is also going outside so i think that is like anything can happen both hands very strong i think alex left arm is also stronger than his right hand he also has a press left-handed we've we've seen alex press left-handed so alex has options i'm just saying round one it could be so explosive from datican that
SPEAKER_00: Kurdecha has no idea what just happened. He's like, what the hell? So he has to change his game plan. I'm excited. You know, he says Kurdecha is a slight favorite and that might be the case, but I think it's 50-50. I think that's an amazing match. I mean, another amazing match you put together. Love it. Yeah. And who's winning? I think that I can. Fia or Malin? So Malin beat Fia at WAL, right? Those are different rules, different everything else. Fia is amazing. Amazing.
SPEAKER_03: But I say 55-45 Malin. I think same. So you are saying that Malin is the favorite? Wow. I think Malin beat her in the WL. Yeah. Brad. Flash pins. Like, nice. Wow. Right now, FIA under 70 kilo looks...
SPEAKER_00: I don't know who beats under 70. I don't think there is a person. But this is under 70. Is it really? Malin's cutting to 70? Yes. This is 70 kilo world title match. Oh, shit. I don't know. Malin might be the one. Malin's bad. I don't think I've seen her 70. When's the last time she was 70? In 2018, well, she won 65 kilo. David she really? Yeah. Damn. Damn.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, man. I still think Malin's a favorite. That's crazy. And the fact that they're both Swedish and they're both world champions, that's a hell of a match. And very close friends. Very good friends. Oh, my God, yes.
SPEAKER_03: No, 70%, but I think 55, maybe like this. That's what I said, 55-45, I think, Marlon. Or 50-50. And there is another interesting match, very interesting match. Like, Bacho Bacho Saginashvili, this young guy, really gave huge trouble to Reno in Dubai. Really big trouble, you know? And, like, stylistically, Reno was the worst person for Bacho. They was going to his bicep.
SPEAKER_03: while Bacho's hand looked very dominant. But now he's pulling against an American. Normally, like these Eastern guys are usually like favorite, unless the other guy is 50, 55 years old. You know what I mean? But whenever you see Brett Grundy beating Pablo,
SPEAKER_03: and beating Matt Mask, then you are like, hmm. So this is a big question mark for me. So here's my opinion. Bacho is still probably the favorite.
SPEAKER_00: If Brad Grundy shows up in his top form, which is the Pablo form, the Matt Mass form, that kid is a very good arm wrestler. He's got a very good setup. He's got a great top roll. He's very perfect. Good hand control, everything. Very, very good. He's not going to be as explosive as Bacho. Not even close. But if he comes in that form, I'd say it's 55-45 Bacho.
SPEAKER_00: If he comes in less than that, it's 80-20, Bacho. Yeah, I don't know. He went to train and Chan sent me a video. He said, Angel, Brad is ready. Oh, he is? Okay. And he was two weeks ago. Yeah, Brad's funny because he retires, he starts back, he retires, he starts back. He's going to school to be a doctor or something. The kid's very intelligent, very good kid. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: and he just can't make up his mind about what he wants to do. But if he's serious about this match, he's got a shot. He has got a legitimate shot. He's got a legitimate shot. I still think Baccio's a favorite, but I think he's got a legitimate shot. Ermes? Brad has a very good top row, I saw with Matt Mask. Super dangerous. But I feel... To control Matt like this? Yeah, I think Baccio too much arm power.
SPEAKER_02: I think Bacho's hand is very strong. Hand and wrist is very strong. Yeah. Yeah. I think Bacho is favorite. I think maybe it will be, maybe it will be very dominant. Wow. Like if they are in strap or something, that guy, you look at him, you think you're going to destroy him. You know, he just looks very calm. Not, not any.
SPEAKER_03: like intimidation, like nothing, you know, you just look at him, like his arms are not really like big muscular or something, but like incredible hand control, perfect technique, you know. Yeah, for this, yes. We will see. Okay, we have another great match. I convinced Oleg Petrenko to go down to 95 kilos against Petr Kivic. And Oleg Petrenko, when he was 95 kilos, he beat Petr.
SPEAKER_03: David at the last at 95 kilo. Oleg Petrenko is the person, in my opinion, gave the hardest match together with Ivan Matushenko to Malin Canmurado. I know that these guys know how to cut weight. I think that competition day, he will be over 220. Michael, how do you see, Betkili is also very strong. How do you see this match?
SPEAKER_03: i am a huge bet keely fan huge why is that why is that because he's so calm and cool and like he is so impressive i never saw him as mine yeah he looked very unhappy he looked very bored he is like what am i doing here you know like look that way yeah when he beat when he beat tayanov i stood out of my seat i couldn't believe it
SPEAKER_00: For him to be tan all the way he beats head off. And then what he just did to Oleg, I thought he would do that to Oleg. Um, but I'm gonna be honest. The only thing that makes me think he might win this match is because it's in Tbilisi. Other than that, I'm Oleg Petrenko all day long. Petrenko is a stud. His left arm is ridiculous. I think, I think he would be the favorite. If it wasn't, this will be the, the, like, like determining factor will be endless.
SPEAKER_00: Or do you think that one can dominate the other one? This is for sure. I like the way Ermes thinks it could very well come to endurance. Yeah, I don't think Michael can flash him. I don't think he can. I think Petrenko's too solid, too rigid.
SPEAKER_00: know man that's that's a phenomenal when i saw that match i got real excited you know because i it hurt my feelings to see how bad devin beat petrenko right here it really did it hurt my feelings because i really respect because he's part of the push card you know camp and i love push card everybody over there so it hurt but i will tell you something one of those rounds that
SPEAKER_03: uh i think it really wasn't easy they want to pin no it wasn't next day next day devon said that his his chest was hurting it is because of that that you know of course yeah the pressure here that he was sore here you know yeah i i hate to vote against the georgian because i love the georgians um but i would love to see petrinko have another world title and i think he's got a shot and how do you see hermes uh finger really 50 50.
SPEAKER_02: But, uh, I think, uh, I love, uh, too much, uh, Petrenko, but, uh, I think, uh, but he's favorite 55. Hmm. Amazing. How big of an impact, how big of an impact do you think is going to be arm wrestling in front of your, your Georgian crowd? If you're Georgian. I mean, I, I think that they, they, they will really like it. I mean, I.
SPEAKER_03: I'm the type of person I like to control emotions until the goal comes. When the goal comes, it's violence, you know. But I don't want to go to the table like,
SPEAKER_03: I want to go like a chess player. I have everything in me, but I don't want to get out. I don't want to lose the control. So I'm not sure if it affects me good to put in front of my own people, but a lot of people like this. A lot of people like to, because you know, Michael, I used to live in America six, seven years.
SPEAKER_03: And every event I went, I was the only Turkish guy. Referees are American, opens are American. I'm so used to, you know. But I don't know how they will get affected, but I think they are emotional people. I think they will like it. I think so. I think so. And that makes every Georgian on the card, if it's a 50-50 match, it makes it 51-49 for the Georgians. You know what I'm saying? Because the hometown just makes it crazy. Yeah, but Michael, actually, the other day I made a post
SPEAKER_03: and like almost all of these guys are wafflers you know like but they all pull in last 10 years you understand so what i'm just saying that in fact you know these are the same great guys
SPEAKER_03: with different rules, you know what I mean? But the same guys with more spotlight on them. So that is exactly what I wanted to do, that these guys are really heroes of armwrestling, but nobody really knew because you understand it wasn't professional. Anyway, so let's go to another great, great, great, great one.
SPEAKER_03: And, you know, when Oleg Zhokh pulled against Petrenko, Oleg was also very near 90 kilos. But this event is 85 kilos. So Oleg Zhokh is pulling Daniel Prokopchuk. And Prokopchuk, in my opinion, will be also very near to 85, maybe 82 or something. And I wouldn't underestimate Prokopchuk, you know. Prokopchuk is really, really, really strong guy. So how do you guys see? Do you guys see Zhokh? Because...
SPEAKER_02: Prokopchuk is 77 kilo lightweight champion and welterweight champion is Oleg Zhokh, so he's going for his second title to another category. How do you guys see it? Do you guys think that Prokopchuk has a chance or not? I see Oleg, the size of the hand. Prokopchuk has two small hands, it's very difficult to control.
SPEAKER_02: you know, to supinate very well. I see Oleg to go in front with the elbow and to control everything what he did every time. I think Zorc will win.
SPEAKER_02: Do you see a dominance or do you see a war? Maybe a little bit in the beginning, but I think because Zog with Batkiri did a very good job last time. Yeah, but he will be a little bit lighter. I saw Zog very strong.
SPEAKER_02: be very close fight but i think i put the 60 65 tools on this fight and michael you agree yeah i think um outside the strap uh for chop daniel has no chance
SPEAKER_00: If he can get to the strap, I get a 35% chance. 35%, okay. Yeah, I just think, like he said, the sheer size of Oleg's hand and wrist, when you're trying to supinate it from such a short lever, small hand, even with the strap connection, I think it's going to be very difficult. Now, Daniel's joint lock and strength is stupid. So, I mean, he could put enough bleed on Oleg's bicep. It might take him several rounds to do it.
SPEAKER_03: But it could end up being a 4-3 Daniel. But I'm saying there's only 35% chance of that. I think it's 4-0 Oleg. I understand. And let's go, let's go, let's go. This one I only ask for percentage, not the analyzing. Michael Todd versus Ermes Gasparini. 100% Michael Todd is too strong.
SPEAKER_02: zero chance zero chance for hermes he lived too much weight unbelievable never so personal strong person like him really i knew i liked hermes he sure is a good guy honestly man um 51 49 michael todd
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I just think the match is a very highly contested match between two guys who... Yes, yes. We both know what we need to do. Like, we both know exactly what we need to do. It's just who on that day can do it, you know? And I just, I do think it's going to be me. How much does it have to do with the preparation and how much does it have to do with the performance on that day?
SPEAKER_00: So here I'm going back into my faith. I believe that I'm doing something that's greater than me. So I have one responsibility and that's to do the work. So in this preparation, I'm doing all the work that I set a program. I'm doing all the work. I'm treating myself like an athlete. On the day of the match and at the day of the press conference, I don't have any pressure. I don't have any anxiety. I don't have any stress. I just feel like.
SPEAKER_00: just feel like it's my time so on that day um the work that will have been done in preparation will will show on the table it will manifest itself on the table um i don't know man uh the thing is it sucks because i like my opponents a lot you know what i mean like it would be a lot easier and i know we don't change too much if you kiss me
SPEAKER_02: I like the fact that he, you know, he taught me whatever you want, but don't change it. Yeah. It won't change. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Michael is going to win a hundred percent. So I mean, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: i mean i like the fact that he is i appreciate these i mean i think shame yeah i mean the thing is somebody has to lose one of us and it's not our dreams are gonna get crushed it's just we're gonna have a setback right one of us is gonna have a setback and have to go back to drawing board and reevaluate um like i said man i just uh i feel it deep in my heart that that
SPEAKER_00: It's my time. I mean, I can't say anything else. I'm not saying that it's me that I'm great or I deserve it. I just say that I think that right now I'm in a special place. And I think it's going to show. My friend, next year you'll be stronger. You'll be stronger. You'll have a better time next year. Next year he will be defending his title a lot more? No, no. He will try with Levan. No, with me, sorry. With me. That's it.
SPEAKER_00: okay try with me next year yeah there we go oh because you're gonna be you're saying oh he was saying with lavon but now he's saying he's gonna beat me that he's gonna beat lavon so then i've had to face him again i got it i see what you're saying now i get it i get it okay hermes you are familiar with this guy vasily davutashvili versus doyan golemonov do you know vasily yeah yeah and
SPEAKER_02: It's very hard, because Golemanov, top pro, legend, really super technically. About power, we will see, I think, 50-50, more or less. It's difficult to say something about people who don't pull too much.
SPEAKER_00: And Michael, do you know Vasily Dautashvili? Yeah, yeah. I like Stoyan a lot. He's amazing. I go back to Vasily's match with John Brzezink at the top eight thing for the 95 kg thing. That kid's super impressive. Just watching him train. I mean, like Irma says, it's hard to make an educated guess on two people who don't have enough data. But my personal opinion is Vasily is probably 55-45.
SPEAKER_00: Hmm. 55, 45 for who? Vasily. How do you say his name? Vasily. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I mean, he's Georgian. It's in Georgia. I already told you. I understand. So you are saying that basically if the match looks evenly. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You give it a little bit more chance for the home guy. I mean, I just think that I think the environment, honestly, I think this will be out every East versus West and even the king of the table we just had. The environment is amazing. The atmosphere is amazing. I truly think as much as I love the United States events, I truly think this event may be the most outrageous, passionate crowd we've ever seen. Is that true that the Georgians' sound was
SPEAKER_00: like louder than the americans during the jerry versus levan match there was some good georgian representation there there was some good georgian representation i'm gonna be honest like there might have been 50 75 georgians in the crowd i don't know it's like like 10 of the georgians uh like yeah i mean imagine imagine in georgia like how many people do you think how many tickets you're gonna sell
SPEAKER_03: My guess is minimum 1,000 up to 2,000. I think so. I think you might sell 2,000 tickets. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: This may be the largest paid crowd outside of what they're doing in India. I think this may be the largest paid crowd arm wrestling has ever seen in the strongest arm wrestling country in the world. I don't think that there is any city in the world that arm wrestling is as popular as it is in Tbilisi. Well, look who they have. I mean, they have four champions, but they have Levan. I go around with Levan with the car.
SPEAKER_03: Like you see, you wait at the traffic lights, even people walk in or in another car, they are like, I live on, I live on, everywhere, you know, he's just a very, very famous guy. Anyway, so, okay, let's go Vitalii Laletin versus Artem Morozov.
SPEAKER_03: This is a match that people, like, has been putting pressure on me for a while. Why you don't give Laletin a shot? Laletin is the number one contender. Like, a lot of people say he's number one. And...
SPEAKER_03: If this event would be in U.S., Laletin would have visa problems. There would be Devon versus Morozov match there. But since it is here, every time the event is here, we need to make sure that the Eastern athletes, top athletes get their matches here because they may not get visa for the other events. So how do you guys see this match? How do you guys... And I think that...
SPEAKER_03: Morozov is also seriously like whenever I see Morozov against Kurdecha I didn't see him big and Kurdecha was really big and I expected Kurdecha to want that but somehow even without Serb he was able to hook Laletin so hooking Laletin is probably harder than hooking Kurdecha but what's your opinion?
SPEAKER_02: If you ask to me, the first thing, it will be like right arm. Same. You think left arm will be the same? I think Lali will be favorite for sure. But I don't know if Lali is strong, like left or right is the same power. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I saw some interview, he said the left is a bit less strong, but it's amazing really. For me, Laletin is number one, for sure. I put 60-40 Laletin. But it will be different like last time with the right. So you are saying 60-40?
SPEAKER_02: If Morozov can stop him, I put Morozov to win, for sure. Depends if he can stop the start. Which position he needs to stop him?
SPEAKER_02: The only position you can stop Laletin is what I did with him last year. There is another position. If you try to hook him, you are crazy. You are crazy if you try to hook him. Or to press, I think not. Or top rolls, start top rolls.
SPEAKER_03: i disagree with you about the press i mean because camille did it huh camille did it left-handed left arm and then like someone like jerry like i don't think they're like here if you want to pray but i i speak about i talk about uh
SPEAKER_00: Okay, gotcha. So I'm with the same belief that Irma is. Vitalii, although Morozov has had amazing title defenses, until we see these two face, Vitalii's the favorite. The only way I see Vitalii winning is if he wins just like he did right-handed. He flash pins him four times on the pad. If Morozov stops the match, goes outside, slips, gets the strap, puts the brakes on him, but feeds his bicep, Morozov wins.
SPEAKER_00: Vitalii wins, it's 4-0, and it's flash pins. Exactly. Or he's so much stronger, and he hits and just keeps his position, and then pins him. But I think it's four flash pins, or he loses. Yeah, I mean, I think that when he pulled with him, like right arm,
SPEAKER_03: I can't believe, like he tried hook and the last ones, he wanted to match his speed. There is no way. There is no way that you're going to have an equal start with Vitalii Laletin, you're stopping him. You need to do like Ermes did, you need to load, load, load, load, load, load, and then stop him, maybe. But if you don't load until you go to someone like Morozov.
SPEAKER_03: Morozov is one of the slowest guys I have ever seen. He's very strong, but not fast. How can you do that? He could start with Ladezin. Until you reach your 70, Ladezin is going to hit you with his 100. So you need to load, load, load, and then come to your 95 or 100 already before the goal.
SPEAKER_03: And then maybe they can stop him. But before they go, if you're not loading, you're not stopping the lesson. I'm going to argue one point. I think that I could possibly stop him without loading.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but the way that you pull is different. I know. But you said it's impossible without loading, so I just think it's possible. While you have time till here. This is where you want to stop him. Right. I mean, Vitalii is someone who I would love to arm wrestle. Like, honestly. Can you imagine three years we have been heading to Supermatches and look how many more
SPEAKER_00: opportunities we have. A lot of things, you know. Yeah, there's so many matches out there. Devon and Vitalii? Oh my god. Devon will load like you loaded.
SPEAKER_02: Devon will load and he'll cheat the setup. He'll do everything he has to do. And I don't think he gets flashed. I think he stops it. It depends if he has enough arm power to stop. You need to have back pressure like crazy to stop this monster.
SPEAKER_00: he is such he's a freak like i i really like vitality a lot he's a good dude um i'm gonna be up so i've watched a bunch of his matches now the matches that i like the most are like when freed osmali beat him at amc and uh not those are not the ones i like the most i mean i like you beating him i like the matches i'm just saying the matches that register and i remember are the way free did it otherwise did it i think those lanes you know you know the amc match
SPEAKER_00: was exactly two weeks after he pulled yeah again i didn't i i don't care about his form i'm just saying the lane the lane that's available in those matches would be how i would have to win like i'd have to open up for me to beat vitality i'm gonna have to stop him low most likely and and gas him which you know art is gonna be to stop that explosive long reliever crazy dude like it's gonna be a i don't know i would love the match i would love to try that i mean it would be a good interesting challenge to see
SPEAKER_00: what i could do with him because he is so proficient and he is so long levered but i do believe he'd have to come way off my knuckle because his arm's so long so he'd have to low hand top row me i don't know man it'd be interesting let's go devon versus gennady is that the main event
SPEAKER_03: Oh, we will, we will decide, you know, normally it is the super heavyweight match or title match, you know, just, that's what I thought. Vitalii versus Morozov. It just, no one Devon's on the card. He often is the main event, you know, he wasn't in Orlando cause he pulled chance, but yeah. Yeah. It's interesting. Yeah. The thing is whenever I go to, uh,
SPEAKER_03: Like I set this match two months before the Tbilisi event. So he pulled against you, then one and a half months later, this match was set. So I was thinking that probably he didn't train that time and he will have two months.
SPEAKER_03: But when I traveled to Tbilisi, what I saw, that wasn't the case. That one and a half months, he kept training. And Devon made a video, like,
SPEAKER_03: Genadi's fat belly or something, but there was like probably cell phone and other things in front of him. He was like, seriously, he was thinner. And the guy who translated for us, Alex, he also, we were going to eat outside, Genadi walking faster, like backside, you could see he was like this. You could see his back muscles, you know, like visible from the hoodie.
SPEAKER_03: Anyway, so you can see that he didn't stop. He trained. At least, just say, if he rested two weeks, and then he trained another month. And now, after I said this match, he had another two months.
SPEAKER_03: he for sure will be in better shape than his Istanbul shape. But will he be in the same shape that he pulled against Devon in May 2023, while Devon is saying that he will be in his best shape ever? So we don't know. But the only thing I can say, like when you are talking about Genadi Kuvikbine,
SPEAKER_03: Like you can't say that this guy doesn't have a chance. You know what I'm saying? Because you're talking about Genadi Kvikvinia. You don't know, he goes to the stage, 185 centimeters, then sometimes he becomes 2.5 meters, you know. He looks that way, you know. He just more open up, more he grows, you know. And he will be in front of his people. And I know that he's getting ready like crazy, whatever necessary.
SPEAKER_03: I know how good Devon is and even how good Devon was in their first match. It was very close. On the paper, I also told this to Genadi. I said, no disrespect, but Devon looks a little bit favored. He just disagrees. What are your opinions?
SPEAKER_02: I saw a video, and I haven't heard your prediction, but I saw someone say that you predicted Genadi. So is that true? No, no. I told you Genadi. I'm talking about Ermes. I'm talking about Ermes. Oh, sorry, sorry. Yeah, yeah, because for sure it will be better shape than when I thought with Michael.
SPEAKER_02: It's not because I want to disrespect your victory, but when I saw Genadi in Istanbul, I saw him very... It's not the same when I saw him in very good shape, but it was the arm a little bit... Not solid, you know what I mean. And the show from video is...
SPEAKER_02: bigger now and is the most dangerous opponent for Devon, him or Camille. Devon, his weakness, most dangerous weakness of Devon is the press. I saw in the history.
SPEAKER_02: But you also saw your practice matches with Devon. Once he stopped you, you could dive in with the press. I mean, it's a lane that's available if you can stop the match, right? If you can stop the match, the press is valid. Exactly. And I think Genadi is very smart. He has a lot of technique. They want to, but Genadi, now he will know better what to do next time.
SPEAKER_02: It's very hard. It's very hard to predict because I think it's 50-50, but I put a little bit favorite Genadi because he will fight in his city, Georgia. He will have energy like crazy. He's definitely going to feed off the crowd. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He will have super energy for this fight.
SPEAKER_02: And really, I respect him like crazy. A very big boss. He take a match without to think too much. Incredible fighter. Genadi is one of my favorite. And you? I'm going to start off. Will we see a more subdued Devon Larratt because it's in Georgia?
SPEAKER_00: because he won't want to irritate that Georgian crowd by talking as much stuff as he normally talks? Or do you think it's just going to make it, it's going to be worse? Is he going to talk worse because he's in Georgia? What do you think is going to happen? Talking about Devon? Yeah. You mean like talking trash?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, in the press conference. It will be super dangerous. I will be ready to go out, my friend. I'm with you, homie. I'm grabbing her back and we're leaving. I will be ready to go out. Yeah. I mean, that's what I'm saying. I don't know if Devon is going to be... No, no, no. They have a lot of pride. A lot of country pride, you know what I mean? And Devon can get underneath your skin. You know what I'm saying? So...
SPEAKER_00: i don't know how that's going to play out because you know the press conference is going to get heated it always does and then you know the match itself is going to get heated um in my opinion when you asked the first question engen was will gannati be as strong as he was in their previous match i believe yes i believe he'll be as strong as he was maybe even stronger wow but i also think devin is going to be stronger than he was okay okay the question is is it even possible like after coming that bicep
SPEAKER_03: But you became, you became. I'm a perfect example of what's possible. But do you think that like, does it have to do with the time or does it have to do with the procedure, you know, process? Like you had Lamparelli, Lars, Kamil, Genadi, you know,
SPEAKER_00: And while he only had your match and then now this second match, do you think that he needed more events, more matches, or it doesn't matter? So in my opinion, he has probably the best opportunity to train with the best arm wrestlers in the world in his backyard, right? Like he has the Georgian team that he has access to. They don't train together. Do they not? None of them?
SPEAKER_00: Um, some of them. Yeah. Okay. Well, maybe not. So I don't know, man. I just think, yes, I think he'll be, I think, I think we all know how to trip. So listen, I, Arm is, is doing all this stuff he's doing and he's doing table time. And I think that's great. I think arm wrestlers table, the best thing to do for arm wrestling is to arm wrestle me personally. I'm not on the table in this prep.
SPEAKER_00: I'm just trying to get stronger. I know how to arm wrestle. I've been doing this for 35 years. Well, just because you know, does it mean that you can have this same training, same endurance at the table? You don't do any table at all? I've done nothing this whole prep. And you will not do? Perfect. Yeah, I mean... Maybe one? Maybe tomorrow with Corey. He's coming tomorrow. But the thing is, I didn't do any training for Genadi either. I didn't get on the table at all.
SPEAKER_00: I think Genadi can be the strongest Genadi has ever been without having to spend a bunch of time on the table. If he trusts his surgeon, if he trusts his rehab, if he believes that he's strong so much. We all know this is the strongest thing we have. Your mind is the strongest thing you have. We're all strong. Every one of us are strong, way stronger than the average human.
SPEAKER_00: what separates is this the belief in faith that you can do something like when you when you've done the work and you know you're strong if you believe you can win that's a big part of it Genadi will believe and sometimes I'm like how can he be so confident because he's pulling Devon you know something like
SPEAKER_00: It's hard to be that confident when Devon's across the table. That's not a guy you know you have to face. Because Devon is different. Devon is just different. There's something about him that makes him different. And he's a very difficult person to prepare for. I think Devon's the favorite. But what Ermes said, it's a close match. He gives the edge to Genadi because of the home crowd. I'm telling you, I think that home crowd is going to make a difference.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, here's how I think it happens. Devon has to destroy him. He has to destroy him. You don't think that he can dominate? If he gets in a match and it becomes a heart match, it becomes one of these matches in the heart, Genadi's going to feed off that crowd and the same shit's going to happen again. Can I ask you something? The rounds that stopped against Genadi, like... Round one.
SPEAKER_03: Round one, he was playing around a few months. Oh, me? No, no. I think there was more than round one. The rounds that he won also was, like, long, you know, right? Yeah, but I'm just saying. What did you feel? David you feel the guy, you know, like, how to say, like, he had the, what was missing with him? What was still there?
SPEAKER_00: You're talking about my match with Genadi? Yeah. Like, for example, the round one, he just, boom, his wrist just went. Yeah, I took his hand round one, and that was my goal. Round two, I took his hand again, and then it went back, and then it came back. And I thought, hey, I could hold you as long as I want right here. But I want to get the pin. So once I came up from here to here, I started opening up lanes that were available for me to lose.
SPEAKER_00: There were no lanes here. Once I came up, the press was available. He didn't press my Kings move. He pressed me when I was trying to get positioned to transition myself. I'm not talking about the match with me and Genadi. Genadi did a great job. I know, I know. What I'm just saying is, did you feel that he can be very, very dangerous with three and a half months preparation? What I feel is Genadi pulls a lot of emotion with a lot of heart.
SPEAKER_00: And if he's in front of that town, if he's in his home country, and there's 2,000 or 1,000-plus Georgians screaming Genadi, Opana, Opana, unless Devon destroys him and takes away his spirit to win immediately, you don't let Genadi get in the match. If Genadi gets in that match, and he yells Opana, and he's in it, in that crowd, Devon may have dug himself a big asshole that he can't get out of.
SPEAKER_00: But if Devon is smart, which I know he is, he needs to get the match done quickly. Whenever I listen to him now, I don't see that. Whenever I see him, he wants to make him quit. He wants to make him quit. And you're not going to make him quit in that crowd. You're not going to make him quit. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: don't think so what do you think armies is it gonna make him quit in that crowd no no no no i don't think it's possible in some some bottle will come something yeah it's it's gonna get i mean listen like army says it's it's 50 50 whether i'm still there or not like i might have to grab rebecca and go i don't know what's gonna happen it's gonna get crazy okay i want to see it i want to see it because
SPEAKER_00: It's going to be one hell of a spectacle for sure. But I just can't wait to see that crowd. The Georgians love arm wrestling. And you put together an amazing card. I'm sure you still have some more matches to go. It's going to be an amazing card. This event is finalized. 11 matches. That's it. That's it. Okay. So those are all the matches.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah I mean it's exciting it's exciting it's a great opportunity yeah to showcase the highest level of arm wrestling um it's fun like you got Genadi number six Devon number two going against each other you got arm is number three me number five going against each other you got the number one guy left-handed going against I guess the number two guy in Vitalii I mean and then you have more world title match it's amazing it's an amazing card and just to know that
SPEAKER_03: The winner between me and Armez gets the shot at Levan. It's just the icing on the cake to whoever wins that match. He's been nice to you now, Armez. He's been nice to you. Whenever he says the winner of us or something, he means that me facing Levan will be nice. Can I ask you something? What kind of feeling do you think it will be when you rank number three? Wow.
SPEAKER_02: I like to do this to Ermes. Ermes never gets upset with me. I'm not happy to be number three. What? He will not? I'm not happy to be number three, my friend. Oh, okay. Yeah, but if you're number five and then number three, then he would be... I mean... No, no. It's out of my mind. Impossible.
SPEAKER_03: So what would make you happy? What? What would make you happy? What makes you happy? My goal is to be number one. Number one? Yeah. When is it? Next year? You are young still. You have plenty of time. Plenty of time. Anyways, guys. It was very good. All in good spirit. Everything friendly. Everything good. I have...
SPEAKER_03: a big respect for both of you and both as a person and as an athlete and everything will be great and I can't wait to see you guys in Tbilisi and let the the better one stronger one win and then other one will just go home and train and come back never just one thing I know
SPEAKER_03: We don't give up, no matter what, for sure. That's what it is. Anything you want to say before we finish? You want to say anything to your fans? I want to be sure one thing about the lane, the fouls. What's that?
SPEAKER_02: Because I don't understand really sometimes. Sometimes the referee gives a foul to Michael, sometimes not. I don't understand. When you are down with the shoulder, it's a foul.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, that's clear. If Humeiros is parallel, it's not a foul. If it is down angle, it's a foul. If it is up angle... Exactly, but if this happening in one second is immediately foul... It is always foul. He gets fouls against Ongarbe, I remember. Yeah. It's correct. For everybody, it's not only for Michael...
SPEAKER_02: I mean, if you are mentioning this right now, it means that it's your concern. Are you worried that you're going to go into a King's move and get fouled? Is that what you're worried about? No. You're going to try the King's move. He's going to try the King's move. Real men fight on the table. If you are a real man, you will fight on the table with me. But I'm sure if you are a real man, you will fight on the table. This I'm sure. I'm confident with this. I like Army very much. If you are confident with this, why are you making the subject?
SPEAKER_03: If you are confident, then why are you starting the project? Because it's not beautiful to see too much. Yeah, but you are confident that Michael is not going to do so. Why are you started already? No, no, it's only to be clear. Okay. But don't do any discussion on the match. Today I saw the video and Yanis and Raimonds made it and like,
SPEAKER_03: I know what they are saying, but there is like, I don't understand how to measure that. Like they are saying that if shoulder is above and the arm is straight, I mean the elbow pad is five centimeter lower than the pin pad. So if the shoulder is above and the arm is straight, it should come to the pin pad. You understand? Because where you put your elbow,
SPEAKER_03: is elbow pad, and the pin pad is here. So if your elbow is on the pad, which is lower than pin pad, elbow pad is five centimeter, pin pad is 10 centimeter. And if your shoulder is not below, if it is parallel, your humerus, and if your arm is straight, then it should come to five centimeter below the pin pad. So if your arm humerus is like this, and if your arm
SPEAKER_03: is straight, there's a pin. The only way not to be pinned, it needs to be a little bit not straight like this. So what I'm just saying, we barely made people accept the rule. A lot of people says, oh, let it break, go under the table, which is bullshit. But what I'm just saying, the humerus bone,
SPEAKER_03: and we have a direct foul. You know, if the humerus bone is parallel, it's not foul. But one humerus bone, shoulder side goes a little bit down, it's direct stop, direct foul. So it is like impossible, the arm to be straight, shoulder to be above, and hand to be not to be pinned is impossible. If it is not pinned, it means that the hand is five-something or even six-something higher, because if it's five-something, it still comes bad.
SPEAKER_03: So what do you, do you understand, Ermes? No, normally at WAF, they say, come up, come up, come up. You go under, they say, come up, you come up again, you understand? Here, once you go, we stop and call foul. Yeah, you have the strictest rules.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, about this subject, yes, it is very, very strict. It's very strict. Yeah. Which is fine. I just adapt to the rules. You know what I mean? And Irma said, fighting on the table like a man. I will fight as hard as I possibly can and do everything I can within the rules to win.
SPEAKER_03: that's me that's if it's within the rules and I can make it happen and that's what it takes to win winning is the outcome you know what I mean I I will I will tell you guys like I will tell you guys Ermes if his humerus is not down angle don't complain it's a foul and Michael if your humerus is down angle referee gives you foul also don't complain
SPEAKER_00: If I don't think it's a foul, I'll ask for a review. You both have concerns? I don't have any concerns. Yeah, I have no concerns. We both understand the rules. He's just trying to bait me. That's all it is. It's all good. We're going to have a great match. I'm going to use my bone lock and he's going to use quality muscle. We're great. And my synthol arms. So, we're good. Okay, guys. Anyways, you said already
SPEAKER_03: your what you wanted to say and thank you very much michael and thank you very much hermes and see you guys in tbilisi and fans please support us is great like these are extraordinary human beings and they deserve all kind of uh super how big is my my my master my friend it's so big
SPEAKER_01: So big. Very big. I don't see it because it is divided. Yeah. Raise up. Look. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Look, my friend. It's so big. It takes up the whole screen. It's crazy. Look. Amazing, huh? What do you think, Ang? I'm neutral. What about that wrist? What about that wrist size?
SPEAKER_03: That's a big old wrist. We know about that wrist though. 27 centimeters. No, it's not 27. So big. Do you measure your bicep? Because when I measured your bicep, it didn't... No, no. I measured Michael's wrist. It was 10 inches. Like 25 centimeters, right? Correct, Michael? It's just 10 inches, 25 centimeters. And yours? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: 23 and a half, 24. Oh, that's big. Same as, same as Morozov. Yeah. More or less. Same. Yeah. I have the same. I, it's very difficult to grow up with Luis. When I am, I was younger, I had 21 and a half, something like that. Then I have 28.
SPEAKER_03: anyways guys thank you very very much i don't want to take your time it has been one hour and 36 minutes thank you for oh my god that's so long yeah a lot of time but it was good i liked it i enjoyed it and i wish you guys good preparation stay healthy and very positive yep take care guys take care bye guys
