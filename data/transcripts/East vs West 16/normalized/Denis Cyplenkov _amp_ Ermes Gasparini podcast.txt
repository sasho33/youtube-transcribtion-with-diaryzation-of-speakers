SPEAKER_02: Let's see how it will be. I think very tense event is waiting for us. And let's see who will be happy at the end of it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I'm sharing the link on social media and I will be with you guys.
SPEAKER_02: Some people are asking me why I shaved my head. It is because I do that normally probably twice a year. And I didn't do it lately in the last one year. I think it's because of the hair transplant. They said that it will show its full effect in one year.
SPEAKER_02: and so i don't think i shaved my hair in that last one years did i i don't remember but i think i didn't anyways a few more minutes and they will be joining us i don't
SPEAKER_02: guys you know when you ask the same question 335 million 878 654 times i put you on time up you know right um okay guys so
SPEAKER_02: Denis, how are you? Is it possible to use the phone sideways? Very good. Guys, I just need one minute. One minute and then I have to stop. I'm in the car still. Oh, you're in the car, yeah. Sorry for disturbing you, but thank you. A lot of people speak Russian, but your translation...
SPEAKER_02: But Ukrainian and Russian is very good. And your English is also very good. And you know armwrestling very well. So you also translate the true meaning of it as well. Thank you again. I'm trying. I'm not professional. Who cares? If we had a professional translator here, he couldn't translate. How is he going to know about armwrestling? Hello everyone.
SPEAKER_04: Are you struggling somewhere there? Yes, yes, I need literally two minutes, I'll stop now, otherwise I'm on the highway, I'll sit down from time to time and I'll stop a little. Come on, be careful. I was a little late, I was on the highway. Be careful, get off. How much time do you have there? Morning? 8 am.
SPEAKER_00: In short, I woke you all up. No, no, I've been at work for a long time. We start early in America. Well, thank God. Now they will tell me, damn, I found the time.
SPEAKER_02: This is the first time that you're forgetting that you're translating us. I know it's because of personal conversation. I'm sorry. He's saying that he's sorry that he wake me up. And I said, no, we're starting yearly in the United States. So it's hard to wake me up at 8 a.m. Yeah, yeah, yeah. With your time, it's 8 a.m. over there, right? 8 a.m., yes.
SPEAKER_04: So, before Ermes joins us, Denis, I told Ermes to join us, is that okay? Yes, he asked Ermes to join us as well. Is that okay? Yes, of course. If he shares the pasta, let him do it. Yes, Denis Senkis, absolutely, very good. He said that he will have to split some pasta with us.
SPEAKER_02: Aha, yeah, that's good, that's good, yeah. Yeah, I think Ermes and Denis, they like each other. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Now I'm ready. Okay, Denis, you, let's start. You tell us, how are you, my friend? Denis says, let's start. You tell us, how are you, how are you? The new year has passed, everything is good.
SPEAKER_00: At work, there were all sorts of New Year's stress. We coped with it, everything is simpler. As they say, you can train, get ready. And now it's the same. Just two days ago,
SPEAKER_04: Dennis is saying that, yeah, everything is fine. Thankfully, New Year's and all the celebration and all the work with New Year's is done. So now he's ready to start training. Also, he's scheduled his procedure.
SPEAKER_04: uh for a hair implantation yeah how is mine yeah yeah it looks very good yeah so he he will have that uh procedure on uh tuesday the fourth uh-huh okay okay is it possible or not to make your phone oh yeah i'm saying yeah
SPEAKER_02: Denis is saying, yeah, now you look bigger four times. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And Denis, I see you training. Before, like lately, you were training with only pronation. Now I see the video, you are more using a little bit more side and a little bit more wrist. Is that the case?
SPEAKER_04: He says, I've been watching you, you've started training. He says, earlier I saw that you only practiced in your videos. And now, he says, I've noticed that you've already started to use both your hand and your side hand in your training. Is that true? Or are these just videos? Well, these are not staged videos, of course. It's clear that...
SPEAKER_00: Now, due to the fact that I have planned this operation, I understand that I am not going to force the training, because I don't see any sense in it. I work in my average mode.
SPEAKER_00: At least I do exercises that I used to do. I decided to train according to the old way. Yes, I do my own exercises and, of course, we pull up the weak sides. Well, not even those that I had last time. I just do my own exercises that I considered necessary, I return them back into order. And, apparently, this gives such a result.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. Yeah, Dennis is saying that, yeah, kind of. He said, I'm not forcing anything right now because I planned this procedure, so it doesn't make sense to force anything right now. And he said that he returned to his previous training schedule.
SPEAKER_04: yeah and he implement all the old exercises that he did and that he liked and that worked for him and he said of course i'm accenting more on my weaknesses uh to you know manipulate everything and bring everything up to point but uh yeah that that's that that's he believes that that's what works the best for him yeah i agree i agree yeah right now right now if he if he
SPEAKER_02: gets the old type of strain, I mean, like to movement. And because recently he built so much pronation, I think together it will make him even more dangerous. Maybe not as dangerous as crime, because that's about the health. But technically, I think he will be more effective.
SPEAKER_04: Engin says, and he's right, I agree, he says, I think that if you still turn on and work on your sidearm, he says, because you built so well and strengthened your pronation, he says, that you will be very dangerous. He says, well, maybe you won't get to the point where you were in the best peak form, because, well, time has passed, health, and all that. He says, well, I think it's...
SPEAKER_00: on another level, you see such a complex approach? I hope so, because there were moments when I switched to other exercises and I didn't have enough strength for my own exercises. And at some point I decided
SPEAKER_00: I think that my age is not the same, so I will change something. I will do what I did. And so I returned my movements and I will strengthen them, try to return them to the forms that were before. Well, at least in terms of weight, yes, in terms of work. I'll come back, though.
SPEAKER_04: yeah then he's saying yeah he said uh i was trying to uh do a different exercises and different training programs uh and right now when i'm coming back i decided that you know in my age uh i know already what works the best that's why i returned to my previous program and i'm trying to return to my previous shape and try to bring my working weights to what it was
SPEAKER_00: — And the question is, how is his health right now? — The question is, Denis, how is his overall health? — Well, I feel good. I mean, after the last year, after the trip on vacation, my problems, at least at the moment, have disappeared and have not surfaced in the state that I had.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I do massages on the hip joint, and these painful sensations have disappeared. Yes, there are moments where you just have to stretch. It was delayed, so to speak, I was straining, but at least there are no painful sensations. Well, I've been planning my hair for a long time, but there were moments with tests.
SPEAKER_00: I had to go there several times. As a result, there were holidays and no holidays. And only now, we have already agreed on the 4th, we will do it. There will be a little rest, let's say, not to train for a couple of weeks. And then there is a desire to prepare, to fight.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Dennis is saying, listen, everything is good. I feel good. After he did his rest and his vacation trip, he said, all my previous problems are gone as of right now. I don't feel any problems. He said the update on the hip is that he's doing massages regularly.
SPEAKER_04: He said I'm limping a little bit, but there is no pain. So I'm good on that point and also he said that because of the holidays and stuff he scheduled this hair implantation for February for few weeks He will have to take a break and then he said I will start preparation and I would love to get myself ready and You know arm wrestle someone Yeah
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Okay. And the question is that, does he think that hip problem will be gone or when he starts doing general exercise and everything, it's possible that it will come back? I know that it's not totally gone, but
SPEAKER_04: He feels better, as you said, right? Yes, yes. Does he think that it is because of inactivity? Denis, do you think your hip joint will not interfere with your training when you start lifting weights, working? Do you think you've been treated enough to be able to lift? No, the thing is that I used to do such exercises while standing on my feet.
SPEAKER_00: Now I just carried it all to the table. And I removed the load from this leg. And it doesn't bother me. At least I understand that now, just working at the table, you can remove the load from this place. And at least I feel good. And again, I remind you that when I was then,
SPEAKER_00: when I walked, I had a sharp pain. It worried me. And in connection with the fact that I am constantly being massaged now, that is, as they say, probably all this works, and this pain, in principle, has passed. That is, even when I walked before, when I walked, it was. Now it's gone.
SPEAKER_00: And of course, I will not direct the load on her on purpose. That is, all this can be eliminated by working at the table. Okay. Yeah, Denis is saying that... Ermes is flexing. Denis is saying... Massive! Massive, massive. Hold on, Ermes.
SPEAKER_04: Hello, Ermes. Dennis is saying that, listen, I make adjustments.
SPEAKER_04: in my exercises whatever i did uh standing on my legs and uh you know loading my hip i eliminate from my uh program and he said listen it's uh uh always can any exercise can be replaced with a similar one but uh let's say on a table and most and majority of my exercises and work i just replace with a work on the table and they will do approximately the same job
SPEAKER_04: and he said also that before when he was even walking it was very sharp pain at each step in his hip right now he's walking there is no pain he's just a little bit limping and he said i'm not loading my hip anymore
SPEAKER_04: So I don't stand and I don't do any exercises which load my hip. I just replace them with exercises similar but not to load my hip and there is no problems as of right now. Okay, yeah. So I have the same problems because of my neck. I don't want to do so much heavy exercise when I'm standing.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but anything that's coming from cable is still put pressure, but not as much as the other one. So how are you, Ermes? Good? Yes, yes. I finished the training. What did you train today? Chest and shoulder. Everything is important. Yeah, everything is important. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Denis, when do you think that we will see you again at the East vs. West? And which level of match do you think that you would be looking for? Denis, when do you think that we will see you again at the East vs. West? And what level of match would you like to see?
SPEAKER_00: I wanted to ask Engin when will East vs. West be in Turkey? We don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Does it need to be in Istanbul for him to compete? That's what he asked. Okay. I think we lost him, huh? Yeah, yeah, I think he will be back, yeah. Ermes, what are you drinking there? Drugs.
SPEAKER_02: good for the power my friend look at this yeah yeah that's that's the only way i know i i i can measure already i have a system technology even from there video i can check can you do like this i will measure again 60 60 now oh for this six and a half okay
SPEAKER_01: Denis, Engin is asking... I will never meet you again, Engin. Never, right? You make me depressed. No, no. Never again. Engin is asking, is it important for you to do it in Turkey? Is it comfortable for you to come and compete?
SPEAKER_00: But what if it is in Azerbaijan? Or Georgia? Or Kazakhstan? Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan. The fact that, let's say, without visa, probably, because you understand, I have no problems. As for the nearest countries, where we don't have a visa, and where, let's say,
SPEAKER_04: There is an opportunity to get there without any problems. In Georgia, it would also be possible, but not now. I just need to know where and when they will be. Denis is saying it's not mandatory to be in Istanbul, but it needs to be some countries where he can easily get a flight and visit us.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, GB19 is asking, is Denis' shape better than his last match? And I don't think so, because he's not even really training, but just you can ask him, yeah. Denis, someone is asking in the chat, is your form the same as in your last match, or worse, better? I can't say right now. I have nothing to say.
SPEAKER_00: I don't force it now, because I know that there will be an operation, and I was going to start immediately after the operation, after the recovery period.
SPEAKER_00: I don't even cut my weight now. I can fight with someone. I can't refuse, I can't stand before temptation. I don't work with heavy weights now. I can't say where I am now.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. Denis is saying that it's impossible to answer that question properly right now because he said, I feel good, but I'm not training. I'm not preparing to anything. I'm just keeping, maintaining some, you know, training. And he also said, yeah, I am arm wrestling sometimes on the table, but it's only because I cannot say no to myself because I love this so much. But I cannot answer about my shape. When I will start my preparation, we will see and we will know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I agree, yeah. This was a super chat, that's why I had to ask him. Yeah, I translated for him. Okay, there is another question. I'm going to be back to you, sorry, because I'm missing this and forgetting.
SPEAKER_02: Is Ermes and Denis' left arm match possible in the future? I don't think I would set that match. Ermes, after Malin Canmaz said that he wants to focus on right arm, and Denis says that his left arm is problematic as far as I know, but we can ask that question. Are you going to pull Denis' left arm? Yes, we can make a handicap category and we can pull with left.
SPEAKER_01: Handicap category. David Alisson hurt you that badly? No, I feel pain every time the elbow, I don't know what happened. Left arm, yeah. Really, I checked with the RMA, everything.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I feel dislocated. Can you ask Denis how his left arm is doing? Yeah, I will translate everything to him and ask him. Denis, someone in the chat asked, is it possible for you to make a super match between Ermes and Denis on your left arm? We first asked Ermes. Ermes said, listen, Denis and I now need a special category on our left arm for the disabled.
SPEAKER_04: He says, after I fought Alizhan, my joint is twisted, it hurts all the time. He says, I'm left-handed. My left hand hurts too. I can't... If someone pulls me up, I can't...
SPEAKER_00: They shoot themselves. It even hurts to strain. They resist. Well, that's why he joked, he says, I will make a special category for the disabled. No, well, I always say, if he is sick and I am sick, then everything is fair. Then everything is fair.
SPEAKER_04: yeah then he's saying that uh yeah he have problems with his left also if somebody trying to uh tap roll him over the top uh it's just giving up it's very sharp pain but he said if air masses are the same is in a lot of pain then it's very fair let's do it he said we we're gonna go until the end
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah okay i think that we we we missed that part of the question uh in the last one remember we said that like i i said uh when does he think that he can pull again and it needs to be somewhere so the part about when and the part about the which level
SPEAKER_04: He would like to start. I think those parts we missed, if I'm not mistaken. Yes, I will re-ask him. Denis, he asks again, asked me specifically to ask. He says, I understand that it should be somewhere in the countries where you can fly comfortably, and there should be a visa, and so on. But he says, when approximately, according to the dates, can you count on it, and at what level do you think this match should take place?
SPEAKER_00: Well, now at the end of February, after Georgia, they will perform. I will already understand more or less that I am ready to train. And maybe, I don't know, the end of May, the beginning of June, something like that. Or something in the summer. Well, in the next month, three or four months.
SPEAKER_00: It was possible to fight with someone. And with whom? Naturally, it's not the top 5, that's for sure. After the top 5, you can select some athletes and think about choosing someone together. That's how I see it.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, thanks, I'll translate. Engin, yeah, Denis has said, wow, that's a very, very sharp answer, that he will know for sure by the end of the February, but approximately, he said, end of May,
SPEAKER_04: And beginning of June, that's where he probably will be ready for a match. He said like three to four months approximately from the end of February when he's planning to start training. And he said...
SPEAKER_04: please do not uh be in top five that's not that's not where he want to be but after top five he said that you know it's it's it's up to you to pick and choose the end no no it's not up to me i i will talk with him i will see his level but the thing is that i think we will have one event in the middle of the may and possibly istanbul but we don't know yet
SPEAKER_02: And then after that, the June event is in US.
SPEAKER_02: So, it's possible. This is how it is planned, but it's not concrete, you know. So, yeah. But does he think that, like, middle of the May is okay? But middle of the May is going to give him only two and a half months. Not three, three and a half months, yeah. Let me ask him. Denis, look, their approximate plans are as follows. In the middle of May, ES vs. ES will be in Istanbul. But these are plans, it's not confirmed yet, these are plans.
SPEAKER_00: And in June, he'll be in the US, somewhere in the US. He says, I don't know if you'll be ready by the middle of May, or is it possible? Well, by the end of May, if you take it from February, March, April, three months, well, theoretically, you can. I just say, you have to think about your opponent. I just have to understand that I'm ready for training.
SPEAKER_00: The rehabilitation period after the operation on the hair, I don't know what it should be, so that everything will heal there. And then they said, if I strain, the bowels will melt.
SPEAKER_00: I shouldn't have done the surgery. Theoretically, if it happens at the end of May, in Tambul, it's good. And after Georgia, we'll call him and think of some opponents. Well, at least he can offer 3-4-5. That's what he said, that we'll call and think. Yes, there was a choice. Roughly speaking, after Georgia, on the 20th,
SPEAKER_00: If I have three months at the end of May, it would be great. I would probably sign up for it here.
SPEAKER_04: okay uh engine uh dennis is saying that uh let's talk right after the georgian event he will know for sure but he got a little excited from what i see this is not my job to translate this but i i saw this intonation i cannot translate intonation you know but he said he would probably sign up for something like this meet to end of the may in istanbul
SPEAKER_04: It will give him just under three months. He said, you know what, let's talk right after the Georgia event and let's discuss some possible athletes, some possible opponents. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he told me, he told me that like he had a video, hey, like organizer, you know, organizers, you know, I'm ready or something. He made a video. And whenever he says organizer, there was an East versus West logo. And, you know, yeah. So he, I asked him, you know, Dennis, like always ready, you know, we are just like, anytime you want to ask him, there are some people, you know, like they have that kind of credit.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, absolutely. John Bersing says, I want to pull this guy. I mean, unless the guy doesn't want to pull or something, you know, and I will do my best.
SPEAKER_02: If John wants, for sure, I want this guy, I will do my best. It doesn't really so much matter for me, you know, if it is okay or not. Of course, John's credit is bigger than anyone else's, but Dennis is also one of those guys with the legendary status. Do you agree, Ermes? Of course.
SPEAKER_04: Denis says, well, let's talk, thanks. He says, listen, you always have such a huge open loan with us, because you have such a legendary status. John, he's probably in first place with us. If he says that I want to fight it, he says, I will always do everything possible to make it happen. And you have the same similar loan.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you, thank you. We will talk about it. That's good, that's good. I see that Denis feels a little bit healthier and then
SPEAKER_02: No matter how much you love, if you can't, you can't. You don't want to really go there and make yourself look not good, you understand?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but whenever he feels a little bit, you know, healthy, I feel like his passion is, like, not holding, like, he cannot stop himself anymore. He's ready to come back, yeah. That's what I think. Engin says, he says,
SPEAKER_00: In sports, there was never such a thing that I avoided something or hid from something. If I was preparing, I would perform.
SPEAKER_00: It was an incomprehensible situation, it had never happened before. And, of course, there was even a slight outburst, you know, not to harm myself even worse, but it really happened. Well, such a state, I think, was very similar to the coronavirus, because I got tired quickly, lifted something heavy, got tired, and that's it, my legs were cramping. And, roughly speaking,
SPEAKER_00: I went on vacation in November. After that, thank God, it all ended. And I still feel great. I hope that this will not happen again. It is inconvenient for me myself, that I am there, I agree, and so I was shaken. Therefore, I hope that this will not happen again, and everything will be clear now.
SPEAKER_04: yeah uh dennis is saying yeah he said listen it's i i never hide from anything and i've been always trying to get ready for my super matches the best i can but this situation with my sickness before he said i feel very sorry because i've been making some
SPEAKER_04: you know deals and statements and then i got sick and after my vacation or recovery now i feel amazing and he said i'm very happy i hope i'm not gonna get sick anytime soon and i'm i'm ready yeah for for us his health is we want to see him at the table competitive
SPEAKER_02: but as Engin Terzi like I would love to see him at the table at that level but if it is going to make him unhealthy I don't want that you know I wouldn't want it yeah anyway so I hope he's okay there is a super chat Dino says Ermes look like 110 kg guy no less less
SPEAKER_02: 107. Okay. And what's your real weight? I think I asked you the other day. 126. 126. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Ermes says, no, where is the 110? 107. He just didn't eat the macaroni. He didn't eat the crema. And so, honestly, it weighs 126. Now you can see. You see, everything went into his hands. Dennis is saying, Ermes, you have to eat pasta more often. And then when you show... What did they say?
SPEAKER_02: And then when you show your forearm, he said, oh, now I can see everything in the arm. I think people think that he doesn't look heavy because I think he looks healthier compared to before. I think he's doing a lot of cardio in the past. You would see it looks like he had a blood pressure, red and bloated. Now his face looks very healthy. But yes, I think this is not your heaviest. I think your heaviest was 130.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, but when I fought with Levan or Jerry, it was my biggest version. I was in the morning 29, 30. Okay, only two kilos. Two kilos of water, what is it? Nothing. Yeah, yeah. And at that time you were not doing as much cardio, right? Yeah, yeah. I never did cardio like now. Already six, seven months I started to do cardio.
SPEAKER_01: The weight in the gym is more than when I was with Lewandowski. We need to see if the weight in the gym is the same on the table, but I think yes, because I didn't rest for two or three years.
SPEAKER_01: You care more about the weights in the gym than the one on the scale? Yeah, I want to be a super performer in the training.
SPEAKER_04: He says he has never done as much cardio as he does now. He says he feels very good. He says when he fought with Levan and Jerry, he weighed about 130 kg in the morning. He says he didn't feel good, he was so full, you know, he kept a lot of water. He says he's 126 kg now, but he has a completely different weight, he feels good. He says he doesn't care how much he weighs.
SPEAKER_01: I don't care how much weight I have in the gym, how much work I have. I like how I feel now. Another big thing I noticed. In the past, when I was training biceps, the first exercises were the same weight or a little bit less. And after two, three exercises, my endurance went very down.
SPEAKER_01: And now the weights after two, three exercise a lot more because I have a lot more endurance and more cardio. And this is a very big factor on the competition.
SPEAKER_04: He said earlier, he said earlier, he said, my working weights, he said, the first two or three approaches, he said, good working weight and that's it, he said, then the fourth approach could not even finish, he said, everything fell down immediately. And he says, now, on the contrary, he says, two or three approaches, he says, and I have a lot of energy, he says, I'm even adding. He says, he gained a lot of endurance, he says, and I think it will help me a lot behind the table. He will need it now, yes.
SPEAKER_02: Dennis commented, he's like, yeah, yeah, you will need it very much with Michael. Yes. Yeah, we will go there very soon. Armutant is asking, Brian Shaw versus Dennis. And I just think that Brian Shaw needs a bit more time because he's just new. Does Dennis agree with me?
SPEAKER_04: Someone in the chat asked if Brian, Shoei and Denis could make a super match. Engin said no, it's too early for Brian. He needs more experience to be able to fight at this level. What do you think, Denis? I think he needs experience. When he fought Eddie Hall, it was clear that
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's not that it's too raw, it's clear that he's just started. But he needs a year, probably. So, it's more tense. Well, you have to understand what to do with the table in general. Because he can see that he's still giving hints, and he doesn't understand, doesn't understand. But it's okay, because the guys are passing through me, the new ones. And you can see that
SPEAKER_00: There is no understanding, there is no sense of the hand either. And it takes time. I am sure that he has a lot of strength and he has such a serious weight, that is, he can apply a bad force and compete with many, but for an experience of a year or two, he definitely needs to work out.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's not that you have to work hard, you just have to get into it and analyze what you are doing in general. And those who are interested, they can do it in the end. Those who are not interested, they don't even develop in this direction. I hope that he fell in love with this kind of sport and will only progress here.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. Yeah, Dennis is absolutely agree. He said yeah, he need at least at very least one year of experience and he need to work hard and analyze what he's doing. And he said one or two years, he may
SPEAKER_04: make some waves on there you know he said yeah he's very strong uh as of right now and his body weight is huge so he can uh use his just raw power and even win with some athletes right now because of that raw power but to be on a certain level he needs a little more experience and he said i hope he fell in love with this sport with arm wrestling and if that's the case he will he will go up and he will be very good soon yeah yeah i agree i agree it looks like he loves it yeah
SPEAKER_02: dino dino is asking two questions or one of them is question neither of them question he says ermis the the chat is very sad like the chats here they are very sad and the other one he says he says he says small by steps but enough for monsters he says that your bicep is small
SPEAKER_02: yeah are you serious or what no not me not me the guy oh yeah he looks big yeah yeah yeah now now because when the light is coming from back it doesn't look big but now when the light is coming from front yeah yeah yeah we understand it is okay maybe not 46 but before the age now better huh yeah yeah everybody's happy when when the light comes from back
SPEAKER_02: It didn't look so big. I'm surprised. Yeah, yeah, he looks big. Yeah, he looks big. Yeah. Yeah. And let's see if there is no super chat. I think you know, without the oil is into bigger quality Moscow. Yeah, yeah. Different. No water or oil. Only Moscow quality. Only muscle. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Dennis, do you have like, do you think at least you say, yes, you cannot know this already. The two questions, do you think that you will ever be at the like world title match again? And the second, do you have such a goal?
SPEAKER_04: I have two questions for you, Denis. The first question is, do you think you'll ever fight for the world title again? That's the first question. And the second question is, do you have such a goal? Honestly, of course. You watch everyone, you watch how the guys grow, how strong they are, you know?
SPEAKER_00: how much time you need for it, how much you need to plow, how much health you need for it. And, of course, somewhere deep inside I want to, but at the moment I'm being careful. I understand that somewhere it has already broken through, somewhere something has already strained my health.
SPEAKER_00: And you, of course, are careful here. You start to worry about something, not to work on something in order not to provoke something. Of course, this is something that holds you back. But there is a desire, of course. You understand that if you once won and were a champion,
SPEAKER_00: such a desire will not go away. Somewhere, sooner or later, you want to feel it again. Therefore, of course, there is a desire. But I understand that when you are young and nothing really worries you and does not bother you, you, as they say, go and do not turn around, and back, even to the side, do not turn around. Everything is in your favor and, as it were,
SPEAKER_00: Only forward, and the victory is not beyond the mountains. And now there is such a moment, of course, connected. That is, somewhere you slow yourself down, somewhere you start to worry. So, it is necessary here, somewhere, something, maybe, should not be raised, because now I will provoke something else. So, enough for today, I'll try next time.
SPEAKER_00: This is how it all happens. And so, of course, if, let's say, health will allow health, that is, I understand what I can raise, how I can raise, what to strive for, that is, the program is in my head, then yes, why not? I'm just thinking about it.
SPEAKER_04: uh dennis says uh that uh he said i am following for all the guys and all the arm wrestling very closely and uh i am watching them and i am very happy every time when they
SPEAKER_04: making the next step. And I also understand how much work and how much desire this takes. And he said, yes, I want it somewhere deep in me. I always want it. And with time, he said, I became more careful. When I'm lifting my stuff and I'm training, there is something that is stopping me and preventing me because it's not the fear, but it's understanding that I may provocate some injuries.
SPEAKER_04: and provocate some health issues that's why i'm very slow right now but he said in reality i'm only thinking about this because if you ever experienced to be a champion and to win you will always want it again and he said possible he will he will run after and he said as long as i feel healthy and it's it's possible and he said i will go ahead and i want to do it again that's good that's what i wanted to hear yeah
SPEAKER_04: He says, that's what I understand, that's what I want to hear. If it's possible, then he'll do it. He says, look at Ermes, he's not happy after you said you wanted to come back, he's not happy at all. I even took his pasta.
SPEAKER_04: He said that he will take your pasta even one day. You're already too difficult, my friend. Listen, listen. He said you're eating yourself and you're not sharing. One day I will come and will take it from you. You're already too difficult, my friend. Stay away, please. Okay, how about we do this? How about we do this? I invite both of you to my home.
SPEAKER_02: Istanbul and we eat all together pasta. I cover the expenses and everything and you guys also do some training. Yeah, for me it would be amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Edgen, don't forget you need a translator. Oh yeah, for sure, Paolo.
SPEAKER_04: And Engin says, let's do it this way. Listen, how rude I am, you know. You always help me and look at the front of you what I am doing. I always think that America is just far away, you know, to come. It's right around the corner now. Engin says, let's do it this way. He says, I'll invite you both home. He says, the food is all on me. You, he says, will train and everything will be great. I say, don't forget, please, that you need a translator.
SPEAKER_02: Denis is saying that yes we need a translator that's definitely but we can eat in in peace and quiet yeah yeah yeah we can do that as well yeah and at the table everyone knows that language huh yeah that's true yeah okay dino is saying devon hyping
SPEAKER_01: Michael Todd, but Ermes is going to break him. Do you agree with that, Ermes? Yeah. You show last video with Todd Pipe. People can't hold with all his body. They push, they jump. When they push with Todd Pipe, they jump. He made a pipe and he's calling it Todd Pipe. Todd Pipe.
SPEAKER_02: okay yeah anyways there is a super chat texas piranha thanks for all you do engine super excited for the event happening in texas do you know when tickets will be available for it paulo good senior
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he says, Paolo, yeah, my friend, I think it has to be, the tickets should be there either right before the East-West 16 or right after. We can't really wait that long, but just, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so maybe we talk about the upcoming events. Denis, which match are you looking forward to the most in that card? There will be a lot of interesting fights.
SPEAKER_00: It's always nice to watch the guys with whom you've already crossed paths, with whom you constantly communicate, make friends. And there will be a lot of interesting couples for me. Ermes and Michael will be interesting. And Morozov, Laletin will be interesting. Well, Lara.
SPEAKER_04: then he's saying that uh engine i'm sorry but i cannot answer you with a single answer because uh you know i'm following your friends with most of the people on the card and he said
SPEAKER_04: A lot of matches are interesting. He started to name Gasparini and Michael, and he said Devon and Kukrinja, mentioned Morozov and Laletin, and he said more than half of the matches are very interesting to me, and I cannot tell you which one is the most interesting. Denis, Morozov right now
SPEAKER_02: He's about 140 kilos and he's still getting bigger. Morozov doesn't talk as much as he did last time when they put right arm. This time he doesn't talk so much, but he's getting bigger and bigger. A lot of people think that like Vladekin is clear favorite while Morozov is the champion and he hasn't lost any super match yet. How do you see?
SPEAKER_02: the chances in this much.
SPEAKER_04: Denis, look, Morozov is gaining weight, very seriously. He doesn't talk much on social media, he's silent. He says he weighs 140 kilograms and continues to grow. The majority of the public thinks that Laletin is such a favorite in this match, although Morozov is now an active champion and has not lost for a very long time. How do you see this match, how will it happen?
SPEAKER_00: What do you think? Well, I will say about Artem. Yes, he is more in the shadows. He doesn't show anything. I understand that he is getting ready. And it's hard to say anything about his shape. And Vitalii was here for a very long time, on the project. And I understand that he
SPEAKER_00: I don't think I've ever played like that before. And you can see that he wants to win too. He's very strong. Well, at least I've seen it live. I've seen it live. I've seen it live. I've seen it live. I've seen it live. I've seen it live. I've seen it live. I've seen it live. I've seen it live.
SPEAKER_00: Either Vitalii will win quickly, or he will be in a hurry. He will be in a hurry, and then Artem will have a chance, due to his endurance, he will be able to pull out this fight with more endurance. That is, Vitalii will try to attack quickly, to win in his style. But if he is in a hurry, then of course he will lose. That's how I see it.
SPEAKER_00: Two moments. One has speed and the other has endurance. That's how I see this fight. I even think that Vitalii will take the first round, the second, for example. But then, maybe, he can shoot and then everything will go in a different direction. I can predict.
SPEAKER_00: But I think Vitalii has been doing well lately. He's been performing well. He's been winning fast. There's something about that. At least I'm saying that. I haven't seen Artyom. But it's clear that he's making progress in the scene. He's doing well. And if I had seen at least something, I could have said something.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, that's right. Artyom is somewhere in the shade and he's not showing much but he said I understand he's training very hard and he's getting ready and he's working with his mindset and everything is good there, we just don't see it.
SPEAKER_04: He also said that he saw Vitalii for a long time. He was there, I understand, in Moscow for some project. And he said, this is a machine. I never saw him participate in that size and that strong. And he said that it's going to be a very interesting match. But how he sees it, most likely it's going to go either Vitalii is winning fast,
SPEAKER_04: But if Artyom will stop it and it's going to be a fight, then Artyom will turn it around. He also said that his vision and most likely how he thinks it's going, that first round Vitalii will take on the speed and power.
SPEAKER_04: and then uh maybe a second round also but then it's very possible that artyom will take over in the third round he will stop and that it will turn around but he said i still think that vitaly probably is one percent better chance than artyom
SPEAKER_02: So 50.5, 49.5. So he's saying that there is a possibility Vitalii to dominate, but there is a possibility during the second or third round, Morozov stops. And he said that once Morozov stops, probably he will be taking the rest of the rounds. Yeah. Exactly. Yes. I understand. And another question for Dennis. Sorry, Ermes, making you wait. Dennis, if you pull someone outside of top five,
SPEAKER_02: And if you win, just say middle of the May, do you think that end of the summer you would pull against the gentleman that is just right by you on the screen?
SPEAKER_04: Okay, Denis, here's the question. Let's say we make a great match for you at the end of May. Not in the first five, but a little bit further. And, for example, you win against him. What do you think, maybe at the end of the summer we'll make a match with the man who's sitting next to you right now?
SPEAKER_00: No, it won't be at the end of the year. If I will fight anyway, it will be once every six months. If something happens, it will be, let's say, in December. At the end of the new year. Because I have a lot of movements there in the summer, all sorts of events that I, in fact, signed up for. And it will interfere with me. In any case, I will not go to the National Assembly now.
SPEAKER_00: I was behind the train, as we call it. And I had to perform and rest for a month or two. I didn't want to be in the same race as before. I didn't want to be in the same race as before. I didn't want to be in the same race as before. I didn't want to be in the same race as before. I didn't want to be in the same race as before. I didn't want to be in the same race as before. I didn't want to be in the same race as before. I didn't want to be in the same race as before. I didn't want to be in the same race as before. I didn't want to be in the same race as before. I didn't want to be in the same race as before.
SPEAKER_00: I have already gathered several athletes one after another. It turns out that I am a person who has promised, I must fulfill my promise. And it turns out that I drove myself here, I took a dead end, so I don't want to promise. The fight is going on, and after it passes, we are already guessing something further. And here it turns out that due to the fact that
SPEAKER_00: I didn't give myself the opportunity to rest. I couldn't do it in my head, because I had a task, and I understood that if I would rest now, I would do it again.
SPEAKER_00: I had to start all over again. In short, I drove myself into this corner, in fact. I don't want to repeat this mistake anymore, because there is a possibility that at the end of the day, there was some kind of failure. And this is what started before the evaporation. This is all in total.
SPEAKER_00: I had to run with everyone and immediately lead to this situation and to this state. In terms of quality? Yes, in terms of quality, I definitely have to have a fight. I remember everything. But if I suddenly, as Engin says, win, then yes, you can make plans.
SPEAKER_04: Denis is saying that first of all it's not possible by end of the summer because he wants to pull every half a year because he decided that he need at least one or two months rest after the match and then he can start preparation for next one
SPEAKER_04: because he explained why he said listen I want to keep my promises I don't want to promise anything that I cannot deliver last time and last time he believes that last time he promised and he feel bad about it he promised and he couldn't deliver because he was trying you know to force himself faster more and that's may provocate his health issues he said I'm sorry but I don't want it anymore I want to deliver my promises and he said yes I remember that I own
SPEAKER_04: to Ermes a match and I will deliver it. If I will win this match in May, we can set it up, but please, every half a year I need a little more time. Maybe December or something like that. And I was trying to joke and I said, quality, my friend, right? Yeah, I mean, just tell him that we are not upset with him because he couldn't pull against Ermes because, I mean, if he's not healthy,
SPEAKER_02: I mean, he's not healthy. Nobody is going to really want him to come there unprepared. And it would be even a disrespect to the people who want to see that match. So he made the right decision if he's not healthy. I'm sure Ermes is not upset. So tell him not to feel that way. We know that he wants to pull it. If he cannot pull it, we know that it is because there is a serious reason for it.
SPEAKER_04: Denis says, don't worry, no one's offended you, everything's fine, we know everything. No one wants you to struggle with health problems, no one cares. Ermes says, no, everything's fine, don't worry. Come on, get ready, come in healthy, we'll always be happy to see you. Ermes is a good boy, last time he behaved like a man. Thank you very much for that.
SPEAKER_00: I say it again, maybe 10 years ago, maybe I was enough to be in both for a year, you know. After all these situations that are happening, I say, you start to be a little afraid, and you realize that you still need to build this algorithm a little differently now, and you still need to be prepared, speak up, rest.
SPEAKER_00: He said, Ermes, thank you very much. You're super and you're a real man.
SPEAKER_04: He likes you and thank you very much. And he also said, yeah, listen, 10 years ago, I may do it a year straight without any interruptions, but time is time and now I need to get ready.
SPEAKER_02: pull participate two months break get ready participate and in this regime i may be back and i may still deliver some some good pulling that's most important for us yeah yeah but hermes if hermes wins against michael end of the year he has a match against uh levan so if hermes wins
SPEAKER_02: Against Michael, they cannot pull. He will be pulling Levan. But if Michael wins, then Ermes can pull rest of the year as he likes. So by this information, Ermes, end of the year, you will be pulling Denis? Levan. Oh, you will not be pulling Denis. OK.
SPEAKER_04: Engin jokes around a bit. He says that if Ermes fights Michael and wins, he won't be able to fight you at the end of the year, because he'll fight Levan. But if he loses, he'll fight whoever he wants. Ermes says, will you fight Denis? No, I'll fight Levan. That's right, it's a champion attitude.
SPEAKER_00: I understand Ermes. Of course, we need to win and fight with Levan. Everyone can still fight. Of course, you need to fight with the strongest guys. This is a championship. We all strive for this. If I fight with someone else, it's okay.
SPEAKER_04: Dennis is saying, yeah, yeah, that's absolutely right. Ermes needs to win and Ermes needs to go ahead and Ermes needs to pull Levan. And while everybody can arm wrestle, you need to set your goals maximum as possible. And he said, don't worry, Ermes, I will find somebody else to pull this time. We'll pull later. Go ahead. Okay, now this starts another conversation.
SPEAKER_02: He says yes. No, hold on. I'm very sorry, but I have like five minutes, okay? Okay, okay. Let's finish, yeah. Denis, you say that, okay, Ermes, go pull Lewand and this. You know, this to happen, Ermes needs to beat Michael. Is that your prediction or what is it?
SPEAKER_00: He says, you know, in order for Ermes to fight with Levan, he has to beat Michael. Is this your official prediction of this match, or what is it? Well... I'm watching Michael. He's strengthening his angles. He's not trying to fight... He won't fight like...
SPEAKER_00: Ermes wants to. He forces himself. And you can see that the weights are not bad. But it will be difficult for Ermes. He does it right. He trains endurance. I understand that he is now... Michael, in his own style, fought well with Genadi, with Kvikvinia. I understand that...
SPEAKER_00: Ermes will be able to stand up. And here you need to understand if he can, as they say, finish him off with a triceps. It probably won't work out otherwise. Will he have enough strength for this? But in any case, Michael will take the strength and energy from Ermes. I feel it. And here, of course, I'm just...
SPEAKER_00: 50-50. You know, Michael's wrestling technique is unpredictable in terms of the fact that you need to be able to fight against it. You need to develop a strategy. I hope Ermes did it all and he will succeed. But there will be an interesting fight and there will not be everything in one cage, one hundred percent.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, Dennis is saying, well, if you're going to predictions, he said, I'm following Michael too, and I'm watching him, how he's training. And he said that he, Michael, doing very good things. He's getting stronger in his angles. And he said, I've been watching how he finished with Genadi. And he said that, Ermes, it's not going to be an easy one. And you're doing the right thing that you're training, your endurance, absolutely.
SPEAKER_04: and he said i cannot predict uh that somebody of those guys gonna win because it's very unpredictable match michael is very unpredictable and uh it's 50 50 in his opinion and he said aramis i hope that you did your strategy and you're ready because michael's styles are unpredictable he can go different angles and uh you have to be ready
SPEAKER_04: to finish him in triceps most likely and you have to be you have to have your strategy ready for this match he said anyhow michael will take a lots of energy from you and it's not going to be an easy one what is your answer if you have any i'm ready i have this strategy taking my technique to beat him
SPEAKER_01: I don't think he has a lot of chance to win, really. Because if I compare about the wrist, it's impossible he takes my wrist. It's only about endurance to finish the match as quickly as possible. Because with a bone lock, he can stay down under the table for two hours.
SPEAKER_01: You know, this is the problem.
SPEAKER_04: Ermes says, I'm ready, the strategy is ready, I've worked everything out. To be honest, I don't see Michael winning. I think I'm winning, I've prepared well. He says, yes, of course, I'll try to finish the match as quickly as possible, because it's on such a bone lock, that is, if Michael gets stuck on his bones, he says, of course, he can climb under the table and sit there for two hours.
SPEAKER_00: I will try to finish the match quickly. Well, God willing, just like in any case, in Ermes, the fight is more beautiful and more interesting, and we will root for him, but I think that this is my opinion, that he will still get up, it will be difficult for him, and then, as they say,
SPEAKER_00: If he is ready, if he has come up with a strategy, everything should work out in this case.
SPEAKER_04: Dennis is saying that it's definitely that your arm wrestling is more beautiful and more interesting. And he said that if you're ready, that everything is going to happen. And he's cheering for you. But he also said that it's my opinion. He said, I believe that at some point you will be stopped and you will stuck there. But if you're ready, everything will be there.
SPEAKER_02: The last question, Paolo, and we're finishing. Tommaso Superchats, Tommaso Tarlao. Question for Denis. If you could get back to your prime shape right now, who would be the person you would like to pull first? If he's in the best shape ever right now, as today, who would he want to pull?
SPEAKER_04: Here's a question from the chat. Denis, if you could get into the best form you've ever been in, who would you choose as your first opponent? I'd like to fight LeBan, of course. If I could get into the best form possible, I'd be a fool to choose someone else.
SPEAKER_04: Denis is saying, if I would be in my best shape, I would be full if I would take anybody else but Levan. Yeah, I agree. And two kings would be one.
SPEAKER_02: Anyways, thank you very much, Paolo. Can you explain to him that you didn't have time and we have to finish? So he wouldn't be upset with us. Yes, yes. And Ermes, thank you very much, my friend, for joining. Thank you, guys. Thank you, my friends. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Denis, it's me running to work. It's not them interrupting you, it's me. Because I have to go to work, I asked him. It's okay. Good luck.
SPEAKER_02: And all the best. And Dennis, should I pull as well? See, should I start? He says, what do you think, can I start fighting again? You see, it's already...
SPEAKER_00: In any case, you will have to. It will always be a desire. At some point it turns into a hobby, and you live with it. And if it doesn't happen, you can just lie down and die.
SPEAKER_04: engine it's a lifestyle at some point of time you will have to and if if you will not have to then you will have to lay down and die that's it it's lifestyle that's it it will it will be with you forever okay while we breathe we're gonna pull let's try take care guys take care thank you very much guys bye bye everyone who has been watching us
SPEAKER_04: Thank you, guys. Bye. Bye, Denis. Bye. Bye, Denis. Thank you, Paul. Thank you. Thank you, Denis. Bye.
