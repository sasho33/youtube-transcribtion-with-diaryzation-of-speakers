SPEAKER_01: Hello, hello, hello everyone. I hope you all have been doing well. Today we will have two great champions as our guests. One is the previous 105 kg right arm East vs West World Champion Oleg Petrenko.
SPEAKER_01: who in my opinion gave maybe toughest, maybe one of the two toughest ones. I'm talking about left arm. One was against, to Alican Morado. One was, Alican's one tough match was against Ivan Matushenko and the other one was against Oleg Petrenko. Now Oleg Petrenko,
SPEAKER_01: With left arm, he is going for a world title against Betkili Onianii. Betkili Onianii is... Hello, hello, Paolo. Hello. How are you? I'm good, I'm good. How are you doing? Good, good. Is your beard a little bigger than usual? No, it's actually probably the same. I'm trimming that a little bit, but yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, okay, okay. Maybe the camera is coming from a little bit down. Yes, yes, probably. Yeah, that's why, because beard is closer to the camera than your, yeah, now, yeah, now it looks normal. How are you? Good? Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay. Good to see you, the arms, shoulders, everything. What are you hiding there? It's a little cold here. You're hiding something big there. It's a little cold. I see a super heavy weight.
SPEAKER_03: now yeah i have uh i injured my back so i'm again yeah unfortunately so okay one was the left bicep and now the the no it was the left uh left elbow
SPEAKER_03: and it was successful recovery but now i got too strong on the elbow and too happy and i started benching heavy and i tore my back i think i think i think time to bring everything to 90 with more reps instead of uh those uh record breaking limit pushing you know yeah yeah yeah that listen it's time that's it right yeah it's time for everything
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Oleg. Oleg, can you turn the camera sideways? How are you, Oleg? Good? Everything is good. I feel good. Yeah, that's good. That's good. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I was gonna say that like when I was young like I was walking just see I saw a tree that you know and then I would just jump and then do like this like no warm-up nothing you know right now with two hands I really need warm up like 20 minutes and then I can do it with two hands and it may still hurt a little you know yeah that's right listen there is time for everything right
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah yeah yeah yes you you gain some things but you also lose something for sure you know you are probably probably smarter i don't know if we are smarter or we we are not as brave as before i don't know what it is right a little more careful probably yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. Yeah, I'm sure that you also have things that like you have done when you're young. And now you're saying that, oh, you wouldn't do it now. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so how is everything? Or like going 95 kilo? Is it healthier decision for you?
SPEAKER_03: If you weigh 95 kg, is it better for you or what do you think?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, I'm sure that if I lose weight to 95 kg, I will feel better. I will be faster, more resilient. Now I feel that it is easier for me to breathe. Because I gained more than 105 kg, it was a bit difficult for me. I think that now it is not the time to gain more than 105 kg. Therefore, it is possible that at 95 kg I will feel better than at 105 kg.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Oleg's saying, yeah, it's probably a good decision because now when I start losing a little bit, it's easier to breathe and I will be more endured and much faster, he said. So because, yeah, at 105 and more than 105, he said I was a little too heavy. I was out of my breath faster. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I think it is healthier, you know, because the cutter, he is like...
SPEAKER_01: I think he's around 100 kilo and he's just pushing himself to be 105 even more, you know. And I think at 100 kilo, he's like ideal weight and then probably he's not super hard to make lower weight category. I mean, if Devon is making 105. Right. Yeah. With that height.
SPEAKER_03: He says, yes, I agree that this is probably a good idea, that you walk somewhere in Sochi and this is your weight, comfortable, and it will be very easy there to 95 times and already there. He says, well, if Devon, if Larratt, he says, at his age does 105, it makes a difference, right, in height? Well, in fact, it's not hard. I already see how I'm starting to lose weight.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg agrees and he said I eat a little better. I watch what I'm putting in my body and he's already right now at 103.
SPEAKER_03: and he's very slow will drop to 100 or 99 kilos and then last week he will just do a water cut and he'll be right right and how is the power oleg how is the power like like do you like protect that power like do you still have it remaining um
SPEAKER_03: Engin, he's saying that
SPEAKER_03: He's stronger for sure than, let's say, two years ago. And his power is not lacking. His power is still the same. And he hopes that it's going to be even better. But his endurance for any static exercises is much better already. Yeah, yeah. I was... Hello, hello, Roman. Welcome, my friend. Hello. Hello, guys. Hello, Pablo. Yeah. I mean, for someone like Betkili...
SPEAKER_03: He will need that endurance. Either he needs to, like, boom, dominate, or he needs to be ready for a war. Because I know that Badkilly can pull forever. Engin says that Badkilly can fight practically forever. It's endless. So, you need to be either very strong if you fight, or much stronger to fight at the start.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg is saying that the second option is better, to be stronger and just to finish it from the goal. Yeah, that's the game plan but you better finish it if that is what you are
SPEAKER_03: We will see. And how does Oleg see his chances? Oleg, how do you see your chances? I think I'm the favorite of this fight. Oleg, a little louder. I think I'm the favorite of this fight. With all due respect that DeadKill is now a champion. I respect him very much. He is a great champion. But I think I will win.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg is saying that with all the respect to Betkili and he liked the guy and he respected he's absolute champion right now but he thinks that he's favorite Oleg is favorite in this match and that this match will not be too long. It will not be too long. Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay. That's good. That's good. Well, Oleg is learning some competition. Not trash talk, but just being challenging, you know. Yeah, that's good. Roman, can you reach out to Betkele if he has any problems? Sure thing. So Oleg is very confident.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how my translation sounds, but I heard it. He is confident. Yeah, I mean, I heard what you said. I can imagine that. If he is saying that the match will not be that long, let's see what is his response to that.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg is laughing that I commented about it's not a trash talk, but you're learning a little bit. He's like, no, no, I really think that I'm favorite.
SPEAKER_01: okay okay let's see i don't think i don't think that kill is someone to be underestimated and but he says that he's not underestimating he just thinks that he's very good i mean himself is very good he did he did say it
SPEAKER_03: Oleg is saying that yeah he knows and he's not underestimating him for sure that's why he started his training and preparation lots of sparrings with Oleg
SPEAKER_01: Because they used to pull not too long ago and he's getting very serious. Hello, hello, how are you? Fine, and you? Good, good, good. Okay, but can you tell him that he's training with Oleg, but does Oleg think that the style and hand of Oleg
SPEAKER_03: is different than bad kitty the the training still helps his hand probably right but but what if the match goes inside
SPEAKER_03: I understand this, but I don't have a big choice of sparring partners. I have Oleg Zhokh, one of the strongest in Ukraine now on the left hand. There is Vadim Psytsuk, the style is similar to the beat kill. Vadim Psytsuk, I don't know. Ivor Pasyeka. This is Ivor Pasyeka and Vadim, close to the beat kill style. And I'm sparring with them, yes. I understand that there will probably be a fight.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg is saying that, yeah, absolutely. I understand that. And Oleg is not only a sparring partner for me. There is Vadim Stetsiuk and Plaseka. And I do my homework with all of them whose styles are closer to being Kivy. But he said Oleg is one of the strongest left-handers in Ukraine. There is not too many options. And that's what I got.
SPEAKER_01: I have to say this, Oleg Petrenko before you came said that he thinks you are very strong and he by no means underestimates you, but he says that
SPEAKER_01: He's going to win and the match will not be long. What is your response?
SPEAKER_02: Thank you very much. I would like to start by saying that I know that it is very important to know that if you want to do something, you have to do it in a way that is appropriate for you. I know that it is very important to know that. But it is also important to know that you have to be able to do it, and you have to know that you have to be able to do it in a way that is appropriate for you.
SPEAKER_00: It makes no sense to talk about it, because it is a very important issue. I think everyone has a very important role to play. I think everyone has a very important role to play. I think everyone has a very important role to play.
SPEAKER_02: Likewise, I also reckon that Oleg is a very, very tough and strong opponent. I believe the competition will be great, match will be great, and I find it logical that he hopes and thinks that match will finish...
SPEAKER_02: sooner rather than later because of his endurance and lack of hopes of himself to be more endurable than I am. So I believe his approach is logical, but people will show he's good opponent, strong opponent, but match will be tough.
SPEAKER_01: So it means that like what Oleg says is logical because that is his only chance. And by saying that it's going to be a good match, but a tough match, but he's implying that he's going to win because it's going to be a tough match, not a short one. Yeah. Yes. He didn't specifically say that's Oleg's only chance, but that's where he was going to say that. Yeah. Yeah. He said it in a very nice and diplomatic way. Polite way. Paolo.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, Oleg, yes, he says the same. Respect. He says, yes, I know that Oleg is a very serious and powerful opponent. He says it's logical that he thinks so, that he will win. Well, because everyone who comes, comes to win. Oleg says, in principle, I am also preparing. And it will be a difficult match. And in such a
SPEAKER_03: oleg is saying yeah yeah i can see that the killer is getting ready on the camera he looks huge tell him to look at the mirror look at him
SPEAKER_03: Oleg looks this big, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Let me quickly also translate what he asked, what you guys are talking about.
SPEAKER_02: It's like an arsenal, you can't put it in the camera and take a big shot. And then you go to the store and say, if you don't want to go to the store, you have to take a big shot. And then you go to the store and take a big shot. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right.
SPEAKER_02: I'm practically the same that I competed last time. Same size, same weight, same commitment. I'm just trying and getting better. I'm not sure. Maybe he thought I am bigger because he got intimidated by me. Not sure. Or maybe he thought that I'm weaker than he actually realized I am. So not sure. Not sure why he said I'm big. I'm same size as I was last time.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe the camera was a little too close. That's why it appears too big. And he's asking, what's your way to beat Kili?
SPEAKER_03: 100. How about you? 100. 104. OK, Betkili is 100? Yes, Betkili is 100 and Oleg is 104 as of right now.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Let's see. Oleg, how is your sparring with Zhokh? I know that
SPEAKER_03: job told me that you were too strong for him before he pulled bett kelly but is it still the case when you're losing weight he said you were too strong for him before he pulled bett kelly but is it still the case when you're losing weight he said you were too strong for him before he pulled bett kelly but is it still the case when you're losing weight
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Oleg is saying that last time they pulled, it was staying pretty much the same. And he said, yeah, Oleg is very strong, but I know how to pull him. So it's, yeah, same situation. So same situation, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Can you ask Petrenko what his answer is? Does it mean anything to Petrenko that he is dominant against Jokic?
SPEAKER_02: Betkili, I would like to ask you about this. I would like to ask you about this. I would like to ask you about this. I would like to ask you about this. I would like to ask you about this. I would like to ask you about this. I would like to ask you about this.
SPEAKER_02: Petrenko says that the game now is based on his own ideas. Petrenko says that the game now is dominated by reality, because he knows how to deal with it, how to deal with it from this point of view, because there is nothing in reality.
SPEAKER_00: It seems to me that nothing has changed. Petrenko is a very dominant player. He has been playing for a long time. What do you think about this? What do you think about him or not? I don't think about him at all. From the point of view of the fact that he has been playing for a long time, he has lost 14 kilos, and Petrenko has been playing for a long time. I think he will improve a lot in the game.
SPEAKER_00: And I know that if I were to go there, I would have a very difficult time. I don't know what I would have to do with everyone.
SPEAKER_02: uh so practically doesn't change much anything uh for me and my uh assumptions and estimations towards uh my match against oleg petrenko um first of all he's like like he said 104 so
SPEAKER_02: Practically, there is not much changed, I guess, I'm assuming, but even if Oleg is 95 and pulls against Zhokh, I believe that such a weight drop will not play a huge role in Oleg Petrenko's case. He will still be strong and dominant. That's what I believe.
SPEAKER_02: so because of this uh i'm it doesn't change anything for me whether petrenko is still strong or not regardless of losing the weight because i would never estimate or assume that petrenko would get weaker just to drop the weight uh up to down to 95 kg so i'm i'm expecting him to come strong
SPEAKER_01: Oleg, Betkili said that it is going to be a tough match. He disagreed with you that it will be a short supermatch. What if it goes to a long battle? Then in such case, how do you see your chances?
SPEAKER_03: Oleg, Bidkili said that he does not agree with you that it will be such a fast match. He thinks that you will fight and there will be a long fight. And Engin asks, what do you think, what are your chances against Bidkili in a long fight? It is clear that Bidkili considers that he will stop me and we will fight for a long time.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I think I have a chance because, well, less than him in a long fight, let's say. And why is there a chance? Because I train, I fight a lot in long fights, I keep myself static, I prepare myself as a plan B for the fact that I will have to fight for a long time. My hook is quite good on the left hand.
SPEAKER_03: I have a lot of such injuries on the right, but on the left there are fewer. On the left, I fought less. The left is maybe a little weaker physically, but it doesn't hurt anywhere, so I think it's an advantage. So, in principle, I'm ready to fight. There will definitely not be an easy match, I'm sure. Neither for a big kill, nor for me. But I hope to win at least the first round quickly.
SPEAKER_03: Polak is saying, yeah, absolutely, he's right. He hoped for a long match because, yes, he's known for his endurance, but lately I've been working on my endurance. I've been preparing for him to endure him. He believes that...
SPEAKER_03: first few matches anyway he will be dominant enough to finish them fast but he said my hook on the left is very good and my left arm is very healthy and if you compare to my right arm it doesn't have that many injuries and it's maybe not
SPEAKER_03: hundred percent compared to my right arm maybe a 90 something that's a little bit weaker but it's much healthier so i'm you know i'm very confident in my arm plus my preparation is uh mostly endurance right now okay but but he said that he is like 90 percent or something like that compared to his right arm but he yeah he he still has one month and he has been training right because he didn't have left arm match after alija mess
SPEAKER_01: So now, like when you have your right arm ready, pulling a year long, one more month of preparation doesn't really mean anything because you are already trained well. But when your left arm is coming from behind, then that one more month can mean something different compared to the other arm. So does he think that he will also increase his strength because of his left arm not being active and just coming back, you know?
SPEAKER_03: How do you think, Oleg, that you've been bombing your right hand all the time, you've had a lot of matches, but it's just tired. And the left, in principle, rested, and you started training it so actively. Do you think that in this month that you have left, there is such a possibility that your left will progress so much that it will become even stronger than the right? Or do you think that you won't live so long?
SPEAKER_03: I've been training my left leg all the time. I just don't train it at the peak of my weight. Let's say, if my left leg was at 90%, then my right leg was at 100%. But these two years that I haven't been training my left leg, I've been training it all the time. And I've been training it as well. I don't know, I'm not sure if it will be straight to the right, but now I feel good. And in terms of strength, it's already close to the peak of the right leg. For example,
SPEAKER_03: Oleg is saying that he's been always training the left arm also. He just did not, it was unnecessary to bring it to the peak form. So he was keeping that, let's say, he was picking his right arm at 100%.
SPEAKER_03: he was keeping his left around 90%. He said, I'm not sure if I can bring my left overall
SPEAKER_03: the peak form of right but i will be very close but he says for example my wrists my left wrist is much better and left than on my right because right was injured and as he said before his left his mom very much healthier he said my wrist left is better than right so he said it's a little hard to say you know what are we talking about
SPEAKER_02: Maybe you quickly, shortly, translate to Betkili, quickly, and then I ask another question. Betkili, I would like to ask you about the way in which Oleg's life has changed. And I would like to start with the fact that Oleg said that he was going to die, that he was going to die, that he was going to die, that he was going to die, that he was going to die, that he was going to die,
SPEAKER_02: And that's why I think it's important to say that, in my opinion, it is very important for me to say that, because the price will increase by 90% and Alizhan's store will not be closed.
SPEAKER_02: And, of course, I would like to point out that there is a lot of talk about the possibility of a revolution in the future. I mean, who would believe that there will be a great revolution? I mean, there is a lot of talk about it, because... Who would believe that there will be a great revolution? Who would believe that there will be a great revolution? Who would believe that there will be a great revolution?
SPEAKER_02: So as I was translating to him, I was practically almost finished. He was like, if Oleg is so sure that he's gonna end up winning short times, why is he training for endurance?
SPEAKER_03: Probably plan B, plan A, plan B, but let's ask to himself. I will ask, but he already answered that when he said that he's pretty sure that first few matches he will win.
SPEAKER_02: fast but he's training for endurance in case that then but i can i can re-ask but he already kind of answered okay okay okay then i will just quickly tell the answer to that uh uh
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so I want to ask Betkili, was Betkili surprised when I offered him this match? Was he like, oh, okay, finally I cleaned the category and I was going to go up to 105 and now Engin brought someone from 105 and probably tougher than anyone who has met so far?
SPEAKER_02: Vergil, your emotion, your reaction, your expression of interest, when you say, first of all, that now you are going to be 28, then you will be 45 kilos. There are two variants, according to me, of such an emotion. First of all, how did you come to be 45 kilos for me?
SPEAKER_02: The second option is that I would like to be in the 15 kg category. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in 2015. And I would like to be in the 15 kg category in
SPEAKER_00: Right.
SPEAKER_02: Well, regardless of the weight category, I was expecting to pull Petrenko relatively soon, but I'm happy that it's happening at 95 kg. I'm somewhat really excited for it and happy.
SPEAKER_02: uh but uh me being uh my reaction has never been uh so that uh once i know my opponent uh i would be like oh i'm definitely gonna uh secure the belt i have never had opponents so far that angry throw at me that would cause such a reaction in my uh mind so they were always tough for me and so is petrenko and i'm really excited to have a match against him this soon
SPEAKER_03: Let me translate for Oleg a little bit, just 5 seconds. Oleg Engin asks, I was a little surprised when you thought that I had already beaten everyone in 95, and I gave you a surprise, and my colleague added, he replies, well, no, I still knew that we would meet with Oleg, or in 105, if I went up.
SPEAKER_03: In 1995, when Oleg came to me, he said that he was very pleased that it was happening in 1995. I never wondered that someone was weaker or stronger. At this level, all the opponents were worthy and strong. I always knew that I would meet Oleg.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Oleg's saying the same. Yeah, absolutely. He said we have to pull everybody and on this such a level there is no weak people. Everybody is strong and everybody is good.
SPEAKER_01: In the chat, people are talking about how serious you are. Some people say that you have never smiled in your entire life. So do you think that if you put six of the same photo of you,
SPEAKER_01: and like six of them and then if you would write that killing when he is happy but killing when he is angry but killing when he is excited but killing when he is i don't know like do you think that they would that there would be uh uh writing to do yeah yeah yeah that's a it's a funny thing uh
SPEAKER_02: In the comments, there are some people who say that Betkili didn't do it on purpose, he didn't do it on purpose, he didn't do it on purpose, he didn't do it on purpose, he didn't do it on purpose, he didn't do it on purpose, he didn't do it on purpose,
SPEAKER_02: Same exact pose. Same exact pose. Yeah, that's what I said. Yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He said that if I have to smile or laugh, how can I say, forceful way, I would rather just not laugh at all, you know. So it has to be really funny. Does that give you a smile naturally as well?
SPEAKER_01: right now i'm smiling oh this this is his smile okay that's good good bad killing yeah tell him to not to take it wrong we love that killing
SPEAKER_03: Oleg, they just joke a little with him, I can't put it into words. Someone once wrote that Betkili is actually smiling. They say, let's post six photos of the same person from Betkili. He says he's happy, he's not happy, he's happy. I think that's the only thing that matters in the podcast.
SPEAKER_02: He wants to tell you that when he watched Ermes and Michael's podcast, he was laughing. He was laughing, yeah. Yeah. Betkili, give us a favor. When you are laughing, do a selfie and send me.
SPEAKER_01: I will share with the community. Sure thing, you can expect. That's good. This is right now, imagine it is February 16th.
SPEAKER_02: Where will the 95-kilo World Champion belt be? I think it will be released in the year 2025. I think it will be released in the year 2025. I think it will be released in the year 2025.
SPEAKER_02: It's going to be around my waist. It is right now, currently, around my waist, the belt. And I'm seeing February 16th, it will be the same waist. Same waist, okay. First of all, this is a very important question.
SPEAKER_00: I was born on March 22nd, and I lived in Kamri since 1985. I don't know why I was born on March 22nd. I was born in Kamri.
SPEAKER_02: both of my previous opponents may have thought that it's uh easier to take the belt as it turned out to be for instance the tyno may have thought that it's not that hard to keep uh the belt and win the third time but i proved him wrong and also oleg uh even though he beat me at 85 kg he thought that it would be maybe easy to take the belt again at 95 but i proved him wrong again so
SPEAKER_01: we'll see okay maybe paulo yeah where the belt will be same question no no i mean you can translate what i said first and then you can ask the same question and then i will ask them one more thing and then we can uh
SPEAKER_03: Where do you see that belt? He says, well, I just looked at it once in a while, and I see it around the same waist, and around it he is now. And later commented, he says, well, I already had a couple of opponents, they also thought that they could win. This time, Oleg also thinks that he will win, he says, but I will try, I will prove to everyone
SPEAKER_03: Oleg is making a mistake now. The belt will stay where it is. I understand. I'm also going to win. I think he understands that I'm going to take this belt. He has it in the country, he has it to win. Yes, it will not be easy, maybe, but it will be the taste of victory, the best. Okay. And Otengin asks you the same thing. He says, now you've looked into the future. He says, on February 16th. Yes. That's clear.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg's saying that, yeah, listen, he said, I am going there to win also. We're both going there to win, but in his country, it's not going to be the easiest way for me to win it, but I will prove that it's possible. Yeah. Okay. Another question for Berghiri. Berghiri, do you think that as of now, Petrenko,
SPEAKER_01: is the toughest opponent that you will be meeting so far at the East vs West? Under 95kg, do you see anyone who could be a tougher opponent than Petrenko? Not you.
SPEAKER_02: Petrenko is ranked in the 95th category. In the 95th, Petrenko has the highest score in the world, and Petrenko is the only one who has the highest score in the world. Of course, I'm not the only one who thinks that he is the only one. I think everyone is different.
SPEAKER_00: From my point of view, I don't think there will be a real conflict. Are there any variants that Petrenko will come from the left? In the past, there was a level of conflict. Petrenko came from the left, Gjergirov came from the right, and Dar Shemkhodri came from the left. There was a conflict between the left and the right-wing people.
SPEAKER_02: For me, it would be easier to answer the question once the competition is done, because I have never actually felt Petrenko's left arm, how strong it is. So judging by my assumptions, I would say that yes, definitely Petrenko is so far my toughest opponent. However,
SPEAKER_02: that could be, there could be someone even stronger who could come down to the 95 kg and be stronger. But like I said, I don't know Petrenko's hand 100%. I'm not sure about me saying that Petrenko's, Petrenko, someone could be even stronger than Petrenko in 95 kg. Okay. The person who can come down and be stronger than Petrenko, then it could be probably Alijan. Alijan,
SPEAKER_00: Yes, that's right. What do you think about Alizhan? If, for example, Alizhan was born in 1995, would it be possible for Petrenko to have a very long life? I don't know exactly how to say it. I don't know exactly how to say it. What I know is that when Petrenko and Alizhan were born, their lives and what they had to go through were different. But Alizhan's life was 95 kilometers long.
SPEAKER_00: And then, in 1995, I went to the US, and I was there for two years. I was there for six months.
SPEAKER_02: important thing is that uh weight loss affects athletes differently so that's another factor to consider when we are talking about let's say alijan dropping down the weight and be possibly stronger opponent than oleg could have been for me however one thing i noticed maybe production team made mistake or maybe there was no mistake and it was really like this but when alijan and oleg pulled each other
SPEAKER_02: Lefty there was a weight for Alijan was written 95 kg so I would not be even surprised if 95 kg Alijan managed to beat Oleg but probably it was mistake like some some technical issue I need to check the the my notes you know if it is how is this and another question bad killing if you win this match would you like to
SPEAKER_02: pull at 105 as your next match? Anush, this level is very difficult. It was difficult for Malin Jantano to pull at 45 kg. He wanted to pull at 285. This match, when he was able to do it, he couldn't do it. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not going to leave 95 kg. Definitely not. This category is mine. However, I would gladly take the opportunity if it's given for me to compete at both categories. Yeah, this is what I was thinking. And Oleg, who would you like to pull right arm at 95 kg? We have Irakli, we have
SPEAKER_01: Rustam, what is your countryman? We have Tata Sings, we have Kanayi. Who would you wish to pull? What do you think your chance is to win the world title in 95-kilometer right arm? Let me translate real fast what the previous conversation was about in a couple of seconds.
SPEAKER_03: In the mid-kill, Engin asked if he would like to fight in the 105th division if he wins the match. He said he would stay in the 95th division, but if he offers to fight in two divisions at once, he will certainly agree.
SPEAKER_03: It's very short. And the question was for you in the 95th category. I have Irakli, I have Rustam on the right hand, I have Tad Hutchings. Who do you think you want to fight and do you think there are any chances for you to win the title on the right hand? Well, I think I have more chances on the right hand.
SPEAKER_01: Listen, it doesn't always work that way.
SPEAKER_01: Sometimes A beats B, B beats C, C beats A, and sometimes 105 and 95 difference. And nobody gives you the belt without actually putting your elbow on the pad and pinning your opponent four times. So Dusty thinks that he doesn't have any interesting opponent there, is what he thinks.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg says, you know that it doesn't always work that way, there is one, the other is beaten, there are different styles and so on. And no one will pull your belt on your stomach without you putting your elbow on the pillow and pressing your opponent to the other pillow. Do you think you don't have such interesting opponents there? No, I think there are interesting opponents, I just answered if I have a chance, so I wanted to say that I have a great chance, I think.
SPEAKER_03: Of course, it won't be easy, because I think Irakli has progressed. And we'll see Todd Hutchings now. I can't even say for sure who will win. I think Irakli, but Todd Hutchings can. I believe he can beat Irakli. Well, Rustam is still there, right? Rustam, Pauline. In principle, I have such an idea now.
SPEAKER_03: I have a plan or maybe a dream to win this match and then if you will double title
SPEAKER_03: If you will propose, he said, it's very interesting. All of them are very interesting and very strong. And he said, I understand. And I just said that my chances winning both and right arm also even probably better than my left because I've been winning. And he explained why he thinks that his chances. But he said, listen, that Hutchings, we don't know what form he's going to bring. He thinks progressing very well. He said, listen, everybody's interesting.
SPEAKER_01: He said, there is a plan on Dream. If you will propose to him some good matches, he said, absolutely, double title. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We will keep them. I will keep them busy. They don't worry. The guy who brought Petrenko down to 95 to keep Badkili busy. And yeah, we'll do some things. Devon't worry about it. He will keep you busy. Devon't worry, everything will be fine.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you. Okay, so let's talk about the other matches. But, Billy, who is winning? Bacho or Brett Grundy? Bacho is a competitor. I mean, he's been fighting with Matt Musk for a long time. He's a great fighter.
SPEAKER_02: Since the match was announced, I checked out who is Bacho's opponent. I saw his matches, I saw Brian's matches, him versus Matt Mask and it was impressive. However, I think that Bacho will be the leader throughout the match and there will be no doubt about it.
SPEAKER_01: Bacho, Bacho winner. Bacho winner? Yeah, Bacho. Okay. Yeah, because people kind of underestimated Bacho after he lost to Reno, but then we saw Reno winning the world title in 105 kilos against Sago, so now we can understand how good Bacho is, you know.
SPEAKER_01: And yeah, of course, and he's also young. He's probably progressing faster than majority of the East-West pullers, yeah. And let's go to Frank Lamparelli versus Serhii Kalinichenko, 115 kilo. Betkili. Okay, okay. Betkili. I'm interested in what will happen to Sergei. I'm very happy for him and for me.
SPEAKER_00: It's been a long time since I've seen all these lanterns. There are about 30-40 lanterns.
SPEAKER_02: Very interesting match. If I'm not mistaken, Serhii Kalinichenko has to drop his weight. And Lamparelli is a really tough opponent. And even if there was not a weight loss for Serhii, I would still pick Lamparelli as a favorite in this match. I assume 70 to 30% Lamparelli would win. Okay. And Oleg?
SPEAKER_03: I want and believe that my fellow countryman Kalinichenko will win, but after the Michael Todd-Lamparelli fight, I really liked Lamparelli. His fight is very strong and it will be very difficult with Ryu. A very interesting match. I want Kalinichenko to win. I want Kalinichenko to win. And who will win?
SPEAKER_03: 50-50. Yeah, Oleg is saying that very tough match, very interesting match. He said, I really want that Kalinichenko will win, but he said it's going to be 50-50 match. He likes Lamparelli after monster match, Michael Todd. He's a very tough opponent and he said, I don't know. Incredible hand control, you know. Yeah. Yeah. And let's go to the woman match.
SPEAKER_02: Fia Reisek vs. Malin Bergström. I think it's going to be 20-30-30. They are both strong and strong. 50-50. It's an extremely close match. It's tough to predict who is the winner. Plus, they are really good friends. Maybe friendship will win. No, maybe. That one is going to win for sure. But yeah.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah at the end yeah you're right and in french it's what we just said yeah yeah yeah and you oleg everyone is careful about woman matches they don't want to get in trouble that's right because that woman is gonna come you bet against me huh you know
SPEAKER_00: Let's go to another match. Vasily Dautashvili vs. Trojan Golemanov. I don't know if it was a one-on-one fight or not. It was a one-on-one fight. It was a very tough fight. It was a very tough fight. I was very nervous.
SPEAKER_00: He is in a very good shape. He has no problems in this regard. He is a very good leader. He is a very good fighter. He is a very good fighter. He is a great fighter.
SPEAKER_02: This is a very good matchup. They are both pulling the same style. They are very good, extremely efficient and good top rollers. They both have really good wrist. Vasily has been like Vasily several months ago and Vasily today is a completely different breed, so to say, completely different arm wrestler.
SPEAKER_02: I assume that had he been not confident about his victory, had he not taken this match. So I'm sure that he is coming for the victory. And I think he's like everything in this match. And also, also Betkili said that he watched Vasily qualifiers when he first qualifier was. And he seemed very dominant in entire category. Yeah, yeah. Istanbul finals. Yeah, yeah. And Oleg?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I think Vasyl will win. I've seen that he's progressed a lot lately. He's experienced and he has a very technical fight. I don't think he'll have any problems with winning.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Oleg is thinking that Vasily's progress is very good over last time and he said experience and he doesn't think that he will have big problems to win. Again, Stoyan, okay. I understand, yeah. Okay, let's go. This one I know what...
SPEAKER_00: Oleg is going to answer for sure, but let me start with Betkili. Betkili, 85 kilo, Oleg Dzok versus Daniel Prokopchuk. Oleg Dzok versus Daniel Prokopchuk.
SPEAKER_00: I believe this is going to be extremely tough match for Oleg considering how strong and how well connected Prokopchuk is.
SPEAKER_02: I'm sure most likely first two rounds will be no doubt Oleg will sweep and will beat. But after second round, so when third round begins, I'm really not sure what's going to happen. In the end, I'm still thinking that Oleg is going to win, but it's going to be tough for him. And Oleg? I think it's going to be tough.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's a very similar opinion, by the way. So Oleg's saying that, yeah, Zhokh is
SPEAKER_03: uh progressing very well he's been pulling him during the practices and he said he's in better shape than when he was pulling uh with kitty and he's still progressing but he said that he's most likely gonna win but he said danielle is very talented and he very possibly will stop the match in about the third round yeah they have the same exact opinion yeah
SPEAKER_01: And this one, I only want percentage Roman. Betkili Onianii versus Oleg Petrenko. As always, my match prediction against my opponents, 50-50. 50% against 50.
SPEAKER_03: And Oleg, only percentage? Oleg, only percentage. I said that I consider myself a favorite, so 70 to 30. Oleg says that he believes that he is a favorite and that's why he thinks 70-30. 70-30, okay. Roman, you tell this to Betkely so we can... Yes, Betkely understood and he said, we will see. He said, we will see. He said, we will see.
SPEAKER_00: He said Ulysses. Ulysses, who's favorite? Okay. Okay, so let's go. Irakli Zirakashvili, Tata Shings. I'm very interested in the future of Irakli. I'm very interested in the future of Irakli.
SPEAKER_02: Since their first match, which Tozilla ended up winning, everybody who has seen any piece of armwrestling could tell the huge progress that Irakli has had.
SPEAKER_02: i'm thinking that it's gonna be not easy but iraqi will for sure win but it's gonna be a match like it's not gonna be very easy for him but that that's interesting because usually nobody wants to have a war with uh tart hutchings okay let's go to oleg
SPEAKER_03: I will give a little advantage to Irakli for his progress in the last fights, but I think that he is very interesting and difficult for two sportsmen in a fight. And he may be strong. And if he is strong, then Hutchings will win. Although I will give a little advantage to Irakli.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg is saying that a small favorite to Irakli because he is progressing that fast and that good. But he says also that it's very possible that it's going to be a prolongated match. And if it's became that direction and be, you know, long match, then Tad Khachans will win. But he still thinks that Irakli is a slight favorite. Okay, let's go to David Dadikyan versus Alex Kurdecha.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I believe that we're going to win this match and pretty easy. However, it may be surprising. Yes. That's interesting. That's interesting. And Oleg?
SPEAKER_03: I think Kurdecha will win. Although I don't know how far I've gained. I've heard he's gained a lot now. More than 120 kilos, they say. I think Kurdecha will still be stronger. He will open David's bones. Although the match is interesting, anything can happen. I think Kurdecha will win.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg thinks that Kurdecha will win and he knows that David gained a lot and he said it's a very interesting match still, but he believes that Kurdecha will be able to open up his wrist because of his abilities and he's going to win. And Paolo, I want to ask you a few of them. First this one, what do you think about this match? The Dikean Kurdecha? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's complicated for me to answer. It's very much depends on what form Kordachev will bring. If he will be in his top shape, I believe that he's favorite. But we don't know how good is he recovered from the injury. And that he can is not an easy opponent. So if he's... Left arm, I don't think he has... Left arm he has injury? I didn't know. I think he has right arm. It was right arm. Yeah, yeah. No, I believe, yeah. I believe that Kordachev will win.
SPEAKER_01: okay another one bread versus butcher because you pull against bread i pulled against it when you look at bread when you look at bread like i mean you don't see anything dangerous when you look at it no but the hand control and everything he's very interesting opponent uh but butcher will win this time butcher is better oh you think okay yes i don't think there is a huge difference but there is a difference
SPEAKER_03: Okay, and then Irakli versus Todd? After I pulled Todd Hutchings a year ago on the practice, I will never beat against Todd Hutchings in my life. I believe he will win. Oh, Todd Hutchings will win, you think? Okay. Irakli is amazing, but he will stop the match at some point, and that's it. Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, let's go to the last three ones. Michael Todd versus Ermes Gasparini. It's interesting. For me, there is a lot of competition.
SPEAKER_00: But I think that, as we all know, it's not easy for me to work in the same field as Gasparini. He was a great player, and he will always be a great player. But he made a lot of progress in Gasparini's career. I don't know if he was in his 20s or 30s, but he was a great leader, and I think Gasparini was a great player.
SPEAKER_02: It's an extremely interesting match, very exciting. He recalled that they have never pulled since the first time they met many years ago. However, he still thinks that this time match will go almost the same way, same direction, same style.
SPEAKER_02: uh they both had huge progress and in bet gillis opinion slight favorite is hermes he may end up being a dominant leader of the match like to to take the match to the direction but it will be very hard for both of them to manage the uh ticket for the number one so it's it's really good match slight favorite terms and paulo what is your own opinion
SPEAKER_03: I will give this slight favorite to opposite direction to Michael Todd. His progress is amazing and there is not too many options to beat Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_03: in my opinion hermes doesn't have that key this time to beat michael because hermes is favorite in some of the moves but uh it's not it's not the moves how you beat monster so in first rounds it's may finish
SPEAKER_03: uh towards hermes but hermes endurance will not let him finish the whole series and i believe that uh michael is slight favorite uh overall it's most likely not gonna be you know four zero or something uh most likely it is the best of five the best of five it's not gonna be like three yeah i'm sorry three zero or something so you are expecting a three two three two or three one three two yes okay
SPEAKER_03: And you, Oleg? Well, I think that Michael Todd is the best. He's on a winning streak right now. And I think he's going to win. I'm sure it's going to be 3-2, 3-1. Because the first round will most likely be a draw. But I think that Michael Todd is going to stop Ermes.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Oleg's opinion is similar with mine. He said that most likely Michael Todd is favorite, but most likely not 3-0, maybe 3-1 or 3-2. He said most likely Gasparini will take a first round and then Michael will stop the match and will turn it around. And Devon versus Genadi Betkely.
SPEAKER_00: When I look at all of them, I think of Genadi Gajemardz, but I don't know what to say about him. I don't know what kind of form he will be in, what kind of process he will go through. I don't know. I don't think he will be able to win this match. Yes, I think he will be able to win this match. I don't know if he will be able to win this match. I think Genadi will be able to win this match, but I don't know what will happen.
SPEAKER_02: Last time they met Genadi ended up victorious. This time I'm not sure because he's been recovering still to this day from his injury.
SPEAKER_02: And we have seen also Devon changing the weight and coming back. So it's going to be 50-50. Then I asked, what about favorite? What do you think? Who is the favorite? He said, it's hard to say. I can't say who is favorite. I would say 50-50. And Paolo?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I would probably support BitKitty's opinion. I don't know. It's super close and it's very much depends on those little things. Because Genadi is in home country, I may give him just a little bit. I agree. He will be fired up even more. Yes. And Devon will also come with a motivation to not lose twice. So it is just...
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I can tell you this way on the paper, Devon, like if you do math, Devon is favorite. But when you are talking about Genadi, it is, it may be two times two, six, you know, because the math with Genadi, it just doesn't work. It doesn't work. It's not the athlete you can calculate. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm expecting.
SPEAKER_01: Hell of a match. The stage, Genadi up there, Devon is there, and then all those Georgians. I don't want to mention the number, but the ticket that is already sold is already, one month before the event, is more than anything that happened till today. You just calculate the rest. And how do you see this one, Oleg?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I think Devon is right, because I saw a video on YouTube where he said that he's in the best shape right now. And if he's in the best shape, then I think he's right. Although Genadi will give a 100% fight.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Oleg's thinking that Devon is slight favorite and he was watching his videos and Devon's saying that he's in very good shape and if that's the truth that Devon is slight favorite but he said that Genadi will give a hell of a fight 100%. Yeah. I understand. And then let's go to the
SPEAKER_01: super heavyweight world title match and Artem Morozov versus Vitalii Laletin. Artem Morozov, people think that he won seven matches in a row. He is the current super heavyweight world champion. But people think that Laletin is favorite and Morozov doesn't talk a lot. But we suddenly see him over 140 kilo.
SPEAKER_03: And let's start with you, Paulo. It's a very complicated match to predict. Artyom is amazing. Vitalii's progress is amazing over the past year or so. It's hard to predict. But I believe that this time Artyom should manage it. But it's 51 to 49.
SPEAKER_01: I will give it to Artyom. You give it to Artyom? Artyom is the favorite. Yes. Okay. You just tell me the way you picture of him winning. Like style. Low grip.
SPEAKER_03: uh pronation control you know he he will have to grip low on uh lalitin and control his pronation like you usually do because of his fingers length is allowed the way that he did to alex kordes around one and then yes yes yes but people think that it's impossible to hook
SPEAKER_01: I agree with those people who think so, because nobody did it before, but Artyom is different. That's why he's number one for seven times, correct? Yeah, whenever he pulled against Corey West in Dubai, I think he even held him low and did really good.
SPEAKER_03: But Vitalii, we know, is a different animal. He's amazing. He's absolutely amazing. But I believe it's a utopia and it's very hard to anybody who thinks that they can top-roll Vitalii's top-roll. It's kind of complicated. And Betkili? I think everyone knows that Vitalii will be the winner and Vitalii will be the winner.
SPEAKER_02: Many people, majority people believe that Vitalii is favorite and he's going to end up having his goblet. However, I'm sure if Morozov, once he is able to contain Vitalii and somehow stop his search,
SPEAKER_02: From that moment, we will go on Morozov's side throughout the rest of the match. In Betkili's opinion, Morozov has a chance to win. But he didn't say percentage. Morozov has a chance to win? Or Morozov has more chance than Vitalii? Yeah, I was about to ask him percentage, who has more chance. How many percent do you think Morozov has more chance? Morozov has more chance than Vitalii.
SPEAKER_01: Exactly like Paolo, 55 to 45 for Morozov. You also said the same, Paolo, right? No, I think he said 51-49. Same idea. But that's interesting because these two opinions are already like opposite of the general opinion. And you, Petrenko?
SPEAKER_03: I think 50-50. Vitalii adds to every fight, and Morozov is a champion. He has already defended this title a few times. He can't be underestimated. And I think he's still progressing to this fight. I saw he added Wazir. So 50-50. I can't say for sure.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg will not put anybody above another guy and he said 50-50 because Laletin and his surge up, but Morozov is a champion and he's been, you know, defeating his belt so far successfully, so he doesn't know, he's 50-50, he said. Okay, that's interesting.
SPEAKER_01: That's interesting, because that's not what I lately hear. Okay, another... What is your opinion, Engin? He's not gonna say. There is no way he's gonna say. Engin, I am not asking you to give us a favorite, but what do you think the match will go like? I mean, I can write you a few different scenarios. You never know what can happen. I mean, the hooking,
SPEAKER_01: the hook in Vitalii with that explosiveness, you know, like whenever you put, just say a hundred kilos on your hand to do wrist curl, but you put with like, you took it with two hands and then slowly put on your knee and curl. And then whenever you put that hundred kilo,
SPEAKER_01: from one and a half centimeter away from your wrist and then suddenly leave it. And your wrist will go like, you know, because of that hit, you know. So that hit that Vitalii does is very, very effective. So it is very, very hard to control that. But if he's controlled, we see that Vitalii is not,
SPEAKER_01: But we have two opposite guys. One is once he stops the match, he makes hell for his opponent. And one is that incredibly hard to stop because of that explosiveness. But once it stops, it looks like it goes to like 70% of the actual beginning hits.
SPEAKER_01: He stops 100%, and then if he stops, he goes to 70%. While Morozov is at 70%, and then once the man stops, he's just, you know, stronger and stronger. So it's all about, like, if he can stop him. But I remember one match, Alexander Getalo versus Vitalii Laletin in 2015 World Championships. It was more than 10 minutes. Long match.
SPEAKER_01: you were there right in malaysia yeah and 10 minutes the whole table the whole table was just like like it rained you know just like like not only wet but the water was there you know like the sweating you know both guys after 10 minutes or 11 minutes and and then just get all just
SPEAKER_01: I was very, very impressed with the patience of Vitalii. Anyways, we will see how it will be. One more question and we finish. Who is the person that has the highest chance against
SPEAKER_01: I'm not saying if it's more than Levan's, but who has, compared to others, more chance? Let's start with Betkili. I think it's not interesting for everyone to say the same thing, because Gasparini is not the only one.
SPEAKER_00: He is a great leader and a great example of a great general of Lebanon. I think that all of us should have been with Gasparini. We should have been with him in the first place. But I think that we should have been with Gasparini in the first place. But Gasparini and Michael have a lot of chances to win. That's true.
SPEAKER_02: right uh in my opinion whoever wins as the winner of the match uh between michael todd and ermis gasparini that winner guy is the guy who has the most chance currently against the one i i me personally we asked and make sure what he meant and he said yes either michael or ermis nobody else has currently more more chance against le one uh and he said between these two guys
SPEAKER_02: If Ermes ends up pulling Levan, in Betkele's opinion, that match would be slightly more interesting, at least in his own opinion, because of so far what we have seen is that Levan struggled against Ermes the most. And it would be interesting to see how differently he's going to approach this time. And yeah, that's basically what he said. And you? Here's the answer.
SPEAKER_03: Paolo? It's a little bit complicated question, but yeah. But do you agree that these three people as of now, maybe also Laletin, are also there? Laletin is definitely there. The problem with Levan is how often did we see that somebody top-rolled Levan? It's, you know, to the point it's almost impossible.
SPEAKER_03: So probably to me it would be the most interesting to see how Monster will perform against Levan as of right now, because we saw Ermes and I believe that Ermes and Monster will have probably similar chances, but I would love to see how Monster will perform. But I want to tell you that
SPEAKER_03: For Monster it's much easier to win with Ermes than with Levan because of the hand size and because of the styles what they can pull. Levan can do much more damage to Monster's pronation than Ermes can. And you, Oleg? Yes, I also think that Michael Todd can stop Levan.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg believes that Monster is one of the not too many people who can try to stop him and try to make the match interesting. Do you guys have any message to each other?
SPEAKER_00: Roman doesn't understand. I mean, he translates it. Last like half an hour, he understood everything. So unfortunately, I was .
SPEAKER_00: First of all,
SPEAKER_02: very glad and very uh happy to finally see that this event has been posted in my country and each and every one of you guys whoever has taken small at least small parts or some type of part in hosting this and making this event in georgia
SPEAKER_02: Huge thanks to all you guys. I'm really excited to see this event. I hope that we Georgians will show our love in such a fashion, our love towards to armwrestling in such a fashion that entire armwrestling world, like world of armwrestling will be like stunned and astonished.
SPEAKER_02: I also hope that we will host you guys very well and show you how hospitable we are. And basically, this is my thanks to you guys and excitement about this upcoming event in my home country. And Oleg, any last words? Well, I'm looking forward to this ISTWEST16. I'm looking forward to it.
SPEAKER_03: I think we will have a good match, an interesting one. BadKill is very strong and I am very well prepared for it. I hope that everything will work out for me. I still have a question for Engin. Who will win in our pair?
SPEAKER_03: uh yeah the message is uh that he is uh very glad that this match is happening and uh he uh respect but kitty very much and uh he thinks it's a very strong and good opponent and he's getting ready very well and he got a question uh for engine engine who do you think will win between two of us
SPEAKER_01: Now let me be so diplomatic. The friendship! Friendship. Friendship. Friendship wins. The real answer is for sure arm wrestling and fans. That's for sure. The real answer is arm wrestling and friendship.
SPEAKER_01: Tell them, I said this many times, Roman, you also please translate that.
SPEAKER_01: I said this many times, Paulo, that like some people have problems with the management of the WAF and this and that. But if you realize that like all of these champions are like 90 something percent of them race in WAF. And I spent all my life there and just these guys were just pulling in front of me.
SPEAKER_01: Like I was always thinking like these guys are the best ones and nobody really talks about them, you know? And so now they are slowly getting what they deserve and they are superstars. I am a fan of each of them.
SPEAKER_01: Each, like all of them, like they are just like our superstars. Like, I mean, yeah, there is Messi, Ronaldo, other sport disciplines, but this is what we love the most. And these are, as I said before, are Ronaldo, are Messi, are Neymar or whatever, you know? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg Hengin said, he addressed me, but I will also translate it to everyone who speaks Ukrainian, he says, listen, this is our sport, and a lot of people have problems with our management, but I spent my whole life in this organization, I saw them all on the stage, and I am the biggest fan of our stars who are just starting to gain what they deserve.
SPEAKER_03: And I love them all, I'm your biggest fan. We have different players from football, Ronaldo and so on. And we have our stars in armwrestling, whom I love and I'm a fan of them. Well, we also, I will say from myself, are excited about East West, the team, Engin, that they have created such a mass, as I said, in armwrestling, these tournaments.
SPEAKER_03: In return Oleg saying that we are big fans of your team and you engine that you created such a machine where we can realize our real level. Yeah, but you still didn't get even
SPEAKER_00: 10% of what you deserve, but that is unfortunately, that is the reality right now, but everything will be better here. Let me quickly also translate, because it was your wish. Thank you very much, and thank you very much for the interview. As a European citizen, I would like to say that I have been working for 20 years in different categories.
SPEAKER_00: I remember when I was young, I used to go to school, and I used to go to school every day, and I used to go to school every day, and I used to go to school every day, and I used to go to school every day,
SPEAKER_00: The organizer of this tournament, who is an engineer, helped me a lot, and I was able to participate in the tournament in 2019.
