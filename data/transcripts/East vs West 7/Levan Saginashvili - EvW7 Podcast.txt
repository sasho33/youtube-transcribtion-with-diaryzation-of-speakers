SPEAKER_03: Yeah. So you are also an arm master, correct? Well, yeah, I started this summer, but I was 110 kilos when I started. First, my goal was to lose some weight. In short term, I wasn't thinking about a huge progress. But when I lost the weight, unfortunately, I broke my hand. You actually saw me. I had a plaster cast on my hand.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you came to the last, last esports request, yeah. Yes, yes, yes, exactly. Now I'm just rehabbing the hand. But actually, it is very interesting. My palm grew half a centimeter longer. I can actually show it here. Look at the pink of finger. The right one is definitely way longer now.
SPEAKER_03: okay way upper you see here at least half centimeter normally finger is same but palm grew longer because this metal cut bone got broken it got fractured oh okay so it separated normally it just got broken like this but when they put it in its place i don't know why maybe it grew itself so
SPEAKER_03: It just happened to be, I realized it's a little longer now. And who is your foreign, international favorite armwrestler? Oh my God, I'm a huge fan. It's a very, very difficult question for me. Very difficult to answer. Yeah. How are you, my friend? The King. The King, the strongest armwrestler ever. According to the fans. I made a poll.
SPEAKER_04: 65% said that you are the strongest ever. We are waiting for Tornike. And Levan, we have a new format. When I host superstars like yourself, I'm having one fan to join us.
SPEAKER_01: So that, you know, the pen can, yeah, yeah, yeah. And thank you, thank you for coming and being our guest, Levan. Thank you. So how are you, how are you, Levan? Good, good. I started training. I lost nine kilos now. Nine kilos, wow. Nine kilos. I want to be 175. 175.
SPEAKER_04: off season or competition time? In competition maybe one 72, 33. Oh, in competition you will even go a little bit lower? Yes. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you don't do this only by diet. You also do some cardio? Yeah, yeah. Diet and...
SPEAKER_01: hard cardio too much too much no or when i try to your after training i do yeah i think tony came as well hello hello nice to see you nice to see you too yeah
SPEAKER_04: So this is the goat, right? Goat of translators. Yeah, yeah. Powerful belt. The best translator ever. Thank you. Thank you. Powerful belt. Yeah. Anyway, so... Okay, so Levan just told us that, you know, he... Okay, you said you lost 9 kilos. What are you now? Your weight? 180? Oh, 130, yes. 180. So you will lose 5 more kilos.
SPEAKER_01: I think you will be faster, in my opinion. Levan is saying that he had some thyroid issues even before the match.
SPEAKER_00: he was dealing with that so uh that's probably why the weight uh he came in during the match was uh even higher than he expected oh okay okay i understand yeah and how is his health right now how is your health like are you do you have anything
SPEAKER_00: He's working with doctors now, so all the thyroid related issues should be resolved and they're going good. In terms of injuries, he has none and it's quite surprising for him.
SPEAKER_04: already on the third or fourth day after the match, he was already good to go for the training. No physical injuries at all. Normally, normally after a super match, I remember that he was resting for some time. He started because there is another match in the end of July. Yep. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I understand. And Levan,
SPEAKER_04: You won, you won, you still remain as the king, but you had some hard time. Do you think that the hard time you had in this last match was the endurance problem or because Levan, you are so dominant for many years, boom, boom, boom, boom, you need to like to
SPEAKER_04: technically improve yourself, you need to have some challenge, right? Somebody needs to really find something that you can say, oh, okay. But if you are dominating everyone, what would you progress more? You understand, right, Tony K? Yeah. Because you are just going like this. So does he think that in this match, the problem was with his endurance or he made any, there is some problem
SPEAKER_01: that, you know, in his preparation, which one was it? I don't know which one, so I'm just asking. Levan, do you have anything to add? No, I don't have anything to add. Yes, how do you think? Yes, there was a lot of problems, but not everything is the same. The first thing I would like to say is that they are very good, and they did not do it in the same way as they did in the past. I think they did not do it in the same way as they did in the past.
SPEAKER_01: There was. And the problem was that the real motivation for me was not that kind of motivation that I had with the chef, or with other people, or with Lara. I had all kinds of motivation, but I didn't have the courage to motivate myself.
SPEAKER_01: There were several issues at hand that he had during the preparation.
SPEAKER_00: One of them was that it was hard for him to lose the weight, even though he tried. And he understood that the weight he came in was a bit too high for him. And also, he says that with all due respect to Hermes, he was not as motivated or mobilized in his head like he was with the match with maybe Chaffee or Lallatin.
SPEAKER_00: he wasn't as motivated for this match he felt so and also the the situation at the venue not having enough oxygen to breathe and he says that the same issue of course was for the Hermes too and for the other participants so overall there were several factors that played the role but okay first of all
SPEAKER_04: Why did he not have motivation as before? Is it because he was too dominant and people were thinking that you know like nobody can touch him or what was the reason for like not being motivated?
SPEAKER_01: I don't think Nermez's motivation was that he wanted to do something, that he wanted to do something. I think he was very happy to hear that he had some kind of motivation. Of course, I agree, but I don't think it was that he wanted to do something with Larratt. I think it was about 50 percent.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe it's because I've been doing this for a long time, and I realized that in fact, it's not like that. In fact, I don't talk much, and I don't do trash talk or anything like that. In fact, I don't talk much, and I don't do trash talk or anything like that. In fact, I don't talk much, and I don't do trash talk or anything like that.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's saying that, of course, the motivation and having no enemy feelings towards Ermes played the role. He always looks at Ermes as a friend and he didn't have the anger or some personal negative feelings about the match.
SPEAKER_00: That's why even before the match he was trying to artificially wound him up to become angrier, more motivated. Like he was maybe before the Larratt match, maybe now he had something like 20% of the same anger or anger within him to go through to the match.
SPEAKER_00: he thinks that that that also played the role and he always considered Hermes as friend and maybe one of the reasons could be that they didn't have any uh like artificial trash talk or some uh some some talk before the match so uh the the he went with the friendly environment within the match yeah one thing yeah
SPEAKER_01: Is he more motivated now against Morozov than he was?
SPEAKER_01: In that way, I came out, and in that way, I became a part of it. Because I was motivated to work with you. I was motivated to work with you. I was motivated to work with you. I was motivated to work with you. I was motivated to work with you. I was motivated to work with you.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's much more motivated now. He's basically unhappy with himself that he didn't bring the 100% to the table. And that anger towards himself is what drives him much stronger now. He thinks that, yeah, Morozov is a great opponent, but he's still far from the number one in the world.
SPEAKER_04: uh he's uh much more motivated now okay but so it's more about himself yes not about models yes yes okay this like like so we can say that after his last experience he like it was really a good experience that he doesn't need that kind of
SPEAKER_04: I mean he can't need you understand that kind of anger to win like because okay you didn't make me angry so I'm not motivated you understand it like he like did he finally like learn that like he should be he should find a way to motivate himself without being angered by his opponent you understand by being made anger angry.
SPEAKER_01: Although it is true that there will be such a situation, because it is possible to say that what is being expressed does not meet the motivation. Yes, it is true, it is true, but I don't think it's the case anymore. And I would like to say that this is not the case. I think it's a good idea to say that this is not the case, because
SPEAKER_01: In reality, in this situation and in the current one, there are some psychological problems, because, let's say, when you meet a lot of people, and in front of everyone you say that you are the number one and that you are not the only one, that you are not the only one, that you are not the only one, and all these materials, let's say,
SPEAKER_00: He says that it was a great experience for him. And this is not the first time that such thing has happened to him. And he thinks that overall, it was very beneficial. Because when you stumble, when you re-evaluate, you get more motivated.
SPEAKER_00: And overall, he had a long domination streak. And for a long time, the people were saying that there was no point for him to fight. And that, of course, time after time can make you more relaxed. And such experience, he thinks that overall is a great thing to have to keep yourself on track. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But also, it is like he says that he had a motivation problem and some other things like not enough oxygen and weight gain. But still, can you say that his opponent was also a very strong one and he deserves respect?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, of course, Hermes is very strong. And the fact that he brought such a shape to the match, that's what made the problems apparent. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And does Lewand think that if he ever, in my opinion, if he ever faces Hermes, Hermes will be probably stronger than last time. But does Lewand think that after this experience, he will probably be stronger than last time as well? What do you think, Hermes? What do you think about Hermes? What do you think about him?
SPEAKER_01: It is possible that it will be in the shape of a bird. It is possible that it will be in the shape of a bird
SPEAKER_00: He's sure that he will be in much better shape, definitely. He's already in a better shape than he was before the match. And he's sure that he will improve. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Levan, people often complain that you don't pull very often. And then
SPEAKER_00: When we set a match for you, then the same, we're the same people, bitches about, oh, this guy is mismatched and this, what do you think about this? Zoghi, first of all, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I would also like to ask you, what do you think about this match?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: You can't make everyone happy. There are always some haters that will criticize any step you take. Even if I had a match every week, then they would say, why so often?
SPEAKER_04: There was a time when Levan had matches every month and now he has a luxury and experience so that he can have the match whenever he deserves. Yeah, I mean, this very like same guy bitch about the same thing when when Hermes was set and they were saying Hermes needs one more year. Why you said so early? He didn't have to win, but he changed something.
SPEAKER_04: he at least showed that Levan is an incredibly strong human being, but still human being, not from Mars or something, you know. But, like, if he don't said anything, you know, how do you know? Like, whenever I said Morozov versus Dave Sheffield, the same exact people. They said, it's a mismatch and this and this. You said Ermes with Levan, they said the same thing after the match.
SPEAKER_04: The same people saying Hermes won the match or something, they're just like, because he didn't pull the last two rounds. They say, and then, I mean, even Hermes himself left it. Of course, it was 4-2. Of course, he won last two rounds. But to say that he won, it was just like comical. Even Hermes himself left the body, you know. But Hermes also proved that he is also a very, very strong guy.
SPEAKER_04: Levan, do you think that Ermes is the number two guy in the world? Looking at the results, it's apparent that Ermes is number two. What he's saying that if we don't include opinions, but just look at what is proven, then Ermes is number two.
SPEAKER_01: Not only because of all those rounds that he troubled Levan, but also his win against Dave Chaffee, 3-0, was a dream.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. He's saying that Gasparini versus Devon Larratt would also be a good match. He sees that Devon is also a contender for the spot. So that would be an interesting match to have. I was about to ask that, actually. Yeah, yeah. Levon, when I said this,
SPEAKER_04: Hermes disagree. But the round one, when you went totally outside top roll against Devon, your wrist and Devon's wrist, they both were like flat. Like neither of you really lost the wrist, but neither of you had the really wrist either. So it was just like flat wrist versus flat wrist. But when you hit Hermes, you took Hermes' wrist.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not saying that this would mean anything about their match, but only about this risk part. Do you think that Devon has maybe a slightly stronger risk than Hermes, or no? In the first round with Devon, you played very well. But your match and Devon's match were a bit different. What was the difference? Devon did not play very well in the match.
SPEAKER_01: In the first round of Hermes, Maja didn't play well against Devon. How do you think, when Maja played, did Devon play well against him? Well, Hermes, in fact, had a strong imposition and played well against him. Devon, in fact, had a strong imposition and played well against him.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it's a bad thing. I think that Larratt was involved in the police, and the police were very close to him, and it was not a bad thing. I think it's a good thing that he was involved in the police. I think that Larratt was involved in the police. I think it's a good thing that he was involved in the police.
SPEAKER_00: It's hard to compare the risks exactly between the two, because the way they defended themselves in the first round was quite different. Devon went much more outside.
SPEAKER_00: so he didn't have to protect that wrist for a long time. And if the first round has gone for a long time, he's sure that he would have taken the Devon's wrist also. And the way Hermes stood in the position was slightly different. And overall, he feels that it wasn't hard for him to take the wrist of Hermes. And it's hard to compare exactly between the two.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe it was because Devon's wrist compared to his arm, maybe it's stronger that, you know, his arm opens without risk, even while maybe Hermes has so strong arm that, you know, he holds on and then he loses the wrist, but the arm holds on. Maybe, you know, you know what's my point or not? Yep. The conclusion would be that Hermes was not willing to accept the challenge.
SPEAKER_01: In your opinion, it is possible to continue with Shedarev, but it is still a long way to go. Yes, it is possible. As far as I'm concerned, I don't think it's possible to continue with Shedarev.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: he's saying that overall he's he's not very happy with hermes's wrist he it it wasn't too troublesome uh to take the wrist and uh overall he was preparing uh for a top roll and to take his wrist that was his strategy uh going in uh yeah and and he did not feel too much effort in doing that yeah i think in my opinion you know like not here but maybe here level one little bit heads you know
SPEAKER_01: Maybe he should to control the pronator. He went fully pronated and hanging that way. And then he stayed and he come back. He had covered his wrist and then he pinned him. Yeah, I can tell you what I think. The problem is that he had a lot of pressure on his knee and his biceps.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, it's a very big problem. And the problem is that we have a lot of people, we have a lot of groups, and that's why we have a lot of problems. We have a lot of problems because we have a lot of people, we have a lot of groups, and that's why we have a lot of problems. If we have a lot of people, we have a lot of problems, and that's why we have a lot of problems.
SPEAKER_01: He fully agrees with your statement and he even thought the same during the match.
SPEAKER_00: But the trouble is that even before the match, his biceps were 62 centimeters in circumference. Yeah, and even probably 65 on the pump during the match. The size of his hand really played a bad role here because it opened up his angles.
SPEAKER_00: And he didn't feel as tight as he should be. So that's why he also advises others that the very big arm can be troublesome in keeping the angles tight. And that's why he had to fight in that position that he was doing. That's because he couldn't keep the angles as small as he would like.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but he was not really on his bicep. He was over-pronated out like this. He was more like on brachioradialis, not like this bicep, but here. For me, the problem is not with Levan's, it's more like Hermes' resistance. In my opinion, if Levan could just have a little bit more control here and
SPEAKER_04: If he could go a little bit sideways, I think Hermes' arm was so strong and Bruneder was so strong. One round, he tried to hit sideways and then Hermes' arm actually blocked. So it was normal that, you know, Levan only went outside. I think Levan chose the right strategy. But in my opinion, if he had a little bit more, his wrist was okay. His wrist didn't go back. Two more Stantim. Two more Stantim here.
SPEAKER_01: It would be like this. It would be like this.
SPEAKER_01: Actually, the same advice he got from Irakli during the match.
SPEAKER_00: and he understands that that's a good advice. But at that point... It was too late. Yeah. He had to have it in preparation. Yeah. Starving of oxygen and being tired, it was really hard to keep the mind and decision straight. That's why the last two rounds he tried to finish quickly.
SPEAKER_04: that was the only way that he could. I will ask one more thing, you know, this is Levon Saginashvili. Levon Saginashvili, in my opinion, until it's proven differently, the strongest armistice I've ever lived, in my opinion. People may think different, but majority of the people think this way. So it is not my place, but I also, like, I really want to talk with him about this. Whenever I watched round three, the first time he stuck,
SPEAKER_04: he tried to hold on and try to catch him you know without the strap you know and then two starts like this he tried i was like i was like the one is mistaken he's he's tired in his hand without the strap you know like and then in this step he he was stopped do you think that that try to start so to try because one was like
SPEAKER_04: The second is still like this, and then he went to strap. So those two really trying to hold on. Does he think that a little bit tiredly sent before the strap?
SPEAKER_00: And you said that the problem is that you are in the middle of a crisis and you need to save your energy. What is your role in this? Well, you know, when energy is lost, there is no way to solve this problem.
SPEAKER_01: Even if you have an energy problem, you don't have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about it.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it's a bad idea. I don't think it's a bad idea. I don't think it's a bad idea. I don't think it's a bad idea. I don't think it's a bad idea. I don't think it's a bad idea.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's saying that he didn't lack the power or energy during the match. It was more of a he prepared the wrist the best he could.
SPEAKER_00: He expected a stronger wrist from Aramis and a stronger top roll. And the way the match went was a bit unexpected for him. And the catch that he's trying to do before the strap, that's the usual way he pulls. No, no. First two rounds, he was like, boom, boom. And the third round, he was trying to hold on. Aramis was like this. He was, you know, it kind of takes some...
SPEAKER_00: He says that Ermes had the strength to run away in the first two rounds and in third not as much. So that's why the slip was slower. Yeah, he said not as much, but he again was successful and it was longer.
SPEAKER_03: It was longer to get that. Yeah. Anyways, Hans, any more questions? Do you have any questions, Hans? Well, not about this match, but of course, I got other questions. For example, I want to ask about his wrist injury in the left hand. How is it going? Does he plan to compete on the left hand? Anytime soon, at least.
SPEAKER_01: At the beginning of the year, there was a normal number of people, but now there are a lot of people, and I think there will be a lot of problems in the future. Yes, that's right. Yes, that's right. Yes, that's right. Yes, that's right. Yes, that's right.
SPEAKER_01: He still trains his left. Even today he had an exercise on the left and he's happy with the wrist. It's doing all right.
SPEAKER_00: But the wrist is not the only thing. He also has a left shoulder injury from a long time ago. So he's training the left, but he doesn't prioritize it and doesn't plan to. Doesn't plan to compete? Yeah, he doesn't plan to compete. Oh, that's bad.
SPEAKER_01: You can do it all at once. You can't do it all at once. You can't do it all at once. You can't do it all at once. You can't do it all at once.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's saying that his left is good for one round. And for that first one round, it may be strong. It may be stronger than anybody else's. But on the second or third pull, probably it's a tendon issue. He just can't keep the strength going for long enough.
SPEAKER_04: I have another one. See, he usually not sure if he underestimates, but he doesn't see anyone serious enough to be at his level until this Hermes match. And Hermes proved it, you know.
SPEAKER_04: he can be a serious threat. So does he think that he has little bit underestimating issues, his opponents, or this is the way he motivates himself, or he really thinks that nobody is close? How is it?
SPEAKER_01: How do you think, is there a new solution to this? Do you think there will be a factor of self-reliance? What can I say? If you think about how it will be in the future, if you think about how it will be in the future, if you think about how it will be in the future, if you think about how it will be in the future
SPEAKER_01: There are a lot of things that can be done. I would like to say that there is a lot of new things. There is no such thing as euthanasia, but in that regard, if I were to say,
SPEAKER_00: He's saying that there are a lot of very strong opponents and he definitely sees that their level is high. He thinks that if his preparation is perfect,
SPEAKER_00: If he can work and put everything into the preparation, there's no one that can win. But he also understands that if he relaxes too much, if he has a slip, if he's a bit too much relaxed, he can see that he can't do that. Yeah, he can't do that, and they are not that far away. Yeah. There is a support that's furiously asking,
SPEAKER_04: Who, whose hand and wrist was the strongest Levan ever faced in all his matches? Who, whose hand and wrist was the strongest in his professional career that he ever faced? Can you tell us about your career? What did you do in the European Championship in 2016?
SPEAKER_01: And I don't think it's a good idea to do it now. I think it's a good idea to do it now. I don't think it's a good idea to do it now. I think it's a good idea to do it now.
SPEAKER_01: In his history of matches, 2016, Krasimir Konstantinov, his wrist comes to mind.
SPEAKER_00: That match he lost on falls, but he remembers that he just couldn't take his wrist on the top roll. On the later matches, he understood better how to approach him and he fought with the bicep. But to his memory, that was the strongest wrist that he felt in the Supermatch. I wonder, has he ever...
SPEAKER_00: Even compared to those super heavyweights that he faced recently?
SPEAKER_00: In terms of wrist, he would say yes. With the later opponents, he didn't have any trouble with taking the wrist. And yeah, to his memory... What is his power right now compared to 2016?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, of course, it was interesting to see what was going on. Of course, it was interesting to see what was going on. Of course, it was interesting to see what was going on. Of course, it was interesting to see what was going on. Of course, it was interesting to see what was going on.
SPEAKER_00: Of course, he understands that his level is also different. But that's what he experienced. Yeah, that's his experience. And also from the Lallatin's match, of course, there was some fight in the first round and everybody was saying that it would be impossible to top roll Lallatin with his long levers.
SPEAKER_04: Uh, but, uh, he still managed to do it. Yeah. Yeah. But we need to also mention, I was right there. Kostadino was only 102 kilo and he pulled a super weight. He pulled a super weight. Kostadino in his prime was also incredible strong. Yeah. There is another super chat. Devon's classy finger. I am so hyped to see the event live in Istanbul today. We booked two flights and the hotel.
SPEAKER_03: Devan's classy finger says this. And let's talk. Do you have any question, Kaan? Yeah, yeah. I was just about that topic. I was wondering around those times, has he ever pulled or maybe an after pull, not official, Pushkar's hand? Pushkar is...
SPEAKER_01: Do you think you will be able to compete in the World Championship? I will be able to compete in the World Championship in Turkey in March 2020. I will be able to compete in the World Championship in Turkey in March 2020.
SPEAKER_01: I had no idea what I was going to do. I had no idea what I was going to do. I had no idea what I was going to do. I had no idea what I was going to do.
SPEAKER_01: He remembers he met Pushkar in 2018 on the World Championship in Turkey.
SPEAKER_00: Pushkar helped him to warm up before the match. And he remembers that, of course, they didn't pull the full force, but his hand was very impressive. He felt really, really strong. Pushkar gave him some advice on how to fight in a tournament. Yeah, and overall, he felt that he was really strong. And unfortunately, soon after that, he passed.
SPEAKER_04: He felt that he was really strong. Yeah. And I want to, okay, another subject. When I asked Levan about Morozov versus Rewaz, and he was, as far as I remember, sure that Rewaz was going to beat Morozov. But Morozov won. And when I chat with Morozov,
SPEAKER_04: last week, and he said he is now 20 or 25% stronger. We need to remember that Morozov last year pulled every East versus West event, every two and a half months, three months he pulled. And the guy is very young, very young, and he's growing. And he said he is now 20, like if he was 100 against Revas, now he's 120, 25.
SPEAKER_04: And I said, how much better you can get? And he said, he will be maybe 150, 160. So I don't know if it is possible or not. But if you think that 50% stronger Morozov, the time that he beats Revas, does he see Morozov as a possible threat? Or not at all? Like he thinks that, you know, like a relaxed mode, you know, like,
SPEAKER_00: And I just come and beat him, you know, like, or he takes him seriously. Thank you very much for your time, Morozov. I would like to ask you one more question, and I know that you have a lot to say. Do you have any serious concerns or do you want to say something? No, I don't have any serious concerns.
SPEAKER_01: I'm very sorry. Because it's been a very long time since I've been here. I don't want to say that I don't have any regrets. I don't want to say that I'm sorry. I just want to say that I'm happy. I'm very happy that I'm here. I'm very motivated.
SPEAKER_01: I would like to thank you for all your contributions to my work. I would like to thank you for all your contributions. I would like to thank you for all your contributions. I would like to thank you for all your contributions. I would like to thank you for all your contributions. I would like to thank you for all your contributions. I would like to thank you for all your contributions.
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that Morozov is really strong. He doesn't underestimate him. As a personal advice, he would say to him not to gain weight quickly.
SPEAKER_00: From his personal experience, that's not always a good thing. It's always better to gain the weight slowly and to adapt. From his perspective, he's very motivated. He's happy with the last victory, but not with his performance. So he will make sure that the future two months he will be living in the gym and he will make his fans happy and
SPEAKER_04: Even if it's hard to do, he will surprise everyone. So he's saying that he's taking Morozov very seriously and he needs to take this seriously so that there won't be another health accident.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so. I don't think that Morozov is very likely to die, and I don't think he will die. I think that he will die, and I think that he will die. I don't think that he will die. I think that he will die. I don't think that he will die.
SPEAKER_01: In all these situations, I think it is very important to have such a relationship, because if you are a sportsman of your age, who has a job,
SPEAKER_00: He's very motivated. He's going for the fight. He's not going in there relaxed. He takes this match very seriously. And he will bring the best version. And he won't be overconfident or thinking,
SPEAKER_00: Am I number one or number 100 in the world? I don't care about that. I'm going there for the fight. I don't expect Morozov to be an easy opponent or to surrender easily. But he believes that he will win because he will be coming there 100%. Yes, I will win.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I understand. I understand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's a first match in a while that he's thirsty for a battle. He's thirsty for the war.
SPEAKER_00: He really wants this match and really is looking forward to it. And he will bring the best. I understand. And who, like, we ask all the time, but okay, number one is Levan Prun and Hermes, number two, mostly Prun, you know, we all agree.
SPEAKER_04: And who is the, like, Devon thinks that number three in the world is Dennis. Do you agree with that as an opinion? Because as proven, he didn't pull anyone from top 10. John is incredible, but for probably at this age for his weight category. But for the open class, I don't think John is in top 10. So Dennis beat John. So we cannot say that he proved. It's not proven.
SPEAKER_04: Officially, there are practice schools. But as an opinion, may Deniz be there? Number three, number four, number five? Is it possible? Can you ask him? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, your opinion is correct, Deniz. I'm not interested in Deniz.
SPEAKER_01: No. 2, No. 20, and No. 1000. I want to tell you that in the future, you will meet me. You will be with me. I will be with you and you will be with me. This is the first time you have seen me.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, no matter if Denis is number three or number 20 now in the world, the match he wants to pull with Denis and he thinks that's unavoidable.
SPEAKER_00: But not now, right? Because the guy is still thinking. Yes, yes. Whenever he wants. Whenever he's ready, yeah. Whenever, yeah, whenever he's ready. Yeah, yeah. He thinks that, yeah, Denis has been rooting for his opponents
SPEAKER_00: starting from trubin to devon now he's preparing morozov uh he thinks that he should uh stop avoiding levan and uh that they should fall whenever he wants uh he's ready i don't i don't think he's avoiding levan i think he just needs to get ready you know whenever he's ready i think that's his main goal i don't think he's avoiding that that is why he is training he's training but
SPEAKER_04: He's not going to pull Levan when he's not ready. He's going to pull him when he's ready. And in October, in East versus West, he has a match with Devon Larratt. Can you ask him who's winning that match? He thinks that Devon will win. Oh, Devon will beat Denis. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. He will even record a personal video for Devin. Oh, okay. Okay. It's personal. Yeah. Yeah. That's when he found out that, uh, Dennis was a big fan of Devin. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: People from chat said that, John said that Dennis is far from Devon. Of course, my friend, this is a few months of serious training. Like, he will have another seven, eight more months, you know. When he has 20% more, then the things will change, you know. Like, and this guy, Kenneth, I don't think he's anywhere near his prime, you know. He will be getting stronger. He's just getting into the mode of competing.
SPEAKER_04: Uh, yeah, yeah. I see that. I see that that kind of, uh, that like pressure between, you know, Levan side and Dennis side, you know, I can, I can see that. And then even when I did the poll, who is the strongest arm wrestler in the history. And then he was number one was Levan and number two was Dennis, you know, so eventually it's gonna happen, but it needs to happen whenever both athletes are ready.
SPEAKER_04: yes so no excuse already he's coming for 11 i think his aim is to be number one again it's normal it's normal but that is not only the only about being number one of today there is i think that is to talk about who is the strongest ever subject and also there is one more subject i don't want to mention again
SPEAKER_01: He has a question. How many times has Tsiplenkov been world and Europe champion? He never competed. He only competed professionally. Then how can we consider him to be number one?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but Jon Astor has only one left arm, one title. Like, is he not the ghost? Like, the arm wrestling, the WAF, WAF is the toughest competition in the world. And it's a doping test.
SPEAKER_00: Levan is saying that I was number one in the WAF and number one in the Supermatches also. So comparing between us two, I think the answer is clear. No, no, no, I'm not doing that. I just look at it because there are many, like if we talk about WAF, until 90 kilos,
SPEAKER_04: The WAF champions are untouchable. But over WAF, you know, over 100 kilo, 90 kilo, WAF champions has not been always the best. Pushkar was winning WAF and Dennis was beating Pushkar. So that WAF is very important for me, but it doesn't prove. My judgment doesn't work that way. But I already said Levan, in my opinion, is the strongest, in my opinion. So I don't have any disagreements.
SPEAKER_04: But I'm only trying to say that it doesn't mean that like when you are winning the WAF, trust me, from 55 kilo to 90 kilo, winning WAF, nobody can touch you. There is nobody that can say, if I go to WAF, I would be the WAF champions. There is nothing like that. It doesn't exist. But when you go 100, 110, over 110, like because professional armwrestling, like more,
SPEAKER_04: but has more to offer to these guys. So many of these guys choose professional because WAF is an amateur event and not every country, like some of our countries, they pay money when you win WAF. So they just choose professional event. Like Devon never won WAF, but he beat Sanderis, who won the WAF a few months ago. He didn't only beat him, he was very dominant. He beat Rudnik.
SPEAKER_01: with WAF champion many times, you understand? Like, like your dad's son.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he of course agrees that the WF level is not always the same and maybe used to be a higher level before.
SPEAKER_00: and now since some countries are not competing. And speaking of Pushkar versus Deniz example, we also need to consider that the Pushkar's competitions on Europe and World Championships, it was tested. It's hard to compare between the two. Yeah, yeah, I understand. But when they meet, it wasn't tested. .
SPEAKER_01: Considering that I have to, from Pushkar's standpoint, to have to compete with Denis and then after that, three, four months away is the championship.
SPEAKER_00: I understand. Where he will be tested, of course, the preparation will not be the same. Yeah, I understand. So, he thinks that Denis did improve himself? Robert-Pikrov, Denis are down to get a beta, which would be really well. Denis, I think he is down to get a beta.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think Zlotirov is dead? Yes. Of course, he was killed in the 4th or 5th war with the Bolsheviks. He was killed in the 4th or 5th war with the Germans. He was killed in the 4th or 5th war with the Germans. He was killed in the 4th war with the Germans.
SPEAKER_01: He was a very important person to me, and I was very happy to meet him. I was very happy to meet him. I was very happy to meet him. I was very happy to meet him. I was very happy to meet him. I was very happy to meet him. I was very happy to meet him. I was very happy to meet him. I was very happy to meet him.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, Dennis was very strong, but there are plenty of example matches. For example, with Michael Todd, a 4-2.
SPEAKER_04: his loss with John Prezanc, his troubles with 100kg Liliev. Yeah, but when he traveled with Liliev, he had a long match with Pushkar. And when he lost against John, it was his first year. Also, can you tell him, from Zlotitur, usually November, till the European Championships, usually May, there wasn't like three months, there was like six months. And at that time,
SPEAKER_00: When Pushkar was still competing, those six months was plenty of time. Yeah, he thinks that the fact that he was tired from Pushkar, that's not an excuse. That's the tournament. So that's part of the game. That's not an excuse for being tired.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. You know what I'm just saying? A push car pull is low to true. And the next test they went was European Championship six, seven months later. I don't want to go there, but if it was a private competition, I mean, a private conversation, I would just talk more. But let's forget about it. There is a super chat. Silky Wookie, if Devon wins against Gennady, do you think that it shows that he can beat Dennis as well?
SPEAKER_04: And of course, this is, he already said that, you know, Devon is going to beat Denis. But I don't know, let's ask him, since this is, thank you for your superficial humility. He said that if Devon beats Gennady, that would automatically mean that he's going to beat Denis as well. If Devon beats Gennady, it doesn't mean that Denis will beat him.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, Tunisia is very important to me. I can't say for sure, but I can say for sure that it is very important for me to be in contact with Iraq, and it is very important for me to be in contact with them.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, in reality, I was very happy to hear that, and I was very happy for myself, and no matter how hard I tried, no matter how hard I tried, I was very happy to hear that, and no matter how hard I tried, I was very happy to hear that, and no matter how hard I tried, I was very happy to hear that, and no matter how hard I tried, I was very happy to hear that, and no matter how hard I tried, I was very happy to hear that, and no matter how hard I tried,
SPEAKER_01: It's really hard to estimate tennis's current level. The match with John
SPEAKER_00: even though impressive, it's not a good indicator because John had a recent match with Irakli and he prepared whatever he could for the Dennis match. And to be honest, Levan doesn't see what was the reasoning for John to do that way. And he thinks that, yeah, it's hard to estimate the current level of Dennis. As for them,
SPEAKER_04: match between devon and gennady he's sure that it will be a long and hard battle one second one second we will go there we will go there we will quickly go there and we don't want to take so much time of uh levan and levan i want you to come and watch your brother iraqis world title match in istanbul okay
SPEAKER_04: Okay, yeah. Levan, my friend, I have huge respect for you. Somebody just said that why Engin doesn't say Levan is the best ever?
SPEAKER_01: but the strongest ever. I mean the same. No, no, no. What's that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah he he doesn't he does not like the to be called the the the the greatest of all time he thinks that the title would not be correct uh especially since uh uh john is around it wouldn't be
SPEAKER_04: uh he won't feel comfortable no no i said strongest ever yeah he is in fact he is strongest ever and he is the best ever like in my opinion in the history of our nursing it could be everyone but it doesn't necessarily make you the goat you understand when when john is like 90 kilo 95 kilo many years he beat even the super heavy weights so 40 years so that's why he's the goat but for sure levan is the
SPEAKER_04: like strongest and the best he would be anyone in the earth on the earth in my opinion some people may say this is this guy or that guy i don't know this is my opinion so i just also also i want him to know that whenever i discuss with him he is my guest
SPEAKER_04: I can only ask him a question, but as a friend, I also share my thoughts, opinions with him. I hope he doesn't get like offended that I say my opinion as well. I'm not an advocate of this guy or that guy. I just say my opinions so that we can have the conversation, can have more, you know, interesting. But like, do I upset him when I share my opinion or?
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no. He's saying that he fully agrees and he would not consider himself to be the goat. No, no, I'm not talking about the goat subject. I'm talking about earlier subjects, yeah, earlier subjects that, you know, like... I want to say something strong. In the beginning, I didn't know what to say to Denis, because, as you know, he was very, very strong.
SPEAKER_01: And I wanted to talk to you about it and explain it to you. Because, as you know, Zala, I think,
SPEAKER_01: When I was a child, I used to go to the cinema when I was very young. Now, we can't do that, and the media can't do that either. Some people say that there is no job in the future, because there is a series of movies about their life, and some people say that the cinema is not working. But what is very interesting is that
SPEAKER_00: He agrees with the title and to be the strongest armwrestler in the world, he's ready to defend this title. That's why he also wants to have a match with Denis. He agrees that that would resolve any question of who's the strongest of all time.
SPEAKER_00: uh so uh yeah in terms of strictly speaking of strength uh he agrees and uh he wants to to prove prove the point i want to ask something does he agree that dennis is the second strongest the closest person to him from the past uh
SPEAKER_01: First of all, I don't think it's a good idea to do it in the morning, because it's not a good idea to do it in the morning, if you want to do it in the evening. Then, with this technique, if you want to do it in the morning, I think it's better to do it in the evening.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he think with the results, he thinks that he's number one. But strictly speaking of strength, he think he really wants to have the match and to compare the strength against the strength.
SPEAKER_00: um yeah yeah he wishes for the dennis uh to be uh in his prime strength and health and to meet that exact version uh because it in terms of strictly strength that would be an interesting match for him
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that by results he is number one, but in terms of role strength, there are still questions to be answered. And that's why he wants to meet the prime version Dennis. Okay, let's do some super matches and then we finish. I will ask, probably he doesn't know Douglas, but do you know Douglas, Doug Erich?
SPEAKER_04: He pulled Coach Ray last event, the first match, American guy. No, no, no, that's not. Well, I think.
SPEAKER_03: The three great hook pullers in this next event are a little bit in trouble. Sasho, Prokopchik and Samushya, because they all face big guys. Very big guys. I mean, we may expect some surprises, maybe. Of course, I mean, Prokopchik is the favorite, I think. But there is a possibility for Douglas to win, huh? Yes, yes, yes. I didn't watch him so much, but...
SPEAKER_04: He looked like he is very, very, very good against the hook pullers. But I don't know. Prokopchuk's bicep is almost a lock. OK, who do you think is going to win? You're saying that Prokopchuk is the favorite? Yes, yes, of course. OK, I understand, yeah. OK, can you ask him, Levan, Alizan Muradov versus Cody Merritt, left arm? Muradov and Cody Merritt are the same, Mr. Speaker.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he's not sure. Yeah, he's not sure. He's going to watch it, especially on the left. He's not sure. He's not sure. Many people think that Ali Can is favorite, but Cody Meredith is super heavyweight. Why is he not sure? What does he think about this match? Even no prediction?
SPEAKER_00: What do you think? Murad Ovi from Suboq is there, but does he have the power to win? I think he has a lot of power. Yeah, his current shape seems to be the stronger at the moment. And can you ask him Rob Vigent versus Zurab? Arvijay, do you know Zurab? I don't know Zurab, I don't know him.
SPEAKER_01: Zura will definitely win. Especially looking at his current shape, he's basically a Georgian Tsiplenko. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I will ask him, okay, this one, Macho Saginashvili, Adam Morzensky.
SPEAKER_01: Sagina Shvili always wins. But do you know Adam? Yes, yes. You told me with Bozhidar, right? Bozhidar match.
SPEAKER_00: He really liked Adam's performance, his last match. He was really impressed with his technique and he was pleasantly impressed. Yeah, but like Levan, Adam, Bacho is very young.
SPEAKER_04: He's not super experienced. What makes you think that he's going to win this match? How is he going to win? Is he a freak? Is he a special human being? Or what is special with this guy? I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: He's definitely a freak for armwrestling. At that age, I think he's even more freak than I was. How tall is he, Macho?
SPEAKER_01: He's so young that on the match he will be even taller.
SPEAKER_04: probably well oh because oh okay yeah i understand yes he's really yeah yeah and there is jr williams thank you for your support what will levan's competition weight be in his upcoming match with morozov he answered this but thank you for your super chat can you again ask him because the super chat he probably joined later
SPEAKER_04: From 170 to 175 kg. Yeah, between that range. Yes. Okay. And Khan, our guest, my friend, what do you think about Laletin versus Tobias match with left arm?
SPEAKER_03: Well, Laletin said that he's very close to his best in the left arm. So I have no other choice other than Laletin. He's going to win probably. But of course, style-wise, high top roll, low hand top roll. Of course, Laletin's fingers are so strong. But I don't know. Really, I want to see that match. But of course, the favorite is Laletin for me.
SPEAKER_04: Levan, because you know that this guy, Tobias, has very strong hand, very strong, especially his left arm is very strong. When Morozov tried to top roll him, he easily took Morozov's wrist, Tobias. And Morozov beat him in hook. But Laletin is pulling this way. Do you think there is a possibility, Tobias, to surprise Laletin or no, in your opinion? Oh, no.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think is the best way to do it? Because you have a good body. I have been doing this for a long time. I have been doing it for many years. I have been doing it for a long time, but I think it depends on the person. If you want to do it, you have to do it. If you want to do it, you have to do it.
SPEAKER_00: uh le latin's left is really strong maybe even stronger than the right uh although uh tobias left is also good but he still thinks that le latin will win maybe if tobias can hook him maybe there is a chance for a fight but other than that not with top roll not with top roll yeah i saw in probably what
SPEAKER_04: Maybe four or five years ago at the WAF World Championships, Levan, Deserano beat Laletin with left arm and Laletin win with right arm. Do you remember in 110 kg? Deserano beat him easy.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it's not that I don't like Laletin, I don't like him, I don't like him, I don't like him, I don't like him, I don't like him, I don't like him, I don't like him, I don't like him, I don't like him, I don't like him, I don't like him, I don't like him.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe psychologically, Lletin, considering his latest defeat, might not be ready. But if he's mentally feeling good and in shape, he should win. I understand. Levan Arif versus Di Zerano, Jorgi Di Zerano. Arif Ertemi, Di Zerano.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, there is. In fact, this is what the Institute of School of Science and Technology says. There is no such thing as a chance of success. There is no such thing as a chance of success in the future. There is no such thing as a chance of success. There is no such thing as a chance of success in the future.
SPEAKER_01: In hook, Arif is very strong. Probably not many can win him with the hook.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's really hard to defeat him with a hook. If Tiranov manages to troll Arif, then there's a chance for a battle. Arif doesn't actually hook, but Arif opens up. Whoever tries to hook Arif,
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah yeah whenever you try to hook him he just boom directly yeah yeah yeah go ahead uh that's why he advises not to go in hook with arif but try to top roll oh okay so but how do you see that who is winning who has the chance or close someone's percentage 60 to rf oh
SPEAKER_03: And can you? I think 65% of course. I don't know how, how, uh, how strong Zerano's top role is right now, but other than top role, I don't think he has another chance. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Also considering that Arif is at home, it will also mean that he will be better. Yep. There will be sports, huh? Yeah, yeah. Okay, let's move. Brandon Elsessor versus Samushka Levan. Elsessor Samushka. Samushka robot, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Samusha is a robot. He's in great shape now and I'm sure he will win. Question. Can anybody on this earth beat David Samusha under 85 kilo? Yeah, he doubts it.
SPEAKER_01: Does he think that guys like Tautiev or Haji Murad Zolev have a chance? Not now. Even if Zolev goes down, he can now beat Samushchev. No, no, no. If Zaloyev goes down, it's possible.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, now, yeah, he thinks that Zolaev wouldn't win. If he devotes time and prepares and brings his best shape, maybe there's a fight. But today, he thinks that Samushin is the best. I understand. Yeah. And tell him that some old wolves are training also for that category.
SPEAKER_01: I see. So, you are one of the best players in this category. Yes, I have played with Ulus Dambabayevi and Drava Mirceba. I think he is a very good guard. I am very proud of him. I am interested to see what new players will come out of him.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he saw Babaev a couple of days ago and his injury is doing better. He really wants to be back to the competition. And overall, Levan really is looking forward to this old league coming back and would like to also know if Liliev is planning to do so. I understand, yeah. Okay, then let's go to last probably three matches.
SPEAKER_01: One is Dave Chaffee versus Rehwaz Lutidze. Rehwaz is in a different form. You know, he is a very good player and a very good player. He is a very good player. Chaffee is a very good player.
SPEAKER_01: Looking at Rivas, he's in great shape and moving
SPEAKER_00: uh big weights at the moment uh we have not heard from chafee for a while and uh he thinks that that means that chafee is also preparing and in great shape and it's healthy yes personally of course he wants us to win but from the sports perspective he thinks it's 50 50 and table will tell
SPEAKER_04: You know, there is one guy, Sunshine. I don't have a beef with Blemen. Blemen is my good friend, and I have huge respect for him. So please don't write things that you don't know, please. That's the biggest problem in the community. Everyone just shares whatever they think is the fact, you know. You can have opinion, but just come on. Anyway, so let's go. First,
SPEAKER_01: I want to ask you, these last two matches, did you expect Irakli to lose his wrist and beat John like this?
SPEAKER_01: It's a very difficult question. I think that John has said many, many times that this is a very difficult question. It's a very difficult question. We all know that Iraq is a country that has a lot of women and a lot of women. And I think that a lot of women and men are involved in this.
SPEAKER_01: I think it will have a very strong impact on the economy, especially the economy of Iraq. As far as I know, in 2020, I think it will be possible in 2023-2022
SPEAKER_01: In preparation for John's match, we knew that the wrist would be the weak point for Irakli and we trained it a lot. It seems that it wasn't enough.
SPEAKER_00: And that match, Irakli fully won with his will of victory, with his spirit. On Gurbayev is very dangerous opponent, maybe even more dangerous than John today. And it will be a very hard battle. Personally, he wishes Irakli to win this match. From objective standpoint, maybe Khidir Ghali is a slight favorite. Wow, that's surprising to hear that.
SPEAKER_03: And Kaan, how do you think about this match? Well, I think Qadir Ghali is naturally bigger than Irakli frame-wise. What do you mean bigger? Because I think that was 186, Irakli is about 190. You mean the hand size? The hand size, the shoulders, the bones. I see, I mean, I look at both of them.
SPEAKER_03: I think naturally the guy and his joints are rock solid. If you stop the match in the center, I don't think he can outrun Ongarbaev. I mean, just like Levan, I think he's likely favorite in this match. Can you ask Levan if somehow he actually loses his wrist, does he think that
SPEAKER_04: It will be the same result that how it happened with John, or it will be harder to press Iraqli with dead wrists. He should not lose his wrist.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you very much. It was a pleasure. I think that in this regard, the psychology of the Iraqis, if you look at it from a psychological point of view, I think it's a bit of an underdog, a bit of a coward. Because in this situation, I think that you have to be very careful and be very careful.
SPEAKER_01: It is clear that there is a lot of history in Bulgaria, and there are such initiatives, which are very important. So, in general, I would like to say that I am very happy to be able to share this information with you. I am very happy to be able to share it with you.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, Ungarbaev is definitely more dangerous and it would be harder to press with the lost wrist in this case. You should understand that Ungarbaev has shown victories previously
SPEAKER_00: which were very impressive maybe the match with kurdecha and many others yes yes but iraqli will be fighting from the underdog position and he thinks that that will be even beneficial for him for preparation and for during the fight that he he will be able to show
SPEAKER_04: a better fight from such position. Yeah, I think this is very important for Irakli because this is like, like if he wins this match, he will be the best in the world in that category. And I think it's very, very important match because in that category, we have, we have many guys, many guys in Irakli will be ranking number one. There is one guy, he says, please reconsider live commentary. My friend, there is nothing to
SPEAKER_04: I just ask kindly. Some people said yes, they respect. Some people says they don't give a shit. So there is nothing to do. I mean, I don't have any authority to do anything to stop this. So what do you mean? I don't understand. And another guy, you really need to check your, I don't know, IQ level or something. Joe...
SPEAKER_04: If East versus West can't afford live commentary, it can't afford testing. My friend, what is it to afford live commentary? What do I need to spend? What's live commentary? Just to put two guys there or one guy there, he doesn't like commentary. What do you mean effort? This is a $200,000 event. What is it? Do you think that those guys who are doing the live commentary, they are affording something? They are spending like half a million dollars or something? My friend, what do you drink and eat?
SPEAKER_04: to make such stupid comments, you know, just come on, these people are really, they are, and they are like... You shouldn't worry this much because if Levan was reading all the comments, he would go mad. Yeah, but these people, they are like, how to say, it's like a disease, you know.
SPEAKER_04: that is just impacting, you know, just like going everywhere. You know, one guy says something and some they don't have. They just don't think, oh, yeah, yeah, he cannot afford. What is it to afford? You know, like, what's it what do I need to spend? You know, whatever. Anyway, so but guys, I hear that you you need a chat room. So I think that from official East versus West channel, we can do something that like
SPEAKER_04: Ruben Duran- Roman sg records, he can go with the camera you know, in the crowd talk with our tomorrow's or talk with the one and during there, you know that time you can you can check with each other, you know, and I think we can provide. Ruben Duran- That would be awesome really awesome. yeah.
SPEAKER_04: anyway so the last thing i'm asking and we're finishing sorry levan and i appreciate my friends i appreciate for your time thank you thank you brother thank you thank you are you always ready yeah yeah thank you thank you thank you um devon larat in ghana so you you almost answered this and i just stopped turning like this this is this is my dream much yeah
SPEAKER_01: As you can see from the Google search, this is a match between my father and my father-in-law. In the match between my father-in-law and my father-in-law, there was a match between my father-in-law and my father-in-law. There was a match between my father-in-law and my father-in-law.
SPEAKER_00: As an armwrestling fan, this is one of the dream matches for Devin and Gennady to meet. I'm very thankful for organizing this match. On par with other dream matches, like maybe Devin or Dennis, I'm really looking forward to this.
SPEAKER_04: And oh, listen, listen, that's not enough. Who is winning there? What's happening there? Listen, listen, Levan. Levan, Devon and Gennady was going very friendly. And then on the live program, I said, Devon says he's going to submit Gennady. He's going to make him, I give up. You understand? And I said, do you believe he's going to give up? He said, he will not say he give up.
SPEAKER_04: But Gennady will be like a cow with the four legs cutting and moving on the floor like this. And Gennady get angry and Gennady said that he will hit him so many times so hard that Devon is going to beg him to stop, stop, don't hit me more, you know.
SPEAKER_01: i wouldn't advise devon to make gennady angry uh on the contrary he he he should be friendly if he wants to win if he wants to have any chance if devon wants to have chance he shouldn't provoke
SPEAKER_04: This is what Gennady said. Gennady said now it's personal. But who is winning? Levan, who is winning? Still no prediction. Everyone is saying that Levan is winning. Because they say Gennady is not like you, explosive. And they say it will be endurance war. And they say if it is endurance war, they say Levan wins. But I really am curious about your opinion.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not saying that Devo was influenced by Gennady. I'm not saying that Devo was influenced by Gennady, because Gennady... I'm not saying that Gennady was influenced by Gennady, because Gennady... I'm not saying that Gennady was influenced by Gennady, because I'm not saying that Gennady was influenced by Gennady, because I'm not saying that Gennady was influenced by Gennady, because I'm not saying that Gennady was influenced by Gennady, because I'm not saying that Gennady was influenced by Gennady, because I'm not saying that Gennady was influenced by Gennady, because I'm not saying that Gennady was influenced by Gennady, because I'm not saying that Gennady was influenced by Gennady, because I'm not saying that Gennady was influenced by Gennady, because I'm not saying that Gennady was influenced by Gennady, because I'm not saying that Gennady was influenced by
SPEAKER_01: He thinks that endurance is the favorite game for Gennady.
SPEAKER_00: maybe even more favorite for him than for Devin. Wow. Yes. Wow. Just guys on the chat, did you hear that? And continue. Yes. And even on the table like you, of course, Devin is very smart, but Gennady can be even smarter. So he's really looking forward for a long and very great battle.
SPEAKER_01: And he sees like 50-50? Yeah, he overall, the victory-wise, . Yeah, I'm fully rooting for Gennady. But objectively, I have to say 50-50. OK. If you go a little bit technical,
SPEAKER_04: Devon has a very strong pronator. And how Gennady should pull? Can he control Devon's pronator, or Devon will take his risk and Gennady needs to pin him there? Or there is a possibility that Gennady can go outstrikes? RASUR CHEVO, GENNADY'S INTERPRONATOR, DZILIERIAK, LARATZI. GENNADY CHEVO, GENNADY'S INTERPRONATOR, DZILIERIAK, LARATZI.
SPEAKER_01: But I don't want to say that Larrate is not one of the authors of the book. In the end, I think that Gennady has written a very good book, which I don't want to say. Larrate is not one of the authors of the book, but Gennady has written a very good book. As I said, he is a great writer.
SPEAKER_01: If Devon,
SPEAKER_00: Wait, let me remember exactly. If Devin manages to take the wrist of Gennady, then Gennady will do a very strong hit, like he did with something like with Michael Todd. Gennady has a very strong hit and press, which Devin will not be expecting. And if they go into the hook, it will be...
SPEAKER_00: very tough day for devon and maybe even he will have to write gennady on his bicep too he will have to what he will have to tattoo gennady's name on his bicep too if they go oh oh yeah see so now devon and his friends uh poke shop
SPEAKER_04: they both pull against Georgians and they both had bicep injury. So this time, that one is coming for, you know, revenge. And let's see, I will be very, very, you know, it will be very interesting match. It will be very interesting match. Wow. I think we found the headliner.
SPEAKER_04: If Devin goes inside against Gennady, he will have another touch on his bicep. Listen, in the first round, fresh rounds, but later, Devin usually goes there after he exhausts his opponent. He goes in later round, but let's see how it will be. Yes. Can, do you have any opinion about this? Let's finish almost two hours.
SPEAKER_03: When you ask, I got excited so much. The match is outstanding. And I don't know, like, if Devon tries to go open top rope like he always does, I think he needs to be very careful because there's a thin line. If he opens up that much, you know, back in the day, he was even losing his pronator, but he was using his, like, rotator. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think he cannot hold his like bone line on the table. Yeah. Or maybe elbow on the pad. It's very difficult. Maybe he needs to play with the... Christo's mind a little bit, maybe tire Gennady out a little bit and then... Yeah, but Levan said that Gennady is also very good about endurance. That's what Levan said, yeah. But you know...
SPEAKER_00: And another factor is, is Larratt going in there with Jody or without? I think without.
SPEAKER_04: no no one knows how to hide there when he puts so much gas on the fire you know canada has chance big chance because jody's not coming okay if jody is coming when jody comes it didn't help that would be against you yes yes yeah it shouldn't help against you yeah anyways leon i was gonna come most likely
SPEAKER_04: but you know, the earthquake happened to Georgia. I was going to come and maybe, maybe in next a few weeks, do you think you would be available? If I, if I come to Tbilisi, you will be a few days, you will be there or not. If, if we do some interview and some, because there are many Georgians at the East versus West, and maybe we would just chat.
SPEAKER_00: Let's finish and the last one the guy is saying that when Devon did the mind games with you were you affected or it was like you didn't care?
SPEAKER_00: It affected him and in a positive way for him. He was more motivated and more willing to win. He wanted the victory more.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, Lewand, thank you very much. You spent your two hours with us and with the community. My friend, the king. And we hope to see you. And if I come to Tbilisi, I see you there. If I cannot come, I see you in Istanbul. Do you think I hyped Denis' match enough? Yes, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_04: uh do you think that uh he hyped the match enough for between him and dennis oh um not really no no no no because it's just it's just too early so yeah listen listen i don't see your problem tell him that he's sitting plant uh he's planting seeds
SPEAKER_04: but but it's too early but everyone knows everyone knows in the community that there is a beef between these two sides there is those georgian sides and those bob can dennis you know morozo the daddy can team and there is a and everyone is waiting for that match but it is not yet not yet because i don't think dennis is ready but
SPEAKER_01: Yes, you did, Levan. Yes, you did. But it is too early. OK. OK, I will wait. You just tell me when. OK. OK, my friend. OK. What was that? What did you say? Whenever you say, I will start the hype.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah. When the time comes, yeah. Just one after another, one after another. And just trust me, Morozov will be 50% stronger than the time that he beat Revas. And you thought Revas was going to beat Morozov. So he is 50% stronger than Levan. He's coming to beat you. He's going to destroy you.
SPEAKER_01: Good, good. I like it. He said that he's going to beat you. He's coming to beat you. There couldn't be any other way. Of course he's coming to win. There is no other way. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: because because le one is the one there you know le one bleeds on february 25th now it's the smell of blood the sharks around exactly yeah okay
SPEAKER_04: Thank you very much, Levan. Thank you, my friend. Thank you, Tonika. You did an incredible job, my friend, as always. My pleasure. You are not the goat, but Tonika is the goat.
