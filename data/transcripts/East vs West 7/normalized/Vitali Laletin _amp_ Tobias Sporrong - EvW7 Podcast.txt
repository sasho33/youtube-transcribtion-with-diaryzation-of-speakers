SPEAKER_04: yeah of course i mean i i like from i like more i like a lot of guys like levon obviously devon uh john um yeah yeah so i kind of i kind of realized that you are not only a fan of one person but you are a fan of armesting this is what i realized like like yeah you you support many guys who are good enough to be
SPEAKER_04: that's what i realized yeah yeah yeah the translation for uh vitale will not be so hard because as far as i remember i did one podcast with vitale about a year ago and not sure if
SPEAKER_04: probably he was not talking a lot he was not talking a lot but um while while while we are waiting uh tell us your predictions about east versus west seven who's gonna be Devon or Genadi oh I think um
SPEAKER_01: think that i think devon will win maybe gennady take one round the first one but his uh his wrist he will just hold him like like like prudnik smudge it will go like that exactly yeah i don't know i mean uh if dave is in good shape if he uh uh leveled up his endurance
SPEAKER_01: he will win not only the second first round this time yeah so i think that day three three zero and how do you see on garbeven uh directly hello hello hello hello uh
SPEAKER_01: Ongarbaev, Vitalii. Ongarbaev, Irakli. I think Ongarbaev will also. How do you see Vitalii? Vitalii is cycling. Can you explain to him? He needs to change the edits from the phone. When I return sideways, it automatically should be
SPEAKER_04: Hello, Tobias, how are you? Can you turn your phone sideways, Tobias? Yeah, of course. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, that's better, yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure if he can hear me. That's good. That's good. That's very good, yeah. So, hello, Vitalii. How are you, my friend? Good, and you?
SPEAKER_04: Good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good to see you. And Tobias, you feeling good? Yeah. Yeah. I have a cold right now, but otherwise I'm feeling good. Just regular cold. Not, not, not like COVID or something, right? No, not COVID or no fever. So just a sore throat. I understand. Yeah. And Vitalii,
SPEAKER_01: how is your form you have a competition very soon right you have a competition in amc event and how is your shape right now uh
SPEAKER_01: And I'm ready to fight. Are you in top form? Yes, I'm in top form.
SPEAKER_04: uh yeah i'm in pretty good shape right now and and and his match against uh tobias will be with left arm but for some time you know he didn't have you know real big competitions with left arm uh how does he feel himself since he has a super match probably he also trains his left arm as well
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii, you have a match with Tobias on your left hand. As you know, you haven't had a match on your left hand for a long time. Accordingly, in the process of your training for KMC, you also train with your left hand.
SPEAKER_00: I always train my left hand, regardless of the tournament, if I have a left hand or not. Since 2018, I haven't fought with my left hand in big tournaments, but I always train my left hand on the same level as my right hand.
SPEAKER_01: So during all preparations for any kind of tournaments or super matches, I always train left arm as well with the right one. So yeah, that's it. So he's in top form? Yeah, he's at his top form. Okay, the last question before we ask Tobias. What's his weight right now?
SPEAKER_00: So I'm currently weighing 133 kilograms.
SPEAKER_01: I don't feel like I need more to compete at this level. Also, I have been trying for a long time to gain weight, more than 133, but I didn't manage to do it. So, yeah. So, now he's in this way. Okay. And Tobias, you. Last time we saw you, as far as I remember,
SPEAKER_04: was against uh rudnick and marcio and then you wanted to you said that you wanted to rest a little bit and prepare better and and then you had hernia and you had to have surgery we had to cancel your match against morozo and now you had surgery you recovered and where are you now where are you just say
SPEAKER_03: compared to your matches with left arm against Prudnik and Morozov? Where are you now, your level? So against Prudnik, I was stronger if we compare to against Morozov. And now I'm a little bit stronger than against Prudnik. There's still some time left before
SPEAKER_04: my match against Vitalii. So I think I will be a little bit stronger in May. Do you think that until that match, like you think you will be 10 or 15% stronger than the match that you were against, uh, Brutnik? It's hard to say, but maybe five or 10%, but it's difficult to say. Yeah. I've just talked about the weights that you are lifting generally.
SPEAKER_04: what what did you say i was just talking about the weights that you are lifting how do you see them you think that you will be like at least with the gym you know at the table it's not so easy to measure you know how much better you are but but with the weight i feel that i'm stronger in my in my arms so i i'm not focused on my yeah biceps and yeah but obviously you didn't really have hand problem anyways with left arm
SPEAKER_04: You had the arm problem and then now if the arm is stronger, that really changes a lot of things. And maybe you can... Yes, and pronation. Pronation now is stronger. Do you think that you are having problem with your pronation? You were having problem with your pronation against the hook pullers or against the top rollers? No, against the hook pullers. So it's not a big problem against Vitalii, but you never know.
SPEAKER_04: for what your opponent will do. So I need to be prepared for a hook. Yeah, yeah. Aleksandr, can you translate simply to Laletin, whatever Tobias said? About that he is preparing for a hook? No. You heard everything he said, that he will be better than this. I don't know. You were following?
SPEAKER_01: So, Vitalii, well, in general, Tobias just said that he is in good shape now, that he scored after the match with Prudnik, with Ertem Morozov, and in general, he doesn't know what, well, he wants to prepare for everything, so he also prepares for the fight in the hook, he also does exercises.
SPEAKER_04: i want to ask to vitally many people and before i ask to which other i want to ask tobias this way what's your weight tobias 132 132 so you are also a little bit heavier than last time you came here or uh the same i think but i'm aiming for 135. okay i understand so you can we say that you are also
SPEAKER_04: still recovering you know to your top shape because of the surgery yeah so all you need is more time yeah i understand can you ask vitally many people you know like tobias is very young he has a bright future while vitally is someone who has proved himself already and on the paper people are saying that
SPEAKER_04: Vitalii is like heavily favored. And what does he think about this? And what does he think about Tobias and his match? What does he think about his chances?
SPEAKER_01: Many people say that Tobias is a young armwrestler, he has a bright future, and you are an athlete who has already formed and proven your strength.
SPEAKER_01: And on the paper, many people think that you are a clear favorite of this match. And what do you think about this? Is it really so? What do you think about this match that will take place? I will say that it is impossible to underestimate the opponents. Tobias showed how good he is with Ertem Morozov. If they fought from top to top, Ertem would have lost to Tobias.
SPEAKER_00: He has a very good height and he fights very well. Therefore, I will be ready for everything. I am preparing for this fight. And, accordingly, the table will show who is stronger.
SPEAKER_01: So you can't really underestimate your opponent. You need to be ready for everything. We saw that in Tobias versus Artyom Morozov match that Tobias, if the battle was top-roll on top-roll, Artyom would lose. We saw it. Vitalii's technique is also top-roll, so he's saying it's not an easy match.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you're right. Yeah, and he added that he is also, as Tobias, getting ready for everything. No, I mean, who played Topol? Oh, okay, okay. So he's thinking that basically Tobias is a dangerous puller and he wouldn't underestimate him. Yeah, yeah, he wouldn't, definitely.
SPEAKER_04: yeah and tobias how do you see your chances against someone like lalitin usually like you are usually taller than your opponents at least same height except when you pull kurdesha with right arm but now you are pulling against someone probably minimum 10 centimeter taller than you and how do you see this also how do you see that vitalis you know
SPEAKER_03: usual low hand top roll for your technique you know how do you see all these things I think it will be more difficult because of his tall long forearm so I think this match will be mostly about if he can top roll me or not and if he can't top roll me I think I probably will win
SPEAKER_04: but it's hard to say exactly how the match will go. Do you think that there is a chance that instead of Tarpal he can beat you with straight side pressure in strap or you think that you are more prepared for this? No, I don't think so. I don't think so. You don't think that he can go side pressure with you? The only way is to get your wrist. Yes, I think so. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And you want to add more? Anything more or is this what you're going to say?
SPEAKER_04: No, I think that's it. That's it. Yeah, maybe you translated Alexander that he says that, you know, he doesn't think that Vitalii can beat him with side pressure. The only way is that he needs to take obvious risks, you know. That is not that easy, you know, thing to do. Or maybe a hook. Or maybe a hook. Yeah, maybe. But I don't think he will try, but...
SPEAKER_04: maybe we'll see yeah yeah i think they would reduce his because like even if he is better than you in hook that hook in you is not that easy because you really need to have a long past so the hook inability while like we know that he all his career he top role you know okay alexander can you translate please my friend
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii, Tobias just said, he voiced his thoughts about the match, what he expects. In general, he thinks that if you win him, then only if you take his hand, that is, if you go up. That is, it will not be that you, for example, just in the tie,
SPEAKER_01: This is what I just wanted to... I asked you to translate this so that they would understand that, you know,
SPEAKER_04: you automatically translate what Vitalii says, but if you don't translate what Tobias says to Vitalii, it is kind of... Can you ask Vitalii what does he think that this will be his first time at the East versus West? Like, what does he think about that stage and event? What he thinks about an event? Yeah, I mean, this is the first time he comes to that stage, East versus West,
SPEAKER_01: How does he feel about that, that he will be competing there? And what does he generally think about the East vs. West events? Vitalii, this is your first time at the East vs. West tournament in Turkey. What do you think about your first performance? And what do you think about this tournament in general?
SPEAKER_00: The tournament is very good, there are a lot of interesting pairs that people are ready to watch. I am very happy that Nginx invited me to this tournament and I will try to show my best result.
SPEAKER_01: So the tournament is very interesting, very good. A lot of people are very interested in watching it as well. I'm very glad that you invited me to compete. Yeah, and I'm looking forward to my first time competing. Yeah, and also tell him that I am also honored to
SPEAKER_01: such a great puller in our events. Tobias, there is a super chat for you. She says, was Tobias's hernia
SPEAKER_04: from arm resting also was it a sudden injury or did it develop over time i had the you know togas i had the same uh surgery mine was interesting while i was lifting it was small small and when i was in the final in 2015 it just there you know even more so i had to have surgery what was yours thank you sean for the super chat
SPEAKER_03: Yes, so I was born with my hernia and I got a problem with it over time when I was increasing my weights in the gym. And I did this surgery like five years ago without a net.
SPEAKER_04: without the mesh, so it came back. I didn't put either. Let's see how mine will be. I had the surgery beginning or maybe end of 2015, I had it. And so I didn't really put the part, you know, there. But let's see. I did not lift so heavy either. My neck, back, everywhere hurts. So, I mean, we will see. And you, did you miss pulling at East versus West stage?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I do, yeah. You did? Yeah, that's good. In May, it's been a year since I faced Prudnik and Barbosa. Yeah, yeah. I'm excited about this. Did you learn, especially from your match with Martiu, about, you know, how to be maybe a little bit more aggressive? I know what you mean, yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I can't give away anything. I need to shake the wrist and everything. I know about this. It's important. It's very important. You can't be too nice. Let's talk about this. I will just try to pass. Can you ask Michaly if he wins this match?
SPEAKER_04: Like, does he see himself, like, in near future to be a champion at East versus West? On left arm. Yeah, because right now we talk about left arm. We will come back maybe to right arm later. Does he see that potential? Does he see himself, like, the potential to become the very best at East versus West?
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii, if you win against Tobias on the left hand, do you see yourself as an East vs West champion on the left hand? No, I will not see myself as a champion.
SPEAKER_00: If I win 100 times, I'm ready to fight all the strongest athletes in this tournament with my left hand to prove my superiority. Then I will consider myself the strongest if I can beat everyone.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so I can't say this for now that I will be a champion. The first thing is that I need to win a lot of guys. And after that, yeah, I need to arm wrestle a little more on the left arm before that. Does she have such a plan? Do you have a plan to become a champion on the left arm?
SPEAKER_00: Well, you know, I never had such plans and I never go to competitions with confidence in winning, that I am sure that I will win. Now I will go without such confidence that I will win Tobias, he is a very good athlete. I myself am interested to see how much he gained and what strength he has. I was always interested in just fighting and feeling how much stronger I became, or my athlete, how much strength he gained.
SPEAKER_01: So no, I haven't got such plans as to be a champion. Coming into every match or every tournament, I don't have the confidence that I will win 100%. So this match can go very different ways.
SPEAKER_01: Tobias is a very strong opponent. I'm looking forward to un-wrestling him. I'm waiting for it. I just love to compete. I understand. And Tobias, what do you think your chance is against Vitalii? And in the long term, do you have a dream to become the world champion at the East vs. West?
SPEAKER_03: I think it will be a close match for sure. I would say 50-50. And of course, my goal is to be the left arm heavyweight champion. Yeah, of course. And where do you think you are? Do you think that if you win this match, it will mean that you are very close to your goal?
SPEAKER_03: Not necessarily because we have Dadikian, we have Morozov. So I don't think so. But it's a big step for me, of course, because Laletin, I mean, he's amazing. He's extremely strong. So this match is very important for me. Yeah. And this guy, Vitalii, has a good chance to beat both of the guys that you also mentioned. Yeah, I know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. I mean, I cannot say that the others don't have any chance at all, but Vitalii, I think, as far as I see around, you know, he has chance, you know, against anyone that I see around. Yeah. I agree. Yeah. And, Alexander, how about your thoughts? What do you think about this match? Well, I think it's...
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii having more experience. I know he's very strong on left arm. He hasn't got injuries in the last years on left arm. Very good shape. I think it's 60, 40, 55, 45 to Vitalii. Can you ask Vitalii which arm he
SPEAKER_00: Which of his arms is stronger than the other? Vitalii, which arm is stronger? My arms are about the same in strength, but my left arm has no injury, so my left arm is better than the right one. I have a start, I have better technique, because I have no injury. And the competition in St. Petersburg showed that I am the strongest in Russia with my left arm.
SPEAKER_01: uh so my uh two arms are roughly the same uh as i as i have mentioned yeah i haven't got a lot of injuries on my arm any injuries i mean so i my technique i
SPEAKER_01: So I pull very technically very good. I have a quick start on my left arm. And recently competitions, different competitions in Russia proves that I am the best left-handed Russian arm wrestler. Yeah, that's how it looks like. Yeah. Yeah. I see this. Yeah. Anyway, so then
SPEAKER_04: Let's talk about a little bit the East versus West matches. I don't know if Vitalii would know all of those guys, but can you ask, Alexander, can you ask Vitalii, has he watched the events before, like East versus West, or only specific matches on YouTube?
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii, do you watch East vs West matches or do you watch the opponent's matches?
SPEAKER_00: Of course, unfortunately, we don't have the opportunity to buy a broadcast and watch it. I would love to buy a broadcast and watch it. But after the competition, I watch all the results, who fought how. And in the future, on YouTube, I review all the fights of the guys. Many people are waiting for this tournament as a holiday. And as one of my acquaintances told me, I'm waiting for this tournament more than my birthday.
SPEAKER_01: yes so i always watch uh i watch many matches on youtube not only for my opponent um in russia there is um no opportunity for me to uh watch um yeah you know to buy a pay-per-view and um
SPEAKER_01: um uh as one of my mates calls me it said once that he is waiting for uh these uh matches east versus west uh more than uh he waits for his birthday yeah anyway so let's let me ask him some okay we tell you what do you think about alijan murado and cody merit match
SPEAKER_00: Vitalii, what do you think about the match between Olezhan Muratov and Kody? Olezhan has a very good start. I think Kody just doesn't have enough to beat someone. He doesn't have enough for the opponent to have a good start. Olezhan has a very good start. I think he will break through and finish off at the start.
SPEAKER_01: So Alizhan has a very good quick start. His opponent doesn't have it. So Vitalii says that Alizhan will just use his quick start and just win with several hits eventually. And how do you see Tobias this match?
SPEAKER_03: yeah probably the same way as vitali i think he is his cupping and the hooking ability is too strong and he is too fast but yeah and can you also ask vitally if alijan gains weight just say like he's 105 kilo or something right now he's 95. like
SPEAKER_04: is is there any possibility alijan to be a threat even for the super heavyweights in professional arena we know that he won the love but in even in professional does he have any chance to be a problem for the top guys in supreme weight uh
SPEAKER_01: We know that he recently won the World Championship, and if he gets to 105 kg, will he have a real chance to be a threat for super heavyweights?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, in any case, he will be a threat, maybe even his own 95 kg will be a threat for heavyweights. We have a very large example, this is Zhong Zheng, who, at one time, with a small weight, fought heavyweights. But again, to gain weight, you need to get used to it, and, perhaps, he will lose his speed, or he will be too busy, so you also need to look at this in the future, when he gains weight.
SPEAKER_01: So, in any case, even if Alizhan doesn't gain weight, he will be a threat, a very weak threat. We have already seen examples of arm wrestlers such as John Brzenk, that he, in being, weighing not a lot of kilograms, he actually managed to win much bigger opponents.
SPEAKER_01: And before competing with a higher way, you need to get acquainted to it. So, yeah, it can't always work very good. Yeah. And obviously, Douglas Erlich versus Prokopcik.
SPEAKER_04: what names did you say douglas the the one that in the last event beat coach ray the first match the american guy doug erich okay i i don't know if i remember okay remember him but okay let me ask you uh rob vision junior yeah that's an interesting match
SPEAKER_03: Surabh got the experience, for sure. Surabh got the experience? Yeah, Surabh got the experience. Yeah, but in this competition in Turkey. Oh, you mean international, I understand. Yeah, but I don't underestimate him. I know he's strong too, so I think it would be a good match.
SPEAKER_01: But I would say Suhrab will have a little bit more chance to win. Okay, I understand. And Alexander, does Vitalii know Rob Vigent? No, I haven't seen him. And I, like, know.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah this is what i was guessing and how about uh that's you know pauline um
SPEAKER_04: david samusha pauline beat in last event pauline won against rushtam rushtam get injured rushtam and pauline beat ram bet and pauline gave very hard match to john brzing and he doesn't remember that pauline um
SPEAKER_01: He recently beat Rustam Babaev, and before that, he beat the American athlete Ron Bette. And he gave a real fight to John Brzenko. I'll put it this way. We, heavyweights, are always interested in heavyweights.
SPEAKER_00: And, let's say, as a rule of thumb, everyone looks at light weights, where everything is more interesting, right, than in weightlifting. In weightlifting, on the contrary, everyone looks at large weights, looks at heavyweights, they are interesting. That is, I used to, even when I fought in Europe, in the world, I knew who was fighting in 90, I knew who was fighting in 100, 110 and above, but already in 80-75 I did not know who was fighting there. It was just not interesting to me.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so I'm mostly interested in super heavyweight division. As in UFC, people follow more super heavyweights. So I know some people, how strong are they in some categories, but not a lot of...
SPEAKER_03: I understand, yeah. And what do you think about Paul Lim vs Sasho match, Tobias? It's a very good match. I think actually that Paul is maybe stronger in his arm. So I think he's going to win, if I have to guess. But Sasho is very, very fast and explosive and strong. So it will be a war for sure.
SPEAKER_04: I understand. Most of the people are seeing Sasho as the favorite, but I really see that match going either way. I mean, Paul, his hook is extremely strong. It's crazy. Yes. I don't understand why he doesn't try right away. He tries top roll. He tried top roll run back. He lost. And then he hooked him three times and beat him. He tried to top roll jump. He lost easily.
SPEAKER_04: And then he gave hell to John Insight. And the last event, he tried to play with Rustam's hand, which is rock. And then the third round, he hit. Unfortunately, Rustam got injured. But in my opinion, it looked more effective than the earlier attempts. You know, this is just my opinion. Yeah, I agree. I agree with you. And another one that I would like to ask you, I will ask you, do you know Brandon Assessor, Tobias?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think so. Yeah. And he is playing against Samushia. After that, the rest is the matches that, you know, Vitalii will also know. So let me ask you this match and then Brandon versus Samushia. Sorry. No problem. I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: uh that much uh about how they poke i've seen samusha and he's uh he's good uh so i think he's going to win this match if i guess so i would say and do you see anyone on this earth in your opinion beating samush at 85 do you think someone like maybe dobrin or
SPEAKER_03: Tautiev or Haji Murad, do you think anyone has a chance against Samushia under 85? No, I think it will be very difficult. I think he's too strong at this time. Even against Haji Murad at 85? Very, very hard to say. Maybe it will be a close match.
SPEAKER_04: I understand. But if we take Taltiev as example, I think he's not going, he will not be able to top roll him. I don't think so. Samushia is too strong. You don't think he can top roll Davit? No, I don't think so. Yeah, but Prokopchik top rolled him. Samushia. You remember? But Samushia still beat him like this, I think round two it was. Okay. I don't remember that. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Alexander, about all these matches that we talk, what are your opinion? You want to share your opinion about any match that we just talked about? I mean, you were talking about Sasho versus Bolin. For example.
SPEAKER_01: yeah i mean i don't uh like i know i didn't know i don't know uh guys uh uh really good uh i saw i saw some matches uh so sure uh looks uh looked uh stronger in hook to me but i don't know i think it will be close if he will come in in really good shape but paul is very dangerous yeah yeah
SPEAKER_04: Okay, let's ask Vitalii to match us and he would know about it. Vitalii, Georgii Dzeranov, RFR10. Vitalii, what do you think about the match with Georgii Dzeranov?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I would say that Georgii Dzeranov was resting for some time, so to speak, that there was no motivation, but when he started to invite, he had a very good motivation. When Georgii has motivation, he works in the hall without putting his hands down.
SPEAKER_00: I think that Georgii will win. He has a very good endurance, he has a very fast movement, not from the start, but in the fight he finishes, breaks through. I think that the victory will be with Georgii.
SPEAKER_01: uh so i know that georgie was uh have been resting for uh for quite a while uh now he has a motivation to to pull uh i i think he will uh most likely to to win uh he he's he's very fast and he can just use
SPEAKER_01: If he doesn't win with a quick start, he can just hit more and more and eventually will win. So he's saying that Zelenov is the favorite? No, I'm just saying that Georgii is going to be the favorite. Yes, Georgii can be the favorite in this fight.
SPEAKER_01: He's pulling Arif, Arif Ertem. Down, Arif Ertem. And Gyorgy, what do you think? Da, da, da, da. Yeah, so Gyorgy can be a favorite. Okay, he said that Gyorgy's been arved. How do you see that match, Tobias? I don't agree. I think Arif is probably like 20 or 30 kilos heavier, right?
SPEAKER_03: yeah probably yeah but the way yeah but i think he's uh he's too strong and too explosive so i think he's going to win i think he's too strong i understand i understand and and okay we tell you revas lucid said dave cheffy
SPEAKER_00: I see now that Rivas is doing very well, I follow him on Instagram. Dave, as always, doesn't post much. But I will say that if Dave is in very good shape, I think he can hold him back, and maybe he will go further. Maybe it will be endurance. And if Rivas can win him, I will give him a lot of respect.
SPEAKER_01: So I saw on social media that Erebus is gaining right now. He's in very good shape. Dave doesn't post really too much, so his forum is unknown currently. If Dave will come into a very good shape,
SPEAKER_01: uh we will probably be able to not allow us to to to take a winning position on on dave and if his endurance will be uh good uh decent uh he will probably win the champion will win if his andrews is good uh
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I have to say that many people don't support Dave Chaffee's good and bad stamina. But I fought with him, and I know that at the moment his stamina is very good.
SPEAKER_01: uh yes uh and uh some people uh a lot of people say that dave doesn't have a good endurance but i arm wrestled him and i can say that his endurance in endurance uh was pretty good uh yeah yeah when i made the the trading cards yeah people criticized about that but yeah it's good to hear from italy and people people's endurance may be bad in one match
SPEAKER_04: and better another match if you train that way also sometimes when you meet against someone who uses endurance is incredible then then your endurance may look not good you know like like both Morozov and Genadi like like incredible endurance they have yeah anyway so how do you see about this match Tobias
SPEAKER_03: I think it's a very, very good match. So I'm looking forward to this one. But I think it's impossible to say who's going to win. So I would say 50-50 about this match. It's impossible for me to say. And like probably Dave has more side pressure. Probably Dave has the best side pressure in the world, you know. I mean, if he had the risk to risk to support his side pressure,
SPEAKER_04: You know, if he had the hand of Levan, probably he would be just smoking everyone to the in bed, you know, just killing them. Yeah. Yeah. And how about, we tell you, Irakli, Zira Khashoggi versus Heder Ghali Ongarbaev.
SPEAKER_00: Both are very strong athletes, very strong, so to speak, tough, but in my opinion, as I see how much they fought. It will be very interesting. I think that now, at the moment, well, in terms of training, Irakli is not putting out, more precisely, Irakli is just putting out his training.
SPEAKER_00: Kadir Ghali doesn't show off his training, but you can see from his training that he has gained a lot of weight. I think he will be able to fight well.
SPEAKER_01: So they both are very strong, they are very solid, they both have good tenacity. It's a very interesting match. Also Irakli does post a lot of training videos and you can see from that he is very strong and in very good shape.
SPEAKER_01: iraqli uh on the other hand doesn't do it i mean on the other hand doesn't do it so you can't really tell i think iraqli will give him a good fight yes we'll give him good fighting who's winning
SPEAKER_04: uh yeah i think that iraq will be able to win oh iraq will win okay that's interesting that's interesting i think i missed it super chat yannis or janice world and does the latin think dino meter help versus top row i don't know what the meter means dino no meter
SPEAKER_01: Oh, it's the squeeze, the tool that we use. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Can you ask him if that thing helps the couple? So we can also ask the same question to Tobias. Vitalii, well, your grip machine, which you release a lot of videos with, it works for the upper jump.
SPEAKER_00: No doubt, it helps. Many say that in armwrestling, fingers are not important. Fingers are very important in armwrestling. When capturing, when fighting, you completely control the opponent. This is very important. But again, you need a strong wrist. If the fingers are strong and the wrist is weak, nothing will help you.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, this tool actually helps because fingers are very important. Strong fingers helps to control your opponent during setup. But if your wrist is weak, you probably lose. So you need to be on the same level. And Tobias? I just see this as a tool.
SPEAKER_03: to see how strong you are in your hands. So it's not like, yeah. It's not a training tool, but just to see how strong your grip is, right? Yeah, yeah. And it doesn't really, like, put stress on your fingers. So it's not, like, enormously, an enormously much. More like you're squeezing with your palm pressure, right? Yeah, I mean, you use your whole hand, but not your, like, fingertips. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And then what's your opinion about your active versus Ongar Bayev, Tobias? It's hard to say. I mean, there are both amazing arm wrestlers, super strong. I think Ongar Bayev will win, but both are super strong, so it's difficult to say.
SPEAKER_03: I'm thinking about if Irakli can top roll Ongarbaev, but I'm not sure. I think it will be difficult for him. But I think he will try, and I think it will go to the straps. And who has the edge? Yeah, I think so. No, Ongarbaev. Ongarbaev has the edge, okay. Yeah, yeah. And how do you think, Alexander?
SPEAKER_01: Well, you asked me actually earlier and I answered that Ungerweif to me is slightly favorite because of his incredible table IQ.
SPEAKER_01: uh he probably has more experience and uh yeah uh iraq this wrist uh hand i mean doesn't look uh too much strong strong because uh john took it um i mean john is here but um
SPEAKER_01: And how do you see the rivals in Chaffee, Alexander? I think Chaffee's side pressure is too much for us right now. Okay, we tell it.
SPEAKER_04: probably the most, I shouldn't say important, but the most weighted match. You know, if I say most important, it will not be fair. There are some other matches, even title matches, but Devon Larratt versus Genadi Kvikvinia.
SPEAKER_01: Well, the most important match in the next competition. Well, I can't say that this is the most important match, because there are others, and it would be dishonest. But Devon Parade against Genadi Kvikvinia. What do you think? Depending on how Devon prepares, he can prepare very well and surprise us.
SPEAKER_00: But still, Genadi is younger, older. I think Devon will torture Genadi. Genadi, accordingly, will gain more weight, I think. It will be very interesting to see. I can't say which of them is the favorite, honestly.
SPEAKER_01: So the outcome of this match really depends on how Devon will prepare for it, because we already saw that before other matches that Devon can prepare so good that it really surprises us. Genadi, on the other hand, is younger, he is more explosive.
SPEAKER_01: But I think that Devon will hold Genadi and exhaust him. It's very interesting, but I can't really tell who is the favorite. Very difficult. Yeah, but he said that he will probably stop Genadi and exhaust him. Probably he's giving us some idea here. And Alexander, what's your own thoughts about this match?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I also have a similar opinion. I think Devon's hand is very strong. It's hard to say, actually, because he had too much with 115 kg guys. So you can't really tell from that how he will perform against Genadi, who is super high weight.
SPEAKER_03: But nevertheless, I think that Devon's hand is stronger. He is strong enough to stop and hold Genadi to exhaust him eventually. And Tobias? I think Devon will cause some problem to Genadi's hand. I think he has so strong pronation and he will go to an open top rope.
SPEAKER_04: And I think Genadi will be exhausted. I think Devon will win. It will be difficult for him, but I think he will win. So do you think there is a chance if Devon goes like this to Genadi to press him like this or impossible? I don't believe so, no. I understand. So you all think that, you know, Devon is the favorite, yeah. Anyway, so Vitalii,
SPEAKER_04: uh vitale told us that uh alexander he said that he is considering all kind of possibilities when he's gonna pull against tobias including hook as far as i real i mean remember what he said um is that because like he's concerned you know about tobias's hand strength
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii, you said about your match with Tobias that you are preparing for everything, that is, you are also training for the hook fight. Is it because you are worried that Tobias' hand may be very strong and he will not be able to pass it up?
SPEAKER_00: I must say that I have always trained both hook and hook in all cases of life, and only under Tobias. I will not adjust, I will go further and look at the future, look at the fight with other athletes. Therefore, I develop both the upper fight and the hook fight. If Tobias wants, we will fight in the hook, no problem. If he wants to fight with the top, we will fight with the top.
SPEAKER_01: So during all my preparations previously in my career, I trained not only Topol, but Hook as well. So it's not like I'm changing something before my match with Tobias. If he wants to arm wrestle in Hook, I will gladly accept it.
SPEAKER_04: but it's just me training in this style for before every match previously okay okay i thought that laletin just in case that he would fail with top roll he would consider going hook for himself you are saying that vitale is gonna go hook only if tobias tries to force him in hook you understand my point
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii, you will fight in the hook only if Tobias goes there himself.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes. I wanted to say something else. Why? Well, everyone thinks that my club is weak and I don't fight in the club for competitions. First of all, it is more injury-prone. And I can fight better at the top. If, for example, I can walk better forward than backward, I go forward, yes, with my chest, and not with my back, I go backwards, because I can't do it there. It's the same here. I can fight more at the top, I fight at the top more, so as not to get injured.
SPEAKER_00: I like it more than fighting in a hook.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, only if Tobias will go in hook, I will gladly accept it. A lot of people think that my hook is weak, but I want to say that I don't often pull in hook during any kind of competition.
SPEAKER_01: I just think that my top roll is better and hook is more injury-prone kind of style to arm wrestle. So, logically, I think that top roll for me is better and that's why I more often pull top roll. I understand. Tobias, do you think that you will have
SPEAKER_03: Like in your mind, is there any plan B if you cannot beat them with outsides? Is there any plan B? Yeah, of course I have a plan B, of course. I have different options, but I mean, we're both top rowers. So I think everyone knows what we're going to try at first.
SPEAKER_04: then we'll see if i have to think about my plan b okay okay i understand and people are asking the current grip strength you know how many kilos they can uh close previous i haven't tried in a few months so i can't tell and what's your best 155.6 155.6 wow
SPEAKER_00: Can you ask the same thing to Aleksandr, to Vitalii? Vitalii, do you use this thermometer for training now? And what is your best result? I didn't use it for training. Of all the people who squeezed it, I squeezed the most. My result is 159.7 kg.
SPEAKER_00: Recently I took it in my hands and lost 155 kg. This is not so far from my best result, but again, to go to the best result, I need someone to overtake me, so that I have the motivation. This is the first thing. Secondly, if you want to lose weight, you need to remove the specialization, to do weightlifting, because your hands are loaded and it is impossible to improve the results when you are doing specialization.
SPEAKER_01: uh so um my best result is um 159.7 uh i don't use it uh now like for for very seriously for serious training uh just sometimes again squeeze it and uh if i do it now the result will be 155
SPEAKER_01: something uh no as i uh did recently um yeah uh and uh uh among all people i'm the best in this exercise with my result uh yeah that's it yeah and the okay before we finish uh can you ask which ali
SPEAKER_00: Who is the... What does he think, first of all, about the Ermes vs. Levan match? I watched the match and saw how they fought. Ermes gave a very good fight to Levan.
SPEAKER_00: But what many people say is that if there were fights, for example, and one fighter gave up, the other would have won.
SPEAKER_00: Well, Levan really won, and I fought in the same gym, and I also felt bad about the minus, like Levan, because there is a very small room, very little oxygen, and there is nothing to breathe. It is very difficult to fight very long fights, such as there were with Ermes and Levan. We fought more often with Deva, it was also very difficult for us because of the breathing, because of how to breathe there.
SPEAKER_01: um okay uh yes i saw the match ermes gave levan a very good battle um it was impressive uh a lot of people say uh that uh if uh if if if in like like as the same in as in ufc if one guy gave up during the match the other guy should
SPEAKER_04: should win automatically but i don't think so uh uh i mean the one uh legitimately won four rounds uh so it's not this situation that that that command is coming from the guys that don't know much about our messing uh because if if like it is submission you know normally when you come to the four rounds it's submission there is no way that you know
SPEAKER_04: there is nothing that can change the results. So we should maybe talk about why the competition, the continues, you know, after the submission, you know, like just think about resting, you put out the guy's shoulders to the there, and then the match still continues, or you, you are in a fight, the guy submits, and then it's, you know, 4-0, it's finished, you know, the last two rounds is just like anyone, like, like nobody like Devon, John,
SPEAKER_03: Even Hermes himself, no, nobody would think that way. You know, it's just like, I mean, some probably new guys, you know, thinking, how do you think about the match and about what, what, uh, Laletin said? I still don't understand how he could pull in that crazy position. He did something very special. Doing that to Levan is crazy. So it was one of the best matches I have seen for sure.
SPEAKER_04: And Laletin, is there anyone, just like we saw Hermes is close, but still lost, as you said. And is there anyone that has chance to beat Levan? Can you ask him, please? Vitalii, how do you think, after we all saw how Hermes performed in the match with Levan,
SPEAKER_00: Do you think you'll ever have a chance to beat Levan? You know, a lot of people tell me that Levan is too far away for me. But I'm not obsessed with that. I don't have a dream of beating Levan, which I once did. I don't have such a dream. I believe that everything has its time.
SPEAKER_00: For example, let's take John Bruzenko. There were so many guys who beat him. Where are they now? And John Bruzenko is still fighting. And he's not fighting on a bad level, he's fighting on a good level. The most important thing is to hold on for a long time. And they will remember you. And if you played for 2-3 years and won everyone, then you lost and everyone forgot about you.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so a lot of people say to me that I am far from Levan, but I want just to point out that it's not my dream to meet Levan. Time will come, maybe to the point where I will be able to
SPEAKER_01: give him a very good match again and it's like the same as with John Brzenk so previously like some a lot of years ago a lot of some people won against John but where are they now it's like we don't know but we know about John who lost to them
SPEAKER_01: that he now competes at this age. So this is the key thing to be able to compete for a very long time and to be remembered. Okay, this is important. People say that, you know, I caught you. They say that we tell you talk about there was no enough
SPEAKER_01: space oxygen or something in there what was that part that you couldn't translate uh yes so uh he said that he also armrested armrested in that room previously with Dave he said that uh the reason like the room here has uh
SPEAKER_01: a very small space and the oxygen is not enough and he completely understands the one because the similar thing happened to italy but maybe not so he's saying that you know one of the reason that
SPEAKER_04: F. Ponta and Apurva L.: The one didn't have you know enough oxygen and he thinks that the space wasn't big enough yeah Okay, I understand and and Okay, so also tobias like is there anyone that can meet the one and also. F. Ponta and Apurva L.: The airmasters performance show that the one is readable, in your opinion. F. Ponta and Apurva L.: yeah it showed a.
SPEAKER_03: that it's possible to beat him. But I think there are not many who can do it. I think maybe Suplenko, if he gets bigger and stronger. But other than that, I don't think anyone can do it right now. I understand. I understand. Yeah. And can you ask the same question to Vitalii? Did Hermes' performance show that, like Levan,
SPEAKER_01: is an incredible human being, but still human and possible to reach. Vitalii, what do you think about the fact that Hermes fought with Levan and after that match, did you get the impression that Levan is still a very strong, very special athlete, but still reachable and he can still win?
SPEAKER_00: I will say so, yes, Levan is undoubtedly a very strong athlete, but there are no unattainable athletes. Take Levan, yes, he has a very good genetics, he can gain weight, muscle mass, he can gain others, it's just not possible. Let's say I'm not given to gain a lot of weight, I'm given, I'm sitting there, I gained 130-135 kg, that's it, I'm not given anything else yet. Will I gain weight today? I will gain at least.
SPEAKER_00: Levan can lose 20 kg in a month. And due to the weight, the strength also grows. And he is undoubtedly, I repeat once again, a very strong athlete. But there are no unreachable. This is in any case. And many of the strongest athletes just start to give up without competition. And they start to be lazy to do it. Because they understand that they are unreachable. And it becomes uninteresting for them. Winning is not a problem. The problem is to stay on the pedestal. That's the problem.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so yes, I think Levan is actually very, very strong, but there are no such people that can't be reached and that are unbeatable. Levan has very good genetics. He can easily gain weight as well.
SPEAKER_01: For example, I can't do it. So my mass is like 133 kilograms, 135. So it's extremely difficult to gain more. On the other hand, during one month can gain about 12 kg.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, 12kg. He is, again, very strong, but he can be reached. And it happens sometimes that big, very
SPEAKER_01: big athletes without like competition resistance they begin to they start to be lazy and it's getting more and more easy to to reach them if they don't train enough okay can you ask him who does he think that is number two in the world right now
SPEAKER_00: Vitalii, who do you think will be the world's number two now? Well, I think that in order to determine that, we need a tournament like the one we had in the top-8. So that we can decide. Because many athletes can't compete in the same tournament. Everyone is always in a different shape. Well, let's take, for example,
SPEAKER_00: Now, at the moment, what does it show? Yes, Hermes fought with Levan, it turns out that Hermes is in second place now, right? Since it happened so. Levan doesn't need to continue to fight with someone else, he needs to fight with Hermes. Hermes was worthy of second place in the world. So they fought.
SPEAKER_01: Well, so it's really difficult to say right now. So you, to answer it, to clarify this question, you need tournaments like Top 8 was like some years ago. So when, so because
SPEAKER_01: um or a lot of athletes are always in a different shape uh time to time to like two no i mean you got me uh
SPEAKER_01: Radek Machanovic- Considering how errors are mostly one, we can say that he's number two but. Radek Machanovic- The one doesn't pull a lot, and we can answer this. Radek Machanovic- question on I mean based on the on the ones versus the one versus arms much. Radek Machanovic- Because he doesn't pull out yeah.
SPEAKER_04: okay yeah but like to find out this with the top eight type you know i i disagree i mean with top eight you know i mean for the overall then rushtan babayev there rudnik is there on that web is there i don't think that when we are trying to find out the best guys in the world this like lighter ways to middleweight type of guys
SPEAKER_04: I mean like it doesn't really determine anything it doesn't have to be like that, but every three months, the artists are already pulling you know, like animals also pull them chaffee. And jerry Goddard will get out again at the pool, you know. They have chaffee and last event people for it, you know, so these events doesn't.
SPEAKER_04: have to be like that but you know once you guy beats you know we can put the rank the other guy and who do you think tobias is number two right now no doubt yeah yeah yeah i understand yeah and yeah okay and and the last question i want to ask you uh vitally uh
SPEAKER_04: does he like he talks about like he follows only the super heavyweights but in just say like the most right now most famous and uh combat physical combat sport is like ufc the the organization and like that when you look at the the followers of the athletes you know uh like you have you see you have mcgregor
SPEAKER_04: And then the second is Habib. And then the rest is just like not even comparable, you know, about the fame, about the making money. Does he think that if I would only focus only like three matches, like super heavyweight matches, like instead of the like 10, 15 matches and then give chances to lightweights, welterweight, middleweight, light heavyweight, left arm, right arm woman,
SPEAKER_01: Do you think that it is a better way to bring armwrestling to the next level? Vitalii, well, in general, Engin says that you said that you only watch the heavyweights. You know someone, but you mostly watch them.
SPEAKER_01: For example, UFC has Conor McGregor and Khabib. They have the most famous fans.
SPEAKER_01: than many heavyweights. And the question is, if, for example, Engin will organize the matches in such a way that there will only be heavyweights, and not with heavyweights, 85-95 kg guys, if this is the case,
SPEAKER_00: Will such a way of organizing matches lead to the fact that armwrestling will grow and become more popular among many people? I will say that you don't need to forget about lightweights either, because many guys who are lightweights, they sit only for lightweights. Well, and, accordingly, they are interested in just looking at heavyweights.
SPEAKER_00: If you only leave the heavyweights alone, then the weightlifting will not be interesting, there will be no incentive and the sport will not develop. I think that you should not forget about the lightweights too. And I always invite them to fight too. But in any case, more athletes always look at the heavyweights.
SPEAKER_01: so you for sure you can't forget about more light guys than super heavyweights because they for example they look for the guys and matches of their category they are interested in it but they also follow super heavyweights
SPEAKER_01: superheroes are an essential part in arm wrestling but nevertheless it's more interesting to look how superheroes arm wrestle yeah i mean it used to be the same in boxing as well but what i'm just saying that the things if you give opportunity to the light categories and then
SPEAKER_04: present them to the world. You know, 20 years, 30 years ago, people were crazy only about the super heavyweight, Mike Tyson, Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, and everything. And we ended up like Mayweather making the most money, a very lightweight boxer. So this, it was same with the fighters as well. And now we ended up 70 kilo guys being the most popular guys, you know, because they put the character in it, they put the challenge in it and everything.
SPEAKER_04: So what I'm just saying, like you can't expect the world to show interest into something which you don't present to them. So can you translate that one?
SPEAKER_01: In the UFC, there are a lot of athletes, there are super heavyweights, but despite this, lightweights, for example, Floyd Mayweather, make the most money on his fights, that is, more people watch these fights.
SPEAKER_01: And it still turns out that, organizing matches for armwrestling, you need to organize matches with guys from lighter categories, so that the world finds out about them, so that people find out about them in general and give them a chance.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I agree that light weights should also be present. They have a certain circle of fans, in any case, who will watch their light weights and will watch heavy weights. And they, of course, are necessary in our sport.
SPEAKER_01: uh yes i completely agree uh um guys from more light from lighter categories also have fans uh the the fans uh of these guys uh who watch closely uh their matches and also the matches of uh super heroes and uh i think it's uh obviously you need to give chances
SPEAKER_03: to lighting guys yeah yeah we need to grow arm lasting all together as a series what do you think about this subject obvious before we close i agree with you and i think the lighter guys also deserve matches so i think when you invite them i think they deserve to prove themselves but i think it's good i mean we have we have of course still
SPEAKER_04: super heavy weight like more super heavyweight matches heavyweight matches because this is what community wants from us they buy paper real of course i need to give them what they want but at the same time i need to introduce hey there are some guys that you may not know they are lighter but they are also great this is what i try to do that's why i don't do like six lightweight matches and two super heavyweight because i know what they want to see
SPEAKER_04: But maybe if we give them more option, maybe with time they will like it. And if they like it, then we will do more and more. You know, I'm just trying to balance. But I don't think that we can be considered as a serious sport by giving armwrestling only something just for entertainment. You understand?
SPEAKER_04: to be considered seriously we need to really present the world we are a sport with the lightweight and the welterweight and the middleweight and overweight and this so because you understand my point there cannot be a support only with a few top top super heavyweight guys you know so and that is that is my my point yeah anyways vitally thank you very very much my friend spasiba and
SPEAKER_04: I hope to see you in Istanbul and I wish you the best at the AMC event. Can you translate, Alexander? I wish you the best. Vitalii, I wish you the best.
SPEAKER_01: I wish you a good performance at the AMC, at the upcoming tournament. I also look forward to your arrival at the tournament in Turkey. I wish you all the best in your performances. Thank you for the invitation. I wish him good preparation for the tournament, to be organized, to be at the highest level, without any mistakes.
SPEAKER_01: um and also i want to as well i want to to thank you for the invitation i wish you to to prepare the tournament uh very good for people to like to to to to the tournament to be very interesting yeah it's an honor to host him here he's a legendary puller and we are honored to host him here
SPEAKER_01: thank you i wish you will meet soon thank you and tobias thank you very much my friend you are one of my uh personal hopes
SPEAKER_04: Not that I favor you against Vitalii. I don't really care about that. I'm an organizer. Whoever deserves wins. But you are one of the guys that I have eyes on. And you are one of our hopes. You are like one of my personal hopes. Not for this match, but for the future. And I'm very happy that you are back. And I also wish you the best. And thank you for being our guest and taking part at the East vs. West.
SPEAKER_03: I can also have your last words. Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. That means a lot to me. And I'm also looking forward to the future. But first, this match with the battalion. So I'm very excited for this. Yeah, me too, me too. Just be 100% sure that you deserve, my friend. You deserve. Nobody is giving you a favor. You just deserve it to be on this stage. And Alexander, my friend,
SPEAKER_04: You are a fan. You just wanted to be part of the show instead of having you, you know, in a different show. So you said that you can translate. We didn't have so many chances, you know, for you to talk. But before we close, do you want to have while you have this opportunity, you want to have your own questions to these two great athletes?
SPEAKER_01: I'm honored as well for the opportunity because it's actually very amazing for me to think that I actually speak to you right now, to Vitalii as well.
SPEAKER_04: i don't have really questions i mean i i can ask but uh maybe they will they want to go i don't know yeah i mean they will they will take a minute for you you are a friend you know that this is yeah of course yeah yeah see you said of course you know if you have anything to ask just ask if you don't have it i understand it's totally up to you my friend
SPEAKER_01: no well i can just some uh question to tobias for example um uh tobias do is how do you think your march left hand will go against uh alijan right for david that you can like potentially
SPEAKER_03: Those styles are the most difficult ones for me, because if they get my pronator, it's a big chance that I will lose the match. And that's why I'm also focusing on this in my training right now. Even though I'm facing Laletin, it's still important for me to think about the future too and my future matches. So I think it would be difficult matches. But as I said, I'm preparing for the future too.
SPEAKER_04: I would like those matches really, really much. And tell Vitalii that, you know, you are a fan. You just, you are not a translator and you took part. And if you want to have a question for him, also ask him and then translate for us, please, if you have it.
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii, Engin asked me to say that I'm not a translator at all, I'm just a fan. We wrote to him and he suggested to translate the interview for you. He asked me to tell you that I'm just a fan.
SPEAKER_01: He suggested to ask a question to the athletes. I asked Tobias. No problem, of course.
SPEAKER_01: I'm trying to ask an interesting question about future matches. If you have a match with Devon, do you think you can beat him? I can't say for sure.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I've been ready to fight with him for a long time. I would fight without any problems with my left hand. I'm ready to fight with any athlete who is ready to fight with me. I'm recovering my right hand, and soon I'll be able to fight with any athlete I want.
SPEAKER_01: So I tried to ask an interesting question. So I asked him about how he sees his potential match against Devon Loret. Because if it happens any time in the future, so he says that he will gladly pull him. He thinks that he'll be ready, he's able to be ready.
SPEAKER_04: he will be ready for devon if there is an opportunity yeah yeah yeah i understand yes you know i i apologize and we said we're gonna close but for sure promise the last question somebody just asked he pulled against zaur but before he pulled against zaur he had a match with uh slave
SPEAKER_04: So he played against Zaur and he played against Levan. Of course, Levan match was some years ago. What does he think about Zaur's chance against Levan before we close? Remind him that this is a friend, ask him, and then we close him for sure.
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii, the last question. Engin says that the fan in the chat asked the last question and we are leaving. Recently, you fought with Zaur on AMC, the penultimate.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it so happened that you were fighting Dimitriy Silayev before that, so maybe you were tired there, that is, well, there may be different reasons. In general, before that, you were fighting Levan, well, sometime in 2019. And how do you feel about Levan against Zaur? How is this match? Well, it's clear that Zaur has a injury, but if he recovers, that is, through a goal, I don't know how the match will turn out.
SPEAKER_00: Maribaba and Zaur are very strong sportsmen in endurance. I am more than sure that they will beat Levan. If Levan supports Zaur, then Levan will offer a lot of effort because he is not weak now. In the future, I would like to see this fight. But again, Zaur needs to stop now.
SPEAKER_01: So he thinks that Zaur is very, very strong. It will for sure be a very interesting match.
SPEAKER_01: even though he thinks that Zaur will probably be a bit worse on endurance. And considering the fact that how Levan recently arm-wrestled Aramis, Vitalii thinks that Levan will work on it. So I think he meant endurance. He will progress in that aspect.
SPEAKER_01: um and he wishes our speedy recovery uh because he first is our first need to recover um yeah that's it okay thank you thank you very much vitaly you take care of yourself and tobias you also take care of yourself and alexander yeah you all take care thank you again take care thank you

SPEAKER_04: uh my friend uh it is as supported as people who claims that it helps but the difference is that people who claims that it helps they don't risk anything while i risk and invest you understand so i just find it disrespectful that's all you know like you to even argue about
SPEAKER_04: something that you know what i invest while you just sit on your couch and just like argue about this why this it was like a kind request i mean you have nothing to lose i have a lot to lose so just all i asked for was respect but it seems like people like yourself just can't respect and just still come here and argue while i buried the subject just do whatever you want you want to do that just continue to but if you reject a friendly request
SPEAKER_02: don't expect me to be your friend anymore, you know. Anyway, so guys, thank you very much. And I don't know if there was like any more questions, anything, probably no. And yes, I need to do everything for free.

Or if you want to continue the drama,
SPEAKER_04: just go next three weeks if you need the subject for, you know, your YouTube channel or something, whatever. Just like I'm sick of with my friend. I am trying to serve arm wrestling. I don't really have time for these things. I'm trying to set matches. I'm trying to entertain the community, having guests and trying to do something, you know. I ask, you don't like it, just continue whatever you do. I don't want to talk about it. Just stop bringing here, you know, just stop. It's like a Brazilian
SPEAKER_04: TV show, you know, just continue, continue, continue, continue, just enough, you know. Anyways, Alexander, it was very good to meet you, my friend. I see that you're a smart guy and thank you for helping me for translation. Seriously, I'm very happy. And I'm telling you and all the other fans, like we all here,
SPEAKER_04: There is no one is higher than other one because of better arm master or more popular. So just enjoy your time. You're just a friend. And then we have something in common, which is the love and passion for the sports and just never make anyone bigger on your head. Yes. Good arm master, great arm master. Even respect him. He feels also good personality, but that's it. You know, that's it. We all are same eye level, you know, same eye level.
SPEAKER_01: So yeah, thank you, Alexander. Thank you, my friends. And who knows, maybe we continue and your turn comes again and we see you someday again. Yeah, that's for sure.

SPEAKER_04: and in turn it says to me that we are friends that's come on i just give you advice don't make anyone like what's interesting human being you human being we are friends that's all okay my friend but without without you guys this doesn't really matter all we do to entertain give you guys something to enjoy so just remember that you guys are the
SPEAKER_04: main ones so always think that way my friends okay yeah yeah i think again yeah i think you and you you take care of yourself alexander thank you you're engine as well
SPEAKER_01: And just one small thing. After guys left, you were talking about some hater who apparently wrote something in Superchat. You always overreact to these guys. I mean, they're haters. You don't always have to answer all these things that irritate you.
SPEAKER_04: i mean this this in this is the internet uh this always happens uh here i mean i understand but i i have my friend alexander i'm almost 50 years old you understand i have the competitive life about everything that's my nature and i'm tired of it understand right now if you ask me like what i need is to organize these events
SPEAKER_04: not that what i need is but but i saw that during the covet the community needed so i step up so it continued this way and i promised the community that as long as they support me i'm going to organize but for me the motivation is important you understand when they come there and this like that headache you understand so like i because they spread you understand
SPEAKER_04: They spread, it's like a disease, you know. They spread, you know, they create the perception games. Every event they find something. You do everything perfect, they look at the event, they see 99 positive things, and if there is something negative, and then they just like, you know, like pianos, you know, they just attack there, you understand? So what I do, I just block them because, I mean, it bothers me. So if it is bothering my motivation,
SPEAKER_04: what I will do, either I will go away or I will just exclude them. So with the people as yourself, with the positive intention, they can still criticize, but there is a way to do it. You understand? There's a way to do it. Yeah. And yeah, it's okay. Like you just now criticized me, right? You just said, you know, you need to ignore it. Yeah, yeah, you did it, but it's okay. It's a friendly, nice, more...
SPEAKER_04: no no it's okay it's okay i understand you criticize and it's just i see your positive intention so why would i be upset but if you come as a hater and i would just say go away you know just like it's what i would do you know it's all about the intention anyways alexander my friend you take care of yourself and thank you again for being part of it and hope to see you someday again
SPEAKER_01: yeah i hope to be here some time in the future thank you for invitation again and again and i guess goodbye take care of yourself thanks guys thanks guys and hope to see you next time
