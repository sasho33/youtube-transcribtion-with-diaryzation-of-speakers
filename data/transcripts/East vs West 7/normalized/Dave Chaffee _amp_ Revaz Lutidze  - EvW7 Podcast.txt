SPEAKER_04: hello dave you hear me yeah yeah i hear you how are you good how are you doing good good good good to see you um soon soon they will join us hopefully i hope so yeah
SPEAKER_00: So how is everything? Pretty good, I guess. You know, training's going okay. You know, getting through it, basically. So I was kind of messed up from the Vitalii match for quite a while with my hand. It was really jacked up for a long time. So I hadn't been using it for months, honestly, in my training. And probably like in March, I was able to start using it again. And it still kind of hurt. Finally, about a couple of weeks ago,
SPEAKER_00: went away my hand actually feels good for the first time in six months so finally that's good so you finally recovered yeah yeah that's good that's good my hand that is my neck still jacked up but my hand feels pretty good yep so other than i'm doing pretty good you know you look big you look big show us some forearm yeah that looks good put on a couple pounds i'm trying i'm trying it's hard for me to gain like
SPEAKER_00: any more weight than i can get like usually 275 280. i put on a couple pounds i'm doing my best i might have to get some like weight gainer or something to try to gain some weight some something you know meal replacements or something because i just can't get over the hump of 275 280. yeah i mean like you don't hurt you you don't hurt you i mean sometimes sometimes you know look at level now he's trying to lose weight of course you are not that big but no no yeah i could never get that
SPEAKER_00: Do you do any kind of cardio? No, I should do cardio, but I don't. When I used to go to the gym, I would walk on the treadmill and stuff like that, but I started walking with my wife around the neighborhood, but that's the only extent of the cardio that I do, really. I don't do anything like that. It's no fun for me. Yeah, it's not fun, but sometimes we need more oxygen. Oh, absolutely, 100%. I know I should do it. I definitely should do it.
SPEAKER_00: Getting myself to get off my butt and do it, that's the thing. And can you say that your shape is better than last time we saw you? In some ways, like my, you know, my hand feels better. My neck is, it's pretty bad, unfortunately. Like it's just the same. My left arm's numb half the time.
SPEAKER_04: Um, luckily it's my left arm that it's bothering. You know what I mean? I had the same issues. I had the same issue. My chest was totally like melted on, on only the ribs. You could see shoulder was gone. That was gone. Left arm was like 30 centimeter, you know, just like nothing, you know, because I almost became paralyzed, but it was left side and, and, but, but still, you know, it affects, you know, when you are training.
SPEAKER_00: It definitely does. Like if I move the wrong way, it just shoots the pain right down the back of my neck. It's just miserable. You know, I want to, I want to be able to train like I want to train a hundred percent. And some, you know, some days I just can't do it. It kind of, it's very frustrating. So. Do you think that the stem cell would help there too? They are saying that it helps so many, many different things. I, you know, I've looked into it. It's just a lot of, it's a lot of money for it to may or may not happen.
SPEAKER_00: know if it's if it's 100 yeah it's going to help me i would i would do it yeah but if it's it's just an if you know what i mean that's the thing yeah and then maybe maybe you should talk with devon maybe they would also help you you know i talked to that i talked to devon and i talked to the guy that devon put me in touch with and it just was seemed like a lot of money to me for it to possibly they wouldn't sponsor no he was he was going to be like four grand per shot
SPEAKER_00: and it seemed like a lot of money like at least he said at least two shots so i don't know i think there is one also in in mexico i'm planning to go there actually yeah i talked to uh i talked to dave shea about that one it seemed a lot cheaper i just recently talked to him like probably like three four days ago about it so i might i might look into that one actually yeah yeah yeah yeah hello revas hello roman how are you guys
SPEAKER_04: Hello, hello, guys. Hello, Dave. Hello from Georgii. 80% of the Georgii are joining us in the car. Nice, very nice. Yeah. He looks younger. He is Roma. He is Roma.
SPEAKER_03: uh they uh it was just a remark that you also wear the red t-shirt just like him he's you're his brother very nice yeah it's good to be brother with him
SPEAKER_01: Again, he says hi to you. With big love, he says hi to you, with big love. Can you ask him, like, could he not find any better place than, you know, like driving, you know? So he was...
SPEAKER_03: wow so so he's actually on the way to his um village yeah from tbilisi he was traveling to his village which is located like a 100 and uh like 1500 uh kilometers above sea level quite a high and he's about to park now and then he'll find yeah that far you know make sure that he is
SPEAKER_04: You better make sure there is internet there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is like last 22 days. How does he feel about getting destroyed by Dave Sheffy? Dave is too nice to steal the pot, so let me do it.
SPEAKER_04: all right all right i think it has no problem stirring the pot he definitely does yeah is it possible that you turn your phone uh sideways and yeah can you do the same thing or no i will i will ask you this oh i hope you're not gonna cause accident he's going sideways now
SPEAKER_03: Ask him about the question. .
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_01: Sometimes I think it's a shame, but I don't think it's a shame. I don't think it's a shame. I think we're doing a great job. We're doing a great job.
SPEAKER_01: This guy usually we're hardly hardly getting a word from his mouth till today now
SPEAKER_03: Wow, he's changed a lot. I will tell you everything. So he started by saying how much he actually appreciates Dave as a person because he has been several times on the East versus West and he kept meeting with him.
SPEAKER_03: So they met each other quite several times and he knows that Dave as a person is a really good guy, humble guy. And that's why he respects him so much. He didn't, he, he did not specify any reason like how to, uh, how would he be any like angry on him and like, uh, try to punish at the table or something like that. He didn't never mention. He just said how, how much he respects you, Dave. So he would, uh, appreciates your sportsmanship and your personal characteristics that you always deliver.
SPEAKER_03: And then he was speaking this much, and then he said that it almost sounds like I like guys, but it's not like that. I just respect them. So that's why he started to laugh. And other than that, he said that from himself, from his personal history, he's quite
SPEAKER_03: unhappy about his last performance, we all know, and he tries to redeem himself as best as possible. So he tries to make as good show and as much exciting match as possible. He says that it's time for me to redeem myself. Okay. And Dave, what does this match mean to you?
SPEAKER_00: Well, it means a lot. Rivas is an awesome competitor. I've watched him the last few years. Of course, he looks huge. I don't know why everybody that has to pull me has to seem to gain like 50 pounds every time they arm wrestle me. It's like always the biggest version of that guy. He looks like he ate himself or something. He's a monster. The answer is there. Just look at yourself, how strong you are. Just look at the mirror. And anyone who's facing it, they know that they need to match your horsepower somehow.
SPEAKER_04: to stop you. Even Hermes won against you, but he stopped you right here, you know. So you understand that, yeah, they need to have super power to stop you. Your side pressure is second to none in this world. If you had Levan's wrist, now you would be toying with all these guys around, you know. Yeah, I'm just a little guy compared to these super heavyweights. I'm going to have to, like, go down to, like, the 220-pound class or something like that. It's crazy.
SPEAKER_00: But I'm looking forward to pulling Revaz on the table. He's like me. He's quiet. He gets a job down on the table. Doesn't like to talk a lot of smack. I respect him 100%. It's going to be a great match. He's got such a strong hand. I see he said he's disappointed from his last match. But that match he had with Morozov was a great match. Could have went either way. It was awesome to watch. It's going to be fun. Looking forward to pulling him. I can't wait.
SPEAKER_03: Can you ask him his weight? Revaz, you have a lot of weight. What do you think your weight will be? I think I will be 12-13 kg. But I think I will be 13-14 kg.
SPEAKER_03: So right now, as we speak, he's 152 kg, around so. Wow. But he... 335 pounds. Oh, that's it. Okay. Instantly do the calculation there. Okay. And he wants to drop, like, during the competition, he expects himself to be dropped, like, maybe 4 kg, like 148 or so. Yeah. So around 150 he will be, I guess. And then, Dave, he asked about your weight.
SPEAKER_04: I weigh about 280 pounds. I'm not sure how much kilograms is, but 280. It is about 127 kilo. So tell Revaz that, you know, to make it fair, he needs to lose extra 10 kilo to the competition. Please lose 10, 15 kilograms. I would appreciate that. That would be wonderful. Tell him thank you. Yeah, tell him that we have new rules that there can't be
SPEAKER_03: such a big difference between two athletes. But just ask this with a straight face so he wouldn't, yeah. So, all right. .
SPEAKER_03: He knew I was joking. I could not make him fool me. He knew. He cannot cut down 15 kg, I'm sorry. I mean, he's sorry. He cannot cut down 15 kg.
SPEAKER_01: So, Engin, he was referring to his one of the European championships when he won. He was, he's talking about 110 kg categories.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he usually being 125 before the tournaments, and he was just doing some cardio. He was easily dropping. Yeah, but 15 kg right now to drop, Dave, I'm sorry. 110 sounds wonderful. Get him down to 110 kilograms. That'd be beautiful. Yeah, your world title in 2010, it was 110 kg. They used to mock everyone. You beat Tokarev and other guys.
SPEAKER_00: I was like, wow, you know. Yeah, that was my first big, that was my first big, you know, real big win, 2010 WAF. That was, that was, that was awesome. But I weighed, I was probably weighed 258 to get down to 242. I cut like probably 16 pounds or something like that to get done. You know, like he did. He cut some weight to get down to 110 kilograms. Yeah, your friend James had been telling me like how strong you are. He was telling me and you can't believe
SPEAKER_04: there is a guy incredibly strong, like I wish like you could train with him, you know, the guy incredible. It was that Northeast message board times, you know, he was telling me. And then I saw you and then you just winning the WAF Worlds because like that real, the reality check is to meet those Eastern guys. And when you meet them at the WAF Worlds, and I was like, wow. And I don't think it was even close as far as I remember that you just smoked everyone there.
SPEAKER_00: was it was pretty awesome because no one expected me to anybody from the united states to do anything there really at wwf back then uh it was pretty cool going in as you know as a semi nobody and just actually winning it um yeah most of the matches weren't klotokov gave me a match and then he found out in the end um but other than that it was you know it was a pretty you know it was most of the matches were pretty quick yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: The whole of Europe. It was like that, but I don't think it's going to change. There was a time when the whole of Europe was very, very interesting to me. I was very interested in it. I was very interested in it, and I still remember how I met Tsona.
SPEAKER_03: Engin, he wanted me to remind you that he remembers times when you were also cutting down weights during the WAF competitions, you know, and back then there was times like WAF was a really, really tough competition, you know, and he remembers how you were also... You know what I'm talking about, right? In WAF, you know, there are people like Megamodiodi, Genadi, Lewany, Arif...
SPEAKER_01: It was very interesting. Now I think it's very interesting that Georgii is not a Russian country and Russia is not a Russian country. For example, there was a period when Russia was very important for all of us. These Georgii, for example, in that period, were very interested in Russia.
SPEAKER_03: He wanted to also to point out that those good times of the tough, tough competitions may will never come back because of this situation that Georgii cannot compete, Russians cannot compete, like this type of competition. I think it's changing. As far as I know, I have the information. I think soon both will be competing. This is the news that
SPEAKER_03: i got unofficially this is what i heard that both of them they they can compete okay you continue what he was saying so he he pointed out that fact that those times such high competition he kind of misses that times as well and he said that those times may never come back because of all these countries are out
SPEAKER_03: he mentioned the names and he then he said that there were also good times for Georgii because we were winning team like competitions there like three times in a row or so and you should be remembering that that's what he pointed out also and basically that's what he said about this time yeah yeah 1994 in Sweden when I won my first world title the Georgii especially with right arm I think
SPEAKER_04: 50 kilo i think ronnie englund i think won 55 i won and i think 75 andreas runstrom won like a few category except a few category all georgians won that that that 1994 i think there was zaur one david calitza one uh no no yawa has the latest later came
SPEAKER_04: At that time, probably he was like 10 years old or something.
SPEAKER_03: Revaz probably. Revaz is probably 10 years old now. Anyway, so Revaz, just let's be less political. Are you going to beat this guy? Well, it's a political question. I don't know if he's going to win or not. I don't know if he's going to win or not. Well, I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: So,
SPEAKER_03: He already talked about how much he respects you. Regardless all this respect he mentioned that he has towards you, obviously he is coming for a win and he expects the same from you, right?
SPEAKER_03: even though he thinks that you are also kind of like him right now, he thinks like, because of such a high value of as a sportsmanship and as a sportsman you are, and this kind of respect you have, he thinks it's mutual. And because of that, he also thinks that maybe you are also kind of
SPEAKER_03: trying to force yourself to get angry or something you know to beat this guy right but he said that right now i speak i try to speak as calm as possible but in my heart i'm trying to be as raging as possible and i will deliver we are both coming from blues so lost
SPEAKER_03: And we both need to... And that makes me even stronger to think about that, that we are both coming from loss and we need to get our W. Yeah. Battle to survive. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: what he said let's let's see which one which one gonna be um proving point uh kazakhstan or italy i don't know why he said that one oh probably one lost to the kazakh guy the other guy was to italian this way ah exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah and just just like what does he think his winning chance he doesn't need to give by percentage but like he thinks that
SPEAKER_01: His chance is higher than his opponent's.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, something like that. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_01: Well, the plans are the same. No matter what happens, this is not a good thing. I don't know why. If you think about it, some things will happen and some things won't. Some things will happen and some things won't happen, and some things will happen and some things won't. That's the way it is.
SPEAKER_03: So he mentioned that he kept pointing or underlining this factor of how much he kind of disappointed in his last performance. It really made him to think about some things, you know, because previous matches he has had on East vs West, he was coming from victory, victory, victory.
SPEAKER_03: he lost and now after that loss he's really really changed some things necessary things and he's coming really prepared however just because they don't know each other on the table how each other like how strong each others are they are he cannot say specifically i have more percentage or dave has more percentage so
SPEAKER_03: then i asked are you meaning 50 50 then they said yeah basically that's 50 50 i don't know him right now and after we grip up after first round i can say but now okay so that's a big question mark for him he just he just kept saying he's very uh tried to change some things after his loss because uh i understand yeah so he took lessons from last time this time he's coming to win but he doesn't know what exactly he's going to do and dave how do you feel
SPEAKER_00: I feel about the same. I know it's going to be a good match. I respect him 100%. He's very powerful, huge hand. I think it's going to go either way. I think it's going to go five matches, honestly, three, two. I think this will be a great match. I'd like to say I'm going to come out on top. I know it's going to be a war.
SPEAKER_00: um i hope i have the gas tank to get through i've been working on some endurance as usual trying to you know work on little things here just like he has you know coming off the loss you work on different things to try to try to get better um so yeah i don't want to say you know i have a certain percent chance but i think it could go either way three two it's gonna be a good match i know that for sure yeah people doubted your your endurance uh until your match against vitalik
SPEAKER_04: And you used the same strategy against Hermes, but unlike Vitalii, he had the shoulder pressure finishing because he was also struggling. If he didn't know how to do that or if he was not strong enough to do that, it seemed like he was also in trouble. He couldn't really go, but he was climbing up and he was able to press. And do you...
SPEAKER_00: what do you expect like what do you expect like what what would you like what's your concern about his hand is so strong um i usually have a pretty good a pretty decent decent hand but i know his hand is is really strong so my goal is to try to be able to you know get through his hand it's going to be going to be tough you know i'll have to adjust if i can't get through it but uh you know obviously you got uh
SPEAKER_00: plan B plan C, if that doesn't work. So yeah, I think I think trying to be able to get through his hand is going to be the key because he's so strong up top. And then we'll go from there after that. I have a question, you know, in the past, you were more like risker and dragging the opponent like side pressure mostly and then later, a few times,
SPEAKER_04: like some of your opponents topple you. So you started to develop the pronated side pressure instead of full wrist curve. But it seemed like it caused you to lose some hook strength after this. Or is it because injury or is it because you didn't use so much
SPEAKER_04: depending on your pronated once you turn this way maybe you know i know that my arm also wants to turn this way doesn't want to go that way so much like lately are you working both in and out or you still depending on outside i think it's a mixture of both uh some injuries have caused some some issues uh with the hook and like you said from switching switching moves
SPEAKER_00: I kind of depended on that a little bit more. I've been trying to work. You'll go back to the hook a little bit in case I need to. Sometimes I get out of position, and that's a problem too. If you're trying to top roll and then you end up out of position, you're trying to hook. For me, it's kind of difficult. I got to work on transitioning and coming back. So I'm working on that too. So it's a mixture of all those different types of things, basically. Yeah. Do you find Revaz versatile?
SPEAKER_04: I asked this because mainly he's a top roller, but when Morozo hooked him, he gave hell to Morozo, if you remember. Yeah, round one, he was just like, Morozo was out of a bloody battle. His face and his eyes were popping out. And we also saw him fighting against Michael with a dead wrist. So he can top roll, his hook is not bad, he can do a dead wrist.
SPEAKER_00: like you are prepared for everything. I know a hundred percent. He's so versatile. I'm just saying, I think his, his main move is his hand. I'm not saying he's, he's definitely, he's strong in the hook. He's strong when he got a flop or dead risks like that. So I wasn't saying we're taking anything away from, you know, his powers and other, in other areas. I was just saying, you know, the main move I have to worry about is his hand. So I'll be, I'll be ready for, you know, whatever he's done for sure.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Roman, can you also ask Revaz, what is his biggest concern about Dave? Is there side pressure? I will ask, but may I also kind of briefly tell what Dave has last year? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Revaz,
SPEAKER_03: That's why I'm telling you that no matter how you look at it, no matter what kind of technique you use, no matter what you do, no matter what you do, no matter what you do, no matter what you do, no matter what you do, no matter what you do,
SPEAKER_03: You said that there is a lot of pressure on the side. What do you think is the most important thing for all of us? What do you think is the most important thing for all of us? What do you think is the most important thing for all of us? First of all, it depends on the situation. First of all, it depends on the situation. First of all, it depends on the situation. First of all, it depends on the situation. First of all, it depends on the situation.
SPEAKER_01: . . . . .
SPEAKER_03: yeah they basically he said that we I expect both of us to go every time outside from top like top floor inside because uh we that's our both uh from both of us perspective neither would like to go in hook because that's better for us to go outside and he expecting it to be about endurance uh the wrist shoulder basically it could be also tough battle yeah he's saying yeah yeah and can you also ask him
SPEAKER_04: Like it was so hard to get a word from his mouth till today. And he suddenly started to talk a lot. How this happened? Because he started to feel comfortable or he realized that in professional business, you know, he needs to be more active. Just come in a second. All right.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it's not that I don't like it, it's just that in the show business, there's always a problem. It's always the same. It's always the same, right? It's always the same. It's always the same. It's always the same. It's always the same. It's always the same. It's always the same. It's always the same. It's always the same. It's always the same. It's always the same.
SPEAKER_03: So basically, it's one year since he's come back. He's saying thank you for the compliment. He took it as a compliment when I translated it. Yes, yes, yes. He feels more comfortable there. And he said that, yeah, I mean, time has come also to also
SPEAKER_04: try to talk, you know, uh, not only just, uh, uh, yeah. Yeah. And don't be, don't be like, only boom, boom. I love great guy, but he just wins. He is the winning machine, but he doesn't talk. He doesn't share pictures. He doesn't share anything, but it's okay. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: and uh he said uh that since it's been one year since he actually came back uh because of east versus west and uh obviously he's thankful uh he said that since then i have never stopped actually i'm really training training training because before that one he had a huge pause after so many years and now it's been one year constantly and i'm
SPEAKER_03: He hasn't been this shape right now. He's in his best shape. First time we asked, he said 40%, then he said 60%, and then he said 80%. What's he now? Best ever shape of his life? I will ask you.
SPEAKER_04: let's go to the let's go to the the predictions about the uh event let's start uh maybe i don't know if if dave knows everyone but they you know doug
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I know Doug. Yep. And, you know, his opponent, do you know Daniel Prokopchuk? Yeah, Daniel is tough. He's so good. It's going to be a great match. Yeah. 100% in Doug's corner. I'm looking forward to watching that match. I'm going with Doug in the upset. Yeah. Douglas is bigger guy. Bigger guy. Yeah. And strong as well. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And so you are saying that you will be supporting your countrymen, but it's going to be a good match, tough match. I do. I've watched Daniel. I've known Doug for years. He came up to Erie probably six, seven years ago to pull at my event. Great guy. He's so strong.
SPEAKER_00: I know Daniel, I mean, world class competitor. He's been, you know, on top for quite a few years. Uh, so yeah, it's going to be, it's going to be a good one. And it's going to be a huge win when Doug pulls this off. Yeah. Yeah. And can you ask Joe, uh, the same thing? Uh, uh,
SPEAKER_01: He was a coach at the time, and that's how he came to the US. But he was a good guy, right? Yes, he was. And he was a great guy. Yes, he was a great guy. He was a great guy.
SPEAKER_01: What I do, what I eat, what I drink, what I eat, what I eat, what I drink, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat, what I eat,
SPEAKER_01: So he said that, I know Daniel, but unfortunately I'm not familiar with Doug, Doug Erlich.
SPEAKER_03: So and I tried to explain and he he now he recognizes which guy we're talking about, but he still doesn't have enough information to conduct some predictions in details. He just basically said was talking about the culture. He said that lately I noticed that he is in good shape, also doing quite a good top role. And I admit, like I said about that.
SPEAKER_04: Samushia versus Daniel when Daniel also went outside. It was a good match, especially earlier rounds, yeah. Yeah, and he thinks that because he knows how good Daniel is, kind of favorite is Daniel for him right now. Okay, that is a super chat quickly. I want to read Robert Gold. Thank you, my friend. Engin, how many title defenses does it take before you receive the battle axe? My friend, before I was saying that one needs to win three title matches to win those things.
SPEAKER_04: But now I decided that for every title match for the level, I will give something permanently. Like for example, Davit Samushia won one title match, he won the shield. The second one, he get the helmet and he will automatically get the battle ax automatically because he won already three times. And if he wins the next one, he will get the, how do you say that?
SPEAKER_04: uh what do you say that the warriors were putting on their body you know like you know like armor armor yeah armor i'm gonna give armor and they will be the best one if david wins and if if if brandon wins he's gonna get the shield yeah yeah so so what i'm just saying that for every title win
SPEAKER_04: they they they will get something permanently they will get something permanently yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: Engin, quickly, he asked about what you said, and in the middle of your speaking, I also briefly told him, and then he asked, when time comes, I want also something like this armor you were talking about, Engin. Will you have my size? No, I will get for any size. Devon't worry. Just go win there. I will give you even more. Just win. Because your category...
SPEAKER_04: The super heavyweight category has never been like this. Your super heavyweight category is now like hell, you know, just like, look, just, just think about the guys. Levan there, Zaur there, Hermes is there, Jerry is there, Dave Sheffield is there, Revaz there, Genadi is there, Devon there, Laletin is there. Like, it is just like a nightmare, you know, the category, you know, just, yeah, just tell him to not to worry about it. I will give him anything he wants, just, just let him win, you know.
SPEAKER_04: in the past it was one of the weakest competition there was only a few guys now the super heavyweight category we still forget arif alex burdecha many others you know so we will see mission borosso
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah come on man the reason i didn't mention because there are too many you are missing someone you're forgetting you know yeah yeah people say i have good memory but not that good you know um arm karma would love to see dave hermes again where dave doesn't redline couple weeks before it was in couple weeks it was uh a month yeah uh noticed yeah also please put revas in car for press conference
SPEAKER_04: So he has max energy. Yes. You know, tell him, tell him, thank you for your simple shit. Tell him that, you know, because it's a press conference, you know, Revaz is usually sleeping. And they say that he should join from the car so that he would have more energy. That's a good one, man. That's a good one.
SPEAKER_03: There is another super chat. Thank you, my friend. My friend, sorry that last time I didn't see your super chat, my friend.
SPEAKER_04: uh i was closing it was like last 10 15 seconds probably you said silky wilkie thank you for your support you will get crushed by dave not many know this but dave's hit is so unrelenting because of the sheer mass of his swinging balls under the table acting as an unstoppable counterweight how do you how do you come to my friends
SPEAKER_03: translate if you can uh so i was i was actually uh he was talking about which one is this lalette is it a truck driver guy and that's why i was laughing so he got me distracted what should i tell you what's that i don't understand you're laughing at the same time because ray was was asking me like who is this lalette and you see a truck driver guy or something that's why and i kind of missed what you wanted me to tell you
SPEAKER_03: Translate, and then we can continue the matches. .
SPEAKER_03: . . . . .
SPEAKER_04: i don't know i don't want to wait i don't want to wait to go somewhere else you know like dressed you know yeah it's just a separate way so let's go to the next match um rob vision jr drop dave oh man that's that's a tough one uh i mean you need to be the top one to become the best
SPEAKER_00: global reality check zurab has a ton of experience east versus west um so i would give him the a little bit of the edge uh i think it's going to be a hook obviously a hook war um but robin i don't know rob has a hand um he might pull that out and if he does zurab could be in trouble obviously rooting for rob so we'll see how do you see that rob is top rolling i think i think rob rob
SPEAKER_00: he loves the hook but he's got a hand he's got a great hand a big hand especially for his size i think he can take i think he can take zurab's hand and definitely surprise him so i think rob i think rob 100 what what if it goes inside uh that's a tough one that could go either way too zurab's very strong inside i would give i would give zurab the little bit of an edge inside but maybe not i mean rob hasn't pulled in a while
SPEAKER_00: i've been probably at least a year i think he pulled uh was it sasho i believe the last time i seen him it was a little bit ago um but uh i think i would give zurab the edge inside rob the edge outside i understand and uh what does ray was saying
SPEAKER_01: He's American, isn't he? Yes, he's American. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: He was a very good player. He was a very good player. In AMC, right? Yes, he was a very good player. He was a very good player. He was a very good player. He was a very good player. He was a very good player. He was a very good player. He was a very good player.
SPEAKER_01: If you want to do something, you can do it, but if you don't want to do it, you can't do it. But I think there is a solution.
SPEAKER_01: In the 3rd and 2nd months, there is a lot of moving games. Because if you do this, you will have a lot of opportunities. You will have a lot of opportunities. You will have a lot of opportunities. You will have a lot of opportunities. You will have a lot of opportunities. You will have a lot of opportunities.
SPEAKER_03: So he said that he knows RVJ and he knows how he was proven against all touchings as well. So if we count the fact that Zurab had also
SPEAKER_03: competed AMC recently, this tournament, which everyone said that Zurab was pulling not only strong, but also smart there as well. He really liked how Zurab won the competition.
SPEAKER_03: He said that if we count that, I think Revaz thinks that that may be a kind of a factor that may held Revaz Zurab back to compete at his 100% because of the time, how close it is, like one month or so is to the East versus West event.
SPEAKER_03: he still said 60 to 40 surab would win because rvj is coming from also from the uh long pause but he he is kind of afraid that zura will be zuro's performance will be influenced because of this tournament which was one month before which will be one month before this uh event so yeah but i understand dave a quick question then we will continue who is the king of the north america
SPEAKER_00: Who is the king of North America? Yeah. I'm going to keep that thought to myself. You're going to keep that? I'm going to keep that thought to myself. You're going to keep that thought to yourself? Yeah. I'm not going to share the idea. Oh, okay. What is that? You know, I'm a quiet guy, so I don't like to, you know,
SPEAKER_00: You know, we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens down the road. There's a few, there's a few, there's a few things that, you know, probably in the works down here, we'll see what happens to you with real King, King of the North. This is him. I know. Do you agree with that? Do I agree? I don't agree with that. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: You don't agree with that behalf of yourself or someone else? There's a lot of guys that could be named, you know, King of North America. It'd be nice to get us all on the table and see, you know, once and for all, who is actual, you know, the best of the best on the North America. But there's a few guys that, you know, could go too. So, yeah, Devon certainly has a claim. Absolutely. He definitely has a claim for it, as do many other people. So, yeah. But you disagree with him, right?
SPEAKER_04: You're trying to stir the pot again. I see what you're doing. Come on. That's how the things start, Dave. That's how the things start. I know. Because we need to settle it. We need to settle it. Because we don't know. It'll be settled. It'll be settled. Okay. Okay. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. Okay. Let's go to the next one.
SPEAKER_04: Alizhan Muratov and Kody Merritt. Dave you seen Alizhan Muratov? The Kazakh guy. I've seen him a little, but he's ridiculous. He's so good. His left is so good. 210 pounds. What does he weigh? That's all he weighs? 110 pounds. And he won the One Force Superweight. That's insane. And then he beat Oleg Petrenko, who was 22 pounds heavier than him.
SPEAKER_00: the title 105 title match yeah yeah cody oh man i love cody cody's so strong north america he's awesome but this dude's uh anything can happen it can go it can happen and go either way um i think cody's a little bit of the underdog um i'm looking forward to i would never count him out of anything i'll never so yeah he said he's training very good he says he's training very good yeah
SPEAKER_04: He thinks Kody will win. Kody will win? Yeah, he thinks so. He said, I'm not going to say much else. I think Kody will win. I understand. Yeah. And Adam Wozniacki, Bacho Bacho Saginashvili. Let's start with Revaz. Since he knows Adam and Bacho well, Dave doesn't know much about Bacho.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes, I know, I know. He was a very good person. He was a very good person. He was a very good person. He was a very good person. He was a very good person. He was a very good person. He was a very good person. He was a very good person. He was a very good person.
SPEAKER_01: He was a very nice person, and he was very kind to those who were in need. But I think that I was the one who had to leave the monastery, because I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what to do. You didn't know what to do, did you? No, I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to do.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_01: He said that he knows Adam, he knows how strong he is, especially considering how he handled match against Bozo.
SPEAKER_03: And then he said, but however, on the other side, we have Bacho here. He knows Bacho through the videos only because Bacho's current form through the videos only. Because last time he saw Bacho was so young during the competition. He did not specify any time, but I believe it's the same time when you also saw Bacho when he was 14 or so. And basically he was saying that Bacho looks impressive, but he thinks that it's kind of young.
SPEAKER_03: he's kind of still young to compete on such a tournament. And he was saying, is he 17 or something? I told him he's 18. He already told us. So basically he thinks Bacho is kind of young, but obviously he roots for him. He wishes he would tell everything necessary on the competition to beat Adam. But I mean, right now he cannot say who would win in this case. And Dave, you know, this guy is a young guy, 18 years old.
SPEAKER_04: from georgia and georgians are talking very highly about him i saw him when he was 14 years old he competed under 15 years old category 12 at the side table he was beating the senior guys when he was 14 now the guy is 18 years old and he's gonna pull adam warsinski he's so confident of himself about winning
SPEAKER_04: And how do you see that? Do you think it's possible an 18 years old guy that never have really international experience to just to come and be someone like Adam? That's pretty impressive for him to be able to do that. Obviously, you know what you're doing with the matchmaking and you put this match together for a reason.
SPEAKER_00: So I feel if you feel that he can make it a great match and come out of victory, I feel that. They call me, I didn't know anything about it. It's possible, you know, so there must be a reason. I don't know much about him, so I'm going with Adam for the win, but obviously, you know, in your head, you're thinking there must be a reason. There's a hundred percent reason. I'm just seeing there is a possibility, but I don't know what they expect. And there is a super set for you. Uh, chess goals. Um, how does they feel?
SPEAKER_00: would do in a match against dennis if it happened tomorrow and what about in six months time thank you dennis i would love to i would love to pull dennis again that would be awesome we had such great wars you know 10 years ago eight nine ten years ago and that's lottie and at the a1 it was
SPEAKER_00: Some of my best matches ever. Yeah, unforgettable. I would love to pull tomorrow or six months from now, tomorrow. I would love to pull Dennis again. I would love it. Yeah, it would be great, yeah. And then let's go to the next one. Arif Ertem, Dzeranov. Revaz. Rezo, how about? Arif Dzeranov. Oh, that's interesting. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Giorgis is also in a different form. You can find him on Instagram, if you want to follow him. And, well, I think it's time to say goodbye.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what to say. I think it's a very good thing.
SPEAKER_01: And if there is a bad shape in the biceps, there is nothing to worry about, because I have a good biceps. And Minahia said that the shape of the biceps is very thin. She is a thin teacher, and she knows very well that there is something wrong with the biceps. From that point of view, I think that Dzeranov did not do anything wrong, and that is why he did not lose weight.
SPEAKER_03: He's thinking that Arif is favorite and Arif will win. He thinks that if it's Arif going to be top row, Georgii Dzeranov.
SPEAKER_03: Even though Georgii is also preparing very strong, he knows that. He says that getting inside the hook against Arif is kind of awful for you if you try to hook Arif and beat him. And he reminisced about some athletes that during WAFs tried to hook Arif and Arif just knows how to block the angles and just top rolls if you try to hook him. So he's saying that Arif is going to be just top rolling Georgii.
SPEAKER_00: And that's why he thinks it's favorite. Dave, do you know both guys? I don't know. The guy that pulled Kalinyshenko and Wagner Bortolaccio. I don't really know him too well. I know Arif, obviously, is looking strong, super strong. So, I mean, I don't know much about the other guys. So, I have to go with Arif. He just looks great lately. Huge, strong, powerful, great hand. So, I would pick him. You go with Arif. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Then let's go with the Brandon versus Samushia, Dave. I got to go with Brandon. You know, I used to train with Brandon all the time. He's getting better and better. He trains harder than most people. He loves arm wrestling. He's loved it since, you know, day one. So I got to go with Brandon. He's got a lot of heart. How do you see him beating Samushia, top rolling him?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think so. I was going to go outside and leave. Do you know Brandon? Davit is like
SPEAKER_03: he needs he needs to like switch the right mode and once he switches that during this match whenever round it is after that he's raging mode he's just beating everybody he said yeah so he's saying okay go ahead he's saying that that would be um does she think that anyone on this earth can beat uh david or david is too much for 85 kilo
SPEAKER_04: Okay, then let's go to the next one. Pauline versus Sasho, Dave. Paul, 100%. Paul, 100% he's going to win? I think it's going to be a great match. I think Paul will beat him. I really do. Yeah, he's got
SPEAKER_00: He's got so much horsepower. He's confident. Uh, he's got the momentum. Um, he's looked great lately. So, I mean, until he, until someone takes him down, I'm going with Paul. Did you, did you guys have chance lately to train together or? No, we tried, we tried to get together. It's hard with my work schedule and his work schedule. Cause I, I trained during the week. Cause my days off are, you know, Thursday, Friday, and then, you know, I have my, my son certain days.
SPEAKER_00: it's hard for me to get certain places when you know because i work on the weekends and he doesn't work on the weekends it's just difficult we've tried to plan something but it just never came to so hopefully hopefully maybe the next time or sometime soon we get together and train but how hard to do that before the competition when we are like three weeks ago three weeks away i probably only have one more
SPEAKER_01: I'll probably pull this Wednesday coming up or Thursday and then I'll rest the rest of the time. I like to take two, two and a half weeks off before I pull. So yeah, that'll be it for me. And Ravash? I think it's all good because I've been doing this for a long time. I've been doing this for a long time. I've been doing this for a long time. I've been doing this for a long time.
SPEAKER_01: He is thinking Pauline will take this one.
SPEAKER_03: pulling Babaev in hook. I mean, first two rounds, it was not good for Bolin, but we saw how much he could have done against Babaev, and that's still impressive. And he thinks that, obviously, we know how good he is, but judging by the performance, what Bolin delivered last time, and all these things that all this time has not been around, he thinks Bolin will take this one.
SPEAKER_04: That's interesting. That is expected to hear from Dave, but from an Eastern guy to think Paul is winning, it is unexpected. He's objective. Because most of the people are thinking Bacho is heavily favored. I also think that that match can go either way. Paul is, because he's a super nice guy, probably people don't realize
SPEAKER_00: How dangerous it can be at the table. This is what I think. And then let's go to the Laletin versus Tobias. Left arm, Dave. I think the Laletin's left isn't quite as good as his right. I don't believe so. But I think Vitalii will win. I think it's going to be a good match. Tobias, he's young, great.
SPEAKER_00: He's looked solid every time I've seen him pull. I think Laletin will win. I don't think it's going to be a walk in the park or anything like that. I think it'll be a good match, but I think Vitalii will win. I understand. Up top, yeah. What's that? It's going to go up top, yeah. Oh, okay. I understand, yeah. And Rivas?
SPEAKER_01: He thinks that Laletin will win. He also thinks that Laletin will win on left hand. Is it going to be any cross or dominance?
SPEAKER_03: Do you think he will dominate or will he win? No, he will win. Tobias won't win, but I think he will win. Eventually, I think we will win, but it will be a close match. He thinks that Tobias is somewhere right there, but I think he will be victorious. Okay, last three matches. Dave, who is going to win? Dave Chaffee or Revaz Zvukidze?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm rooting for myself in this one, surprisingly. You know, I hope to come out on top. Like I said, I think it's going to be a war, 3-2. I have so much respect for him. He's like me. He's quiet. He's a good sportsman on the table. I love people like that. Those are the type of people I respect in this sport, 100%. So, I think it's going to be a good match, and hopefully I can come out on top. Looking forward to it. Yeah. And then, Roaz? Thanks, Fawad. Thank you. I'm going to go now. I'm going to go now.
SPEAKER_00: Let's go to the last two matches. Irakli vs. Ongarbaev, Dave. I think that's the most exciting match, the one I'm looking forward to the most.
SPEAKER_00: It's going to be a war. I feel I feel. Iraq can stay in the match. I think I was going to win it, though. I really do. He's just looked so good against John, against Mike. Not that Iraq didn't look good against everybody he's pulled. But I think I think I was going to win. It's going to be a war going to be. Probably all five matches, but I think I'm going to win.
SPEAKER_04: Where do you rank Ongarbaev technically and table IQ, everything? Say that again? Like, where do you rank? Do you rank him highly, Ongarbaev, about table IQ, about technical abilities, about explosiveness, endurance? For me, I say just every program to everyone. But after I saw him against Michael,
SPEAKER_00: Like the guy was just like, I mean, I can't think anything superior than what I saw that night, you know. Super, super impressive. You know, anything, 9, 5, 10, like everything is just incredible to watch him. What do you think against Michael? Just, you know, the counters and the moves and just waiting everything out. And he doesn't look like monstrous. He looks just like a normal guy. Chess player.
SPEAKER_04: yeah it's like this guy's gonna you have no idea he's gonna kill you it's crazy yeah yeah and then even at the table he doesn't show no emotion all the time he's just thinking more than fighting you know like he's all the time just like i don't know that that guy is unique you know this just and i think that iraqi is stronger than him horsepower i i think iraq has more horsepower he needs to dominate on garber to win
SPEAKER_04: If it somehow goes to the technical battle, chess game or something, it is hard to beat the guy, but we will see, you know, we will see. I'm not saying Irakli can. There is a possibility Irakli will dominate him. Who knows? Yeah, you never know. But that's the match I'm looking forward to the most, for sure. Yeah, that's good. And Revaz? Ongar Bayevi?
SPEAKER_01: Well, that's how it is. My favorite thing is to work hard, to work hard. That's how it is. And the most important thing is to do everything you can. That's how it is. But, of course,
SPEAKER_01: It's our fate, it's in our hands, and it's up to us to decide what to do with it. I don't know what to do with it, but the first thing to do is to think about it, and the second thing is to decide what to do with it. The first thing to do is to think about it, and the second thing is to think about it.
SPEAKER_01: I think that's the only way to do it, because... I think that's the only way to do it, because... I think that's the only way to do it, because... I think that's the only way to do it, because... I think that's the only way to do it, because...
SPEAKER_03: uh personally his favorite like just outside of this match his favorite armwrestler one of the favorite armwrestlers because of the way he pulls the way he uses his knowledge and experience and uh like um table iq uh yeah but uh if it goes to the uh
SPEAKER_03: outside game which he expects it gonna be he thinks roughly is strong enough in that movement to overcome uh other than that he he was kept kept saying like it is extremely hard for for us right now to kind of give some good prediction once they do the first round we will see who yeah when the matches are so close
SPEAKER_04: I mean, it's hard to predict what will happen when Ford goes outside, who is at risk, will survive. Yeah, it's so hard to gauge. Yeah, he understood what you're saying. Yeah, yeah. And yeah, okay. So let's go to Dave. There is a super chat for you. Before I ask the last match, Maked Donek asked Dave if he would beat Devon right now.
SPEAKER_00: in an East versus West format and how? This time I'm not stealing the port. This is Super Jeff. Sure you're not. I think, once again, that'd be a good match. I would love to pull Devon in a standout match where he doesn't, you know, lay down under the table. I think a different format, such as East versus West, it would go a little differently. And I look forward to the chance, hopefully, down the road to, you know,
SPEAKER_04: have another shot at pulling him. So yeah, I think it will go differently for sure. I understand, thank you. And the last match, Devon versus Genadi, Dave. I think Devon will win. Before you say something, Genadi is also coming at his best ever shape. You also would know that anyone who is pulling against Devon is having
SPEAKER_04: the opportunity of his life, because you're pulling Devon Larratt. This is the most famous guy in the world, one of the best pullers ever. And so Genadi is coming like he has never been. I am sure Devon is also coming at his best, maybe even better shape than he pulled against Levan. So I just want you to continue. Yeah, I know Genadi, he'll be ready and I know he's prepared.
SPEAKER_00: I think Devon will come out on top. It just depends on Genadi. Devon will, you know, like he always does, he'll go to his little like King's Move thing to try to wear the guy out immediately. Genadi looked great when Michael did it to him. He obviously studied it and knew exactly what to do. Now Devon's is a little bit different than Michael's.
SPEAKER_00: I think if he can wait it out, he does have a chance. But I think Devon just, I think he's got too much endurance. He's too smart on the table. And I think that Genadi will wear out and then eventually Devon will just come out on top. That's my prediction. I understand. And Ravas? This is the result of two games. There are two games. And Galia will win. Didi Galia and Shekhar will be in the second place.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that this match is like two crazy guys, just two crazy entities are going at each other. So the best would be to just throw them in the cage and just watch. In the cage, just let them fight. And his training partner with Genadi,
SPEAKER_04: Can he tell us something about Genadi's psychology about this match? Is he pretending or is he really crazy that as much as he tells or does he even hold more to himself than showing to us? All right.
SPEAKER_03: Rezo, we've been talking for a while now about how Genadi is doing, and you've been saying that you've been training with Genadi for a while now. Do you know what happens when he's in a bad shape, and you tell him what to do and what not to do? It's a lot of fun, isn't it? You know what I mean, right? You can go to the gym every day, and you'll be able to do it every day. No, no, no, I can do it. I can do it every day.
SPEAKER_01: No, he actually admitted that he said that Genadi is really well prepared right now. He's preparing at his best. He's really that much focused.
SPEAKER_03: deliver and that much focus to beat devil whatever he shows throughout the social media and he believes that uh gennady is very well capable to do that yeah okay another thing i'm gonna ask before we finish does he think that we need to bring their uh security
SPEAKER_03: He's asking like these specific regards for specific person or just in general there.
SPEAKER_04: no no because again again again when he said about the devil right yeah yeah and said that he will need some people to protect him i i hope he's joking but you know when he's again you can never be sure of course i'm gonna have a private private uh talk with the guys but you know i hope it is not really because we are at this we are friends we're gonna arm muscle
SPEAKER_04: we can just go back and forth and the match finish, we hug each other, we eat together, we laugh together, and then we go home, you know, but just probably he was, Genadi was joking, right? Yeah, before I ask Rebos, I just want to remind people, your viewers and our viewers all around the world,
SPEAKER_03: When Genadi said that I was the translator, I would repeat myself. He said that during this press conference, it's going to be better for Devon not to cross the lines too much during this exchange of trash talking and stuff, or else there will be necessity of the bodyguards. That's what Genadi said. So not necessarily he's going to go through with it, but if he provokes something too much. Yeah, but Devon is going to do that. I mean, it's up to Devon then.
SPEAKER_03: No, I cannot go like, you know, he's off to Devon or something. I need to talk with them. There is nothing, you know, we are arm wrestlers. Ask Reozo. Reozo, I know that many of you have heard about Devon during the press conference, but I would like to ask you, why did you choose him?
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, I don't think so. I think it's a good idea, because Devon is a great Sultan, and I think he's a great man, and I think he's a great man.
SPEAKER_03: he's saying that well i didn't expect that he's saying that no actually it's gonna be vice versa because okay first stop laughing then say i don't understand what he said so he said that
SPEAKER_03: uh no it's it's not gonna be uh they were not gonna be the one who needs uh bodyguards because judging by the uh last time when uh rivers saw devon with jody he knows what jody is capable of so it's gonna be angry because if jody can come with devil there yeah yeah i i i think jody is gonna come but she may not be on the stage i don't know yeah
SPEAKER_03: Or yeah, anyway, so. So if Devon will be alone there without Kody, then yeah. But if Kody is there, then Genadi is in trouble. Anyways, yeah, okay. Okay, Dave, my friend, thank you. Okay, one last thing I want to ask you. If Morozov just say,
SPEAKER_04: 40%, he says that he will be 50%. I don't know how. Stronger. This is a young guy, you know, and he pulls every two and a half months nonstop. If he is like that much stronger than the time that he pulled against Rivas, may he have any chance against Levan? I think eventually he will. Is there a date set? Are they pulling like a certain date? July 29th. Oh, they are?
SPEAKER_04: three and a half months later and the guy is he was 130 kilo now he's 140 kilo and he's planning to be very near 330 and the guy is just your muscle i don't know if you've seen his recent pictures yeah i think i think that it's a little too early personally i think yeah i think down the road 100 i do believe
SPEAKER_00: can definitely get there and and will but just my opinion i think it's just a little bit too around okay but just because it's just too early doesn't mean that he has zero chance in your opinion oh no no definitely not there's always a chance anything can happen you know you know you know how it goes okay but but you are saying that if he had more time then his chance would be higher
SPEAKER_04: what you are saying absolutely yes absolutely and does he after you know his performances does he deserve this shot against leon because people says that oh why levan pulls once a year why he doesn't put more often and then when you set him a match they are like oh why did you set this guy why you put hermes he needs two more years why you said morozo
SPEAKER_00: If Hermes, Morozov, this type of guys are not pulling against Levant, who should I bring? Bring someone from Jupiter or something? These are the best guys. Yeah, he's going to run out of people to pull. You have to pull somebody. And Levant, he's the champ. He doesn't have to pull every week, every month. He can pull once a year. He's earned that right. That's just my opinion. And you've got to give the guys a shot to pull them or you're going to run out of people anyways. And how about Jerry versus Hermes?
SPEAKER_00: That'll be a good one, I think. I have a question for you. How is your, do you think that your dead risk pressure is as effective as Jerry's or just because you are new at it, Jerry may be more experienced than you are? I think Jerry's is more experienced. He's been doing that for his entire career. It's something new to me. I got to work on some things with that. That's his go-to thing. That's my, you know,
SPEAKER_00: second, third thing in the arsenal now. So I think Jerry's is a little more effective. But Ermias showed me that he can definitely combat that very well, getting on top of that hand like he did against me. And I think he does that against Jerry. Jerry's in trouble. Okay. Okay. I understand. So you are giving edge to Ermias? I would give a little. I'm not saying Jerry can't win the match because he can. But I think Ermias has the edge, yes. Okay. I understand.
SPEAKER_04: And can you ask the same two questions? Very shortly, I want the answers, we are closing. Does, if Morozov is just say like 30% stronger than, he said that he's already stronger than the time he pulled against Revaz, would he have any chance against Levan or not at all? Revaz, as I said, Sheryl Morozov and Mac Pormis Morozov, they are both strong, but if you look at Levan, they are 30% stronger.
SPEAKER_01: Is there any chance that Morozov will be reelected? I don't know. I don't think so. I think Morozov will be reelected. In this case, Morozov is 20% reelected.
SPEAKER_01: This is the case, and it is possible to say that it is possible. Levan is worried about the fact that he does not have enough resources. Gasparin was 18-12 kg, and it is possible to say that he will lose weight this month. I don't know what to say, but I think Gasparin will lose weight.
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that in that version, like you said, again, that version of Morozov,
SPEAKER_03: he's gonna be really mentally also doing right steps during these rounds and matches yeah uh he's saying that even that case morozov will have a big chance and even bigger chance than leon so he says that that version of morozov doing right things during the pool pool against leon would beat leon
SPEAKER_04: if he gets like 30, 40% chance and he does everything right, and then he thinks that there is a chance that Morozov can beat Levan. Yeah, in that case, Morozov's chances will be more than Levan's chances. Okay, okay. So he's, even as a Georgii, he's objective about this and he's saying that, you know, yeah, I understand. Anyway, thanks to...
SPEAKER_03: He asked what you said. Can I briefly just translate what you? So basically, he's saying the same.
SPEAKER_04: Because if Levan doesn't, this version of Levan that we see today against 30-40% Morozov, yeah. Okay, the Levan we saw in Dubai and then 30-40% stronger Morozov, Morozov would have higher chance. This is what he said basically. Okay. Hey, thank you for your time, my friend.

SPEAKER_03: He's also saying big thanks to you, Engin, that he gave him a chance to be today with us and also to call against Dave.
