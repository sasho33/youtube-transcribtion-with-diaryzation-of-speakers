SPEAKER_02: Where are you from? And just tell us about you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am actually, my name is Adnan, as you probably can see. I'm from a country called Jordan, which is an Arab country in the Middle East. Yeah. I started to watch arm wrestling, I think, late 2015, early. Oh, so here is the legend. Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
SPEAKER_02: I started watching armwrestling in the beginning. I was kind of ashamed because it's not so much of a popular sport here. But I think during COVID and a bit before, it exploded for me. And I started to invite everybody. I started to watch it every, every, every day. And honestly, I'm not a big sports fan other than strength sports. But easily, armwrestling is my favorite sport. Hello, everyone. Good to see you.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, Ron. Hello, my friend. Hey, guys. How are you? Good to see you. How are you? Is it possible to turn the camera sideways or no? Yep, yep. That better? That East versus West 2 t-shirt on you. Wow, that looks good. Yeah, I got to promote you, man. I'm going to be on your show. Got to wear that. So how are you doing?
SPEAKER_02: professional guy you know i'm okay i'm trying to you know serve the sport and as you know and i appreciate your support all the time i see and yeah yeah you are you are one of those legends that i look up uh from my early years and seriously um your support and your opinions uh very important for me my friend
SPEAKER_00: and i'm very glad yeah i'm very glad to uh host you here in this show and hopefully in july right july that would work for me yeah it'll work for me in july yeah it's only if i can bring somebody with me but yeah we we decided if you invite me i'm going no matter what i gotta yeah
SPEAKER_02: you know that you know that you know that you are always welcome if you didn't come here more than once you know that you were not available you know that many times yeah i knew why did you but it was your work it was your injury or this and that many times you know and now it was so yeah and remember you had the best match up to this date i wouldn't believe it yeah i would yeah i wish i could i got the win but hey you can't win them all
SPEAKER_02: i mean i don't think there was any winner at least i don't think there was anyone who lost it that match you know yeah it was a great match that's one that's one where i didn't get the win but i didn't feel bad about it i know i gave it all on the table so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and and and matt you talk you tell us you you are joining from germany right
SPEAKER_01: Yes, Engin, I live in Germany, yes. Yeah, I'll just introduce myself. So most of you guys probably know me as Lagia, the guy who comments everywhere, you know. Yeah, actually, I started watching armwrestling in, I believe, 2017 or 18, you know, somewhere in that timeframe. Believe it or not, the first video I watched of armwrestling was actually nothing Devon Larratt or John Rezang related.
SPEAKER_01: It was a match between, uh, Craig Thule and, uh, Quinlan Mendez, which is kind of surprising because they're not so well known, but, um, yeah, it wasn't WAL. Um, I believe it was like a best of three format, I think. And at one point it was 1-0, uh, 1-1 and then Quinlan fouled out, which would be the overall win for Craig. But then Craig said, um, no, I don't want to win on fouls and they pulled again.
SPEAKER_01: then craig lost but he kind of looked happy and more satisfied to boost through arm wrestling instead of win through fouls looks like that behavior inspired you yeah that really fascinated me because before that of course uh like everyone else we just knew arm wrestling like this and that i mean it's not real arm wrestling you know so i didn't i had no idea that um arm wrestling was a real sport and that really fascinated me that such a situation can uh
SPEAKER_01: or curates you know arm wrestling like what is arm wrestling i had no idea back then and uh from then on i just started watching wal like at that time only wal but um yeah i just it just clicked pretty much immediately and uh then there it became my favorites like immediately for a while and then um yeah but it it didn't really like super click like i became obsessed when
SPEAKER_01: actually, when East versus West won, I was really surprised how much I enjoyed an event because it was like more purist, you know, the rules were more strict and the guys were not very well known, maybe apart from Matt Mask and Hermes Gasparini, who back then I really started to like. And then East versus West 2 came and then I became like a super obsessed fan. And that's basically my journey as a fan. So thank you, Engin, really for these events. That's
SPEAKER_02: My friend, I thank you guys. I thank you guys. I'm telling you. Over here, we have a Turkish saying that like the guy tells to the woman he loves, he says that your beauty wouldn't matter if I didn't have this love for you. You understand? So it is just like whatever we do, like how beautiful it is. Like if we didn't have you guys to follow,
SPEAKER_02: love and sports that we will, I mean, it wouldn't matter so much. So Ron, these days we have, I do that every day, almost every day, you know, I invite a popular, a legendary player like you, and then I invite those fans from social media. These guys are all the time watching us and writing comments like forever.
SPEAKER_02: So I thought that it would be a good idea to bring these guys to the legendary like yourself. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah, it is. It may be very important for them. You know, that is why. Yeah. And Ron, can you tell us how have you been yesterday when I announced that you're going to be my guest is somebody I remember he
SPEAKER_00: told me to ask you, what do you think about your match against Pablo? I think Monster Factory will be there, right? Yeah, yeah. It's at the Monster Factory. It's supposed to be 240 pounds, which I know I can make. Yeah, it'll be interesting because I've called Pablo two other times. About three years ago, we had a super match and I beat him right and left. And about 16, 17 months ago,
SPEAKER_00: He showed up at a tournament. He had a super match, but he was more at first he was upset because I wasn't pulling the tournament. Cause he wanted to pull me to get revenge. And so I joined in the tournament right-handed and I beat him both matches to win the title, but they were a lot tighter than they were before. So yeah, Mike called me with all the stuff that happened with the monster factory on some of his matches.
SPEAKER_00: um he called me and asked me if i wanted it initially he asked me or if i should give it to marcio and i said try marcio and he asked pablo and pablo goes no no several others and he goes how about ron bath and he had in capital letters y-e-s-s-s um i've watched him pulling up he he's pulling massive i mean i'm probably the underdog in this one again uh which you know when you look at all the factors he's 40 i'm 61
SPEAKER_00: Um, he is getting stronger. He's improving every year, but I, I'm not calling myself out. I think I know what it takes to beat him. Um, so yeah, I'll just have to be on fire. I haven't arm wrestled in a while, so I'm sort of hungry for it. Um, Angie's been here now for almost a year full and she, she works out the finer points of the game when we're at the gym, like all the wrist stuff and hand stuff, um, where normally I would just go do bicep curls and I'd go home.
SPEAKER_00: Um, so now I'm actually working out a little bit more arm wrestling oriented. Well, when I talked to Mike first time, I'll tell him when I first got in the sport, I did such a physical job. I never had to go to the gym. I never went, I didn't think of it. And then trying to get into the gym, uh, and actually working for the sport, it takes a little time and I'm slowly developing a little more habit to working on it.
SPEAKER_02: i think between the hunger and my workout partner and uh everything i i think i'll be ready for pablo but it's gonna be it's gonna be interesting it might it might turn out to be another uh uh brown bath yeah yeah just make sure we did the gym training that you know it may not be that easy to get used to so quickly just make sure that you don't lose what you already have and now add on it add on it you know because
SPEAKER_02: Sometimes when I remember John, a few times he tried like a total gym training and then he didn't, maybe you remember that he was saying that he didn't help him really good, you know? Yeah. So of course that, you know, it's your choice, but, but I will tell you something. You are, you are 61. You said I'm 48. You look much better than I do, my friend. You are, I would only dream to look like you when I'm 61. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: thank you and to go back on what you're talking about the gym training i totally agree not you can't just go to the gym and train to go to the gym i think is more for my personal fitness and keep me somewhat fit but you got to go home you got to work the tendons you got to work the pulling the technique um and that's the other thing i developed initially when i first got in the sport you know the technical part wasn't quite as savvy and i naturally was just a strong arm wrestler
SPEAKER_00: And I never really had to work on my technical game. And I wasn't, I guess, savvy enough to study it. Where now the last couple of years, I'm actually starting to watch and say, damn, maybe I should get a little farther, do this or do that different. So I think no matter how old we get, we can always learn a bit more of the technique. I might not get any stronger, but I can learn a little bit more about the angles that I never took advantage of before.
SPEAKER_02: And it will make you more effective and it will mean that you will perform stronger. It very much good. And we'll just have to see how that plays out. Yeah, but don't be like, don't be acting like you are not technical at all. You have almost as much as my age, you know, my life, you know. So, I mean, there is not nothing that you didn't experience, you know, during your career, you know. Yeah, true, true.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I've always had the technical, it's the finer points of the technicalities that you see people looking at nowadays. I have seen your point in almost every position, your top roll, your side press, your shoulder press, your hook, you know, you are one of the most versatile arm masters that I know. And Adnan, do you have any questions for Ron?
SPEAKER_02: I just want to say that I'm very happy to be here on this episode, especially hosted by Ingen, to chat with you, Ron. It is a real pleasure. Whenever you approach the table, I know the match will be a screamer. And I don't know if I can ask or something about if you have any ideas or maybe if you or Ingen have any...
SPEAKER_02: Let's say set matches or suggested matches in East versus West. I know your match with Pablo is upcoming, but if you are planning to come to East versus West, who are you planning to pull? I really can't tell you who I would be planning to pull because I don't study enough of them to make it a good match. And when I come to East versus West, I have so much trust in Engen.
SPEAKER_00: that he's going to match me against somebody that he thinks will be that'll make the best war not necessarily give me a win he wants to see the war sort of like my last match there so i don't even think about it i'm just going to wait to see who uh engen puts me against yeah but i will still i will still give you a few options and i will explain and i will just say that this guy this guy this guy all are almost same level as you are and then
SPEAKER_02: you choose because because like um it is kind of um against my personality to say that like this guy to you like or to john or to some other legends i would just say always like like i give options only you understand and then the legend chooses uh the one you know and and yeah matthew you have any question for run
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, for example, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you injured something at the Monster Factory. I think you were sparring with Michael Todd, Corey West. And honestly, I was just going to ask, are you fully recovered or do you have any major or minor concerns to her? Yeah, I tore my left bicep. I was pulling Corey West. And yeah, he's called a gorilla for a reason.
SPEAKER_00: And the thing is, he was somewhat broke down a little bit. Him and Mike had had some wars because normally straight up, Corey would probably just trash me left. But I managed to get a stop and I thought, maybe I'll try to get a little pronation on him. And he took me down and sort of, you know, playing with me. And I tried to pull out onto his fingers when I was down low and come up on my biceps. And I think Ingen described it real well right after that on a lot of the causes of torn biceps.
SPEAKER_00: I was trying to pronate in his hand, but his hand wasn't even moving. And he pressed down the same time my bicep was really susceptible. And when he did that and me pulling the other way, it popped. Like the doctor said, with so many years of the sport, it probably had its fatigue anyhow. But as far as the comeback, the training, workout, strength, everything's coming along real well. I did a little light pulling out of practice.
SPEAKER_00: two days ago, just to see. And right now, probably the biggest thing with my life would be strength, but the arm wrestling part is the mental part. Cause you know, I've had several injuries throughout is to block out the injuries. And when you get on that table, you gotta be a hundred percent going at it. And I think I will. Okay. There are super pits. It says I done Walter high engine, huge fan of you and Ron.
SPEAKER_02: And East versus West. Did NOUC 217's video on Mike Avello yesterday? Mike Avello, is it? Who is Mike Avello? Is it Mike Aiello maybe? I don't know. No, no, it's a different polar. I actually had no idea about him. I watched the video yesterday and he beat Pablo like quite comfortably in a tournament right-handed.
SPEAKER_02: which yeah they caught me off guard they yeah i saw 217 posting their video about but i didn't watch it i think it's the one because the title is like he's very shocked wow i didn't see this we need to follow these guys and we need to make armwrestling attractive for those guys so we can have new superstars so the armwrestling won't be circling around
SPEAKER_02: same people because the world is much bigger than what we are thinking. There are a lot of people that can make things more interesting for us. Um, there is another supermarket. I show you here and Renzo. I'm missing Ben since 98. I was only five years old.
SPEAKER_02: and i am so glad this sport becomes more and more popular big thanks to you and all supporters thank you thank you my friend thank you for your super chat and okay i have a question for iran do you realize do you realize that more we get older somehow we just a little bit stay away from the hands like
SPEAKER_02: understand this angle is kind of opening is it because our elbow doesn't handle anymore and then we try to get out of that pressure you know i mean and then eventually we are hurting our bicep while we are having the pressure instead of like some you know joint pressure and then we are more basic based on like like a arm curl you know this way yeah and then like michael got injured
SPEAKER_02: got injured devon got injured from bicep you got injured from biceps so like i i realized that those bicep injuries are becoming more common when we are getting older do you think it's the case or maybe i'm mistaken or you could be because every time i've uh hurt my bicep the first one i did back i actually when i went to worlds and i i heard it my right bicep tore
SPEAKER_00: Months earlier, I pulled Dave Randall horsing around, and I was in this position, the same position, pulling Dave when he tricepped, and I felt the pinch in my bicep. And it just didn't heal. Then when I went to Worlds, I got into a tight match, and then it fell apart. So that's why I'm on the same page with you. I think when you get separated and you try to do the pronation and all that, and you open up your bicep, and you're still very strong, but it allows too much pressure to be down on that tendon.
SPEAKER_02: um as far as why we open up more when we get older i don't know but i have i do notice that quite a bit with more of the older armors we do like to get in this position here yeah we are kind of staying away you know i think that maybe we don't have enough of the joint health to just you know more like this just stay in there yeah i mean maybe we just kind of like stay away
SPEAKER_02: uh from the pressure and then you know yeah just coronation based i i see that you are pulling more to back sides compared to your younger years and more sight if necessary even forward shoulder pressure you were doing yeah yeah probably i do i do aim for that corner more than i do straight to the side of the pad all right straight sideways yeah that i do
SPEAKER_00: why you know after so many years i think some things just develop more and more and you don't even realize it but uh i know that's been my biggest problem is i do get stretched out just a little bit even though i'm somewhat comfortable it's hard to come back and uh regroup when you get stretched out just a little bit too far um unless you can really hold it so do you follow east versus west event
SPEAKER_00: Since then, you know, have you been following, you know, after your events? Yeah. Oh, I watch them all. I watch them all. We don't miss them. You like it? It's the best show I've seen yet. I mean, to me, it's better. The UAL was great. WAL was great. But what you're doing by the matchups you're doing on a world level, to me, is just phenomenal. It's just fun to watch. There's a lot of arm wrestlers I've heard of but never watched them pull, and I've seen them pull.
SPEAKER_00: um yeah so it's introducing a lot of new faces plus i noticed you are trying to incorporate a lot of the young guys that you see that are stars that you see are stars and you try to get them over there yeah adam i can't pronounce his last name even though adam wasn't it who works out with chad silvers i mean it was great to see him go over there he's a future he could easily be a future star
SPEAKER_02: yes yes this is what i want i don't really care where our message is from i don't really care yeah this is our message if this guy has a bright future it is our uh our responsibility to motivate these guys and then push them up to where they can reach i mean if you ignore these guys i mean they may even disappear after the point you know yeah yeah i think that's i think what you're doing there where people see young guys
SPEAKER_00: Joe Piazza, On unknown guys show up at your east first West, it does put a lot of motivation and some of the younger guys that could they see that opportunity that hey. Joe Piazza, I don't have to become the greatest all I gotta do is show that i'm really good and i'm improving and I got a shot to get into.
SPEAKER_02: which now to me is the top of the line is the East versus West to be invited there. That is another reason that we did the qualification events because a lot of people were saying, how about us? How about us? And I was like, like, how can I, you know, like, like there is like already so many electors are waiting to be invited. Like, how can I invite everyone? But that's why we did the qualification. So if you really want, and if you are really good enough, you have the opportunity. Do you guys want to join the conversation or,
SPEAKER_01: start another conversation is guys just don't be shy yeah actually uh when you talked about uh older pullers like opening up more I actually uh because I wrote down a few questions and one of my questions was uh like why why do they actually open up uh for example I mean Devon you know he has a really strong uh I mean King's move I call I also call the open on top row
SPEAKER_02: and then uh gachevsky he used to be much more uh tight correct me if it's all happens after elbow which is i mean i cannot say my run but i know that's the case for devon that's the case for gachevsky it's even like becoming a case for me you know like there is something i don't know what is wrong but i feel like you know or maybe
SPEAKER_02: the elbow and arm string is not handling, but the pronator is so strong that, you know, when the guy is opening your arms, so you just make the things a little bit, you know, you know, that how to say that the tight, tighter angle, you know, more they press, more you dive, you know, I never go like this, but I have find myself like this, like when I pull Arthur Makaro on the,
SPEAKER_02: I was like this, but, but never like this, you know, but, but I realized that the pronation is so strong and then you just want to go away. But I think this is the case, but I don't know what, what Ron thinks, you know? I think, sorry, I think you're onto something with those comments, Inge, and I totally have no argument against any of them. I think when our elbows start to get sore,
SPEAKER_00: And also, I think we stretch out more because we pull away from our bicep. It might not be as strong, but the pronator and the tendons are a lot stronger. So we end up stuck out there more using our tendons than we are using our actual bicep. But at the same time, it opens our bicep up for injury. Yeah, yeah, you're right. Maybe upper arm is getting weaker more compared to those forearm muscles, you know. Maybe, you're right. Because I remember
SPEAKER_02: you never start the match tight anyways. You always like, you know, between our friends over here, when you go table, the way that you stand, my friends always call you lying because the way you were like, bitch, you know, but now never really tight. You had like, you had like exact 90, 90 degree. Unlike many of those guys that come close, you were like this and you were just moving sideways. You know who I, you know who I emulated that from?
SPEAKER_00: No, Johnny Walker, Johnny Walker, Johnny Walker would always just like this and look up to the sky. And I thought that's it. That's how you arm wrestle. And so I just sort of picked up that habit, I think, because I idolized that man and the way he pulled and his power. So, yeah, he's one, one of the four tour like, uh, legends. Uh, I should say that one of the goals and, um,
SPEAKER_02: is he coming with you in july as we told maybe uh if i think he was excited about it when i mentioned it to about april yeah if that's done we'll get back in touch with him listen if he comes i will be very happy you know i told you we do everything you know and then just i mean because we can't forget about those guys that who inspired us yeah you know in fact he didn't really inspire me he was
SPEAKER_02: before my time, but he inspired you guys, like John and you, and you guys inspired us. And then that's like how it went like this, you know, in my opinion. Yeah. Me and John had to get through him to get to the next level. Yeah. But yeah, we'll talk more about that down, down the road after this, you know, in private message. And then we'll get ahold of Johnny and see if he's still interested. Yeah. He can, he can be with you and with Angela together.
SPEAKER_02: It would be nice. Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. Yeah. We'll plan. We'll take, we'll check into that. Summertime. Maybe we can do a boat cruise in the sea and then we can do some, some fun stuff. Yeah. And Adnan, you just listen, Adnan, you are not going to get involved.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, I'm just referring back to the topic of being opened or something. Clearly, I'm not an expert or something, but I think inside armwrestling, at least for me personally, it's like more taxing on the body compared to outside because, you know, I
SPEAKER_02: I I for me like I feel whenever I'm practicing or something like a lot of pain in my elbow sometimes in my shoulder like it involves more arm compared to outside pulling so as you age then maybe it's the case where your muscles are like such as biceps this is a small muscle group it gets
SPEAKER_02: like well worn out or something so maybe that's the reason why older people may prefer to like everything outside or maybe we develop more and more and more pronated i don't know maybe yeah probably got a lot to do a little bit of everything that's been mentioned they're all good points but it is something that we do it seems like when we get older is spread out
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And how about injuries, Ron? Like, where do you like for me personally, when I started the arm massaging first, not the injury, but first this brachialis in the beginning, it was just hurting. And then, and then because you want to use your joints, those super healthy, like iron joints, because you are so young and then you press and you hear that, you know, that that was the second, second one.
SPEAKER_02: And the third one, if somebody is pulling you and then you go like this, you press and then you try to not lose. I was getting hurt from here at the beginning. And then some years later, this developed, this outside, it is mostly like overused. Because in fact, it's not overused, but it is the imbalance. Like because we do, normal people, of course, not many people do opposite way either, or this either. But we do
SPEAKER_02: too much of this and this yeah and then like this shortened this tendons and then you know stretching these ones so then this started to get injured and then the later my big backside of my shoulders you know because of this pressure all the time and then finally i tore biceps so this was my like uh how to say uh
SPEAKER_00: line up you know how say the injury you know from beginning to do and how about yours ron um most of my injuries like the elbow i've never really had serious problems with the elbows um um were my tears that you know the biceps and the pec otherwise most of my joints now the one that's in the back my back has more eggs i gotta be massaged out or chiropractor massage all the time i'm walking around like this
SPEAKER_00: yeah my back it's just too tight and like you that's my biggest issue as far as joints my joints overall are in pretty good shape when you're talking about the hands i do stretch my hands a lot this way and yeah i try to keep them limber um because i don't want to end up too tight so that might help but a lot of them might be genetics too as far as elbow pain i got knock on wood i've never really had too many
SPEAKER_00: it's just when i decided to blow something i i blow it all the ways out i don't get little aches and pains that's why you were super strong because of your dreams just tell me for how many how many years did you uh drink mother milk oh all my life no no no when you oh no you're not when you're a baby i couldn't tell you probably probably almost a couple of years probably a couple of years because
SPEAKER_00: because your joints are so strong so i was just thinking some people tell me that they they drink like three years four years and i was like probably their joint why is this well i had a brother less than two years after me so yeah we had to share yeah well we lived on a farm so i drank natural milk all the time too cow regular cow milk not from the store so
SPEAKER_02: think there's a lot of things we do that we get naturally that man doesn't mess with that makes us healthier so but yeah for sure the people who lives in nature is healthier and stronger than people who grow up in cities like my opinion for sure you know it's i that's my opinion as well in a lot of cases yeah like yeah anything anything you want to say looks like you are not going to get involved
SPEAKER_01: without being invited to talk. Are you as nervous as you told me you were going to be or you are okay? I mean, at the beginning, I'm not going to lie, I was very, very nervous because, I mean, if you told me one week ago that I would be on a podcast with Engin Terzi and Ron Beth, like, I would have called you crazy. How is that going to happen? But now I'm here. But yeah, I actually have a lot of questions. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Should we ask questions now or predictions first? Yes, yes, yes, go ahead. Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah, actually, this question goes to pretty much everyone in this podcast here. What do you guys think that is like one, what could be the next step for armwrestling to, how to say, to be like more mainstream, to be taken more seriously, to come across as more professional? For example, I...
SPEAKER_01: One of my problems with arm wrestling currently is the rule system. We don't really have a universal rule system, at least for super matches. I mean, tournaments all around the world, they pretty much do WF, you know, rules. But in super matches, we have so many different organizations with so many different formats, rules, you know. I have a question. All those fighting, you know,
SPEAKER_00: uh martial arts you know type of thing all those links they have the same exact rules i actually have no idea i don't know i i think no i don't but you know i think that yeah all right i think you're you're onto something but i think in as far as arm wrestling goes we'll we'll see a consensus of main rules but there's always going to be some tweaks in that pen and the organization and that and i don't think we should let that hinder the sport because
SPEAKER_00: the arm wrestlers will decide which sports are most legitimate by the rules they like. As far as long as I've been in here, I've seen different organizations with different rules. As long as they understand the rule before I go there, I'm comfortable with it. So I think we got to put more emphasis on other things and worrying about solid rules for every organization because I don't think that's going to actually work because smaller tournaments aren't going to do the same thing all the time.
SPEAKER_00: it's a it's a good prospect and it would be nice to see them all but i think the general part is always going to stay solid when your main rules are going to be there but there's always going to be little changes amongst different organizations so yeah i just like this this question came into my head because uh or this point came into my because i actually sometimes see euro fans um for example they watch east versus west and then they watch king of the table and
SPEAKER_01: They actually get confused as to why there is different rules. I think what we need to explain to them that different organizations may have different rules. Once they learn this, they won't be that confused. Yeah. Like yourself, are you confused so much? I mean, not confused, but if I'm being really honest, I would prefer if every Supermatch organization was
SPEAKER_02: more similar because if we compare a lot of things are similar you know they are similar that shoulder needs to be squared knuckle needs to be shown wrist needs to be straight and they come with the ready go and then your elbow this it's a foul it goes out it's a foul you need you have a pin pad the same exact table when it touches it's a pin and then but those details that are the difference it is not like you know really like black and white or something you know just like it's very
SPEAKER_01: me yeah for example like uh david daddy cam versus arthur morozov if that was his east at east versus west then you know he would be like the number one uh left oh my friend no listen this this story i i i like your question i will tell you honestly if you are going to an event you know that you know you know that you need to win four rounds
SPEAKER_02: you cannot say that, you know, if it was five rounds, I would be, if it was you go in an event, you know, that if it is treated, it's going to go to seven rounds, you know, that once the rules are set, then, I mean, I don't really, I don't think it makes sense to talk that if it was like this, if it was like that, you know, because you are not going east versus west, you go into that event, you need to make preparation for that event, you know, that, that, that is, I mean,
SPEAKER_02: yeah one point i i think just the the time between the rounds and king of the table especially when the athletes are gassed it's like it's always loose sometimes it can go for several minutes i'm not sure exactly how much it is originally but i think
SPEAKER_02: like sometimes it takes too long and that actually can influence the outcome of a certain match because you know some people recover faster some people like do not want to get like cold or something
SPEAKER_02: As for East versus West, no, I think it's much less. It's more standardized. And referring to Lagia's other question, I would say East versus West is, in my opinion, it's on its way to explode. East versus West, seven will be much bigger than six, and six was much bigger than five, and so on. So I think in a few years, it will be a different state.
SPEAKER_02: and i personally enjoy sports that are not mainstream although maybe some of you wouldn't like that but i do actually i mean i don't watch any other sport if i'm being honest i was into football like for a very brief time but no yeah yeah like for example for example now we talk about like some people you know we know that i i know ron also knows that you know after four zero
SPEAKER_02: I mean, there is no way that, I don't know if you agree or not, that Ron, but some people says that after 4-0, because he had the oxygen mask or something, he said, okay, enough. And then some people say that he should have lost. Do you agree with that? To me, it doesn't make sense. The guy won four rounds. I mean, it's over, but I don't know how you see it, Ron. No, I'm an advocate that if it's best out of seven,
SPEAKER_00: Once somebody has four wins, it's done. It's over. The biggest reason for that is you're asking the athletes to pull two more times, which could cause serious injury on something that's not needed. You know, it's always nice to see them go best seven, three, three, and then go into seven. But to me, once somebody takes a 4-0 lead, it should be done. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And I remember Travis saying something very funny about this. Like, I think he was talking about the five-round supermatches and that being better than best of seven. He was saying that if I whooped your ass, like...
SPEAKER_02: four times or three times in a row i mean i don't want to see your face on the table again so for me personally best of five makes the most sense okay uh andrea andre you said that you know um but there needs to be some changes my friends like for example because uh there are we are still trying to progress trying to find out we need to try and see
SPEAKER_02: That is like some changes, Andreev, is necessary because we are trying to improve. If we just stay at where we are and then if we don't do anything like to progress, then how can we, I mean, just get better? I have a question for you, Ran. Do you think that from the first event, I mean, in fact, it was East versus West too, but the first pay-per-view event to the last one you watched,
SPEAKER_00: do you see any progress with the production and everything or um i really don't pay that much attention to all of it but i did they do seem to be run very smooth and you know i know as far as core sports there's not all the drop-offs that were happening before so everything about the show just it does seem to be getting better every show do you have any suggestion we had a problem with some like first two events but now after the
SPEAKER_02: the satellite vehicle we brought and everything. Yeah. And the audio, the audio was huge improvement because I think the first and East versus West too, I think. And now it's like very, very clear. This is how we will improve the things to the fans that they, they trust. They continue to trust us. Do you have any suggestion, a suggestion Ron, that what we can do to better? Oh, shoot. Not from this end.
SPEAKER_00: i'm not into the promotions and i'm definitely not in i'm not into the social media stuff except for being on it um so but you know i think every time as everything progresses and you are looking at all what's the complaints are and you try to address the complaints and look at them you're always going to get better i mean because the one thing i've noticed you have and even core sports you you have a great team around you of a lot of people with great insight and
SPEAKER_00: You know, even yourself, you see you're the main, the main focus, the leader of East versus West. But I know you, uh, you see council from a lot of those around you and you bring in good people around you to help you with this whole show. And when you do that, you're always looking at bettering something, the product. Um, so I wouldn't have anything to say as far as trying to improve it, just keep working together as the team you are and listen to what people say. Yeah, I, I, I, I, I.
SPEAKER_02: follow and read every opinion. Like if it is good intended, you know, I for sure take a note. But some people, they really, they don't know how to express themselves in something. It's only discouraging. And I try to stay away from those people. But other than that, I try to bring to East versus West everyone who deserves to be there.
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't mean that there are not more people who deserve to be there, but they are not. But we are limited, you know. I do as many matches as possible. The commentators and announcers, Neil Pickup, Travis Bergens, you know, Raimonds have been there. Now Derek will be there, you know. Like, I mean, I...
SPEAKER_00: like those guys are incredible and i think that you know we as a big family you remember how it was northeast message board right remember how we were like yeah all together yeah it was incredible yeah yeah it was now back to what you just said i think that's what is helping east first west succeed so well is you bring in a lot of the big names that everybody's familiar with and they want to watch those people pull you know we'll use uh john brzenk and todd hutchings or even myself
SPEAKER_00: But you put those, people are going to watch it because they want to see those two pull or even get a screening or anybody. But then you're also bringing in like three or four matches of people that we know, you and me might know as our great arm wrestlers, but they're not as popular. So then the masses who watch social media are watching them, you know, go back to Adam from here, from the state that he brought in. Very few knew of them. But after that match he had at East versus West, a lot more people watch him now probably than they did before.
SPEAKER_00: So bringing in new blood all the time is good because, you know, some of us older ones, you got to look. Me, John, Todd, Michael, Todd, we're not going to be wrong. We're all 50 plus. So we got to start looking at the 20-year-olds. Yes, yes, yes. And we have some great young kids. I was at a practice this weekend. It's a real young practice overall.
SPEAKER_00: But it's close to the house, and it works great for Angie because she can pull with these kids real good. But, man, some of these kids, just from watching the social media, and they all know East vs. West. They all watch East vs. West. And they watch social media. These kids are learning a lot of the good technical stuff way ahead. We've got a 13-year-old kid. This kid's got a big hand, huge form. And, yeah, all his dad says he wants to do is arm wrestle.
SPEAKER_02: transmit on this earth on this earth there are many many many people who have potential to be a future legends a new rambas a new devon a new maybe even john you understand we we just need to give them opportunity and they are not only learning technical things but we need to give them a dream to
SPEAKER_02: work for work for yeah so that is why we did those qualifications those qualifications events none of them are my events those that already existed great events i just asked them would you want to involve east versus west qualification is good for you and good for those people that who want to find a bridge
SPEAKER_02: from there to here, you know, I wish that we could do that more often. And I don't know, somehow, and then it will be even better that they will have a dream to like, for example, you said, you are getting older, john is getting older, that one is getting older, all those guys are getting older. And like, you remember, run in the past, the American lightweights, like, like Dave Patton, Cobra, and Jerry, Jenny, you know, all these guys,
SPEAKER_02: yeah and berth whitfield and many others you know many others and these guys were world level pullers but after a point um american heavyweights super heavyweights continue to be competitive while those guys they didn't have many opportunities from the uh professional events because the world likes to watch only the big guys it was the same with the boxing it was same with the ufc but it changed in those sports we have
SPEAKER_02: McGregor, we have Habib, we have Mayweather, you know, the most famous, the guys that are making the most money. While our masters, so that's why I try to make these people also like getting close with the East so they get experience, they get knowledge, they get motivated. So the level of North America will increase and then the competition will be even tougher, you know, that's what I'm thinking. Yeah, you got to have great goals to go for.
SPEAKER_00: um you know you you have a pinnacle of the best the elite and if the people down here at the bottom don't see a way to get up that hill then they quit and a lot of people will quit but there's going to be a few people that see an opportunity to get to that top spot and go to east first west and go to wa you know stuff like that it's it we do need that motivation and seeing themselves and seeing guys
SPEAKER_00: know like you bring these younger guys in and they were just out of practice with a couple and they see that they got the opportunity it helps them motivate their own self into working hard so they can try to get to that level so it's just yeah we got we got to keep teaching what you and me know to the young and tell them there is you know just keep working you know you and i we both know what they feel how they feel yeah i know yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: And as you know, people who knows how they feel, we need to promote them. And I know that that's the reason that you are also supporting me. I see that every time I need a support, you are there. I see your like there. I see sometimes your comment there. And I know that you are not actually supporting me, but you are actually supporting my vision. This is how I take it. Yeah, that would be accurate. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah i love it we got we got to have a way to keep the sport growing and social media is such an awesome tool to use and you're using it to the best abilities and it's really starting to open up some of these young kids into watching and learning this this great sport that's given you and me a lot of great adventures yes again about you realize that we never received the respect that we deserve because people thought that we were just a large sports yeah yeah but uh
SPEAKER_00: It's slowly coming along. So will we ever be that wildly? I think social media is what's going to make arm wrestling popular, which it already has made it more. And somebody just wrote an article. You might have seen it. I forget who it was from. Maybe somebody from Canada. Promoters, the small promoters, because social media has taken such, making such strides in arm wrestling and even like East versus West.
SPEAKER_00: that promoters are going to have start figuring out how to change their events because events for years had only 50 to 70 entries are now getting up 150 200 entries uh this tennessee tournament the other day up here in tennessee 230 entries for a small pride state tournament wow yeah and years ago i remember years ago that was only 70 80 entries there so it means that three times bigger
SPEAKER_02: know devon devon larat also just yeah helped this a lot yeah one of the biggest reasons you know that that's the fact you know and if we talk about this some predictions about the uh super matches upcoming ones like you you probably don't know all of them but i will ask you the ones that that you would for sure know like for example what do you think about do you know sasha
SPEAKER_00: Me? Yeah, I've seen him. I've seen him pull before, yeah. What do you think, him and Sasho, Sasho and Paul Lee? It's going to be interesting. Paul's driving along pretty good. He got a gift pulling me, but yeah, he's been moving along. I haven't seen Sasho pull in a while, so I don't know how active he's been. He just pulled off about five months ago and won. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: it's definitely a test for paul lynn sasha's been around his name's a little more um popular um it's definitely a big win for paul lynn if he can get it but again i think it should be a really good war um paul's so technical on the table uh what he lacks might lack in strength which i don't think so much he's pretty savvy so
SPEAKER_00: I don't like making predictions. I'm terrible at predictions. Yeah, it's okay. It's pretty good. Now, what weight are they going to be? 209. Okay. Yeah, you know, I got to root for Paul Linn, definitely. I have to say Paul Linn's going to win.
SPEAKER_02: You are an American patriot. I know that. I know that. You have to be good. I'm the same way for my country. And this is beautiful that you want your countrymen to win. It's beautiful. So I do mine. You do yours. I respect it. This is a beautiful competition. Much better than wars, you know, that we do. We take care of everything at the table. Yeah. It's a lot better. More humane than wars. We don't need wars.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: yeah just before we get into the predictions i referring to the suggestions maybe to grow the sport i don't remember the guy's names i think i saw one of the comments in some video he was suggesting if that's like uh possible to have the athletes uh arm wrestling in a like a sleeveless shirt yeah yeah because i think that might drop into my mind i will decide you know i will just think
SPEAKER_02: pluses, minuses. I can't make so quick decision. I will just think about it. Yeah, of course. I really think it's a good idea. And Lagia, how do you see this polling? Adnan, you were going to say something or you were done? No, you go ahead. I was just going to follow up. No, no, it's okay. You can have it. I mean, honestly, I've been wondering like in my head,
SPEAKER_01: who could possibly like be more stylistically dangerous for Paul because he was first set with Haji Murad but he's more like a well-rounded guy and Sasho is less well-rounded but he has a very awkward style it's a very unique style that a very unique threat that he brings with his short arm and compact structure
SPEAKER_01: and uh honestly many people say that you know rustam was would have dominated him if he didn't get injured but we clearly saw that uh the hook was actually really affected by paul and i'm not saying he would have won i'm not saying rustam would have won for me it's unknown but for sure it changed the uh playing field like for sure it looked very effective and i think
SPEAKER_02: maybe he should trust his hook more and we can see something interesting this is what he should do yeah i agree yeah so you are seeing a close match i have sasha as a favorite but i will not be surprised if uh paul pulls it off again yeah yeah yeah because the guy just like seriously especially mentally the guy is very very dangerous and he's professional you know his preparation and everything you know he's just like and you are not
SPEAKER_02: I love Paul Mann, but I think Sasho is the heavy favorite. I think I'd give it like 70-30. I know it's arm wrestling and I think he can go, but I think Sasho is more experienced and maybe does not have that much of experience in East versus West format, but I think he can adapt. And his hook is like...
SPEAKER_02: there is nothing different with the East versus West it's yeah yeah like waffle and I mean if you are pulling against Devon let us you should worry you know about anything you're not only professional about what he's doing so uh but other than that you know I don't know Sasho and Paul pulling East versus West format everything is the same you know he's more experienced overall
SPEAKER_02: square square and then wrist straight shoulder knuckles shoulder ready go boom you know i mean i don't think that the the the the little tiny rules rule will make so much difference and okay let's go to another one do you know prokopchuk yeah i've seen him pull a couple of times yeah like he pulled with corey corey miller and the guy is gonna pull with uh
SPEAKER_00: yeah man well i'm definitely gonna pull root for doug but uh you know due to time on the table and experience and all that if they got to be the same weight and they're there i gotta go with bakuba or however he pronounces his name yeah yeah yeah but but his official weight category 165 but he can be around near 170 around no no 180 around 180.
SPEAKER_00: And the category is 187. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think the few pounds is going to make much difference with them. But Doug Erlich has always just, you know, he's always amazed me sometimes the way he shines in the heat of the moment. So we'll have to see. But I think Doug, if we're going to get percentage 60-40 for Quebec. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: experience the world league experience the table probably and from what I've seen of his last matches yes I actually agree 100% even on the percentages I think Daniel is more active I know like Doug shocked the world against this match with Coach Ray it was amazing but I think yeah like 60-40 Daniel and you Mertz
SPEAKER_01: uh yeah I actually would agree with that with the percentage because uh well I remember I don't know if it was Paul Linn who said that on the fix or something that uh the version of darkness against country was actually like far from his peak so I'm very curious what he brings to the table against Daniel and uh yeah he's probably like the like naturally bigger guy and
SPEAKER_01: I believe he can take his wrist, but Daniel has that really awkward sticking point where he loses his wrist, but he still has that sticking point. He stares at you. Yeah, we saw it against Corey Miller, but I think Douglas will be more dangerous. So, yeah, I'm very curious. Very curious. And let's go to another one. Samushia versus Brandon, Ron.
SPEAKER_00: hmm who's brandon yeah i know brandon el seltzer i've never seen him pull i've never gripped up with a man but i mean he's definitely hungry and putting in a lot of work yeah and who's he pulling david yeah yeah briefly um yeah there again i'd have to go with uh
SPEAKER_00: I'd have to go against Brandon, even though I think Brandon's hungry. If Brandon gets tied into a war, he could fight his way through it. But I think experience is going to win that one too. Brandon's never really been out on the big stage, I don't think. I think it's all been local tournaments. Some super matches, but local. Yeah, I think he has been at Monster Factory against Craig Tuller. Yeah. He beat him after a war.
SPEAKER_02: What was surprising that Craig's, that the fast hooking ability is very good, but he couldn't hook Brandon. Yeah, and then Davit is going there. I'm just thinking, what if Davit cannot hook him and then Brandon just hang him there? Because Brandon also, he's also known with his incredible endurance, the same with Samushia too. And Samushia can also pin someone this way as well. So if Samushia hooks him,
SPEAKER_02: It's a bad day for Brandon. But what if we cannot hook him? Then we may see something very exciting. Are we there, Ran? I think he's frozen. Yeah, I think he froze. And what do you think, Adnan?
SPEAKER_02: I think Brandon was the guy that pulled against Travis, I think, right? Like in the event which Todd Ziller pulled. I don't remember correctly. But I mean, if the guy pulled the win, no matter what condition Travis is in, I'm going to say that Brandon wins over Davit Sampson. So you are saying that Brandon is going to win? Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Wow. And you, Mert? Honestly, I left a comment, I think in a live chat earlier, that I said at 85 kg, I'm not betting against Davit Samushia unless it's someone like Zola or a healthy Engin Terzi. So that's my prediction.
SPEAKER_01: i know i know that like everyone favors david but i think it's a huge chance for brandon and i think that might like motivate him to to to push himself so maybe he will shock shock the community yeah absolutely and i agree with the with the point that uh engine that you brought up that he may not be able to hook him that's also a very interesting point that uh yeah i'm like imagining what if he cannot hook brandon that that could be interesting but
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think I would still bet on Davit. I also have seen Davit at WAF without his wrist win against the top roller. But I think that's going to be a cool match. Mehmet, what part of Germany are you? I'm in the west side. Nordrhein-Westfalen is what it's called, this region. And yeah. Okay, yeah. Okay, Ron, there is a good match that you will enjoy.
SPEAKER_02: rob vision jr versus your your sound is of your your microphone we don't hear you you're on mute all right yes yeah okay yeah my phone got warm first of all have you ever pulled up
SPEAKER_00: No, I haven't. I've never even really gripped up with Rob. Wow, that's interesting. It'll be an interesting match because I know Zurab. I know the power he has. I know Rob has power, but I haven't seen him around in so long. And now he's just coming out of the woodwork again and taking this match. You know, he's another one. I really can't count Rob out, but I don't know how long the time off the table has hurt him.
SPEAKER_00: or if he actually has. I mean, I saw him on a picture with Jerry Catarat, and he looks very fit, even though he made a comment that he hasn't hardly been working out in two years. So, I mean, I got to lean towards Rob. But like I said, you can't ever call Rob out. He's got that big hand. And after a few practices, arm wrestling is like riding a bike. He could actually, you know, figure out how to take him and try to get him there.
SPEAKER_02: so but i'd probably be leaning towards to rob yeah and adnan uh man i'm really really looking forward to this match this will be like a battle of the biceps and uh it's not that i favor uh raw i actually like would give the edge to zura but uh like rob i think he's is he wants to make a statement that he's still
SPEAKER_02: like it can compete at the highest level and if if he didn't win i'm sure the match will be like fire and i hope he wins around with two maybe the whole match just to see him going crazy like i love watching this part yeah i i i saw a match you know where where rob top rose uh dave cheffy in 2010 that that's the year that dave cheffy won the waffles in 242 you know
SPEAKER_01: i was like wow you know and and and math how do you see that yeah um honestly in the beginning you probably saw many comments say that uh rob is rusty he's not taking it seriously you probably saw some of those comments at the beginning i was like yeah maybe they are right but honestly he sounds very like motivated very serious and i if i was zura i would be very very serious about this match i think um yeah i
SPEAKER_02: Honestly, 50-50. I actually don't know. These guys want respect. If you show them enough respect, these guys will be motivated. And now, there is something with the East versus West. The Western team, first time I invited them, they were just like individuals. Now, they are like a team all together. And they are really motivating each other. Yeah, both teams.
SPEAKER_02: are making plans together so that i love about it i love it i think that's awesome that's really cool okay let's go to another one adam warson's keep bacho saginashvili you don't know bacho probably right ron who is it bacho saginashvili they say he's cousin of levon saginashvili this guy is very young 18 years old maybe 19 but i don't think so probably 18 years old
SPEAKER_02: and they the georgians just talk so highly about this guy yeah and yeah they are like he like whoever i say they say yeah he would beat them and i think like are you crazy and they say even in hook we stood up he is 50 50. this is what they said yeah so who's he pulling i i've looked at the car a couple of times adam adam adam warzynski adam
SPEAKER_00: Adam had a good war with Robbie Russell just this weekend. So, um, he might've went up there and practice more. Um, but, uh, that could be very interesting cause Adam can hold forever in a book. Um, so, um, now I'll have to go with, I definitely got to go with Adam, but I don't know the guy good enough. And if he can pull that damn hard and then 50 50 with zero, uh, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you got some good matches again. This would be interesting to watch. So again, I probably won't make a prediction, but I definitely got a root for Adam. Yeah, this kid's only 18 or 19. Yeah. Being compared to that level. Wow. That's awesome. I saw him in 2019 Waffles. There was a category, 15 years old category, subjuniors. He won that category. He was 15 at the side table. He was beating the seniors.
SPEAKER_02: Adam better be ready. Adam better be ready. I think Adam is an incredibly dangerous guy. Adam is an incredibly dangerous guy. He is possibly one of the most dedicated workout guys I know. He's right up there with the best. I have a question for you. When I set him against Chance Bacho, Zurab and Chance Bacho, who did you think they were going to win?
SPEAKER_00: I thought for sure after I beat Chance that he was going to get whooped. And then several days before that, I told him that he ended up... I'm sorry, my phone rang. Can you hear me now? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I was surprised to see Chance take him that easily. I wasn't surprised. No? Wow.
SPEAKER_02: Because of his style, you know. Because of his style, you know. Yeah, I mean, like once Chance curled his wrist, he's a very dangerous guy. Yeah. Very dangerous guy, yeah. And people said, why did you set this match, Engin? Zurov is going to kill Chance, Joe. Do you hate Chance? And people were saying, I was like,
SPEAKER_02: I don't think that it's going to be like a domination by Zurab. Zurab may win, but I don't think like it's going to win. In my opinion, Chance had the edge, you know, but I never mentioned. But since the match over, I can mention. Yeah, that one definitely was due to style. Chance's style, definitely Zurab's weakness. Yeah. And another question for you. Arif Ertem versus Georgii Dzeranov. Do you remember Georgii?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. He pulled with left arm with Wagner Bortolato. He beat him 3-2. And then he also pulled the Ukrainian Kalinyshenko. He was losing 2-0. He came back and beat him 3-2 in the same event. So he won right and left 3-2, 3-2. The Kazakh guy. That guy is going to pull Arif Ertem, who recently pulled against Kody West. Man. Man, that's
SPEAKER_02: I'm not as good as remembering and understanding these guys as you are. I don't like these predictions. Okay, then let me ask to Adnan. What's that? I'm going to ask Adnan, you know, if you don't remember well enough. I'm going to give you well-known matches very soon and we can finish. Yeah. Adnan, how do you see this? I wanted to say that if I remember correctly, I think Zalinov lost to...
SPEAKER_02: kalinichenko the first two rounds i think it was in a top hole yeah so i think that uh arif is like a pure top roller as far as i know and i think he will be like very explosive it will be very difficult for design of to hold him or maybe to hook him i know if you hooked him i think the chances favors uh desire but i think rfs
SPEAKER_01: is way too explosive and he's like 150 kg but he moves extremely quick i think araf is a very underrated wrestler and he takes the win i think decisive like i forgot the word yeah honestly i pretty much agree with everything uh anand said uh because uh to beat out if you need more like a fully outside fully back like really strong like aramis did you know in east versus west too
SPEAKER_01: And honestly, if they both go outside, I favor Arif. And I don't know if Gyorgy can fully hook him. And usually when Arif's opponent tries to hook, he keeps his wrist and he's super explosive. And we saw that with Corey West. So I think Arif's going to win. Yeah, I think if he manages to hook, if Zalanov manages to set the match in a hook, I think he wins. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I understand. And Caroline, Caroline Loomis, thank you for super chat. Hi, Ron. Does Angie have any matches coming up? Do I? No, no, no, Angie. Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. Oh, Angie. Yeah. The next thing Angie does will be going to Cobra's qualifier.
SPEAKER_02: and qualifying running through the women's qualifier to come back to turkey wow wow wow you know we will be fun yeah and and okay run you know this one iraqli zirakashvili i don't like predictions probably go with iraqli
SPEAKER_02: wow wow because most of the people i follow their favorite on their way what's that most most of the people think that on that way is the favorite but you go with directly how do you see that probably because i know him better know his name better what do you think about these guys oh man
SPEAKER_00: the wrong guy to ask this thing i just watch enough just to uh watch it um i know at rockley i've watched rockley and who's he pulling i'm having a hard time here yeah the other guy is on that wave the one that michael recently pulled oh all right yeah just briefly
SPEAKER_00: I don't know him enough. I don't know him as much as your two guests are. No, they're arm wrestlers. That's for sure. Yeah, but don't you remember Ongarbaev also beat John Bersink? Yeah. Now you put it in perspective. All right. Yeah, that's going to be very interesting. Now that I heard who we're talking about. Yeah, I might have to switch. That's going to be a very good match. Very good. Finally, Ron. Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: yeah that could that could go and uh against the rockley but i that one when i saw it i thought damn that's going to be a good one that that should be a really good match to watch it should be fun it'll be interesting and and it's needed i think both earn that both of them have earned that match yeah and before before i know your time is uh like
SPEAKER_02: Less, but I will just say Dave Chaffee versus Revaz. Do you remember Revaz Lutidze, the tall Georgii guy? Yeah. I'm never going to go against Dave Chaffee. Is it because he's your countryman or is it because... Dave's let down. I think Dave has something to prove if he's been working. I'd have to talk to him because he's had a couple of bad outings.
SPEAKER_00: he could actually do use a good winter too. Um, but yeah, um, if it goes into a hook, it definitely would be Dave. I don't really know the guy he's pulling. So, and that's the problem. That's why I got to go with my country, man, because I know I'm better than the guys they're pulling overall. Um, I'm not, I don't get all day to sit and look at arm wrestling videos. So I need to, but, um,
SPEAKER_00: yeah um i hope all the best today that's for sure i'm really definitely going to root for you and not because he's just a countryman he's a good friend too yes yes yes also very strong very powerful side pressure incredible probably the best best side pressure in the world i want to hear your two guests have thoughts say about it because they seem pretty knowledgeable on all these guys i like it okay okay you start okay you start that now then go ahead
SPEAKER_02: I was going to say that, honestly, whenever someone is having a match against Dave, he should know the initial set that you will have from Dave is unstoppable. Unless you're Levan or maybe Hermes. But I think if it's not one, maybe even two rounds. But I don't know. Levan also is extremely powerful and he's a very heavy guy. I think he may be able to stop him.
SPEAKER_02: uh this match i cannot really predict like both guys are really special and they make a great matchup great matchup honestly like it will be one of the best people keep saying that they both
SPEAKER_02: like uh big john and uh john took the rest of iraqi and uh ongarbaev took the rest of john but like they say that it will be an easy match for on the vibe or something but i really don't think so like iraqi proved he can pull in a flop press which is weird and uh like he's the more powerful guy but i think on the vibe is the more like well-rounded and the smarter arm wrestling
SPEAKER_01: I really can't predict, although I honestly would want Ongarbaev to win. And I think he really has a very high chance because it's a very, very close match. I don't know. How about you, Mert? Both matches? Yeah, I mean, I will start with Rivas versus Dave. I would say the key here is that, I mean, why Rivas failed against Morozov was because he got, like, hooked in. Morozov in the setup, you know, he supinates in.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think Dave does that. So we will, I think we will see like a really, like a top, top row battle. And so I think Revaz will get to shine a bit more than he did against Morozov because for example, when they slipped in round one, I mean, in my opinion, Revaz was like, like a dominant hand control against Morozov when they slipped in round one. So, yeah, I mean, and they both have like a flop risk as a plan B. So this match is really interesting to me, but I would say that Dave,
SPEAKER_01: yeah i have dave as like 60 40 favorites i would say yeah because oh he's probably incredible tight pressure yeah of course yeah and how much other match yeah uh i think there's a chance that clearly could win like three zero because yeah i think i mean i think he has better hand control first of all and uh sure it actually has a pretty impressive and very surprising uh flat press but i don't think
SPEAKER_01: it will work against Khidir Ghali. I think he's too aggressive for that flop press to work. And Jordan was also kind of, he was like more open, and I don't think Khidir Ghali will defend against a flop press like that, and he has more endurance. So yeah, there's a chance it could be 3-0 for him, but I think there could be battles like, for example, in Alizhan versus Oleg, that was 3-0, but very interesting 3-0. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Let's go to Ron. Ron, Devon Larratt versus Genadi Kvikvinia. Of course I had to go with Devon. He's not my countryman either. Almost, almost. Almost. Oh, man. Yeah, let me think. You know, it's hard to go against Devon. I mean, because he pulls shit out of his hat unless he's pulling LeBron.
SPEAKER_00: Then nothing mattered for him. Yeah, I don't know the other guys all that well, but I know Devon's endurance. If Devon doesn't win the first one or two, it might not matter. So we'll see how his injuries all hold up. Genadi is going to come as big as he has ever been. Probably bigger than ever. This is the most important match. It is. Adam, now you got me.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it'll be interesting. They're all interesting, Engen. Every match you put out there is interesting for one reason or another. Genadi is a horse, and he has a lot of fight. The thing with that one there, now that, you know, it takes me a little while to think of who we're all pulling, is he's got to take the wind out of Genadi early. Because if Genadi would get a win, that's the one where if Genadi would get a win in round one, he seems to get fired up more and more as the matches go on. So...
SPEAKER_00: But yeah, so Devon would probably have to win the first one now that I think about it, just to knock the wind out of him a little bit. Because if Genadi gets all fired up, then it could be a long day for Devon. Yeah, but Devon said that he's going to make Genadi submit. Yeah, he's going to make him submit. And I said, are you sure? He said, yeah, he will be resisting.
SPEAKER_02: they will say about Genadi, he said he will be resisting, but as much as a cow, that all four legs are cutting and moving on the ground, you know? And so he said that he will have the forearm, so he can move as much as he wants. And then after Genadi heard this, Genadi get angry. And he said, this is from now on is personal. And he said, he will crush them. He said, but we will see, I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know what's going to happen. But Devon's example sometimes. He isn't emotional. He does seem like a very emotional puller. When his emotions get up or down, depend on a lot. But yeah, hopefully Devon's not setting himself up for a trap and getting hurt. But I'm sure Devon won't be super light. I'm sure he'll be in the 270, 280 area. I'm hoping he gets up a little bit. He better not come in at 240.
SPEAKER_00: No, he's already 270. Yeah, that's what I thought. He's going up to 280. But after watching Jerry and Genadi, Genadi has a lot of endurance in his own brain, too. I think Genadi pulled in the wrong way against Jerry. Oh, he did. He did. Yeah. All the battles I had with Jerry, the only one I beat him on was the one Dave Randall taught me how to be brave enough to push through his shoulder.
SPEAKER_02: yeah i remember you put here you press it like this and block is gone i think it was like what was the name of the event yeah yeah that one yeah i think in same event don't also beat him the similar way i think he also did like a little bit helps grenade yeah i showed john how to beat him then john come in and beat him too yeah you know like
SPEAKER_02: the run people doesn't know that like during john's prime time i'm talking about prime time yeah you are the guy who beat john most around the guys who are near his weight category i'm not talking about 1999 but i i like you have in many different tournaments you have did you ever count how many wins you have on him
SPEAKER_02: I think I got, I might have six, but John's got a whole lot more. I know, I know. Probably 26 or something. My wins come over a series of different tournaments, not just Supermatch series. Yes, yes. Many different events. Yeah. Yeah. So. No, that's the thing. You can beat in one Supermatch six times. It's not like you beat in six times. You beat in one time in the tournament. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah. But many people don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I sent him home with second place a couple of times. Yeah, more than that. Yeah, I remember. If you want, I can lecture you about the things that you did. I should. I should. After my match, everybody can tell me what I did wrong because I usually do a lot wrong when I lose.
SPEAKER_00: so no no no i'm talking about lecture you about your history you know what you have done this and what you have done that year i remember the first time you met me we met each other out in uh we're heading up to pocatello was it and we're yeah main event main event and you got in the vehicle and you start telling me about all the matches i'm in and i'm like damn you know more about me than i knew about myself
SPEAKER_02: 1997 1997 yeah that's the same gold yeah your your memory so amazing man i think in that event okay i won 32s and craig tuller won 43s and there was a guy they call him mago or something from canada won that and then 165s i think i think i think either bill bellinger or
SPEAKER_02: don't know but 176 was kevin bongard 187 was john 198 was bill birzing 220 was you 242 was jerry and the supers i think that the brazilian giant i think i won as far as i am yeah yeah yeah probably close yeah it was it was a good event huh did you do i think you followed 98 as well i won both ends
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. I went there twice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You were there. You won again. Yeah. Yeah. It was great. Yeah. Yeah. No, that was one of the better tournaments of those days. That's for sure. They put together quite a show. Yeah. And I think in this, after that event, you went to Vegas and beat John there, both John and Bill. Yeah. Yeah. I had a little attitude that day. They tried setting me up for third place and it didn't work.
SPEAKER_02: But he came back and two months later, he beat you in a Tahoe event. Yeah. Yeah, John did. He didn't sit quietly after I beat him. He'd make sure he was ready the next time and then make me pay for it. But oh well. You guys have mutual respect for each other. Big respect. I think so. Yeah. That's good. But do you remember Ron?
SPEAKER_02: Before the Tahoe event, you and I at the breakfast table pulled a little bit with left arm. You don't remember? Yeah, you mentioned that to me. Yeah, I remember doing something with you at the event. But like I said, my memory is not as... Before the event we did at the breakfast table, I was like 139 pounds. You hold with me with left arm. I'm not going to share what happened there.
SPEAKER_02: And again, everyone is blown by your memory, honestly, like all the comments and everything, and especially me here. It's unbelievable. I'm not going to say what happened at the breakfast table, but you were impressed. Oh, very. Yeah, very. And then I remember when I pulled the overall final match against Erlich Woffel, he was the SWAFT super airway champion. I remember you get up from like far away from your chair. You came down to the stage just to watch close.
SPEAKER_02: and then and then i i was like 63 kilo i kind of took the handle eric waffle and then he pinned me with a dead wrist with whole body it was 125 kilo beating like this and then you look at me and you you i remember like yesterday you look at me you were like i knew this you were like this and then you went back you know yeah i remember that so
SPEAKER_02: but again i got to go i got the same guy calling me twice okay okay thank you very much thank you very much and tell angie we say hello and see you well july in july thank you thank you okay all right sounds great all right thank you hey good meeting you too all right y'all have a great day thank you very much take care i'm not i'm not a math we continue
SPEAKER_01: I want to ask your opinions again about Zlatan and Tobias. I think I was first always, so I'd like to go first. Okay. I mean, I've been thinking about this stylistically, and I think stylistically, Tobias, I would say, can be very dangerous for Vitalii, but
SPEAKER_01: Honestly, the way I saw him, like, I mean, no offense to the other competitors, but he was kind of toying with, uh, with them in that one, uh, Russian left-handed tournament. I think it was, it was a few months ago. I forgot the name. And I mean, he even caught like, uh, see live in a hook and then top rolled in and then press. It was like experimenting. And I don't know, I think despite the style, I think Vitalii is too strong and yeah, I think we tell you, honestly.
SPEAKER_02: but what what if the strength level somehow close do you think that do you think that stylistically uh morozov maybe travel no morozov tobias yeah yeah i agree with you 100 yeah 100 yeah
SPEAKER_02: I actually think Tobias will come victorious. I mean, if it was a right-hand match, of course, it's Vitalii's favorite. But Tobias is unbelievable. And I think...
SPEAKER_02: i think like i i was not so sure when i yesterday listened to vitaly saying that he also trains hook which is uh like it was surprising for me like but i think i think tobias has like more chance given that he's using his dominant hand
SPEAKER_02: and he's stronger on that hand also not just the connection the quickness the explosivity so i think i think uh tobias will do you do you guys realize how uh vitale is careful compared to the many people in the community whenever he said that yes he lost against morozov but not when morozov tried to go outside he said yeah when morozov tried to go outside
SPEAKER_02: He got toppled so terribly, you know, like Tobias took his wrist so easily. Yeah, and probably follows up with an unbelievable hook. So Vitalii knows that Tobias' hand is very, very dominant and very strong. Of course, La Leche also has a very strong hand. But so I think that if it goes totally pure top roll versus top roll, Tobias may have abs.
SPEAKER_02: But, but the, what I am thinking that, you know, the back pressure follow with the side pressure, if, if, if the letting can do that, then, then, then it may be. But whenever I ask to Tobias, I said, like, do you think he can beat you with side pressure? He said, he doesn't give any possibility that he will be beat with the side pressure. He said, the only way we tell you to beat him is pure outside top row. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It will be a great match. No questions. I think Vitalii's hook wouldn't be as strong as Morozov. I doubt that. I think it might be difficult for him to hook Tobias even after one... He's not going to try to hook him. He said he would go hook only if Tobias was into hook. Yeah, like in the second round maybe or something. Like, for example, yesterday Vitalii said that his hook is good and better than what people think.
SPEAKER_02: But having a good hook and having hook inability are two different things, you know. So I don't know. So what do you guys actually think? Who is winning? You said that... I'd say Tobias. Yeah, I think Vitalii will be... Because he's like super healthy on the left too. I think on the right arm, he has like a shoulder injury. He can't hit super hard to the side or he's...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know, his head is really suffering from it, he said. And left-handed, he's very healthy. And I think, yeah, I think he will just a little bit too much. But it's very close. Do you think that Laletin has the same side pressure hit with his left arm as same as with right arm? I wouldn't say so, honestly. His right arm, even if he trains both arms, he's on a level that's really rare to have both of your limbs
SPEAKER_02: like on the highest, highest level. So I think it, I don't know, I'm not speaking for the guy himself, but I doubt like maybe 80%, if not less. Yeah. What, you know, what, what, what, uh, excites me about young guys like Tobias because of their hunger, their dream, you know, they just come,
SPEAKER_02: like to prove something they i can see whenever i look at him i see the same exacting i saw with hermes in the past same exacting i saw with iraqi i see that hunger that that's a very dangerous thing for their opponents you know and so yeah how about if we go to devon versus gennady who wants to go first by the way guys i i don't want to uh i want to say something tomorrow
SPEAKER_02: 12 p.m eastern time uh levan saginashvili will be my guest and so just wanted to inform you guys very nice that will be waiting of course yeah let's see what he will say yeah like yeah if you want to go ahead with uh i mean
SPEAKER_01: I told you already, I mean, I can tell you, but I left some comments on your channel that this really, like, I genuinely believe match of the year potential. This can be similar to Ron Bath versus Zurab, which in my opinion is still the best match in East versus West history so far. And a few key points would be that, I mean, for example, if, I don't think it will happen, but if they both go in a hook in round one, I think Girardi can, can, uh,
SPEAKER_01: be more dominant. But I think the only way to Genadi to actually win the match that I can imagine is with a dead risk technique. I don't think he can hook Devon, honestly. And the more I visualize the match, I actually don't see him like out climbing Devon's open arm top row because Devon is, I mean, yeah, he did it against Michael, but I think Michael's is more, I don't want to like use the wrong word, but kind of loose.
SPEAKER_01: Devon looks much more solid and obviously has a longer lever. And I really think the only way for Genadi to win is with a deadlifts technique, which he is really good at, obviously. I mean, Devon put Evgeny in that position, but I would say that Genadi is much more comfortable in those positions than Evgeny. So this is, I mean, an incredible match. Genuinely, I have no idea who to pick yet. 50-50.
SPEAKER_01: But you guys, you are saying that there is no way Genadi's reach to handle Devon's pronator. Not in the sense that he can win the match. I think maybe, maybe at the beginning, like in round one, fresh for fresh, maybe. But honestly, I don't even see that. Like to fully handle it, I honestly don't see it. Devon's pronator is incredible. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is something very special.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's very rare on a very rare level. I'm telling you guys, this guy, I know forever, but lately, the guy is different. He leveled up in a very rare way. He's different. And I think that is very, very dangerous. And also, I think that Devon's wrist is very, very strong. That's the problem. You know, people say that, for example, Genadi said that
SPEAKER_02: will hit he will be hitting uh devon more than he hits michael but you hit michael because you had the hand you know will you have the hand when you both go outside or you you really think that you know you will have the upper hand you know it's like you know it is not yeah this this is why i think i if he tries to out climb the uh devon's open on top of i actually i really don't see him being a
SPEAKER_01: very successful there. I think the only way is some sort of deadlifts technique. I mean, first extend him outside maybe and then go into the deadlifts press, something like that. I would personally say that
SPEAKER_02: like multiple surges isn't the way exactly to beat Devon because like he takes away like a bit of you every surge you do and they they will get weaker and weaker and uh if Devon's hand is like like you know yeah like this when the match started you're not a climb on
SPEAKER_02: michael's hand he was he had everything behind yeah yeah yeah you know yeah but you know if if if they're not they would have the same position that he had same hand position that he had against michael if you would have the same against that one as well he can hit you it will really hurt you but the problem is when when leon even went fully outside you know i saw
SPEAKER_02: Both Levan and Devon's wrists were in equal position. They didn't completely lose, but they were flat, maybe a little bit lost. So Devon's wrist handling is so strong, it's hard to go over his hands. When Levan did the same hit to Ermes' hand, he completely took. But we just watched the match with Devon's hand. Devon didn't really lose the wrist. I'm talking about the round one. Yeah, the first one.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah so we're just saying that if if lebanon couldn't get everything against devon can gennady do that
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, this will be huge. I think Genadi will not quit. And since Devon, like, provoked him with that cow thing, it was a bad, like, expression. Things didn't go so well for Devon the last time, like, he crashed the Georgii. No, joking, all joking aside, the match can go anywhere. Like, I don't know. I think Genadi is immune almost to Kane's move. He's powerful enough maybe to have, like,
SPEAKER_02: one big surge, and he has a very good stamina, but no one has a good stamina compared to Devon. But I don't know, man. I would still say Genadi wins. I would say Genadi wins. Genadi is going to win, you're saying? Yes, yes, I think so. I think he's explosive enough. He has stamina. He has a very good defensive style against Gensmo.
SPEAKER_02: and like he has his spirit the one you were talking about earlier i think the hunger you see within the younger guys like if it's foster and they look after it they will it will get to a place that's like similar gennady is about 40 years old but the only thing he will he will have is because devon is the most famous guy in the world yeah yeah the big beat beating him is just gonna
SPEAKER_02: like all the spotlights. I was saying like the younger guys with their hunger, if it's foster, it will get them to a place where Genadi is. Like having that like unrelenting spirit to go 100%. And the longer the match goes, Genadi gets somehow more powerful. But then I remember also then... Listen, listen, listen. Listen, listen. One second, one second. What did you just say? The longer match
SPEAKER_02: becomes and then Genadi becomes somehow stronger yeah yeah but like don't you think that you are giving this example at the wrong match I I know it's devil I know I mean come on man maybe what he's trying to say is like what's that like I think maybe what he's trying to say is like if Genadi is successful like if he gains any position he will
SPEAKER_01: He gets fired up. He gets more fired up, more fired up. But he has to have that successful positioning first. If he doesn't, then Engin is 100% right. The match will just move to Devon's side. I'm just thinking about the advantageous position. I mean, the thing is, what's the advantageous position? What is it exactly? Is it taking Devon's wrist? No. To hook him?
SPEAKER_02: No. For example, if he takes his wrist. Do you think he's going to take Devon's wrist? You think? Yes. Wow. If that happens, listen, listen, I'm not saying that it's not going to happen. But if that happens, I will be very surprised. Yeah, I think Devon might go to a King's move. And I think... What's King's move? You mean open arm top rope? Yeah, like without the shoulder or the humerus below the tail. Like in a defensive position. Just block him. Block the guy.
SPEAKER_02: yeah what were you saying continues i was saying like like if somehow gennady takes the center and devon stops him before the pad like he will try to like bleed him or something i think gennady knows how to deal with that
SPEAKER_02: Because I'd say Michael's move is more complete than Devon's. And if Genadi proved that he can deal with Michael on a King's move, I think he can also with Devon. I think so. I think he has enough power and enough experience how to do it. Oh, I don't know about that. Because I think the difference between, one of the differences between Michael's and Devon's open arm table is that
SPEAKER_01: I think Devon is much stronger at the center, but Michael has a really weird sticking point very near to the pad. I think if Genadi somehow gets Devon to that position where he's surviving a few centimeters above the pad, I think Genadi could press him. But the question is, can he get there? That's what I'm wondering. I remember someone mentioning something that you should ref the match. Engin, you mean.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, I can laugh. It's okay. I mean, because if I'm gonna receive all that, how to say, hate,
SPEAKER_02: yeah at least i need to go there and deserve it you know i'm not going to take the all the hate because of the mistake of the someone else at least if people said you made a mistake it would be the person that me but i will probably not make any mistakes i will just warn them i will just like i don't know but but i don't know if it's a good idea or not that that's the problem because yeah like often they go like oh
SPEAKER_02: Like, what's the guy name, you know, the UFC? Dana White. Dana White, yes. They're like, if you do something, if I do something, oh, Dana White doesn't do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Dana White is not me. You know, Dana White is Dana White. I am who I am. Yeah, I mean, he is probably much better than me about what he is doing. But I am more than a promoter. I don't think that he was, like, I don't know, was he like a legendary UFC fighter or something?
SPEAKER_02: i i not that i know i think no i don't need it i don't know i don't so much watch that but i mean yeah so why do i need to be like him why do i need i i hate to imitate him or something yeah yeah in my life it's the the worst original is better than the copy of the best thing else and just because the copy of besting is
SPEAKER_02: fake you know yeah yeah of course just be original of you whatever good bad you let people decide but just be yourself you know just i hate that one yeah my friend again like jeremy said dana white's here and you are like here then yeah you you are different i think you are way ahead of dana white in some aspects
SPEAKER_02: i mean for for my support for like for arm resting the things but i'm i'm sure he's incredible i mean i can be compared not to take anyway away from the guy he has a billion dollar business you know so i mean we are not there you know nothing you know but but i don't really i don't really care what he's doing like just focus on our message we know our missing let's let's make our missing great anyways guys you guys want to share
SPEAKER_02: like your opinions about anything else like like do you guys think how do you guys think do you like jerry and hermes and we have uh um lots of matches yeah yeah actually i had a question for you or for both of you regarding
SPEAKER_02: Rambam just thanks to let me take him back things. Rambam Shachar, Ph.D.: Okay, ask a question.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so I had a question, honestly, to both of you. Because when Artur Morozov revealed... I mean, he didn't reveal his game plan for Levan, but he dropped some hints, you know. And I was just going to ask you guys, were you surprised when he said that the hook was not going to be his first choice? And what do you think might be his... We are on YouTube. We never know what he says is true or not.
SPEAKER_02: even if it is not true we cannot call him a liar because he doesn't have to share his game plan you know he can say that way so we don't know but just remember hermes casparini did not directly die to lebanon's arm of course he went out and even tired his hand and then he went you know this way or that way but so what i just think that i don't see morals of top role in lebanon
SPEAKER_02: don't see that i don't see him side pressing the only thing i see a dive in a hook in a strap if possible yeah this is the only way but who knows you know who knows i mean no one expected the enemies to do what he did with the flood press for example yeah yeah so what i just say that like is this your complete question or your yeah no no that was it yeah yeah yeah i was i was i was i was
SPEAKER_02: surprised but it may not be the real answer so yeah and anything i think i think i should say again so they didn't hear me yeah i mean whatever you guys want to talk we can talk yes i i was i was thinking uh i think army's uh like i'm sorry uh morozov
SPEAKER_02: has a better stamina than hermes but hermes is way stronger i i would say i'm not sure if that will come into play because you know endurance only matters when the like the power levels are kind of even or close to each other but i think if he can like get into a position
SPEAKER_02: I think he can tire Levan and that will give him a really close one. Because also Morozov can adjust very smartly. I remember we were discussing his match with Tobias. As soon as he felt that he cannot go outside with him, he went into a hook and he was very successful with that. Not saying that he can hook Levan, but I think he may find something to capitalize on. And if stamina in any way comes into play,
SPEAKER_02: That favors Morozov, like stamina-wise. I think he's more of a... Some people say that no way that Hermes is way stronger than Morozov, they say. Hermes is stronger than Morozov in his own game plan. But about something like this, something like this, I cannot say the same thing. I don't see that, for example, Hermes is beating Morozov inside. I don't really see that one. But Hermes is about what he's doing.
SPEAKER_02: he's more effective but the thing is hermes wasn't super effective in his own game plan against levan of course he tired him with back pressure but eventually there was no way to win him this way you know yeah he had to go deep you know with bringing his shoulder you know hermes style is like except he's when he's finishing with shoulder pressure his main style is put this way
SPEAKER_02: with his shoulder hand this way but the way that he was effective at the end to bring his hand and shoulder forward yeah yeah but in that kind of way i don't think morozov is any weaker so i don't know if you should compare more of those top role with hermes's top role somehow the way that
SPEAKER_02: like Morozov hook in Revaz's round one right at the middle of the table, kind of just surprised me. If he can somehow do something, go in or go trap and do the same thing, but just keep these angles better because there he was just like moving so much like this. But if he can just do that move, especially like round one, I kind of feel that
SPEAKER_02: but if he does that like three rounds in a row yeah yeah break break or not I I don't know we are not talking about the like a computer game like Street Fighter we don't know this is real you know
SPEAKER_02: flesh and bone and power and everything. So, I mean, like, we just talk, talk, talk, but things may go different. Who would, as you said, you know, who would know that Hermes would travel Levan like this? Yeah, we only saw that as a finishing move, you know, either with full hand or with a flop finish like he did against Dave. But to go from the losing side like that, I mean, you could have asked anyone before the match. No one would have predicted that, you know.
SPEAKER_02: yeah and also where people where people are making a mistake is that they think that levan is vulnerable about dead risks it is not the same like exact case if hermes would try to do that right away he did it in round three he would get crushed herman said that round three when he put a break on
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah he said that after the foul he wanted to do that directly and that's why he get flushed so what he did following around or after the round he get another flush in the fifth round he did back pressure incredible back break and then stop to this way and then after he stopped no more no more heat and then he slowly come so that is the difference between going direct swap risk and then
SPEAKER_02: It was incredible. Just watch the match. How much back pressure Hermes applies before the goal. Incredible. And trust me, Levan's... 1,000 horsepower. Levan was holding, but trust me, he didn't have... Holding the pronators, not losing the wrist, and controlling the pronator are totally different things. Levan was fully pronated, but didn't have so much, you know, grip power because he was tired. He was holding good, but he didn't have really...
SPEAKER_02: pressure this way but he was mostly hanging back this is why he's opening like this yeah yeah yeah yeah makes me wonder man also like you said very interesting thing i think uh
SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure exactly the time, but you mentioned that Morozov is young and the development he showed, the quickness of his progress, he can show up very much stronger than what you saw against Rivas, which I think was his most recent match. This guy was exhausted. He pulled all year long. The guy was just
SPEAKER_02: exhausted you know he pulled in february he pulled in may yes mind-blowing was in november yeah the guy was exhausted still you know he did very well yeah yeah and now he has eight months from that time to do endo even even more than eight months the end of end of july the guy will be he said he's already 20 stronger than that time the guy is young he has now more experience and he has drive
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. And after, you know, just imagine yourself as a super heavyweight that you have a match with Levan. Imagine your psychology before Levan pulled Hermes. Now, after he pulled against Hermes. Now you see that, okay, this guy bleeds, you know, it's possible. If you put something sharp, the guy bleeds, you know. So he's human, you know. Yeah. Just like you said, very strong human, but still a human. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: know it makes me wonder man like also i think one of the matches that is set up for the next event is jerry versus ernest i know people are heavily opinionated on this one but i think it can be a close match i mean like we know all where army stands and but like jerry's style i'm not sure sometimes i doubt it because
SPEAKER_02: because Hermes has also a very good press. If he gets into the winning side and Jerry starts to adjust, I think Hermes will be smart enough to press him right away and not continue to drag him in a top form. I think this way... I don't know. Whenever you talk about Jerry,
SPEAKER_02: that I always see a danger. It is all up to you make a little mistake, you know? Yeah. I don't think the guy, I know this respect to Georgii Svetko. Georgii pulled great. I think he was incredible that match, but Jerry said that because of his shoulder injury, he was, he was super healthy because he rested long, but he was not really super, super, super performed. This is what he says.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I saw the picture. And just trust me, people are underestimating Gervis Wetko, but his top-rowing ability is incredible. Like, yeah, he's just... His back pressure and power. I don't know. I don't know. We will see. You are saying that Hermes is going to beat Jerry, right? If he doesn't go to a press, I think it will be very difficult. But I think he will.
SPEAKER_02: like he will take the center right right from the start or you mean no no no like ermis will first top roll him as soon as he gets uh jerry's hand closer to the pad and jerry will start to adjust but i think this will press because enemies has a very good finishing press very powerful so i will tell you something um devon also can do the the pressure
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah when he climbs up but then when devon did that right away against jerry at wal but not not after a couple of nights yeah so what i just tried to say that i i asked personally devon that he said that even for himself to be jerry with an outside move is
SPEAKER_02: not that easy he said you know yeah yeah it's really difficult i mean as you've been saying georgie's football is unbelievable but i think because he tried to like he continued trying to
SPEAKER_02: finish Jerry with a top roll rather than a press. That's why I think he didn't win. But Ermes has a very good press. I think he will take the center, move him closer to the pad, then he will climb. As soon as he climbs, I don't think Jerry can stop. Because at that point, he will be gripping him. How do you think it matched? Yeah, I think that is the main difference between Georgii and Ermes. Obviously, that Ermes has a
SPEAKER_01: uh yeah press finish which is a stylistic advantage that uh georgie was really lacking to finish the match but like you said and i think people really underestimate that like jerry wasn't an ideal or peak shape against georgie i think he will be much much stronger not only that but also much more motivated because this match has like a lot of history behind it uh and stuff like that and but i think stylistically the way they both pull i don't think
SPEAKER_01: any one of them will dominate. I think the polls will be long and yeah. Come on, if it is not, if it is not dominating match. Where do you think that match is going to go? You are absolutely right, but what I mean by domination. It really needs to dominate. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't think by domination, I mean,
SPEAKER_01: I think of like what Devon did to Jerry, stylistically dominating him, you know. I don't think Ernest will do that. I think he will go outside first. He will surge a couple of times, climb, and then go to the press.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if, of course, if it takes too long, then I absolutely agree. Jerry will, uh, was, uh, Jerry. Absolutely. Yeah. Although like, it means stamina is very, very good, but I think Jerry's stamina is unbelievable. Like a super heavyweight with that kind of stamina. That's crazy. Yeah. Like, yeah. And if he somehow gets close to the pad, then, uh, he should just lay down in my opinion. He shouldn't hold that in my opinion.
SPEAKER_02: Guys, I will be doing, this is the, I think, third program that I'm doing with the fans. And I think I did one on, what, Sunday or Saturday? Yeah. And then yesterday I did with Vitalii.
