SPEAKER_03: okay guys some of the names world's strangest man resources will be once every month is that a possibility for the future it totally depends you know like it i can do it only if you guys want to see that and uh support me
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Hello, Erlich. This is one of the biggest John Bridging fan. I promised him that I was going to invite him. Thank you. Hello, my friends. Yes, I'm fine. You hear me, Erlich? I can hear you. Can you hear me?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Yeah. I hear you. Yeah. How are you? I'm great. Thanks for having me. Thank you for coming. Thank you, my friend. Um, I think you are for sure. One of the biggest drum racing fan. And so you had to be here. I appreciate that. Not as big a fan as you, but you know,
SPEAKER_03: trying uh who knows who is the biggest fan you know i think that like i know i have been following you know your interests by the private messages you send it mostly about john and your ideas about john and yeah so i think that you had to be the biggest drum racing fan
SPEAKER_00: I saw Pulling John on YouTube. Never trained arm wrestling, never been an arm wrestler at all myself. Were you a fan before? I had seen it on ESPN once in a while. You were not really following? Not at all. The timing was kind of perfect because I watched Pulling John.
SPEAKER_00: and um wal you know came on the scene shortly thereafter and of course then game of arms and travis had a pretty big part in pulling john and i wasn't sure how i felt about travis you know he's over the top and very uh boisterous um and so then game of arms came out and he was the same way
SPEAKER_00: and it really piqued my interest and curiosity so i've only been really following the sport for probably about six seven years but um i really have dove deep into it and watched all the podcasts and everything i understand soon john will join us okay
SPEAKER_03: so since then since then you have been following and john is your hero i remember you have been giving me some uh suggestions about john yeah to ask to other arm masters what they think about him and things like this
SPEAKER_00: A consistent super chat I would do when you had people on was, you know, what has John Brzezink meant to their careers and what kind of impact that he has on them. And it was very consistent, you know. Everybody says the same thing. He's basically their hero. Yeah. Hey. Hello. It's Devon. Yeah, Devon.
SPEAKER_03: How do you exactly pronounce your name, Doug? Doug, yep, that's it. You got it right, man. Yeah, Doug is one of our VIP guests. I shouldn't say guests, sponsors for the East versus West 7. Oh, man. Yeah, he will be coming to Istanbul. That's awesome. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for doing this. It's a great opportunity to be a fan, right? This is the best way to do it, to show your support.
SPEAKER_00: I need to find somebody that would travel there with me. Everybody I present it to says that no. Oh, you mean to split the bill? Yeah, I agree. Yeah, not even necessarily the bill. Just I've got a friend who I've known for 20 years and he was over here last year helping me do a little project around my farm.
SPEAKER_00: And we got to talking afterwards and my, my fiance mentioned how obsessed I was with arm wrestling to him. And he said, you watch arm wrestling. I thought, oh boy here, I'm going to have to explain myself. You know, turned out he was a huge arm wrestling fan and he knew Devon Lorette and John and all these guys. And it was very shocking. And I've been trying to convince him to go. Got it. The gold is here.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, hey. Hey, John. Wow. I'm on. How do I get to everybody? I can see everybody. Hello, John. Hello, hello. Can you hear me? Yeah, we hear you. Cool. Hey, John. I haven't used this in a while.
SPEAKER_03: going on guys hey it's an honor man it's always an honor to see you to see the growth the goat pleasure you and devin man yeah these these guys are hardcore friends john so oh gotcha okay yeah i have been doing some this kind of things that i i bring a superstar and then like these guys normally
SPEAKER_03: follow from the chat room you know right but i just thought that it would be cool to invite them you know so that they would meet their uh favorite arm wrestlers especially eric eric is probably your biggest fan dang is also your fan but it's divided between devon and you so what's new in the arm wrestling world what is new in arm wrestling world uh
SPEAKER_02: I heard Alexi Wojola is making a comeback. Yeah, that's what I heard too. I actually got a phone call from Bob Brown. Hey, are you pulling Alexi? I'm like, I have to be quite honest, I don't know if I am or not. But if you've read it on the internet, then maybe it's true. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: What's going on here? Is this picking John? Is this called picking John movie now? This is insane. I'm glad that they want to test their coming out on me. I still feel very blessed and honored that I'm relevant enough that they think that I'd be a good test. It's cool. I see the opposite. They want to motivate you, John. Just kill them, man.
SPEAKER_03: kill alex but we'll see yeah we'll see yeah so it's set for october then again is that correct yeah okay do we have a specific date in october is it beginning of october we will find out soon very soon we will find out yeah gotcha yeah but but it needs to be good for you especially you are the goat you need to say that that's the green light
SPEAKER_02: Once you give the green light, we set it. Well, I don't have anything set up other than my commitment to pull Todd Hutchins in Canada. August 12th. I mean, yeah, he could definitely put a hurtin' on me, but I don't think it would last all the way until October, so I should be okay, right? Yeah, it's two months. Two months, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Thumb is sore still. Thumb is still sore. One of the guys that I trained with in the past came over to buy my motorcycle yesterday and he wanted to do a little pulling. I honestly haven't done anything since my match with Dennis.
SPEAKER_02: I knew it's been sore and I just wanted to kind of lay off on it, but we did a little bit of pulling. And of course, if I'm turning inside, it's not bothersome at all. But as soon as he went outside, I was like, oh shit, it's still, it's still, you know. That happened because of the accident, right? From snowmobiling. Yeah. I overextended it. I just basically came on the handlebars and jam my thumb because your thumb's open because that's where the throttle is at. So your hand is in this kind of position and I jam the throttle and it just twisted my, my, um,
SPEAKER_02: my thumb and wrist back you just know so yeah I just basically overextended it but um yeah I feel it I still feel it in the lower joint and then all the way into my wrists through here so yeah Erlich do you have do you have any question John you haven't pulled a Lexi since Zloty tour right
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and I don't even know what year that was, 2004, 2005. Yeah, I mean, he was very short-lived. I mean, I never really got a chance to, I mean, nobody really had a chance to pull him much after that. I don't think he competed too much, did he? Yeah, I mean, you would know better than I. I think he came back and pulled Michael Todd in 2007. Oh, that's correct. Yeah, that's correct. And then he pulled Tim Bresnan like some years ago. Yeah, just a few years ago. Yeah, that was kind of his comeback.
SPEAKER_02: that thing but yeah yeah yeah shoot uh that's what shoot that's almost coming up on 20 years right yeah 18 19 years it's amazing that um yeah time flies won't have a a war with taurus beforehand so i i suspect it'll be a better day for you um no eric eric it was not like that i i i think i i that that match was before
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Oh, it was. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the top match was after. I think he won against Taurus and John and then send them to B side and that the top match was on the B side. But it was different on the movie. Remember? Yeah, I mean, I should have pulled Taurus. I know I pulled Taurus once or twice, at least once before.
SPEAKER_02: I pulled Taurus probably the harder time, uh, in the overall. So yeah, again, it's probably correct that I did pull Taurus before that, but I think the, the tough one that everybody sees where he, uh, ends up taking my hand and wrist was during the, uh, during the overalls. Overall B side. Yeah. You, you beat him easy in the weight category, 95 kilo. Right. Yeah. And you, you control him and beat him. And then you, uh, he, he sent run back to B side and you send Taurus to.
SPEAKER_03: b side and then run also beating with a dead wrist dead wrist right and yeah yeah and then in the overalls you pull john and tell us as you pulled alexi and then let us pull alexi and the b side let us to go down here and then you you yeah
SPEAKER_02: Alexi, no matter what kind of shape he's in, which I'm assuming he's going to be in very tip-top shape, seeing that Tim actually beat him, I'm sure he's very aware that there's arm wrestlers out there that, you know, if he's not in top condition can beat him, but
SPEAKER_02: he'll be a tough challenge for me just because his hand and wrists are as strong, if not stronger in the areas that I normally dominate my matches so. Doing doing what I normally would do to 90% of the people i'm not going to be able to do to like see i'm almost going to probably have to develop my hooking ability, you know and maybe.
SPEAKER_02: possibly try to you know make sure that it gets turned into a hook at some point in the match because um yeah turning through pronating through his hand I mean there's probably I mean maybe Devon could do it there's very few people I think that will be able to I think your pronator is good enough for that I think yeah I don't know we'll try if you put the game to do like neutral wrist to neutral wrist position
SPEAKER_03: because he is good when he is using his wrist like some people like me the same you know we need to have the copy right but new all this way if you come to the same point like that like that you you put uh iraqli
SPEAKER_02: then yeah yeah you just need to know yeah i've kind of i've kind of evolved into that kind of arm wrestler i've never really been good at that that knuckles high back pressure type put pressure on my opponent's wrist for a length of time to try to you know to break through but it has worked the last well i run i seem to run out of gas it's not my old style where i would just dominate through like yeah top roll so um yeah it'll be interesting i'll be excited to do it for sure um you know it's still i told you doing this
SPEAKER_03: during those taras matches the taras was all the time he's incredible top roller but he was hitting from there so instead of trying to catch him and lose everything you were also pronated and you even you didn't have super risk control you were still beating with the pronated side pressure those years i remember you started develop and i saw you doing the same exact thing to dennis siplenko when you beat him in 2009 and he was pulling and you were still
SPEAKER_02: right right yeah right and i could pull that couldn't quite pull that off in dubai i mean i i felt like it was almost there it was close but um the amount of energy i was expending to try to establish that i i had no i had no gas left in the tank i mean he's he's in he's in good shape so it'll be an interesting match to see him and devin go at it i have a feeling devin will be able to outlast him though okay john i have a question for you since
SPEAKER_03: Dennis will have extra, say, almost eight months to train for Devon. We can expect that he will also come back a little bit stronger. In this case, how do you see that match?
SPEAKER_02: I still see, from what I felt from Dennis, I mean, of course, if he gets a lot stronger, then that's maybe possibly a different story. But I feel like Devon will be able to do what I was somewhat able to establish a lot better, a lot stronger, and Devon won't fatigue. He won't wear out. So I don't think Dennis...
SPEAKER_02: then it's going to have to develop a tremendous amount of cup. And he doesn't commit to hooking. He's kind of committing with his hand strength, but also staying outside. And I don't think you can outlast Devon doing that game. I think Devon will outlast him. But yeah, we'll see. I guess time will tell. But it looks like it's going to be a long war.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I just don't think Dennis is hit. He's going to have to really establish a good cup with Devon to be able to make his hit work. If his wrist is compromised at all, I'm not saying broke back, but just even flat, I don't think he possesses the power to beat Devon. Another question. We always see that Devon does his movement, and then he always has some cup in here, some wrist. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: yeah but because though dennis is also incredible lats and pronators i'm sure that he will become stronger what if he also neutralizes devon's wrist will devon be as effective as he is against other guys when he is finally having
SPEAKER_02: I think so just because the devins build he's he's taller he's got longer levers he can he can actually naturally kind of almost relax there without putting a lot of different pressure or or changing the pressures up quite a bit because of his his uh dominance on his you know the height
SPEAKER_02: um so i think he's always going to have the high ground on dennis um and like i said devin steven's endurance is off the chart so i i don't i don't see him failing that respect i mean i don't think he's i don't think he's going to be able to flash dennis um but um i think he'll definitely outlast him yeah yeah the only only thing on my mind will devon be the same if he somehow loses his wrist his endurance will be as effective
SPEAKER_03: And I don't think he's gonna, I don't think he will lose his wrist. I think Devon is strong enough and smart enough to even pull if his hand for him and his cup went away, his pronator will still be there and he'll have the high ground. Yeah, yeah, that's for sure. He will have his pronators because you were able to protect your pronators whenever Dennis was trying to go. You were also stopping him. I saw that. Yeah, yeah. But I kind of think that after I saw Dennis' some,
SPEAKER_02: training videos and yeah obviously it depends it depends on which dev or uh dentist shows up i mean if it's a dentist that's the you know monster that pulled devin left-handed
SPEAKER_02: And, you know, all bets are off. I mean, then I think that... But even Devon is not the same Devon of 2008. No, Devon's way stronger. But I think that Dennis could possibly just overpower him and put Devon in a, you know, his cup would be so strong. He's going to have to have the type of cup that LeVon has. I mean...
SPEAKER_02: That's the thing that is going to need to be there to shut Devon's pronator move down right now. He's developed that one specific spot with that back pressure and that pronator that it shuts down 99% of the arm muscles. I don't care how strong they are. You've got to have that hand and wrist and cup to be there to be able to establish your arm strength.
SPEAKER_03: um if Dennis can do that then yeah Dennis is plenty strong enough to beat him I think his limiting factor will be his his hand obviously right so you are saying that there is no way that Dennis can beat Devon purely outside move he needs to control Devon's tornado and dominate him inside pressure
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and he's going to have to be quite a bit stronger. I mean, I don't even think that Dennis, if he hooked Devon, it was able to hook Devon. I don't think he'd be able to pin him. I didn't feel that from Dennis. It wasn't overwhelming, his hook power. Do you think that he changed his playing style a little bit?
SPEAKER_02: compared to before that he was holding and more like this now. I never got a chance to pull him very much after our super match. I mean, he beat me, I think, a couple, three years later as Lottie overall. But yeah, I never really got a chance to just see what he was all about in the 10, 12, 15 years that he was real dominant.
SPEAKER_02: It's hard to know. It's hard to say. I mean, I saw him, I mean, even when he was in his quote-unquote prime Dennis shape, I mean, he struggled with Michael Todd. He struggled with Richard Lepkus. So, yeah, I mean, he was a normal guy, right? I mean, there was guys that could be competitive against him. Yeah, yeah. He always struggled with Pushkar, even though at the end he beat him. But always a problem always ended up here. And then from there, with
SPEAKER_02: right so he wasn't he wasn't just so incredibly super dominant like like levon is currently so yeah yeah guys he might not be far off from what he used to be then so i mean i just we most of us go by the looks right and we just see oh remember back then how big he was but that doesn't necessarily mean that he was a stronger better arm wrestler yeah yeah i i
SPEAKER_02: I think Devon prepared for Dennis with that thumb exercise. I mean, it's all planning for Dennis, in my opinion, because John, the way he... Go ahead. He's just completely changed and established super strong. It's not a King's move anymore. It's just a super strong pronation in an upright position that...
SPEAKER_02: that's going to just shut down 99.9% of all the best arm wrestlers. Even if they are stronger, they can't use their strength because of that pronation that Devon's established. What do you think about this? I think Devon's only susceptibility that I see
SPEAKER_00: is somebody that's really strong out of the gates like a prudnik and then a lavon i think if he gets into a long game there's not many people on the planet that could beat devin lorette in his current form you know someone needs someone needs to be strong enough to to cop him
SPEAKER_02: And then, because of his long levers get his palm this way and then be able to roll on his hand completely so it's going to almost need to be like a hook almost a drive down. cup to get rid of that pro nader so move it from this point to this point and then then he's top rollable but. yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Joseph DiCarlo, M.D.A.: That are that are. Joseph DiCarlo, M.D.A.: Couldn't couldn't couldn't do it so there's I don't know if there's anybody other than live on that's got that commitment to cop and cup and then roll. Joseph DiCarlo, M.D.A.: cup and then top row. John I don't think that you know it is that possible to copy him like this, you know when you try to copy him like this.
SPEAKER_03: if devon has any opportunity to copy a little bit you are in going into the trap that you know he will be even hitting you harder so my my my my belief is that even you want to copy him you need to not to get out of his over pronation but you need to a little bit keep here tight your with your tornado to keep his wrist neutral position because when your wrist is like this you can generate
SPEAKER_02: much stronger pronation when your wrist is like barely holding you it's just hard to you know i didn't say it was going to be easy but i just i i just know from experience that um top rolling devon in an outside move when he's still kind of flat-handed at all is a near impossibility he's going to outlast anybody doing that you have you have to establish the getting driving and putting his hand
SPEAKER_03: no no i didn't answer you it's gonna be easy but i just want to say that i think the best way to help someone like you need to apply some back pressure to keep his wrist flat and then then cup and then you know yeah yeah yeah because if you are letting here a little bit loose the guy is gonna
SPEAKER_03: pull you there i don't think it matters if somebody was able to really establish and get down on his wrist where he was had to commit to a hook i mean yes it's going to be a lot harder to top from from that completely wound in position because the more you go like this more he is able to pull you to his side so that's why i think that you need to keep you a little bit tight left to left and then then you know you will kind of stop him to drag you because more you die more he's
SPEAKER_02: You know, pulling you to his angle. I just know what's effective for me. I'll leave it as that. I got it in my brain. I know exactly what I would have to do. The way that you pull him
SPEAKER_03: in dubai the round one you went that way you went with the pronator control from here your wrist start to like yeah i didn't have the hand and wrist the cup cup yeah yeah yeah that pronator yeah as much as i needed but you remember his wrist was also a little bit moving back you know when he came here you know yeah and devon told me that you had an opportunity for a second to just
SPEAKER_02: to do a transition and then press him. I don't know. Yeah, no, my brain was all messed up. I was, I had told myself if he had stopped the match that I was going to just give up and then do another restart, you know, but I let it go, you know, even just seconds too long. And I was, you know, it was the end of me. So I should have been more aggressive on the first match and just try to establish a win some way somehow. But yeah, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Just think, John, just think that it is 1999. And then, John, I'm pulling today's Devon. You would pull, as you said, you would just a little bit go like a little bit hook and then run it out. Yeah, the hand and wrist just has to be a lot stronger for Devon.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I think my arm is plenty strong still. It's just establishing that, you know, correct position with the hand and wrist and forearm. I mean, it's still key in the sport. Another question. You pulled him, you brought him like that close to pad round one. And you were just making comeback. It was like probably four months or five months after you made a comeback. Just imagine that 2006 Vegas.
SPEAKER_03: john you remember those years you know and and to me that that would end and on the path you know but the question that i will ask you like if it was a six round super match like how do you even even then yeah it would be very tough i mean obviously i was in probably one of the best shapes of my life believe it or not even though i was only
SPEAKER_02: 220 at the uh for the last time we pulled in vegas in 2015-16 i came in um actually training with weights i was like eight months of uh doing you know everything i could do to be and i was in really good shape and you know he obviously beat me the second match with the second match of the day and um i i was i was like
SPEAKER_02: like that son of a gun he's going to beat me get it now do me and um yeah six rounds even even that devon at 220 um it would have been tough to beat and i was in the very best shape of my life so yeah he's he's gonna he's a he's gonna be extremely tough right six or six rounds is yeah just suits him so well his his uh his strengths yeah there is another supporter jeremy coleman
SPEAKER_00: Thanks for all you're doing again. John, you should start an arm wrestling apparel and call it Goat Gear. Great idea. The Goat Gear. John has unlimited opportunities if he truly wants to retire. He can do YouTube and live off of Super Chats. He could probably license his name to handles.
SPEAKER_02: He could have an apparel line. I think John's got more opportunity than he gives himself credit for. My mind is still, I guess, back in what I know arm wrestling was 10, 15, 20 years ago. So it's hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that there's actually thousands of people out there that follow and enjoy arm wrestling. I still feel like I'm kind of still in the era of there's not very many people out there. Well, John, I
SPEAKER_01: think you're thinking that the wrong way in a businessman point of view if you could have 60 something is better than 100 nothing right so have a partner who does 40 of all the marketing apparel they do all the organization you just sell your brand your name that's it you make 60 they make 40
SPEAKER_02: then right away when you make the money i mean that's passive income if anybody's approached me on that those kind of ideas i've always been very open like just hey yeah go for it so um i don't know if i would do it myself i mean i'd have to distribute it right i'd have to be i did the free t-shirts for a couple years back when we were doing the ing and john thing if you remember and that's kind of a pain in the butt john is not that type of guy john john
SPEAKER_02: john likes to do what he wants to do you know just like my free time is very important to me and I may call it, you can call it being lazy, but I just you know I value my quiet time my privacy and my free, especially now right.
SPEAKER_03: Then, then maybe like 1520 years ago, you would have probably more of a go getter, right? Yeah. Yeah. More, it would excite you to do something right now. I see that you want to be with your family, grandkids go there. Go. Yeah. Yeah. This is what it is. I, I think that this is what fits you the best as though now just arm wrestle whenever you want a vacation, whenever you want, just not like, you know,
SPEAKER_03: Like full-time arm wrestling, I remember what you just posted and you said there is another world outside of arm wrestling. That gives so much idea about how you feel right now. I wish I had the excitement and the motivation that I did and the team around me to really
SPEAKER_02: hold me accountable to train every, you know, at least once a week or twice a week. But, yeah, that's also kind of maybe it's my fault, too, that I don't establish that. Any plan moving from Arizona to somewhere else? No, no, I like Arizona. Yeah, I really like Arizona. In fact, yeah, I would love to see my family from Utah move down here eventually, but we'll see. I mean, I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, no, I don't see myself moving from Arizona. When I retire, when I leave Delta, maybe I'll get out of the Valley and maybe move out in the country a little bit more. There's no reason to be in the city when you don't have to commute to a job, but I do- John, do you- I got a question. Shoot. Go ahead. So, John, based on your recent match with Uncle Bayef,
SPEAKER_01: iraqli you know that you lost to it seemed like the mindset is your is your main problem right you say yeah come in with a plan and then you scrub that plan in the middle of the match and you went to another plan you think is better could it be that no you are your own worst enemy when it comes to a match-up in the middle of the match because you know you have done who told you that he changed at the middle of the match distribution yeah but both of both of my matches with questions
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, both of my matches with Ongarbaev and Arekli were about basically just running out of gas. I just ran out of energy. Ongarbaev, I mean, I lost, I just feel like in my own mind, maybe people will argue with me, but
SPEAKER_02: I felt like I lost it just because of the second round. I didn't get a good, clean, aggressive offensive start with him on the second round. And then I continued to fight from a bad position that I thought that I could still recover from and win.
SPEAKER_02: And I just don't, I don't have the gas tank like I did in my younger years where I, you know, especially in a six round format where I'm back up at the table, you know, gripping up in a minute, minute and a half. It's just, it's just not there anymore. It's not in the cars for anymore. So I was very frustrated with Unger Baye because I felt like I was, if I stayed crisp and I was fresh, I had the chance to, to, to win even three matches against him. But because of that second one and in the way I've,
SPEAKER_02: continue to fight and thinking okay i can still still pull this off it basically it basically you know messed me up directly i was i went into a little you know smarter knowing that that was going to be the case uh
SPEAKER_02: It was a surprise, right? Here again, I just ran out of gas. I felt like once I established that position, I felt like I was in a safe position. I thought I could almost relax. And yeah, I mean, the first time he beat me, it just shocked me that he was committed that hard. And I didn't, I didn't expect that kind of power. I should have because Zurov did the same thing to me. I'm so, I mean, I knew it was a possibility, but in the, in the,
SPEAKER_03: John Murphy, In the past, anytime i've established that I feel I felt pretty confident rock solid right and just take a breath and just let them believe themselves out but so yeah surprising but john. John Murphy, I asked yesterday to get ugly and he said that it was none of his plans, you know, like he never even thought that he would do such thing he never even.
SPEAKER_03: planned, he never even give any possibility for such thing. The question I want to ask you, do you think that when you talk about endurance now, like what before Ongarbaev match and Irakli matches, this, like you had some kind of
SPEAKER_03: health issues about breathing you know you you cut cold you know you and i we we keep in touch through whatsapp and yeah okay you you didn't want me to say but you had that kind of issues do you think that it is it has anything to do that because you are not at your time right now as good as when you were young endurance or is that did it have to
SPEAKER_02: do anything with the condition that you are in, in those times? I mean, yeah, the condition maybe had a little bit to do with it. But I'm not going to use that. I mean, I feel like because even just during even in practice, I can tell like, in the past, in my younger years, and 30s and 40s, I could arm wrestle for hours and not feel like I've yet come down very much.
SPEAKER_02: Now I pull for 1520 minutes and i'm ready to quit training, I mean I was like i'm exhausted guys nothing's working anymore it's it's just it's. i've got enough work, I feel like i've gotten enough work and I can't really sustain that that that that lock and that strength to continue pulling for hours, so I know I know it's me it's. yeah about your message. For us, like we call us match. You also.
SPEAKER_03: got out of gas but you were able to finish is it because corey's endurance wasn't as good as yours or you think that still you know it has had to do anything with your condition at that time i felt i felt just as faint with corey as i did with both anger by him indirectly i mean um
SPEAKER_02: All three of those matches, to be quite honest, had me feeling like more than, you know, obviously my muscles, you know, ran out of gas, but I also felt like it was oxygen problem, like my oxygen level wasn't what it should be because I felt actually my head was actually faint. You know, I was like, oh, a little dizzy. I'm going to fall over somewhere to catch me. Yeah, yeah. Another question, if four months later,
SPEAKER_03: There is a match that if you win, the condition is only winning. You make $50,000, you lose, you don't make any money. Would you choose to pull Irakli or Ongar Bayev?
SPEAKER_02: I think you would try to get active. And I think, yeah, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq
SPEAKER_02: endurance game that I think he possesses I think he's just as dangerous as Devon is when it comes to endurance so if the match if the match stops at all I think Iraq lay is in big trouble but I think Iraq Lee could possibly have I think his hit was better and harder than my hit was
SPEAKER_02: um obviously he he took me off my center of the first match so yeah yeah i think his ability as his explosivity and his his power is exceeds mine so i think there is a very good chance that he's going to be able to do that but no no we will we will go there we will go there those matches but i wasn't asking you but i think that from what i understand there are problems with ongarware
SPEAKER_03: for you and there are problems with it actually but on the paper it looks easier to fix the problem with directly than fixing because with ongar web you do not know that's all about hand position back pressure to back pressure it is just like to build the hand
SPEAKER_02: maybe harder than you know if i if i if i cross that line with ungrab i'm done i mean if i if i let myself get fatigued at all i'm done with the rock lay i still think i can fight a good fight even though especially now when you know that what can happen yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah yeah it'd be more question on that go ahead um from a pride perspective this for ingen and john
SPEAKER_00: the intentional elbow fouls. What do you guys feel like that? I've never seen John do that in a losing position.
SPEAKER_00: Um, and I feel like that might've just been enough for Irakli to turn that match around. Was the, you know, the couple of times John got him back over to his side and it looked like John was going to secure the round. Irakli gives him an intentional elbow foul. What are your guys' opinions? It's, it's legal tactic though. I mean, right. It's playing within the rules and it's everything that, I mean, that's what good athletes do. I wish I was that aware to be able to do that.
SPEAKER_03: we need to go devon school that's what happened john yeah there was a super chat gb19 is devon versus dennis at the same event as john versus alexi yes oh wow okay awesome news i will tell you what that that stage would probably collapse from the greatness
SPEAKER_02: oh man yeah i have another question definitely dennis is doing a really great job with his social presence i need i need to step my game up if i uh yeah for the for that match with alexi hopefully alexi i know he's kind of somewhat in dennis's camp now so i'm sure that the uh the excitement will definitely be there for can you imagine this training here look at looking here devon and john well dennis and alexi wow
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Are they going to start training together? I'm assuming Alexi lives somewhat close to Dennis. I just don't know how close. Let me answer that privately to you. Okay. All right. We can't make it public. All right. That's cool. I got a question for John, if you don't mind. Uh-huh. John, like I said, back to the question I said with the mental preparation, have you had any mental preparation in every one of your match? Because, you know, every athlete, when they, like, no, they've been pulling a nollie, right?
SPEAKER_01: You can bet that Devon's watching every video of how Genadi pulled. And he has a game plan coming in.
SPEAKER_02: and then he's gonna execute a game plan without fail. Maybe that's why. The question is, no, no, John, because we are gonna now predict the matches. Yeah. But as far as game plans go, I've arm wrestled so long at such a young age that I try not to think, overthink matches, especially wear myself out with worrying about
SPEAKER_02: how or what i'm going to do i've i've learned a long long time ago that it's better just to be going in with uh open mind and just let things just happen naturally and just um yeah so yeah i don't i don't think think think thing things through it nearly as much as people might think like oh i'm you know concentrating and studying and game plan and i got all these things that i mean i wish i could say i do that but uh
SPEAKER_02: John Murphy, it's taxing it wears me out, so I just I go in and say ask whatever happens happens, and I hopefully my experience will just automatically go on autopilot and just do the right things but. John Murphy, yeah sometimes it doesn't happen that way, and you go shit I wish I would have but it's all it's all learning experience, I mean I hope, hopefully it sticks with me a little bit for the next time. yeah okay let's let's go to the predictions and. We can end it okay john.
SPEAKER_03: Let's start with Rob Vision Jr. Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Um, Rob just has to watch video of, uh, what happened with, uh, with chance. I mean, I think if Rob hits his top role perfectly studies and doesn't over top role, um, I think he's strong enough and has the tools to possibly flash pins or up. If the match stops at all, Rob is going to be in trouble. Zara is a fighter and, um,
SPEAKER_02: know he's not a jerry catarat but he is extremely strong with with do you do you think he can still press him with that no i think i think if he over top rolls zurab zurab will jam what like jerry does with a dead wrist and it'll be very very difficult for rob to win from that point i think rob's rob's best chances are to be fluid and that middle ground top roll
SPEAKER_02: directly to the pad off those two rounds that you won against europe yeah yeah yeah well and one chance to do them right if uh as europe stops the match it'll be tough so it'll be exciting i mean it could go it could go either way it's uh but i think it's i think it's rob's to lose i mean i think rob is probably in my mind a little bit of the favorite if he does everything right yeah and and don how you see that match uh
SPEAKER_01: I saw you zero web match. I saw Sasho much against, uh, against Rob. If it, if it goes by WAF rule, I think Bob will win because he can't slip under, you know what I'm saying? He can get losing position. He lose, but with this, with the, with the, with the, with the slip also go to strap. I think it's razor. I've got this in my opinion, because the hook that the way he, he, he, his styles with, with Sasho, the same thing. I don't see how well what I was going to win, you know, unless grew up coming super strong, but in my opinion is where I've won this.
SPEAKER_00: And you, Erlich? I would say it's 50-50. You know, Rob looks like he's training more. He's more dedicated. So I'd certainly like to see Rob win. Zurab is a tough test. So I would say it's a 50-50 either way. Yeah. John, did you hear about Zurab's victory in AMC events? No, huh?
SPEAKER_03: You remember there was a Chechnya event? Okay. I didn't know that. They organized it somewhere else this time. And Zurab went there and won 95 kilo beating all the other guys from Russia. Give me some big names. I don't know a lot of the big names in Russia. And John Prokopchik versus Doug Erlich. That little shit.
SPEAKER_02: daniel right it's daniel right daniel i i just know daniel i i've never uh our muscle ducks i really don't know his strengths or what he what he has as far as you remember his last match against ray yeah it looked very good i mean super strong he said that now he's much stronger because he's coming back he's just coming back so he said he's i mean
SPEAKER_02: 15% it's super hard for me to comment, just because I don't know the level, but I know Daniel and and I wouldn't want to pull the annual I mean there's certain spots that he could possibly get me into and i'd be like in bad bad trouble, so if Doug is able to pull it off, I mean wow. yeah.
SPEAKER_02: James Forrest, Norcal PTACC, he, his, his, his. James Forrest, Norcal PTACC, he, his, his. James Forrest, Norcal PTACC, he, his, his. James Forrest, Norcal PTACC, he, his, his.
SPEAKER_01: I think does the underdog as always late, because you know I think that if we go to the strap maybe Ray could have been a better but Ray on this made him that day, and I think Doug is a wild horse because. All Daniel preparation matches out there, he can study them yeah i'm saying he can study Daniel stay with position he's bad I was good at, and he can actually get them out position so he's an underdog to me, so I think Daniel 60 and 40.
SPEAKER_00: And you, Erlich? When I watch Daniel, Daniel's polls a lot like Dennis pulled against John. He kind of hangs out out here and hangs people up. And I think that's going to be a long day for Doug. I think 70-30. I hate to say it, but I think Daniel's overwhelming favorite.
SPEAKER_03: Daniel Campbell in many different styles. Top roll, hook, dead wrist. He does, but I just noticed he gets people hung out. It reminds me a lot of what I saw with Dennis versus John recently. Yeah, I think you're talking about Corey Miller match. That is how he looked. Specifically, yep. John, Ali John Muratov versus Kody Merritt.
SPEAKER_03: Devon't I can't even pronounce his name, so I don't know anything about the is he Russian or. Remember the Kazakh guy to pull all the time. Oh okay. Okay, I do remember him to very. Oh yeah. The guy was 95 kilo john. You want to watch super super heavyweight. wow right.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so I don't know. Kody's good. Kody's good. I got to root for Kody, obviously. It just depends on what version of Kody comes in. Kody's been struggling with little aches and pains here over the last couple, three years, so...
SPEAKER_02: If he's full force and healed up, he's a lot to handle. But yeah, no, that other kid definitely was very impressive against Petrenko. Do you remember this match with Oleg Petrenko? Of course. Yeah, yeah. And I thought Petrenko was very impressed. Oh, yeah. Especially when Petrenko just killed Zurab left hand. I thought, well, Oleg's on just another level lefty. And then this other kid beat him. So yeah, no, very impressive. Two years ago in a Russian event,
SPEAKER_03: This Alejan won the overalls where Morozov was like third or fourth place, left down after him. Of course, that Morozov wasn't the Morozov today, but still, you know, the guy is something else. So he's from Kagazine. What is that trip to Turkey? Is it an hour, hour and a half, two hours? No, no, no. Probably minimum five hours. Oh, five hours. Oh, shit. Probably, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I was going to, I was going to, you know, say that it's, you know, it's tough for a big man like Kody too. You got to put, you know, factor that in that travel, you know, 18, 19, 20 hours from the States to the Turkey like that and try to get on the right. Yeah. He's from the other side, like the guys from New York side, seven, eight hours, they just. Right. I'm not sure which is better though, because the matches that are Saturday night are kind of like our morning.
SPEAKER_03: which we should be wide awake right um for for the kazakhstanians i mean it would be like pulling at three four in the morning right it's the other direction 10 o'clock so it is like 1am if they are pulling 11 o'clock it's 4am in kazakhstan right right so yeah which is worse ahead yeah yeah and what do you think done i think it's just you know the casa said they live eat and breathe
SPEAKER_01: and, you know, sleep with arm wrestling. And this guy is a full-time arm wrestler, right? No, I think he's working. The other day, he was telling me to send him something like imitation or something. Oh, okay. So the job would let him go, yeah. Okay, yeah. Regardless, I think Kody is underdog, and I think Alexander is going to take this. He's just too fast, too explosive. He has so many waves going in. And Kody, if Kody gets his hand,
SPEAKER_01: and and and top of them like that yeah cody have a chance but even with that he can still flop with and do some other things i don't think so i don't think he can beat cody with floppers but if he hooks him quickly then
SPEAKER_02: Anything possible. Yes. I look away. What did the John. So you don't know that yet. You know, when they push the limit, you know what I'm saying? They will try to listen. I don't know that, but you don't know either. And it seems like a new thing, right? People will get it in the back of their mind, at least that they could still possibly flop, risk, press. I mean, yeah, after we saw you like me in this world, anything is possible. Well, even not even Iraq. We look at what
SPEAKER_03: Ermes. Ermes did the Le Mans. Yeah, but John, if anyone is thinking that that was a success or flop risk, it's wrong. The guy did tremendous back pressure, back pressure, neutralized Le Mans. Le Mans only pronated. He didn't have any copy. Right. And then...
SPEAKER_03: then right now i'm sure for sure it wore him down yeah the back pressure wore him down enough where that was successful yeah for someone to think that they could do that fresh against the lawn is is highly mistaken right yeah for sure yeah maybe jerry but or should not die because aramis said that he when he stopped him i think round three and then he was like oh okay let me do that directly and then he got flushed
SPEAKER_03: right because because he didn't put any pressure to let one's wrist and that one had the full wrist you know so you need to really make the wrist tired right but if you realize that he didn't have any copy he only over pronated like this yeah and he was on his it's nice to know that levon hanging out like this does does wear out though i mean it's it's because yeah yeah exciting for the rest of the arm arm strength was right here yeah
SPEAKER_03: i've been saying it for years i know i know urbeez is like yeah yeah i'm very happy i'm very happy like three four years ago these guys were not really like at that time hermes lost against matt mask everyone was making fun with him practice champion practice champion iraqi was just like it took third place or second in the 75 kilo mindagos wasn't champion i was talking about these guys to be the next superstars
SPEAKER_00: And the last event, Mindaugas pulled an idle match. Irakli pulled against you. And now Ermes is second in the world, looks like, right? Right. And Erlich, how do you see this match, Ali-Chan versus Kody? I think Kody's got a hard match. He's definitely the underdog. He's the nicest guy in the world, so I wish he would win. But I think it's going to be a tough match. I think he's probably like a 40% underdog.
SPEAKER_03: mm-hmm okay so let's go another one arif versus de serrano john de serrano is the guy that beat kalinishenko and wagner he beat both of them three so you remember he almost
SPEAKER_02: I don't know I don't know I can't even begin to comment on I didn't know I know I don't know either one of these guys I have no experience against them I don't I mean. Arif is the one pull against Corey. Of course yeah. yeah yeah. Very impressive I mean from what I see against Corey I mean he's yeah. yeah well it's hard to gauge for you. yeah impossible to gauge for me, I mean i'm assuming yeah so i'm not going to comment.
SPEAKER_03: You know better than I do, Inge, and it's going to be a good match. Oh, yeah, but I invite you guys here. I can just come in and reach out to you guys and say, I'm curious about what you guys think, but it's normal. If you don't know much about them, it's hard to say something. You may say something, but it is just like... Just completely out of the air. Yeah, I just say, I think this guy wins. You know, listen, John.
SPEAKER_03: For people like you, it is harder to predict a match that without knowing. It's easier for some other people that don't know much about, but just say, like, this guy wins, you know. At least I was there to visually see them live. I should be more of an expert than, you know, most people. Yeah, but hard to compare, you know, because they didn't pull against the same guys and things like, yeah. And, Dan, how do you see this one? Ah.
SPEAKER_01: Erlich Glymphs, Our all day too fast way too fast, if you see them asking me to go. Erlich Glymphs, So he was slow and he might finally get in there, but whatever the top row is so fast, even corey's our position so fast, I was going to speed them please Oh, in my opinion, this that's why I see. I understand Erlich.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know enough about the second guy. I've seen Arif on your events several times. He's very impressive, but I couldn't give a prediction. I'm like, John. You don't remember this. I don't know. The pull East versus West five. He pulled against Wagner Bortolato. Oh, okay. Yeah. The Kazakh guy, they also beat same event. He beat Kalnyshenko from Ukraine. Okay. Yeah. He was losing 2-0, and then he came 3-2.
SPEAKER_01: It should be a good match. I'd say, you know, it should be a very close match, but I wouldn't have a pick either way. Is there a cash weight, Tengen? Is there a cash weight? Is there a cash weight for those two? No, no, no, it's just super heavyweight. Super heavyweight, yeah. Yeah, so like... They cannot be limited to how hard it is, 150 kilos. Yeah, exactly. And how much is Kalitenko? He's like 110, 115?
SPEAKER_03: no he is he will be around 125 but trust me after certain weight like it still helps but most of that is overweight you understand like like not really yeah i'm not like i don't know man but somebody have a like about 70 pound over you i mean that's a lot of weight that's a big weight difference you know yeah 25 kilo i think it's about what 56 pounds yeah and how do you see john brandon assessor versus samusha
SPEAKER_02: We come into last four matches after this one. Yeah, here again, I know no experience pulling Brandon. I've just seen what he's done lately against other people. It's a right-handed match, right? Yes. And Davit, he's the one that pulled Paul in the last time, right? Or no, that was the match before he pulled Babaya. He pulled Paul in May. He lost 3-2. Right. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: and then he beat uh mojidar and then he beat daniel prokopchuk right and then last event he beat craig tuller julian yeah so yeah obviously very strong very formidable um just depends on how good brandon's coming in i mean um i've seen him pull jordan sill i'll top roll him so if he's in good he toppled jordan seal
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, if he's in good shape and he's top rolls on, I mean, I think he's got, you know, chances, but here again, uh,
SPEAKER_03: Devon't know. I have to say. Yeah. Yeah. Trust me, John. Trust me. I wouldn't be betting any money on either one of these guys. Yeah. Trust me, John. None of us know. That is why. That's the beauty of it. We are. Yes, yes. That's the beauty that we are bringing to wars. And then we are trying to find out, you know, and as you see, there has been many. The problem is I don't know. I don't know enough about them even to say, oh, in my mind, I could see this happening or I could see that happening because I just don't even really know, you know, how they would, how they're going to even mesh that I could, you know,
SPEAKER_02: James Meeker- A lot of the guys that i've had experience with you know if i've had experience on both sides, I can say oh Okay, well, this is the key to victory to this guy, because if he just does a little bit of this he's going to be able to overwhelm this other guy but. James Meeker- In this situation, I just have no idea what their strengths and weaknesses are to see how. yeah. and then. So I see this way, a lot of factor against brandon right overseas first time on the big screen, you know deadlines.
SPEAKER_01: You know, all that and cut, weight cut, weight cut like crazy. I think he's walking, he got cut like 20 pounds, 20 something pounds to get to the beat time. So that's going to all affect his endurance, his stamina, his mental state of mind. First of all, he has a king move, a king's move too against Davit, right? But you forget Davit is training with the Georgii. They know how to kill a king move. So in my opinion, Davit, you know, is a heavy favorite in this matchup because the weight cut alone is going to kill him.
SPEAKER_03: you know he's like the 220 guy i think he's walking around like 220 you know so my opinion is that he's gonna cut like 10 pounds water in the last moment and then i i can tell you the event is 187 but i guarantee you the guy will be minimum 205 on the event time you know he has to cut to 185 right 87 yeah
SPEAKER_01: 187, so that's about 20 pounds. You know what I'm saying? Water weight, I don't know. He's going to put the 20 pounds on, I guarantee. You will see. I hope so. I mean, I'm rooting for the American, but it's a heavy favorite for Davit. Just all the styles, you know, the weight cut and different, first time on a big stage. The jitters can get to butterflies, can get to your, you know, and in my opinion, yeah, the Georgii have a very, you know, they vary together, you know, they have each other.
SPEAKER_00: They studied the move and, you know, it's, it's against Brian and his point. You were saying something, John, almost, or no, no, I'm just okay. Erlich. I think it's a little closer. Good points by the way. Yeah, I think it's a little closer than dung. Thanks. Um, I mean, we've got some commonalities in Craig Tulia and the Brandon, a seltzer Craig match was very close at the monster factory.
SPEAKER_00: Um, but I think Brandon's the larger man, which hopefully after rehydration, you know, helps him rather than hurts him with the cut. Um, I would say to beats probably still got a little bit of an edge in terms of who's the favorite, but I think Brandon's going to do better than what you say. Brandon's sticky. You can get them in losing positions and he's hard to finish it seems. So, um, I'd say it's like 55, 45.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, living being and putting on pounds after doesn't mean much when the pot kills you. Oh, thank you for education, my friend. I didn't cut weights for like 30 years, my friend. And trust me, I know a little more than you do.
SPEAKER_03: but i i i used to do it the wrong way all the time i would starve myself for weeks and like there's a there's a definitely a better way to to do the uh the checking the body and over over you know i was 187 i cut down to 143 at 2018 wars from 187 143 i want to watch my guy i want the world so if you know how to do it my friend maybe privately reach me i can
SPEAKER_03: tell you how to do yeah anyway so let's go let's go to yeah i love it when people are acting like you know i don't know what these things you know engine you know you should know that it's okay uh pauline versus sasha john oh
SPEAKER_02: If it goes inside, I think Paul's strong enough to possibly hang. I don't know if he's going to have the endurance that Sasho is going to have. I think Sasho's probably better built for a long, hard match and a hook.
SPEAKER_02: there any possibility it will not be a hard match i i don't think i don't think paul is going to be able to uh top row because sasha was able to to control rob so i think his wrist cupping and wrist flexion is going to be enough to probably make force the match go to go inside but paul lynn's still a beast even inside um he's you know yeah obviously he's he's a few notches over even uh probably ron bath now i mean i think if he's
SPEAKER_02: if he continues to get better like i suspect he is continuing to get better um he's gonna be able to he's gonna be able to hang with sasha in a hook i just don't know if he can finish or not the end game's gonna be uh who's gonna who's gonna run out of gas first he's in great shape but i just think sasha is incredibly endurance like uh explosive
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah so that's that's kind of a negative right because no matter how great a shape someone's in if you've got so much fast switch like that normally it falls off a little quicker than the guy that's uh you know but how about if you put him opponent to out of position and and bring him in a very
SPEAKER_03: bad position to not to allow him to survive i don't see anything being bad for sasho sasho is going to stay tight no matter where the match goes after the go i mean i think he's he's compact enough whenever he loses he loses in hook yeah yeah like zole beat him in hook ozan kocak beat him inside like people people it is almost impossible to top roll the top problem yeah yeah he just pushed
SPEAKER_02: Maybe I give him more credit than he deserves as far as his hooking ability, but boy, just looking at his build, I think more or less somebody that I definitely would not want to hook. You wouldn't want to hook him? No, of course not. I would be fighting to the death to try to top roll him.
SPEAKER_03: top maybe yeah maybe unsuccessful but i would still be in between is the best way in between is the best way not deep not totally outside because if you top roll him you will be doing something that you know we haven't seen not not maybe maybe a little bit but you still be the mighty um yeah
SPEAKER_03: Paul needs to come in as strong as, I mean, I think the last time I saw Hutchins pull, Hutchins was able to blast through him. So, yeah, I mean, if Paul's in good shape and ready to go, yeah, it'll be a good one. Yeah, Todd beat him. That wasn't flash, but a few surges, yeah. I have a question for you. What did you think about Rushton versus Sasho match and Paul match? People are saying that Rushton was killing him.
SPEAKER_03: And the reason that Rustem lost is because of the injury. But people also need to consider that first two rounds where Paul attacked and the round three where he attacked were different. Because I remember Paul trying to top roll you. You look at his face and beat him like this.
SPEAKER_02: and following around when you hook you committed next thing i remember you he's almost hurting me he actually pulled a tendon in my the upper part of my forearm and the hook was so so aggressive and violent yeah um
SPEAKER_02: yeah i mean obviously babaya was at his at his limit if he's getting hurt right so you can't take that away from paul i mean just to say that you know russum was killing him and then just all of a sudden out of the blue got hurt well you get hurt normally when you're exceeding what you're capable of doing yeah yeah i agree yeah timmy you said paul's dealing kochak but also zole beat him in hook ajumara just just remember 2019
SPEAKER_01: what what final the the the last match in the final not the the the qualification round and how do you see this match done so uh you know sasha beat rob back then right and guess who uh who who who felt um sasha after the after the match it was neil so new pickup is a secret weapon in my opinion i'm guessing spears theory here that new pickup knows how to pull sasho
SPEAKER_01: and you know who's who's fine with new pauline and pauline always seek people uh uh the elder advice but my opinion pauline has the edge against sascha here because you know he seek other people advice mainly new and he knows how to pull against sascha so in my opinion if if he just commits like he did against um against uh rustam i think you win i think my opinion pauline has a better chance beating sascha than sascha jen beating pauline because sascha hasn't been around
SPEAKER_01: know he's been injured he came back so it's like what six seven months in the last pool so yeah stage stage fight is another one you know and um pauline has too much information on him so i think pauline john do you know this guy or is that on the left i don't know the guy on the right yeah yeah but really do you see models of how he looks yeah yeah yeah he's a monster yeah he's huge i saw that picture earlier today
SPEAKER_02: The guy is getting out of control. Well, he's young yet. He's got room to build. He's got the frame for it. He's like Brock Lesnar. Yeah, no, he's got the frame. He could be a forwarder potter easy. And Erlich, how do you see this match? Um...
SPEAKER_00: I think Paul's just got to commit to the hook. I think if you look at the commentary with Travis and Neil from the last event, they were just begging Paul round three to go in and just commit to the hook. And when he did, I mean, it injured Rustem, which is unfortunate. But I think like John said, that that has to mean that Paul took him to some sort of limit, you know, for that to happen. So I think Paul has to have the belief in himself. And I think he can win that match.
SPEAKER_04: and by the way Paul Lennon yeah
SPEAKER_00: Paul Lennon, the nicest guy on the planet. I mean, I want to divert for one second and just say the one thing that I think is the most attractive about the sport of arm wrestling is this right here. There's these superstars that in my mind are every bit as awesome as a football player, basketball player, and they're all approachable. I send Paul Lennon a message on Facebook. He messages me back.
SPEAKER_03: Ingen messages me, Neil does, I can chat with John. There's no other sport like this in the world. And I think that is a huge thing, a huge selling point to the community. My friend, the thing is that maybe many of the basketball players, when they open their eyes, they found basketball as like mainstream sport, while we, the people that you mentioned,
SPEAKER_03: are the ones that you know coming from the root of the sports and are actually the people who are carrying the sports and their shoulders to this point we have never been unreachable we have we have never been yeah yeah yeah we are we are still like a family you know we are this is at least how i see it and you know you know your followers and john lalatin versus tobias
SPEAKER_03: oh tobias tobias tobias he put he's going to pull the marcio and they marcio i think uh out didn't he be left arm left arm he pulled uh he did the left arm match he he pulled prudnik and topple prudnik maybe you remember he pulled morozov on the first event that you came here when morozov tried to top roll him with left arm
SPEAKER_02: He took Morozov's wrist and pinned him because he's Greek. It'll be interesting to see. I mean, Vitalii's got to be like, he's like, yeah, he's like considered maybe top two, three in the world in some people's minds and maybe rightly so.
SPEAKER_02: But Tobias is got the same frame as is as big as is tall. I mean, does that maybe five inches shorter? Yeah. Oh, he's five inches shorter. Yeah. One is 205. One is 205. The other one is 193. Oh, wow. I thought Tobias was a bigger guy. Is Tobias bigger than Vitalii? No. Vitalii still towers him. Vitalii is 205, two meters and five centimeters. Okay. And
SPEAKER_02: Tobias is 193. Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Yeah, but Tobias, I mean, there's not many people that have that type of height and size. No, no. To me, he's a giant. Yeah, he's a giant. So it'll be interesting to see if that takes away a little bit of Batali's dominance over most people. So out of curiosity, that'll be interesting to see if he has to change up a little bit. But, you know, Batali's got to be, you know, the big favor, right?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, this interesting thing about these two athletes, they have the strongest grip strength in the armwrestling community. They have the strongest squeezing ability. Of course, armwrestling is not about that, but their grip is incredibly strong. Right. And how do you see that done? Before you answer, keep out there. Many thanks to John for bringing so much enjoyment to my life.
SPEAKER_03: the greatest athletes in sports history. Thank you, Tim. This guy, John, this guy, do you know who this guy is? No. This guy, when he was a teenager, like probably 15, he was very strong in arm wrestling. And he loved arm wrestling so much. And one day he was working in a restaurant and his boss told him to come up and try with a guy arm wrestling. He arm wrestled the guy.
SPEAKER_03: He couldn't do much, but the guy told him that he was very good. He has good future. And that guy was Johnny Walker. Oh, really? Yeah. And the sad story after this one, this guy was diving, you know. And one day when he dive, he hit on his head and broke his neck. Oh, shoot. And he is now 62 years old. And he has been paralyzed from here down since that time.
SPEAKER_03: and that makes me emotional to talk about this but this guy living with the love of arm wrestling since then and he says that he can't wait every day to check youtube what's new in arm wrestling that's right right yeah yeah yeah that's cool yeah
SPEAKER_03: i mean it's just like to me a big big inspiration the other day i said devon you are probably the person who loves our messaging the most but then i realized that this guy is the one yeah yeah do you remember john do you remember i shared the other day but do you remember that that our master who inspires you and your answer on the northeast message boards you don't remember right
SPEAKER_03: everybody we wrote it like who inspires you some said john some said cobra some said this and then you said the the people who comes to tournaments and goes home most of the times two uh or two like winning any round up keep showing up even more attitude right yeah and they kept competing and being part of the community you said this on the north's message board it was like a shocking you know because everyone was focused on something else while
SPEAKER_02: you show a different perspective. It has been almost 20 years. I never forget what you just said. Yeah, I do remember that. Yeah. You remember? It's true. I mean, I try to put myself in their shoes, like, why? But then again, I think back to myself, like, those are probably the greatest times is trying to establish a name for yourself and get get that respect and be
SPEAKER_02: know at the bottom rung of the ladder and and be able to look up and say oh i got it it's a long way up but i'm gonna you know that's so yeah yeah it's um it's exciting to be those people yeah but i shouldn't i shouldn't be so inspired like wow like why did you got your butt kicked how come you're back you know but they love it they love it yeah that's something that we probably
SPEAKER_03: and not understand but the only reason they are still part of it is literally 100 love that they feel not that because of trophy if they are not successful nothing you know anyways sg records keep all here god bless you romances and let's go we were talking about the we lost three matches after this one done how do you see uh experience i think in my opinion experience ligaments right of course that has it all
SPEAKER_01: So with all the endurance and all the experience that Vitalii has, I think Vitalii has this one. He's going to come down to top row. Even if Vitalii is out of position, he can still hold him, in my opinion, and he's going to outlast him. So, you know, I mean, Vitalii is fast, very fast too. If Tobias is very strong, fine, you're strong. But after you get him out of position, he can still hold you like he did with Dave Chaffee. And he'll outlast Tobias. So in my opinion, Vitalii wins this.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. And you, Erlich? I'm going to go with Tobias just strictly because he's one of the favorite arm wrestlers for me personally that obviously I found by watching East versus West. So I'm going Tobias.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Yeah. I like to new hopes, new hopes. I would like to see, yeah. Maybe he commits to that hook enough where maybe he's tall enough and can control Vitalii in a hook and then do this little top roll move. And maybe Vitalii will be susceptible to that. Hey, nobody's ever been able to do that to Vitalii. Cause he's so damn tall. Yeah. You playing a guy who has a lever like this, not like this, but you up like this way against him. He top roll you all day long, you know?
SPEAKER_03: Okay, Todd and Oleg Lovechild, thank you for your super chat. In the world of arm wrestling, we are all John's guests. We love him dearly. Thank you. Yeah, yeah. People really love you, John. Really love you. I have a question. Okay. You said earlier that somebody super chatted that John's the greatest athlete of all time, right? All sports. Yeah, for me, yes. Do you guys know who Chael Sonnen is?
SPEAKER_00: UFC fighter? Yeah, yeah. Super articulate guy. I love listening to him. So I banter back and forth with Shale Sonnen. And I told him, I said, Shale, I've got a piece for you. How about the greatest athlete of all combat sports of all time that you may have never heard of? And he said, okay, lay it on me. I said, it's this guy from Illinois named John Brzee. He's an arm wrestler.
SPEAKER_00: He's been dominating the sport for over four decades. And he was very, very intrigued. He's like, send me some more info. I might put together a piece on this. And I said, okay.
SPEAKER_00: So he came back to me a few days later and he says, why is Devon Lorette so damn popular? I said, well, that's a great question. I just want to tease you guys that Shale Sonnen has taken a little bit of interest in John Brzenk. So keep your eyes peeled. There could be something. That's very exciting. So yeah, I'm a big fan of his just because he's so...
SPEAKER_03: he's freaking articulate he's not the one that you know i think he's the best trash talker right oh yeah he's yeah he's amazing with his uh he's got a good mind he's got a good head on his shoulders for sure yeah yeah very well spoken yes very well yeah anyway so let's last three matches dave chappie versus rewas john let's go ah they say that rewa's right now is
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he's not gonna overwhelm Dave. He's not gonna be offensive. He's not gonna, you know, Dave's,
SPEAKER_02: But Dave has been known to run out of gas. Dave, in my mind, is possibly, if not the strongest arm wrestler offensively. Spike pressure. Out of the gate. Yeah, pure. He's going to take anybody and everybody. And I honestly even think if he's hooked up to LeBron properly in the strap set, he could probably even possibly win.
SPEAKER_02: bring Devon out of position I think Dave is that strong the question is can Dave can Dave finish can Revaz somehow hang on and somehow he can he stop him here put a little yeah a little pressure on his hand and wrist Dave's been known to um be like Pushkar you know uh just not have any regard for
SPEAKER_02: Erlich D' establishing a good safe position that he can you know outlast his opponent he's he's red line and his his his hand and forum sometimes pump up to the point where he then ends up getting getting beaten later around so. Erlich D' yeah i'm going to say Dave first round second round easy but just from the from the history boy robots has a chance, maybe switch it around and make it a three two right so we've seen it before but.
SPEAKER_02: So you are saying that Dave is stronger, but you do not know if he can dominate all three rounds or not. Correct, right. And he's been so impressive and aggressive in winning the first two rounds many times now, right? And then just faded enough just to lose a third and then it's all over. He loses the fourth, he loses the fifth. Do you realize that, you know, where Dave brought Hermes with the start and where
SPEAKER_03: Levan brought Hermes is almost the same distance from the pet. The only thing is that Dave's wrist did not handle while Levan. So if we just put Levan's wrist on Dave's arm, it would probably. Yeah. Dave's got a tremendous hand. I mean, his hand and wrists are tremendous, but the problem is it's so much energy and it are so strong that, uh, it, it, it,
SPEAKER_02: it pumps him up. I mean, he's, he's a race car. I mean, he's a dragster. He's one of those super strong, fast Twitch guys. It just doesn't have the, you know, the long endurance muscles that he's got. I don't think he's got any slow Twitch muscles in him. I understand. Yeah. And you're done. So I say they, this is Dave, Dave game to lose. Dave, Dave match to lose in my opinion, because if he doesn't slip,
SPEAKER_01: he might get overwhelmed by Abivas. He needs to slip. He just got to get slipped, get on the strap, and he just knock him out off center and pin him, you know. But if he underestimate him and try to hook him without the strap, he's going to get bent open, man, you know. I don't think he would underestimate anyone. They came to East versus West three times, lost all three matches. He cannot afford anyone. He cannot underestimate anyone, especially someone like Abivas.
SPEAKER_01: but he depends he yeah he he's confident in his hand and wrist and he depends on it and and i think he takes chances that he possibly should maybe shouldn't that's why i say that's one thing i'm worried about right that's number one number two is dave has a long rest mind you all the match he had yeah like maybe what six week rest maybe four weeks west most now he has like well how many months already so he's back and he's energized he's strong
SPEAKER_01: He's a favorite in my opinion. Dave's going to win this. It's his game to lose. He has to slip. Just goddamn the slip, man. Under, over, whatever. Just freaking slip and you win. You know what I'm saying? That's my opinion. Yeah, between the king of the table to Lalit in match two,
SPEAKER_03: as much was yes seven months it was exactly 50 days yeah exactly so he got a lot of time to rest you get day time to rest his muscles ligaments coming back and uh he just gotta get his slip game on that's it man no i i don't think that i think he will just go all for three flat pins you know i don't think he's gonna play around anything and what do you think eric i i mean i agree i think that the time off probably did dave some good uh
SPEAKER_03: i think dave's a pretty heavy favorite i think 60 40. i think dave should win the first three rounds pretty easily first three rounds is the whole match you know that's it yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway so let's go now the things are getting a little bit heated up inactive versus on that wave john well i mentioned earlier what i feel about that i think iraqli is more explosive
SPEAKER_03: john can i cut you quickly yesterday i had directly on garber as my guest and i asked directly like you kind of made a mistake and depended on your horsepower so much and forget about controlling against john did you learn it he said yeah he took lessons and he is more focused on positioning and you know controlling
SPEAKER_03: than just just going like crazy to do uh you know this this what he said so maybe after hearing this you may have
SPEAKER_02: yeah no i mean i i hope that i hope that lesson doesn't backfire on him with uh anger vibe because i feel like what he did to me is something that he needs to do with hunger vibe he needs to be very aggressive um i think i think uh hunger by it definitely has the advantage with the endurance so directly needs to be so aggressive established um
SPEAKER_02: James Forrest, Norcal PTACC, he'll be confident enough to do a little bit of establish a good cup when I established that cup with anger by of the top role was came pretty easy, but you have to be very aggressive with it. James Forrest, Norcal PTACC, If directly doesn't doesn't hit off the go, I mean and anger by have can stop at any way and manipulate it at any.
SPEAKER_02: any time at any point hit where goodbye i don't think it matters anywhere anywhere i think even i think if ungarbaev can somewhat stop the way i stopped directly even in a bad position it's it's it's going to tilt heavily towards under by iraq is going to need to finish the matches uh quickly like he you know like he beat marcio he cannot top roll he cannot top roll on that way
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, no, he can top roll him, but establishing the cup more than just hitting hard outside. If he just hits hard outside with a flat wrist, then I think Angrabaya will take control of that, will be able to manipulate that. So he needs to cup a little bit to get Angrabaya's hand to be, like I mentioned with doing with Devon. I mean, the palm needs to be turned up a little bit.
SPEAKER_02: But yeah, I think a Reckley, I don't know. I don't know if a Reckley, I didn't really test either one of them in a hook. Reckley's got chances. It's a great match. It's going to be super close. You know, even if a Reckley wins the first two, I still wouldn't count on a Ongarbaev out. I'm going to still say, oh shit, still not over. It's still on Ongarbaev's to win.
SPEAKER_03: you are you planning to watch the event well of course you know i will of course and and okay you are you are a better i know that you like to bet i'm not asking you to bet against me i'm just saying if you had money where would it go i'd have to lean just just slightly
SPEAKER_02: to under by a criticality, I think is going to somehow figure it out. Well, when, when. Oh, I don't know. I don't know if, I don't know if criticality will wear out like I did. He didn't with Michael. So I'm, I suspect that he'll be better equipped to, to withstand that risk press.
SPEAKER_02: than I was able to. So, yeah, I don't think, I don't think directly we'll be successful doing that against Kurtigalli. So he better, he better go outside. Hit hard, hit hard, hit fast. You know, obviously I think it's going to go under the straps, but it's going to require a little bit more commitment of establishing that cup instead of just hitting completely, you know, high knuckle straight back. It's going to be a good one. It's going to be a good one.
SPEAKER_02: I think Erekle is the favorite as far as blasting off the go. I think he was more powerful initially.
SPEAKER_02: know comparing but it depends on what kind of position he will put it together after yeah he just needs to be able to finish him quickly even if he's not able to finish him quickly then i'm going to say oh shoot uh uh is going to be better equipped to win the second match the third match i mean he's iraqi not only has has to win quick you know it has to win quickly and cleanly uh first match second match certainly if it stops at any point even you know
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but John, what if it actually puts Hidalgo in a bad position? In such position, Ongarbaev, if he fights, I think he will be the one who is exhausted. It's like when we say like, this guy has better endurance, yes, but it depends on...
SPEAKER_02: round one what position this guy is you know of course before yet of course but i even even in that scenario i still think under by him is going to be able to outlast you know if it goes if it goes a long distance match it'll be it'll be younger vibes to win then do you realize that when you beat on gotta be around one after you get your position he was not able to resist
SPEAKER_03: no yeah no yeah yeah and normally on that way you can resist in every position but i think that he couldn't you took him and then he wanted to hook you when he tried to hook you he totally gave his tornado to you and you hop him fully and it was just yeah and and you're done
SPEAKER_01: um you asking the guy who put them both i go with john opinion all day long i mean there's nobody else there's nobody else that could predict this match better john pulled both of them he knows their weakness and their strength so if they smart they listen to this podcast or they call john personally for advice
SPEAKER_01: i go whatever john say in my opinion because yeah i i think john knows exactly how to pull these two and they know how to win each other so they just swallow their pride and call john up for advice and just stick to that to that advice man that's it i would listen to john i wouldn't have any advice for either one of them i just i just i i i i would listen to john but i would never rent my mind to anyone i would i would listen here take it and mix it with what i know i would never totally give
SPEAKER_00: Because it's important on what I am capable of as well. John knows Irakli, but he doesn't know Irakli better than Irakli knows himself, you know. Yeah. Yeah. And Erlich, you? Super close match. Both very impressive. I think Kittergali probably has just the slightest of edges, you know. He just always seems so cool and calm and collected at all points. And I just think he'll get the win. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And John, before we go to the last match, were you very impressed the way that Ongarbaev pulled against Michael? I was like, I was amazed the way how he was patient, where he attacked, where he stopped, how he countered. Because you're pulling against Michael Todd. Michael Todd, I don't know why people just folks like negative about this guy is one of the hardest guy to pull against, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, he may have lost against this guy or that guy, but not many people can play a chess game with him. And Ongar Baer is a lightweight guy who never pulls against someone like Michael to counter everything
SPEAKER_02: where to wait where to attack how to move the the versatility how did they very impressed about his super impressed yeah you knew my opinion of that match going in i thought michael for sure michael was gonna be just what you are for sure i thought michael was gonna win i had no doubt that mike was gonna in fact i lost a hundred dollars betting against devon that michael uh on that match so wow yeah i know it's uh
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that really surprised me. Very impressive. And you feel actually really good that I didn't get beat by somebody that Michael would smash. I think his table IQ is up there. And he's got obviously a lot of time on the table. He can pull for probably hours. I mean, his endurance didn't seem to fade at all. Yesterday, somebody asked me to super chat. They said, answer honestly.
SPEAKER_03: you also were out of gas, right? He said that against Michael. And he said, no, he could pull. He was good. Yeah, he was good. He said he could pull more and more. That's another scary thing about him. And he said he wants to pull Devon. And I said, which category? He said 115. I want to get big 115. And he says he believes in his endurance. He just needs some time. And he says that it would be an incredible match.
SPEAKER_03: And I think that I'm not sure that if he can beat Devon or not, but I am 100% sure he will give much better match than Evgeny gave to. Because Evgeny likes to have full control and armors. So once he's out of position, he didn't seem so effective. But I have seen Ongar Bey pulling against Alex Kurdesha like this. We saw how he pulled against Michael. So this guy, I think that as a chess game,
SPEAKER_00: he will be the best opponent maybe for that one. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Absolutely. In the Michael Todd versus Ungar Bayev match, I think it was round one, Michael won, right? And I think it was round two was one of the best rounds of arm wrestling I've ever seen. It was so back and forth between those two. I believe it was round two, if I'm not mistaken. I mean, go back and watch that. That was just a brilliant round. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: yeah counter moves yeah it was unbelievable yes yes like i i was like this like this like a chess game like yeah you can't you can't see anything better michael was just switching up to you know shoulder pressure and he was rising up to not to allow that he was waiting here in a position that he has the left it's the same position when you beat michael he came here
SPEAKER_02: remember you arrested and typically Michael has tremendous endurance I'm very I mean he's in the tip top shape but for so for criticality to outlast him like he did and I'll maneuver him very super impressive yeah and interesting thing is that Michael is pulling all kind of people but people are
SPEAKER_03: pulling only Michael to experience such thing. There are not many. So Michael is experienced about pulling against anything, against hook puller, side pressure, top roller, everything. So he is just 100% experienced. But the other guy, when you never pull someone like Michael, you don't really know what to do. Michael looks like he's getting all his range of motion back. Yeah. The last match, John.
SPEAKER_03: one versus canada no i mean uh let me start with the question just go 2021 december round one the match started you brought devon here and that one was like this this much from the pet and even devon thought that there was a moment that if john would switch the shoulder pressure and he could beat me imagine ready go if somehow
SPEAKER_02: gennady brings him there and you know how gennady can you know you know yes he's got an impossibility oh absolutely if if the 2021 version of devon that i pulled shows up to pull ganadi no no no no but what i know stronger they will come but trust me
SPEAKER_02: stronger gannady will come so i i'm assuming that gannady also stronger than 2021 december chamberlain yeah well yeah i i i i don't see that i can't i haven't seen that with with gannady's matches he's he's struggled and he's he's had a hard time um yes he beat dave you squeaked by dave um he you know failed against jerry i i don't i
SPEAKER_03: Devon is on another level right now. Devon, in my mind, from what I felt just months ago, is not the same Devon that I pulled in 2021. Is there any possibility it may not be the same? It's a possibility, I guess. Because it's all about the preparation or starting opening. If you are pulling Devon this year,
SPEAKER_02: like lifetime shots you know so so the problem with devin or you know going up against devin i mean ganade can be stronger bigger wider shoulders biceps triceps but it's still so hard to make your
SPEAKER_02: frame grow. He's not going to see still going to have the same. I know Devon's been teasing about his hand size, the same same build the same hand form is going to be still just limit very limited. Yes, all those big muscles can can get bigger and stronger. But
SPEAKER_02: I think the key to beating Devon is having a super strong cup, a super strong hand. And do you think that when he is like this, there is no possibly to, to, you know, I don't see, no, I don't see that happening. I don't see that happening. So Devon. So Devon, you are saying that Devon is going to dominate him 3-0? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. He's going to, he'll be able to, he'll be able to put enough pressure on Genadi's hand that after the first round, it'll be done. It'll be, he'll be shut down.
SPEAKER_02: if Genadi somehow can establish strong enough hook to get, you know, be able to use his power, then, then yes, I mean, Genadi could win a match or two, but even then that's going to take enough out of him that it's going to be hard to complete, you know, to go through six rounds. Do you think that Devon is going to put Genadi to that helpless position that he put Prudnik later rounds?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think Devon, once Devon knows that his opponent is blown up, that he can do anything and everything, you know. But do you think that Genadi will be in such pace? Yeah, I think Genadi's build is somewhat like Dave. He's a race car. He's going to wear out really quick. He's going to expend a lot of energy. Genadi is one of the best emberers guy in the world. Is he? Okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I just go by what I see and the type of type of build that he is that I just don't see him he's not the you know the lanky guys that would be able to complete a mile anytime soon, but. yeah. And you want.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah, you know, I'm saying this is a battle of bone versus muscle, right? Devon got strong bones, and he's going to use his bone and his frame against muscle like Genadi. Genadi can do whatever he wants. He lost in a hook against, what is it, Jerry. He tried to hook Jerry, I think, round three, and Jerry just blew through him. If Devon commits his frame, how is Genadi going to win? You're thinking that Devon is going to go inside with you?
SPEAKER_03: he will go inside with him yeah i think he's wrong no not round one but i'm saying like you know maybe around two it's a different thing you know you are telling me that they'll be talking about fresh guys meeting you know you're telling us after again are they exhausted and then put in the shoulder you know this i'm talking about how the fresh match is gonna after you exhaust the guy you can't even lift him from the pad you know it's different thing
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you're right, you're right. But yeah, you got a good point there, yeah. Yeah, Devon will not go in the hook early game, no. He's gonna, he's gonna do the, he's gonna, he's gonna go up in the up row again, you know? But once Devon get in the hook, I mean, power, bone, his bone gets muscle, right? Devon's using his bone, his tendon, his ligament against Genadi's muscle, which one gets higher more, you know? So, in my opinion, Devon wins. Like John said, Devon wins all day, in my opinion. He got bigger goals.
SPEAKER_01: You know, he's probably going to do Dave Chaffee and then Hermes and then LeVon. Just kidding. All right. Devon't forget to blink off. He's going to go against Dennis Denison. Yeah, Dennis. So, yeah, Dennis in October. Yeah. I'm saying in between, it could be Dave Chaffee and then Dennis, you know. And you, Erlich?
SPEAKER_00: I lean towards Devon. I'm just happy you got him on East versus West and brought him out of these year-long gaps in polling. I think Devon polling often is great for the world. I think Devon probably wins...
SPEAKER_00: not easily first round, but I think he drains Genadi enough that he can humiliate him in the next two rounds. Unfortunately, that's just the way Devon is. He'll go make you quit. Um, you know, he he's, he's a soldier and, and he goes to war every time. Um, he's very unique in his mindset. I think compared to most people, he really does seem like he's willing to truly die every match, which I think is, is pretty crazy.
SPEAKER_03: um so i'll go with devin yeah i think he's he's probably the heavy favorite in my opinion yeah when you talk about the humiliating him or something i really need to have a talk with those guys before they win that this is all only arm wrestling because
SPEAKER_03: those guys are getting a little bit aggressive, you know, I need, I need, we don't, we don't want to start out, you know, war between Canada and Georgii. I hope not. I hope not. That one will be there. That one will be there. We don't want sky team. We want, we want, I will make sure that this is only arm wrestling. That's only for, because I always hype their matches. But then after the point, I realized it like not from the,
SPEAKER_03: that one side but from the other side things may be taken more seriously cultural differences so i will need to sit down with them and i say listen you know this is not canada this is not georgia you are in turkey so please you know just arm wrestle shake hands you know be as aggressive as you can be at the table without any other thing than arm wrestling you know and john the last thing last two things i will ask you jerry catherine hermes july 29th
SPEAKER_02: Istanbul East versus West Age. Ermes is your boy, I know that. Yeah, I can't go against Ermes. I think he's number two in the world. I think Jerry is going to be very surprised at what kind of arm strength Ermes possesses. But Ermes could over top roll him. And if Jerry gets jammed in there,
SPEAKER_03: I could see it being a little bit of a struggle for Hermes, but I think Hermes is actually strong enough to make that commitment to shoulder roll into Jerry's. John, I have a question. When I said that you said if Genadi tries to go outside, you said you will see that Jerry is going to beat him. And you were right about it. And the question is, do you think that Hermes can beat Jerry with fully outside move or he needs to do as you guys doing the spinated
SPEAKER_02: side pressure type of thing or you think that in any way he can beat him yeah no i think i think i see it happening two ways ermys is just just smart enough and strong enough not to completely run away from jerry and and just hit him side pressure to take jerry away from his shoulder roll but i also think ermys can also rock back into a defensive position and top roll jerry completely where jerry gets jammed in there and also then be able to be
SPEAKER_03: climb up patient enough and then well not he's not going to beat him outside if he tries to continue to beat him outside yeah but he can commit his shoulder i've seen well we've seen him against the show you are saying that even the match goes to here there is still chance for airmen to recover from that position to be able to turn it turn it you know with the shoulder roll at the end i understand i understand there is a supermarket roman says gennady pull level non-stop hook
SPEAKER_03: for 60 seconds. I don't remember Devon pulling that long, he says. Also, Silky Wilkie, my friend, yesterday I missed your super chat. I didn't see it. It was just you send it right before I close the podcast. So sorry about it, my friend. Very sorry. And John, the last one is Levan versus Morozov.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that Morozov, I talked with Morozov, you know, Morozov beat Revaz. You remember East versus West five, but the guy was pulling every two and a half months from February till December. You understand? Non-stop. The guy was exhausted. Also Revaz probably, but he has been training since that time. He's totally healthy. He's young.
SPEAKER_03: and he's he said that he will be minimum 140 145 kilos he is planning to be 320 pounds he told me that even now he is 25 percent stronger with the ways and everything that he's lifting than the time that he be drive us and he still have three four months you saw his pictures recently he's the guy is just kidding is there any possibility this guy to travel
SPEAKER_02: I think the world of arm wrestling and maybe even LeBron hopes that's the case. I mean, I think everybody hopes that he's, yeah, that someone can give LeBron a match. I mean, including LeBron, I think, yeah, hopefully that he's able to. Hopefully he's big enough and strong enough. And, you know, he definitely has a frame if his hands is strong. In fact, his frame is probably bigger than LeBron's, right? So.
SPEAKER_02: yeah I mean for sure we all hope it right yeah yeah I mean yeah not that I'm against LaVon I don't I love I love LaVon LaVon was yeah yeah he's a great guy but um it's it's it's just so you know it's disappointing that he's yeah he needs the competition I mean sure he's probably wanting the competition so yeah yeah lonely up there
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I know. You've been there in the past, you've been lonely up there, so you know how he felt, he's feeling right now. Some people tells me like, you know, when they set the Adam versus Devon match, oh, why did you set this match? You know, he's going to kill you and give him another two years or like the same thing they are now repeating.
SPEAKER_03: And from same time, they are saying why that one doesn't pull more often. But for sure, Morozov is one of those guys that deserves a shot, right? Of course. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so this is the last question I wanted to ask. Erlich, thank you very much, my friend, for joining. You guys want to say something lastly? Yeah, you go first. You go first. Oh, yeah. I mean, just thank you, Ingen. Thank you, John. Really appreciate the opportunity, obviously.

SPEAKER_01: to start building their brand, make the money. That's how you grow. No, it's important. It's important for the sport as a whole, for sure. I mean, yeah. And that's how I know Ingen about this, the VIP thing. You know, I want to support the event. I want to support the athletes. And that's how I got through it, because you guys advocate yourself and promote yourself. So, you know, Ingen's got a lot more energy than the rest of us. So he's...
SPEAKER_03: It depends, it depends. Whenever I hear motivating things,
SPEAKER_02: and then then i'm like okay yeah so listen people think that john i'm doing this like all for business or something but you know my passion from like all from decades ago right john i need a comment i i even noticed that your your your camera must be better or something your backdrop's better the image is but you figured out hd now what do you got going on everybody's way better it almost looks professional like a professional studio you're in me
SPEAKER_03: Well, from my perspective, I guess you're sure it matches your couch and looks good. You don't have the red curtains behind you. Last five years, the same couch and this is my phone with worship cameras. I use my wife's phone. Better camera. By the way, East versus West stage misses you and hope to see you here again.
SPEAKER_02: do you enjoy east versus west john oh absolutely i mean it's yeah yeah it's tremendous i i wish i know you mentioned something that i don't know if you're going to do one in july um i i would
SPEAKER_02: love to be a part of it again uh but maybe we'll have to wait until october if i set your match i need to set todd hutchings as well so that he will be equal yeah yeah you both are having a match this match be way tougher than my match my needs to be like i've lost my last three matches i can't be losing four i think it's the last three you didn't lose the last two matches
SPEAKER_03: I got beat by Dennis. I got beat by Ankur Bhai indirectly. Oh, but I did win Petrenko in there. Petrenko, yeah. But listen, I will tell you something. If you didn't have those breathing problems and things, I cannot say anything about Dennis Mash. Dennis Mash is not even same category. This guy is a heavyweight category while you are like, he is super heavyweight while you are like,
SPEAKER_03: light weight so it is a legacy match what do you think my chances are against the bovoda i got no chance i shouldn't even i think that you have very good chance but you need to go outside if you go to you did the same thing when you tried to hook him in 2004 you know you you went like this yeah i i think that your pronators as of now they're pulling at that time john you were just full like risk risk commitment you know
SPEAKER_03: and you didn't really pull you developed it later on like this and then beating him if you keep his wrist neutralized like this and then that you will have incredible match but not sure how strong his wrist is we will see i just hope i just hope i can surprise him a little bit but ah don't come there too little bit just come there for a full surprise you know i say you kill him that's good kill him
SPEAKER_03: pulling john not picking john man remember that have that mentality john next time somebody think about your name they gotta take it serious you know what i'm saying yeah yeah thank you guys thank you guys john it's a long time thank you very much for your patient and time thank you don thank you eric and thank you everyone
