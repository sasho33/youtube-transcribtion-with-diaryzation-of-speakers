SPEAKER_03: Perry Kivolowitz, So I pressed live just want to check it out. Perry Kivolowitz, Oh. Perry Kivolowitz, thing.
SPEAKER_04: all right paul it seems like we are live are we live seems like it um all right cool the only thing is i did not somehow for some reason did not change the thumbnail but it's all good uh let me just go to the chat
SPEAKER_04: All right, so what's happening, Paul? Not much, man. All right, here we are today. We're still in East vs. West channel once again, but this time, once again with a good purpose. So we have a lot of questions coming in about the qualifiers, and here we have Paul and me, mostly Paul, to answer to the most common ones and see what's going on.
SPEAKER_01: All right. First, let's talk about the ones we got coming up. So we are going to have a total of eight Northeast or not Northeast. What am I saying? North American qualifier. That's two in Canada and six in the United States. So we've put most of those out there on Facebook events. Not all of them, to my knowledge.
SPEAKER_01: But we do have dates and venues set for seven out of the eight. The eighth one is going to be in Manitoba, Canada, run by Billy.
SPEAKER_01: Billy Berg, I believe, in conjunction with Ryan Espy because he's from that area. So that's the latest breaking one. I do not believe we have room for any more. The closest one we have coming up is in Florida, Ertem, if you want to talk about that one. That's this Saturday. And then we'll get into the details of how the qualification works and advancement to the finals and what that entails.
SPEAKER_04: Right, so we do have a Florida armwrestling qualifier coming up this Saturday, so literally in two days. It's in Brooksville, Florida in Sarah Backman's, well, I'm sorry, Sarah Levis and her husband Jim.
SPEAKER_04: uh gonna be gonna be super gonna be super atmosphere we're gonna have a lot of people there we're gonna have food we're gonna have pullers we're gonna it's gonna be a big thing it's gonna be at the same time as a start as our uh florida army singapore thing in the same time so we're gonna have bunch of people wearing the jerseys and everything gonna be looking really really official so we
SPEAKER_04: i'll be excited for the fal start uh for like an official one and for the qualifier as well because people are coming excited for the qualifier so i just saw chance uh got his medals in for those fal ones they're nice big heavy yeah like five inch medals
SPEAKER_04: very nice yeah whoever is coming for just a qualifier will be in for a treat for a nice tournament right and if somebody is just coming just to get just to be part of the tournament they also gonna be surprised right or not surprised but maybe if they wanted to know like what was
SPEAKER_04: Brandon working on and like what were we trying to come up as a just a tournament in general they'll be excited because there was a lot of work put in we have Robert Kelly driving all the way from Oklahoma to do a stream so we're gonna have a lot of cool stuff going on and of course you know all of that being a part of uh East versus qualifier so that's your chance to that's your
SPEAKER_01: what we like if we're like the first chance to call no there was already a qualifier right somewhere there was also there was one already in south america run by gabby vascancellos right but not in the united states yet so i haven't seen the results to that one yet but she said it went well
SPEAKER_04: got you so probably the first one on the fastest one for everyone basically to qualify uh you know right this second and then and then move on to the next one but yeah so if you if you're in the area or in i just got a message are you competing saturday yes i am competing saturday i didn't know i have to keep it left-handed but i should have asked my questions earlier
SPEAKER_04: and if someone has some questions that we know but i am competing left uh both-handed at the tournament this saturday we can we can we can cover that right now before we get into the next dates just because it's a topic that just popped up right because i'm a stupid person
SPEAKER_04: i thought uh because well originally i thought on the right hand it paid right on the right hand that matters for us so i thought i could qualify right-handed at the pre-qualifiers and they'll pull both hands at the finals but that's not how it works everybody yes you must qualify left so it's top two pro classes there's four classes for men and there's two classes for women both arms qualify
SPEAKER_01: Both arms are paid out at the finals, 1,000 in the class who were right and left, that's 500, 300, 200, the first, second, and third respectively, either arm. The only caveat there is only right arm at those weight classes is guaranteed a spot at East versus West on a main card event, all expenses paid plus a payout and a win bonus, all that good stuff and a good treatment. Left arm will be watched.
SPEAKER_01: similar to how it was done in wal um with the wal qualification events that were held around the country they were looked at for preliminary matches main card matches but there was no guarantee um so engen will be watching the finals both right and left so there's a little bit of carrot unfortunately a majority of his matches based on the amount that he can put on the card are going to be right arm
SPEAKER_01: but he still does put several left arm matches on those cards, and it will be a talent search of sorts. So if you are a left-handed puller, I still encourage you to come out because it's going to be great no matter what. Plus, you got payouts for the finals. Yeah, the payouts are a great thing. Sorry to interrupt you, Ann. One thing that not that many people maybe realize right now is
SPEAKER_04: but like a high level performance back at those qualifiers for wl it kind of changed a lot of people's career after the fact because they were sick that more and like they did good at that time so that's the shape they remembered and so that's a good uh time even if you maybe don't if you're not that top two guy
SPEAKER_04: and you qualify at the final qualifier, that top 10 people, that's going to make it to the, uh, to the certain top or they gonna, you know, they're going to be looked at a little differently from that point on. Right. And you got to keep in mind too, from perspective of the tournament,
SPEAKER_01: A lot of the tournament draw is going to have something to do with how the outcome is. If Angan and the powers that be are watching and there's four early on in the first round, and it potentially eliminates maybe one or two guys, that's something that has to be watched and scrutinized. It's like anything in any tournament.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the top guy is going to wind up going, but there's a lot of things that lead up to being the top guy, and sometimes it's not always being the best guy. So it'll be watched. It'll be screened. It'll be scrutinized. So it makes sense to go ahead and get your, if you think you have any chance at all of knocking some people off or getting a good bracket and making it to the finals, by all means, bring yourself out. So we got some more to go over. The next one I think up, I don't think I have them all in order.
SPEAKER_01: but it's going to be the TAL one in Texas. That one's going to be April 18th in League City, Texas. If you have any questions about that, the director there is going to be Billy Ortegas. Reach out to him. Actually, Texas qualifier is February 18th. Yeah, that's what I said. What did I say? You said April 15th. Yes, February 18th.
SPEAKER_04: apologies february 18th thank you for the correction yeah april 15 is the um new york yeah
SPEAKER_04: so what do we have so everybody who is wondering where they are the links are actually all under the description of this live video for the four that we're talking about which we have north uh west with tim talmage i'm assuming that in washington we have that's the next one the date there is march 4th if you have a question about that reach out to tim talmage
SPEAKER_04: What's the next one in order, Ertem? Do you have it? I think there's a March 18th one. So it's February 18th for Texas, then it's March 4th for Washington, then it's, I guess it's you guys in April 15th.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we have one that I don't have a Facebook event for. That's going to be at the Grinder Gym. That's going to be March 18th in San Diego, California. I believe Derek Smith is going to be your POC for that one. You got any questions, hit him up on socials. You guys can leave any questions or comments, questions or anything like that in the comments. But if you want direct communication or link sharing, you're probably going to have to reach out on Instagram or Facebook to get the links.
SPEAKER_01: So then, yeah, we got, then we have the next one, I think up is April 15th. And that is going to be ours. The American arm wrestler one in the Northeast that was going to be in Utica, New York. It's going to be at Steve Hale's hot rod restoration shop, which is a really cool venue. Uh, this guy was on, um,
SPEAKER_01: was on the National Geographic channel for his restorations. And the place is a really, really super dope venue. That's where we did the underground series when COVID was going on. Awesome venue. We're expecting a big turnout. We do have a Facebook link for that one if you're interested. And I did go out of order because the final one is going to be the Cobra Classic, Cobra Rose, April 1st. In Indiana? Yeah, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
SPEAKER_01: Erlich D' Cobra roads is going to be your poc there if you got any questions reach out and on the socials if you need any details. Erlich D' And the final one in Canada that we have a flyer for is going to be held by the table monkeys Michael constantini and I think Alex carry. Erlich D' That is going to be on the. Erlich D' thing April 8.
SPEAKER_01: Joseph DiCarlo, M.D.: April 8 it's going to be on April 8 and, if you have any questions we can reach out to Michael concertini or Alex carry and the final one is is Billy bird. Joseph DiCarlo, M.D.: Who is going to have a manitoba one we don't have a flyer for that one yet and don't have a Facebook event that was the last added one that's two for Canada six to the United States one for South America. Joseph DiCarlo, M.D.: So the totals if you don't a math we got to per class.
SPEAKER_01: That brings us, there's nine, so there will be 18 people in your class if you make it to the finals. And that's also, you know, as long as everybody can make it to the finals. The finals are going to be in Virginia. I do not have all the final details for that because we are still waiting on a flyer. But it is going to be, I believe. June 5th.
SPEAKER_01: T. John McCune, M.D.: June 5 yes, and that will be hosted by Travis agent James read i'll be helping out with that it's going to be at a large local brewery. T. John McCune, M.D.: In the Virginia area so awesome venue we've been there before for some of travis's other things so that's where the finals will be as far as details go again.
SPEAKER_01: Right and left pays out $1,000. So each one of these qualifiers, right off the top, every promoter in each one of these qualifiers is going to take the first $2,000 and is going to go to the finals to pay for awards and the payouts. So there will be $1,000 per class paid out both right and left for classes, men's, two classes, women's, weight classes, 170 for men's, 200,
SPEAKER_04: What's the other one, Ertem? Is it 230 and then supers? I don't know because I'm so sold on the 200 class being easy. So that's why I didn't even know. I know there's a difference, right? Because ours is like, I think 160, 180, 200, 220 or whatever, which some people have to adjust, but the 200 have to stay. So I'm like, I'm okay. I'm very selfish.
SPEAKER_01: Right. So those classes 170, 170, 200, 230, and supers, it puts you in the middle of the Angans weight classes. So it allows for like an intermediate area in between those 75, 85, 95, 105, 115 kilos. Right. It puts you right in the middle. But it allows for a reasonable amount that he can guarantee everyone a match.
SPEAKER_01: So some of these preexisting events had different weight classes. It will be up to the promoter, how they handle that. So if they have weight classes that split in between it is on them to decide how they're going to run that class. So if this one class qualifies and this one doesn't, that's up to the promoter for us in the Northeast, we chose to just use those weight classes. Right. Keep it as it is. So it's going to these, I think every one of these events is also going to offer other classes.
SPEAKER_01: So don't think this is only for pros. If you're an amateur and you want to multi-class, by all means, there'll be amateur classes. Yeah, you just want to come and arm wrestle, yes. Yes, come, everybody, because it's going to be a great venue. It's going to be great venues, great turnouts. This, like the WAL qualifications, is going to rustle up the best pullers in the country.
SPEAKER_01: So each one of these events are going to be as close as we get to a regional-type finals with the best arm wrestlers coming out. So if you're an amateur and you want to be involved in a cool tournament, like, this is where you want to be. Question, how does it work for amateurs to start a qualification and go to the finals?
SPEAKER_01: there are no qual like amateurs can amateurs do not have to qualify to go to the finals you you don't have to qualify to be there you ideally you know listen if you if you want to you know if you're tracking everything that's going on in east versus west you're going to want to be at these qualifiers to see these see the production and see the pros pull and see your local guy make it to the finals if you want to come to the finals the finals is going to be
SPEAKER_04: uh probably bigger than the nationals that i took part in uh when i say bigger i don't necessarily mean in volume i mean in quality when you take oh yeah well here's the thing not that many people realize too like uh that's gonna be pretty insane even during wl qualifiers there were like two to three qualifiers per state and then you got like just tied finals now you're really gonna have one
SPEAKER_04: know six you know whatever like you only have like 12 to 16 people in this final spirit class if everybody shows and they all like this your top two guys and not your top two guys per state your top two guys peer region that showed up that's a lot of killers in that tournament so that's going to be very like it's going to be a hot thing uh if you're following north american arm wrestling or if you're in north america
SPEAKER_01: Right. I mean, and like, like I said, I wouldn't, I wouldn't miss those finals world. I guaranteed I, I gotta be there. You know what I mean? Cause that's going to be, it's going to be the closest thing that we saw that we see since like WAL finals out in Vegas. It will be a class stack just like that.
SPEAKER_04: uh derek smith an update as of yesterday the california qualifier date and location are to be updated again the person holding the tournament i was piggybacking onto decided he did not want his event to be a qualifier okay i'll say it really had been announced and committed to okay derek let us know as soon as possible obviously we got the group chat going
SPEAKER_01: we got to do is update that flyer i think billy can do that and then we can get that out there um derrick hopefully you're making a facebook event so we can share um i think as far as promoters go we're gonna do our best to share each other's events as they come up and get them out there nationwide um hey uh let's i know we're gonna hype up all these qualifiers but let's let's make sure we kind of stand on other questions right what other things people be asking
SPEAKER_01: Right. So big, big questions are largely coming around those weight class, things like that. You know, there was questions about left arm. So I think we cleared that up. Left arm goes to finals, has payouts. So you have to qualify to pool in the finalist left arm. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. So top two, same deal. The other thing is, how are the math? What does winning the finals entail?
SPEAKER_01: The winning the finals entails getting a main card match, which will probably be, I would assume, East versus West 9 or 10 or maybe 11, depending on how he spaces it out. So first question is, well, who am I going to pull? How's he going to pair me up? Well, this is going on in the East as well. I don't have a list of all the countries that Angan has lined up, but there are a bunch and it's stacking up. I think he's close to the same number.
SPEAKER_01: And I think his idea is to have the same amount of qualifiers
SPEAKER_04: and just marry those up how they make most sense so yeah plus well there may be maybe there's a guy who you know there are people like i believe chan's gonna compete too there are some people that like somewhat in the system or maybe they've been looked at so maybe it's just your opportunity to show your spot and you may be there sooner or maybe later but yeah as you said there's a lot of as you said it's pretty much talent searching and if you happen to be this
SPEAKER_04: somewhat random number one number two guy yeah and it's hard to match your Apple number one guy number one I'm sorry you don't get to qualify but uh yeah yeah the the they'll they'll find you a spot right well let's be see yeah yeah you're you'll marry up with the winner of one of the winners on these so like if we have an even number that you're gonna face one of those guys
SPEAKER_01: so like if you know you win and you're like all right let's look at these let's see you know and of course there'll be discussions about who matches up with who what's going to be the best match how do we figure it out you know what i mean the angle will have a lot of thinking to do and then i'm sure he's going to have to separate you know between a couple different cards to get you guys on there but what it entails
SPEAKER_01: is all expenses paid you get your flight paid your hotel paid two meals a day basically and they treat you like a professional athlete you get paid to show um usually a win bonus depending on how things go um but yeah it's it's you know it's pretty much the best experience that i've had in arm wrestling thus far and i've been blessed enough to be involved in wal different experience with wal um
SPEAKER_01: This, not to take anything away from that, because I would love to go back to WAL as well, but going to Istanbul and competing against Europeans has been more of a highlight to my career. And the way we're treated over there in a country that I think respects arm wrestling a little bit more is different as American. You know, you know how we get looked at when we say we arm wrestle.
SPEAKER_01: Over there you get looked at, they know what you're talking about, you know. So it's a different feel. And you get to be in a room amongst some of the best guys in the world who've ever done it. So what's even cooler to me is I know how it is in the Northeast. Up here, we got some guys that don't go out much and don't do much. And like you talk about Jeremy Paffey down there in Florida.
SPEAKER_01: We got dudes like that that could win this damn thing. Right, right, right. Who don't normally travel, who could show up here and then drive to Virginia and be on their way to Istanbul. And it's easy to say, how do you get noticed in arm wrestling? Well, there's a million ways. A lot of us doing YouTube and social media, things work out because we're more active. Some guys don't want to do that. They might work a construction job 12 hours a day, but be really freaking strong, but not that interested.
SPEAKER_04: This is the opportunity for those guys. And I would love nothing more than to see like half of these finalists be guys we don't know. How awesome would that be? Right. That's going to be pretty crazy. And as you said, like, I mean, not anymore, I think, depending on who shows up. I mean, but on a bad day or the good day, perhaps we'll fuck up and win this class, right? Still, it is funny.
SPEAKER_04: right so not not yeah not defined this one but yeah yeah there's guys that can come and ruin someone's day at this pre-qualifiers right so i mean i'm trying to think what other detailed questions i've got i got questions on rules
SPEAKER_01: We will be using the same rules that are used in East versus West. Normally we do our, you know, you know, WAL style set up running fouls. We will use East versus West fouls and foul system rule system. I know every event is probably going to do that differently. But if you're prepping for the finals, we need to be prepared for that uniformity.
SPEAKER_01: i'm going to ask the chat if there's a question questions away anything that i'm not covering or we're not thinking about get it out here now this is the opportunity to get the details out questions
SPEAKER_03: all right so i have the chat of the any questions and stuff and um oh so to make sure oh paul what's up with the picture disappeared hold on i got it
SPEAKER_04: where can I watch it? You can watch it. You can watch the qualifiers as they go. Technically, I believe our qualifier will be live streamed with on Roberts Kelly's system. And as far as the channel choice, I don't know, it could be mine, it could be chances like we have a couple that we can go off on. And yeah,
SPEAKER_01: We're toying with that too. We haven't like finalized how we're going to do it. We're going to work with Steve out and hopefully we have the software where you can share it on multiple YouTubes. Ideally, we'll just push it out wherever. It's not about like having one YouTube channel on it everywhere. Let as many people see it as possible. Yeah. There's a question for you. I believe, do you know if storm or Sam will be, will participate in the qualifiers? I do not. And I, you know,
SPEAKER_01: Um, Angan has invited Sam for matches. So I would think Sam would not participate. Um, he has not booked one yet. I'm not sure for what the reasons are. I don't know about storm. I will be reaching out to storm shortly because he does have time to prepare, but he's been off the grid. He's had a kid and a bunch of business stuff going on and everything. And he's doing daddy life right now. So.
SPEAKER_01: hopefully with time to prepare but he's the type of guy that you know might not tell anybody he's coming and just show up he's that type of dude so i don't know i don't know yeah i know we have um well i've just heard we have jerome loud coming which is going to be you know very aggressive 230. that's perfect because that's kind of his welcome alibi with his huge crazy hand
SPEAKER_04: Right, depending which class you want to qualify at, right? Because he, I think he has an option here of 220 and 242. If I'm correct, it's going to be 200 or 230. Right, right. But I mean, like, he can qualify here and whatever, I guess, right. But then in the finals, it has to be a 230. Yes. So, so that's how the runoff is like, if he goes in 42, you guys have to decide if you got a 220 and a 242, there has to be a runoff there.
SPEAKER_01: Right, but isn't it really going to be up to a guy if he's stuck in the 220, 242? Right? He's just going to be, hey, I'll be... So, like, if you have a 220 class, right? If you have a 220 and a 242, the promoter has to decide which class qualifies or they have to have a runoff of the top two of each class. So, like, there can only be two qualifiers at the 230. There can't be four.
SPEAKER_01: So that's something that maybe the promoters need to hear. I think Chance is tracking. I hope he is. But there will have to be some form of a runoff. So if you wind up with the top two in the finals there at 220 and then the top two at 242, like you got the winner and you got the runner up, there has to be a runoff there. So either that or you have to assign the 242 as the 230 class or whatever it may be.
SPEAKER_01: Earl ahead of time. Say this class qualifies and this one doesn't. Right. I'm trying to find the accurate weight classes. That's where it gets hairy. And that's why we chose to use the classes that Angan had so that we don't have the issue. And make no mistake about it. When the finals roll around, you got to make that weight.
SPEAKER_01: There ain't going to be no crazy like, hey, yeah, we're going to give you a five pound clothing allowance not to make the weight. So like if you qualify at 42 and you're pulling 230, you got to lose 12 pounds. So that's what it's about. That's about that's what it is being a professional. All right, my bad. OK, so our weight classes are 154, 176, 198, 220, 242 and 242 plus.
SPEAKER_01: Yep. So, I mean, you could look at it however you want. I mean, you got to have a runoff between the Supers and the 242s. You know, it's all how you want to do it. I wouldn't do that, though. I'd have a runoff to 220 and 242 and take the top two after the runoff. Yeah, 220 and 242s can run off to the top two for 230. And then 242 plus can be your 115 guys, right?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, there is no, so again, in the finals, the finals weight classes are going to be supers, 230, 200, and 170.
SPEAKER_01: so the finals like that's what's going to come out of the east and that's what's going to come out of the west and that's how they're going to pair the matches they're in between so our 54 and 76 is a runoff to one plus 198 198 stays to 22 42 collides and super stakes that's how i would do it if i was in that position because to me a 242 should be able to make 230 easier than
SPEAKER_01: let's say you know let's say a 220 you know i i would i would run the 220s and the 242s because i feel like they're better matched usually these guys are kind of around the same size and quite often the 242 is the easier class to win right so okay so this will be important for the guys to know that for sure who is caught up in that in that weight thing yeah okay let's come in anything cool
SPEAKER_04: um no there's really not questions that um there's some guy asking that he's he missed everything and just came in here it is a stream it will be safe so you can just come back and watch it we've talked about we've talked about dates we talked about left and right arm we talked about payouts what you're gonna get if you do win the thing and when and how you're gonna get your match and even perhaps how you're gonna get faced with opponent if you do win everything
SPEAKER_04: um we talked about what seemed that weight class issue seems if not every tournament will be a exact weight classes and this is if you're listening for what me and paul just went through and you have guys that might give you a headache or this might guys it's really like headache for a reason you know you might wanna you know because if you're just gonna complain and there are people that like that you do have like
SPEAKER_04: top dudes that are not supposed to face each other and you kind of have to break it apart. So you do have might have to consider that and switch it up. But that's OK. That's solid. I mean, I mean, this is this is why we're doing this, Ertem.
SPEAKER_01: I want to be able to, and I'm going to hate myself for doing this. My DMs are going to blow up. If you got any questions, DM me on Facebook or Instagram, okay? And don't get mad if I refer you to the tournament director in your area. I may just point you in another direction, or I may just point you at this video.
SPEAKER_01: so i wanted to put this video out i talked to hanging about it prior so we need to do some type of live we need to do some type of stream let's put it out here so we can just share the link when somebody asks a question here's the link everything you need to know and i think this pretty much sums it up i hope i'm going to kick myself later because i know i'm going to have forgotten something
SPEAKER_04: but i believe that pretty much sums us up it's a lot of stuff yeah if you guys have problems of reaching out and cannot get a hold of your promoter yeah you can message you can message paul you can message me probably everywhere but you're gonna get lost so message me on facebook or email me if you can email me i know you're serious and i know to reply otherwise i get too many different stuff so if that's important to you yeah find a way to reach out so
SPEAKER_01: yeah anything else jumping out in your head i mean i i think uh women's women's are two classes i think that's cut off at like 154. uh i could be wrong above and below you know um disqualifiers this question being answered but it's a question because i got asked what east versus west are they heading towards nine ten
SPEAKER_04: yes as paul just said and as it's i mean it's per engine to match it up properly you're probably most likely going to get matched up with the winners of perhaps the other countries qualifiers because the qualifiers happening all over the world so you might uh gonna get matched up as an eastern side uh however it's my understanding and how it goes it might also be more like a talent thing if you're the guy
SPEAKER_04: like you know maybe like chance or who knows maybe Adam Wojcicki decides to like re-show up right because yeah I don't know how exactly agreements work with like Engin but
SPEAKER_04: i haven't heard of any like prohibitions of people of stopping anybody from pulling so hey there may be some people that just want to prove a point and they'll show up and kill everybody and you know maybe england will have to adjust you know east which is west seven or like eight so i i believe it just secures you spot uh that's maybe anger needs to maybe for some people there needs to be some type of
SPEAKER_04: um consideration like hey you're guaranteed to have a match by the 11 right in case they're scared of not getting something right but right i mean but hey you're gonna you're gonna get a match but you're gonna get a match and it ang is a man of his word he has no contracts no nothing yeah yeah they've never been an issue with the guys of the utmost integrity
SPEAKER_04: you will get it yeah and then you know england is very generous to that too he will make sure this is happening but yes i guess in case if there's a question of that how soon you're gonna get it you're gonna get it but i guess everybody have to realize especially right now with the talks of maybe opening it to more easter people there's a big demand for you know for matches just as this right this and we can make 50 card matches and stuff so um
SPEAKER_01: but Angan's not going to call you or message you and say, okay, I have a match for you. You're on, he's going to make sure you can make, you know what I mean? Like, you know, now that match, that person you're offered, if it's on, let's say nine and you can't make nine and you have to do 10, like that, that, that all can change. So there will be a lot of consideration put into and a lot of scrutiny over you,
SPEAKER_01: know how you perform and how it matches up with others so like this is what angan does like full time is he just ponders what's going to be a good match who's going to match up good with who so whoever's on that list from the east in that weight class he's going to be thinking asking questions talking to everybody and figuring out what card it makes sense it doesn't make sense to put all of them on one card
SPEAKER_01: But I would assume two, maybe three cards, two on each event, maybe three on each event. It depends. We're shifting towards where he's going to do 10 or 12 per card and cut it down a little bit to cut out of some of his budget. But in his heart, I know he wants to do 20 matches. If he could, he would. So, I mean, who knows how it's going to go. But with the finals being in June,
SPEAKER_01: the earliest possible scenario would be um East versus West eight um which would only be a month later and and that and that's if you're like if you are the guy to
SPEAKER_04: um like if you're the guy like that kind of it makes sense right if you maybe be looked at before maybe something like who knows right because it's all uh we have a question from jamie but i can't answer that uh if you're on the roster already why the hell pull the qualifier
SPEAKER_04: yeah great question maybe if you just want to be a jerk i don't know or you got a point to prove so there's there's there's two sides to that coin well i i did something i don't know i think that's if engen needs to discuss it with certain athletes at certain level like i don't know like i don't know how much you guaranteed a match if you win or lose if you're part of the east versus west system or whatnot right
SPEAKER_04: so like if you a loser that means you all of a sudden like a person that needs to qualify or like what's going on so as i said earlier i have not heard of any prohibition or like not allowing anything so there's no prohibition and there's no like necessity per se for anybody who has lost a match or whatever the case that i know
SPEAKER_01: Um, I would say that if I potentially had lost my last match and I hadn't been called for East versus West seven or eight yet.
SPEAKER_04: that I might feel like, hey, I want to guarantee my slot. So I'm going to jump in, you know, prove myself, prove myself. I don't know about anybody else's situations, but if if anybody wants to see like my shoes, when I was demanding a match with Engin, Engin told me, you know, go win a qualifier and I'll watch it. So, you know, that's the boat I'm at. And, you know, there are some people that think like I should be on the card, but I'm not even on the card. So
SPEAKER_04: for me like you know if that puts a perspective for some people i don't know about if you already been on the card once that's a little e that's a funky thing to me because it technically you know you kind of already been somewhere where other people trying to get i don't know like it's a proper question i don't know why why and how but uh as i said engen had not prohibited anybody from not doing so i think what he wants you know basically talking to him is he wants
SPEAKER_01: the best from from the the united states or north america so like if you're the best in the united states he wants the best he wants the top two what's perceived as the top two oh another thing that we need to cover this is important and we should have talked about it earlier what constitutes somebody who can qualify right based on nationality ah yeah they have the law issue
SPEAKER_01: Now you can, you can correct me Ertem with what your mind, like I talked to Ang and I had a lot of chat back and forth with Ang about it. My perception is if you are a long-term resident of the United States in the active process of being a full-time resident or citizen, you are good to qualify in the United States. In the Northeast, we have a bunch of high level arm wrestling Georgii, multiple world champions in New York.
SPEAKER_01: like at every weight class there's a whole like community um and there's a lot of question around that like hey we don't want you know engen's basically like we don't want georgians over on visas coming over here because what happens if we match have to match them against another georgia we don't want you pulling people from the same country so that's where it gets kind of hairy um
SPEAKER_01: but a good a good person to refer to is like pablo i believe pablo has citizenship you have citizenship if you are in the process of getting citizenship have a green card that's totally fine my buddy goga uh is is good to go uh he's georgian so he'll be competing in there um so basically if you are a long-term resident in the process of
SPEAKER_04: you know, American citizenship or some way, shape or form, you are good to compete here. If not, you would have to compete in your home country. And that's where it gets weird and hairy. So it's not really weird and hairy. It's like, well, this is what we decided to do, like in this couple of months. And if you if you happen to be a vacation of the country making your money, you know, you should stick to it. The qualifier should not should not be your priority now. Right.
SPEAKER_01: you're out here working for your family so that's one of this or if arm wrestling is your thing you're flying back to your country right right so i mean i i have i have a feeling there's oh the last thing we gotta hit very important i'm glad we stayed on this long ifa waft bands aha okay listen here's how it works it's simple talk to simon bear show if you have not competed in ifa worlds
SPEAKER_01: You are good. Okay. End of story. If you have competed in IFA worlds, you're on that bad band list. You have an appeal process. Reach out to Simon, put the appeal in. I haven't heard of any really getting turned around. Okay. Like you, it's supposedly just a simple process. If you do not have that appeal process in, when you want to compete in the qualifier, you can understand.
SPEAKER_01: If you go to that finals and you have not gotten your appeal process through at the time in which your match is offered in Istanbul, you cannot go and it will default to the number two. It's that simple.
SPEAKER_04: I wonder why, because I thought Engin is more on WAF side and not even trying to be on really sides. How does IFA ban affects that? Engin is 100% with WAF.
SPEAKER_04: Right. Oh, gotcha, gotcha. Because you competed at the FA, you're banned by Voff. I got you. I had such a brain fart, I guess. Yeah, so Angan is in very good standing. I believe he spoke to Misha about it.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's very simple, cut and dry. Simon's frustrated with it because he doesn't keep the list. He doesn't know if the list is up to date, blah, blah, blah. I know that there's people who compete in the IFA Worlds. We get it. Put your appeal in if you want to participate. Do it now. Do it before your qualifier. Get it approved before. Got nothing to worry about. I told Ang and I don't think it's a big deal. I think at the end of the day, guys who win these qualifiers,
SPEAKER_01: If there's 18 guys that win qualifiers, we're dealing with one or two who might have competed in the IFA Worlds, if that, because I don't think that the Worlds was that overwhelmingly big. So we're dealing with a very small percentage of outside situations that can be dealt with through an appeal process.
SPEAKER_01: the worst case scenario we default to the number two so i don't think it's a huge deal it doesn't come into play until the time in which you go to istanbul but i would highly recommend anybody who has any concerns get their appeal processing before the finals okay all right well that's important one the james sheldon is out there uh fighting still for the ways to qualify which i get it it's a great subject so he said
SPEAKER_04: Well, let's be real here. There are three ways to get a call. Are you the best? If so, it's already known. Call granted, as we've seen. Option two is this new qualifier series, which is cool. Option three, to lesser extent than kicking on the table, if you've created a boss or a name, argue your way in.
SPEAKER_01: spot on nailed it okay so Jason Marlowe asking a question wow so me going to IFA 2021 I have to do an appeal process for East versus West if you went to IFA worlds yes and it's I believe it's simple just message Simon and Erlich Bacho I I the way I'm understanding it's a formality and for this exact reason Jason because
SPEAKER_01: we don't know like like what are we doing somebody gives us a world championship in the united states we go right i don't you know we haven't been to woff we're not really worried about it you know we've you know never been out of the country to arm wrestle hey uh well i mean to answer this i'm assuming corey already went through the process of appealing but corey miller won one ifa and pulled it east versus west right my assumption is that he did do the appeal process
SPEAKER_01: We'd have to confirm that. Or maybe that's one that just slipped by before it got hot and heavy. But I believe he did do the appeal process. And I would assume Herman did too. Right, because there was a couple people, right? So that's right. Unless it's been overlooked, I bet they can still redo it. So I don't think it's a big deal. The list of people who are banned is not held by Simon.
SPEAKER_01: or someone in the United States. It's held by Misha. He gets the list from Misha over there in WAF. Your name might not even be on the list.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I haven't seen the list. I can message Simon, but he's frustrated because the list hasn't been updated in a while. Right. So I guess, but from, from what you're saying, and that appeal is going to be almost just be positive thing. Just, just clear, make sure that your name is cleared out, make sure to reach out to, to the proper authorities and, uh, you know, just let them know, even if they don't see your name, but sound like they're not going to make your day harder. Just make sure you're good. Right.
SPEAKER_01: it's a cya anyway you you want that even if you did compete in ifa especially if you didn't know about the bands and everything else you'd want that appeal process in anyway right just because you know who knows if you want to go do something overseas might as well get it done anyhow right right exactly good very good point um
SPEAKER_04: yeah for everybody there's like a person that's 40 minutes late it's all good the thing gonna be saved we've talked we've covered every subject about um about seems like it's every subject and we got to the actual problematic stuff too by the way classes you know nationalities and and whatnot now it's all the good stuff what it's like to go to istanbul we covered it all
SPEAKER_04: right right right right right but we'll reach out for reach out to pauline once you get your call for the best places to get some food and shopping yeah yeah yeah you got the good bootleg stuff down there but i had to confer with artem to make sure i wasn't getting the terrible stuff that i got that grand bazaar is a beautiful place
SPEAKER_04: everybody were wrong about the grand bazaar too they're like oh it's going to be it's european side it's in euros it's expensive it's like no no it's not it's it's it was way better than going downtown yeah it's turkish it's awesome yeah it's good doug traded in all his bootleg stuff that he got downtown for better bootleg stuff he literally was haggling with him like i give you two bucks a cigarette in this bag for those
SPEAKER_04: That's awesome. Yeah. I was getting too much good stuff to where I'm like, Hey, I don't need the good stuff. I need the cheaper stuff. He was like, how much money you got? You got more money. I said, I just need 20 of these things so I can get a sandwich. That's awesome. Well,
SPEAKER_04: all right paul we've been up for for close to an hour and we probably covered a lot of stuff we i answered a couple of questions so again if anybody have any other questions that we didn't cover or you guys cannot find a qualifier near you for some reason or you can reach out to your promoter and you have sensitive questions and you're the guy you know feel free to reach out to me and paul on our social medias and we'll
SPEAKER_04: you know we either answer your question easy or we'll navigate you to the person that you need to be talked to so yeah don't ask gang and he'll just send you to me it's not worth it
SPEAKER_01: But yeah, thanks. Big shout out to East versus West and Angan just for doing this. I think it's an awesome concept. We as Americans, North Americans, general from the West, we need to support this with our best showing up, not just pros, but amateurs as well. Let's make these events great. The promoters are bending over backwards to make them happen on short notice. Go out and support your local promotions.
SPEAKER_01: T. John McCune, M.D.: get them going again the promoter or the the event itself is donating $2,000 to the finals so that's cutting into potential. T. John McCune, M.D.: You know potential red and green areas for those promoters to go out and support them it'll be a great environment you'll get to see the best in the country.
SPEAKER_04: and another thing you said uh about do not don't message engen if you have a problem with your local qualifier like i don't think he needs to hear it if he's not in charge of that if you have a problem with your something personal with your local qualifier probably message paul
SPEAKER_04: right he can be our original director for like some you know maybe inside problems but if you have problems with your local stuff deal with them with your local promoter right so please yeah don't bombard everybody around like i mean it's over yeah we're gonna have paul as a regional director and local problem try to direct talk to your local director so
SPEAKER_01: All right. I think that closes us out, man. I'm glad we got this done. Hopefully when questions come, we'll just send this link to you.
SPEAKER_04: yes sir all right everybody uh hopefully everybody got the questions answered and if we already replied where to get them answered if they're not being answered here and as i said one more time the links for the upcoming four qualifiers already in the description of this video the florida qualifier is this saturday and it's the very first link under this video if you want to find out and make a quick trip out of it yes sir
