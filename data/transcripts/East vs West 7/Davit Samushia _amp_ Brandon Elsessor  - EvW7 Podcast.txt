SPEAKER_00: uh yes it's uh been my dream for a very long time and i've pictured it in my head so many times and it's like i'm not even trying to force any thoughts in my head it's just like just the subconscious what's i just feel it you know what i mean that is how to become champion my friend first you dream then you you
SPEAKER_02: analyze you know what you need to do to reach that dream and then once you find out what is the way to do it then you pay the price and you perform and then you reach if you don't reach once then you try next one you know just this is how i did you know how i did uh but it doesn't mean that you are not gonna reach at the first try you know yeah i mean yeah the only real failure is giving up
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah yeah just yeah don't don't give up you know just you you I mean I will tell you something you know in fact you don't really lose when you lose an event you you you lose when you give up exactly are we live yet or yeah yeah we are live we are live I'm just waiting okay some someone else just came
SPEAKER_02: who is that okay roman came hello roman it's me hello hello thanks for inviting me as always hello brandon hey how are you doing are you in touch with david can you ask him if he's coming i don't even think that we need to i mean ask him we just need to make sure just yeah
SPEAKER_02: so you are losing your weight the question is i believe that you are good enough yeah okay but the question is will you remain the strength when you like like i talked with pauline today he said that you are very strong
SPEAKER_02: And you look very big and he says that you didn't really lose something, this is what he told me, but I would like to hear from you as well. How do you feel?
SPEAKER_00: So I've, uh, I've cut weight several times throughout my arm wrestling career. And every time I've done everything properly, I've been able to rehydrate and gain every ounce that I lost. And then some, and was able to maintain all my strength and energy and feel great during the events. So, um, this one I'm losing a little, a little more than I have. And so far it seemed to still be gaining strength and.
SPEAKER_02: and muscle and all that and still losing weight and i feel good so i think i'm fine hello hello david how are you my friend he's saying he's fine and he also asks how about you guys how are you doing yeah i'm fine great great yeah
SPEAKER_02: Tell him if it's possible to use the phone sideways. That's it. The question, Brandon, do you guys have, as far as I follow from outside, you guys have a team spirit. This is what I see.
SPEAKER_02: Like do you guys like keep in touch and give each other advices about anything for preparation?
SPEAKER_00: for sure um i i trained with a lot of guys from the the united states east versus west i've trained with several of them and like paul and for example he's he's pulled against david himself so and same with craig tooley i've gotten advice and tips from so you guys
SPEAKER_02: are by phone by meeting you know all the time in touch and then helping each other that's good that's good yeah yeah and you did you just say that like you didn't lose anything by losing the weight
SPEAKER_00: don't believe so all my uh lifts in the gym are still going up my my aren't just the feeling and my arm feels very connected everything's together tight healthy that i believe that i'm going to come in the strongest version that i've ever been in the most fire yeah you have 13 days but you are planning to kind of slow down right because the water cuts will start
SPEAKER_02: and like you wouldn't want to really push your limits right like in the last two weeks or something you don't want to like you you finish your like like maximum uh push training you finish you end it yeah yeah um
SPEAKER_00: Today was my last arm workout. Yesterday I did some chest. I just went up to like a moderate weight and just did reps and stuff like that. And today I did arms. I started off with some neutral grip pull-up holds and crazy heavy and switched to some moderate light pronation work and some wrist curls. From today on up to the competition, it's just crazy.
SPEAKER_02: resting and doing some light rehab work nothing crazy i understand but from now you will slow down you will be confident and focusing on weight loss and then gain the weight back in one and a half day that you have and and david uh my friend um first of all is the david or david is it t or d because right now i read as like it's b which one is the correct one
SPEAKER_03: So when Georgians call each other and call him, it's like at the end, not .
SPEAKER_02: Okay, because right now it's written like Davide, that's why I want to make sure because we always write Davide. And I think also his passport is Davide. Can you ask him how is his form? How did you write it, Mabam? Tell us about your form. I don't know the process of writing it. I wrote it, but I don't know how to write it.
SPEAKER_03: So he has done everything according to his plan, even though he got sick during this preparation time. Now everything is like behind. He's well prepared and soon he's about to start resting time.
SPEAKER_03: So everything is okay. Is he going to defend his title? Istanbul with the title? Yeah, for sure. No doubt. He's definitely going to defend his title.
SPEAKER_02: oh okay i i don't know like does anyone in this stream disagree with this come on brandon you don't disagree that you don't disagree with him that he said he's gonna leave istanbul with his title always i thought he just said he was going to uh bring it and try to defend it i didn't think he was saying that he was going to keep it
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, he's, he's gonna say he's gonna leave Istanbul with his title means he will come Istanbul. And when he leaves Istanbul, the title, which will be with him and he said is for sure. Oh, I'm not sure every day, uh, average 85 kilograms arm wrestler that he's competed against so far. And I plan on being the biggest problem that he has had to overcome. So he's gonna have to be ready. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Roman, did you hear that? Translate that to David. Let's say David doesn't talk so much usually, but I would like to hear what he thinks. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_03: So he's saying he is not a big fan of just talking in advance. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. But for sure, he's excited. And he said that during the table time, it will show who's going to do what.
SPEAKER_02: So yeah, he's excited. Yeah, if Brandon is like winning, then I'm going to give him a shield. And David already won three title matches. And according to what I announced, he was going to be like a shield. And once he wins three times, I was going to give shield and helmet. But I changed this thing and I decided to give
SPEAKER_02: one award for each defense so he already won three times so i owe him something i i owe him an axe battle battle axe already that's his if he if he wins this time he will have an armor you know warrior armor so he is coming he already have his axe if he wins he's gonna get the warrior armor and then brandon if he wins he's gonna get a uh
SPEAKER_03: So, does he know this? I will translate quickly.
SPEAKER_03: The title of the title is Najahhi, which means that he is your father. And if he is your father, it means that he is your father. And if he is your father, it means that he is your father. And if he is your father, it means that he is your father.
SPEAKER_04: He said that he will do his maximum. He will do his 100%. He will put everything on the table when time comes to pull.
SPEAKER_03: in order to not only defend his title, but also show that he has even progressed and surpassed his own previous type of fights that he showed us how much he is capable of. So he tries also to show that he is even better now than he was before. And one more question. Does he know a lot about his opponent? Did he study his opponent or he is just so confident that he doesn't really need that?
SPEAKER_04: Davit, what do you think is the most important thing? What do you think is the most important thing in your opinion? No, I think it's the sport. It's not that you have to do this or that. You just have to do your best and you'll get there. If you have a choice,
SPEAKER_04: I would like to say that this is a very important project. I would like to say that this is a very important project. I would like to say that this is a very important project. I would like to say that this is a very important project.
SPEAKER_03: So he said that he has seen a bunch of videos about Brandon. He knows how good in this weight category Brandon is. He also mentioned Brandon's last performance against Craig.
SPEAKER_03: so that we could also compare roughly the levels. He knows that Brandon has also been against David's last opponent. So he's looking very forward to it. He also said, like at the beginning, he said that, I don't want to say anything, even though I know how to pull. I'm not going to say the ways I will pull because maybe it will not happen as we planned.
SPEAKER_03: So basically he just wants to talk in advance for specific type of strategies and stuff. But he said that I know how good Brandon is. I know he's one of the toughest opponent in this weight class for me. So he will bring his best. That's what I would say. Okay, I said last question. I want to ask one more time. Does he think that stylistically, stylistically, is Brandon more dangerous for David than Craig was?
SPEAKER_03: It doesn't matter, you know, it's the same in a foreign.
SPEAKER_04: No, he is not. His style is different from Greg's and Brandon's. Both of them have very different positions.
SPEAKER_04: He said that stylistically,
SPEAKER_03: these two opponents of David, right now, if we compare, they are both different and they are equally, like he said, that they can deliver the toughness of the match on equal from their own style of pulling. Because he said that each guy pulls their own styles and which are different from each other. And David thinks that both styles
SPEAKER_02: what uh would be roughly equal uh tough for him so he could not say that brendan is gonna be any lighter craig was he was able to take craig inside game while brendan is going far out you know to the end like like like daniel prokop did so to beat david inside is not that easy
SPEAKER_02: But sometimes we see someone is taking his risk. That is why I said that, you know, Brandon's style, if more risky, then, of course, Craig also likes to go outside sometimes too, but he was not able to top roll David. So the match went inside game. Okay, so... I could re-ask if you want the points that you pointed out. I could also re-ask about this outside move if you want, or we could...
SPEAKER_02: no no if he thinks that it is like the same thing you know there's no difference he said that both styles are different and roughly the same no no i mean i mean what i'm just saying that like great likes to go boom you know like sideway with the risk so david was able to get inside you know while brandon is just like more like low and couple from defensive position so i was just thinking that maybe he would be
SPEAKER_02: more concerned about brandon's style so that that's why i wanted it uh anyway so brandon you heard your opponent he doesn't think that uh stylistically there is uh not much difference uh do you agree with that
SPEAKER_00: Well, I think he's saying that there is a difference in our styles, but he's saying the strengths in my style versus the strengths that Craig has in his style are roughly the same. Like we have the same amount of strength, but we just pull in different angles. Yeah, but where Craig is attacking is more David is, you know,
SPEAKER_02: know comfortable style you know while your style is we saw from the procop match that you know there is a possibility you know to get out of there you know and you are exactly getting the same place and you will probably on the competition day you will be near near 15 kilo heavier than daniel prokop that he was against uh david so
SPEAKER_00: that is my plan is at least my plan i don't think that your first primary plan is going inside with david but you know better i mean it's not my business you know right who knows maybe i'll just dive right in on him he won't see it coming yeah yeah stylistically i think that i present a um more of a threat than
SPEAKER_00: um his last opponent um just because i pulled differently and i think my style is could possibly be the the perfect style to pull against the v so and i'm good in the setup um i know how to uh manage all the different um things that are going on in the setup and how to get what i need and
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we'll see what happens on the day. I'm confident in my game plan and my abilities, and I know it is too, and he's very strong, and I got nothing but respect for him. I can't wait for the match and see how it plays. Yeah. The only thing is, Craig, is whenever I think of Craig, I'm thinking more of Cypress. Whenever I think of you, I'm thinking more of a specialist.
SPEAKER_02: about taking somebody's wrist, you know, just so much focused on taking there, you understand? So that is why I was thinking that, you know, it could be a little bit different. But anyway, so how do you see your chance, Brandon? I know with your heart, you know, you are going there to win 100%. There is no other possibility. That's how it should be. But like when you think with your mind, how do you see the possibility of beating?
SPEAKER_00: like what kind of percentage you would give to yourself and to him? How do you see that? Um, um, like I, I subconsciously in my head, I, I, it's hard to picture myself losing. I just, I've trained specific ways for, for so long and dreamed about, um, these types of moments that it's like almost become a reality before it's actually happened. But, but I know, um,
SPEAKER_02: David has been on that level, so I'm just going to say 50-50. Okay, so you're expecting, yeah. I understand. From your own perspective, you can picture yourself losing, but whenever you are saying it from outside look, you say that anything can be that much. I understand. Yeah. Anyway, so let's a little bit...
SPEAKER_02: focused on other matches. Let's see what your predictions are about those matches. Let's start with Pacho versus Adam Wozniński. David. David, I would like to start with you. As I said, we are going to talk about Pacho and Adam's matches.
SPEAKER_04: It's going to be an interesting match. It's going to be an interesting match for us. It's going to be an interesting match.
SPEAKER_04: uh is uh coming uh
SPEAKER_03: very young star upcoming uh Legend potential Legend he could become because how much strong he is right now and how how much he could also progress because he's so young uh and he's very certain on bacho's progress and achievements in this sport on the other side on the other hand we have Adam which that also thinks that he's very capable Armstrong very strong and he overall said 50 50 in this case
SPEAKER_03: You cannot clearly say one guy's favorite. Does Bacho need a top role Adam to win? I think Bacho needs a top role Adam to win. Bacho needs a top role Adam to win. Bacho needs a top role Adam to win. Bacho needs a top role Adam to win. Bacho needs a top role Adam to win.
SPEAKER_04: Every position is very important to me, whether it's in the pitch or what. I don't know if there are specific rules or not, but every position is very important to me. No matter where I stand or what I do, every position is very important to me. I don't know what to say. Every position is important to me.
SPEAKER_03: Well, Dawit said that Bacho, as far as he knows of Bacho's capabilities, he said a bit more in detail. So he said, first of all, physically, the anthropometrics of Bacho is very gifted for the arm wrestling because he said that he's
SPEAKER_03: bone structure is thick and also hands are massive to his age, what Bacho is, and that will for sure help him against anyone. In this case, he did not say any specific type of pulling ways to be efficient against Adam. He said that Bacho, as far as he knows, is very versatile and he could technically go wherever a match requires to
SPEAKER_02: go on. He said that if he takes inside to beat Adam, Bacho will go there. If he takes outside, Bacho is capable to do that as well. And basically any way he's capable. So he would be competitive in either way. And Brandon, do you have any idea about this match? I asked David because David knows both guys. Well, you know Adam, but not much about Bacho. What do you think? Do you think 18 years old
SPEAKER_00: young guy can just suddenly get out of his country and then do something unexpected at high-level stage? Right. Yeah, for me, it's unpredictable because I just don't know enough about Bacho. I've seen some of his weightlifting videos, which are pretty good. He seems very strong. I've seen him win dominantly in juniors world championships, I believe.
SPEAKER_00: and but the thing is it's the the level between juniors and seniors is completely on a different level say that wasn't even junior it was sub junior under 15 years old it was
SPEAKER_00: Right. Yeah. And just difference from juniors to seniors is like in a different world. So, um, I'd have to go with Adam and until proven otherwise, I think if I go. Bacho is going to have to finish them quick. The longer the match stops inside, I get definitely give it to Adam. Yeah. Yeah. And do you guys, do you guys like realize that the danger that may be coming?
SPEAKER_03: for the winner of your match, maybe. Looking forward. Eventually, eventually. What does he say?
SPEAKER_02: He says that everything is possible. I'm like 70%, 75% by today. I just come training. First time pull up after the bicep there and we will see. But Brandon, if you win this one, I'm joking. I don't think I can be ready for July, but I mean, I can be ready, but not for the title level. Is there anyone
SPEAKER_02: your mind that you would like to face like would you who would you want to face like anyone that i was dead but you know that it's title match you will get the office openings you know oh man i haven't put a whole lot of thought into that david and i i haven't even been thinking about who's next anything else right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it wasn't a good question maybe it'll be too someday keep training
SPEAKER_02: And David, if you win this one, is there anyone that you would like to face? You know, Zola lost at AMC, but two weeks later, he came and beat the AMC winner that he lost at the AMC, like nothing at the Russian Nations, only two weeks later. He lost him badly, and then he killed him two weeks later. I don't know what happened, but if you beat Brandon, would you
SPEAKER_03: prepare to pull if he doesn't lose again until that time, of course. I'm not going to say if he loses somewhere else, you know. But how would you think about him? Enki, before I ask that question, what would be the weight category? Because most likely Dawood will ask. So in which weight? In 85? They are doing 85 kilo category. All right. As far as I know. Yeah. Dawood, they say, Ya Hashem, Qolada, Qolada, Martreda.
SPEAKER_03: What do you think, Marju, what do you think will happen in the future, in the next 45 years, if the government stops working? I think the government will continue to work, and when they get rid of us, they will continue to work.
SPEAKER_03: so in any ways he will be ready whenever that happens if that happens and if the match is set up he will do he live he will do his maximum he will do his best to beat solo whenever it is set to be done and i understand but first he needs to be branded yeah yeah yeah and daniel prokop versus
SPEAKER_00: dog courage brandon oh there's some tough uh predictions that's i guess that's why these matches are on this card because anything could happen that's his first mistake yeah it's hard to say i i it's really hard to say daniel's amazing every time i see him and and doug's just came back and dominated at the last one and looked really good um just say 50 50 either way
SPEAKER_03: I understand. And David? David, you know Dr. Sipul Koltrey in the last events and... David, I would like to ask Prokopchuk and Erlich to talk a little bit about this, because I know that Erlich and Koltrey have been talking about this for a long time. Thank you, Vitsi. Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_04: He told me he obviously knows Ehrlich. They are friends. He said that Daniel is really
SPEAKER_03: like one of the best, if not the best in his weight category. And, uh, he thinks, uh, 60% to 44 favorite in, in favor of, you know, Daniel. Yeah. And let's go to another match. And when I asked in percentage this time, uh, David, David's coming to versus Brandon assessor. No, it's how.
SPEAKER_04: and then he became the president. David was the president. I don't know. I think it was in the 80s or 90s. I think it was in the 80s or 90s. I think it was in the 80s or 90s. I think it was in the 80s or 90s. I think it was in the 80s or 90s.
SPEAKER_04: It's not like there's a lot of money in the bank. It's not like there's a lot of money in the bank. It's not like there's a lot of money in the bank. It's not like there's a lot of money in the bank. It's not like there's a lot of money in the bank. It's not like there's a lot of money in the bank. It's not like there's a lot of money in the bank.
SPEAKER_03: So in his opinion, like honest opinion, uh, most, uh, um, efficient and like probable, uh, uh, prediction to give like percentage wise, like you asked is 50 50 because, uh, he thinks, uh, the way they both beat, uh, uh, correct earlier, uh, was like, he cannot say that, uh, one guy beat the, uh, uh, the opponent easier than the other. He said that I also.
SPEAKER_03: even though the score was maybe different than Brandon's and Craig's score, he still said that I did not win easy. I had to fight. So he's saying that we both have win on this last, our last opponent. So I think 50-50, that's what he said. So he is saying that, you know, even though he looked like he's in control, but he was having a hard time with Craig. Yes, that's exactly what he underlined. Yeah. Yeah. He had to fight. He had to fight.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, he won the match 3-0. He could pretend like it was easy, but he's giving the credit that his opponent deserves. So it's great sportsmanship from him. Bravo, bravo, David. No ego.
SPEAKER_00: And how do you see this? You said already, right? 50-50, Brandon. I think you asked this both earlier. I did say 50-50, but I'm going to change it because I think on paper, I'm technically the underdog against David. And I love being the underdog because I perform much better. I have more to prove during that match. So I'm just going to say 80-20 for David because I just love proving people. And I bring the fire that way.
SPEAKER_03: I see this strategy. He asked me to translate what Brendan said.
SPEAKER_03: . . .
SPEAKER_02: yeah he wishes you best of luck thank you nothing but respect for him i can't wait that's good but i i think brandon really liked that that that thing that david said that when he said that he really really really had you know tough time with craig i think that is exactly what brandon wanted to hear as well you know
SPEAKER_00: Did it help your confidence, Brandon, to hear that? It didn't change anything, per se. To me, the match looked, it didn't look completely dominant. I think Craig held him in a couple spots and got into some hard spots to hang on to, and he still kind of held in there for a little bit. I think Craig has the power. He just wasn't able to lay it down.
SPEAKER_02: so yeah more endurance maybe he he is explosive instead max power was not below david's but david can pull forever you understand yeah maybe maybe craig couldn't stay at that level uh so long but who knows you know david was able to keep craig out of his lane too right at the start of the match i believe
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, one round he lost it, but the other rounds, when Craig was in offensive position, he got fouled out, if I'm not mistaken. This is how I remember, yeah. Anyway, so let's go another match. Alijan Murado versus Kody Merritt, Davids. Alijan Murado and Merritt were on the same team, Kody. Yeah, Kody was on the same team, Alijan Murado was on the same team.
SPEAKER_04: Considering that he knows both arm wrestlers, he has good enough information of both arm wrestlers.
SPEAKER_03: I will put microphones closer. I hope it helps. So basically, he said that even though he knows, considering that he knows both armwrestlers, how they pull each other, how they would pull each other, he thinks that Alijan has like 80% of chance to win. So he said 80% to 20% for Alijan's win.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, even though he respects both of them, he has to be objective in this case. I understand. And you, Brandon? Alizan looked like such a beast against Oleg Petrenko, and his left really amazed me. They're pulling left-handed, right? Him and Kobe? Okay, yeah, he really amazed me, and I was like,
SPEAKER_00: became a huge fan of him after that match. It was my first time seeing him. Cody's a big, strong guy. I got to give the edge to Elijan. He just seems like he's just as elite as they come. I'll say probably 75, 25 Elijan. Cody's a big guy. He's built heavier than Oleg, so...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but about 120 pounds heavier than. Yeah, that that definitely makes it harder to predict. That's a lot. That's a lot. Actually, that's a lot of strength. Second, 120 pounds. Yeah, I won't be. I won't be surprised if he top rolls. But we will see if he can go either way. Yeah, but I just want to be around 210 pounds and.
SPEAKER_02: being in conversation against those super heavyweights is just something incredible, I believe. Oh, Alizhan's only 210? Yeah, the guy is. Well, that's tough. Cody's hard to deal with for a 210-pounder. Yeah, but it was the same with Petrenko, who was 230. He was, yeah. But Alizhan also competed in the World Armwrestling
SPEAKER_02: federations world championships in super heavyweight category only like six months ago he won the super heavyweight while he was like 200 and maybe three pounds or something that's insane yeah yeah the guy is incredible yeah but we all have limits we will see you know if it will be his limit or not you know yeah yeah and how about uh
SPEAKER_04: Arif Ertem vs. Dzharanov, David. David, Arif and Dzharanov. I think it was in the 20th or 21st century. I don't know, I don't know about the other sportsmen. It's hard to say. You can't say that it was in the 20th or 21st century. It was in the 30s or 40s.
SPEAKER_04: He said that obviously he knows both arm wrestlers. He knows how strong they are.
SPEAKER_03: And he says 50-50. It would be a very exciting match, very tough match for either of the armistlers. And he expects the war between these two guys, 50-50%. And what do you think, Brendan? I don't know enough about either one of them to make a prediction on that match. Okay, then let's go to Rob versus Zurab. You start, Brendan.
SPEAKER_00: That's an interesting match. Um, I just had the opportunity to practice with Rob, uh, about a month or so ago. And he's, I, um, he's got the tools, I believe to beat zero. Um, I think they both have the tools to win that match. It's gonna come down to who can, um, get to their lane and keep their opponent out of, out of their own lane and.
SPEAKER_00: For Rob, I think a lot of that comes down to his own mindset during the day. So if Rob is feeling confident and strong, I'll say 50-50. So you are saying that Rob has potential to win that match, but we will see his preparation and how
SPEAKER_00: mentally he will carry himself to the table and how he will perform. You're saying that if he performs at his best, that he has a chance to win that match? Yeah, I think if he comes in kind of sluggish or just not ready for war, he could be in trouble. But I think he'll be ready because it's a big opportunity. And I think it'll be. Yeah. And can you ask David how he sees this match?
SPEAKER_04: What do you think about the future? I don't know. I don't want to say that there is no future. There are all sorts of possibilities.
SPEAKER_04: There was a lot of damage in that sport. There was a lot of damage in that sport. There was a lot of damage in that sport. There was a period when there was a lot of injury. There was a period when there was a lot of injury. There was a period when there was a lot of injury. There was a period when there was a lot of injury. There was a period when there was a lot of injury.
SPEAKER_04: Basically, he said that Zurab has like 18% to 20% of the chance
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he's saying that all the time, all these previous matches that Zurab has had, he had some issues, some minor issues all the time. Like he could not always deliver 100% because David knows how good Zurab is. He said that Zurab's machine is like really, really good shape right now. He has no issues, no pains, nothing.
SPEAKER_03: neither in wrist nor in arm or anything else. So he expects to see the best version of Zurab we have ever seen in this East vs West event. Okay, right now Zurab at his best ever and then he thinks that he's going to win. 82-20%, yeah. Okay, okay. And so let's go to the next one.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, we go Pauline versus Sasha, Brandon. Paul is one of my regular training partners. I drive to his hometown and train with him often. And he is definitely the strongest that he has ever been right now. And I think Paul's a beast and I think he's gonna win. We'll say 65, 35, Paul.
SPEAKER_04: For Paul? For Paul, yes. And Davide? What do you think, Davide? I think that in 2018-1919 it will be like this. In the second season, Sasho Andreev, Kaikhani,
SPEAKER_04: It's not easy to take a break from it, it's a difficult period. In the form of Pauline, you can see that when he left with his father, he was very damaged, and he had to retire from sports. And he left from there in 1850-1850.
SPEAKER_03: He said he knows, obviously, both athletes and Sasho. Unfortunately, he doesn't have any updated information because of the lack of performance that Sasho has had. But he knows that Sasho could deliver a very, very tough match against Paul. On the other hand, Paul Lin has always been progressing, as we see. And judging by his last performance against Babayev, he was very
SPEAKER_03: um like showing how good he is actually and he can be in specific angles and he thinks 50 50 for this match both have equal chances to beat either of them i understand yeah
SPEAKER_03: But Sasho, he said that he has been following Sasho just one more transition. No, he's been, ah, he said, okay, I will ask, I will re-ask.
SPEAKER_04: It was in the form of Adre Ukates. It was in the form of Adre Ukates. It was in the form of Adre Ukates. In the form of Adre Ukates.
SPEAKER_03: He has seen, obviously, he has seen. He just told me specifically to make me understand what he meant. He said that previous shapes of Sasho was better, he thinks. In his personal opinion, Sasho has been even better than his last performance we saw. And that's the reason why he says 50-50. Otherwise, he would say Sasho is fair. Yeah, I mean, I don't want to get in more with the chat, but this history beats the idiot.
SPEAKER_02: um listen to me idiot i don't said 85 kilo guys against 95 kilobytes holden will be it is 95 kilo category and brandon and david is 85 kilo category and both zurab and rob vision will weigh the same okay and john and iraqi both pull under 105 kilo like i mean just
SPEAKER_02: why you come here and just spread your ignorance and shit, you know, just go somewhere else, my friend. Everyone is doing well until like toxic people like yourself, not only toxic, but also ignorant. Please stay away, you know. And so let's go to another. All these guys will weigh exactly the same. Zurab Rab, exactly the same. David Brandon, exactly the same. Pauline and
SPEAKER_02: uh sasho they all same category you know i'm not setting anyone like this and that you know okay let's go to do another one um man it's uh
SPEAKER_02: I don't know how good really either of their lefts are. Is Vitaly's left better than his right, or is his right better? I've heard rumors. I don't think so. I don't think so. I have seen him, you know, like sometimes people are more successful if their arms are equally the same, but the competition with left are maybe a little bit weaker than the competition with right.
SPEAKER_02: know sometimes but like for example i have seen him compete in the waffles and beating this i don't know with right arm and losing against this i don't know with left arm but i have seen him competing against crossing and losing with right arm and beating crusty left arm but i know that cross his left especially in his prime wasn't as good as his uh rights but like it is so hard you know he said it's healthy but just think about it since 2000 probably 18.
SPEAKER_02: did not really i don't think he did any super match with left arm or something you know what right arm he was regular but i should know that toby's left arm is better than his right like according to his coach
SPEAKER_03: Engin, you were lagging a bit, but I think now... Yeah. Now I think it's okay. You hear me? Yeah, we hear you, yeah. But the video was lagging, but we heard everything you said, yeah. I don't know. It looks like you're frozen. Maybe I'm frozen. Yeah. So, I mean, Brendan... Brendan, you heard what he said about Vital, right? I heard. For me, audio was no issue.
SPEAKER_03: yeah he was talking about krazy and desert and who's into one right and left and then the other yeah i heard all of that yeah i mean we could assume that literally left is almost as good i don't know i've heard rumors that he he's has said that he left is very good compared to uh right arm but anyways i will ask also david maybe he has different opinions
SPEAKER_04: David, can you tell us about Vitaly's life? I think Vitaly was born in… I think he was probably in his forties or fifties.
SPEAKER_04: He's saying... .
SPEAKER_03: He's giving Laletin favor like 10% or so. So he's saying that it could be 50-50 as well, but he thinks that 60-40 for Laletin because of the anthropometrics, like longer leverage, he thinks that Italy is going to utilize to beat Tobias. Yeah, I think I didn't have the connection for a while. Did you give your prediction, Brandon?
SPEAKER_02: um yeah i i'll just say uh um probably 50 50. hard to predict okay okay yeah and let's go to next one dave chef versus well which are you letting i'm sorry there was
SPEAKER_04: This is a very difficult period. We are in a very difficult situation. We are in a very difficult situation. We are in a very difficult situation. We are in a very difficult situation.
SPEAKER_04: David's point of view, he's saying the match is 50-50.
SPEAKER_03: because he has recently trained with Revas and he said that not only Revas got bigger, he gained several kgs, but also stronger. He knows that Revas is in his best shape we have seen on East vs West. We haven't seen so far, so this is Revas' best shape he will deliver. But also we obviously cannot deny how strong
SPEAKER_02: Davies, how dominant he can be. So it will be a very exciting match. Dawid said that it would be a good fight and 50-50. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And somebody wrote that he won Matushenko on Laletin pull, but it was not super recent. Also, Matushenko around those times, you know, was even less than 110 kilos. So like, it is like more like something
SPEAKER_02: light heavyweight versus a super heavyweight match. Anyways, and Brandon, how do you see this match? Dave Chaffee versus Ravas?
SPEAKER_00: Ray Vas looks very strong and powerful. He looked good against Michael Todd. I think Dave's just presents so much power and drag and pronation in his hand. I think it could present a real problem for Ray Vas to utilize. I'm going to go Dave 60-40. Dave 60-40.
SPEAKER_02: It is mostly, I ask everyone, it's because of his powerful side pressure. Yeah, yeah, he's very powerful. I'm going to give him the edge for that. Have you trained with him lately or anytime? Because I think you live near each other, like in the same state or something.
SPEAKER_00: I'm one state from him. He's about three hours from me. I used to train with him weekly for years until he started working on night shift and now he can only train on Wednesdays and with my work schedule, I'm unable to make it. I went there once like three to five months ago and that was the last time I trained with him in a long time. I understand, yeah. But most of the American team is
SPEAKER_02: in the northeast region right that's probably about half of us at least yeah yeah maybe even more like adam down there douglas used to be there but now in like down there in south i think right douglas douglas oh doug yeah i'm not sure where he lives exactly yeah he's probably several states at least you know i think he's like right above florida i think it's somewhere like
SPEAKER_02: out of georgia or something i i'm not sure anyways and yeah and let's go david very important match iraqli zrakashvili versus good match
SPEAKER_04: I don't know if it was in the 1950s or the 1950s, I don't know. I think it was in the 1950s or the 1950s. It was a very real event, because it was with the Hungarians and the Zirakashvili. Zirakashvili was in the form of the Soviet Union. It was in the 1950s or the 1950s.
SPEAKER_04: It seems to be very realistic, because, for example, a professional athlete can participate in this sport.
SPEAKER_03: This fight, this matchup is very exciting to David. He's saying that both could beat the other guy. 50-50 percent chance for both of them. He's saying that we know how good Kirgal is. We know also Irakli keeps progressing and he's also very strong. And he said that it's going to be an exciting match. They both can deliver.
SPEAKER_02: uh good enough arm wrestling to beat the other guy so it's it could go either way yeah it's very interesting yeah it's very interesting for him i'm sorry did you say my name you know these guys like ongarbe in iraq they are not from west but i'm sure that you are following them like what they have been doing yeah
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely. Some of the numbers that Iraqli puts up in the gym with like back pressure lifts and stuff like that is like insane for his size. And the performances that Angerbaev has had against guys like Michael Todd is like,
SPEAKER_00: exact just like unhuman for for both of them for their feats that they've shown so far it makes it a very exciting matchup and i can't really predict who is going to win that so 50 50. so you you have no prediction
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm going to say 50-50. It could go either way. I'll say 60-40 for Angarbaev because he's the champ right now. I haven't proven it yet. Yes. Also, guys, the trading cards, 95% sold out. It is almost, I mean, almost sold out. 95% of them already sold.
SPEAKER_02: Just inform me, because after the event, I had like maybe 100 people. I don't remember how many, but they were asking if anything left. So I'm just telling you, if you are looking for, don't be late. And last match, David, Gennady versus Devon. First of all, can you ask him, when did he see Gennady last time in training? And what is Gennady's shape?
SPEAKER_04: I would like to ask you, Mr. Sanam, what is your opinion about the current situation of the G20? What do you think about the current situation of the G20? Of course, the current situation of the G20 is not the same as before. But during the period of the first elections, the G20 was one of the leaders and one of the leaders of the previous elections.
SPEAKER_04: Now, let's talk about Gennadiy. Gennadiy is a very important person in the Ottoman Empire.
SPEAKER_04: It was in a different form. Now, my opinion is that it is a very, very strong revolution and a very strong transformation. It is very strong, it is in a different form, it is real, it is very strong.
SPEAKER_04: This is the result of the fact that Souspa Gennadi is still alive. In this context, I would like to point out that the legend of Devon Larratt and his deputies were the descendants of Gennadi in 1820. In fact, it is clear that Gennadi died during this period.
SPEAKER_04: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: was like they saw each other 10 days prior like 10 days ago they saw each other so like roughly two weeks ago they met all this time they were they've been preparing for their own matches to get
SPEAKER_03: all this time, like entire preparation, basically they were training together. So Dawit knows in what type of weights Gennady was lifting, what type of the shape he was getting, progressing and progressing, doing all this preparation, because he kept repeating, I know we've been doing it all together for our preparation. And he said that because of that, how I know how good Gennady is right now, it's like double more.
SPEAKER_03: best shape Gennady we have ever seen, he's saying. He's claiming, actually. He said that regardless, obviously, big respect towards Devin. He's the legend of the sport, but he knows how well-prepared Gennady is, how much he got shocked by Gennady's performance when they kept training together. He thinks 80% to 20% Gennady will beat Devin. So Gennady is in a shape that David has never seen before.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah it is almost two times better it is not only legal but it is like much better this is what he is saying basically yes yes yes two times better thing i wouldn't buy but you know i understand that it is like much better yeah what was that he asked me to also translate what you were saying so i will just briefly uh tell him that you also asked
SPEAKER_04: It is clear that there is no such thing as a very strong Genadi. I would like to say that Genadi is in a very strong form. Genadi is a very strong Genadi. Genadi is a very strong Genadi. Genadi is a very strong Genadi. Genadi is very strong Genadi.
SPEAKER_04: He said that
SPEAKER_03: last years, like they've been, uh, they, he has experienced to be preparing and training with Gennady last years. So, uh, and he said that considering the years before, uh, and all the knowledge that I had prior to this preparation, all this knowledge that, uh, that we had about how, how much weights Gennady was pulling and, uh, lifting.
SPEAKER_03: They are tremendously increased right now. We said that much bigger weights he's pulling right now. Did you see him at the table training as well? Did you see him at the table training as well? Did you see him at the table training as well? Did you see him at the table training as well?
SPEAKER_04: . . . . .
SPEAKER_03: Dawid personally, he has seen Gennady's part of the training more outside of table than on the table. But he knows, he said that Gennady is one of the smartest poolers. He knows also how to train. He's very smart. It's the training regimes. And he said,
SPEAKER_03: Guarantee definitely all these increased weights he will deliver at the table. And also he said that obviously he's doing on the table this type of lifts. But then I specifically asked against the opponents doing sparring. And he said that on that one, he doesn't have enough information. But he says that all these lifts, Gennady is very smart. He will deliver on the table as well. And he is saying that because of the weight training,
SPEAKER_00: he thinks it is 80% favors. Yeah, 80 to 20, that's what. And Brandon, what do you think about this match? Well, according to what David said and Gennady's lifting much bigger weights now, that's good. But with...
SPEAKER_00: lifting heavier weights comes a loss of endurance, I believe. And there's one thing Devin is very good at stopping the match and bleeding guys out. And if you are short on endurance and any level, he can, um, really bleed you out really well. I think, uh, Gennady, if he's that strong, I think he can get, I think he might win the first or second, first two rounds and
SPEAKER_00: Maybe Devin will get a stop on him and then just it'll be Devin's match from there. So I would say 60-40 for Devin. And you are saying that there is a chance for Kennedy to win early rounds or rounds? Yeah, I mean, he could possibly win every round. But I think Devin will find a way to stop the match and blow up his hand and arm and come out on top.
SPEAKER_02: I understand. I understand. Yeah. Anyway, so only, only like what, one and a half week that I will see you guys. Are you guys excited? I'm sure David is so used to, but you excited, Brandon?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I'm very much looking forward to it. I appreciate the opportunity so much. It's been my dream for a long time to make it this far. So I'm going to do my best to prove that I belong here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But trust me, this is why I'm organizing this event, you know, to give the opportunity to people who deserve, you know,
SPEAKER_02: And I thank you very much for accepting the offer, accepting the match. And I wish you the best, my friend. Thank you very much. You too, man. I'll see you in a couple of weeks. Yes, yes. And tell David that, as always, we will be honored to have him here. And tell him to stay safe. And I also wish him the best. And if there is anything more you guys want to add,
SPEAKER_03: Now you guys can add and then we can finish the podcast. Yes, that's right. Thank you very much for our chat. I would like to thank you again and again for being so active in this sport. Specifically, I would like to thank you for your support and support.

SPEAKER_03: Thank you. He says quite opposite, I thank you because of the opportunities you are giving me. He said that he appreciates all these things that you are doing for the sport.
SPEAKER_03: uh and then at last he said that um i know he has said about our possible match so he means you and himself and he is looking forward to it as well and he wishes that to happen very soon yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm still too weak too weak and i don't know uh i don't know he will have that opportunity as someone in this podcast may disagree with him even though he he predicted us
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. And still you can tell him that I'm like far, far from their level. I'm trying to get ready and tell him that as anyone else who came to East versus West, they don't need to thank me. These events are great because of their presence. Thank you. Thank you.
