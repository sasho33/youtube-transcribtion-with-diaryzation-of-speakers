I became the world champion for the last time. I became the world champion for the last time in 1994. I became the world champion for the last time in 2018, between the first and last years of the 24-year period. After me, it was the most popular event in 16 years.

Unnecessary things is different. You know, just like all the time, talk, talk, talk, talk. Like a bee that doesn't produce
SPEAKER_02: Honey, doesn't make honey. That is bad. That's all my life. I choose to be the one who is doing it. That's why I won countless world titles.

SPEAKER_00: yep wild horse should be coming in a minute so you guys tell us where you are from what's your name you know yeah so so actually originally i was born in ukraine or the last like seven years ago i moved to poland and now i am living permanently in poland and i trained here with the best club in poland nidvedia so yeah
SPEAKER_02: okay that's good good to have you here thank you for being part of it and you yes sir i'm pakistan mushaid my name is mushaid i'm 23 years old and doing arm wrestling since five years yeah and welcome also thank you thank you hello matt thank you how's it going it's good to see you nice hair nice hair yeah yeah you too looking good hey better than mine for sure yeah
SPEAKER_02: I had that look before I got this look, right? Yeah. You know, Sean, Sean, he also like connected me with those guys who did your hair. And then they said they would do it. You know, for free. I didn't go. I didn't go. I'm so lazy. So lazy guy. Yeah. You're chicken shit.
SPEAKER_03: here take a check that's that's the only reason you got me on you're like i just wanted to actually see for sure exactly how well it worked to see if you wanted to commit or not it looks good
SPEAKER_03: yeah i'm happy with it like for compared to what it was i got way more of a hairline than i did before right so it's still a little little thin up top but they can only do so much with it so yeah yeah so much at a time right so so let it go for a bit and then i can always go back and get a little more filled in up top if i wanted so yeah as much as it responds you know they can do as you said yeah yeah actually it looks naturally so it seems to be okay
SPEAKER_02: yeah it's not all jagged or straight across like you get some of them some people get down right so yeah that's good yeah and silky wilkie thank you for very generous superchats sorry can't watch the stream but good day to you all say hello to matt mass for me tell him to turn and burn like a plain propeller
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what that means. Oh, what popular? No, propeller. Oh, turn and burn like a propeller. Yeah. On a plane, the propellers, you know? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, right on. Yeah, and how, okay, here is Sean also. Thank you for your support. Come on, Engie. Get that hair transplant. You won't regret it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right, but I'm just
SPEAKER_03: like they told me so many scary stories, you know, you cannot do this, you cannot do that, it burns or something, you cannot touch water. What was it? A lot of things, I think, that you need to be careful about. You just can't physically touch it, right? You can't use hot water on it the first couple of weeks or whatever, but it's actually not that bad. It's just, you know, kind of sitting up straight for the first 10 days as opposed to resting your head on a pillow is the only thing, right?
SPEAKER_03: and then nine hours if you're laying there nine hours eight hours something like that eight hours wow yeah you can just go have a nap take an afternoon nap right yeah yeah but they don't put me in sleep right no they'll give you out of that if you want okay yeah yeah just helps you calm down right yeah yeah i understand yeah anyway so matt
SPEAKER_02: How is everything, my friends? How is everything? You choose, you choose. Very, very, like, you choose Jordan Sonev that very, very seldom you can see someone can topple him. You managed to do that a few times without the strap. But in strap, it's because the guy is tall, long reach, and hook inability is incredible. And...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he was like a very tough matchup, very tough one. Yeah, no, he definitely impressed me. I wasn't expecting him to be as powerful as he was. I actually thought even if he did get what he needed,
SPEAKER_03: even in or out of the strap but uh i'm really starting to learn especially at this level or at that level if if you are competing if they get anything that they need it's game over right so it's uh just about i think it's more more problem with me having to go back to my grassroots right
SPEAKER_03: so where I initially started the thing that got me to where I was in the first place I believe I've kind of lost I've gotten away from it I think I've caught blocked myself with the way I've been training so so it's you know right now it's just a trial and error I believe so going forward yeah but but it's a different kind of experience to meet like people other than North Americans because
SPEAKER_02: They are different, different. You need to really pull these people to figure out, you know, what it is. And now with the East versus West, the North Americans and the Eastern Polar, you know, often they are meeting. I think that both sides are learning a lot of things.
SPEAKER_03: and well is it yeah right like and it's great that we're actually able to get this opportunity to build to bang with with the eastern polars and vice versa with the eastern polars with the western polars right where it's actually worth worthwhile going over there getting a flight and actually being able to participate in such a thing right so i think it's fun right now is you know the perfect perfect time to be around in arm wrestling so yes i'm very happy because
SPEAKER_02: you are one of those guys that, you know, like heavily inspire the fans with your energy. And like, it would be so sad to see you, okay, I'm done. But instead, I saw you made a post, you think I'm gonna go away? No, and then you're gonna just like, that was like very good to read after the event, you know, just never give up, my friend, never give up.
SPEAKER_03: no and it wasn't like it wasn't me thinking i was going to or contemplating it was more so addressing some of the comments or some of the videos that were put out there because of my performance recently and it's like you know anybody you know yourself
SPEAKER_03: very well that if every time you fucking took a loss you just walk away from something or if you tried something and it didn't work you're just going to give up you you would have been you want to spend 35 40 years dominating the sport the way you did right you know like it's you know nobody anybody that just gives up easily just because of a couple losses or a couple punches in the chin doesn't
SPEAKER_03: I'm doing it because I love it, not because I'm getting notoriety and everything else for it. It's like, yeah, it's great that I'm able to get some of it being involved in the sport. But the whole reason why and how I got to where I was was because of the passion that I had for the sport. And the passion is still there. It's stronger than it ever has been. So you're going to have to chop my fucking arms off if you want me to quit.
SPEAKER_02: Trust me, trust me that this nature inspires me more than the people who come, win and just go away, you know, just like, like forever battle is the like thing that, you know, I believe in forever, you know, like.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, there is no possibility that you to be on the battleground and never fall down. You lose, in fact, when you refuse to get up. That's why. But some people, because they have never been there, they don't know what we feel, and they like to make fun and say things to make fun, but never, never, ever
SPEAKER_02: make fun with a warrior. I always tell to my students, you know, just go there, lose by being very brave and paying the price before the event, then just going and then shaking your legs, shaking and winning there, you understand? You just go there, you are responsible to fight, you know? That's why we are, you know, I believe warriors, you know, like not because we win,
SPEAKER_02: it's better when we win if it's even the best if you all the time win but unfortunately there are two incredibly high level pillars they meet each other one of them will lose yeah yeah somebody's got to lose right there's always going to be a loser in every match yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because recently you chose really tough opponents and it was, you know, like the highest, like the top level athletes. And I mean, before Jordan, like a year ago, you smashed Krasimir because you flashed pin as far as I remember, like three times him.
SPEAKER_00: so actually i didn't expect such a result with jordan but maybe maybe his hand is completely different for you than krasimir's hand because i always thought like that jordan and krasimir are almost on the same level i mean so yeah no your jordan is taller and has longer longer reach it can come to your size a little bit more and you know it can just
SPEAKER_02: like go around well while grassy is not that tall and his reach is a little bit shorter and his wrist is strong but he does a lot of things with his wrist and supination while i think that jordan comes a little bit slides around around your arm i don't know different leverage yeah matt would would know the difference definitely that levers the length of the arm
SPEAKER_03: especially if you're coming back allows you to compensate more for that person going backwards because you're able to cover more real estate because your arm is longer right definitely makes a huge difference i felt i felt that jordan was stronger than when i had pulled krazy flights could have made a difference on krazy's end as well too right like uh coming in just
SPEAKER_03: it he might have been able to recoup off of off of the jet lag or whatever but jordan definitely did feel more stronger more powerful than when it was when i had felt crazy so but it's uh yeah it is what it is right it's a matter of just going back and drawing board that's kind of why i'm going
SPEAKER_03: taking this rope that i'm going to take now to get back into the east versus west just kind of start right back at the basics and i feel if i make a few little mistakes along the way i still have time to prepare repair it and you know what i mean kind of fine tweak before i get back to that top top level so hopefully
SPEAKER_02: after after your experience with krasimir with the dominance against a guy with similar style do you think that you you're a little overconfident because of your effectiveness against uh hopefully it definitely did play a role but i think also i don't think
SPEAKER_03: My confidence had a huge part, just because the ups and the downs that I have had, I wasn't really taking Jordan lightly. I really did deep down thought that it was going to be a very similar match with the match that I did have with Krazy. But, you know... What did you learn, Matt? What did you learn? I found the biggest thing, and it was...
SPEAKER_03: was what's his name that pointed out to me uh uh troy eaton i'm sure you know troy eaton you know yes yes yeah yeah i've been pulling been pulling the same amount of time if not longer than you right so but he's uh very very competitive he's all about like uh fine tweaks everything in the sport understands how the draw sheet works like he's a very very technical arm wrestler
SPEAKER_03: uh very big on where it comes to mental preparation everything else leading up to it and i was just shooting the with him after the match and i was like man like seems like something's going like i never used to get caught into a hook before like i it never used to happen my explosivity was a lot more there i was never the second one out of the gate i was always the first one on the gate and i mentioned i'm like like what the hell is going on they're saying go and all of a sudden i'm inside a hook and i'm like
SPEAKER_03: It just like, I've never really been caught there so many times as I have been recently. And he actually pointed out, he's like, well, how are you training? Are you training your hits and stuff? So I go through motions and stuff. He says, well, no, when you go up to the table, it says, and you grab on with your guys and you guys go to start going, do you go through your emotion? Are you catching all the time?
SPEAKER_03: And I says, wow, like a lot stronger than everybody I'm training with. So I'm majority of my matches, I'm catching, I'm catching all my matches. And then I slowly work my way back and it's like, that's your fucking problem. I says, well, how do you figure it? He says, cause you accustomed, you've created that muscle memory to every time you get up to the table, 99.9% of the time I get up to the table.
SPEAKER_03: I started to a negative position before I started to work my way back and it's become more comfortable for me to do so. The only time I'm actually really going off the goal when it hits is in tournament time or competition time, which is once every four months or six months or whatever it works out to be.
SPEAKER_03: So I was like, you know, that actually kind of makes sense. First practice I had when I came back, I went to the table and I just went through my motion first. And he said, you know, it's not about smashing everybody in your practices to the pad. It's just about going through your movement first and then letting them get everything and then slowly working for it back. And I noticed as soon as I stepped up to the table, I did it. And the first five, six times I went to go through my motion, it was awkward as fuck.
SPEAKER_03: like it literally fell i was like holy it was like trying to ride a bike all over again so i've been really concentrating on that in the last last couple weeks ever since i pulled the order or whatever is just getting used to being able to initiate my goals getting used to do be the first movement going through my emotions as opposed to catching and trying to work my way back from there and i think he nailed it on the head it could be something small little fine tweak like that to help adjust it
SPEAKER_03: But I really do believe that majority of my matches, if you look at it, I'm hitting the goal one out of five, six times, but it's not banged into my position. Like it's almost I'm there and then I'm trying to fight for it afterwards, right? So. Do you think it was like a thing about like pronators, a little bit more pronators, stronger pronator in a defensive way as a defensive block whenever he hit to not to turn because you use your pronator
SPEAKER_02: mostly as offensive right with the goal to take it take the hand you know not like you know like a block that somebody can press press but you still remain you know and i will tell you something jordan around that weight class maybe with maybe the best guy about hook inability with someone like matushenko around that way i'm not saying the best hook
SPEAKER_02: He may be one of them, but hook inability, Ivan Matushenko, Jordan Sonev, those guys' hands and the quickness and the control of the hands and supination and a little bit forward moving and going around your arm, just like incredible. Real good finesse, right? Like there's no flaws to his initiation into set and hook.
SPEAKER_03: Like, he doesn't have a lot of flaws, right? And that's the thing. I actually feel I am faster than him. It's just, it wasn't, I wasn't hitting it. I wasn't getting them, right? So it's, and it's a trial, right? It's,
SPEAKER_03: I could be wrong with this. I could be right with my theory of where I think I'm messing up. But it's, you know, the only way is to dissect it, hit it, go at it dead on and kind of adjust from there, right? I will ask you one question shortly. What was his weight? He looked really big. I never seen him that big. Yeah, he was, what the heck was he? Two, I think he was close to 260. Are you joking? No, he was 255, 260.
SPEAKER_02: are you serious yeah oh okay that explains a lot of things because this guy was pulling 220 and even in moldo events in 2018 he was 209. so 220 and you're saying that around 250 even if it's 250
SPEAKER_03: Oh, that is different than yours. He's definitely been eating better. He's definitely carrying a little more around his midsection than he did. But he's also thicker in other areas. I've seen Jorn before. I've never gripped up with him on the table, but you can tell his hand is definitely thicker. His arms are a little thicker. He's got a little more. He's got an extra foot from one last notch on the belt.
SPEAKER_02: or two but it's but he's definitely definitely that's not the Jordan we know for sure that's not no he's definitely he's definitely leveled up yeah yeah yeah yeah because I told him he was big that's why I was kidding we couldn't talk with you do you want to have anything to say about this subject or do you have any question that you prefer to ask uh our superstar Matt
SPEAKER_01: Yes, sir. I want to ask that, uh, who, who he liked to face next, or he wants to face somebody.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I got a match right now with Kilachinko in August. Right now, I honestly, I don't have anybody in my sights. There's nobody I really want to pull right now. There's obviously a few matches I'd like to have back. I'd love to obviously pull, what's his face again? Holy fuck, brain fart right now. My big brother just beat him up for me.
SPEAKER_03: not not your word in um east versus west
SPEAKER_03: Sandrys? Yeah, obviously I'd love to have a match with Sandrys again. Jordan, I'd love to pull again. I just feel once I get my shit back on track. But as for who I want to pull next, I'm more so just right now I'm just trying to battle the demons I believe that I have with myself on the table. I want to get myself back to where I feel I should be.
SPEAKER_03: and then from there it's just kind of i just kind of want to get like not not don't really care who the hell it is it's more just getting myself back on par getting back up to that elite level back in east versus west and all those other super matches where i feel i belong and from there it's pretty much whoever's standing in front of me or whoever's next or whoever promoters want to want me to pull i really really don't care i really don't care are you going to compete the qualification is first request
SPEAKER_03: yeah i'm gonna go i'm going to toronto april 8th um that's that's kind of going to be my little uh just to kind of figure out exactly how my process is going over the next couple months because i don't want to be take six months off and just concentrate on training something and then hit an elite person again and realize
SPEAKER_03: I've been fucking training wrong the whole fucking time. So this is kind of going to be a little bit of a training tool for me. I've been working on some things, feeling to get my goals and my hits back. So I'm going to hit this tournament April 8th in Toronto at that Jason Constantine spot. I think it's going to be a sick event. So we're attending that. I'm going to hit that one and I can use that as...
SPEAKER_03: how did i do if i make a mistake i still feel there's a chance where i can catch the person i can still recover from there but at least i'm going to be like okay i kind of missed that goal i mean fine tweak this a little bit more a little fine tweak that and then i'll have two months to prepare after that before finals in virginia and then from there i can find tweak it again before i have to match against kilachanko and i'm competing hopefully you choose another and others
SPEAKER_02: very tough opponent with Kalinyshenko. Very tough one. Yeah. Yeah. But different style than what I've been following lately, right? Beating Kalinyshenko will prove a lot of things if you can. Seriously. Like, Kalinyshenko, you saw with him, with Deserano, he was beating him 2-0. Deserano is really, really, like, elite level cooler. Like, many times, World Champion. And Musahid,
SPEAKER_02: I read on the chat that you are a national champion. Is that true in Pakistan? No, no, sir. No, you're not. Okay. Somebody wrote here. So probably they were just pulling around, you know, you, but you are an armistice. You pulling. Yes. Yes, sir. Yes. Five years. Five years. Yeah. Did you, did you win any medal in any local event or something?
SPEAKER_02: Most of the time I won super matches, but in the tournament I lose. I somehow managed to win. That's good. That's good. Matt, this is our new format. We are with the fans together. So these guys and you guys can be, you know, close to each other. That is our new format. So they really like to be together with the superstars as yourself.
SPEAKER_03: yeah it's a pleasure i i still don't believe that i can i can freely talk with you yeah it's it's fine man i'm just a regular dude just like you guys i love the sport what i started to right so yeah yeah yeah not nothing to nothing to you know things like big you know
SPEAKER_00: Okay, Iwan, how about yourself? You're just a fan or you're also an athlete? No, I'm a professional arm wrestler. I was second on Polish national. In a month, we have another Polish national championship. And if I will be able to win or at least become second, so I will start looking for an opportunity to maybe East vs West qualification. Oh, you're going to go Riga?
SPEAKER_00: are you planning to go rica or maybe maybe but i will see i will see how my shape looks like in our national uh competition in a month and you know i will know if it force or i still need to to work more on my shape i understand i understand my friend and you you want you have any question for
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, actually, Matt, I have a few questions. So first question, maybe because I saw a quite interesting video. I mean, after your match with Jordan, Devon pulled Jordan and actually Devon folded him quite easily.
SPEAKER_00: nevertheless after that you also pulled devon and devon really struggled with you so it means that you know how to arm wrestle devon or uh or or how can you explain that or it was just i think it's a combination
SPEAKER_03: of a couple different factors. Me and Devin have been pulling each other for many, many, many years. I do believe the angle that I do attack
SPEAKER_03: is a little bit of a soft spot for devon but it's it's also i don't think my power level isn't there with these guys like i was saying i think it's like i was even confused i was talking with them and after like what the is going on he's like dude it's something small and something simple and something
SPEAKER_03: little that you're missing that you weren't that you're doing now that you weren't doing before so it's i think i think my power level is fairly close to where it should be or it is where it should be it's just a matter of me getting my hits and my goals and everything else so
SPEAKER_03: so in two words only some technical adjustments and after that you think that you will be able to i mean to compete with jordan for example on the same level i i i don't think it's um i i think it's just small little tweaks it's something very very little because even afterwards me and jordan we gripped up with each other and he wasn't dominating me like he was super
SPEAKER_03: match, I was able to get the hang control I wanted, take the post to the pin, I was holding him down. It wasn't complete domination by him in any means whatsoever. It was a full struggle the whole way. I do believe it's very similar, something small. Same with Sandry's. When I gripped up with him after a match to this one at field, there's no way you should have done that to me. It was the same scenario. He wasn't going through me in
SPEAKER_03: any weight whatsoever and after pulling is completely different but you can still kind of gauge a little bit of the strength level you just don't have that explosiveness the goals the hits and everything like you do when when you're actually competing right so understand and matt while you are preparing to your super match so do you prefer to work with weights or do you prefer table time like that one does
SPEAKER_03: I like both. I'm a firm believer that table time is key. So I concentrate on table time as number one and that I use my weights for what I feel I've lacked or what I may need in between to be able to compensate for it. So if I have 25 guys show up to practice, my arms would be
SPEAKER_03: to the next day when i go to do my weights and i pick them up i'll grab them safety 60 pounders i go to lift them once or twice they feel a little sore my muscles i'll put them down i'll grab 20 pounders i'll do more sets lighter weight just to get that blood flow help with recovery
SPEAKER_03: If I have, say, only six or seven guys show up to practice and I didn't get a really good workout, then the next day I'll use the weights to compensate for that workout that I didn't get. So I'll grab heavier weights and I'll just lift them heavier. So for myself, I try to keep
SPEAKER_03: Keep my body more around that 70% range when I'm training. All the time, I try not to dip too much below, and I find if I dip too much below, I'm injuring myself. If I'm hovering too much above it, I'm not getting a good enough workout. So I try to keep myself around that 70%, whether it's, you know, blood flow recovery between with weights or heavier weights to try to keep myself more beat down. So it's more, it's always about table time for me, and then weights are just the filler in between.
SPEAKER_01: My friend, just tell us about your favorite arm wrestler. My favorite arm wrestler is Dennis Saplenko. Dennis Saplenko. Why do you like him so much? Because when I was not an arm wrestler, I have a Facebook account and I used to watch Dennis Saplenko. Can you talk a little bit louder? I can't hear you. Can I hear you? Now you hear me? Yeah, just hear.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So I was having a Facebook account, uh, so long ago. And, uh, when I was not an arm wrestler, but I used to see Dennis Saplenko's videos and, uh, I see his more and more videos and got involved into arm wrestling just because I love his pulling style. You know, he's, he came back from very, very, uh, positions, like very, especially if you see his matches with Pushkar.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah i was coming through here and then recovering from there yeah yeah so i got more interested in arm wrestling and started with my friends and uh so that's it so from there i used to get anderson and you have another question for matt uh he table practice he was talking about table practice that
SPEAKER_01: He prefers more table time. So I want to ask him that, uh, he did it on a weekly basis or if he needs more rest or, uh, what he, he does long because of when we do table practice, uh, weekly, then sometimes we another week when it's next week, we feel pain in our arms. So how he recovers.
SPEAKER_03: basically yeah so that's you can't compare devin to everybody else a lot of people aren't going to train six days a week like devin does don't don't do it like
SPEAKER_03: said nobody nobody but devin can do what devin does with the amount of training that he actually does like every one of us other arm wrestlers even on that top level we're all human and that pain that you get if we train too much we feel that pain too so the biggest thing i find with
SPEAKER_03: With me being able to do as much table time as I possibly can is over those years, every time you get that muscle pain and stuff like that, it's about knowing your limits. Everybody has limits, obviously, except for Devin.
SPEAKER_03: But there's certain limits where you'll know when you train a little too hard, the next time you go to grip up, if you lift any weights, you get that too big pain, that pain in your bone kind of deal. You've went a little too hard in practice before. So you almost want to tickle that edge every time, but you don't want to exceed it because if you exceed it, you're going to get the muscle pain, the bone aches and everything else that you did from the week prior, right? So it's more about learning
SPEAKER_03: I believe what you can handle, there'll be some practices where I'll go on where I'm feeling good and I can train for fucking two hours straight, no problem. The next day I don't have any aches and pains and I can go ahead and train again. And then there's some practices where I'll go on and I'll start to feel my muscles acting in a way that they did when I start to get that pain.
SPEAKER_03: and i'll be like okay i think the rest of practice i'm not going to continue to push this hard i'm just going to go through more emotions get some blood flow stuff like that so it's every time you get to the table it's not about having to put 100 effort into every single match and every time you get to the table sometimes just going through emotions with 50 60 effort is what you need right so
SPEAKER_03: I think it's just trying to go too hard all the time will give you that pain. But you can train every single day. It's just a matter of not pushing too hard over that limit, right? And the more you do it, the more you're going to be able to withhold, right? It's also about, like, you need to get to know yourself. Like, do not just listen from other people and do the exact thing that you hear. You need to know yourself.
SPEAKER_02: And you need to know yourself. You may be built different than others, as Devon is. And also, like, there is nothing like, as he said, like, there is nothing like training. It's like, but there are different type of trainings.
SPEAKER_02: But there are different types of things to consider. How much you're forcing, what you are training, is it dynamic training or static training? Whatever, you know, just basically you need to listen to your body and make decisions. You can't go that, you know, you cannot have a mindset that I will do this.
SPEAKER_02: And after this training, before you do, you cannot say that you will rest this much and then I will do this next, I will do this next. You need to really do it and then decide what we need to do. And you'll never know what's too much.
SPEAKER_03: until you've at least done it too much a couple times right you know what i mean like you'll never know okay this is where my limit is and unless you've actually succeeded it and gone past that limit to where you hurt yourself you don't really know what that looks so you kind of almost have to go past a little bit sometimes you know you'll be you'll just tickle it for six months and then i
SPEAKER_02: that kind of fucking set me back for a week, you know what I mean? So then you really got to bring it back with more one-flow work for a week or two, and then you can slowly start pushing and tickling it again, right? So... Yeah, there is a few superstars. Kirsten, your friend, prodigy. Kirsten, great podcast, like always. Matt, sunny days are coming, buddy. Everyone will have his ups and downs. Keep at it and ignore people who tell you to quit.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you, my friend. And one more I saw down here somewhere. Again, Sean, thank you, my friends. There is some interference or background noise coming from you. Sound coming from you. I think you're holding all the time the microphone. It makes all the time. Just try not to play with microphone that often. Yeah, it's OK. Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: Can he get muted when not talking, please? Maybe he can try to be black in his microphone. Maybe, maybe, maybe you mute your microphone when you are not talking and then you, yeah, turn on, yeah, because the sound coming all the time, yeah. Yeah, you cost, Sean, $6.99 Canadian dollar to say this.
SPEAKER_02: yeah and anyway so uh matt have you seen the cards the the upcoming east versus west yeah i've seen some of the matches that that you got going on so i think it's going to be pretty interesting yeah yeah and are there anyone that you emmy are there anyone that you are like i'm sure that you are very interested in uh devon
SPEAKER_02: i think it's devon versus gennady but we have some other matches as well by the way you want you follow east versus west my friends yes sure all the time yeah you enjoy it yeah yeah i enjoy it every time i buy pay-per-view and we are watching and we have like sparring session with our friends and together at the same time right yeah yeah that's good and mushaid you you ever watched east versus west yes
SPEAKER_02: you like it yes you like it very much yeah yeah thank you and let's let's talk about some of these matches and okay math rob versus drop what's that sorry rob visions versus drop table
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's going to be interesting. But it's just interesting to see where Vincent's going to be at, right? Because last time he competed was against Sasho, which was at Armoires, was what, a year and a half ago, two years ago, something like that? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: yeah so it's it's i know he's obviously been training it looks like he's been training he's always got that same bulge and bicep massive hands uh very difficult to deal with if you haven't really pulled with a big hand before so it's i i'm going to see exactly what kind of shape rbg is in after being off for as long as he has been
SPEAKER_03: So that's going to be the telltale. If RBJ is on, that motherfucker is on. If he gets into his head or starts to get into a little bit of a slouch, he starts to go downhill pretty quick. But if he's on, it's like he puts on a hell of a show. Yeah. Do you think that the American team around him will motivate him? Because he will have some guys that he has
SPEAKER_02: been friends for many years and now they are at the same team, traveling overseas, like Pauline, Pauline, like Douglas, like Dave Chaffee, and there will be Adam, there will be Cody Merritt, there will be Devon there. And like, do you think that his psychology will be better?
SPEAKER_03: then i don't know if it'll be any better because like all those people that you've listed we've we've all competed at tournaments and hung out and matches like after matches before matches at wl events and everything together as well in the past so so i don't know if
SPEAKER_03: it's gonna really help him i don't think it's gonna hurt him in any way i think uh i think maybe long travel because he's not really used to competing any more any further than three or four hours from his own house that may have an effect on him he's arriving four days before i think he will get
SPEAKER_02: used to with that'll give him enough time yeah i think i think tuesday as far as i remember he's i think arriving on tuesday but we will see maybe i misremember first but you are saying that it's a close match i think it could be interesting yeah yeah and it all depends on
SPEAKER_03: like I said, where RBJ actually is. So I know just if you take so much time off, you're not hitting them tournaments, you're not getting them goals or see if you haven't been training the exact same. Like a lot of shit can play into factor, right? As opposed to somebody that's a little more used to actually being a little more competitive like RBJ. We don't know. RBJ has been stuck in a box for the last two years. We don't know.
SPEAKER_00: where he's at, right? Yeah, I understand, I understand. And Ivan, how do you see this? Yeah, actually, as Matt said, everything depends on how good is RVG right now. Nevertheless, I see like great improvement from Zurab, because as far as I remember, I mean, when he competed in WAF,
SPEAKER_00: He used to lose his wrist often. But now I see like his last super matches, it seems that he straightened his wrist. And I think that Rob probably will not be able to take his wrist. And I think that if he will not take his wrist, so Zurab will win it easily. And I will ask Matt. Prokopchik versus Doug, Eric.
SPEAKER_03: That's going to be a tough one for my man Dougie, that's for sure. But Dougie definitely has, I think he has more leverage advantage. Doug's another thing where he hasn't really been active in the sport except for, you know, a month and a half, two months leading up to his match against Coach Ray. So it's really hard to say. I don't
SPEAKER_03: i don't think coach ray would have given would have given him much more of a goal so it's it's it's a tough one like porch i'm gonna butcher his name but uh for porch how do you say his name
SPEAKER_03: like he's got he is impressive he's such a small little dude but that lock that that kid has in his arm still joins
SPEAKER_03: Yes, that's what I mean. Like Dougie, I believe, is going to get him into some dangerous waters. But unless Doug's able to finish him quick, we're really going to see what kind of stamina Doug has. Because like that lock that he has when he gets close to that pin pad rate, about that 90 degree mark, it's something fierce to be able to break through, right? So I think Doug's really, I'm cheering for Doug on this one.
SPEAKER_03: But I think Doug's really going to have to dig deep on this one. And he ain't going to want to showboat. If he feels comfortable, he doesn't want to. He just wants to get them over with. Because round three, round four, that's where it's really going to matter, right? Yes, yes, yes. Mishai, how do you see that match? Do you know both athletes? I know Daniel Prokopchuk. I know him. What is his name? You don't know Doug Ehrlich?
SPEAKER_02: How do you pronounce his name, Matt? El Rich. El Rich, yeah. You don't know, okay. I will ask you another match that you know, because we only know Prokofiev. It's impossible to compare, you know, if you don't know the other guy. I ask you, Ivan, how do you see it? Yeah, but you know, actually, I tried to look for some matches with Doug El Rich, or how he knows El Rich, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: i saw some matches but to be honest i cannot imagine right now i mean in my in my mind the way how he can win against daniel because daniel i mean he has everything his stamina is wonderful his power if is also awesome so we will see but but i really hope that he will be able i mean to to show something against daniel i understand i understand
SPEAKER_02: Okay, let's go with Cody Merritt versus Alysanne Murado. You know the Kazakh guy? Did you see him in last event? I don't know much about him. I know Cody. This guy, this guy, this guy played 209 and won the Waffles in super heavyweights. He competed super heavyweight and he won. Except one match, he really dominated everyone. And he just came to East versus West and he beat Oleg Petrenko.
SPEAKER_02: three zero and Oleg Petrenko four years ago at that time it was three years ago uh a little bit more than three three years and two months or something he beat David Dadik and it's a lot of truth at 209. okay yeah yeah I don't know I know who you're talking about now yeah yeah and but this guy this guy Alijan Kazakh guy beats Oleg Petrenko is the one that faced John Brzee one event before one event before Iraq yeah
SPEAKER_02: And Alijan beat him as well. And he's going to face now Cody Merritt. And Cody Merritt is probably, we can say comfortably, that's like in top three in U.S. with left arm. I mean, not U.S., only maybe North America. Yeah, there's not many. I don't think there's many people that can touch Cody in North America with the left arm. So in that super heavyweight division, Cody's proving himself time and time and time over again, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you don't know the other guy well enough?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know him super well, but like I seen his mask with Oleg and he's, he's a dangerous dude, like very, very dangerous dude. Do you remember the match? Cody, Cody's such a massive man and Cody knows how to arm wrestle too, right? Cody's probably going in there with 180 pounds on this kid. So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Probably. Probably. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: but but again this guy competed love world super heavyweight and he won there oh yes yeah you know i have seen this guy winning a russian event where morozov i think could make top three probably or maybe morozov was i'm talking about left arm about probably one and a half year ago so this guy is light but he's incredibly strong guy and mushai do you know these guys alijan and
SPEAKER_01: Yes, Cody. I think Arijan has more chances to win because he is very explosive. And as he shows his performance in last WAF event, as he dominated super heavyweights. So I think more chances to him. But Cody is also strong and he is also heavy. But let's see.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's more for Alijan Muratov. Alijan Muratov, slightly favorite, but both are dangerous guys. That's what you're saying. Yeah, before I missed, there was a super chat. I think maybe even two. Logan Mistyaki. Ask the whole panel their top three arm masters all time. My top three all time are John Bersink, Denis Plankov, and Levan.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you for your support. Who are your top three arm wrestlers of all time? When you say the top three, you mean the top three strongest? Probably that. All our super heavyweights and successful guys. But who are your top three arm wrestlers of all time, Matt?
SPEAKER_03: Uh, mine, mine, I'm, I'm old school. So, so for me, it's, it's always been for zinc, Ron bath and Devin, right? Like that's, that's who inspired me the most for zinc has been asked his ability to build, to pull in any angle on the table, his ability to talk role, uh, Ron bath, just as raw group fucking strength. Never, never given up. Doesn't matter what position he's on the table and Devin, because he's Devin.
SPEAKER_03: right you know what i mean we're we're we're good buddies we're we're friends we've you know we got that uh that friendship plus the inspiration and how he's inspired me over the years right to continue to push so yeah much much more than much more to say about him than than french reporters and yeah and and yours ivan
SPEAKER_00: I mean, first and second place, it is for sure John Zhang, probably it is first place. Second place, it is Devon Larratt. And for third place, it is really difficult to put, I mean, somebody for me.
SPEAKER_00: because you know i can i can also put you because uh you you were able to to win a lot of wav titles yeah with your weight you were able to compete with stronger and bigger guys so it means a lot and i also really like your technique how you perform thank you thank you so you guys are actually saying your favorite arm masters not the strongest top three but and you much right
SPEAKER_02: yes sir uh first dennis secondly alexis and third is one second okay all three eastern guys you are you are fan of uh eastern guys you are you are you are a hardcore team east fan as far as i understand
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And so thank you for your support, my friend. Thank you for your support. And let's go to the next one. Adam Wojcicki, Bacho Saganashvili, Matt. This Bacho guy, I saw him when he was like 14 or 15 years old. He was pulling top junior category at the WAP World. And he won under 15 years old. After that,
SPEAKER_02: Because of pandemic and some problems between Georgian Federation and World Federation, these guys never had opportunity to pull anywhere. But now, Levan, Gennady, all Georgians, they are talking so highly. The guy is either 18 or 19 years old, most likely 18 years old. And they say even in hook, he is 50-50 with Zurab. And with outside, maybe slightly better than Zurab, they say. And they say...
SPEAKER_02: I'm afraid I didn't ask if I would say, can he beat John? I'm afraid that they will say yes, he would beat him too. But they didn't say so. They're a little biased in Georgia, eh? Yes, yes, they are, they are. But it kind of excites me, you understand? Because we used to be young and we need new guys. That's also the reason Adam may not be as young as
SPEAKER_02: But Adam is also a new hope. You know, I saw the potential. Whenever I set the match, most of the people said, oh, what are you doing? Bozidar is going to kill him, not feel him, this and this. And I said, let's see, you know. And then we saw that he was stronger. So how do you see this match? How do you think it's possible anyone 18 years old just come outside of Georgia and then suddenly beat a world-class fuller?
SPEAKER_03: I don't, I don't think it's going to happen like that. Uh, anything's possible. I believe with the sport, like, especially what we've seen in the last couple of years. Um, but, uh, but yeah, obviously, obviously my favorite would be, would be Adam going into that match. Right. So, yeah, but even, even if Macho gives him a good match, still, I will be impressed.
SPEAKER_02: Like that young man. That's just, that's just me. Like he's still a puppy, right? Like 18 years old. You don't even know yet, right? Like he's just working on a fucking shave. Like he's, yeah. Yeah. I would set Adam, like, like I want Adam to go, you know, like I want, I want him to like, very soon, if he passes this one, I want to set Adam with someone
SPEAKER_02: very very high level very high level maybe not a title match but something like close to them yeah something like europe someone like yeah yeah yeah anyway so and ivan
SPEAKER_00: you know actually for me it is pretty interesting because uh i've seen recently some videos with bacho how he waited like really huge weights and i mean i and you know like georgian school of arm wrestling is really good
SPEAKER_00: Like we have Irakli as an example because he was like 18 and 20 years old and he won everything. So it means nothing that Bacho is young, that he's 19 years old. But I think that he will have a lot. Did you say he was 18 and 20 and he won everything you said?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, because when Irakli was 19 and 20, he was already competing on WAF and he won a lot of medals. I mean, gold medals. Yeah, I mean, no, no, he never won WAF. You're talking about juniors. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Juniors is different. This guy is also junior champion. But I think he didn't win any WAF. Irakli didn't win any WAF. Yeah. I think he took second to Talgat.
SPEAKER_00: yeah but but you know um what what is in my mind uh the match when iraqli was able to win makarov when makarov was really dominant on everyone and iraqli was able to win him yeah yeah because once you top roll makarov you cannot resist super you know but
SPEAKER_02: Even your top will tell that he's still pushed his shoulder and he can still go that way. But yeah, as you said, if I'll got them, my car would meet my car would be told us. And, and I'll that be directly and directly with my car. This is the beauty of arm wrestling, you know, the, the, but I don't see all got meeting my car inside because he doesn't have any ability to go outside.
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so and how do you see this match? You know, I think that it will be like a good fight. Nevertheless, Adam Wawrzynski is a real deal and it can be a lot. I mean, for the first match for Bacho. Nevertheless, we will see. We will see what happens. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And another good one, Matt. Pauline versus Sasho. That's going to be interesting.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's interesting. Paul Lynn's obviously showing that he's the man who deserves to be where he's at. Sashel, that's another dude that in that 200-pound weight category was right up there with being the best of the best, right? So I honestly think this is probably by far going to be Paul Lynn's toughest challenge yet.
SPEAKER_02: So, and Sasho, like Sasho hasn't really, besides when he pulled RBG, he hasn't really been active, I don't think, since then, has he? He pulled Waf, Waf Wars, and he won. Oh, he did? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. In 2021, I think his right side was injured. I think he skipped that one. Claremont won over Zolaire. In 2022, he won in Antalya, Waf Wars. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: but yeah i think it's i think it's definitely definitely going to be paul's
SPEAKER_03: Paul's toughest challenge. Obviously, I want to see Paul win. Paul's been on a fucking crazy streak. I'd love to see him keep that streak going, right? But it's Sasho. Sasho's a bad fucking dude. He is a bad, bad dude. Like, I can honestly see Sasho coming in and there's not a person with a 200-pound class that's going to be able to do anything with him. So...
SPEAKER_03: Like, I can see him going right to the freaking top and staying there for a very long time. So... Yeah, like, I learned one thing after all those matches that you shouldn't underestimate Paul. I'm not talking to you, but anyone. Like, Paul is very... Oh, I'm not underestimating Paul in any means whatsoever, but I'm just going off of...
SPEAKER_03: sasho's track record in the past and where he where the level that i believe he was at and and i think paul is very very close to that level i don't know if he's there yet but this is paul is great great in there so and i i really do think if sasho comes in 100 healthy this will be paul's toughest challenge and if paul can if paul pulls this off well then i just
SPEAKER_03: That just goes against anybody. Nobody can say shit about Paul. You know what I mean? Or all of all was his base wasn't fully trained or anything else. It's like all that motherfucker deserves to be holding that helmet and wearing that fucking shield, right? So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and we tried. Yes, sir. I'm angry with Matt Mask as he said that it's a very tough match and.
SPEAKER_01: Sasha has also a good record in the past. And Pauline is also dominating in East versus West. So yes, it's very hard to predict. Yes. But it will be a war. Yeah, I believe so. I believe so. Pauline is a mentally very strong guy.
SPEAKER_02: he is one of those a few guys that you would say a true professional he started arm wrestling very late but his professionalism is inspiring me inspiring me the way he prepares the way he takes seriously the things like like mental strength everything the guy is just like like
SPEAKER_02: I can say that. He's one of my favorite arm wrestlers. Don't get me wrong. I'm an organizer. I really don't care who wins after this. The match is fair and square. But that guy, he deserves to be respected. Not only his results, but the way that he prepares himself. The guy is incredible. And Brandon versus Samusha. Who, sorry?
SPEAKER_03: brandon as sessor versus samusha david oh yeah that's that's gonna be a tough one brandon's been he's been killing it lately too right so i think he's he's definitely he's definitely definitely i believe earned his right to be representing the west at the east west over his performance even i even think he was probably a year ago
SPEAKER_03: People should have been picking him for these big, big matches because he's been proving himself over and over and over again. And it's full time, like that you're, that you're able to, and people are actually starting to recognize him as one of the better arm wrestlers in North America, even though he's been ranked as one of the better arm wrestlers in North America for
SPEAKER_03: quite a while they've kind of been pushing underneath the radar but he's he's a bad dude man he's he's showing that he can pull anywhere on the table even when he gets his hand bent back he still hangs in he's able to get his head back to where he needs to
SPEAKER_03: can pull into a press he can pull in a top roll he's he's someone that just doesn't give up right the the heart and everything else that he brings to the table is uh is is is what you want right like it's really you want that amount of determination and ability to not give up during a match so how he's going to pull against the beach
SPEAKER_03: I don't know it's different right because it's that's the thing he's Brandon I don't think has ever traveled outside of North America to compete before you know it's it's different going over to pull these Europeans and us North American pullers
SPEAKER_03: it's a different breed pulling some of them eastern pullers that you know especially if Brandon goes inside with some of these guys like it's they're like the inside power that the western pullers or the eastern pullers have I believe is definitely stronger than the majority of our western pullers
SPEAKER_03: So, all right, except for the odd exception with Hutchins and stuff like that, I do believe that the Eastern Polars do have a lot more connectivity inside stronger elbows than we have here in the West, right? Do you believe that to progress to the next levels, these kind of events is the event to, like,
SPEAKER_03: process that the next level. Brandon can compete in North America as much as he wants for the next five years, but I don't think unless he actually does a couple of rounds over at East versus West, he's not going to hit
SPEAKER_03: that full potential he needs to be pulling some of the more eastern eastern pullers as opposed to the western pullers because it's it's a different it's a different breed right like different breed different styles so it's yeah i i don't think he's gonna be able to get to that top level unless he actually tests himself at that level
SPEAKER_03: and it actually seems like the more he tests himself the more he's able to progress to that level yes yes yes yes you you are not gonna like overnight you know come to the next level if you never be part of that that competition level you will never you will never and chances are you're probably gonna fail at that level once or twice unless you're all in where you come in right out of the gate and be like i'm the man you know you're
SPEAKER_03: you're probably going to go to that level or compete at that top level and fail a little bit. If anything, you're going to be walking away better than you were before you went into it, right?
SPEAKER_03: And I think this is going to be a real good push, a real good motivation drive for Brandon. And the amount of motivation and push and everything else that he's had just on his own, just in North America wanting to compete here, that it's, yeah, pretty much like he has pretty much the same amount of dedication that Paul Lynn has. The amount of training that he's doing, the amount he's pushing.
SPEAKER_03: that guy does not give a when anybody says the next day he's in the gym pushing it just as hard as he was the week before right yes yes i have been following him almost for three years the big guy i mean he has his own dreams he doesn't stop he doesn't give a yeah
SPEAKER_02: And I'm not dumb in what I believe. All you motherfuckers over here are wrong for not believing him. That's why, you know, I thought, okay, it's time for this guy. That is why. And now he has the world title match. In fact, I offer him a 95 kilo category match, but it wouldn't be a world title match. But he choose to have the world title match.
SPEAKER_02: So, yeah, because better motivation, you know, better motivation. A harder one, harder goal, but a better motivation. He didn't want to have an easier start.
SPEAKER_03: you got to have respect for a guy that has that much, that much belief and determination in himself. And then not only just the belief and determination, you can see that he's putting in the work with the posts and everything he's making, but he's actually backing that shit up. Like every single time he goes to pull somebody, he's
SPEAKER_03: He's pretty much shocking the world and beating them when people think he didn't have a chance, right? Like, even no fucking Travis Bajan was all washed up. Like, you got to fucking win in the left arm on fucking Travis Bajan.
SPEAKER_03: know what i mean i thought i thought he was going to struggle a lot more with craig tooley i really thought craig was gonna was probably going to go yeah yeah brandon which was was horrible for craig three weeks before he goes to pull east versus west ends up having to pull brennan house ouster and brandon gives him the match in his life
SPEAKER_03: you know so but yeah that guy definitely deserves to be at east versus west so i'm excited to see how he performs there too myself so yeah and and ewan
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, actually, to be honest, I'm not really acquainted with Brandon. Nevertheless, I've seen a lot of matches of David Samusha. I remember his impressive performance on Zloty Tur when he was able to take a medal in the Open Absolute Class.
SPEAKER_00: And I think it will be tough challenge for both opponents, because as you described, I mean, opponent of David. So now I think that it is good opponent for David Samusha. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go to the next one. Arif Ertam versus Georgi Dzeranov. Who is Arif Ertam?
SPEAKER_02: Arif Ertem versus Georgi Dzeranov. Georgi is the one that pulled Bortolatov and Kalinyshenko and beat both of them 3-2. Oh, okay. Georgi. You remember the Kazakh guy? Yeah, Georgi. Kalinyshenko was beating him 2-0. He came back and beat him. Yeah. And the other guy is, you know, Arif Ertem. Yeah, I know Arif. That's...
SPEAKER_03: dominant in this last fucking match against Cody too, right? So yeah.
SPEAKER_03: like was very impressive, very impressive. So, but Georgie, fuck Georgie. Georgie's a bad dude. I really like Georgie. I got to hang out with Georgie a shit ton after the event. Me, Artem, Georgie, and then my boys that I went with fucking all got to hang out. So Georgie, he is becoming one of my favorite arm wrestlers out there right now. Even though he lost his matches, he's really starting to, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Matt, Matt, do you realize that each East versus West is not only East versus West, but also a bridge between East and West that people are really getting to know each other and becoming friends, you know, it's like, as you said, you know, like you, you had, because I can probably translate it for you. What was, what you were saying? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: yeah so yeah and it's great because we know we've already have one thing in common right you know what i mean one thing in common that one of the biggest passions you know what i mean in our lives so it's it's it's definitely not hard it's great to actually
SPEAKER_03: you know interact with other other athletes that are on the same level that have the same amount of passion as you you made it it may be hard to have conversations with each other like we sat there for about four or five hours having conversations with each other using google translate right he'd say something at google i'd be like what's like you're talking oh okay hang on he'd see it and then i'd read it oh okay and then i'd see my story and then five minutes later he'd be able to read it then he'd start laughing right so yeah yeah but
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. And how do you see this match? Who's winning here? I really don't know. I... Arif, I like Arif. He's... I love the style. I'm a top roller. I got a... I love the fucking top rollers. Georgie... Georgie's got a massive, massive hand. Like, I'm sure you've shaken Georgie's hand. Like, Georgie's got one of them. He's got a hand like RBG. It's just a natural fucking... Matt, Matt, whenever I organize East versus West,
SPEAKER_02: And then often we have guests like Dennis and Levan and all those guys, when you shake, I don't really realize at that moment, whenever I say, hi, how are you, to all of them, their hands doesn't impress me so much, because probably two minutes ago, I shook the hand of Dennis. You understand? Yeah. Yeah, but you can, I don't know. For me, it's, I don't remember how many shakes somebody's had, right?
SPEAKER_03: Every time I shake somebody's hand, it's just something that resonates to me. And Georgie has a hand where it's like, holy shit, this is a dangerous fucking hand. So I'm going to have to give my slight favorite edge to Georgie. And maybe that's because we bonded really good after the tournament is why I'm going with him. But I'm going to go with Georgie on that one. I think Georgie is going to knock Eric down a step.
SPEAKER_01: but but eric is so oppressive on his last go too so and yes sir if it is a top role war between these two georgie and uh rf i think uh rf will have more chances but uh if it's hook then inside georgie is also strong so i understand it will also
SPEAKER_02: so you are you are saying that i will take the handle does that i don't know if it does yes if the vote try to top row then rf will take his hand but if georgie goes inside it will be very hard for rf to resist yeah but do you think he can go inside he was able to do it with kalashenko yeah he was yeah he was
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but don't you think that Arif beat Corey in a more dominant way than Alex Kordesha did? He also had very good back pressure, but we're talking mostly about Arif's side pressure. When you are trying to hook, I have seen Gennady trying to hook Arif and Arif clutching him at Europeans 2016. So, I mean, it isn't
SPEAKER_02: i'm not saying nobody can do i have seen alexander get all of it but it is not that easy it's not that easy but we will see how it will be it can go anywhere if the match stops in an equal position this i don't know is we had a good chance to win but the match may just end up with flash pin as well we will see yeah anyway so let's go to do uh laratin versus tobias
SPEAKER_03: Matthew. Left arm. That's going to be, that's going to be, it'll be, we'll see how, how Tobias' arm is feeling after his injury that he had, right? So. Oh, he didn't have, he didn't have injury with arm. He had the belly hernia.
SPEAKER_03: oh hernia well even then right like that's your abdomen that's core your core muscle is you know the heart of it all right yeah but you have surgery they put a piece there everything is fixed he's even healthier than before yeah okay okay well if that if that's not affecting them um i i
SPEAKER_03: i'm gonna have to go like as much as tobias is is really starting to be impressive he's really starting to make waves and he's still young isn't he like 25 or something like that yeah yeah like he's still a puppy right so it's i i think he's i i think if this match was to take place in two or three years from now i would go with tobias um
SPEAKER_03: As for right now against Vitaly, I don't think Tobias would be able to hold up Dave Chafee as much as Vitaly did. I don't think he has quite the strength of Dave Chafee. And I'm going to have to go with Vitaly as the heavy favorite on this one.
SPEAKER_03: just because the experience that he has, the leverage advantage. Tobias, when was the last time Tobias pulled somebody with that long of an arm?
SPEAKER_03: like Vitaly like and Vitaly is very explosive Vitaly can bang in a hook Vitaly can bang in the top role and not just with regular arm wrestlers like with some of the strongest arm wrestlers in the world like Dave Chafee and I still believe Dave Chafee is one of the top top three top four for strength wise on arm wrestlers that we have in the world
SPEAKER_02: and fatali was able to give him a hell of a match right yeah yeah yeah i have a i will just say something when i won my first walls i was 19 years old i still didn't turn 20. when john won over the top he was what 21 22
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah just I think that like generations are getting a little bit like different that you know used to be when you say like 20 okay he became a man now we see like oh he's still like this he's still like that um I I think I think older generations sorry to say but I think it was tougher yeah and and and you you want
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, actually, I think that Vitaly's left hand is even stronger than his right hand. Also, Tobias, as far as I know, he cannot hook. So he will probably top roll Vitaly. And I think that the riser of Vitaly's hand is too much, too much for Tobias. He will just, you know, just go through his riser. But does he not do low hand top roll?
SPEAKER_02: I, I don't know, but probably I think that, that he will, he will fight with Tobias. I mean, by generally using his riser, like this way. Yeah. So you are saying that probably against the hook is using this, but again, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. About the right and left, like comparing, uh, which Ali is right and left. I have seen in same event is, I don't know, we just flashing him with left arm and him flashing, uh,
SPEAKER_02: that i don't know which right arm but it was during valve yeah like 100 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but the same event right and left you know this don't know easily beat on left arm in step back pressure and quick top roll or maybe outer side pressure and the same if it uh this general with the right arm it is a super shit easy does thank you from the bottom of my heart for the incredible events you provide for the community
SPEAKER_02: You are my favorite puller of all time. Legend. Thank you. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. I think you are saying this to me. But yeah, because I am the only organizer. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. I appreciate. And okay. Another one is getting tougher and tougher. Dave Sheffy versus Rebaz. Yeah, that's going to be a tough one too, isn't it?
SPEAKER_03: but that's why i don't know who it's going to be tougher for if it's going to be tougher for dave or it's going to be tough for robots so i think both of them are very tough match i i think yeah i think like ravaz i think might have a little bit more of a stamina advantage over dave
SPEAKER_02: but I think Dave's initial off the beginning, I think maybe a little more power. So it's, I think this one is going to come to the later rounds myself. Yeah. I mean, for me, in my opinion, Dave Sheff is side pressure is the strongest in the world. And I don't think the match is not going through this way at the start. But the question,
SPEAKER_02: Will it end at the pad or he will stop somewhere and Dave losing his wrist and then Revas continues pulling? I don't know about that one. But I see if it's strapped because Dave's incredible side pressure, the match moving that way. But who knows?
SPEAKER_00: But, you know, if we just simply compare, for example, matches when Artem Morozov pulled with Dzheranov, so he was able to hold him in the first round. Nevertheless, when Morozov pulled Dave Chafee, so Dave Chafee like flash pinned him two times. Morozov with Dzheranov? You meant Rewaz. Rewaz, Rewaz, sorry, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: i hope you say again from the beginning because my mind went there yeah so i mean when morozov uh fight it with uh revas lutidze so in the first round he was able to hold him
SPEAKER_00: From the first round, he hooked him. I mean, he hooked him and in the first round, it was like a real battle. Nevertheless... Morozov almost lost the match. But when Morozov had a match with Dave Chaffee, so Dave Chaffee, as far as I remember, he pinned him like two rounds. Yeah, but just remember this way. Morozov went directly...
SPEAKER_02: inside with Revas, but Dave Sheffy is not going to go inside. So Dave Sheffy will go outside inside pressure and Revas will go fully outside. So like Morozov and Dave will be attacking, they attack different, different, you know, places. Morozov attack to arm of Revas.
SPEAKER_02: while Dave Chaffee will mostly pronating and moving sideways. I'm not comparing the strength, but I'm just trying to say that they won't be doing the same style. Mushaid, how do you see this match? Sir, I think Dave Chaffee is heavy favorite in this match. Heavy favorite, okay. Yes, because side pressure will be too much for Ravaz Latoukse. So I think Ravaz will try.
SPEAKER_01: roll him and they will get a slip and in the scraps, Jeffy will be, I think, hard for Rivas. And Dave is going to flat pin him, like dominate him three times in a row? Yeah, yeah, he will dominate him. And even if Rivas try to pronate him in the defensive top position like this, then I think he will immediately go for a press.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so you are saying that if Revas somehow stops him on his brachii radialis and pronator and then Dave Chaffee will go and then press him like this? Yes, sir. Yeah, that's a possibility because even Hermes had very hard time once Dave Chaffee did that, but what saved Hermes was his ability to go behind and shoulder press.
SPEAKER_02: let's see if we will we are still learning all these matches are happening like we are learning we just find out that directly can that express jumpers and you know we found out that the enemies can go this way against the one so more more they pull more we will find out new things and let's go last two matches matt iraqli zirakashvili
SPEAKER_03: Uh, that's going to be an interesting one too. Both of them, both of them are on fire lately. Like, uh, a rapidly really, really starting to impress me. Uh, his last couple of matches compared to what I think he was actually capable of, uh, the kids, the real deal. Um, it's like, yeah, both of them, both of them are really, really impressive.
SPEAKER_03: They're really, really impressing the hell out of me. I honestly, I don't really know what direction that match is going to go. I know I'm excited to watch it just because I don't know where it's going to go because both of them, the both performances by both of these men in the last couple of matches has been pretty fucking impressive. So.
SPEAKER_03: So yeah, 50, 50 or I'm 50, 50, a hundred percent on the fence on which direction this match is going to go. So most of the people are thinking is the favorite. Most of the people are thinking this way. Yeah. And I, and I could see why people may be thinking that just because he was able to beat John a little quicker than.
SPEAKER_03: then Rockley was able to beat John. But at the same time too, I don't think John was 100% healthy when he pulled. I don't think he was 100% healthy when he pulled either of them.
SPEAKER_03: uh i think he was struggling a little bit with the congestion or whatever and breathing breathing which definitely pays pays a huge heart especially when you get into a stamina match like what they had but uh yeah i i honestly i don't know who's gonna win if i was to be a bet man and i had to make a choice
SPEAKER_02: I don't think I'd be able to give you a choice. I give you one choice in 30 seconds later, it'd be a completely different choice. 30 seconds. I have a question for you. Were you impressed by Ongarbe's performance? Not only the strength, but tactical and timing and everything when he pulled against Michael.
SPEAKER_03: Uh, I wasn't, I kind of knew he was capable of doing that, uh, just with how he had performed in other matches in the past. Um, so no, I wasn't, I wasn't completely, completely blown away by his performance. Cause I'm gonna buy, look at like, I'm gonna buy it was by far the smallest dude in, in the fucking PAL when they were doing the top eight and he was banging with, uh,
SPEAKER_03: banging with fucking monsters and his cool Kong composure the whole time, poker face throughout every fucking match. Yeah, it's yeah, it didn't. Honestly, I wasn't surprised by it at all. I wasn't surprised by it. So he won.
SPEAKER_00: You know, for me, Kadir Gali, he's very universal arm wrestle. So even if he lose like first, uh, first round with, uh, Zerakashvili. Yeah. So he will try something else in a second round. So if, if I would have to bet, I would bet like 3-1 for Kadir Gali. Yeah. There is one guy is asking, uh, what does Matt think about Jordan Sione? My friend, just, uh,
SPEAKER_02: watch the podcast from the beginning. At the beginning of the podcast, he said everything. We don't want to repeat everything again. Sean, send me another super chat. Thank you, my friend. Put some raw carbon between Dave and Revo's hands and then sell the diamonds when they are done pulling. Right. Yeah. Okay, let's go to the last one.
SPEAKER_02: Devin Larratt versus Gennady Kubikminian? Well, obviously, you know who I'm going for. That's not what I am asking. I got to stand behind my boy, right? Listen, listen. Can you give us an objective opinion or not? I honestly, my technical opinion, I really do believe that Devin is going to pull this one off just like he has the other one. But
SPEAKER_03: I do believe Gennady opposes way more of a threat to Devin than Prudnik did.
SPEAKER_03: I really do believe that. And it's not so much that Gennady is willing to fight him a lot more. It's I believe Gennady's aggression and Gennady's explosiveness is what's going to probably cause Devin a lot more issues. So a lot smarter, a lot smoother, a lot more technical arm wrestler.
SPEAKER_03: Gennady's more like a fucking raging Hulk just coming at you. I'm going to hit you in this angle. If that don't work, I'm going to hit you in that angle. He's going to hit Devin in eight different angles in that first match, and every fucking one of them is going to be with aggressiveness, right? Matt, you said that Gennady is going to be harder, but we will see a different Devin as well. I don't think that Devin is going to come
SPEAKER_03: that became for Brudnick. And another thing... That's the thing, you're going to have... You're not going to have a Devin cutting from 265 pounds down to 253 pounds pulling Gennady. He's coming here 280. He will be minimum... You're going to... 280, fucking... That's going to be an understatement. Devin's going to be coming into that match, I guarantee you, at the least, 285 to 290 pounds.
SPEAKER_02: He told me he will be between 275-280. Not less than. I think he is now 270 and 275-280. This is what he told me yesterday or a few days ago. I don't remember. We often talk, video chat. Do you still believe everything that guy says or what? Anyway, but what I'm just saying, you said printing is smarter than Gennady, but you being smart,
SPEAKER_02: doesn't really mean much against devon because no you aren't going to be smart you need to be smarter and it doesn't it's very hard it's very hard and you need to be trickier it's also very hard so but that is why gennady what he has is more dangerous and the thing is like i see only one way i don't know who's gonna win i have
SPEAKER_02: no but like you remember when john uh and devon pulled he came first round very near to the pad and he was like maybe three inches from the pad yeah and then yeah and then he brought back so and almost something similar with with brooding match first round and if devon stop him here what gennady will do
SPEAKER_02: will not be same as john because i heard from directly from devon that he said if john didn't miss the moment and he switched to the shoulder pressure he could oppress him that and what gennady can do there at that point trust me something almost almost double of what prudny can do and
SPEAKER_02: probably minimum 60 70 more than what like he can he can really hit you hit you yeah yeah and then you are conscious open arm open arm you know and often seven goes there under and then this will result a foul he needs to stay here if he stays here there is a possibility him help his elbow to come off or his hand to come so that is the only way i see i don't see it's not my place get out the top rolling
SPEAKER_02: Devon, I don't see Gennady hook him, but I see round one, the match to come, that point. And that is the only dangers personally I see. Other than that, if Devon stops him and then Gennady cannot do anything there, in my opinion, it will be very hard.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and that's what I meant by the explosiveness from Gennady. Not so much as explosiveness just off the go, but throughout the whole fucking match. Even if the match stops, he's bang, bang, bang, bang. Like he doesn't stop. He doesn't stop attacking, right? And with the way John, Paul John's more...
SPEAKER_03: steady pressure steady yeah yeah and when you get into a position i believe like when devin gets in if you know he can bang bang bang bang it could hurt you right like it could it actually hurts you know what i mean and if it's starting to hurt devin and he goes to make an adjustment when gannadi's hitting them again that could be the one or two right yeah yeah yeah yeah so we i don't know but if anyone says that
SPEAKER_03: Gennady doesn't have any chance to win. I disagree with that. I think Gennady poses more of a threat to Devin out of every match that Devin has had in the last couple years besides Le Mans. Out of every opponent Devin has faced, I've been thinking for a long time Gennady is a bad motherfucker for Devin. I think
SPEAKER_03: The worst setup, the worst match he would have against somebody would be against somebody like Hermes. I think Hermes opposes the biggest threat to Devin besides LeBron. But right behind fucking Hermes, I would put Gennady as giving Devin a really, really tough go. Even Morozov. Morozov and Devin. That's a match I'd like to see too. I think that one was it. Did you hear what Morozov said?
SPEAKER_02: What's that? Morozov said that, I said, like, would you hold Devon? And he said, like, he would beat him easy. He said, and he's thinking about, are you not afraid that, you know, he would, if he stops you and then he will start talking with you. And he said that he is gonna hold him and he will talk with Devon. And I said, what are you gonna say? What are you gonna say? He said, he said, he's gonna tell Devon, tell me I am the greatest.
SPEAKER_02: are you gonna say that english he said yeah he's gonna say in english yeah i don't know everybody thinks they can do that i remember prudnik said he was going to do the same thing to him too right yeah i'm going to ask you something after you stop uh morozov losing prudnik and then later beating dave cheffy in august and then uh revas in november
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that this guy is because he's young, he's progressing? I think not only because he's young, he's progressive, but I think because he's fucking smart. I think whatever it was that he lost to when he pulled Trudnik,
SPEAKER_03: He turned around and he went back and he's adjusted the hell out of him, right? Like he's not so much because he's young, he's versatile, he's got the drive. The guy lives in the fucking gym, you know what I mean? Like he's, yeah, like he's, and he's very smart too. Like he's not a stupid puller.
SPEAKER_03: he's not just young and full of brawn like morozov is the real deal like after i pulled him with the left arm i went up to him and i said matt i guarantee you within the next two three years years if you carry on the way you are you will be number one in the world and it didn't even take that long like he's right now he's number one in the world i think with this left arm like in my eyes he definitely is and then with right arm he's a threat for many people many people
SPEAKER_02: like yeah i mean yeah yeah this this guy and he said i asked him where are you now compared to your last rewa's match remember that was match was his fourth competition in nine months over and over and over and over he got minor injuries and he got tired and this and now he has been resting and training and he's fully healthy and still young growing he said he is already easily 20 stronger than that and he is
SPEAKER_02: planning to be much stronger till july when he faces uh saginashvili but saginashvili is yes he is incredible but he's the best he's the king there's no doubt but after hermes proved it he is saginashvili is still human superhuman but still human yeah yeah he believed it and i told this to lebanon as well that you know the sharks
SPEAKER_02: smell that blood. Oh yeah. Yeah. So they are, they are, they are coming. I told this to Levan as well. And he said, he is aware of it. And today, did you see that Morozov is lifting 300 kilo deadlift? Yeah. It's fucking retarded. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he's a tall guy, you know, for tall guy, you know, he did 300 kilo and I tagged, I tagged this, uh, I tagged Levan Saganashvili and he said,
SPEAKER_02: He said, let me see what he said. He said, he kind of, he kind of didn't take it so seriously. And he said, good power lifter. So he meant that that is not going to help him at the table, you know? And yeah. And so I think that, I don't think that Morozov is coming there for paychecks.
SPEAKER_02: Morozov is also one of those guys that running after dreams. Yeah, so he's coming there to prove something. I'm not sure if he can do or not, but he is coming there. I believe in dreams. When you have dream, you're gonna do great things, great. When you don't have dream, you are limited. You're very limited, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So you are saying that Devon is going to win, but it's going to be a very hard match? I think the first two rounds are going to be the toughest for him. And then after that, as it gets later and later, it's going to be more and more convincing for Devon. I think the first two are going to be the toughest. I think Gennady may actually even take the first one.
SPEAKER_03: So I think Gennady has potential to crack on the first freaking round. And then Gennady is the type of person, once he gets that momentum behind him, he almost gains more momentum, right? So I think the first round is going to be Devin's toughest. I think the second round is still going to be a hell of a fucking battle for him. And Gennady may even take the second round too. But I think that's where it's really going to start to twist and turn into Devin's favorite.
SPEAKER_03: especially especially as he has more experience with him because he doesn't have any experience with Gennady see when he pulled Prudnik they around on the table for like a month and a half two months before he pulled Prudnik you know he had an idea on where Prudnik's strengths and everything were he's going into this not knowing a thing about Gennady
SPEAKER_03: where he's actually physically felt him before right and i think that that opposes a little more of a threat to devon as opposed to someone that he's actually felt before right i understand and how do you see this match well i'm uh mad that uh the longer it match goes uh definitely it will favor direct but uh canadi is also a warrior and uh
SPEAKER_01: His hits are not normal, but it depends on, I think, Devin's absorption. If he is able to absorb those hits of Gennady, then he could stop him. And Matt, do you think it's entirely possible that Devin will stumble Gennady?
SPEAKER_03: Like stonewalling? Yeah, right from the start. You know, maybe a little bit moving, but not like... I think Devin's starting to get better and better at staying tighter where he's not opening up as much. There could be a possibility if he does, I think it's going to be him coming more on top of him as opposed to wrenching him out this way, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. And do you agree that if Devon goes inside with Gennady, he may have another tattoo on his bicep? No, I don't think so. It's what Levon said. It's what Levon said. Yeah. Well, then the Georgians are biased, eh? We've already discussed this earlier, that the Georgians are very biased. And he are not, right?
SPEAKER_03: What's that? And you are not? No, I'm giving you my honest to God opinion. I'm biased when it comes to who I want to win, but I'll still give you my honest opinion when it comes to how I think a match could unfold.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Ivan, how do you see about this match? But first of all, I would like to ask you, but honestly, what do you think? I mean, if really Devon will hook Gennady, so how do you see it? You're asking me or Matt? Yeah, yeah, I'm asking you. Oh, I mean, it totally depends, you know, fresh round or later round. Fresh round, no good idea. But after, if he exhausts Gennady a little bit, soften him,
SPEAKER_02: then the things may be different so but fresh rounds fresh rounds i wouldn't go there so do you see that it can be do you see that it can be like the same situation as it was uh with prudnik when devon hooked him in late rounds do you think it no i mean devon didn't go directly he was the second start of the first round and i think he was already exhausted but still even if it was like
SPEAKER_02: right from the beginning like i don't think that that one is behind rudny given insight so it would be maybe more damaging maybe prudnik would win one badly but the second round is still i don't think that like the arm would go he would stop him better better better positions but with gennady is different animal just remember guys i mentioned this all the time but a different gennady will come there
SPEAKER_02: when you are pulling Devon Larratt, you are pulling against the biggest star. I'm not saying the number one guy in the world. Yeah, in 115 years, but not super heavyweight, but biggest star. That's the truth, you know. Over a million, you know, fans on his social media and guys, I don't know, like most charismatic and just like, ambassador, you know, we like him or we don't like him. Like,
SPEAKER_02: Um, and you are pulling against him. You are, trust me, trying to prove something there and it's your opportunity. And Gennady is coming in his best ever shape, best ever. And it was going so friendly until Devon said that Gennady will be like a cow with all four legs cut that, you know, trying to move on the floor, you know, when he
SPEAKER_02: you know, finally brings the game to the endurance game. And Gennady didn't like that. Devon left the podcast, but Gennady started talking. He said, this became personal. He said, this became personal. He has a way of making every match personal, doesn't he, Devon? Yeah, Devon, yeah. And he likes it. He likes to do that. Because I feel more Devon has experienced
SPEAKER_02: highest level of adrenaline in his life. We all know what I'm talking about. So he really wants to feel threatened to perform and bring best of him out. And this is what I understand. This is what I understand that he really wants to make things more personal so that he can perform better. But in this case, he also has
SPEAKER_00: another psychopath at the other side of the table. So it will be fun. Okay, Ivan, we cut you. You asked my opinion about something. Now you give your own opinion. Yeah. So in my opinion, I think that it will be like the biggest match of Gennady's life. I mean, of his entire career. So I see that weight with which he is working is really huge.
SPEAKER_00: But I'm not totally objective regarding this match because I'm a huge fan of Devon. And, you know, for me, I don't see Devon losing this match because I'm a huge fan of him. But I think that it will be also the most difficult match for him. I mean, we are not talking about Levan's match, but it will be a real deal for him. Yeah, I think this is... Levan was...
SPEAKER_02: one level above yeah but this is this is the same level and small details will um make the results this way or that way you know anyways matt thank you very very much for being our guest my friend and i wish you the best and i really hope that you will be successful
SPEAKER_02: and i'll be talking soon in person again hey what's that what's that we'll be talking in person again soon yes six months or so i would love to seriously seriously like i mean it 100 i want to see you on that stage my friend yeah yeah yeah and i don't want to i don't want to prove that's where i belong so yeah yeah i understand and ewan
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, my friend. Thank you. You want to say anything lastly? Yeah, guys, I would also like to thank you for the opportunity to talk with you, to talk with stars like Matt Musk and like you, Engin, because you are also a star of armwrestling. I'm really satisfied. And, you know, my dream right now is to meet together with you in Turkey during East vs. West. And I think that...
SPEAKER_01: my target is in a year we will meet you will see i hope so i hope so my friend i hope so thank you for being our guest sir thank you so much i am very thankful to you for providing us this opportunity to talk with you guys and it's like a dream seriously yeah thank you thank you thank you my friend for being our guest
SPEAKER_02: And thank you so much for giving us these dream matches. Like before, sometimes we only dream about matches like these, which you are providing in East versus West. It's amazing. Yeah, I'm happy. I'm happy. That's my biggest motivation, my friend. When the community and fans, they appreciate, I want to do more, more, more. When I see haters and toxic people, you know,
SPEAKER_02: drama queens are just, whenever I see that they are growing, I'm like, ah, okay, maybe it's not worth, you know, maybe I should just, maybe I should just stop because I'm a retired person. That's when you know you're doing something right. You think, you think? I think so, yeah. I mean, I know what I am doing is right, but if you're appreciated, you want to do more. Like the other day when I was chatting with John on WhatsApp,
SPEAKER_02: he told me some things whenever I read, like, like I was like, almost like, okay, stop, John. I'm so much motivated. I need to do something more. That's good. Whenever I hear Devon, whenever I hear people like you run, you know, and then whenever I see community and then I want to do more and more, whenever I see that with the first opportunity that they just like,
SPEAKER_02: create fake accounts and troll accounts or people that who follows them sends them to my my chat and then throws it all the time and i'm like you know maybe maybe not maybe maybe they are happy with their dramas in the community maybe the providing this kind of level of matches maybe maybe that's not what they need you know and then like we will see we will see i i it is i am a little bit you know uh this motivated but we will see
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, don't let, listen to the masses, right? The masses are speaking positive, so. Yeah, yeah. There's always going to be a few people that try to speak louder than everybody else just because they want to be heard too, right? So. Time will show, time will show. The masses are on your side, so. I hope so. If it is the case, then I will continue, my friend. We will see. I have some promises about some masses.
SPEAKER_02: i for sure will organize them and then i will see the reaction and then then then i will decide we will see anyways given all us given all us die hard armrests or something to strive for again so i love it yeah yeah i love it my friend when i i try to reach a level that elite arm masters can make living
SPEAKER_02: out of arm wrestling arm wrestling so they can really say i'm a professional arm wrestler and that's what i try to do and that is why from the first pay-per-view event to the last pay-per-view event prize money is two and a half times more it's not because i'm growing and i'm keeping something still up to this day i borrow money so that you know i can push push push you know so that
SPEAKER_02: community will enjoy and the athletes would make money. That's my goal, you know, so that this is what we deserve. It's not I'm giving favor or something to anyone. This is what they deserve. Also, this kind of money is involved. It is because of these athletes. Those are our superstars. People want to watch them. It's not because they want to watch me or something. Maybe if I put, maybe some people will want to watch me too. But what I'm just saying, these people deserve and they deserve more.
SPEAKER_02: We are not even a quarter of what we should be. We have a lot of things to do. But some people want to spend this positive energy with very unnecessary things. I hope it is not going to be the common thing. I hope that pure armwrestling and hardcore armwrestling
SPEAKER_02: be the one to choose not not the drama we will see okay okay guys thank you very much once again matt it was great to see you and hope to see you hopefully where october we'll chat soon yeah october yeah yeah thank you guys thank you all right thank you guys nice meeting you good job with you so stay strong
