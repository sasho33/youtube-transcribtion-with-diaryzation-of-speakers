None: Okay, Ertem. If your best 100, what are you now? Where are you? Your form, 60, 70, 80, where are you? 120. You are 120?
Engin Terzi: said you are 120 yes maybe 125. okay okay okay one second when you pull relas now you are more than that much your forms wow and now you have four months to july i will try uh more more more
Engin Terzi: so if you are 100 when it was now you are 125 till july maybe 150. maybe 160. wow you you serious yeah yes real yes wow that's good wow wow this is you you you practice english huh
Engin Terzi: um yeah a little bit now you communicate more it's good wow um okay i think in four minutes paulo will come and um what is your weight your weight how many kilos my weight 135
Engin Terzi: 135 yes yeah and july maybe 140 maybe maybe more maybe more yes yeah that's good that's good my my are you asking my training or his training my training is going not bad i'm like
Engin Terzi: I don't know. Some things like pronator is 85, 90%, but the arm is a little bit less for me. We will see. Yeah. You were saying that everyone was saying level was going to be Hermes easier too, but it didn't work that way. Never know. Maybe he will, but you guys just come here and just spread this kind of things. I don't know what your intention, but, um, you know, I will tell you guys something, you know, before Paul comes.
Engin Terzi: many people says that they complain why does the one not pull more often why he pulls once in a year and once we set the match and they go oh it's a mismatch it's a mismatch so who do you want me to bring someone alien from another planet or something this guy pulled Dave Sheffy this guy pulled Devon this guy pulled Hermes and now he has Morozov and these guys young guys like Morozov
Engin Terzi: They are improving fast, improving fast. You never know. People talk about, oh, Morozov lost Brutnich. It was February 2022. His match with Levan is July 2023, almost one and a half year, almost. With this kind of understanding, we should say,
Engin Terzi: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Okay, at a mass loss against Alex could nature, one year ago, so he shouldn't pull against live on actually this what people said why he pulls against level, but we saw that there was possibility right. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, don't be like knowing like your professor or something just be patient just wait watch nj are missing is to the whole time throwing much no need that. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, No need that you know with that kind of understanding, you can say that.
Engin Terzi: Okay, I like speech and mess and Adam escape trouble to play one, then you can go Dave chaffee beat Alex Alex beat at most at most give trouble to live on, then you can go after morose will be Dave chaffee Dave chaffee beat Alex Alex beat at most, and I must give trouble to the one, this is not my logic is your logic. it's not my logic, but anything can happen just be relaxed just enjoy our listing you know.
Engin Terzi: don't bring you know this guy beat this guy some time ago this guy beat that guy you know it doesn't work that way it may work that way but not always i don't know we will see maybe he's gonna he's gonna be easy maybe he's gonna stop
Engin Terzi: who was expecting Hermes to give travel this way to Levan. Nobody was expecting. So anything can happen, you know. Just support and just wait. You never know, you know. Anything can happen. Yeah. So I think soon. One second. Let me go.
Engin Terzi: okay so you are 135 kilo and you are planning to be even bigger the bigger 140 145 kilo you know yeah i will pull official match yes yes yes
None: yeah i don't know i can see i can see he's moving um so we are waiting for paulo to come and translate for us
Engin Terzi: see another dumb idiot stays playing apple then you made a match to the same thing you said for the air mess and then you saw that it wasn't too early so with your logic who is levan gonna pull jerry if i said jerry you will say mismatch zaur he tore his bicep who is levan gonna pull then he's gonna stay at home and you're gonna bitch about it you're gonna say oh why does levan not pull you know the same guys you know just check the of this channel you know
Engin Terzi: hi hello hello hello paulo i was just just you know i i don't understand these people paulo they same exact people complain why leon doesn't pull more often and when you set a match they go it's a mismatch this guy beat dave sheffield he beat la legend he beat ruby he beat devon he beat hermes so who do you want me to bring
Engin Terzi: that's right i mean these guys are just like not not 90 98 percent of the community normal people but they're one two percent they are just like either they have some unhappy life in their you know that sense of their life to complain about something you know yeah yeah they're just like weird people so before you come we were talking with can you uh increase the volume a little
Engin Terzi: it's at my maximum can you hear me okay yeah yeah now now is much better yeah okay yeah um i was uh yeah i was just yeah before you came you were just saying that you know i was talking with artem artem said he's you know he remember he pulled against uh revas lucid yes and he said
Engin Terzi: if he was hundreds at that time now in his 120 or 125 you know and he said until july he wants to be around like 150 160 so it means that like minimum 50 better shape than last time we saw against us we need to understand something first of all
Engin Terzi: When this guy pulled against Revaz, we saw that, you know, in equal conditions that Revaz gave big trouble to Levan. Of course, it's not the same Levan, but Revaz is also increasing. And so Morozov, we need to realize that from February to November is nine months. In nine months, he pulled four super matches. But less than every two and a half months, the guy had a serious match.
Engin Terzi: this guy probably was tired and he had minor injuries this and this guy is only 24 25 years old but the guy is picking and then so he says that you know he will be around more than 140 kilos till july well i i'm not saying he's going to beat levan or something but you never know you know this arm missing you know especially after we saw hermes's performance against levan psychologically
Engin Terzi: the all the other athletes saw that even not that big but still there is a possibility you understand absolutely yeah yeah you want me to translate to artem or ask him something oh no i just wanted to talk with you about artem we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna talk about some uh other things you know so how does he think like does he feel um
Engin Terzi: mentally does he see a possibility to win like what's his motivation how is the motivation you see very well motivated uh okay
Pavlo: Thank you. Well, Engin asks, in the process of your preparation, do you have at least some kind of mental attitude, or do you see the possibilities that you can win against Ivan and what kind of plan?
Artyom Morozov: In fact, mentally, I feel very good. I am determined to win. In terms of the fact that if before that I was afraid of my opponent, well, somehow I was afraid, now I have no fear at all. Because, well, for that year there were so many competitions that it kind of choked me. And I want to, right now, and I want to, and it turns out, to gain better form.
Pavlo: okay okay yeah after saying that uh yes mentally he feels very very good and if uh if you want to say uh before he was a little bit afraid of his opponent and for the last year he had so many has so many matches that he tempered into the matches and now he doesn't have any fear and uh yeah he's he he he's getting credit yeah yeah this is what i was thinking because from november
Engin Terzi: Last time he pulled against Revaz till July, he has eight months. Eight months, sorry. I should have said six. Eight months. And the eight months, I think, is enough for him to train and heal up and focus only on one target. And does he think that that eight months, total of eight months, is
Pavlo: enough and he has now four more months is it is it enough for him to be at his you know like uh ideal shape um
Pavlo: In order for everything to come to life, for you to rest, and for you to prepare for a new match. Is this enough to fully recover mentally, physically, and prepare well?
Artyom Morozov: Yes, I think it's more than enough, because after my last fight, I didn't train for a month. But I still came to the gym and did something. I was already hungry then, but I knew that I didn't need to prepare anywhere. I can rest calmly and train according to the plan. And already in January I started to prepare. Let me translate.
Pavlo: uh i'm saying yes absolutely it's more than enough and uh after november match he uh he was resting for a month and still he was visiting the gym a little bit because still he was a little hungry uh for you know training and uh since january he's uh getting ready per program and uh yeah and he will be at his best yeah
Engin Terzi: There are two things that surprised me about Morozov against Rewas. One of them was how easily he hooked Rewas right away. And the second that in hook, Rewas gave him so hard time.
Engin Terzi: You know, I hardly kept him here, you understand? So two things, you know, Rehwas has very good back pressure, but Morozov just so quickly hook him. That was one surprise for me. And the second second is that Rehwas is not known for his hook, but he has some frame, you know. But he gave really trouble to Morozov. So after you explained what I said, can you ask him, like,
Engin Terzi: Does he think that somehow with that, you know, many people are thinking that hook is all about the wrist, you know, I mean, wrist is important, but this is mostly like the ability of supination and a little bit forward, you know, movement, you know, that way it looks like this guy has it. So does he think that, does he think that he can hook Levan and if he hooks him,
Engin Terzi: Like, we remember how hard it was him to beat Revaz in hook. Like, can he think, like, does he think that he can beat Levan in hook if he hooks him?
Pavlo: Ok, so he says that there were two surprises for him personally when you fought with Rivas. The first surprise is that you easily and quickly wrapped him in the hook, because Rivas is known for his back pressure.
Pavlo: He says it was the first surprise, but the second surprise was that Rivas was so good in the hook and that he gave you the heat. And the question to all this, he says, listen, first of all, how do you think you can and will you have time to wrap Levan in the hook? And if yes, you think you can and will have time, can you fight him in the hooks?
Artyom Morozov: Is there such a hope? Well, first of all, in the first fight, we don't plan to fight in the hook. We will fight in a different way. But we still train. We train the hook. Everything is possible.
Artyom Morozov: The answer was like this. First of all, he said that
Pavlo: um there is no plan to pull the one in hook at least in the first uh match it will be a different one uh but he says also that uh he training a hook also very hard and that's a possibility in the further matches that uh he will try to do that in the hook
Engin Terzi: hmm but that's i mean so he's he's training all kind of alternatives you know yeah yes but he's not planning it to be his primary you know right yes yeah exactly and then does he think that if he hooks him like why does he not considering uh to hook levan is it because it is harder to hook him like the possibility to hook him is low it's hard to hook him
Pavlo: They ask why this is not your main method that you consider in hooks, because you think that it will be very difficult to wrap it in a hook, or you think that it is very strong in the hook and you will not pull it in the hooks?
Artyom Morozov: No, I don't think he's so strong in the hook that I won't be able to do it. My task is, again, I train everything. And now I even train the hook, and it's better than it was then. That is, I'm more focused, my angles are shorter, and the side movement is good, that is, the speed.
Artyom Morozov: We just stick to the plan that we developed with Babken and Denis. We train other moments. Let me translate.
Pavlo: Answer was like this. He doesn't think that Levan is that strong in the hook that Artyom cannot do anything to him. But they are strictly going by the plan which they developed with Denis and Babkem. And hook is not priority move in that plan.
Engin Terzi: It's a secondary or third, but they are Thomas training hook very hard. And it's part of the possibility if the plan a will not work and say, yeah, I understand. So basically the same thing, everything will be ready, but who will not be like primary, you know? Yes. I understand. And, and many people, many people are thinking that,
Engin Terzi: You lost against Prudnik and you have no chance against Levan. And like, can you compare your shape now with the shape that you have against Prudnik?
Pavlo: Many people think that since you lost to Prudnik in your time, that you have no chance against Levan. Can you compare approximately your form when you were with Prudnik with the form that you will bring to Levan?
Artyom Morozov: Well, I fought with a barbell of only 124 kg, and almost a year before that I didn't fight at all. It was my first competition in 2022, when I fought with a barbell.
Artyom Morozov: That's why I didn't have any practice and I was a bit raw. My training plan was so-so. I had a lot going on. Now I'm ready to fight Prundik easily. Okay. How much do you weigh now, Ertem? 135 kg. 135 kg. Do you plan to go out to Levan?
Pavlo: 140, maybe more. The main thing is to gain strength. The main thing is to gain strength. Only 124 for me sounded a little funny. I gained a maximum of 120, almost suffocated. I'm translating.
Pavlo: first of all that was a first match after about a year break in 2022 with sprutnik so it was a little bit lack of uh you know uh uh practice and uh super matches second of all he was only 124 kilos uh 124 yes 24 yeah yeah 124 so uh and he said
Pavlo: now i can easily pull with prudnik and uh as of today our job is about 135 kilos and uh he will bring to levanse uh approximately 140 and maybe a little bit more so yeah well like by percentage he is just he can say because he said even compared to the
Engin Terzi: uh rewa's match is probably now 20 25 stronger and he is planning to be 50 maybe even 60 stronger so what i am guessing that if he was just say 80 of the rewa's match when he pulled prudny so he is planning to bring something like really almost double yeah yeah but when you are young and with a lot of experience because of your youthness
Engin Terzi: also better preparation many things can really affect maybe it doesn't make double the dumbbell that you're lifting but your effectiveness with coordination and everything you know it can make your performance uh double yeah
Pavlo: Let me ask percentage-wise. Artyom, he commented and said, what do you think, if we compare in percentage terms, not only in terms of weights, for example, it is clear to everyone that you did not lift the dumbbell twice as hard during this period of time, but your working weights plus your healing experience and so on, and so on, do you think that maybe you will be almost twice as much better than you were with the barbell, or is it different?
Engin Terzi: I think Artyom is frozen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, he didn't close out in 2021 November. He was like more like August or July or something. Yeah. Artyom, okay. Yeah, he's frozen. What are your thoughts, Pavlo, about all this?
Pavlo: I think styles make matches so uh uh yeah Hermes definitely surprises all of us and I've been there I've been pretty close and I hear their breath and their you know emotions and everything else so it was a this was a pretty big surprise for me too I did not expect that I expected to see something some motion from Hermes but not not not that much
Pavlo: you were thinking that maybe a little bit slow down here and then go like this yes yes i thought so and you didn't feel like you know he would be a threat do you want to pin him i listen i yeah i was i'm like what the hell are you doing and then then start working i'm like oh my god i was a little bit worried about both of them at the about around three or four because they was it was they was bleeding
Engin Terzi: Both of them. But then it became that Hermes came back faster than Levan to the shape version. But listen, normally there was a foul and there should be 30 seconds break only. But I don't think neither of them were in a condition to get up in 30 seconds.
Pavlo: It took Levans longer, but I saw also Hermes that they really pushed their limits. They've been out of their limits, that's for sure. Let me re-ask Artyom the question. Artyom, in terms of percentage, your form is Prudnik. You've heard of it, right?
Artyom Morozov: Yes, I remember. I started talking, but my phone went out of battery. So, armwrestling is not just lifting dumbbells on biceps. It's also shoulder stretch, it's also lateral movement on the block. Back then, with the barbell, I didn't have any stretch or lateral movement, because I didn't do it at all.
Artyom Morozov: And the biceps was so-so, actually. So, if you take one exercise, if you take one exercise, lifting the dumbbells on the biceps, then, of course, yes, there is a slight difference in percentage. But if you take it as a whole, then in any case, I, in principle, added it everywhere, and it increases the percentage.
Artyom Morozov: I don't want to say too much, but I think 30% is 100%.
Pavlo: yeah uh yeah we start talking about he said yeah maybe if we'll take a separate dumbbell lift for biceps yeah it's maybe not that much of the difference but uh he didn't have a good back pressure he didn't have a good side pressure at that moment and uh you know the experience and enormous thing so counts so he said i don't know i'm not that good at mass and i will not bring the huge numbers but at very least 30 plus
Engin Terzi: I'll be at very least 30% plus. So even the waist that he is lifting is more than 30%? Yes. No, no, he said overall he will be at least 30% better. Okay, yeah. And another question. Is he coming to Istanbul to travel Levan or to beat Levan?
Pavlo: That was a serious answer. For sure, I'm going to beat Levan. Oh, he's coming to beat Levan? Yes. Okay. You know, people... I'm not saying...
Engin Terzi: It can be Levan or obviously I'm an organizer. And Levan on the paper is heavily favorites. But I believe in dreams, you understand? When someone is so hungry for success, when somebody has a dream, I mean, there isn't like, if the guy has the potential, there is always possibility. This much, that much, we will see. But the most important is to have that dream. When you unlock yourself something,
Engin Terzi: Um, and then you really pushing your limits. So that, that is the most dangerous part about these kind of athletes that they are young, they are hungry. You understand they want so much when they want so much, they push themselves so much. So that, that is say, this is the mindset I wanted to, uh, see from him. And that, that, that excites me the same way. Hermes also had the same hunger passion. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: That's the most important thing, you know, like health part way, even you have big potential, you're not going to perform good yet.
Pavlo: That's good, that's good. Let me translate a little bit for Russian speakers. He says, yes, the most important thing is, of course, the attitude, the attitude in the head. He says, I believe that if a person has potential, and he has a dream, he is young and hungry, then it is very, very possible that there will be a big success. He says, yes, on paper, of course, it looks like Lebanon.
Artyom Morozov: But I strongly believe that people with a dream are in a very dangerous and important mood in their head. Well, such people cannot be talked about. Well, in terms of the fact that they can confess. It's good that I'm not like that. Yes, you can't praise. I'm very pleased, but I don't like it.
Artyom Morozov: What did he say?
Pavlo: Yeah, he said that it's my pleasure and he started blushing a little bit, but he said, don't say that because you cannot tell me that I'm good because I may put my nose up too high. I don't want to hear that yet. No, no, I'm not saying that. The guy is already strong, but the only thing is that I see the passion. The passion that the guy wants to win and he wants to prove something. That is number one requirement.
Engin Terzi: be the best that that passion that dream you usually you go back like and then you are thinking before you sleep that that moment you know you just and you just get up because you are so excited you turn the light on and then you go like you know this that is it means that it is in you in your spirit in your heart in your mind that is number one thing and i believe whenever he said that he is coming uh to win it doesn't mean he's gonna win but that is
Engin Terzi: Very important. Yeah. Anyway, so, uh, let's talk about some, some other things. Let's talk a little bit, uh, about, uh, East versus West seven and his match. Uh, this matches, I want to ask his opinion. Let's start with his countrymen, Alizhan Muratov versus Kody Merritt. You pull against Kody Merritt, you know, uh, Kody.
Artyom Morozov: And Alizhan is your countryman. You know his capabilities. So what's your opinion? Translate, Tyoma, no? I got it, I got it. What I thought about the fight, who will win. Adam, well, speed and strength on Alizhan's side. It's 100%. But Kody is very uncomfortable.
Artyom Morozov: Very uncomfortable hand. He stands as if he is spinning. He doesn't pull, he doesn't push, he just as if he is spinning you. I don't know, I was fighting with it. I think it's still Alizhan. Well, 90% Alizhan. And then Ertem says about 90% Alizhan, because speed and strength on Alizhan's side, the only thing that Kody is very uncomfortable.
Pavlo: because he's twisting with his hand all the time, you know, he's twisting, twisting, twisting, and that makes everything uncomfortable. But he still thinks that speed and strength are on Ali Jean's side. So he thinks Ali Jean is going to win. And another one I want to ask him, does he know, do you know Brandon Ellsessor, Artyom? Artyom, do you know Brandon Ellsessor, is there such an American?
Engin Terzi: I will ask your opinion, Paolo. You saw Brandon versus Craig Tiller. You were there when this match happened. And you know Samushia. And how do you see this match, Paolo? Samushia. Samushia is going to hook him? About 75%, yes. You think he's going to hook him?
Pavlo: i think so yes i don't think that i know that craig craig has very explosive forward hook move and he couldn't hook brandon you remember yes yes but uh european style of hooking is a little bit different from our american style of hooking so i think that samusha will be able to hook him okay like like like 75 probably
Engin Terzi: I understand. So you are saying that Samushia is heavily favored? Yes. Okay. Another one I will ask to Morozov. Adam Vorzhinsky versus Bacho Bacho Saginashvili. Does he know? He heard about Bacho? I know Bacho Bacho Saginashvili. He is a cousin of my cousin from Lebanon. I heard about him. I think I saw him at the World Cup once.
Artyom Morozov: I can make a mistake, but I think I saw him. I don't remember how he fights, to be honest. Who is he fighting with? Adam Vorzhinsky. The American. The one that beat Bojidar. Yes, yes, exactly. I think that if Adam beat Bojidar,
Engin Terzi: He thinks that if Adam wins with Bojidar, then he probably will win with Bacho. Yeah, but do you remember Bojidar-Adam match, Artyom? Yeah, Artyom. You remember, right? Yeah, yeah, okay. I don't know. They say that Bacho is a freak, freak of nature. And they think that, I mean...
Engin Terzi: Maybe something different we will see. He needs to be very, very extraordinary to be Adam. If he is Adam and he's really that extraordinary, that will be an interesting day for Armistead World. But if he's not that special, I don't see how, you know, because Adam is also, how do you see that much? What's your opinion?
Pavlo: I believe that Adam is still winning. He will put the brakes on and then this is it. Exhaust him? Yes. And he will stay there for 20 minutes and just look in his soul and then push it to the bed. Okay. Douglas Erlich versus Prokopchik. I will ask your opinion, Pavel.
Pavlo: uh it's gonna be very very interesting match i think that prokopchuk is a little bit favorite but i don't know if much i i i really want to see it after after their match with uh the with uh coach ray he he is good he said that he is right now
Engin Terzi: much stronger and he will be even stronger because that was his comeback match. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just thinking that, you know, like even if he takes the hands, Daniel is very good like this, but also, also Douglas said that he never lost against a dead risk guy, but maybe he didn't meet someone like,
Pavlo: is insane yeah prokopchuk is insane so i think prokopchuk is still favorite but dog is no joke yeah you mean like 55 45 or something somewhere there yes somewhere there close mission and then another one for uh arton arton do you know rob visions rob visions americans
Artyom Morozov: I saw on Instagram that Zurab will fight. He's tall. Yes, yes, yes. I think if he's a top fighter, if he fights at the top, then Zurab will have problems. But anyway, Zurab will win due to his endurance and due to the fact that this guy has long handles. That is, Zurab, he can...
Artyom Morozov: He said that if there is a hook by hook, if Zurab will be able to hook him off the start, it's 100% Zurab.
Pavlo: but if uh you know uh Rob will be able to tap roll him and it's going to be kind of top roll versus hook then it's probably 65 to Zurab 35 to Rob but still Zurab his favorite okay even if he does it will probably go like this he's saying yeah I understand and what's your opinion
Pavlo: i would i would probably agree i don't believe that uh rob will bring the uh form when he beats you know the top uh american pullers because this is kind of comeback for him and i don't think he's at his best shape so i think that zurab is uh
Pavlo: favorite but i would not underestimate rob because his genetic and anthropometric uh gifts you know actually he's a smart guy smart guy whenever we told you the guy is very smart guy yeah he knows what's up it's just uh comeback matches are always you know easy people underestimate him just because he lost against sasho sasho sasha is no it's like a different guy you know different yeah
Engin Terzi: Whenever I organize his match against Irakli, in later rounds, he even top rolled Irakli. You know, and so this guy is very... Somebody is asking your age. My age? Yeah. 42. I will be 43 in three months. 42, yeah. Okay, another one. This one probably he's gonna... I know, I will probably know his answer, but let me ask again.
Engin Terzi: Arif Ertem versus Yorgi Dzeranov. Yorgi is your friend. How do you think it's going to go?
Artyom Morozov: I think that if Georgii will try to fight in the hook with Arif, then Arif will fight very well in the hook and it will be difficult for Georgii. Georgii can lose. But if Georgii gives a good stretch at the start, stretches and does not overshoot his side movement, this center, does not overshoot, does not give up, then I think Georgii will win. But there will be a struggle in any case.
Pavlo: I will cheer for Georgii and I will be in his corner. Okay, so for sure he's cheering for Georgii, but he said that if Georgii will slip a little bit,
Pavlo: he will put him in the hook then it's going to be a very very tough for georgie to win but if he will give a proper back pressure of the start and he will not slip on the start then he is a slight favorite but it's uh it's going to be a very good match he think oh he said that the zero is slight favorite with the back pressure if it starts yes yes i understand how do you see that match
Pavlo: uh i would probably agree with arkham if uh yeah if uh arif will hook him then probably this is it uh yeah yeah you're right i don't know i don't know i don't know it's
Engin Terzi: I think that the start of Arif is better. Yeah, but we don't know where, if it is going to directly go pad or he will be stopping somewhere, what position. But in my opinion, Arif will have the start. But I don't know where it will end up, you know. Close match, close match, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Another one. Ertem, Ertem, when you pull against Tobias, you beat him with, you know, hook.
Engin Terzi: but whenever you topple Tobias, Tobias took your wrist. So Tobias has kind of strong hands, very strong hands. So now Tobias is also very young. He's also growing. What is his chance against Vitalii Laletin with left arm? And Laletin is pulling this way. Tobias is here. How do you see this match?
Artyom Morozov: Vitalii. Vitalii also has very strong fingers. Even if you compare them in terms of strength, Vitalii is a record holder. Even if he stands like this, and Tobias like this, Vitalii like this, Vitalii will fight, he will not try to open it.
Artyom Morozov: Okay, Engin? It's a pretty detailed answer. So basically,
Pavlo: yeah basically he said that vitale has very very strong strong fingers also and he is uh basically a record holder of the you know grip yes yes yes both of them very strongly yeah so he thinks if vitale i'm sorry if vitale will stay here it's going to be still a problem for tobias to open him up and vitale start with the side pressure and he will beat his side pressure
Engin Terzi: with a close grip. But if he will slip on the start, Vitalii will slip on the start, and Tobias will be able to start first and re-grip a little bit, then it's maybe a problem. Papa, he doesn't have to open the finger, you know, it's all about the... Ertem, do you remember the Dzeranov with left arm with Laletin at Waff? The Dzeranov with Lewa. I remember. Remember, Vitalii,
Engin Terzi: No, no, what I'm just saying, I'm not saying that Tobias can beat, but it is not impossible. Because you have strong grip, it doesn't mean that your arm is not going to open, or you can have grip, but your wrist may still go, you know. Grip is okay, but wrist...
Artyom Morozov: Well, in fact, Georgii doesn't have such strong fingers. Moreover, his strong hand is his right hand. Georgii doesn't have such strong fingers, for example, as Tobias. But Vitalii was weaker then, much weaker, because he was constantly on the move, and his weight was less.
Pavlo: Yeah, it's been just loud thinking. It's a little bit hard to compare because Vitalii was different at that time.
Engin Terzi: Dzeranov doesn't have that strong of the fingers as Tobias has. It's very hard to compare, he said. No, I'm not comparing. I'm just saying that just because he has strong grip, it doesn't mean that he's unbeatable, you understand? Absolutely. Because Dzeranov beat him with outside movement. He didn't hook him or something. It is very, very hard to hook Nadezhdin anyways.
Engin Terzi: Just what I wanted to say, you know. Yeah. I don't know. The only big disadvantage of Tobias is that only one month before the East versus West 7, there is the AMC event. And that AMC event, Laleh is getting ready. When he's getting ready for that, only a month later with left arm, he has the East versus West. So my opinion, he will be in incredible shape at that time.
Pavlo: Yeah, you're right. Absolutely. Yeah. Yep.
Pavlo: great so let's go let's go to the next one pauline artom versus sascha sascha yes uh you know what i would say so too but i i say the same with uh you know with uh what's his face i'm sorry um
Engin Terzi: babaev with rostam babaev yeah right so never knows but yeah sasho is favorite for sure i mean i saw i saw pauline probably a year ago probably more than a year ago more than a year ago about 15 months ago against john brzing he really troubled him john even injured his his forearm
Engin Terzi: and then you remember he even changed the color he was just all red you know his forearm and people were thinking that john is holding him john never shows his face you know but it was very very hard match and now paul is much better shape he also beat rambets inside and then he beats samusha and then he beats uh gamtenazze and now he tried to top roll rushtam twice it was a mistake you know rushtam has one of the strongest things
Engin Terzi: And then whenever he hit him inside, Rustam got injured. But that hit was also a very strong hit, you know. Yeah, it was in the middle of the table. Yeah. So what I'm just saying that, like, Paul is hard to underestimate, you know. Whenever you look at the guy, you don't really see him. He's a very nice guy. He doesn't look mean. You kind of underestimate him, but he's a real deal, you know. Yeah. So you are saying that Sasho easily will beat him?
Pavlo: No, no, I'm not saying easily, but Sasho is favorite. Okay, I understand, yeah. Maybe 65 to 35, I would say. Ertem, do you think Sasho is 100%? Or is there still a chance? If something happens to Sasho, that will prevent him...
Engin Terzi: then I think he will be 20-80 in favor of Sasho. Sasho is still Sasho. I haven't seen Sasho losing against a top-roller. He catches, but the matches that he lost against Kocak, he lost against Spartak, he lost against Hajimura, all were by controlling Sasho's
Engin Terzi: I think the more you pull him, the more you are going to the trap, you know, because the guy has incredible side pressure in a supinated position. Yeah. Anyway, so let's go to the next one. Dave Chaffee versus Ravas. Ertem, you pull against both of these guys. Ertem. I think we are still the favorites in this fight.
Artyom Morozov: Dave Chaffee. Dave Chaffee, I think. Well, it's about 60 to 40. But Rivas can still give. If Rivas will fight in the hook, then there will be a fight for endurance. And I don't know which of them will be more endurance in the end. But if Rivas will fight in the top,
Artyom Morozov: Dave has a very strong stretch and lateral movement. I think Dave can win. But I want to see it. It's a very interesting fight.
Pavlo: Artyom says that it's a very interesting match and he wants to see it, but he thinks that Dave is a favorite, like 60-40. But he says also that if Rivas will go into the hook, it's going to be an endurance war. And very maybe that he will have a chance, better chance.
Pavlo: if it's gonna if it was will try to top roll him he said it's uh it's a problem because Dave have a very good back pressure and a side pressure so that's his opinion does he think that you know when Dave is moving sideways there is a possibility they have to lose his list because it was back pressure or not not at all
Artyom Morozov: Do you think that if Dave goes to the side after the start, then because Rivas has a good tension, Dave can start to lose his hand, or will it not happen? Well, we saw that, for example, it did not interfere with Dave with Vitalii Laletin. It will be decided who will be more resilient to the fight. That's what will decide.
Pavlo: Yeah, Artyom says that, you know, it did not play a big role when he was pulling Vitalii. He was still able with a slightly compromised wrist to finish. But he said most likely it's going to be an endurance war. Whoever will have a little better endurance. I understand, yeah. And in your opinion, Pavel? I think Dave is a slightly favorite, but again, yeah.
Engin Terzi: endurance if we'll if dave will guess out uh it's yeah it's maybe a problem for him otherwise he's a favorite i mean when you are pulling a super match endurance is part of the game you know i don't know yeah now i know very good yeah and i didn't ask you vladet versus tobias pablo
Pavlo: Tobias is, I saw Tobias in 2019 live in the Zloty last time. And he impresses me very much. And then I've been following him on social media.
Pavlo: So he's very young and he's very fast growing. I think Vitalii is favorite, but not as much as we may think. It's maybe like 55-45 or maybe 60-40. I mean, he's getting there. Tobias is definitely getting there. So you are saying that Vitalii on the paper for sure favorite, but you cannot say that Tobias doesn't have chance at all.
Artyom Morozov: Yes, absolutely. I think he has a chance. And he has a pretty good chance. Yeah. And let's go. Let's go to a very important match. Gherakli, Zirakashvili, Fedor Galo, Ongarbaev. Ertem. Here, in any case, Gherakli is very strong. Ongarbaev is very smart.
Artyom Morozov: If Irakli turns on his strong sides, then there is a possibility. But it's very difficult to do it with Ongarbaev, because Ongarbaev is our Brzenk, you could say, from Kazakhstan. So I still think that Ongarbaev is the favorite. Okay. Yeah, he said that Irakli is very strong.
Pavlo: uh but angarbaev is very smart puller so he said if iraqli will uh be able to connect his strong parts then he have a chance but he still said anger by his favorite is that angarbaev is our kazakh brzing i mean my opinion is that i think that iraqli has more force power
Pavlo: but but has better control so like I don't know how have you seen that much Paul that that I think it's maybe very close because of the iraqli iraqli's back pressure he have a very good chance I think that ongarbaev uh is a slight favorite uh but I don't see a huge difference I mean uh 60 40 probably on the right
Pavlo: Andrabayev, yes. But I would not underestimate Irakli's power. Sometimes those 10% difference or 5% difference in the power will eliminate experience and the ability of control. I understand. And the last one. Devon Larak versus Genadi. Arzun.
Engin Terzi: I have a question for you, Ertem. Before that one, I have a question for you. How do you see your match against Devon? I would win easily. I would win easily, he said. Easily you will win. Yeah, he said I would win. With Genadi, damn, Larratt is such a cheater. Cheater. Cheater.
Artyom Morozov: Genadi is also very clever and strong. I think the fight with Prudnik will be as good as the one with Larratt.
Artyom Morozov: But I don't think Genadi will give up like Prudnik. Genadi will do his best with his temperament and character. And it will be very interesting to watch. It's 50-50, actually. Cool. He said that it's a very, very interesting one. And he believes it's like 50-50. Genadi Endeavor? Genadi Endeavor?
Pavlo: Because he said that most likely, he said that Devon is a cheater, but do not underestimate Genadi, because Genadi is very small cooler too. So he said that Genadi, the scenario of the supermatch will be approximately like Prudnik and Devon, but Genadi have a more hard and he will not give up until the end of it.
Pavlo: And he said, that's going to be a very interesting one. Yeah. Morozov, Devon said that he is gonna make Genadi quit. Genadi will say, okay, you know, enough. Genadi is going to give up. Submit. Can you ask him? Larratt said that Genadi will give up completely. That he will die at the table and say, that's it, I give up. Do you think this can happen?
Artyom Morozov: He said 50-50, but Genadi will not give up. He will fight to the end.
Artyom Morozov: fight today okay okay and can you ask him like he thinks that gennady is gonna win with a dead wrist or something
Pavlo: he said that it's very possible that it will happen because it's we already saw that with the one and he said very possible but he said also very possible that larat will not be able to open up his wrist and then he will go right there okay okay i understand yeah and devon said that devon said that
Artyom Morozov: He's gonna take Genadi's soul. Yeah, that's what he said. It turns out he's Dementor from Harry Potter.
Pavlo: he talking swank i will not translate that i don't know how to translate that harry potter was one of the uh characters who've been taking other characters souls i i mean i don't know harry potter that well i don't know the names okay okay um but but you remember the uh
Engin Terzi: elm street nightmare the yeah yeah he was also taking the souls there yeah yeah that i remember that yeah that's because we are we are all these these are young generations um ask him if he would pull against devon first ask him did he see his match with sandris
Engin Terzi: if he would pull against devon would he be afraid that some point if the match goes to endurance point and devon starts talking with him and like makes him helpless he can't move anymore like like how prudny happened how this happened with the john and how it happened with thunders would he have that kind of fear to pull against
Pavlo: Devon that, you know, would cause some psychological damage? He says, what do you think, if your match with Larratt took place, he says, do you have such a fear that something would happen to you that would stop you and the moment would come when everything would be over, everything would be over and you wouldn't even be able to move. Do you have such a fear before that? And he starts talking to you, getting into your head.
Artyom Morozov: How can such a fear arise if such a situation does not arise? First of all, Prudnik and Sandris allowed him to impose his own.
Artyom Morozov: Larratt has a secret weapon, a woman who holds him and screams behind his back. It also psychologically presses on athletes. And while they are screaming with her, Larratt slowly takes his. And that's why they are already starting to fight, roughly speaking, with losing positions.
Artyom Morozov: I wouldn't let him do that. And secondly, if I was told that I was going to have a match with Devon, I would have prepared in such a way that I would already be talking.
Pavlo: okay uh it's about five pages of text so i i will give you a concept he said first of all there is no fear because this situation is impossible so as he said before yeah yeah he will win easily and then he said yeah that that's the problem of tobias improving that they let devon do whatever he wants and gain the position because devon has a psychological weapon
Pavlo: behind his back is a screaming woman who is helping devon to gain that position and grab the grip everything from his opponents and he said if that match would be happening i would be that ready that i will be talking by the table you will he will hold him and talk to devon wow wow that is that's interesting by the way by the way
Engin Terzi: right now as of watching this i get some this is how tobias looks right now oh yeah i like it i asked him i asked him to send his measurements for his uh trading cards and other things and he said this with bicep 54 centimeters
Engin Terzi: that's a big boy yeah it's 53 come on okay 53 yeah sorry 53 yeah almost like yeah and i think forearm is 47. that's huge yeah yeah yeah it's 47. yeah so this guy i'm telling you these young guys are getting bigger
Engin Terzi: and bigger and stronger and this is his weight his trainer just said 132 and yeah let's see so he's saying that artem is saying that if he ever pulls devon he's gonna hold him and talk with him yes you're gonna you're gonna speak in russian or english
Engin Terzi: What's that? He said, I will speak English. Tell me, tell me I'm the greatest. Sure. So you're going to, you're going to tell Devon that you are the greatest. Oh yeah. Wow. That's cool. One interesting message as well, you know. I want to see this, please. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: as soon as i finish this hello devon did you see what artem said i love it i love it i i just love that you know community is happy you know that we all have the same uh that we missed a super chat by silky wilkie thank you my friend will ongar be able to beat iraq's back pressure um he is asking
Pavlo: Because Irakli has so much back pressure, can Ongarbaev match his back pressure even with him? Can you ask Artyom what he thinks about this? Artyom, there is a question from the super chat. There is a question. What do you think, will Ongarbaev be able to put the same tension against Irakli and will he be able to beat him precisely in the tension?
Artyom Morozov: I think he will be able to do it without any problems. It will be enough for Ongarbaev to put his hand out, I think. And to take away the tension. And there will also be a struggle for endurance. It will also develop, as with Berzenko, but I think that Ongarbaev
Artyom Morozov: At the moment, he is younger and fresher than Berzhenko. He has more keys in stock. That is, he can also adjust the triceps. Yes, that is, he has more control, his angle will not be like Berzhenko. You think that he can also match the stretch without any problems? Yes, without any problems.
Pavlo: yeah and he said that uh yeah he he can match the back pressure uh the only thing he will have to do is make sure that his posting is correct and his wrist is uh you know still he has the risk controller yeah yeah yeah yeah one guy said that engine is in love with devon's behavior on the table no i'm not in love my friend it's a nightmare
Engin Terzi: imagine you're pulling the guy he just doesn't even ping you hold you hold this is a world level match that everyone is watching millions are watching eventually on youtube and everywhere the guy is just holding you and looking at you and say like you know pull me fight me you know you know and that that i i'm not in love with it but it can be a very big nightmare you know but good that you know uh morozov doesn't think that way he thinks he can beat him
Engin Terzi: and he can tell him that you know i'm the greatest wow wow that that's that's interesting yeah and and another question who is like uh technically
Engin Terzi: Technically, who is the hardest opponent for you? Like, how do you see you versus Hermes with right arm? Okay, okay. Ask him this way. From hardest to down,
Engin Terzi: Like, what are the hardest opponents for him? Like, first probably Levan. And what's the second hardest? Who is the second hardest? And third?
Artyom Morozov: Vitalii. I think Vitalii. Because his arm is long, it can be uncomfortable. Zaur. Zaur. He hasn't played for a long time, I don't know. He's still strong. Chaffee.
Artyom Morozov: I think Hermes is also in third place. Levan, Vitalii, Hermes. Hermes, Dave and Zaur.
Engin Terzi: no no i understand he said the the yeah the way that he's saying like can you ask him like um technically probably rewa's not rewa's latin is even maybe harder than uh levan technically not the power but technically
Engin Terzi: Technically speaking, in Italy, it's probably even more difficult than in Lebanon, right? Not in terms of strength, but in terms of technique, yes. This is because he's very tall for an arm, and he keeps his ear far, you know. Yeah, yeah. But of course, Lebanon is stronger. But, you know, being strong and then being uncomfortable for the opponent, they are the difference, you know, yeah.
Engin Terzi: sometimes if you can apply your power i mean you can do something but if you cannot apply because of the you know the guys two meter and what five centimeters or something you know and then he keeps his arm far so you cannot really go around you know because he keeps it already far the fingers are very strong so i don't know so also can you ask him how does he see his chance against ermis and messengers
Pavlo: How does he see percentage? His chance against Ermes or against Jerry, right? Both of them, yeah. What are your chances if you would fight Ermes and what are your chances if you would fight Jerry?
Artyom Morozov: With Jerry, I think 80%. Maybe 70%. I wouldn't let him impose what he imposed on Georgii Tsvetkov and Genadi Kvikvinia. I wouldn't let him do that. With Hermes...
Artyom Morozov: he said that i don't like to give myself a percentage high percentage but he said
Pavlo: I think that with Jerry, maybe 80% or 70% to me, because I would never let him do what he did to Tsvetkov or to Kutvinia. And with Ermes, he said, I'm a favorite, probably the same percentage, because he's very comfortable for me. Ermes is very comfortable for Artur.
Pavlo: But does he realize that there is a big difference between his left and right arm? Well, I also have a big difference between my right and my left arm.
Engin Terzi: He said that realistically, I have a same probably difference between my... Yes, yes. This is what I was thinking. Many people think that Morozov's left arm is stronger than his right. But because my opinion, can you ask him this? Because his competition is tougher with right arm. The full competition pool. Because the Laletin didn't get involved with left as of till now.
Engin Terzi: Dennis didn't get involved yet. He didn't pull with Kurdeca and Levan is injured. He couldn't come back. Dennis couldn't come back yet, you know? So the competition with right arm is much tougher than left arm. So, and then he needs to fight in the tougher competition with right arm while not the same level with left arm. I think automatically his right arm is getting stronger and stronger. Does he agree or he thinks different? Can you ask him?
Pavlo: Yeah, you're absolutely right. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: anyway so uh uh our time you come in istanbul he said yes thank you for inviting i'm coming i know it is our pleasure and uh honor for us uh i'm glad to see him that
Engin Terzi: He came a long way from February 2020 to the bullet against Prudnik and now beating Dave Chaffee and Ravas and now he's getting ready and he believes in himself. He's coming to win. I don't know about that one. No comment, but what I'm just saying that I'm happy that we have someone new in the conversation.
Engin Terzi: of the best uh super heavyweights in the world and um just can you tell him that i'm happy that you know he came this much
Pavlo: I will translate. Engin said that he was very happy that you made such a serious path since February 2022. And now that you have progressed so much, it is very nice to have a new person in our discussions of top poolers. I understand. Star athletes who are at the very top. And he says, welcome to Istanbul.
Artyom Morozov: My pleasure. Yes, it means I'm very happy to see you. Thank you. In fact, this is all that has happened to me over the past year, and at the moment there is a great merit of Engin in this.
Artyom Morozov: Therefore, we are very grateful to him. What he sowed, now it is happening. That is, he sowed good grain, and now we are all happy to grow grain.
Pavlo: uh artem says thank you very much engen because uh it's a huge part from what happening with him is yours and he said that you plant that seed and that uh seed is growing now and that's that's your seed you did it yeah but you need to remember that i give that opportunity to everyone yeah so it is not because of me i give to everyone that opportunity
Engin Terzi: He used his very well and he brought himself up there. And once again, you know, thank him for being part of this. And can we ask him if he wants to say anything anymore? Does he have any message for Levan? And then we can finish.
Pavlo: Thank you very much for being a part of this conversation. If you have something to say, maybe a message to Levan, we will say goodbye. Levan, I recently saw a video of him following me.
Pavlo: message to levan levan posted the video that he's coming for artyom oh he made a video when yeah i don't know artyom saw it when did he do that andrei lucenko channel
Artyom Morozov: Maybe a week ago, maybe two weeks ago. After Kangin said on the air that there would be a fight.
Pavlo: uh after you said uh in uh uh you know in life that it's gonna be the matches set yeah it's about three or two weeks he doesn't remember exactly but he said i'm coming for you and arkham says levon you don't have to come for me i will come down myself
Engin Terzi: Yeah, that's good, that's good. Ertem, believe in yourself. And some people misunderstand me. There was a video, the SG records, he made it, like more than 250,000 people watched. In that video, I encouraged Ermes. But it is not because Ermes is my friend, but Levan is my friend too. I mean, there is no difference. Those are our respects, same Morozov, same Devon.
Engin Terzi: But in that video, it's not because I want Hermes to win, but Hermes was heavily underdogged, you understand? Heavily underdogged so that I had to encourage him so that people would see something great match and he said, oh, like six times like this. And it actually happened like this, you understand? So it's the same way. This is the, Levan is the king. Levan is the Mount Everest for sure.
Engin Terzi: And Morozov is 25 years old, young guy. So this is nothing against Levan. Levan is really like my brother, you know? So there is no difference. But again, we need to encourage the new ones, you know? So to make sure that they believe in themselves and fight, you know? So I wanted to explain to the community that I don't have any force in this race, you know?
Artyom Morozov: Maybe you can explain so that he would... He probably understands, he shakes his head, but... Yeah. Ertem, do you understand or do you want to help a little? Yes, I understand, in principle. Despite the fact that Ivan and Ermes are his friends, he wanted Ermes to win, because he was an underdog. Well, yes, and he also supports you now and charges you with a positive, like, come on, guys, fight. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.
Engin Terzi: Thank you from the all soul. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Ertem. Get ready. Just please don't be so blind with your passion. Devon't get injured. No trauma. Be careful. Yeah. And Paolo, as always, thank you very much, my friend. You just won the Arnold Classic. I did. Yeah. And was it like 220? What was the category?
Pavlo: 242. oh there is 242 right yeah and now you're planning to compete the east versus west qualification yes i have another super match left hand uh this saturday i'm going to mississippian pool jonathan brida and then yes i'm coming to indiana to cobra roads uh i think in virginia you will have probably
Engin Terzi: more prepared marcio because he's just making a comeback after the injury and then i think matt mask will be there that i just can't wait to see that the final 240 finals it will be incredible and let the let the best one win and hopefully we will see one of you guys here and who you who you want who you want to see there uh the best one okay
Pavlo: Sure. And you? No problem. You mean that's you, right? That's what you're saying? We'll see. I would not underestimate neither of those two guys. And I believe favorite will be Marcio there. But we'll see. You mean that Marcio will be favorite against you as well? Against me and against Matt, yes. Matt has beaten him. I have seen it.
Engin Terzi: but what makes you think that he will be favored because you recently beat him and i think you pull him only one week after dubai yes i pulled him right after dubai i was a little sore still but it's not the case uh i my strongly believing he
Pavlo: underestimate me a little bit because we pulled about two years ago he beat me very easy i was out of shape but it doesn't matter he did not know that you know and i believe in that first match he just underestimated me so you are saying that he will come more prepared yes yeah let's see let's see how it will be but you all three you all deserve to be here
Engin Terzi: you all like matt you marcio but let's see what's going to happen and did you learn anything after your dubai experience what did you do tell us okay okay first
Pavlo: First of all, there is much more involved to preparation to a professional six-round supermatch than to anything else I've been to before. This was my first professional six-rounder.
Pavlo: and uh it was a little bit short of the notice but it's probably not the case i did the biggest mistake of everything is uh i did not drop the weight right before the match even my endurance was on point i was breathing fine my heart rate was okay but uh my arm bloated right away it was you know as a wood i that's it
Engin Terzi: second match i was pumped completely do you think that you do you think that you should be using your wrist more active instead of more arm like do you use you think enough using the hands like current opponent cronators uh i i tried i tried but i'm not talking about specific match generally generally you are you are using a lot of arm you know yes yes
Pavlo: I think your arm is stronger than your hand. You know, this is how I feel sometimes. No, I'm very strong, but I'm not as good a arm wrestler. I'm getting better now because I'm having all the experience I'm getting. My wrist is not weak.
Pavlo: I can hold my wrist, but for some reason, I cannot engage together, you know, cupping and arm. So my arm goes first and I keep the straight wrist. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is what I'm saying. Your hand may be strong, but the center of your power is not with the hand, but like you said, the arm is moving first. Faster. Yeah.
Pavlo: i'm working on it it's not because my wrist is weaker my wrist is uh uh good i can hold on but or i can cop but uh i don't know for some reason i cannot engage them both together i'm working on it yeah yeah you will only get better it is always good that you have some missing parts it just means that you will be more dangerous than what you are now when you also fix that problem yeah once again morozov show us your bicep again
Engin Terzi: Yeah. How big is it? Ertem, how big is it? 52 cold. 52 cold. So when he comes in July, it will be 55 cold. Maybe it will be more.
Engin Terzi: maybe even more we'll we'll see okay okay anyways thank you thank you guys and thanks to everyone who watch us thank you
