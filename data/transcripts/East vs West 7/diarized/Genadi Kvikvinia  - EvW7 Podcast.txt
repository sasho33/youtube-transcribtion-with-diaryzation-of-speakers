Engin Terzi: In your opinion, I was just asking what will be a good training outside of armors and get better finger strength for holding. My friend, for me, the, the, the handling the pressure is more important than applying pressure. And I used to be a roofer. I work on the roof, those single bundles, they were like, probably
Engin Terzi: 85 pounds or something they were like thank you can you hear me yeah yeah i hear you but you see it but and you see me too right yes yes i do yeah great and i was carrying two of them at once as long story but um because you couldn't grab them your fingers were staying like this i think they're not came another is here
Engin Terzi: Hello, Genadi, how are you? Genadi, my friends, everyone is thinking that you are scared of Devon. And that is why you don't post anything on YouTube. Devon says that you will not come to Istanbul. You are scared. Is that true? Sorry, I was moderating the chat. Sorry, sorry. Can you please repeat?
Genadi Kvikvinia: Devon is saying that Genadi is not on social media because Genadi is scared of Devon. And Devon says that Genadi will not even come to Istanbul because he is so scared. Why? Why? Why?
Genadi Kvikvinia: These are my thoughts. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today.
Genadi Kvikvinia: So he said that the reaction about what Devon told about him was like, pity Devon, pity Devon, he kept saying it. Then he said that about his latest updates about why he was missing from social media is that currently right now- Can you speak a little bit louder? Yeah, I could.
Genadi Kvikvinia: So currently he's in the building that is his like future store so he was just renovating the gate and taking care of it so that's why this like eight days of later is he he's out of this social media but.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Whenever he saw Devon's video, he kept sharing them and then he said about the video when Devon has this long nose, you know, one of Devon's video, he said that if it was boxing, if it was real boxing match, but not arm wrestling, he would really have made Devon's nose like that. But since it's only arm wrestling, the best he could do to Devon is to just
Genadi Kvikvinia: break there was arm so that he would just hang his arm like this and then uh go back to canada that's basically okay okay because devon also said that he's gonna break again at his shoulder
Engin Terzi: that's a screwdriver like automatic and he said that i'm gonna screw it down he's gonna screw devil's shoulder can you did you did he see that today uh i couldn't reach devon but devon says that he injured his thumb he may have surgery did he did he see that video
Genadi Kvikvinia: Genadi, have you ever seen Devon's video? Dave you ever seen Devon's video? Yes, I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it.
Genadi Kvikvinia: uh-huh so he's saying that they should stop crying about it because uh we are men and uh sometimes we break our fingers like he himself also has broken it a couple times or maybe a thumb or something like that but as we are men we have to keep fighting and uh put ourselves 100 regardless so stop crying does he does he think that devon is just like creating excuses to
Genadi Kvikvinia: You know, run away from Genadi. Anu, you said that you would like to say something about your experience and what you think about it, and what you think about your experiences and what you would like to say about it, for example, in the video. I don't have anything to say. I don't have anything to say. I would like to say that I came to Canada.
Genadi Kvikvinia: he says that that's the only way uh devon has left like that's the only way the outcome like to make excuses and he repeated himself that he will break leon's uh deon's entire arm and hang it on his shoulder and uh make him yeah send it to kind of like that there is only one way they want to survive from this is just to create excuses and not to show up yes
Genadi Kvikvinia: Okay, I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And can you ask him, how is his training? Like, is he, what's his shape?
Genadi Kvikvinia: so so far uh as his training goes on and on he's actually increasing a bit slowly but increasing the weights so he's keep progressing and whatever shape he is right now that's not gonna be the shape he's gonna show up because he keeps progressing but he said that like last two weeks like 15 days before match he will slowly start to rest okay the question is there any possibility
Genadi Kvikvinia: I remember during the pandemic, he was in incredible shape. I saw him with some trainings. Does he think that he will reach to that shape? Or not possible? I would like to ask you a question. You said that you were in the form of a horse.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I mean, it's easy for you to say, oh, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but,
Genadi Kvikvinia: I can't remember the exact date, but I think it was around the end of the 20th century. There were 10,000 people in the city. It was a 90-degree wall. The walls were made of metal, and there were no walls in the city. But there were 10,000 people in the city. Your record is... There were 95,000-96,000 people in the city. There were no metal walls in the city.
Genadi Kvikvinia: uh so uh about his uh trainings like he said he keeps getting uh um progressing and progressing but once he he did like personal record pr on his
Genadi Kvikvinia: single bicep curl single arm bicep curl is like 100 kg he did once and the angle was quite close to 90 uh 90 degree degree but in order to uh not sustain any injury he just tries to be very careful so he only did it once and now he's doing like 85 90 kg at most
Genadi Kvikvinia: uh this single bicycle uh regarding to his weakest point right now is that the thing that he cannot uh do that much from both arms is that his left arm was kind of bad left biceps he had injury and now he this lefty also is getting back to shape so he did like 130 kg or bicycle or with both arms with two hands 130 he said
Genadi Kvikvinia: and uh but left is still quite not in the best shape it was injured so now he's only doing like single one one reps one one arm reps yeah so i mean basically that will he be at his best ever shape when he peed yeah yeah and he actually i almost forgot so good that you uh we asked it uh he started by saying that uh uh his pandemic shape what he had he already surpassed those weights that he he was pulling during bedtime
Engin Terzi: Oh, okay. Now he's even better in shape than that one. Yeah, yes. That's what he said. Oh, okay. So he's coming in like incredible shape. Yeah, he said that this Devon match motivated him the most he has ever been. Oh, okay. He's very motivated. Like, does he take this match any little personal? Like after the last podcast with Devon?
Genadi Kvikvinia: Genadi, when you were on the podcast, you were with us for a long time, and you were talking about what you were going to do in the future. Do you have any plans for the future? Do you have any plans for the future? No, I don't have any plans.
Genadi Kvikvinia: He's saying that, yeah, I mean, to be honest, Devon really angered me. That's what Genadi said from the last contest. And he said that Devon should have two bodyguards, but both of them should be bigger than Genadi because
Genadi Kvikvinia: I mean, if something goes in a sideways during the press conference, he may just jump over again. He may just jump over the tables and just rush to Devon and something may get broken there or physical or something. So Devon should have some like at least two bodyguards bigger than Genadi. Just in case. We need to bring there some security. Yes, yes. OK, OK, OK, OK. And can you tell him how confident is he?
Genadi Kvikvinia: He wants to show you one picture, if you remember about this picture. Oh, yeah. Okay, one second. Can he bring it closer?
Genadi Kvikvinia: I see you there, Engin, on that picture. I see myself, but who's the other guy? OK, who is he? .
Genadi Kvikvinia: Hello, hello, hello. How are you, he's asking. Yeah, yeah, thank you, thank you. I hope you're OK as well.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I mean, Roman, these people are... Yeah, Beso is saying that you are a really good person and all the time he speaks positively about you. Thank you. Beso, Beso. Oh, Beso, yeah, thank you, thank you. You know, these are like, almost became like family, you know, from early 90s, there was Zaur, there was Davit Shalitze, and there was...
Engin Terzi: and there was some Karadze and others. After that, later there was like
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah and then later in the 2000s 2000s there was like now it came like java and gennady and some new and then after that like i know georgian generation for 30 years you understand from early 90s you know and
Genadi Kvikvinia: Genadi is from the mid-middle of the 2000s. Genadi, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Englin. Now he's showing your polling video that you don't even have it. Even you don't have this video that he's showing you.
Engin Terzi: Oh, yeah, yeah. It's just Pata, yeah. Pata, Pata, yeah. Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Genadi, in the competition, I pulled the Russian final, Valery Gusov from Othetia. Valery Gusov? Yeah. And he also beat Rustam Dave around those times. And then in the final, Genadi, I beat him.
Engin Terzi: I was so like crazy angry guy, you know, and referee said, strap. And I was just more angry. And then, you know, you know, Niazi, right? Niazi. And Niazi is photo. And then me, ready, go. Boom. Final, final, final. Ready, go. Did you take picture? Picture. And then I let the guy to do this close. He's trying to beat. And then I was like, did you take picture? Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: boom you know final match you know just like uh but i was just a little bit crazy yeah because of the referee referee not the opener
Translator: I will briefly translate in details. He remembers, yeah, he knows that story, Genadi said. Genadi knows, yeah, yeah, yeah. You are a very big, big sportsman, that's what he said.
Engin Terzi: he's asking you about the possible match if you get in shape if you are trying to get in shape for some mission yeah but now no now samusha here me here now but slowly maybe maybe maybe we will see yeah it's good to hear it
Genadi Kvikvinia: i'm very happy that you are okay that the only reason sorry he has some audio issues he can cannot hear and he will fix it well i hear you i hear yes for me everything was fine yeah for me everything was fine again against me
Genadi Kvikvinia: I guess Genadi has a problem. He asked me to repeat myself. It's lagging. He got a call on his phone and it connected. Now he will leave us and then we join.
Genadi Kvikvinia: oh yeah yeah there was a picture yeah yeah oh you got some super chats yeah i will ask him yeah whenever he comes back yeah he's trying to leave now or yes so he wants to leave and then come back yeah and hopefully it will get better like fixed
Genadi Kvikvinia: uh at first you and you told me my audio was kind of low now it is okay right i i switched it was not because of the the settings but because you were speaking a little bit low volume could be
Engin Terzi: No, no, my friend. I need to go down to 85 kilos. Oh, you mean to 75? 75, I cannot go down to. I mean, I can. I can. I'm just like one crazy guy. I made 65 kilos. 143 in 2018 when I was 44 years old. I was 85 kilos. But I made 65 kilos. I won the world. He's big. Everything is good. Yeah, yeah, that's good. There is a question. Thank you for your super chat.
Engin Terzi: Genadi, what if Devon holds you and tells you, yells at you, . It's a question. He understands. He understands.
Genadi Kvikvinia: even if uh even if devon uh appears and shows up like 100 times stronger than kenadi if devon during that moment or any time any moment in arm wrestling screams opana
Genadi Kvikvinia: Genadi will rip his arm off because that's his signature like this type of yelling voice speech award and he gets he gets stronger and stronger so it's actually bad if he does it or them if Devon does Opana to him and then he will only make Genadi stronger exactly
Genadi Kvikvinia: yeah he just said that he gennady will be the one who stops him and calls him to tell him to fight him oh yeah yeah yeah gennady tell us my friends how much do you really believe you can beat devon
Genadi Kvikvinia: he's saying that uh it may and most likely will be a fight very tough match so i he didn't say but i guess he's saying that it will be all five rounds will be performed
Genadi Kvikvinia: but uh in the end he will win so i guess three two maybe he brought up the example of his match against dave chafee everybody was sure after two zero when
Genadi Kvikvinia: Genadi was down to 2-0. He said that everybody was already saying that it's done and they would win. But he himself personally was sure in his plan that he would end up victorious against Dave. So that's why he brought up this example. So it may happen the same. The difference is that Devon is the one usually, you know, comes back stronger every round, you know.
Engin Terzi: that his endurance, it doesn't concern Genadi. Like, Devon's endurance, we always see that, like, at some point of the match, makes his opponents helpless. Does it not concern him, you know? Like, for me, like, I know Genadi has incredible endurance, but he really believes that his endurance is better than Devon's.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Thank you. Yes, thank you very much. I would like to ask you, Genadi, what do you think about the fact that, as you said, there is a lot of use for plutonium. What do you think about the fact that, when a drug is used, the amount of plutonium that is used increases?
Genadi Kvikvinia: yeah and gennady didn't even let me finish he already knew what i was about to translate so and he asked you where and when have you have seen gennady exhausted during armistead have you ever seen him exhausted tired not not tired not tired yeah i mean yeah
Genadi Kvikvinia: He's saying that Devon would not be even better in endurance against Genadi, not even in arm wrestling entirely, not even in football or volleyball or even boxing. Genadi would be better in every aspect. In every aspect, yeah. Okay, I understand, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. And there are two superchats. Can you read? Thank you, Silky Wilkie, because you can directly, just you can read English and also Georgii. From Silky Wilkie's superchat, right? Yeah. Can you read in English as well? Okay. This question goes to Genadi. Do you feel inadequate when facing someone with a bigger thumb than you?
Genadi Kvikvinia: Devon seems to have the girth to intimidate you. Okay. Genadi, I would like to ask you one more question. What do you think is the most appropriate or not? In fact, when you look at yourself, do you think you are a small and massive piece of glass? Yes, a piece of glass. I don't know what to say. A piece of glass is a piece of glass.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Yeah. Judging by his reaction, he's definitely not intimidated by that one. And he said that this stamp is not... Why are people keep saying and talking so much about this stamp? Is this stamp going somewhere else? Or why are we talking about this stamp all the time?
Genadi Kvikvinia: He thinks that thumb is not the decisive factor, so definitely, he's not intimidated. OK, Genadi, . DB Talks, another super chat. Devon's favorite move is the can opener, but will Genadi perform the can opener on Devon?
Genadi Kvikvinia: He said that that's what he's trying to do, to open up Devon's arm like this.
Genadi Kvikvinia: He's planning to take Devon's risk? Yeah, he's planning to take Devon like this, yeah. Wow. So Devon will be like this, not him, not Genadi, but Devon. No, no, I understand. I understand. I said that, sorry. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Silky Wilkie. Thank you, D.B. Tolt, for your support. I think there is one more. Yeah, it's...
Engin Terzi: Thank you very much. They are asking, what does opana mean? Genadi, can you explain what opana means? What does opana mean and what is the meaning of it? For example, when you eat something,
Genadi Kvikvinia: This Georgii way of thinking is very different from the Georgii way of thinking. It is different from the Georgii way of thinking. This Georgii way of thinking is very different from the Georgii way of thinking.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Well, Genadi brought up his childhood example to make it easier for people to understand. He said that
Genadi Kvikvinia: uh back in his childhood he used to uh be a fond of jumping from the heights into the water for instance from the bridges to the rivers or like maybe say there were some pool and like from the height and this adrenaline and stuff and he said that during these times in from his childhood he would uh say those words and it's basically the purpose that that word serves is to encourage him
Genadi Kvikvinia: like it encourages him when he says this opana yeah it kind of gives him more like confidence more like you know gets more enthusiastic whatever he's doing and excited so just the world of world of motivation world of motivation yeah in georgian it doesn't have a specific one minute yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: um engine can you send the link to devon now to surprise gennady uh he has the link but i'm not sure if he's available or not i'm sure he's watching us i'm not sure i don't know i don't know he may be busy he may be busy you know as you know that he injured his thumb and so maybe maybe he's trying to heal that right now yeah
Engin Terzi: what is today's date today's date yeah it's the first april april 1st well today is april 1st oh okay yes wow we are already in april huh i didn't have any intention like time flies so fast yeah i'm wondering about the calendar days yeah yeah anyway so then can you ask him who is he training with
Genadi Kvikvinia: get ready does he do table train i hope he's not only training on the uh with the waist you know yeah uh oh he said rivers rivers
Genadi Kvikvinia: Yeah, he said that Revaz is enough. Samushia as well. For technical aspects, because Vilen is very light.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I don't know how I would have been able to do it if I didn't have the opportunity to do it. I don't know how I would have been able to do it if I didn't have the opportunity to do it. I don't know how I would have been able to do it. I don't know how I would have been able to do it.
Genadi Kvikvinia: All the champions are very talented. For example, Darbyl Sheikha and Darchashvili are very talented, and they work with Magida. They are very talented.
Genadi Kvikvinia: He's saying that those names, like he started by Rezo, technically Rezo is already enough because we know how good Revaz is. But other than Revaz, Samushia, he said, he said Vilani Gabrava as well, Zirakashvili, Irakli, also has joined the crew. He has been already, he worked out twice with Revaz, but Genadi was not there available because he already told us he has to do some business this last one week or so. So he was kind of out and
Genadi Kvikvinia: did not train with them but basically he said that in tbilisi that's the capital i'm sure you already know uh there are like 30 to 35 world champion arm wrestlers already in that city around here yeah yeah and gennady could just whenever he wants whoever he wants he could just call them and press the table training he wants yeah exactly he says yeah yeah and the other day she also
Translator: Tell him to be careful not to injure himself. Tell him to be careful not to injure himself. Tell him to be careful not to injure himself. Tell him to be careful not to injure himself. Tell him to be careful not to injure himself.
Translator: He said that about this thumb, he said that this thumb exercise is actually quite good, but I know that he did not mean enormously when he performed the actions on other people. I understand.
Engin Terzi: uh yeah he he's working out also he's time to make it like deadly you know yeah i i i really train you know but with the tennis ball with the like used tennis balls a little bit softer i really train here um can you ask him where was the shape is it better than last year
Genadi Kvikvinia: I was wondering what happened to the Rehsos. Did you see them all together? Yes, they fought even. The other day they had a war with each other, non-stop.
Genadi Kvikvinia: and next time we see and when rivers is coming to istanbul upcoming match uh you need to have the uh not one door but create the other door next to it because he cannot fit inside so he's really big yeah yeah he's 150 kg right now he got really big 150.
Genadi Kvikvinia: There was a guy named Rezu Makkhilatsona. He was in his 50s. I have a video of him. He was in his 50s. He was in his 50s.
Genadi Kvikvinia: uh the uh the other day he uploaded on his channel gennady uploaded on his channel rezo's video where revas is uh doing curl 140 or 47 kg around that weight like biceps and 120 kg was revaz's limit on that exercise
Genadi Kvikvinia: and now he's like close to one hundred twenty percent increase yeah yeah and basically that that is uh reverse his own weight right now because again he said that everyone has never been over 145 kg and last time he saw him he was 47 kg and then also he said that there was this bicep curling 147 up to so kind of his chronic his own way the question is what does he think that there was a chance against
Genadi Kvikvinia: Dave Chaffee. Oh, what do you think? I'm sorry. I was translating. What do you think, Dave? What do you think?
Genadi Kvikvinia: There was a chance that I would be able to do it. The way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt
Genadi Kvikvinia: It's not in the same form, for example, in the form of Metskhoye and Ukete, and I think that if you look at it, you can see the difference between the two. But Metsmumatebuli is in the form of Metskhoye and Metskhoye is in the form of Metskhoye. It's very interesting.
Genadi Kvikvinia: so uh he said that last time when you asked the same question when we were all together yeah he said 50 50 back then now he's going close to 60 for reverse and the reason he's saying that is that from his match from gennady's match against dave chafee the shape gennady was back then right now would lose against results there was this current shape
Genadi Kvikvinia: But since then, Genadi also gained and got better and stronger. He now is like on tie. So he said that me and Revaz are same. Yeah, they really had a tough war against each other. So he said that Revaz right now is nothing less than me. But since I know that I progressed from Dave Chaffee's match, he knows that that version of Genadi would lose against this Revaz that currently he is sparring.
Genadi Kvikvinia: But he also said that obviously everything is good, but the most important thing is that Revaz should be able to deliver his current shape, as we speak, deliver to the table when it's only matters, you know. So as long as Revaz manages to deliver what he has right now, he thinks 60 to 40% now Revaz is favorite. So basically Revaz is stronger than the time that
Genadi Kvikvinia: he lost against morozov yeah for sure yes yes he he said that uh yeah okay i will re-ask him
Genadi Kvikvinia: In this way, the big fans came together and this was a very big event for Revaz. I can only say that Revaz did not have a very big competition with these fans. Revaz did not compete with the big fans. Revaz won the tournament in Ziritadivarji and won the tournament in Bagirze. To compete with these fans in this professional sport, Revaz was a great sportsman. He was a great athlete, but he lost.
Genadi Kvikvinia: So Revaz' mistake what occurred against Morozo was that preparation like one week before the match Revaz did very extremely heavy weight lifting and that was the mistake and he did not have enough time to rest so basically resting was not enough and
Genadi Kvikvinia: Usually Rivas is not doing such a heavyweight pulling and Rivas is not used to do that. So he's not kind of experienced about that. And right now, as he gets better and better, Rivas gets better and better, he also kind of threatens to entire Georgii crew who spars with him.
Genadi Kvikvinia: because he's getting better at weightlifting now he's getting more experience he knows what to do better than previously and Revaz used to be lazy or lazier uh athlete than he is now he got even more motivated since he's versus West and that's why he thinks that Revaz is gonna be for sure in better shape this time than last time we saw him I guess another question like to all the strongest
Engin Terzi: super heavyweights are Genadi and Rewas. The question, just a question, I know they are friends, they don't want to say anything that would disturb each other, but to them, to their understanding, is Levan unreachable for their minds, for themselves?
Genadi Kvikvinia: It is interesting to note that Sheno and Revaz are the same, because the two titans in these superzones are very similar.
Genadi Kvikvinia: And how do you think you can help Lebanon? How do you think you can work with Lebanon? I don't know exactly. I don't know how to work with Lebanon. I don't know how to work with Lebanon. I don't know how to work with Lebanon. I don't know how to work with Lebanon. I don't know how to work with Lebanon. I don't know how to work with Lebanon.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to
Genadi Kvikvinia: So he can only speak about himself and not from Revaz's perspective. So that question only he answers from his side. Revaz can obviously tell his side in future.
Genadi Kvikvinia: So he's saying that, and he kept always saying, Genadi kept always saying about him versus Levan, that Levan is not that much unreachable for him personally. He knows how to beat him. But since they are very good friends with each other, he first of all respects, he's his countryman, he's his good friend. He has reached so much higher level in this sport. He's a leader, true leader right now all around.
Genadi Kvikvinia: And he has nothing but respect as an athlete to athlete about that one. And then as they are friends, it is awkward for Genadi to claim that he can beat Levan. But he's saying that if he gets six months, let's say, give it or take, six months of preparation for Levan, he thinks that he could beat Levan if everything is perfect.
Genadi Kvikvinia: okay so he said that levan is eventually beatable because everybody is beatable no one is unbeatable everyone has at some point what type of some some weakest links you know so yeah but but right now he cannot say it it's awkward he he knows it's not right to say that he can beat levan he says that basically levan is the best right now but there is no reason that he shouldn't believe in himself against anyone
Genadi Kvikvinia: is this what you're saying yes yeah but personally if he if kennedy has good enough time six months let's say he gives himself as chance against leon as well yeah there is another super chat digging digging it's all gonna be he said that if if i beat them if i beat them on larat
Engin Terzi: Oh, actually, he didn't say if. I have to correct myself. He said, when I beat Devon Larratt, set me up the match against Levan. I will show. We will go one by one. I just wanted to see how they think. Like, psychologically, oh, it's Levan. No, we cannot beat him. Or they really believe that there is a possibility for them to reach to the top. So he is saying that after he beats Devon, he doesn't even say if.
Genadi Kvikvinia: So this guy really believes that May 6th will be probably the end of Devon's dream to become a super heavyweight world champion.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Devon said that he would never go heavier than 115 kg, but then he also kind of said that, well, he can still try himself against Revaz, but...
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Tevo should not pull Georgii because outcome will be all the time the same. Just try to find some other opponents. I understand. There is a question. Dig in, dig in it. Thank you for your support. For Genadi, have you improved since your Hermes battle? Sorry, Engin. I was reading the chat. He's asking that if Genadi improved since his Hermes match.
Genadi Kvikvinia: How did you and Hermes meet? No, it's not your turn. It was my first meeting with you, right?
Genadi Kvikvinia: I don't think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition.
Genadi Kvikvinia: These two shapes, like Genadi's current shape and Genadi's shape versus Nermes is practically incomparable because the gap is significant, very big. Right now, Genadi is way stronger, better.
Genadi Kvikvinia: than he was against Hermes. And he said that, I'm not going to say I was not in shape against Hermes. Obviously I was, I was prepared. He said, the only issue he said that possibly it was that he got like only four days rest time, but that's like possible. Some people get more or less, but he said that he was in good shape against Hermes, but he lost.
Genadi Kvikvinia: And this time, it's incomparable because his current shape, even from Ferit's match, he versus Ferit, so in January, he's got even better right now as we speak. So, incomparable shapes. Yeah, there is another super chat. Thank you, my friend, for your super chat. Will you be afraid since Devon is so much taller than you, like Grevas? Also, what should Devon be worried about from you?
Genadi Kvikvinia: What is your best weapon that you will prove to him in the match? Like first question you ask, maybe let's go one by one. Okay. Is he gonna be afraid that Devon is much taller than him? Genadi, I would like to say that Genadi, as you said, is older than Devon. He is older than Devon.
Genadi Kvikvinia: He's going to shorten them, shorten him.
Genadi Kvikvinia: ah he brought his uh example uh with the reverse he said that when i when we me and devon put arms like this like elbow pad and like this maybe like like like this or maybe even he's saying that maybe not even uh that much taller because he versus rivers is quite saying that's what he said yeah i understand yeah another question is what should devon
Genadi Kvikvinia: I'm worried about Genadi. Do you think you're going to be angry and nervous about Devon? If you're going to talk about Devon. No, I'm not going to be angry. I'm going to be angry with you. What are you going to do? What am I going to do? I'm going to make a deal with you. I'm going to make a deal with you.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I was born in the mid-1980s, and I was born in the mid-1980s. I don't have a lot of experience, but I know how to do it. I know how to do it, and I know how to do it. I don't have a lot of experience, but I know how to do it. I don't have a lot of experience, but I know how to do it. I don't have a lot of experience, but I know how to do it. I know how to do it.
Genadi Kvikvinia: The ball is our technique, the ball is our technique, the ball is our technique. For example, Michael Dodi is here, Kingsmoos is here, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on,
Genadi Kvikvinia: So he said that basically Devon should be worried about everything that Genadi could be delivering against him. But then I asked him, come on, give me some more specific answers. And he said that first of all, Devon is slower than I am. That's what Genadi said. So speed. Second of all, I'm stronger than him. That's okay. Speed and strength. Then he also said that the surges, these heats that I can do, that's also...
Genadi Kvikvinia: He's doing that better than Devon can do. So these are three. He also said that endurance, we are quite same. He said that he did not say that I'm better or something like that. He said that endurance wise, we could be same. But since I'm stronger, he knows he's stronger. He assumes that who gets tired, if the endurance is same and I'm stronger, obviously Devon will get tired sooner than I am. That's what he said.
Genadi Kvikvinia: And another thing, he also brought the example of Michael Todd. He said that Devon has never pulled such a versatile armwrestler like I am. And he said that he, Genadi himself, is no any less technical as Devon. And he said that I can pull in every position possible. That's what Genadi said. And he repeated himself.
Genadi Kvikvinia: uh like against michael todd devon and mike they both were in king's move and they were resting in there staying in there and eventually somebody got so tired and the other one won but he said that i'm not michael todd has never faced anyone like uh me because i'm as strong and as versatile as i am gennady's devon's opponent has never been such as such an opponent for devon so
Engin Terzi: uh that's those are four things major things that they should be worried about so i understand arm wrestling experiment thank you for your support why doesn't gennady train with levan they are number one and number two of georgia after all also is your instagram account john engen yes my friend thanks i thank you for your support so he is asking
Genadi Kvikvinia: They are the two best guys in Georgii. Why did they not train together? Him and Lewan, right? Genadi, what do you and Lewan have to say about each other? What do you think about sparring? It's a very important moment.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I know that this is my private business, this is my private business, and I would like to say that I am very happy to be here with you. I am very happy to be here with you. I am very happy to be here with you. I am very happy to be here with you. I am very happy to be here with you.
Genadi Kvikvinia: That's how it started. I didn't want to go to war. I wanted to go to war with my friends. I wanted to go to war with my friends. I didn't want to go to war with my friends. I didn't want to go to war with my friends. I didn't want to go to war with my friends. I didn't want to go to war with my friends.
Genadi Kvikvinia: uh main reason he said uh why he and levan cannot uh do table time sparring each other is that
Genadi Kvikvinia: the time uh arrangements he said that uh lebanon is basically concentrated on armless link and i have some other businesses he already mentioned several times today's live stream and i have some other uh like things to take care of during the daytime and what leon is doing during the data daytime is that basically he is training and he just said that right now after after this live stream is done he's about to go train gennady but right now as we speak lebanon is already done training
Genadi Kvikvinia: so that's the reason why he cannot train with uh and he said that but sleeping time he has enough sleep because he sleeps he wakes up quite late like 11 a.m or so and so sleeping is okay but he has such a tired schedule for training that's why i understand uh okay this guy is asking devon has bigger hands would it affect gennady
Engin Terzi: uh okay okay i mean normally normally i mean he even pull against levan before i don't think that the size of devon's hand will be something like new for uh all right
Genadi Kvikvinia: Genadi, in general, it is very difficult. It is not very difficult, but sometimes it is very difficult, Genadi, and sometimes it is not comfortable, and sometimes it is difficult. And I think that... Well, Levan Bacho Saginashvili is very difficult, because Levan Bacho Saginashvili was my competitor, and I was in the same class with him.
Genadi Kvikvinia: As a matter of fact, I don't know what it means. I don't know what it means. I don't know what it means. I don't know what it means. I don't know what it means.
Genadi Kvikvinia: When I translated and I also started to translate what you said about him versus Levan,
Genadi Kvikvinia: he actually kind of interrupted and said himself that he finished my words so he said that throughout the history we all know he has faced lebanon and lebanon's hand the devil's hand is uh not as big as lebanon's obviously and he said that uh during his entire career
Genadi Kvikvinia: if he has any, any concurrent and like opponent at his level in armwrestling, all of them has relatively bigger hands than Genadi himself. So he got used to train against armwrestling against such bigger hands. And he said that also, the bigger hand is the more technical wise, you can perform against them even more.
Engin Terzi: and he said that if hand is smaller you cannot perform so much technique actions on those so he's he feels quite comfortable yeah yeah and now we're closing before we close i would like to ask him what does he think about east versus west as an event in general right i mean what does he think you know like generally
Genadi Kvikvinia: Genadi, thank you very much for your time. Thank you very much for your interest. What do you think about East vs. West? What do you think will happen in this event? First of all, I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be part of the group of new artists and to be part of the group of new artists.
Genadi Kvikvinia: First of all, Enkin, you are doing an amazing job. What you are doing and what you have done to give birth to such an event as East versus West, it is very effective in my country. I mean, in Georgii, he said that more and more young people are
Genadi Kvikvinia: have gotten interested into the sport and joined the club so he just wanted me to translate this and then he will carry on so your what you have done popularized the event way more gandhal again uh
Genadi Kvikvinia: and the accent is very clear, and it is very clear, because this is, let's say, the first interest of many people, and the people love it. This is a very large population of Klausidiství, and this is a very large part of Klausidiství, a very large part of Klausidiství, let's say, this interest is present.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I would like to thank Engini, Klavchidi, Zoga, sportsmen, and Tavish for this opportunity. It's a great show and sport is a very important part of the country.
Genadi Kvikvinia: I was very impressed by this, because I, as a young man, am a sportsman, and I know that there is no doubt about it. There are people with disabilities, with disabilities, with disabilities, with disabilities,
Genadi Kvikvinia: This is why our popularity is so high. This tournament is popular all over the world. From here, you can go to the center of all sports. This is very important. And this movement continues. From our point of view, the most important thing is that all sportsmen are involved.
Genadi Kvikvinia: and his second part of his answer was based on his first answer that first part that he said that it got more popular and more so much more people are recognizing this event and from this event got aware of the sport as it is arm wrestling and so much more people are asking him personally if he is preparing who is against uh with next time and everybody are involved in this sport
Genadi Kvikvinia: from this event and he said that other than popularization generally speaking and in future long term speaking this is extremely uh great uh for armwrestling itself because it takes into the uh levels that has honestly never been before he said that it is very hard to have a elite uh event and also entertaining and uh
Genadi Kvikvinia: again you managed to do this and he thanked you for that one he also said that so many so many matches that are within the one event makes it even more exciting you know one match is interesting then the other comes it is very interesting and so on and so forth it continues so it it is very extremely interesting as so much matches to you you have on during the one event he also said that uh
Genadi Kvikvinia: um this elite level also has never been reached because pop top guys are from all over the world and right now today gennady is very proud to say that he is arm wrestling arm wrestler because whatever he says about that that's my goal my friend that's my goal he just
Genadi Kvikvinia: yeah whenever he's he he said that i'm very proud to be arm wrestler because wherever i say i'm arm wrestler everybody talks about this versus quest in my country everybody recognizes that and more people joined arm wrestling and he said that you keep up the good job and this will uh bring the sport in the level that it truly deserves yeah tell him that those are our superstars and they deserve much better than this
Genadi Kvikvinia: Genadi, I would like to say that this is my opinion, and my opinion is that you are a Georgii and you are a native, and you know very well that you are going to lose weight, and you will be able to do this sport as much as possible.
Genadi Kvikvinia: It is a big challenge, and from our point of view, I would like to say that this is my private business, and I am very happy that I was able to come here and open two stores.
Genadi Kvikvinia: This is my exclusive video of Trekking Trash, and I have my own video of it. This is the first time I've seen it, and I've never seen it before, but it's not a big deal. I've never seen a video like this before. I've never seen it before. I've never seen it before. I've never seen it before. I've never seen it before. I've never seen it before. I've never seen it before. I've never seen it before.
Genadi Kvikvinia: From our point of view, all sportsmen are active, not just me, Devon, Revaz, and so on. All of them are active because this person is a real example of what can be done and we are the first to know if we are active in sports.
Genadi Kvikvinia: All the sportsmen were active and all the participants were the same. If you watch our videos, you will see that it is very short and you will see Klaus Chidistu's face and what he did. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same.
Genadi Kvikvinia: All right. He also thanked you for your words that you said. And he said that from our perspective as armistice lawyers,
Genadi Kvikvinia: we will do as much as we possibly can to uh get this also very popular promote it and also help armisting to grow and reach bigger levels he said that personally as of right now he had like some last 10 days had some personal uh things to take care of but right now he tells his fans he's telling people who are watching us right now guys uh be ready that uh and gennady will upload
Genadi Kvikvinia: uh constantly videos on his channel about his preparation versus them just wanted to make uh wanted me to tell he tell you this uh and he then he started to talk to the audience from arm wrestling arm wrestler arm wrestler audience that are watching us right now he said that every arm wrestler who is uh having a common sense
Genadi Kvikvinia: to be promoting this sport and helping you, Engin, because this, what we are doing, we are doing it together. Engin is not only one guy in this sport. Engin needs people who are also sharing the same mind. And he said that the reason why I'm saying this is because this is good for us. That's what Genadi said, good for us armwrestlers as well. That's why he mentioned these words TORS to armwrestlers.
Genadi Kvikvinia: uh other competitors as well so they all need to get together and promote this event share videos upload videos re-share them and get it more and more going this action and then also he said the same thing to fans as well whoever you if you are his fan cannot be spent Devon's fan or all around arm wrestling fan you should be doing the same promote share and uh keep the sport grow
Engin Terzi: yeah thank you there are lots of superchats i will read and then we will close silky milky my friend thank you for your very generous uh superchats my friends sg roman thank you for your translations today and helping the fans to know what the east competitors are feeling going into the match this is for you also thank you engin and genadi so much for the discussion
Engin Terzi: Thank you, my friend. Thank you for your support. Thank you. There was one more. Yeah, right here. Sidelines start. Genadi, what will it mean to prove all your supporters right and come back home with a win? Like, did you understand? I kind of understand, but what's the... What will it...
Genadi Kvikvinia: what will it mean to prove all your supporters right and come back home with a win what will it mean to prove right what it will mean what will it mean to prove yeah yeah yeah okay uh uh
Genadi Kvikvinia: What does this mean, how does it work? It means that we are going to have a meeting on the 6th of May and we are going to have a discussion. How does this work and what does it mean to you? Let's see.
Genadi Kvikvinia: Well, the principle is the same as mine and Devon's, because there are so many people, for example, in Devon's book, who say that I have a chance, that I am going to win this time. I don't think so, because I don't have a chance. I had this from my childhood, and I always thought that I was going to win this time. And I am going to win this time, and this is going to happen to my Georgii,
Genadi Kvikvinia: As you can see, my contribution to Georgii is a symbol of the fact that Georgii is no longer with us. All of this is the result of my commitment to the people. I was not able to do it with Klavchid, but Klavchid is everything to me. With Klavchid, I was able to say that this is what I want, this is what I want, and this is what I want. My contribution to the country.
Genadi Kvikvinia: It is clear that I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it
Genadi Kvikvinia: uh he started by saying that personally this victory that he will bring back to home will mean everything for him and for his country it will be one big step towards to the greatness he said that for him armis link has never been the source of to become a reach or to become a material wealth
Genadi Kvikvinia: uh this is the feeling that he has from this sport that drives him motivates him and keeps him uh focused on get out there bring the bring the flag of his country put it there and said that this is where i'm coming from this is my country and this is how good we are so he as a patriot uh um said that it means everything for him to go out there and win against devon
Genadi Kvikvinia: and when he comes back for his people around him and from georgians it he knows that it would mean also a lot and it would be a very big step towards to the uh uh greater um future yeah basically that's what he said very very important for him basically my friends thank you very much i wish you good luck
Engin Terzi: Devon is also my friend. I wish him good luck too. Engin, you will see what his arm will do. He said thank you and he will prove this arm to you. Wow. I think he's just coming there without any doubt that he's going to win. While Devon also feels that way, it will be, how do you say, a clash of titans? Wow. It will be. Mentally,
Engin Terzi: two very very strong guys spiritually their heart very very strong they both are probably the most versatile arm masters on the earth i just can't imagine what's going to happen on the table wow i don't know how you managed to set this up but yeah i mean yeah i will set it up i will set it up as long as as long as you are missing sports
Engin Terzi: I will continue setting up and I will just focus on arm wrestling, nothing else. Thank you, thank you, thank you Genadi and thank you Roman, my friend. See you in Istanbul.
Engin Terzi: okay take care yeah thank you guys thank you for watching us see you guys next time
