Engin Terzi: Hello, Irfan Ramazan, Walt, Pulseo TV, Galatso, Gabriela, Gabriele, Mu, Murma, Alan, Elaine, Life of Iron, Mario, Andreev, Adnan, Mateo, Pulseo, Andreev. Hello, guys. Hello.
Engin Terzi: pride and prejudice hello hello hello what's up how are you you you heard me or not i i hear you okay yeah yeah just a little bit up so that i can see your head totally instead of here yeah yeah so how have you been it's too much bigger too big my hair yes yes you are you are just like almost levan size now
Ermes Gasparini: Like a boy. Yeah. How are you, Hermes? I'm fine. My training is going very good. Yeah, I saw the lifting. My friend, you are very smart. Why? You show the difference of my lift and the...
Ermes Gasparini: and the other guys. Yeah, but I didn't say such thing. When did I say that I saw difference? Because it's the first time, but I don't this lift, but it's not completely cold because like this is more difficult. Yes. Because it's only
Ermes Gasparini: understand only yeah yeah yeah it's better you going go down with the elbow yeah yeah a lot of people are lifting when the cable is belt is coming like like like this yeah and then you lift like this yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: know whenever whenever anything you are lifting from the ground this needs to start parallel and then whenever you lift it needs to be a little bit like this instead of your whole the belt is hanging here and then you go underneath and then lifting like this yeah you are you are in fact a little bit deceiving yourself and yeah i mean we can talk about it but i know what it is
Ermes Gasparini: But the weight, my friend, is not very important. I mean, yeah. If you see, like, Irakli, sometimes he lifts more than Lewand, but on the table he loses very easily with Lewand. You understand? This and this are more important than this. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: everything is important but yes but but again you know you need to arm muscle with your hand and wrist you know not like this this is important but now you're not going to lift anybody's elbow from the pad you know you cannot depend there you need to depend on controlling your opponent and yeah and then the guy so you you are probably at your strongest ever right correct i hope my friend
Engin Terzi: Oh yeah. You remember, I wrote to you one day, the one guy wrote that Ermes doesn't believe that he can beat Levan and he made a video. And then I wrote to you, I said, did you really say such thing? And you say like, never. And then you said, I know I can believe. I know I can beat Levan. You said, yeah, whenever you say publicly to everyone,
Engin Terzi: People may think that you are pretending, but you said this directly to me. You understand? There was nobody. You said, Engin, I know I can beat Levan. So that is a good thing. It doesn't mean you're going to win 100%, but it means that you are going there to win. And some people may not understand, but you did not come to this point because of money, because of anything else, because you had a dream.
Engin Terzi: You still have a dream. And the February 25th, I don't know what the result will be. It looks favorite for sure. But you, that is your dream. And this is the final part of your dream. The final of the game. Between your dream and yourself, only there is Levan. It's a big challenge, huge challenge. But that is your dream. And I am 100% sure when you go to bat,
Ermes Gasparini: Before you sleep, you are not thinking about paycheck. You are thinking, dreaming only about being in Levan. Correct? Yeah? Yes? Yeah, because during of the day, I think about the future. You understand?
Ermes Gasparini: I think about the moment of the fight, the setup, everything. If I think like this, I'm already prepared for this. My mind is already prepared for this moment. You need to have everything in your mind. It doesn't mean that you're going to win 100%, but
Engin Terzi: that has to you know if you don't have this mindset for sure you are not gonna win yeah but for for for everybody like these like these not only for lebanon is in the chat yeah yeah tell that italian that i'm gonna break his bones i'm joking
Engin Terzi: It's a big challenge. But I always tell Ermes, LeJuan is number one, and there is no doubt. And he needs to pull someone. And if there is a person that deserves to pull against him, I can say that it's you. After your performance against Dave Sheffy, Dave Sheffy is a superhuman being. He's an incredibly strong guy. And you two win against him 3-0, it just proves that, you know,
Ermes Gasparini: like dave cheffy is the the gatekeeper before someone can reach to yeah yeah the one yeah because some people uh right to here to be too much is too difficult zero chance and six zero for lewa etc but who can who can go with live now
Engin Terzi: Tell me, who can go? I mean, there are a few names. Maybe it's Zahur, but we don't know where is his level. Right now, it's you. Right now, it's you, Ermes. Right now, it's you. It doesn't mean that you are the only one who should try against him, but you, for sure, deserve to be the one to try against the one before anyone else. So, that's what it is. And you have your chance on
Engin Terzi: February 25 you can do it, you cannot do it, I don't know, is it possible I don't know anything is possible. If you're possibly to to win does it look more than 11 no it doesn't look more than 11 but just whenever you just go and check all the polls yesterday I said this when I had Dennis.
Engin Terzi: Like, there has been many, many matches that the pole showed opposite weight. One is winning 90%, other one 10%, and then it just happened the opposite way. Like, when I did the Barbara versus Gabriela, I mean, like, Gabriela was... But before the fight, I compared the size of the bodyweight size. Mm-hmm.
Engin Terzi: there are a lot of difference between barbara but not not every woman that has the barbara size can be gabriella i don't think there is any other human being right now that has chance to beat gabriella i mean i can bring you even a bigger woman than barbara but it doesn't mean that she's gonna beat gabriella and if you want the first two matches you know when you are going to have weight there is no weight limit you know maybe maybe gabriella he she need
Ermes Gasparini: more endurance in the hand because if you remember with sarah buckman the last fight she lost something yeah she lost something in the her hand yeah do you think that there should be a revenge match because i told gabriella whenever she wants she is ready
Engin Terzi: training he she training more his hand or his hand to run and I think she will win yeah somebody is asking is Hermes going to try what Devon tried example taking advantage of the rules and intentionally foul to tire Levan doing the the
Engin Terzi: like open arm top roll or something. I don't think that, I don't think, you know, guys, um, Hermes has different mentality. If Hermes would try to do something that like he never trained for, and even to spend time
Engin Terzi: or something else, I think is going to make Hermes' performance down. Hermes is going to do what Hermes has been doing. Correct, Hermes? Yeah, I got it. You don't need to copy anyone. No, no, no. You didn't come to this level by copying someone else. You are Hermes. That is Devon. Devon is himself. Hermes is himself. Devon is himself. Nobody. I mean, they all walk on the way that they believe. This is what I believe.
Unknown: Pretty different styles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and so what's the plan? I will broke his head. And then you, I'm very, believe me, I'm very super curious to, to,
Ermes Gasparini: to see the outcome and feel I'm super cool to feel this power yeah but we don't know maybe maybe my style is very bad for him who knows who knows where you are attacking
Ermes Gasparini: You are like this. Because my style is completely different from Laletin's. Because I think if Laletin, when he fought with Lewa, he lost because he reached too much down, too down like this. But with my style, completely different. We see, my friend. You know, Laletin, you know, very tall forearm.
Engin Terzi: And he's doing the low hand top roll like this. And when Levan went there, he couldn't. But then he went back and rise up and then take his wrist. And then against Devon, Levan first tried what he tried against Devon and Laletin after the first start. He went totally out and then he was like this with, you know, with against Devon. And then he realized that he needs to go sideways in the second round. He went more like to sideways instead of pulling top roll.
Ermes Gasparini: And so I think with you, I don't know if he's going to go this out or he will go this sideway. I don't know. We don't know. We see. I think I'm curious to put Dave with the to look at Dave now this shape.
Ermes Gasparini: With the strap, which... Against Lewand? Because I think, I think, I don't know, it's only my opinion. I think only the side pressure of Dave, only side pressure, we have more than Lewand. So you are saying that Lewand is more dangerous? Lewand is more stronger here, no? Backside? Yes, backside like this.
Ermes Gasparini: But I think Dave only with the side pressure. More side pressure you are saying, yeah. Yeah, I think it's more dangerous than Levan. But when they fought together, he took his wish and he couldn't do that. Do you think that you will be able to manage to go to strap with Levan? What do you mean?
Ermes Gasparini: Like, do you think that you will be able to sleep? No, no, I want to, I wanted to pull normally. I wanted to maybe without the strap, 99, 99, 99% we will, the match will go to the strap. Sure.
Engin Terzi: i think but but you know it is not that easy to sleep from the hands of uh level do you think there is any risk like that or no we see my friend no i mean do you think that like do you do you see your chance higher in the strap or higher about who do we like do you have more chance in the step or without step to win
Engin Terzi: uh if i win uh i'm sure there aren't the straps because it's important you realize that you know levan sometimes doesn't allow his opponent to go his hand control everything is good do you think that there is a danger for you to not to be able to uh go to trap
Ermes Gasparini: uh sorry about the connection i'm not very good i stopped it before oh okay um okay can you turn just just one second yeah okay you hear me well yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: okay so i'm just saying that do you have any and do you think there is any dangers that danger that you may not be able to go manage to go strapped against the one okay guys the problem is with my connection of the air message connection here
Engin Terzi: I'm just asking people if my connection is bad or, oh, oh, they say it's Hermes. Your connection is with Hermes, they say. Yeah. Maybe now it's good. I hope so. Yeah. See?
Engin Terzi: Everyone says that Ermes is a problematic person. Will I change? I mean, you are a little bit like getting caught. Do you hear me well or not? Huh? Do you hear me? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so I just say that
Ermes Gasparini: A moment, I change. We go with the with the phone. Okay.
Unknown: Okay, guys, I ask you guys, do you guys think that Hermes will have any problems to manage going step? Okay, now you hear me? Yeah, yeah, now. Okay, okay, okay. I'm just asking that normally Levan has very good hand control.
Ermes Gasparini: As you saw, he did not allow Dave Sheffield to go to strap all six rounds. Do you think there is a possibility that you may be in danger to manage to go to strap? No. No? Well, okay. Impossible. Impossible, okay. This is impossible. Okay, so... If he can take my hand and my wrist like this, he's...
Ermes Gasparini: absolutely animals because never controlling your arm you know no because if he will take my wrist like this uh his hand is double double he have a double power than me minimal well why double double power if you're i mean if he is okay you left again
Ermes Gasparini: No, I think they changed the rule, the 30 seconds rule. Guys, do you guys think that, you know, Hermes may have problems to go to a strap or no? Okay, now it's perfect. Okay. Okay. I say that if he take my wrist and it will go down without straps. Mm-hmm.
Engin Terzi: is impossible in my mind to think like this yeah he is he's not gonna take your hand to to just more like control your arm so it's not possible this is completely impossible okay i have a question for you you are of course going there to win for sure but can you at least give us a promise that
Engin Terzi: The last one will not be continued. It's 6-0. I will win. Minimum one out. You promise that? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Good, good, good, good, good. So you are going there to win him, win against him. My friend, if you go with your mind to lose, it's better to stay at home and don't compete. No, no, no, no, no. What I'm just saying is that you're going there to beat him minimum four rounds. Minimum four? Yeah, but you are saying that if something happens, the worst case,
Engin Terzi: will have his one round lost yeah yeah yeah yeah that part so what you are saying that beating him four rounds is your goal and you're gonna do it but if just say that if it is not possible but you say that winning not even one round is impossible no
Engin Terzi: okay that's good that's good just get him get him and then hey listen my offer is still there you know you give me 20 i come to your corner hey guys this is only joke some people takes it seriously that engine is really asking don't take it seriously because some people make weird jokes you know
Engin Terzi: yeah i may go there i may be at his corner but not what is wrong with your internet my friend what is wrong you are still frozen again yeah okay you you look like you know you went to the um okay england's questions is always so strange i will make sure that you won't be dealing with the strange questions anymore yeah
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so what's wrong with your internet? Why are you all the time frozen? What? Your internet. I think your internet is not good because now I changed completely the connections. Maybe the place in your apartment or house is maybe a place to
Engin Terzi: yeah okay guys still his internet or my internet because before i had a wi-fi now i have a normal connection with the telephone this is impossible yeah yeah interesting because to me no everyone is still saying this air message internet
Engin Terzi: See? No, no. It is Hermes' problem. Hermes' leg. See, they are saying that... Seriously. No, everyone is saying... They are saying that Hermes intentionally so that he wouldn't answer the questions. Yeah. Yeah. You do that intentionally, right? No, my friend. Yeah. Hermes freezing, not Engin.
Engin Terzi: because much power here they connect so your power is affecting the internet connection yeah let's see the power look look at that look let me look how's this how about bicep ah
Engin Terzi: He's 54. What's your weight? Still 131, like this. 131, yeah. It doesn't really matter how big you are. The important thing is the quality. Quality, my friend.
Ermes Gasparini: I think if I want, I can go like 140 kilos. Every time I eat like McDonald's or I don't know, hamburger, but there is no good for health, for your body, for your everything. Maybe I will go down then.
Engin Terzi: more you have less power then you understand i understand yeah i understand yeah so next time next time when you come to the east versus west you will be the number one guy in the world yeah yeah and are you are you going to uh
Engin Terzi: give your shield to uh levan if he wins because he's gonna give you the hammer if you win but my shield where is it it's in istanbul you left so that every time you come you don't have to go and bring it yeah so you're gonna you're gonna so he puts the hammer you put the shields yes i want the hammer
Engin Terzi: you want the hammer and then very beautiful the armor yeah yeah but if he wins then the shield also goes right to him i don't know i don't know the rules there is nothing wrong but are you he is confident enough to put the hammer are you confident enough to put the shield yeah yeah i put i put everything okay okay everything yeah okay
Ermes Gasparini: yeah that's good but now there are the the this is saturday they won't be saying this yeah i think yes yeah yeah i said it's very strong huh yeah you you you you think he's gonna be seven no no
Ermes Gasparini: Because Devon, I think he will go in the king move and the endurance of Sanders will go down. It will be a very good match, but I don't know. I think Devon will win, yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: You know, Devon, he will go only if he is 100% sure to win. More or less. Okay. So if Devon ever pulls against you, it means that he will think that he will beat you 100%? No, because in one year he doesn't have an agreement with me. The other day I saw... He doesn't want...
Ermes Gasparini: The other day I saw on the internet that Zaur says that he has a match with you. Yeah. Davit Chaffee, he wants Davit Chaffee too. I saw the post of Davit Chaffee. He wrote he has a match soon like this. I don't know.
Engin Terzi: don't know no but but but but i am not going to i'm not going to announce the matches of the east versus west seven but both of those guys will be in this event both dave and zal will be at east versus seven nice but but not not not against each other yeah
Engin Terzi: They will be sad. What's that? They will who? Who can go with who? I don't know. Maybe with Denis Diplenko. I don't think Denis is going to put anyone after John till October. October? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Denis Diplenko will be at the East Ursus West 9 in October. Oh, 7 is in May. 7 May, and then we have one in July, end of July, and then the other one will be in October. 7 May, 8 in July. End of July, yeah. End of July. Yeah. And then October.
Engin Terzi: And there's another thing going on between... There is no reason, my friend. Today I will release it. No need to be paranoid, you know. Arun, thank you for your support, my friend. Yeah. And there is another thing going on between Jerry and Devon.
Ermes Gasparini: And me too. He wants to make a double fight with Genadi. Why? You know why he wants to compete with Genadi. Because he knows he will lose.
Ermes Gasparini: maybe someone he helped him to win something you understand okay okay one thing i don't understand he wants to pull gennady he says jerry said this jerry shade in the video on his youtube he wanted to pull with me and the devil two and two jerry and the gennady
Ermes Gasparini: and me and Devon. And the first match is maybe Arif with me. Second match, Genadi with Devon. Third match, Arif with Devon, me with Genadi, who have six victories, win all the matches.
Ermes Gasparini: Okay. I don't understand. Maybe he drank too much. That kind of format is not going to happen in my event anyways. Devon, he will beat him, sure. You think Devon will beat Gerrard? Sure, my friend. Because if you know his style, it's very easy to beat him.
Ermes Gasparini: So he is going to be... Georgii, when he was down like this, if he used a little press, he won, sure, 3-0. But he didn't try, right? Yeah, because maybe for the size, maybe it's too big for this technique, I don't know. I don't know. There is a super shit Todd and Oleg Lovechild, one legend.
Engin Terzi: and his little brother we love you both so thank you yeah he he calls you legend and then he calls me little brother anyway so yeah okay so so you are saying that jerry would lose against devon 100 jerry wants to pull against levan
Engin Terzi: who do you if if jerry beats listen if jerry beats devon does he deserve a shot against levan no if he beats him no no because if you put dave with jerry david he will win super easy so you are saying that jerry needs to beat everyone to pull
Ermes Gasparini: The one? He won only with the, only one, he won one, two times. Okay, but but if he also beats Devon? The good, the good ...
Engin Terzi: but they won in the 150 kilo or more no no more more it's heavyweight okay so if jerry beats devon then we should say that yesterday you deserve to pull against lebanon yeah yeah because because you also didn't pull everyone you pull they'll take you okay very very strong guy but also gennady head means against dave
Engin Terzi: Morozov had win again. The difference is that you won right from the first round. You won all three rounds. But yeah, but but Gary Gary doesn't have to beat everyone, right? Yeah, he needed to win another match. Big match. I mean, he beat Genadi. Like Dave Chaffee, Devon or
Ermes Gasparini: I don't know. Do you think that Jerry doesn't have a chance at all against Devon? Zero chance. Zero chance? Zero. Okay. Because Devon is very smart to block his movement. So you think he's going to do the shoulder pressure? Yeah, he blocks everything.
Ermes Gasparini: If Devon goes offside, then Jerry has a chance? More chance. But I don't think Devon will go in the top row. I understand. But it will be a very beautiful match, sure. But if he does the shoulder pressure and if he catches Jerry here,
Engin Terzi: I don't think that he would be good, but if Jerry gets the center and puts Devon in a bad position, then I think he will be long. Yes, but Devon will have very good endurance. For me, he will win, sure. For me, it's a very close match.
Engin Terzi: I mean, if somehow Devon can't get the center, and then if Jerry catch him here, and then here is the Devon position, I don't think it will be that easy. With Davit Sheffy? Davit Sheffy, listen.
Engin Terzi: We talk about Dave Chappie all the time that we who had the wrist and the more like hell hook, dragon hook. Now Jerry is more attacking like, not Jerry, Dave. Dave is attacking more like pronators. When you over pronate, sometimes it is problematic about this. All day was really like hurling and then like move inside. The new one is too much pronating and going outside. It may be, may be problematic, may be.
Ermes Gasparini: I don't know. But yeah, with Devon it was a very good match, I think. But I don't think Jerry accepted the match with Devon because he knows... Jerry knows that he cannot beat Devon? Yeah. So he will reject that fight? Yeah, because now...
Ermes Gasparini: He already put some video. I'm different category. You are not in top 10. I'm number two. You are like me, like Fiat. And Devon like Fiat. And Devon... I don't know all the cars.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but the Fiat is not the most well-known car. It's like there are like some different Italian cars, right? Can you remind us of other cars? Lamborghini, Ferrari is better than Fiat, my friend. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So how do you describe yourself? What? Which one is you? What are you?
Ermes Gasparini: Lamborghini? Yeah, two Lamborghini and one Ferrari. You are two Lamborghini and one Ferrari. Yeah, every time when I want in your east versus west, I have a big money to buy this. Come on, I told you not to tell this to other people. It's between us. Why you tell people this? Come on. No, from now I will give you bicycle. Sorry.
Engin Terzi: anyways so you are you are saying that you are saying that jerry says that uh you are out of top 10 or devon is out of the table oh he says that devon is out of top 10. how about you you third after the third oh okay okay i understand and another question how about you and zaur
Ermes Gasparini: uh uh so very very strong guys uh he wrote to me in the private chat and this good guy is no there are no hate no there is no need to be no no and
Ermes Gasparini: I think now I want to see the next event in Russia because Laletin came back. Maybe in good shape. And I want to see... I hope they meet in the first round fresh to fresh.
Engin Terzi: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because in the tournament it's very difficult. Yeah, but whenever Irakli and Slav match, the match was tough. But this event, when Slav and... Yeah, but because Zaur is very strong here. Listen, Slav look even bigger than ever, but still Zaur beating like this. Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: Yes, because when he loses his wrist, it will go down very easily. But with Lallit in a different situation. I think the endurance of Zao is not very good. Zero. Are you talking about the tournament or Supermatch? Supermatch.
Ermes Gasparini: but do you think that he will work on it if he's coming for the match maybe he will train for that i think the endurance is if you have a genetic for endurance is better you understand yeah you can you can training for endurance but it's very difficult to
Engin Terzi: To change completely your endurance, you understand? Yeah, but some people just train for tournaments. And then, for example, before the Jerry vs. Gyorgy Shvetkov match, people said that maybe round one or something Gyorgy can win. But after the later rounds, because Jerry has incredible endurance. And then whenever I offered the match to Gyorgy, he had two months and he trained for endurance.
Engin Terzi: And then in this match, his endurance did very, very good, you know? Maybe, maybe, maybe Jerry, he don't have a good endurance with a very strong top roller. You understand? I don't know. They go down together, the endurance. You understand? Jerry pulled all kinds of top rollers in the past and everyone talks very highly about his endurance. Even you.
Engin Terzi: When you train for him, you were more training for the center and top row. I mean, while I just tried to say that, I mean, there is something proven that Jerry has very good endurance, but the other guy also trained so good and he did twice a day training. He was training daytime and that evening he was doing table time twice a day. Yeah. For me, this is impossible.
Engin Terzi: if i train like this i have a super pain in my yeah yeah but the bulgarians seriously they often train every day every day every day and they do table i don't know how they do for me it's impossible but uh yeah yeah yeah but but their system you can see that i always believe this there is not only one way
Engin Terzi: to be the best there are different yeah yeah sure sure yeah yeah so my friend bulgarian method is also proven to become the best bulgarians also have their own a call you know like like devon has his own way john has his own way you have your own way i have my own way kazakhs have their own way i don't exactly know how often as i start training but you know god created us in so beautifully that you can adapt to very different um
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah. Depends. I don't know. For me, when you are super, super heavyweight, like 170 kilos, 180 kilos, it's very difficult to have a good endurance. For me, I don't know. Because now his endurance is very...
Engin Terzi: It's very bad. It's not very good. I have a question for you, Georgii. What do you think about Georgii? Just say, like, if he would pull someone like Genadi, someone like Morozov, do you think that he wouldn't be serious? I think Georgii, if he's prepared, I think the guy is also a very dangerous guy. It may be wrong to judge him with the rough performance. You know that.
Engin Terzi: No, Gorg is a super-athlete, sure. I don't know now... He told me to set you against him and he said he would destroy you. Really? Yeah. Why not? Okay, make agreement. Why not? Do you approve him? My wish is impossible to...
Engin Terzi: He never said that, he never said that. I tell you what, the super heavyweight category, Hermes, in the history, has never been this tough. Never. Never. Yeah, now there are very... The level is right here, you know. Off the roof, you know, the level is... Crazy, crazy. Yes, yeah. John Brzezinski...
Ermes Gasparini: But I showed John, but I don't know. But in the last round, I don't show him very for 100% focus. Maybe when he was 2-1 winning, somehow, instead of securing the match, he wanted to do this. Yeah. And then I think there, in my opinion, I told him too,
Engin Terzi: I remember the earlier two rounds, he get it, he get it, he get it. And then Irakli gave up, you know, and then he won. But this time, somehow he just went, you know, he needed his cup. But whenever he went like this, the shoulder plate, his wrist was flattened. And then the match went and then come back and then lost. But there is nothing you can take away from Irakli. Irakli, I mean, won. But Johnny's type of guy that he cares about,
Engin Terzi: he won so many times that he's more like i want to win this way i want to win that way you understand yeah yeah yeah more focused on uh just satisfying himself then then winning the same thing he did with arsene linio i told him why don't you just go scrap every round and beat him why you try to hook him without the step you get clashed you know and then he's like he wants to beat him that way and then he lost
Engin Terzi: yeah really yes every round that he goes to strap he could have won you know except the sixth round that we repeated there was an elbow foul this and this and then he lost the round when both athletes agreed but he was already exhausted you know i don't know i don't know he just the guy is just different you know you you you need to prove something i need to prove something he doesn't have to prove anything yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah the same yeah but as i said super heavyweight category is incredibly hard today incredible yeah and they sure can add the gennady now is very good shape yeah where where do you think that could be a challenge for gennady do you think like for example morozov could be morozov was very good fight who would win who would win
Ermes Gasparini: Close. Very close. 50-50. Do you think that that match for sure will go inside? I think, more or less, he wants to go out. Do you think that he cannot catch him? Maybe not. I don't know.
Engin Terzi: Well, it's a very beautiful fight with Morozov. Morozov top rolls him. How is it beautiful? He's going to beat. Do you think that Genadi will defend like this? Or is it beautiful only if it goes through? He won with Ousmane like without the wrist. Not really. Not really. It was just... Not really. Yeah. But not very close. Yeah. But it is...
Engin Terzi: super good if he's inside pulling but because for many years he got injured so now his elbow is healed up but because of the injury he couldn't pull so he's only pulling outside not so much winning so he only pulls back so it is easier Genadi to like catch him here you understand because Ferit doesn't do attack so much more like he wants to take the risk first yeah yeah but I saw Genadi he felt zero to
Engin Terzi: to Farid. He won very easy. Easy, easy. I think every time whenever he tried, his wrist was... Yeah, but... He had the control, full control, but... Super control, yeah. Yeah, he had the control, yeah. Incredible. Yeah, yeah. So you are saying, who is winning there then? If you would bet on Genadi Amoroso? Genadi. Genadi would beat him?
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah. And you are saying that Morozov is going to take Genadi's wrist? But I think Genadi, he have a good aim. Morozov too. But I think Genadi, he will be very prepared for this and he will win. You know, before Georgii left Istanbul, in the restaurant,
Engin Terzi: Genadi is asking me to pull Morozov and then because you know same as you are Genadi is younger than me and I like to tease I said Genadi why do you want this much Morozov is here you are here he's like he's like I love to tease you understand I love to tease
Engin Terzi: and and i i said i said no it's too much for you so more i joke more he gets you know upset i will show you you know he's like yeah yeah maybe very good fight yes yeah we will see we will see and and then um yeah it will be incredible so you are saying that jerry would beat devon you are saying that canada would beat morozov but if devon beats jerry and if if
Ermes Gasparini: If Genadi beat Morozov and so next month you beat Levan, right? Yeah. So then you should pull against Devon, right? For the Super Heavyweight title. Yeah. Okay. I send him pasta, spaghetti, pizza, everything. He will go to the Super Heavyweight and then we have a match.
Ermes Gasparini: Not 120 anymore? My friend, there are no change. Come on. But you accepted on the live. You want me to show you? You want me to find you here? Yeah, but after this he wrote to me. He wanted to be super heavyweight. Oh. Oh, I see. He told me in the live he will come 150 kilos.
Engin Terzi: 50 kilo yeah 150 150 oh i don't know if he's joking or not he's just joking with you yeah to barbers he said that you know england here only and then leave here and then i said no he said no no no
Engin Terzi: he said his wife jody would love that way he was just playing you understand and then so probably he's playing with you too he will never be 150 kilo yeah i know yeah roman 130. yeah possible yeah of course yeah yeah roman says that you know roman right yeah he said just appreciate how much hermes english improves he said you're
Engin Terzi: english improved a lot i remember when you come to the istanbul event uh after the event was finished you came the next day from because i'm smart my friends you are smart people now i'm joking but
Ermes Gasparini: This is very good satisfaction for me. Because one year ago, I remember without this, without this translator like this, only two, three words I remember. But now my English is not perfect.
Engin Terzi: I see I can speak with everybody in interview. And your accent, Italian accent together is very good. Beautiful. Yeah, beautiful.
Ermes Gasparini: okay uh we have we have eight people wrote to me no don't learn more my friend because like this is bad they like your actions right they like your accent yeah yeah roman empire the roman empire yes yes yes yes yeah we are yes it's fun we have eight minutes in fact now seven minutes then we talk one hour we will talk so we are 53 minutes now
Engin Terzi: no problem so you are saying that again with morozo and then devon would be jerry and then hermes would lose to saur and that was next you said that is very interesting we are interesting yeah yeah so you are saying that you are saying that after you beat the one you take both titles
Engin Terzi: and then three months later there's all become the the best in the world maybe maybe about that there are only 0.01 percent this is our chance right is our chance yeah but but whenever i talk with some people i'm not gonna name they think that he's gonna beat you yeah really yeah
Engin Terzi: nice so is it how do you say it's beautiful dream beautiful dreaming yeah yeah listen listen we have like six minutes let's let's talk about the uh king of the table next month it is gonna be amazing event amazing amazing yeah and do you think that do you think that john doesn't have any chance at all against dennis as some people think
Ermes Gasparini: I think John will take his wrist in the top row like this. But I don't know, maybe... John will take Dennis' wrist? Yeah, I think. Not completely, not completely like this. But maybe like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But Dennis will have some pronator here, right? Yeah. And if Dennis...
Ermes Gasparini: I don't know there are some rules about the king move in the king of the table. I don't think that Denis will go under the table. Denis is just pulling that way. This is open arm top roll. It's all fine, you know. Am I if he will use his bone? I mean, as long as this shoulder doesn't go under, it's fine.
Engin Terzi: And these are the rules for the king move. I don't know how they rule is. I don't really know how much, how it is, how much they allow. I don't know, but I think they don't. In east versus west, what is it, the rules? I give, I give, we give directly foul. If you go, you will go down with, if you go down with your shoulder. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Engin Terzi: yeah because i show many discussion when uh with uh because i don't understand what is it the rules like this yeah people are saying that people are saying that ermis doesn't know what he's talking about they say that dennis is gonna destroy uh john i don't think that is gonna be the case
Engin Terzi: I don't know if Dennis is going to win or not. Dennis still looks a little bit favorite to me, but I don't think that he's going to destroy him. I really don't think. And I think it's going to be a good match. It doesn't matter who wins. And I think John, he will go with 110% focus to win. Yeah. I don't want to talk about everything, but
Engin Terzi: Maybe you know as well, but John will be stronger than how he was in Istanbul. Yeah, sure. Much, much better endurance than Istanbul. Sure. Yeah, it's going to be incredible. It's going to be incredible. Your match with Levan, the biggest match in the world right now. And I don't know.
Engin Terzi: I just can't wait. I just can't wait. Listen, both Levan and you are my friends and good friends. But like, I would like you to stop him somewhere here. I don't care who wins. Both are my friends and I'm organizer and I will be hosting you guys here. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: against different opponents. But I would like you to just stop him here. If you would stop him there, the world would have gone crazy. Crazy, my friend. We'd be crazy. Yeah, but I will tell you something. Sometimes when Levan is doing some table time with, like, Irakli or something, sometimes when he goes, his wrist is just, you know, bouncing. And sometimes I'm thinking, you know, like, if that wrist, like, if Hermes would hit there instead of Irakli, I mean, I'm just thinking...
Engin Terzi: i kind of feel that it will be very hard for him to control your arm like this you know he will like i think you are i mean when did you get hooked by someone last time i don't remember you don't remember i mean at least like somebody if some people beat you without yeah but to control your arm like this i am i don't remember when i mean i'm sure some people did but even
Ermes Gasparini: many years ago 2016 rustam had hard time he take you till here and then yeah yeah the elbow is the last but but he couldn't hook you i think he couldn't and the rules time he have a you know the hand of bruce time is the best best yeah he's crazy my friend yeah but the finger everything here is crazy
Engin Terzi: You remember when Pauline wanted to try first two round outside? It was Pauline became effective when he went inside. But whenever he tried to go outside, Rustem just... One second. Yeah, yeah. And Rustem is just coming back after three years. And so what I'm just trying to say that even when you were... What was it? What were you? 86 kilos or 95 kilos? 95. That 95 kilos...
Engin Terzi: Ermes Gasparini gave big problems to Rustam Babayev's wrists, which is like incredible. And now you are about 130 kilos, of course, your opponent is like the best ever, strongest guy in the history, for sure, in my opinion, at least. But I'm just saying, what if he goes sideways and then somewhere here? Ah.
Engin Terzi: I'm very excited for this. I'm very curious and I think it will be very interesting, yeah. Yeah, people are also talking about Denis' training with Kurdesha, but the Kurdesha that we saw there also wasn't really like the ready shape of Kurdesha, right? About Denis, about Denis. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: about Denis and Kurdejka together. Yeah, yeah. No, what I'm just saying that Kurdejka that after Poo with Denis was not the competition shape Kurdejka either, you know, like we cannot really compare him, you know, like. Yeah. So we will see. I think that, I think that like maybe Lewand will beat you. Maybe Denis will beat John, but
Engin Terzi: It may be different, you know and many, many times I saw that, like when when I said they've kept a bit more also I need to go back and look at it, but maybe it was like 85% they're happy. You know yeah yeah yeah remember. yeah so who knows, maybe, maybe the things will be different anyway, so you are you going to pay me that 20% or not.
Engin Terzi: 30, 30. 30%. But everyone has witnessed it. I will be at your corner. Yeah. But if Levan reaches me and don't be at his corner, be at my corner, I give you 35%, then who knows, you know. Okay. Anyways, guys, just, guys, this weekend, Saturday, there will be
Engin Terzi: Devon Larratt vs. Sandriss Sadis match. At my event, Devon is ranked number one, Sandriss is ranked number three. So this is incredible level event. Just find out, go to Armors YouTube channel and become a member and then watch the event. This is like, what, 6.99 or something pounds. It's incredible event. There will be some other matches as well. And after that one,
Engin Terzi: the king of the table like it went at the highest level you know dennis blanco worship john brzenk is not only an event of today but this is a historical event it too and i guarantee you one thing that john will come there in
Engin Terzi: best shape since he come back in 2021 july he will not come there like like he will be in different level and this guy ermes in my opinion is the best top roller in the world and i hope this one i can say both are my friends but i hope you know he will give big gravel who who wins i just say that the one who deserves

Just go there as an Italian gladiator. Just fight there. You are responsible to fight, not to win. Just go there, fight. Whatever you deserve, you will get it, but just fight. Okay, my friend?

I believe that you can do it. I believe that you are going to do an incredible job. And I'm not going to motivate.
Engin Terzi: the one he doesn't need he's already the favorite one yeah it is not because i am feeling closer friends to you than him you both are great guys anyway so i wish you the best i don't want to take your time we already passed five minutes then what we agreed i think you're gonna have a dinner with your family yeah and

Engin Terzi: I want to come back and pull 85 kilo. Prediction, Sandris versus Devon. I expect a tough match, but I don't expect Sandris to win. I expect Devon to win. Yeah. And again, don't leave us. Just relax. Leave. What do you mean? Right now? No, I'm not gonna go anywhere. We can chat a few more minutes if you guys want.
Engin Terzi: We want to see you against Larry in Dubai. I want to do some matches. Training, I don't know. Because I stopped training for the last East versus West. And then after I come back, I just couldn't start training again. See? Roman knows what he's talking about. And you, why don't face Levan? Yeah, I can face him like this. But that's all, you know.
Engin Terzi: But by the way, I may go to Georgii soon. I may go to Georgii, yeah. I plan to visit Istanbul in July and be at East versus West seven. You will be missing by two months. But if you go on for East versus West eight, then you can. All those matches. Engin, will you invite Levan for the podcast? Yes, next week we're gonna do it.
Engin Terzi: Any idea if Sanderis will get the shield if he wins? I don't know if we didn't talk about that one. How much for the purple? Next match versus Rambets. Rambets, July. Engin, stop bulking up. Devon't make any mistakes. Any idea when will you announce the matches? In...
Engin Terzi: Probably three weeks. I'm not going to say which matches are confirmed. Yeah, Alkaffings is pulling at the East versus West. Engin Rustam is one of Hermes' favorite players. Of course. I mean, Rustam is a legend. He's incredible. Oh, thank you, Aaron. Thank you, my friend. Thank you.
Engin Terzi: I will be in Georgii from 18 March to 31st. No, I may go to Georgii anytime soon. I may go, seriously. That was very inspirational there at the end. It got me so woke up. I think I can be the one to stop in India. I mean, that is what it is, you know.
Engin Terzi: like the competition mode of Engin is different than the organizer mode. That is when I'm competing, it's different, you know, I mean, you wouldn't want to be around, you know, that's different. It will be incredible matches, my friend, incredible matches. And seriously, I think, um,
Engin Terzi: Possibly he's going to answer next week, but Dave Patton will be our guest of honor. He said that he's going to talk with the family and his work, but he said he would love to. Thank you, Sursum. Yeah, Muratov is incredible, yeah. Who impressed you the most last year versus a lot of guys, a lot of guys?
Engin Terzi: Brown says, you must do a world tour before you exit the game. My friend, I'm so tired of traveling. All my life I traveled. English book for East versus West 7. Soon we will know. Now is English on competition is the enigma. Yeah, English on the competition is different. React for real. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: indeed go really in hermes corner yeah i mean i mean if i go i will yeah their pattern is legends i watched this which was six miles incredible for model thank you my friend mean that engine don't stop or how much you will suffer my friend i i told you guys one thing as long as you guys support me i will continue
Engin Terzi: um this was seven in april eight in july okay yes yes mark but not april may 6th east versus west is may 6th that's why i said you will be missing by two months um i don't know if hermes if he can beat levan or not but i need to really i need to really encourage hermes to do this hermes if
Engin Terzi: hermes is going there he needs to be mentally spiritually you know physically at his 100 do everything he can if he still loses he loses but you know it is hard to not to be intimidated by levan so we don't want that to be case you know so hermes i'm sure he can do everything by himself he brought his own self to here he doesn't need anybody's help but you know still we do our parts to to um
Engin Terzi: encourage the guy. I mean, I would like to ask what is the plans on East versus Seven soon. In a few weeks, we will be knowing that, yeah. Yeah, the Hermes 15, that weight is incredible, but it alone doesn't really
Engin Terzi: Um, you know, if you ask John, he's not gonna like whatever Iraq is lifting. I don't think that John can do anything near to that, but, but at the table, when they both went back, so that John's and risk was the one that survived, not this pressure, but this pressure saved, uh, Iraq. So it just don't be intimidated. Yes. Those lips are very important, everything, but.
Engin Terzi: Um, but it, that it alone doesn't really, uh, make you the best arm master in the world. So I, I saw the way that Hermes lifted that weight is more. Yeah. As you said, beneficial. Yeah. Go on.
Engin Terzi: Hey, Engin, I just got my cards today and wanted to let you know that they are amazing. I'm very happy that you liked my friend. Just remember, there are two cards, so Corey and Ferit, because of right and left, they prefer to sign only one card. That's why you don't have the opposite arm sign, you know. So every app that signed their own cards, but Ferit and Corey didn't sign the other arm, second arm, you know.
Engin Terzi: what is the best way to compare our masters to set them pulling against each other yeah um when is voyvoda coming you said he is coming back i don't remember i was probably drunk or upset i'm not going to say anything until where you need to king of the table
Engin Terzi: thank you thank you my friends um we will thank you very much for your work um yeah i know brian brian's job yeah i i i know him i mean i don't know him personally but i got to know him after derek shared the videos that extremists and also derek
Engin Terzi: Thank you very much, my friends, for the T-shirts. I assume you'll have a, I have it on me and then have a picture with it and share. Thank you. Thank you, Strange Lands. Hello to Newfoundland, Canada. Who decides the number on cars? What do you mean number on the cars, my friend? Oh, you mean the stats? I mean, mostly I decide, but sometimes, you know,
Engin Terzi: I also asked to Neil pick up and they will let us open it usually in a very critical ones and then our opinions are. Like very similar sometimes 0.5 difference, you know. Oh, john had a snow mobile crashed oh I didn't know this.
Engin Terzi: Okay, I didn't know that. They wouldn't criticize what, my friend?
Engin Terzi: Numbers were messed up. Ask Devon. I don't know. Devon never told me anything. I don't think I need to ask anything to Devon. If he wants to say something to me, I'm just one message away from him or one video call away from him. I have no idea John had a crash.
Engin Terzi: Will you ever come to this tour? So when will that be? Big love from London. Hello to London, UK. I don't know. I don't know. I was just thinking maybe can I make it May events or maybe July events? I don't know. Oh, he's talking about the Gabriela's Heights or something. I don't know.
Engin Terzi: um yeah um soon soon roma soon i will decide you know if i can go to um would you make rematches for some of your good matches or would you rather make new matches it's also up to you guys what we will see
Engin Terzi: I may go anywhere. It totally depends on the offer. I offer Sasho matches many times. One time through a third person, we made an agreement, but somehow it changed. So I don't want to go there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Julio Martinez. Thank you, my friend. Thank you.
Engin Terzi: Please make Hamna compete on East versus West. Who is Hamna? I don't know. Am I getting old? I don't know Hamna. Who is Hamna? Engin, if Sanzit can beat Devon, how do you think he will do it? Dead risk, maybe? I believe Devon is going to win, but who knows?
Engin Terzi: Do I have any matches for Revaz? Revaz, I'll also offer him three times. He was not available. I can tell you guys that I am offering any, every elite athlete, you know, matches. Anna Montana. Anna Montana, US Armwrestler from Ohio.
Engin Terzi: Okay. I don't think Levan is afraid of anyone. Levan is a very brave guy, but Levan is taking everything very seriously. He said, Engin, every match I'm going to give 110%.
Engin Terzi: Okay, I can start monetizing my short videos I don't think I have short videos but. And there is asking what is your percentage on the devil or to some just match, I will say 7034. That one. yeah I heard about this rags. or reals. will make or.
Engin Terzi: course for anyone not aware you took course today is monetized chances ultra i was coming back to compete i was more hopeful before before before i saw him but he would know better um why can't anyone get a hold of your kanaya i don't know i i wish i could i could reach him i would invite him
Engin Terzi: Yeah, why these messages are getting deleted? Thank you, Atlas. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. I am no different than you guys. There is one thing in common with the most important that brought us together. It's the love for arm wrestling. I can't claim anything about my organization or organizer level, athletic level or something, but about the fan level,
Engin Terzi: I'm right here with anyone else about the level of being armwrestling fan. What was the shortest time you ever had to prepare for a Supermatch or a tournament and how did you win? I don't know. I don't remember much. I'm so focused on organizing that I even forgot how I was armwrestling.
Engin Terzi: has the highest iq enormous in european you can say yourself um devon has very high level iq uh the last event show hunger bear is incredible and in the way that he's doing michael i think has very high level iq um um
Engin Terzi: um rudny has high level iq there are there are there are there are a few more you know um john brusing is the really highest um yeah i'm doing my best
Engin Terzi: my friends, I'm doing my best to set the best matches. But remember, sometimes matches may not be like the most exciting one, but some matches has to be set, you know, no matter what. That match has to happen. It may go one way quickly, but the match needs to happen. You know, you can't really hold back.
Engin Terzi: Um, what do you want me to, well, I, I, I mentioned Igor Mazarenko for his service in arm wrestling in the past, you know, for like many times I, but what, what do you want me to, like, we talking about the guys that we're gonna set the super masters. I don't know what, what do you want me to mention for, uh, who is the best table? I can super heavyweight. Do we also, I can tell you guys like those guys listen, whenever I talk with Devon,
Engin Terzi: one said that dennis siplenko was the smartest person he ever armless this is what he said something like that he said for sure maybe he said one older or maybe exactly the smartest i don't remember i'm gonna upload tonight johnny after this one i'm gonna upload
Engin Terzi: Highest IQ in our message is this to me in numbers and I don't know. There are many I can't really measure, but these guys are very, very good. Yeah, Dennis Planko.
Engin Terzi: You look at from outside, you see a big guy, rich guy, strong guy. You don't expect him to be like, but whenever you talk with him, the guy is super intelligent guy, you know? And the guy in his mind is very clear, you know? He doesn't get like intimidated by anything. The guy is on his own way. He has his own opinions, very smart opinions. I mean, the guy, the more you get to know him,
Engin Terzi: closely you are really he's like you are amazed by him i don't know about my friend i don't know some many people wrote i don't know if someone has crashed i i didn't hear about it how is your right arm feeling now i like seeing you on the table again ah it feels not bad not not bad
Engin Terzi: nothing close to prime if it feels prime i may surprise you guys um yeah i don't know it's gonna be but the matches that i don't tell you guys is right front of me all of them are written i have like 60 something to 90 something
Engin Terzi: three boards on the wall. Everything is written there, everything. The matches are written there. A little bit of it needs to be finalized. And I'm just thinking if I should do two days event, 10 match each day, or I should do a 10 match, it really looks still hard. I can make it 10 matches, but I would like to upset some of the athletes
Engin Terzi: So most likely it's going to be like 11 or 12, you know. But we will see, you know. I just like, I want to do everything, you know. For me, the satisfaction of the athletes is more important. Satisfaction of myself is also very important. Whenever I look at this event, like you're doing an art, you know, okay, now, yeah, it's good, you know.
Engin Terzi: and then if i'm not satisfied you know and then my satisfaction usually means like more money to spend you know what 150 kilo category is no good my friend a lot of like there will be like three guys left zauf
Engin Terzi: the one for us probably at like really high level, you know, uh, Timmy, I will tell you something at the beginning, I felt like, you know, it didn't help so much, but more I arm muscle more, I feel like it was very slow, but steady that I kind of start to feel my finger hand wrist, um, better, you know, I, I, I don't like,
Engin Terzi: Whenever you do stem cells, don't expect you to feel powerful. It's not hormonal. It is not like, you know, like it doesn't give you power, you know, but like you feel more, I would say, mobility, I should say. Tony, I told you already why you repeat my friend. I'm going to upload the video after this live program.
Engin Terzi: Please don't ask again, you know you get your answer I don't know what's your purpose I kind of dislike when people are just begin and begin and begin and begin, while we are having a good time here together. You know. or tomorrow's or tomorrow's or we'll be here in May, he will be here in May may events, he has a very tough opponents, we will see.
Engin Terzi: Derek being proud of his power bank during East vs. West stream. I don't think it was East vs. West one. Was it? Was Derek? No, Derek wasn't here in East vs. West. Derek was in the best 78 kilo event. Not this one. We are planning to do some other things, you know.
Engin Terzi: um surprises it was lucky it was not 2020 it was 2021 march that show iraqli yeah and i pull we are i don't think morozov's weight is 144.
Engin Terzi: It's a real picture, but I don't know if he's really 144 kilos. No, East versus West was in June 12, 2021. And March 21 was the best 78. And the second time I did the best 78, it was April 24, 2021. East versus West, yes, there was Hermes versus Matt Mask, yeah.
Engin Terzi: And do you see any Indian arm master who deserves to let this work, I mean it needs to be somewhere like world champion as well, even the every world champion we don't we cannot invite there are many, many outlets, you know. Yes, my friends, we will sell tickets yeah. Thank you for hanging out and chatting I really enjoyed yeah you're welcome, I also enjoy you know you guys, we have something in common, we. enjoy you know.
Engin Terzi: um spending time together yeah but i will go out what is your opinion about the regional nursing this is the thing is the meat and thanks he says he's asking is asking top open for morozov could mean kennedy or jerry so what if one of them which one is better
Engin Terzi: Yeah, May 29th, I think. Yeah, May 29th, I think it was the Devon Larratt versus Michael Todd match, yeah. Guys, get your pay-per-view for the King of the Table 6. It's going to be incredible. And also this week, this weekend, Armour channel, you become members and watch Sandri say this, Devon Larratt, we need to support
Engin Terzi: his events. Also, most likely Babayev Cup will be the East versus West qualification event. I think SG beat Engin easily. Yes. Love the East versus West event. Hope you are doing well. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Genadi versus Vitalii. Morozov versus Jerry. And then winner versus winner.
Engin Terzi: I have no one else talking about arm wrestling in real life. Yeah. I'm just begging you so much that I would cancel my own flight ticket. For what? I don't understand. I missed something. Anyways, guys, so maybe I go. If you guys don't have anything to ask, who will jump on your next event? We don't know. Yeah, Timmy.
Engin Terzi: will be good yeah and now i think they are going to put one more event in canada i think there will be two qualification events in canada and then six in u.s and one already happened in bolivia gabriella organized so the top two guys in each category and ladies in each category will go to the finals and then in europe the east versus west qualifications will be in england norway italy
Engin Terzi: And I think now in Babaev's Cup and Latvia and I think Romania and Jordan and I think South Africa. I think Terence Opperman will also do in South Africa. Yeah. Yeah, John versus Evgeny. Evgeny has some small
Engin Terzi: problems with the passports. I think, I shouldn't say this maybe, but there is nothing to be hiding, you know, just, but I think he kind of lost his passport. And I said, maybe you get a new passport. And he said, there is only one person working at the Ukrainian embassy. And there are like almost Ukrainian right now in Europe and where he is.
Engin Terzi: So yeah, but he is hopeful that he will find a passport. I don't know how he will do it, but I hope he finds. Thank you. Thank you. And again, the Olympic Committee declared that the Russian athletes, they can compete and they can compete in 2024 Paris Olympics.
Engin Terzi: But they said that they cannot represent Council Russia, they will be neutral athletes. And then, in my opinion, WAF is gonna also, I think they also received the same letter, and I think they are also gonna, I don't know, but this is the letter they received from IOC, as far as I know, and IOC already
Engin Terzi: allowed i think the russian atlas to compete in asia um in a press conference after these forces was yeah the guys i start the event at 8 p.m and the event is long so it's it finishes like 1 a.m 2 a.m in the morning in a press conference after that i don't know you may ask why the event starts late because the athletes from uh
Engin Terzi: the North America, not just the viewers from North America, they just wake up, you know, when it is eight o'clock here, PM, which is 9am in California. But since it is East versus West, it is normal that, you know, we set a time that, you know, the Western people can watch their athletes, you know, in this event. I kind of think that Sarah Beckman versus Hegley.
Engin Terzi: would be a better match. I think Iraq is older than 187, my friend. I say 63. People say it's not 63. I think Iraq is 190 centimeters.
Engin Terzi: Will you tell fans Dennis versus Hogan, East versus West night? No, I'm not gonna say. Will Travis be part of the next events? Possibly, yes. Soon I will know. From my side, yes. From his side, he needs to check a few things because his son is, you know, like about the football things, you know.
Engin Terzi: I think Hermes is 188, Iraq 89 or 90, yeah. Yeah. Who do you think? Who do you like? Who has the strongest grip? Not like the strongest grip in arm wrestling world. Who has that? Or who are the like top three guys? No, Iraq is...
Engin Terzi: not six one or two of my friends okay guys tell me who has the strongest grip in arm wrestling top three you tell me top three big growth goals thank you for your super chat what percentage of paper we buyers come from the united states i don't know my friends that is the company streaming company would know that
Engin Terzi: strongest grip person gospel in 11 you are probably not following carefully or closely yeah see vitally is one of them see one guy said tobias and vitally those are correct answers yeah obvious wrong and vitally lalatin has the strongest grip power yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: And what if Laletin and Tobias pull left arm? They both go top row. Yeah, Vitalii is probably number one here. But Tobias is right behind him as far as I know.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, both has very strong grip. And then Tobias' left arm is very strong. Yeah, Vitalii's left arm is also very good, yeah. Yeah, that would be interesting. When Morozov beats Tobias, he tried to topple Tobias, topple and crush Morozov's hand. What Morozov did was just spinate his hook and beat him. But Laletin doesn't have that kind of technique.
Engin Terzi: Ability, like low grips, grenade hook. And so, obviously, if they would pull with Vitalii's left arm, they both would hit outside. And then we will see how strong their hands are.
Engin Terzi: Nobody has like a magic stick or something. Anything is possible. If that happens, then things will... No, Vitalii is from Russia. And for more than one year, the International Federation didn't allow Russian pullers to pull over here.
Engin Terzi: Italy, Kurdish, and Morozov are probably top three super weight on left arm. Morozov beat Tobias, but again, in Morozov, very easy. It's just Andrus was there. Also, Tobias beat Morozov one round when he went outside.
Engin Terzi: my favorite dish is adnan the one that we ate together when you visited me didn't cobra have a strong grip during time yeah yeah endurance tests brown yeah anyways guys so i let you guys go you let me go i have things to do but i kind of miss you know chatting with you guys it's good you know i hope we do that
Engin Terzi: more often so we can we can talk about it what's going on in the arm wrestling world yeah my friend to squeeze in something and your hand being a block and not to get open are different things like my squeezing never being good never but opening my hand was always very hard it just asked anyone in the world they will say that
Engin Terzi: I probably had the strongest pound for pound hand, you know, when I was in my prime, you know, like when I was 65, you know, for my weight or 60 kilos, 65, my hand was incredibly strong. So, but this inclusion in something in armwrestling is not always like, doesn't always mean that, you know, you have the best hand for armwrestling. Yeah. I thank you guys. Thank you, Matt. Thank you guys. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Thank you, Big Bambino. Thank you, guys. I will soon announce, not so soon, but I will announce the matches. I'm sure you guys will enjoy. I do my best. Thank you, Humberto. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Thank you, Adnan. Thank you, guys.
