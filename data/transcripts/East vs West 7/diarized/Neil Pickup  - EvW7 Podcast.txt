Engin Terzi: GB19, hello, my friends. Stratus Matthew, hello, good day. Good day, my friends. Hello, Miguel. That's your kindness, Miguel. Yeah, it's getting bigger, I think, at least.
Engin Terzi: Hello Aydan. Hello Phil Woody. Next time Phil, next time we're good friends. Iftar-ı 10 dakika oldu. Patates yemeğiyle tümüştüm. Sana hesap mı vereceğim aslan kardeşim? Yapmayın böyle saçma sapan şeyleri. Hello Laşa.
Engin Terzi: I love you, Margaret. Are you also excited for these upcoming days? There will be so many great matches. Yes, I am excited. Sam, what do you think about the idea of a bonus for the match of the night, rounds of the night? Yeah, that would be nice. Proving astrology. Thank you, my friend. At my first tournament, everyone I picked up had me outclassed in hands.
Engin Terzi: and wrist strength, but my arm strength was able to constrain in many circumstances. Yeah, the more you compete, the more you will be feeling good. Hello, Neil. Hello, hello, my friends. Hello, Engin Terzi. How are you doing, mate? Hello, Neil Pickup. Neil Pickup, today we have a special guest. Special guest that I don't know, he doesn't need me to
Engin Terzi: tell you guys um who he is but if i would describe from my side world-class arm masters one of the best organizers in the history best announcer best commentator and one of those guys that knows a lot about arm wrestling
Neil Pickup: and it is an honor to host you thank you very much thank you for having me on it's nice to come on uh and and talk about pulling for a little while just say hello to everybody uh hell of a day today stupid busy uh just finished today's work so um yeah knocking on my head and coming in to speak to you guys so hope everybody's okay another support proven astrology the problem i have is that i end up in awkward positions
Engin Terzi: like a flop press. My arm feels fine, but some of the more experienced people around me were very concerned I would break my arm. Probably you have general horsepower, but you don't have the control. And when you give your all, then you find yourself in those positions. Another super chat, then we can start. Do you advise on what I can do to decrease my risk on injury
Engin Terzi: but not lay down every time I lose my wrist. Sorry for the long question, so pumped to see Neil. My friend, I think that you need to train more of your hand, wrist, finger, forearm trainings to have more control. But about losing your wrist and not getting injured or getting injured, you know, it is hard for me to tell you without knowing how you are built.
Engin Terzi: But you may have an injury from your elbow, but make sure that you don't pull while your shoulder is in front of your hand. This is an invitation to humerus break, especially for someone who is new to arm wrestling.
Neil Pickup: Anyways, Neil, how have you been, my friend? You have that wall sign behind you. Yeah, it's just a little background. I have a background that I came on through Google Chrome tonight. When you sent the link over, it came through Google Chrome, and I uploaded it onto my laptop.
Neil Pickup: rather than my iPad. And it's a bit of a classic. It's an old vintage. Back in the day when we used to do the WL This Week podcast, this was the background for that. So, you know, it was preloaded. So, you know. You know, it is just how I see it. It's just, you know, flag race. Say it one more time. You broke up a little, Engin. Flag race, like flag, you know.
Engin Terzi: you know you know those four people running they finish their part and they give the flag to the next guy and then he runs and yeah like this is how i see the pal how i see wal ual your uh arm words and like right now we have east versus west king of the table you know we are all black carriers you know like yeah there may be a you know
Engin Terzi: know i i never had an intention to organize professional events like this this happened because you know someday you call me again because of kovid everything is feeling down let's go to the podcast presence of greatness ui john and devon and i was like i said in that room i was like okay let's do it if community needs
Neil Pickup: us then let's do it you know and then start what are you doing mate it's funny i saw the i saw the list you put up the other day and it was great you know the the list of athletes yeah uh that have taken part in east versus west that's awesome in such a short time
Neil Pickup: yeah and when you look at you look at something like that you know it's it's nice to just take a moment and breathe and think wow you know look at some of the matches and some of the guys that have have competed you know it's really like you say short period of time and it's it's warming up it's not it's not slowing down why why this is happening neil this is because of love you know you and i we both know that's why you also do it
Neil Pickup: Yeah, that's for sure. I've got to be honest, sometimes you question why you do it. But, you know, so I say, I got to be honest, some days you question why you do it. But, you know, when you put a shift in and worked all day and you come home and think. I mean, the why is because there was COVID, everything was gone.
Engin Terzi: someone had to do something you know that that is why you and i are here maybe there will be a point that i will quiz and then some people will raise it up more and then if they need it again you know we will step up you understand so what i'm just saying that do we do that i why i did that it is because i wanted to fulfill my dream
Engin Terzi: was so are you enjoying it that's the main thing yeah i was so upset are you enjoying what you what you're what you're doing was divided to east and west it was unfair yeah it was unfair that all those eastern guys pulling here all the western guys pulling there we have one world in the community and fans and even the athletes they deserve to be
Neil Pickup: you know meeting at one place so this this is this is but still many people many people still they don't appreciate they they just when you look at it it's like it's been a perfect storm of opportunity in some ways which has facilitated the things to come around in the way that they have
Neil Pickup: Obviously, the transition and the break between major organizations being involved in promoting arm wrestling on a global level, most notably in the recent past, you had the Professional Arm Wrestling League and the WAL.
Neil Pickup: obviously on opposite sides of the ocean. And that was restrictive in some respects because people gravitated towards, as they would, the nearest opportunity. Both those organizations were doing great, great things. Both those organizations were doing interesting things. You had the top eight with the PAL, which was really getting going. WAL was in its stride at that time. Both organizations doing good stuff. But the one downside of that
Neil Pickup: was the fact that a lot of the athletes were locked up. So they were in their own little environment and didn't really step outside of that a great deal, certainly not en masse. When COVID sort of changed the whole dynamic, the global dynamic of the sport and what was possible, all of those restrictions were removed. And in some respects, it's created, I think the world of arm wrestling and the world generally has evolved.
Neil Pickup: involved enormously you know and and some of the things that have come out of that I don't think they will ever revert some of for certain athletes within arm wrestling I'm not sure whether those situations will go back to where they were there's a different uh it's a different time it's a different place there's a different energy around the sport right now and I do think
Neil Pickup: A lot of good things came out of that. East versus West is brought together at an elite level more frequently than ever before. Some of the matches which otherwise would not have been possible to create. So from that perspective, it can only be, it's very positive, isn't it? You know? Yeah. You know, people are asking, you know, how to put this at once, you know?
Neil Pickup: But I do that normally whenever I swipe, it should be showing both of us. There's a view, isn't there? Is it called Gallery View? From where? I think it's up in the top. On my screen, it's the top corner.
Neil Pickup: so they're not pretty right yeah if you look at if you look at the top right corner there should be a a series of small squares and it should say view and if you click that and put it on gallery i think that shows but are you able to do that only i can do it you i can do it here yeah yeah i don't think that will change it on the because you you sort of own the the the meeting it should only be your end amends yeah but i don't i don't
Neil Pickup: I don't see that thing. There is only at the right corner, it says on the end. Oh. Is there anywhere on the screen that you have like a series, like a square with a lot of small squares in there? And it says view. If you move your cursor around, can you see that anywhere? It should say gallery view. It says video call effects, reset all backgrounds, settings.
Neil Pickup: don't know maybe in the settings all right no problem now i know on my on my screen in front of me it's in the top right corner and it only comes on screen when i move the cursor to it you know if i move the cursor up to there then it'll come on but outside of that it doesn't
Neil Pickup: you can see ladies and gentlemen both myself and you know technical masters of youtube okay yeah you need a techie director in here timmy turner's in the chat there i've just seen he said we need coach ray the technical director come on and sort that out
Engin Terzi: Sorry, I don't have some option yet. There is like more whenever I click more security medium setting. I don't think so. I don't think I have it, but captions, whiteboard, application, record, share, reactions, chats, parts, stop video, mute. And there is sound. But you've got nothing that says view anywhere. No, I don't know why. Are you on a laptop or a phone?
Neil Pickup: phone ah okay maybe it's different on a phone i don't know on a phone okay sorry guys why don't you put it on just you nobody wants to look at my ugly fat mug just put it on you and hear me anyways yeah so yeah so let's talk about what's coming up and
Neil Pickup: what's your next event for me we've got uh straight after east versus west we we move into high gear on the dark card too so we got we got that coming up um devon lara is gonna be the headliner on dark card two uh we were trying to get this turkish dude this hanging character
Neil Pickup: he can't travel right now so he's gonna have to wait till later in the year we've got some other good matches on there i can probably let people know a couple of the undercard matches which i'm quite excited about craig sanders he's pulling there uh the birmingham bullet he's gonna be pulling against an american lad called kevin palco who just did really well at the arnold classic love kevin uh so kev's gonna be on the card the dark card uh we're gonna keep um just to let everybody know it's not live
Engin Terzi: set up one more time for a soundbite it is not live so yeah just so people know do you know do you know who i am bringing here for the east versus six who you bringing over just as a respect charlie who you bring in charlie minnell oh man i haven't seen charlie in years yeah my god i'm sure that
Neil Pickup: 90 of the community doesn't know about him but he's one of those guys that you know really really really served arm wrestling world of arm wrestling yeah i haven't seen charlie for my god i'll bet it's seriously must be 10 to 15 years we're talking a long period of time yeah oh it'd be nice to see him yeah charlie minnell one of sweden's finest looks like like an extra from team wolf
Neil Pickup: I bet he's aged now, mate. It's like me and you. We're not contenders anymore. None of that youthful soft skin. Look at this. If I take my hat off, Jesus, I'm grey. That's why I've got this hat on.
Engin Terzi: Sean Connery considered to be most handsome guy when he was like around 60. So don't worry about it. Yeah. Yeah. He didn't have back tits either. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sean Connery is a different dude, mate. Very different. I'll take it though.
Engin Terzi: I will tell you something. I think when he was 60, he was better looking than when he was 30, in my opinion. Hey, you keep pushing it on, Engin. That's all right. You're selling the fact that we can get to that level, Sean Connery. No, it's the opposite for me. It's the opposite for me. I'm only talking about that guy, you know, not me. Are you excited about this one? Are you buzzing?
Engin Terzi: What's that? Are you buzzing about this next East versus West show? Some mega bats just coming up here, mate. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There is a question they're asking me when I met. No, it wasn't 2001 Niagara Falls. It was end of 2002 Niagara Falls when I met Devon. And I don't know when Neil met him first time. I think 1999, Japan. Japan, Japan, the World Championship. Yeah, I think 1999, Japan was the first time he came over and introduced himself at the practice table.
Engin Terzi: yeah long time ago yeah i'm excited i am excited it will be it will be incredible i mean i don't even know which matches like to pick as the favorite one they all have listened if you are a fan or most popular thing
Engin Terzi: then we know what's the most important match. Of course, everybody's tuning in for Devon and Genadi. Yeah, but if you are pure arm-wrestling fan, you can find a great excitement in each of those matches. Oh, without question, yeah. One of the matches I'm looking forward to most is Baccio and Adam. I'm really looking forward to it because it's that unknown thing.
Neil Pickup: you know he's like this legendary oh we got a guy you know when the Georgii are speaking with such passion about a guy that that they've got and they believe in so much and that is pretty uh unknown to me really I've never met him in real life so and it is a different experience um
Neil Pickup: more interestingly as well, to really sort of build that same story, Adam Wojcicki, I find fascinating because he's a guy who's been in the sport, I don't know, probably six to eight years now, I would imagine. Probably less than that, but maybe last a few years. In that period of time that he's been around, I think I remember him saying that he'd been involved since Game of Arms. So when was that?
Neil Pickup: was game of arms on there was that like 2015 or something there or thereabouts but anyway we digress his his um performance against bojira was dominant and when you know how good uh bojira is i'm very interested to see where the roof is for for adam you know
Neil Pickup: Is he as strong as he looked? Does he have some weaknesses in other areas? I'm very, very keen to see that match. I think it's going to be probably one of the matches that people are less enthusiastic about unless you're in a hardcore fan perspective. Can I ask you something, Neil? What is dominance for you? Like, for example, like when you said that, like, like,
Engin Terzi: Adam dominated Bojidar. At the end, Bojidar gassed out. Bojidar couldn't pin him, but there were times that neither of them could go.
Neil Pickup: I think dominance is the ability to direct and to steer the match to where you want it to be in every occasion. And I think in that instance, that was what I saw. I saw from Adam that he was able to put the match, even when Boji tried to change it up and top roll. Boji's a very diverse puller. It's fair to say that at that point in time, they'd had a hard enough battle.
Neil Pickup: and an interesting level for it to be difficult and him to be a little gassed. And he was depleting at a faster rate because obviously Adam was a bigger, stronger man. But that gave Adam the ability to put the match where he wanted it to be and control and govern the match at will. My explanation of domination is just either just crushing the guy or just
Engin Terzi: have the full control and anytime you wanted to pin something like, I hope that Sandra is not going to get upset with me, but like, like from right from the round one, Devon versus Sandra's match. I see that like dominance. Dominance. Yeah. Devon was, was very much dominant with Sandra's direct the flow of the match, put it where we wanted it to be very, very impressive. Yeah. Whenever, whenever I think like Bojidar versus
Engin Terzi: adam i see the beginning very evenly matched and then one guessed out the other one just laid around uh like as you said later on we can say that uh domination but not not there is a there is a super stress russell tyrone jones can say it many times you know but thank you for what you do for our missing both of you thank you my friend thank you yeah
Engin Terzi: and okay so you are okay the problem not the problem the interesting thing is that whenever i talk with the georgians and whenever i talk with macho they all are super confident yeah they are super confident that you know like there is no chance yeah you know that that is surprising i would understand them to have a guy
Engin Terzi: that would be good enough 18 years old but would be good enough to pull adam and if they would say let's see what's going to happen but this guy is not bad don't underestimate but whenever an 18 years old guy just suddenly comes and they all expect him to dominate someone like adam wardenski yeah then then like it is it is interesting either they don't know what they are talking about or we don't know
Neil Pickup: Well, this is what I was just going to say. You do start to think.
Neil Pickup: What do they know that we don't know? I mean, let's be honest. You've got a proving pool within Georgii that is at an exceptional level. So if you look around Georgii, there are so many exceptional pullers across the weight classes. You know, a lot of guys that people don't know that are extremely strong. They've got a myriad of pullers that are very, very, very powerful. If you want to test yourself technically, you've got guys who are at the...
Neil Pickup: highest echelon in one school of technique let's take um a couple that are pulling here we've got zurab and if you want to hook and you go hook with zurab you know you're in a match because that kid can hook you know uh on the other side if you're looking for top roll i mean exactly the same suit warmed over isn't it you can go wherever you want to go in georgia and get a test test if you want to go for someone who's super diverse
Neil Pickup: if a kid goes and pulls with the ganari quick vina you're going to get a test in every area of the table so if you're looking for endurance who better than david samusha everything's covered so a guy's got a real question for you neil
Engin Terzi: like we know that you you're gonna go in 39 minutes because you have to go somewhere so i will just ask shortly like let's go to the next match because we don't know much about bacho so we only will wait and see yeah there is nothing to predict yeah and but since you talk about zura he's opening his raw visions yeah and and after watching zura against
Engin Terzi: brian stago that that's sergey bogoslov yeah bogoslov yeah yeah and some other guys did you rate zurab in your mind even higher than before yes yes for example would you pull against someone like patashinx a good match
Engin Terzi: That is a very difficult question, mate. I don't think he could, no. John Bersink, when he beat Zurab, even that time, he said it would be a good match. But Zurab today, either the level of East versus West is really incredible.
Neil Pickup: Or Zurab is now in all different level with the dominance that he show especially inside. I think you hit a nail on the head with the second thing there. I think that Zurab is pushing very, very hard now and he's really inspired and motivated.
Neil Pickup: When you were, I mean, probably a lot of the pullers in the chat and people in any sport that you're involved with, if you're very active and you're getting a lot of success and you're getting notoriety, it breeds an inner confidence. And it also breeds a desire to get yourself out there and do things. You fall in love with the sport again. And I think, you know, you're really seeing that at the moment. Zurab is flinging himself wholeheartedly into this thing. He looks ridiculous, doesn't he?
Neil Pickup: I mean, if you look at the condition of the lot, he's absolutely ridiculous. And the performance AMC was first class. As you say, you look at that class.
Neil Pickup: And it was ridiculous. Absolutely stuck to the rafters. I mean, guys across the piece in there who were fried and tested world-class killers from Krasimir to Tainov, Boguslov, you name it. They were... Together with Rob Vigent right now.
Neil Pickup: Rob is, let me break down Rob Vigit Jr. for people. Rob, for me, Rob is an underdog in this match. Why Rob is an underdog is for a couple of reasons. Firstly, inactivity. Are there not some people that just were so, like, for example, Jerry Cadarez came in with Genadi. He just said hello and then he won. There are a few of them.
Engin Terzi: like this yeah 100 and probably nobody like for example like i haven't been pulling for some time if i come back how much would you doubt me would you think that engine would pull
Engin Terzi: without really oh you sneaky bastard you know the answer to this engine because okay they know how to bring themselves to that stage ready because they have enough of experience i'm not saying that rob is one of them or is not but he's one of them i think he i think he is i think he's a bit like like you just described there with yourself yeah he's got an inherent level
Neil Pickup: when he's motivated and firing and i believe he may well be he's a bit like vitor belfort in the ufc so when one version of that guy shows up he's going to knock your head into the fifth row and then another guy can show up and he's less impressive and rob's very much that guy and rob can even be that guy within a match so he can start a match
Neil Pickup: you think okay we got a measured quantity this is what we're dealing with and something triggers him all of a sudden different guy shows up he's quite a he's a bit of a unicorn rob virgin but in terms of natural talent natural ability for the game he is as good as it gets he genuinely is his natural ability as an arm wrestler is as good as it gets i'm keen to see
Neil Pickup: this match a lot because I think that he's been working with some really solid arm wrestlers I wish I knew how much I know I've seen footage of him with Jerry on the practice table I believe he pulled with Paul um
Neil Pickup: I believe he's pulled with Doug Erlich. Various guys have been out and done some work with Rob. Maybe Brandon, not sure about Alsessa, whether he's got over there. No, they did pull. I know those guys are chucking themselves into it, mate. So you've got a situation there where if he comes in really invigorated and he's learned some lessons from stylistically where John could hang Zurab up a little bit,
Neil Pickup: Rob's got a huge size advantage, just as a man. Structurally, he's massive. He's got very, very long, very big, very dominant hand and wrist. For me, that's his optimum and primary weapon. I think his hand and wrist are exceptional, truly exceptional. And if he can sort of...
Neil Pickup: balance on Zurab's wrist a little bit. I think the biggest danger is that he goes too backward and tries to just utilize back pressure primarily as he's going to defeat the guy. That would be a mistake. I think it is in between. I think anyone who wants to beat Zurab needs to have full control of his pronators.
Engin Terzi: And at the same time, if you do like this, he will press you this way. If you go out too much this way, he will hook you and beat you. So you need to go in between. That is why when people said, Engin, why did you say Chance Bacho against Zurab? Zurab is going to kill him. And I said, either I or you guys don't know about arm wrestling. If I know arm wrestling, I'm not saying Chance is going to win, but there is no way that match is going to be easy.
Engin Terzi: And in my mind, because I'm an organizer, I cannot say my prediction, but in my mind, I thought that
Neil Pickup: chance because of his style he is yeah i think which i know i predicted chance is the winner uh yeah i have chance picked heavily stylistically giga chad's a brilliant matchup for chat but chances yeah absolutely tailor-made to to beat him rob yeah less quick nowhere near the explosivity in that way rob's more take your hand jump on you and that is an option for him too
Neil Pickup: that is an option for him without strap just climb and press is an option and it's a dangerous option for rob so rob is very much alive alive in this match i've got him as like a 60 40 underdog uh i i actually love zurab but you know who's corner i'm in i want rob virgin to win the match i'm a huge job vision fan personally i'm a personal friend of rob for many years i would love rob virgin to win the match are you coming here for july and october event as well
Engin Terzi: I'm coming every time an East versus West is on and you end off. If the day is missing, big part is missing. That is it. Thank you, my friend. That is a big grow both Engin and Neil. I had something I wanted to bring up when I was on with John. What do you guys think is the way to get our messaging in schools at the elementary school level? I think it is the best way to grow the future. Erlich, thank you for your
Engin Terzi: My friend, elementary school, yes, it can be, but we need to be very, very careful. There needs to be some people who needs to do interaction. Otherwise, their parents will be complaining.
Engin Terzi: a lot of arm breaks and you cannot just leave the kids by themselves that way. No, it would need to be handled like a combat sport, like rugby, like boxing, a really good heavy contact sport. It's not that it can't be done, it's just more hard to implement. My friend, the surprising thing is that when they are in the class pulling by themselves during the breaks, they don't break their arms.
Neil Pickup: No, we never did. I have never seen in school. Maybe there are some people did it, but there are some successful programs getting tables into school. Charlie Minnell was involved with one of those. Heidi Amberson back in the day in Sweden did a lot of work with schools over there. They have a great program. I don't know the situation over in Kazakhstan, what age they start kids off.
Neil Pickup: But I think if it's managed in the right way, it can be very effective. I think there's an optimum age for kids to get involved, and it's probably somewhere around the 13-14 mark in terms of competition. 2019, 34,000 kids competed in school competitions all over Turkey. I mean, wow, that's unbelievable. Yeah, yeah.
Neil Pickup: and let's go let's go you are saying 60 40 for drop yeah i've got 60 40 uh for for zurab in my in my head in my heart it's 60 40 rvj let's go yeah come on rob yeah let's go because we have like nine more matches and you don't have you only have 30 minutes let's go we'll probably still be on here at 2 a.m i'll ever i'll have missed everything i've got to do i'll be late for everything i've got to go to and we'll be still here doing this if you were by me i wouldn't let you go anywhere
Engin Terzi: that's true i know that yeah but right now you are there all you need to do is just click the button and go away so i cannot stop you anyway so how about how about brandon assessor versus david i'm going to start here by just saying good for you brandon el sasa that you've got a shot and you got some record this this guy deserves it big time he is
Neil Pickup: know like the guy that graphs his ass off and deserves to get some recognition that is brandon l sesson this fellow back in the days of the wal he was the guy that was there that was begging for recognition that was pleading to be and he was there working putting the hard hours in you would look at his facebook feed you would speak to the guy and he was grafting he was working hard and he has had a slow steady
Neil Pickup: but very, very clear ascendancy in the game. And I am extremely happy to see that guy get a shot. And I hope he can deliver something from it. Again, I see him as an underdog. He's professional. Whenever I look at him, the guy has one of the reasons that I invited him, one of them
Engin Terzi: And the one that convinced me is victory against Craig Tuller. Which is a hell of a win. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Craig Tuller is this level cooler, you know. And the second reason is that the guy has respect for his own goals, for arm wrestling, for what he's doing. Yeah, he's professional. Just look at him. He is riding his own...
Engin Terzi: story yes yeah i i love this kind of people these guys they do like like like yeah another one pauline pauline let's just look at him how he prepares himself to do events guys like
Neil Pickup: 99 like he's more professional than 99.9 of the armrests on this earth this guy paul lynn yeah and he's a model isn't he he's a new one yeah he's the paul lynn's the model pupil he's the guy that he's first to work last home he's that guy he's immersed himself in the in the sport you know to right so the water's right at his nose there's no further for him to go um paul
Neil Pickup: the condition of that last, at the last East versus West was unbelievable. Unbelievable. You know, also the bravery you showed in that match against Rustam, changing things up when he was taking a bit of an ass. It was kind of late after two rounds, you know,
Engin Terzi: I expected him to try that after round one, but he tried two rounds that way. But it's so hard when you feel like you're being beaten in quite dominant fashion. Just dust yourself down and think, you know what? He had no other choice, my friend. No, he didn't.
Engin Terzi: but a lot of people don't have that choice but they still don't take it they still don't run headlong into it i mean paul has no reason to not to take it the paul almost injured not almost he injured john birthing inside you remember john's forearm after i remember john talking about that yes also i mean this guy is serious force and probably he is one of the most explosive guys
Neil Pickup: the most that starts is just very explosive and one of the key things that east versus west has done and the resurgence of arm wrestling generally is doing is that they're seeing the level you know whenever you raise the bar in any sport whenever someone sets something yes that's you know the four minute mile the bob beam and long jump eddie hall's 500 you name it somebody does something man on the moon moment
Neil Pickup: then the competitive nature of people will always try to hit the bar. Where's the gold stuff? Look at now, we got, you know, Morozov going, right, I'm going to lift some crazy weight because I saw this guy do it. And we've all been there, you know?
Neil Pickup: If you're the type of guy that wants to go that extra mile, that wants to prove yourself, then you will go out of your way to try and knock over and get to where that bar, that level is. Brandon Ellsessor is doing that. You see the guy, sometime I'll be led there and I'm checking my Facebook feed and up it comes. There's Brandon doing something else in the gym, trying to chisel himself, get himself ready. One thing I can tell you, I have no doubt in my mind that
Neil Pickup: the manner in which east versus west has changed the game uh and the resurgence of the sport has changed the game that there is a new level of arm wrestler coming and these guys are the the people the the men and the women around the world who are able to and committed to dedicating their time non-stop into prepping diligently with a different level of focus and
Neil Pickup: I think Paul Linn is one of those guys. I think Brandon is one of those guys. And it's good to see. I like to see that where these guys are coming through. God knows where the level is going to be in, you know, five. I mean, look at Baccio. Where the hell is this guy going to go? He's 18. And he's confident that he's going to come over and crack Adam. Neil, that guy was 14 years old at the side table. 14 years old. He was U15 category. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: At the side table, he was beating the senior guys. And he was telling me, just look at that guy, 14 years old, what he's doing. I just go there. He was beating the senior guys like this. I was like, wow. And now whenever I think that this guy is now 18 years old, then I'm thinking that he is a freak for sure. Let's see what's going to happen. So how about, listen, just to make sure, you are not going in one hour. It's what you said.
Engin Terzi: Let's go and you get the boat. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Because I need to cut you because the only eight minutes happen. We have like so many matches. Tell me about tell me about Brandon versus listen, I will tell you something. I will admit, you know, I said many times, but there is no human being on this earth that I enjoy to talk about missing more than you. It's because we've done it so much. It's a track record and there's no one right. And Bowen enjoys talking to less.
Engin Terzi: My friend, just talk about, okay, there's two superchats I will read. Go for it. Javier Martinez, I think. This is how you pronounce, I hope. Thank you for your superchat. Great to see Engin Reppin, the Alpha Empire Southern California arm-wrestling t-shirt. Thank you, my friend. Thanks to Derek Smith for the t-shirt. And there is Koyotek. Thank you for your superchat.
Engin Terzi: Am I alone in thinking Devon is making a climb to go after Devon again? I just think he's on a different level than he has ever been for both of you. My friends, that is for sure. Whenever I say this, even to Devon's face, Devon doesn't like to talk about it.
Engin Terzi: has everything that you just said on his mind, but back somewhere. But he wants to go one after another. So when he has Genadi, he doesn't want to talk about Dennis. When he has Dennis, he doesn't want to talk Hermes. When he has Hermes, he doesn't want to talk Levan. But eventually, yes, that's where he's trying to go. I think it's the right move.
Neil Pickup: I think it's the right move for him and for the sport and for the fans. I think everybody wants to see Devon perform and do what he does. A lot of excitement is generated by that. And, yeah, I think there's a lot of matches out there for Devon across the classes, you know. I mean, I was excited when he was going to the lower weight classes. I was really excited to see him pull such as Kurt Aghali. I love Kurt Aghali on the BIAF, mate.
Engin Terzi: good again that's a great arm wrestler right there let me tell you right now god what are my friends right now i'm not saying that like he can beat everyone whenever we say that the best arm master people would oh there is that one you know that's not what we are talking about might be that guy no no
Engin Terzi: No, no, no. What I'm just trying to say is that you need to judge every arm wrestler for his own size. This guy is incredibly explosive. This guy has one of the best endurance. This guy's stable IQ up there with John Bersink and Devon Larratt. This guy can pull in any position. Deadlifts, shoulder press.
Engin Terzi: top row, side pressure. I mean, whatever. The first time he ever pulled against someone like Michael Todd, he pulled like he has been pulling against open and top row top rollers for like decades. You know, he was dead. I mean, I just can't say enough good things about that guy. Like whenever I watch him, because people talk negative about Michael, but Michael is one of the most dangerous opponents
Engin Terzi: that you can face technically i'm talking about that guy yeah i mean yeah and then defeating and countering everything michael does right away that whenever i look at that like whenever i say this about
Neil Pickup: on that web it also i also talk highly about michael because what amazed me is on guard to be that effective against someone like michael yeah so i was amazing to watch their first round was amazing to watch but let me tell you now all of them all of them all all of them is only the size he is because god was scared of making that model any bigger that's what happened there
Engin Terzi: i'll tell you what can you imagine that guy mora's off-sized oh yeah remember at the press conference we had michael at the right side after one and a half day he put all the weight back order everything and then whenever i look at left side i was like i know arm wrestling is not about size but i'm not talking about bodybuilders i'm talking about michael todd yeah and then whenever i look at on guard where
Engin Terzi: like how is it gonna happen but the guy just performs like he he you may like his arm is that size and he's talking like his performance is this big you know oh he's incredible man he's okay let's go let's go to the brandon versus uh david match so there is a couple of things that influence my uh opinion on this match okay
Neil Pickup: experience is one of them however however diligently you prep to go for that big show once you're up there for the first time and it's a different experience and a different rule set and a different way of doing things it's emir there and the reflection emir up you go do yeah however diligently you prep you can only get so far the reality of the situation is slightly different
Neil Pickup: And it can create a moment for you where you're a little bit rabbit in the headlights. And the more you become familiar with the promotion, the more you become familiar with the rules set, with the feel of things, with the lay of the land, where you are in the hotel, everything, all those disparate elements go to make a different look. And this is Brandon's first time. It is not Davit Samocia's first time. I think that plays heavily in favour of Samocia.
Neil Pickup: I think how we talked earlier about Zurab, I think Davit's also a guy that is currently growing into the promotion and growing into himself at the moment. I think there was a real air of confidence around him the last time out. And he is also one of the guys that I don't think Brandon's going to be able to outlast. And that's a primary... Does it depend on position?
Neil Pickup: It does depend on position, yes, but we've seen that Brandon will lose his wrist willingly. I think if he lost his wrist willingly or lost the control of the hand and wrist willingly against Davit, it would be a bad move. But Davit is going inside, my friend. Yeah. Brandon is going to only drop his hand. Not much stops in a hook.
Neil Pickup: I think Brandon might try and just dive straight underneath him and press him straight down. That's what I believe may happen. We will see. But I believe that's what Brandon may do. If he looks to top-roll him, can't top-roll him, and gets put into the hook. Brandon has a chance in the hook. He's very strong, but I don't think he can pin Davit straight off the bat, off the marker, if he can. Amazing. I don't think he can. That's my honest opinion. I think Davit Samushia is extremely strong.
Neil Pickup: And if he can pin him in the first two rounds, I don't think he can pin him in the third. Because I think it would be hard enough for him to work through Davit. I actually think that what we'll see is Brandon going for a top roll, Davit going for a hook. Davit's extremely hard to top roll, as we've clearly seen so many times.
Neil Pickup: Daniel's a bit of a weirdo. And also Daniel top rolls in a weird fashion. He doesn't top roll anything like Brandon. Brandon's also not a supremely explosive top roller. He's the kind of guy that drop wrist pistol grips and tries to force his way out. I really struggle to see him doing that successfully with Davit. If he can. Wow.
Engin Terzi: Neil, you know, I will tell you something interesting. See, now, I tried to do some, like, there was a page for the underdog. See, nobody is saying that because I'm trying to find a way for, and I really believe, for Brandon to win. I tried to explain. But whenever I say this, nobody is saying, oh, Engin hated Eastern guys.
Engin Terzi: But whenever, when people says that Devon is heavily favored and Genadi is going to lose. And whenever I try to do the same thing for Genadi, what if Devon goes open on top? If Genadi does this and people go, Engin hates Devon so much. He wants him to lose. He hates the Western guys. Why this is happening that whenever I do like, like, for example, whenever I say that, no, Cairns have
Engin Terzi: good good good possibility to withdraw and then nobody says you hate georgians so i try to balance everything you understand like i like i try to how to say if one of those guys look underdog if i said this match it means that i believe there is a possibility i would never set a match that there is no chance at all i don't you can ask me can you not make closer matchups
Engin Terzi: I can. But whenever we are mostly focusing on East and West, it is not that easy. No, it's... If I were to West and West, East and East, it would be much easier. So I want people to understand that if I am trying to play devil's advocate and hide the matches or something, don't just come with the hatred and with the prejudiced mind. Oh, you hate this guy and this is what you are doing. I mean, come on.
Engin Terzi: Some people are going to do that just to wind you up. Or like my friends, you know. For example, go and ask Pauline, you know. Yeah. On social media, you never get away from the guys that are just going to troll. That's what they're going to do. No, no, no. I'm not trying to listen. Unfortunately, we're in that era. That part people don't understand. I am not trying to get out of these things. But I am.
Engin Terzi: trying to express myself so maybe people will learn because maybe some people are doing this unintentionally or some people are not doing it but whenever they see these kind of things they think it's right so i express myself about why i'm doing the things that i am doing then people say oh okay this is what england is trying to do those people can still continue whatever they want
Neil Pickup: you know what is interesting about this match mate yeah heart and desire and i think that that is a very and this is probably what you had in your mind correct me if i'm wrong you know you may like you say do you think he's got a chance yeah you think he's got a chance and i agree he's got a chance i think that uh for me perhaps uh brandon's biggest weapon and
Neil Pickup: Some people may disagree. If you have Paul in here, Rob in here, Doug in here, the guys that are pulling with him, they'll know much better where Brandon is right now. But when I look at Brandon and I try and make assessments about arm wrestlers in my mind, what I see from Brandon is that the guy is...
Neil Pickup: extraordinarily committed to the point where he will go out on his shield regardless we saw it in the two-year match at the monster factory where he went absolutely balls out and outlasted craig in a horrible position you know yeah in in an area where craig particularly craig is very proficient and yet
Neil Pickup: brandon just dogged it out he just was the bigger dog in the fight he just wanted it more and and that is one of or in my opinion the primary weapon for brandon i think his heart is as good as anyone's and if he can get tied to the you know if he can bust out which i think he can get into a strap force the match to be stalled where daffodil can't find his
Neil Pickup: exact position is a little bit out of shape little ugly puts a little wear and tear on him i think brandon may be strong enough to balance the match enough to turn it into a dog fight and if he can that's where his opportunity comes i think the guy is a dog and i think the guy will try and outlast
Neil Pickup: anyone and god knows he's been encouraged by that in his previous wins how many times have we seen brandon gutted out and win and purely and simply on balls and heart and determination my friend i will ask you something you know that that craig's hook inability you know that how he moves quickly forward and goes around your arm whenever i like before i watched that match brandon and craig
Engin Terzi: i thought with that quick move he was going to hook him but whenever craig tried it and then ranu survived with his pronator back pressure low hand top row then then i saw the possibility the same exact move where also
Engin Terzi: Davit can't hook him. Prokopchuk, Prokopchuk. Okay, yeah, I'm with you. I don't know where you're going. So you're thinking that Davit won't be able to get his position. I'm not saying he won't be able to get, but I see a possibility there for him to stack there. And if he stacks there, Brandon is also a guy that Davit has incredible endurance. But Brandon also looks like someone, especially if he's in his own position,
Engin Terzi: guy doesn't give up either no that that is why i'm expecting if if david hooks him i think david is clear favorite my opinion that's why he's 64 favorite for me because i i there's two reasons i was saying earlier the big thing is brandon
Neil Pickup: It has an ability to outlast and outwill most of his opponents. I am concerned whether he's got the ability to do that with this guy when the guy is in a more dominant position. He's a little more A-side because Davit is one of those guys that has natural endurance, got excellent endurance. But...
Neil Pickup: If the match turns ugly, just an ugly, raw position with both men not where they want to be, I think Brandon comes back into it a little there. I'm hoping that the strength gap is close. I'm hoping that Brandon's heart and desire as the matches roll forward
Neil Pickup: Give him the opportunity to make it a dogfight. Because I think it'll be an unbelievably long match if that happens. Yeah, if it stops in the same place. Yeah, if it stops in an ugly shape, an ugly match, it's going to be really entertaining. A straight-up orthodox match, I think, Daf, it's a 60-point. I want to share another excitement that I felt whenever I did the podcast with Daniel.
Engin Terzi: and Douglas there whenever I asked about Samushia versus Brandon match and Daniel said that he wants uh Davit Samushia to win because he said he wants to be the one to beat Davit no no no no listen do you know what I mean do you see that the guy has a dream yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: I don't know if it's going to happen or not, but I am so happy by organizing these events that are goals for these people to train for. That makes me really happy. Whenever I saw that, I was like, wow, Daniel, what I do there created a dream for Daniel. That is what I wanted to do right from the beginning. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: what you've achieved uh with east versus west is wonderful really is for all for all arm wrestlers we need to understand one thing neil whatever i did first of all we did all together like imagine you are not announcing something is missing there there are very good announcers as well but no disrespect to anyone but you are you are the best in the business you are you are not only like i can find someone from europe
Engin Terzi: who can do announcers in a few languages and everything maybe maybe better than you but if it's a different language not not as an arm master because he will not know one percent of what you know about arm wrestling you understand so you are there not doing a business you are reading arm wrestling you are there when you do the announcement you are breathing like you are naturally the there is a table
Engin Terzi: are pets there yeah they're hand-packed there's referee you know pick up it's just like a part of it it just bring the best guy from the ufc the announcer hey guy will not belong there you know what i mean yeah so that is what i wanted to say so let's go he wants to be up there with my elbow on the path not gonna lie uh yeah to be the guy with my elbow on the pad i do miss that yeah let's go
Neil Pickup: Let's go to Prokopchuk versus Douglas. You are a big Prokopchuk fan. I'm a big fan of both these guys. Both these guys. Doug Early, I've got a real affinity to as well. I really like Doug. He's a great lad. Talked to Doug a lot recently. A lot of time, a lot of respect for Doug. Doug proved me wrong. Stronger than I thought.
Neil Pickup: Wouldn't it be something if Doug Erlich could pull this off? I mean, who sees that coming? Because right now, Daniel, that weight class is, I mean, you don't see many guys that you think is going to be that. Yeah, 75 kilos. 75 kilos with left arm. He is the best. Right arm, he is one of the best. Yeah, he's human with the right.
Engin Terzi: Now, in 75 kilos, again, something more than human. But whenever you come to the category that he's going to pull now, 85, we can't consider him as the best. Here's a question for you. Do you think there is a heavier favourite on the card in the minds of the armwrestling fans than Daniel Prokopcio?
Neil Pickup: Who do you think of all these matches with more people saying probably Daniel's going to get there? I reckon a lot of people in the arm wrestling hardcore will have huge belief in Daniel because of the fact that every time that you step to it, Daniel takes some beating. At any level, that man is unbelievably strong. And I think that gives Doug...
Engin Terzi: Huge motivation. I think Doug is working his ass off. Yeah, he is as motivated as Pauline. Yes. Brandon. And I will tell you something. I, of course, I care the level of the artist as well. But nothing excites me more than an arm wrestler that lives for that dream.
Engin Terzi: Do you understand? I see that with Douglas. I see that with Pauline. I see that with Brandon. You understand? I see whenever I see, of course, some others as well. But there are some who are a little bit satisfied with their success. But there are some who have dreams to climb up. So people who need to climb up have more hunger. Pauline is the title holder. But even he knows that
Engin Terzi: he needs to do more like now he has sasha like incredible level of opponents so pauline is the well-deserved champion of east versus west but he still knows that he needs to prove more
Engin Terzi: and because of this i see him incredibly motivated incredibly did you see his back pictures right whenever he he posted we post that people says this is not bodybuilding competition my friends it is not bodybuilding if you put their bodybuilders back then i would i would agree with you but if if pauline has that back it doesn't mean he's gonna win but it means that he is in
Engin Terzi: some dangerous shape. If you see Devon Larratt in this shape, this big arm, bicep like this, you can say it's not about the size. But if you are thinking that if this guy is Devon with that size, it means something. Because that guy was already dangerous. If he is in that physical shape, that also gives, it doesn't mean he's going to win. But it just shows that
Neil Pickup: the guy is in a serious shape yeah he's in brutal condition and as we've touched on it a couple of times tonight i think there's a a real um desire amongst the lads that are coming over from the us and they're working as a unit and they're putting in the hard the hard hours and
Neil Pickup: i do believe that that will be a trend that continues whether or not they get success here this time i hope that they just keep buoyed by the effort you know um and enjoy what they're doing and i'm really excited to see doug have a crack
Neil Pickup: doug has got mega confidence right now mate the lad is confident i mean he's really confident and he's a big guy at the weight he's a big man at that weight and he's looked i mean he was so impressive with ray so impressive you know he and ray is no bum let me tell you now no no he's good yeah but the problem is the like there are some guys that are
Engin Terzi: highly intelligent. And when, when your opponent is very intelligent, intelligent, then, then it's also another, like, if he is not all about power, you know, Daniel is a doctor, he's a orthopedic surgeon. This guy, this guy, very smart guy. Just, just watch his videos about how to train or something. He still needs to learn something.
Engin Terzi: But you can see that there are not many people who are understanding arm wrestling by themselves and progressing. I have been watching Daniel and his video. He's been isolated in Moldova. This is one of those guys that figured out about arm wrestling by himself. Those people are dangerous people. You understand? But there are other people dangerous, but they learn from others. Nothing is better than
Neil Pickup: what you figure out if you can do that everything by yourself especially if you are highly smart yeah the power of original thought is a dangerous concept if somebody can come in and reinvent themselves in their own manner around their own strengths arm wrestling your way is everything it's critically important um it's a great match up this one it's one that i'm emotionally invested you know how much of a fan of daniel i am and how i've always been um
Neil Pickup: I'm excited to see if Doug's belief is contagious. Because Doug Hurlick is coming to win. The man is coming to win. There is no doubt in that lad's mind that he could win. Someone who is that confident, that focused,
Neil Pickup: and doesn't accept anything else it doesn't mean he's gonna win but for sure it means he's gonna bring 100 percent oh my god he's gonna bring it yeah yeah yeah yeah i speak to doug when there's not you know just just chatting to him on whatsapp or whatever and that lad believes in himself he's got every right to he's very very strong he's a bigger man
Neil Pickup: he doesn't he hasn't read uh you know daniel's script he doesn't know that daniel thinks that he's going to be the power guy he thinks that doug thinks that he can be the the man who initiates he thinks he's the man with the top end strength advantage this is a man that the other day i saw a picture he was dead lifting 316 kilograms now that does that correlate to arm wrestling not at all but what do you think
Neil Pickup: an 82 kilo body weight i mean 116 kilo yes i know wow no kilos i mean okay
Neil Pickup: some people will say that he doesn't make a champion but it only gives you an idea that that how strong as a person exactly it's like you were just saying about paul lynn and his back it's the same soup warmed over what it tells you is that the man is brutally strong right now and it's not like he doesn't know how to arm wrestle so you do wonder what
Neil Pickup: he's bringing in you you wonder what we're gonna see from doug the last time doug showed up and was pulling ray i had re i had ray as a favorite i thought ray would be able to pull him into a trench war bleed him out and win that match no personal feeling against dog now now
Neil Pickup: Doug believes he's way stronger. Doug believes that he is coming in and can do something with Daniel. Wouldn't that be something? If Doug can come in here and can win this match, what an opportunity for Doug that is. I mean, what an opportunity. He leaves Turkey with a very, very different reputation if he can get something against this guy. Because Daniel Prokopcik is no joke. I said the matches, the rest is up to the athletes. And even...
Neil Pickup: out of five six matches if one or two underdog wins and surprise the world then still you know it is a big day for arm wrestling you know it's so much more than that though the excitement of this thing let's say right hypothetically that on any given saturday we you know we we all tune in to watch an east versus west event and every match is a run over
Neil Pickup: who gives a really the match potential is half the battle it's not even just the day itself it's this because i don't know about anybody else in the chat but i'm buzzing my tits off
Engin Terzi: I am absolutely excited as hell about this thing. I can't wait. I'm going to Semyon. I'm in England. We're three weeks out and I'm buzzing now. I'm figuring on starting swimming. Neil, that is why you are coming to Istanbul. Not for business. I am 100% sure that you would like to be there even if you are not announcing. 100% I would.
Engin Terzi: yeah boring your ass off in reception talking yeah i i love that yeah i love that yeah see whenever i see you now how excited you are it motivates me yeah because it's quality some like hateful comments trying to discourage in me things like that and i'm like sometimes like why am i doing this
Engin Terzi: Because I wanted to really, really help the sport, you know, help the athletes, help everything, you know. And then whenever I see those people, some people are sending here to write all this. And then I'm like sometimes discouraged. And then I look at the message that John Burton writing all those positive things.
Neil Pickup: when Devon is saying when you are saying and all those true fans when they are sporty now whenever I see your excitement now yeah yeah it's just like it's enough for me it's enough on the day itself you know when you're at events because whenever you get at a quality arm wrestling event like that all the fans of the sport know that feeling when you wake up and you want the thing to start
Neil Pickup: You can't eat your breakfast. I'm not even arm wrestling. I can't eat my breakfast. I just want to go downstairs.
Neil Pickup: And let me tell you, I ain't shy of eating. I didn't get this physique through not eating. But the day of East versus West, I don't want to eat anything. I just want to go and let's get it done. Let's get this party started. Let's have it. And that's what it's about. And the whole thing from when I land on Thursday to when I go home on Sunday, I am going to be ready to go. I can't wait. Let's go. I love that. I love that, Neil. I love that. The healing is incredible.
Engin Terzi: I don't know how to read Nuke one or NWUK one. Yeah, NWUK one. He's always in the chats. Top dude. Thank you. Thank you for your support. Gents, don't get to catch Engin on a live too often. So just saying thanks and showing my support. Engin want you to know that you and the work you do with East versus West are really appreciated. I'm a big fan. Thanks. My friend, trust me, if I still continue this,
Engin Terzi: like people in the chat that's sports and some other people who are sporty trust me only because of that i continue thank you very much and let's go to another one where did we so let's go we did rob vision drop dog versus pro cop and adam barco and let's go to do alejan versus cody merits you know alejan i mean 95 kilo just say maximum 100 kilo but this guy
Engin Terzi: We saw against Petrenko. Petrenko was 10 kilo heavier than him. And we saw Petrenko beating Tariqan in 2019 Zlotitur. Of course, Tariqan is now also stronger, but Petrenko is 10 kilo heavier and he's also stronger. And 95 kilo Alizhan within the WAF wars.
Engin Terzi: and so not many people not many people can pull against him in his own weight category it needs to be a title match of course it's gonna because the guy but 95 kilo probably him versus artem kaino would be a good one yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: Ertem Tainov, if you remember, beat Sasho at 2021 World. Ertem Tainov is a guy that I know has come into East vs West under different circumstances, and I think people will love him. Those fans of the sport that aren't familiar with Tainov... I want to set a 95-pilot title match between Ali Canmurado and Ertem Tainov in July.
Neil Pickup: book my ticket let's go oh my god that's an amazing matchup see we are doing everything for our dreams you know yeah it's incredible yeah yeah let me tell you now ali jean is unbelievably impressive athlete so impressive
Neil Pickup: that I believe that he is a heavy favourite in this match. And that is not to take anything away from Kody. Kody's a very proficient bowler. He's a giant. And he's one of the loveliest guys in the sport and extremely experienced. And time and time again, Kody's stepped up there and he's proved people wrong and he's got very impressive results at WAF, at tournaments all around the world. This guy is no joke.
Neil Pickup: the fact that i see alijan as such a heavy favorite underlines how much i rate that guy i think muratov is unbelievably dangerous i think his speed and dynamism is off the charts and his ability to go first to react first is the difference maker in this match as i see it if i was in cody merritt's corner
Neil Pickup: I'd be telling him, and I would tell him right now, do everything in your power to stop this match before it starts. Almost go out of character. Kody's like the fairest, most lovely guy in the world. But I kind of think that he's got to try and be the big bully in this match and literally try and take everything before the start. He better be. Exactly that, because I'll tell you what. I told him, he asked me what's my opinion whenever I asked about this offer. And he said,
Neil Pickup: Like, you don't have much to gain, you have a lot to lose. Yeah, don't let Alizhan hit you. If this guy hits you, it's like getting cracked on the top lip with a ball-pain hammer. You just do not want this guy to hit first. And I do worry for the outcome in that respect, particularly as we know that...
Neil Pickup: Merritt's had issues with his arm before. He had damage in his left arm with the topi match. I think he had some issues following that. Hopefully, he's 100% fit. Alizhan is a brutal hitter. Unbelievably venomous hitter. And I think that Kody Merritt's got to get
Neil Pickup: his bully shoes on and try and make this thing stop before it starts he's got to use the signs make himself awkward make himself difficult to reach if he can do that maybe there's something there but i've got alijan as a heavy favorite every favorite alijan in my opinion is a heavy favorite in this match every favorite they understand but you are saying heavy favorite i believe so yeah i think i think the difference maker is the dynamism off the start
Neil Pickup: I think that guy hit so hard, so furiously that it is a big deal. Will his wrist handle the pronator and back pressure of Kody? We're about to find out. It's the size that gives Kody Merritt the opportunity. And we're talking about a true giant here. He's a huge guy. Maybe if he can bully the match and he can make it so that he can expose the hand and wrist, then he's got something.
Neil Pickup: I don't know whether he can. I think Kody's got to be a little out of character. I think he's got to boss the thing. Bully it. Be awkward. Be horrible. Take a leaf out of Devon Larratt's book and win everything. Really go for it in the setup. Try to make yourself awkward. Try to make yourself elusive. Devon't let Alizhan find a position where he's comfortable. I hope he does that. I think that Alizhan will be...
Engin Terzi: really out of the blocks i really do i'm not sure i'm not sure if i mean if his wrist handles the back pressure of cody then then possible if his wrist just whenever he hits the side way and if his wrist gets banded then i don't know i see that the possibility you know the interesting thing though with alejan i think i figure like he's one of these guys that you when you think there's no more he's got more
Engin Terzi: Oh, it depends on position. Yeah, yeah, I saw that. I saw that the way that
Engin Terzi: He hit sideways, he couldn't finish and he went to the shoulder pressure. He went to deep hoop and then he went open arm top roll. The guy is just fighting there. You cannot say that you put this guy in this position and he's going to lose. But we didn't see him when his wrist is bent back. And not with a guy that big. This is a giant. Kody Merritt is a giant. Yeah. And that's why Kody has a shot.
Neil Pickup: Kody has a shot. I mean, he has a shot, but to me, it's a slimmer shot. You know what I mean? I do think Alizhan right now... We will see. We will see. I hope that people, whenever I talk, that
Engin Terzi: like a eastern guy has favorite favorite not favorite but has chance that people say oh you hate these western guys now i try to balance with for kodi and people i hope you're doing a bad job here then all right everybody's gonna think i hate all the bloody westerns but i haven't given anyone as a favorite yet from us you hate the kazakh guys that's why you're trying to make kodi people are just like okay whatever let's go to the next one arif versus desire look at the match
Engin Terzi: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Guys, I cannot put it to the gallery mode when there are two people. It says that there needs to be only a minimum three with my phone. It says that way. And so we tried it, but it doesn't work. This is a fascinating match.
Neil Pickup: wow this is a this is one of those that i see so much this is like the the how i closed down the whole muratoff body merit match and i think you know you can see this match going on your mind now i say does that i don't know and ari
Engin Terzi: In your mind, you can picture this man going every direction. Arif is flashing him. Or this, I don't know, he's just jumping and stopping him in the hook. Or Arif is going in the strap halfway on the strap. This, I don't know, with back pressure, stop him. You can see all these possibilities, but you just don't know which one is going to happen. Exactly that. Wow, I'm struggling with this one. This is...
Neil Pickup: I don't know which way to go. If I was... Bloody hell. I would give top-end strength advantage to Dzeranov. I would give dynamism, home crowd advantage. Absolutely indelible spirit. Desire to win.
Neil Pickup: to i mean how can you go against arif for that i mean the guy is he's lit slight favorite probably arif wow if the thing stops so if the thing stops and turns into a grinder i go with ziranoff
Engin Terzi: But does it also depend, you know, what position he stops? Big time. Like, big time, yeah. Yeah, if he's halfway losing and lost his wrist or something, then... Yeah, if Zoranoff's lost his wrist, I think it's over. For me, I think Arif is a lot better than people think. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A lot more dangerous than people think. Arif flashed Genadi Kvikvinia at the European some years ago.
Neil Pickup: Yeah, I've got Arif as a slight favourite based on that unbelievable ability to just blast off the start. And he's got better technical range than people think. He's got unbelievable aggression and desire. He's slightly underpowered compared with Zoranoff, in my opinion. I'd say Zoranoff's like a... He's probably 60-40 in favour of Zoranoff for top end.
Neil Pickup: position for position. But I still think Arif might have enough to get the job done. And I think the venom off the starts will be a big thing. God, that's a tough match to call though. Okay, I understand. Basically, you are saying that Arif has chance to flash pin. Is that a no? But is that a no?
Engin Terzi: because of having more fourth power. If somehow he stops the match in a balanced position, then he may outlast Arif and win. This is basically what we are seeing. Yeah. And I think both have the top end because of the fact that
Neil Pickup: Just to crystallize a little bit more, I think because of the fact that Arif has so much ferocity on his hits, there's a danger there, a danger that he could overcommit on one of them and put himself in a bad spot. He almost needs to be a little measured. But he's good enough that if he gets that control and he opens, he gets a chink of daylight to find what he wants, that he could make this a convincing win. Because Arif is...
Engin Terzi: that is dangerous very better than all of these guys that we are mentioning on this card are dangerous for their own ways yes let's go to the next one um vitally la latin versus tobias i got the latin as a favorite i've i have however a lot of belief in the hand and wrist
Neil Pickup: of Sporrong and the explosivity and the evolving force that is Tobias Sporrong Tobias I think um how do you see how do you see Laletin in technical way how do you see Laletin beating Tobias like upper on his wrist yeah or the side pressure I think you'll make himself very very difficult to uh oh you beauty I feel like Evan I've just got
Neil Pickup: Boom. She's looking after me. She knows I've got to go out, you see. And she knew that my mate Engin would keep me on the phone for the rest of that. When you are talking, I do do something similar, you know. Lovely darts. So basically, I think that the height advantage, the leverage advantage that Vitalii's got gives him a real weapon and an opportunity to make himself very difficult to grab hold of.
Neil Pickup: I think the more proficient arm wrestler, left-handed, is actually Tobias. Pound per pound, or frame per frame, if you will. So you're saying that Valet is going to topple Tobias Frist? I think he'll try to make himself really hard to reach, and I think he'll believe that Tobias might open himself up by being too aggressive. That's an interesting dynamic for me, because Tobias Sporrong is so...
Neil Pickup: very, very quick off the start that it can go two ways. He can either overcommit and overextend himself, or he can blast into a really dominant position and make this look like a pretty solid victory. Tobias Sprung is very much alive in this one. When Laletin is just dropping his hand, you know, like this and pulling the strap and the high option typo, you know, obvious.
Neil Pickup: and then lalatin's low hand i don't know if he's gonna go that way as he usually does is there any way that somehow obvious knows something to lalatin's wrist yeah if i well again if i was in tobias's corner i would tell him if he likes to pull with his knuckles up i would definitely pull knuckles high and believe in his believe in the drive up the shoulder keep your knuckles really high if um if vitaly starts to go for the for the for the low hand pistol grip
Neil Pickup: I think that if Tobias keeps his knuckles really high and can blast hard to the side, then he's got a potential in this match. I think he's got enough top-end strength on that left arm to separate Vitalii and open him out a little. And that's probably what you saw in your match, in your mind. I don't know. But I do think... I really do not know the strength level.
Engin Terzi: rank level I just can't but technically I see Tobias having good chance but you know it doesn't matter Tobias is better in my opinion left arm left arm Tobias is the better left-hander um is much stronger than then I mean it doesn't matter how technical like like and stylistically I see that obvious uh in better
Engin Terzi: position but i really don't know um guys uh by the way uh 85 percent of the those those trading cards have been sold so because i i repeat this because last time after the event i'm not extremely minimum hundred people asked me if i have anything left so i just say now because we are how many like a little bit more than three weeks away
Engin Terzi: 23 days away so don't be late because you will not find more than what it is there's also signed t-shirts and there are also signed posters this is from east versus west uh five and this one next one will be the same you know atlas will sign okay let's go to the next one pauline versus sasho andrew oh i mean first question first question
Neil Pickup: If you were Pauline, where would you attack? I have my own answer, but I want to ask you. My personal opinion would be that I wouldn't go out. Like I said to Rob earlier on, I wouldn't be looking to go too far out. Yeah. I think he needs to remain balanced. If he tries to go too outside with his guys... That's suicide to try to topple the guy. Yes, that's the answer to that question. I think there's a halfway house here where...
Neil Pickup: If I was Paul, using the explosivity that he's got, which is definitely higher than that of his opponent, hitting for position is key. I wouldn't try and make this about power. I'd make it about hitting for position, and then with your second attack, I would go for the kill of that. I see Paul as an underdog. I think he's pulling, in my opinion, this guy comes in on his best day,
Neil Pickup: sasho is arguably the best guy in the world of that weight class on any given day he is a very very hard man to overcome the guy is extraordinarily unorthodox he's also got quite weird timing he doesn't arm wrestle in an orthodox manner either positionally or
Neil Pickup: From a timing perspective, he's hard to time. He's hard to... You can't time this guy's breathing and attack in a normal way. It's very difficult to overcome an opponent like that. Hence, we've seen him create problems for truly exceptional arm wrestlers. How many times have we seen Evgeny Prudnik, who is, as good as it gets technically, fall victim to this guy? So, this is...
Neil Pickup: match that paul can win but a match that he is going into as an underdog in my opinion i have no doubt in my mind that the guy that we see out there will be the best version of paul we've ever seen yes and i think he is motivated to an extraordinary level for this match listening to paul talk when he's been on the fix and you don't meet many guys that are straight to them paul the guy's arrow
Neil Pickup: He's coming into this thing feeling like this is the opportunity. This is the coming out party. This is the one where nobody can say anything against it because of the fact that he's pulling a guy who, as far as we know, is coming in 100% fit. He's an absolutely lethal force at the weight class. So if Paul can sweep it, very much like we said about Doug Erlich, that it's undeniable.
Engin Terzi: And I wish Paul the very best to look in that endeavor. There's no, if you were going to throw a man into that situation, who better than Paul then? You know what I mean? The guy is up for it, mate. Yeah. There is one guy who's asking how is obvious he's better left-hander while Vitalii has won Wafs, Zloty. My friend, we didn't say, when you win an armwrestling match, you don't have to be technically the best.
Engin Terzi: You can be strong, and we are not saying Vitalii is not good technically. Vitalii is a technical master. We are just saying when we compare these two guys stylistically, then we think that the other one's style in such matchup looks better. But the last word is said by the power, my friend. You can be a technical master. Someone who doesn't even know arm wrestling, he can just hold you and crush it.
Engin Terzi: It doesn't make him a better armwrestler in a technical way. I think the thing that we expressed and what you understood, not the same thing, you know. Neil pickups three inches chest rep. Engin, can you tell what countries are buying the most pay-per-views or most merchandise? My friend, about the pay-per-view, I don't do that. It is core sports.
Engin Terzi: I only know the final numbers for sure. And the most merchandise, we need to check it because I don't send them. We have someone who is sending them from the website. I need to really go and check from which country how many are sold. Thank you for your support. Yeah, and let's go.
Engin Terzi: Let's go to another one. Who's next up, mate? Irakli. Before that one, let's go Dave Chaffee versus Revaz. Ooh. I'm going to go with Dave Chaffee. Because of his incredible side pressure. Yeah, pretty much. And the unorthodox style and the fact that he's... Yeah, I'm going with Dave. The fact that he's evolving a little.
Neil Pickup: That said, this is a great win if Dave can pull it off. Because whilst Rivas might not be the biggest name in the super heavyweight division, he's very much a dark horse. He's very, very, very strong. Very, very difficult to beat. Extraordinarily committed. It'll take everything Dave's got to win. If there's a big chance for Rivas, for me, it's on endurance. I think Dave is still susceptible there.
Neil Pickup: I think he can gas out. And I think that Rivas is big enough to meet him head on in a lot of areas. And we'll try to outlast him. This is a much closer match than my optimism for Dave perhaps suggests. I think it's very close to 50-50. Yeah. People who have seen Rivas recently, they are amazed about
Engin Terzi: the shape that Revaz's in right now. He's changed a great deal, has he? Yeah, they said he's in incredible shape. They say he's in incredible shape, yeah. But from other side, we know that Dave Chaffee had pulled non-stop and he never really recovered. You know, last year he pulled again, again, again, again. Of course, Revaz's also pulled three events.
Engin Terzi: But I think that Dave Sheffy now is fully recovered. He will come there very fresh. And same for Rewas because his last event was the same event that Dave Sheffy pulled because he missed the January event. So I am expecting, how do you call that, Clash of Titans? Yeah, I think this is one of the better matches on the card, Engin.
Neil Pickup: my opinion in terms of matching styles and levels i think you've done a great job with this one um i think it's one of the matches that's probably been overlooked by a lot of people and yet in true east versus west fashion it's a friggin slayer of a match my friend my friends uh if it was up to me i can set 25 matches most likely i cannot cover the event
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I know you would as well. In fact, I'm going to say it was up to you. You'd set 50 matches and go bankrupt. That's probably what you'd do. There may be times that I will lose some money and still earn something because yeah, because I mean, by the way, like it looks like 11, five match less than last event, but this is more expensive because every event, Atlas, you know, also slowly gets
Engin Terzi: more and more you know this is how it should be okay then let's go to iraq this is rakash really right let me just say let's not be silly what am i changing what do you think what do you think i'm going to tell you something most of the people think that ongar ongar is like the favorites my opinion on that way
Engin Terzi: has more control while iraqi has more horse power i agree with that statement and and john is thinking it's a very close match but he gives the edge slightly to it i'll agree with that how do you see this one i see the versatility of kira galley being his biggest weapon i see explosivity
Neil Pickup: of Irakli being his biggest weapon. I know that everybody was very impressed, including myself, with Irakli's last performance against John, with his dogged determination to gut that thing out. But that was down to the youthful enthusiasm of the younger man and the ability
SPEAKER_04: Is that mine or his? Hmm.
SPEAKER_04: No, it was okay already for me, but I think it continues showing that until I start talking. Yeah, anyway, so until Neil comes back,
Engin Terzi: shortly we can continue okay so yes i blackmail as well you know yeah yes yes i'm back here i have been here anyways any questions for engine anyways
Neil Pickup: yeah oh neil is back
Neil Pickup: Sorry, one minute I was here, then all of a sudden I travelled back in time, we spilled two episodes of Arm Wars and fixed about half the matches. Looks like you're freezing again. Oh, I don't know what's going on. Just for the last 10 minutes, use your own internet. Must be knackered. Let me try and turn something. I mean, East versus West.
Engin Terzi: you can you hear me yeah yeah i hear you but you you look um frozen yeah your hands in the air like this yeah yeah you want matushenko i i think i think i already set the match for you you want matushenko next event but yeah so i don't know what's wrong with your
Engin Terzi: I can hear you clearly. I just can't see you. You cannot see me? No. Well, now I see you. Now I see you. Okay, so we see each other. Okay, let's go with Irakli and Ongarbaev. Okay, I was just going off on one just before I flipped out there. I don't know what happened. I think that Ongarbaev, his biggest weapon is the versatility.
Neil Pickup: The technical dynamism is his biggest weapon. I think that the opportunity for Irakli to cut it out and outlast him, I don't see that being an option. I think Zirakashvili's biggest weapon here is explosivity and trying to finish the thing early. For me, the longer the match goes, the more it favours Kirigali. That's my honest opinion.
Neil Pickup: would say that uh can i just say great comment there from uh adam adam repper where he's put neil is stealing his neighbor's wi-fi understand cheers buddy i love it absolute class some of the comments are awesome mate so the uh the the match balance for me
Neil Pickup: I think it's in favour of Kirigali. I think Kirigali's a slight favourite. I... I think there is a huge threat off the starts for Miracle. I think he's strong enough and explosive enough to finish the thing. But I think he needs to. I think if it stops and turns into any kind of dogfight, I go with Kirigali. What are you thinking, Terzi? What are you thinking? I...
Engin Terzi: I think that like John also talked that like he's more, I'll say, with more horsepower. You remember he brought John, like he stretched him like till here, the round one, you know? Yeah. And then from there, John, like, yeah, I think that John, John said that, you know, he needs to just be aggressive and put him out of position and win. And John is thinking that the longer he will be,
Engin Terzi: better it will be for a kidder galley so i also think that iraq has more horsepower generally especially fresh or fresh but it really has more control and ability so we will say you know like i think iraq needs to dominate either guy i do i think he needs to pull humanity he needs to finish
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he needs to do that. He needs to put the match away. If the match turns into a long, drawn-out technical battle, I think Curtis Galli is a very hard man to beat in that kind of scenario. And you have $1,000 somebody gave you only for betting. Where would I put it? Curtis Galli. Curtis Galli. And let's go to the most important match for the community.
Neil Pickup: Okay. So I think a lot of people will be really divided on this. I think that you've got, you know, this is the classic East versus West, isn't it? This is the guy where you've got the ultra popular arm wrestler. You either love him or you hate him, but ultra popular in the main Devon Lara, incredibly technical, well-rounded. We know that his level is right there and we know that he's evolving. Nobody works harder.
Neil Pickup: He is clearly being matched in that respect by Genadi. You only have to look at Genadi's body shape, his size, what he's doing, to understand that the man is working extremely hard. And I think we're going to see that from everybody who faces Devon going forward. You're going to see the very best of them.
Neil Pickup: What's interesting to me is... Biggest opportunity of their lives. Biggest. And particularly for someone as proud and as thoughtful, diligent. A lot of people see this guy as naturally aggressive. They see Genadi because of how he conducts himself in certain situations. They think he's this naturally aggressive guy. Not really. He's got an aggression about him, sure.
Neil Pickup: I think that he needs to make sure, he needs to make sure that he is appreciative of the level of danger that Devon presents throughout the match from round one to the final whistle. Because one thing we can absolutely guarantee is that Devon will fight for every millimeter up there.
Neil Pickup: And it will start the moment his foot touches the floor in Istanbul. I think Devon right now, from what I have seen, is going to be a very, very hard man to beat. Because it comes back to what we were saying earlier on. How quickly you can finish an athlete is critically important. Genadi's got incredible versatility, but is he strong enough to finish Devon quick?
Engin Terzi: How many, let's light up the chat now. How many people in there believe that Genadi Kvikvinia can finish Devon quick? How many of you think? If you think it can, yes. There is no one in any poll on social media can win against Devon, including Levan that we saw that he was underdog against Devon. So I am sure that even people who knows our mistakes, they will think as you do.
Neil Pickup: But you are not going to get a result that is going to be against Devon's favour. Well, the other thing is that I think that Genadi Kvikvinia will also believe that, and will take a lot of confidence from the fact that he's faced Kings movers before, but let's make no mistake about it.
Engin Terzi: the Kings move that he will see from Devon is extremely different in style and execution to what he faced with Michael but yeah yeah yeah he dominated Michael's hand I don't think they will be the case against Devon no but I will also remind the same thing that I also asked to John and then
Engin Terzi: when the only possibility that i see you remember round one when john and devon pulled in dubai and then he came very close to the impact yeah and devon personally told me that he felt that there was like one or two seconds that john could finish him if he did the transition to do that with shoulder pressure yeah so what i'm just saying uh
Engin Terzi: That threat is there. Devon is now, I believe, much stronger than Devon. And, but... Genadi is stronger than John. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Much stronger than Devon as well. No disrespect. John is now incredible, but I can say limited to 100, 500, 15 kilos. Not the elite superhero with no disrespect. But... Genadi, what Devon suggested...
Engin Terzi: Genadi is one of the best at it you know that when when somebody is that you remember when when Ferit was trying to do the same thing and then he was just he didn't forward but it's that move it's not like at the level of Devon most likely that move but what we will see will be a Genadi that we have never seen before this is what he also said and i think we're seeing it now
Engin Terzi: this is this is the biggest biggest opportunity and whenever we say that you know we will see the best canada many of the devon's fans will say oh anyone's they want to lose or something they have no idea i and devon are very close with almost like a few days we sit on uh you know video chat and everything you know um but
Engin Terzi: This is a respect for Devon that Genadi is coming there with a shape that he has never been. That means that you know how important he sees this match and how much credit he gives to his opponent, how dangerous. Otherwise, he would come in a shape that he has been coming. This is what he is saying and this is what we are guessing as well. So I am not expecting an easy match for Devon.
Neil Pickup: Devon. No, I'm not either. I don't think Devon is. Devon is. We originally set this match up in the WAL pre-pandemic. It was the Jerry Cab match. And at that time we believed that it was a nailed on war. And speaking to Devon at that time, he has massive respect for and was very appreciative of the versatile threat
Neil Pickup: that Genadi Kvikvinia represents. The way I see the match, I think it does turn into a dogfight at some point. And I think in that scenario, Devon is the favourite. Again, I'd give Devon 55% to 45%, maybe 60-40% over the duration. I believe it turns into a dogfight. And I believe that in that scenario, Devon is going to be very, very tough to beat.
Engin Terzi: That's what I believe. So I'm going Devon. I think that it will not be an easy win. No, no. Yeah. But Genadi somehow believes in his endurance as well. He also asked me, when did you see me when I'm in an evenly match? And that's doubt, he says. So he claims that his endurance is as good as
Engin Terzi: devins but he believes that he's also stronger more horsepower than devon so we will see there is a super set and wuk1 my main concern with devon is is the jump back up to super heavy too quick and again will the dennis match still be on if devon loses yes my friend yes the match is set and and i don't think that he just jumped
Engin Terzi: back to super heavyweight too quick my friend even he made 253 he was like he came from 265 and then even the next day for the match he was again 265 right now all he did is just gonna put 15 pounds on and he doesn't really need to do uh six months of preparation you know i don't think that like like that one is like he proved that he's too much for heavyweights
Engin Terzi: He proved he is too much for heavyweight. And I don't think that those heavyweight guys are like miles behind the super heavyweights. They are. If you talk about some like Levan and this and that. But I'm just saying that Devon is too much for heavyweight. And he was already in between heavyweight and super heavyweight. So all he needs to do is put some weight on and gain 10% if possible.
Engin Terzi: and then he's right there you know i don't think that he will have guys he the guy knows what he's doing uh for sure and for sure he knows it um if devil knows what he's doing trust me not many people knows the guy knows himself thank you for your super chat and yeah whenever i talk in the favor of
Neil Pickup: devon then i hope people will not think that i hate these guys this time i need to make sure this nobody will find opportunity you know this is this is in some respects um one of the most exciting matches you could possibly put devon in yeah and why is just because the character of ganadi kutvinya i love the character of the guy at the table if we see a situation emerge where
Neil Pickup: It's a battle of wills and spirits up there. I think Genadi Kvikvinia is going to just try and meet it head on. And those people who are familiar with Kvikvinia, his career throughout, will know that some of his most entertaining, best moments, when we've really seen him rise to the occasion, is when he's been in the degree of adversity in a match, gets the blood up and goes crazy.
Neil Pickup: That's led to some super impressive performances. And I think that we might, I think this is a fitting main event. And I think this is good. The place is going to ignite off the back of this. I really do. I think it's going to be ridiculous. Yeah. But again, last time was 16 matches. When it came to Jerry Cadoret versus Georgii Svetko match, like,
Engin Terzi: All adrenaline was gone because the event was so exciting. Then when this match happened, if you would put that match as like middle of somewhere in the event, you would get crazy. But we were just looking like this to that match, even though how exciting it was.
Engin Terzi: so i think that this is good that you know we do 11 matches so that we will have some something uh i agree i think that i think everybody will be supercharged mate i think it'll it'll still be revved um i think there'll be a lot of arm wrestlers out there obviously more than usual because we got the qualifier let's take it yeah yeah you know that right same morning there will be quite a bit yeah how many coming from england i think about six something like that total of six yeah
Engin Terzi: Okay. And another thing that I want to say, did you see that the nickname or the energy of what is his nickname? No, no, they don't. They, they, they, they made a nickname. Genadi. We clean. Yeah. Quick winner. Yeah. Yeah. This quick winner. Love it. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: anyway so let's let's uh finish it and another thing last ask what do you think about morozov and his improvements you know yeah guys going through the roof do you take him seriously oh yeah yeah people doesn't take him seriously but the guy is like i don't know if it is the time july 29th
Neil Pickup: that time or this time this guy this guy is coming there i ask him i mean what do they mean they don't take him seriously i mean how can anybody you you take him seriously if you have to peel him off your wife tell you what that is a big strong but i mean physically imposing individual that and he's young and he's progressing and he can really pull i mean my god what's not to be taken seriously everything about that guy is a threat
Engin Terzi: I think he's going to evolve more as time goes on, you know. I mean, his performance against Dave. What's today? What's today? April what? Middle of April. The guy has three and a half months. He has three and a half months. And what's his weight now? Under 40. He plans to be 145. And this guy doesn't look fat at all. I saw some pictures of him.
Neil Pickup: The other day, could have been on Concrete Elbow or one of those channels. Check out Concrete Elbow if you've not already. And he looked immoral. I mean, he was stood, I think he was just chilling out. He'd gone watching one of his friends compete in something, maybe a bodybuilding show or something like that it was. And wow, he looked colossal, conditioned.
Neil Pickup: Um, yeah. Exciting prospect. I take him very seriously. I've said for a while, do you give him any, any possibility, any possibly at all against the one? No. Yeah. Of course he's got a shot. He's got a shot. Anything can happen. Uh, I've got obviously LeBron's a favorite. I think LeBron takes, yeah. LeBron's the favorite, you know, and I think LeBron is going to come there better than
Engin Terzi: was against hermes because the guy was just so relaxed he was not feeling threatened now the guy is just you know somebody really needs to push your limits so that you feel like you know okay i need to improve more it's a strange scenario isn't it we always you know everybody put praise for the downfall of the guy at the top everybody prays for that guy to lose and so i think lavon's great
Neil Pickup: I love the dude. I think he's fantastic. He's a really, really lovely guy. He's giant. He can really pull. That match with Hermes was bloody incredibly entertaining. I hope that Levan comes in good shape, mentally and physically. I hope the pressure isn't starting to annoy him. And I hope also...
Neil Pickup: motivation's still there because it's always easier to be the hunter than the hunted you know i i always think that that's a scenario that people perhaps don't consider i mean when the man said that he doesn't want to lose a pin and he doesn't want to lose this he doesn't want to lose that back in the day people mocked him for it that's an incredible um thing to put out there just because if you were dominant keeping the motivation if you're a dominant champion is one of the biggest challenges
Neil Pickup: Yeah. Gets you to the gym. Now the wolf's tooth has the blood. They saw that the king is possible to bleed. Oh, yeah. Will that give people thought? Will that give people thoughts that he did it? I can do it. Yes, it will.
Neil Pickup: Yeah, I think perhaps the more important question is, does it expose any mental frailty in Levan himself? Deep down in the quiet moments, does he question himself? Does he think, oh, there's something I need to address there? If he does, he's more motivated. He says he's more motivated because he really needed to be shaken.
Engin Terzi: Good on him. Yeah. And as your record says, Morozov is 100% worth it. And the very last question, Alexey Vorvadov's return against John Burzink. Yeah. What do you think that this guy is returning? And you are the one who announced all those matches in the legendary 2004 Zloty Tour. Yeah. And I was the one who started the idea of Dream Team.
Engin Terzi: on North East message board. Correct. And then we gather the team. And then even at that time, it was the East versus West. What do you mean? Because they never did to go to Zloty. And on the North East message board, how about sending a dream team? How about making? And then I remember Matt Garner, Travis Pageant, Rambert, John Burzink, and Christopher Myers, Mike Salaris, Chad Silvers. I remember, you know,
Engin Terzi: i don't i don't know if i'm missing anyone but did you get told zilla he was there as well with me that year uh 2005 he wins okay yeah yeah yeah the match between uh john and alexa i actually refereed that you know oh you were the referee yeah oh okay so you were the one and now 19 years later exactly 19 years later these guys i mean for me
Engin Terzi: This is not to find out the best guy in the world, but from the historical perspective, this is one of the most important matches in the history. And Alexei Voevoda is coming and John Burzink
Engin Terzi: he's not at his super best form but the guy if he's rested if he's healed up if he's not ill covered or something you know people doesn't know that he had covered i'm not going to say when that's why the breathing problem is bad with him but this guy is still very dangerous oh yeah how do you do this match i actually think john's the favorite
Neil Pickup: Wow. Even though Alexei is a much younger man and an absolute athlete, I think the level of activity that John has had is massively in his favour. I'm talking real match experience. Again, the environment, the familiarity with the environment, I think is in favour of John.
Neil Pickup: Obviously, you would have to think that athleticism at this time, probably natural strength, would go with Alexis, a much bigger man. And younger. And much younger. I do believe that from an arm wrestling perspective, John is the better arm wrestler. Doesn't matter who you put him against. My other question is,
Neil Pickup: the level of motivation from both men. And I think John is probably more embedded within the game right now, and it's more a part of him. Alexi has always loved the sport of arm wrestling quite clearly, but he's a man with so many talents, such athleticism, such a diverse field of opportunity.
Neil Pickup: I mean, where do you believe his motivation's at for this thing? Do you believe we're going to see, is this just a one-off and done? Or are we going to see him throw himself back into that? I mean, what is he, like 41, 42 years old? Something like that?
Neil Pickup: I think a little bit more. I think he was 24 around that time, like 2004. If I was a guessing man, I would say he's like 41, 42, but don't quote me. Yeah, maybe 43, yeah. But way younger, an absolute athlete.
Neil Pickup: in every sense of the word. I mean, when that guy was weighing like... Also very good armwrestler. Very good armwrestler. Hand control and everything, yeah. Great armwrestler. Very, very... He's also a highly intelligent lad. He really considers everything. His approach to the sport, to any athletic discipline, is really diligent. He's a very proud guy. He's very experienced.
Engin Terzi: And I do think that if he comes in and commits to the sport again, I think he can really do something again. I think he's an exceptional individual. Neil, just remember, this guy returned lost against Tim Bresnan. You can be sure that this guy will do his best to...
Engin Terzi: same thing to not to happen again have you had any private conversations with him yet i mean of course that's how we made the agreement but i don't really deeply go there i don't know because we talked through translation yeah i don't really go there i don't want to like so much involved like do you do you feel like he could be here for
Engin Terzi: foreseeable future or do you feel like he's coming to yes yes the guy is coming to to make a comeback but he wants to he wants to do step by step he doesn't want to there is a there is a good suggestion people says that how about 19 years later again neil pick up reps that match ah i'll be wearing it look i'll be wearing a few caps that night okay
Engin Terzi: I'll be wearing a few caps. The announcer, the commentator, the referee. How about, I said the match, you break the world record. You start with the supermatch yourself. Yeah, yeah. You do the first match.
Engin Terzi: arm wrestling after first match you continue to announcement and then then then you continue yeah announcement and the uh commentating and then when the last match comes you're like referee yeah
Neil Pickup: no i i i would love i would love to watch the thing i would love to be up in the the commentary uh the commentary booth maybe myself and trav and we'll we'll we'll run through it and yeah i think that will be awesome okay let's finish it is
Engin Terzi: Like if I continue, I can open stuff just to make it for hours. But my missus will divorce me. I'm like an hour and five minutes late now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is what people were saying that they said that she unplugged the WiFi. She probably did. She may well have done that. I'll go. But she knows back a little bit. Yeah. Look at that. You see, not bad for an older guy.
Neil Pickup: I went in the gym the other day, Engin. I started last week and I took them in the gym. They did some bench pressing. And like an idiot, I did some short-range speed benching for cardio. Oh, my God.
Engin Terzi: oh my god let me tell you my my tits are killing healing you need to start from somewhere my friend it's gonna happen like that yeah but listen listen first one month like just one month be patient one month after one month you will like it there is one more super hit bionic dan flexman never bet against the goals hey there you go yeah anyway so thanks to everyone
