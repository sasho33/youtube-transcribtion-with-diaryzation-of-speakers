Unknown: Can you hear us? I can't hear you. One second. You're on mute. You're on mute. Ah, we see. Yeah, sorry. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: are we okay we see okay the the image yeah yeah we are live right now we are live right now yeah hundreds of thousands on youtube soon douglas will come or now he will show like one
Engin Terzi: window at the time but when when darkness comes yeah we will we will be all on the same screen yeah so how is everything how are you daniel good yeah very good yeah you just competed romanian nations
Daniel Procopciuc: yeah yeah yes yes how did you do uh better left than right but uh i got second uh right and uh seventh uh uh second left and um which category yeah yeah yeah okay i have um the uh golfer's elbow you know
Engin Terzi: On my right, you know, I can't get rid of it. I know you also had it. Not had it, have it, everything. I can count you, I can count you 10 different serious injuries. Even now hurting, all of them. Yeah. And Daniel, Daniel just competed the Moldova event, was it like last week? Yeah, yeah. And you won, right, left?
Daniel Procopciuc: yeah 75 and the overall i didn't left right then he didn't compete right at open only left at open and uh one category yeah he saved his right arm for douglas yeah yeah yeah and daniel what's your weight now uh 78 78
Engin Terzi: that's normal weight like yeah i think do you think you will be maybe 81 or something no no it's okay it's okay yeah yeah yeah let's let us wait douglas before i steal the pot so you are now
Engin Terzi: like graduated, you did everything, you are fully doctor right now, right? You are Dr. Daniel Prokop. Yeah. And yours is orthopedic, correct? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow, like what a lucky people that are new arm masters. You know, guys, yeah, he's a world-level arm master and also doctor, orthopedist, you know, just like, wow.
Daniel Procopciuc: Yeah, he breaks the arms and then fixes them up, you know, so. Oh, okay. He's making his own customers. Yeah, preparing. So any injury in this match, you know, he can fix it, you know, so no problem. Oh, did you hear that, Douglas? What did he say? Daniel Prokopchuk is a doctor. He's an orthopedist.
Engin Terzi: and an orthopedic surgeon. Yeah. His surgeon and his translator is also an arm master. Um, he said that, you know, he usually fixes the injuries that he himself causes. So he said that in this event, if you get hurt, you know, he's going to help you through this is, uh, this is, you know, you know,
Doug Erlich: he said he's not gonna charge anything like this hey i get free medical service that's good oh i i thought i thought you would say that you would need it oh i'm definitely not going to need it if he can perform surgery on himself that might be helpful the reason the reason that daniel is laughing because
Daniel Procopciuc: like he liked it or he finds it too funny that Douglas may hurt me. He said it's funny because that's out of the realm of possibilities, you know, so just
Engin Terzi: So, okay, so basically he's saying that Douglas is dreaming. This is what he's saying, basically. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay, I understand. Let's see, let's see, Douglas, what's your weight, Douglas, as of now? He said that he's 78, 79 kilos, and he says, he just said that before you come, he doesn't need to gain weight to beat you. I'm about 81, 82. He better put on some size, I'm going to tell you that right now. He's a little too small.
Engin Terzi: okay the better he said that he you you did you hear what what doctor said yeah yeah he he understood you know okay okay okay i understand so that was what what are you gonna do with this guy you're gonna topple him and beat him look he look he's supposed to win he's got all the accolades he's the guy he's considered the best in the world at his weight you know he's young
Daniel Procopciuc: this old man's gonna come in there and just impose his will. I plan on, I just can't picture him beating me. I feel like he's too small. Daniel wants to know
Daniel Procopciuc: um to make things interesting you know to make a good batch uh what style uh he wants daniel to pull him you know like toe pole hook you know well i know i know where he's gonna i know where he's gonna end up in that little king's movie does because that's what he's gonna have to resort to king's move that's what he's gonna have to do no no he said his move you know he said that you know
Daniel Procopciuc: in any case he said that daniel is going to end up losing his wrist so he doesn't have more choices is this what he's saying correct oh yeah so daniel says definitely not losing his wrist only i mean as a gift you know like if he wants but uh that will definitely not happen
Engin Terzi: screen record screen record that thing and screen record that because he said he will be on youtube he will be on youtube so he is saying that he's not going to lose his wrist only only if he would give you as a gift that's what he's saying yeah exactly yeah yeah i understand yeah oh so he's already building an excuse for if he loses his wrist he gave it to me okay i get it
Daniel Procopciuc: so he said then he will not give it if if the gift is not well received you know you will not give his peace and any and any yeah if you want to know all the matches can can go to hook so um
Engin Terzi: uh tiberius sometimes your voice get cut sometimes you know i hear and sometimes don't hear but what i understand he is saying that he would give his wrist only as a gift but he says that you know looks like that this doesn't appreciate so because of this he's not gonna give his wrist anymore exactly and then yeah yeah and then and then he's he says that he's gonna beat him uh in different way okay i understand yeah and douglas
Doug Erlich: What is this guy trying to do? He's trying to. Okay. Look, he's. I think I think he's already a little bit overconfident, which he should be. He's the favorite. He's 100% favorite, right? That's what the polls are showing. You know, I think he's like 7525, but you know he's. He's got all the accolades. Everybody thinks he's going to win and.
Doug Erlich: Just like last time, everybody thought my last opponent was going to win. So, you know, we'll see on the table. His hand is like this big. He's going to need the straps. I know he's going to the straps because he's definitely, definitely losing his hand outside the straps. He will run to the straps just like he does in every match I see on YouTube. He runs straight to the straps because his hand is so small. It's like a baby's hand. He's going to win.
Daniel Procopciuc: Definitely, that's good. I see it. It's like this big. Not that small. I'm like five. I'm like six-six, you know? So not that small, you know? Ask him if he's going to run to the straps like he always does.
Daniel Procopciuc: Yeah, all the matches in strap, like real men. Just hold on. Just hold on. Hey, listen, going to the straps don't make you more of a man. You just hold on. Why run? Running makes you less of a man. Hey, if you go hook,
Daniel Procopciuc: Like, no problem, you know, you can do it without strap, you know. But if you run, you know, why hold on if you run? I'll go inside when I'm up 2-0. What's the winning hook when 2-0? 2-0 for me. Good luck.
Doug Erlich: But, Douglas, whenever you say that, like, hold on and this and this, from outside look, it looks like you don't like your chances in strap. Oh, no. I love the straps. I love the straps. But I'm going to make him have to get there, though. He's going to have to. I'm going to make him have to run for the straps. I'm not just going to give them to him. Okay. I understand. And...
Daniel Procopciuc: was that Daniel says if he likes crap we can do we can do all the matches in scrap no problem no no no he says he said that he would go there only if Daniel earns it he said that he needs to gain this he's not going to be given to him you know that's what he says Daniel says uh it will not be
Engin Terzi: uh hard to go into straps it will be very easy you'll need them yeah corey corey maker thank you for your super shed you are a savage douglas put in the florida and handle on the map you got this brother yeah
Daniel Procopciuc: Can you ask Daniel, seriously, without teasing and trying to intimidate each other, what does he expect from this match? How does he see this match? Realistically, how do you see the match going? I think it's okay. Forza has good physical strength.
Daniel Procopciuc: He said he likes the matchup, that his opponent is strong enough, you know, so it's not a matter of strength, but a matter of styles. So once he gets the hook, the match will be over. But can he think that he can hook like this? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Daniel Procopciuc: You can hook, yeah. Can you ask him, can he also top roll, Douglas, according to him? Yeah, he can hook, he can top roll, you know. Just he is not prepared of the style that Daniel has. It's not just the strength difference, you know.
Engin Terzi: He says the strength is pretty much balanced, you know, but just his style, you know, you'll not be able to match it. So he's saying that the strength is close or because of the technique? He said that Daniel says that he's much stronger or because of his technique he has the advantage? I didn't understand. Because of the technique, you know. Because of the technique. Yeah, yeah. Okay, he says that his opening is also very strong.
Doug Erlich: but because of the technique technique he can apply what he has i understand and darkness what do you expect from this match i mean like i said before the truth is like he's supposed to win right uh he's the he's the favorite he's current in my opinion best in the world um
Doug Erlich: But I see a lot of his videos. I see a lot of the lanes. He explains how he arm wrestles a lot in his training videos. So he's got good data out there for me to research right out the gate. I see him run a lot to the back of the pad, like he did with Dave and elbow fouled twice in two matches. It was against the hoop goalie.
Doug Erlich: Oh, yeah. I mean, I'm not afraid to go inside with him at all. I didn't go inside with Ray because I knew it was my easiest path to victory. And my endurance was in question at the time because I hadn't been training long. So my hook is actually probably my best lane, if you want to know the truth. It's just, I'm going to go with my easiest path to victory first. That's my plan, which every way I think is...
Doug Erlich: fastest way to get the first pin i don't you know there's why why go into a grinder if you don't have to in your mind are you clear about winning this match i'm not losing daniel's another guy that's on the other side of the table with me like i treat i'm going to treat him the same way i treat any other opponent there's zero intimidation
Doug Erlich: I'm going to step up and I want him to have this same smile on his face when I scream in his face. You know those matches where he just stares at those opponents. Look, I'm not Corey Miller, buddy. I'm not Corey Miller where he's going to go right into your power and just get stonewalled. I'm stronger than Corey. I'm stronger than you.
Daniel Procopciuc: daniel said corey miller also thought this so it was a very different uh situation at the table yeah well corey's not as strong as me and he doesn't go in the same lane as me either he went straight sideways right into you yes
Doug Erlich: You know, I'm physically bigger than him, but our weight's going to be very close. You know, a lot of people are going to have the illusion that I'm just a much bigger guy than him because I have a bigger frame. You know, I just have very low body fat. I'm really, how tall is, how tall is Daniel? 5'5"?
Daniel Procopciuc: I don't know in inches. What's the centimeter? Centimeter 170. About 5'7. So about 5'6 then. Yeah, a lot of people like to make themselves taller than they are. Yeah, I think the only thing that matters is how much you have on the arm and forearm. So it doesn't matter like...
Daniel Procopciuc: uh how tall you are or how big you are you know how much you have on the arm oh it matters we all know sasha you know like yeah yeah i'm six one for the people in the uh in the uh chat that are asking how tall i am i'm six one and and okay basically we understand that
Engin Terzi: daniel is so comfortable about his winning he is even just so relaxed and saying that he can beat him this way he can beat him if he wants up roll and while douglas is saying that the things will not be as daniel is thinking and but daniel uh sorry douglas compared to your last match do you expect something
Doug Erlich: uh stronger oh yeah i mean he would have beat ray the same way i'd be ready i mean no disrespect to ray but i mean it wouldn't have been you know it's kind of hard to get a gauge off of that match when i'm probably 15 20 stronger now than i was then um and not to mention um daniel was definitely another level
Doug Erlich: um than my last opponent so i'm not i'm not oblivious to that but i'm gonna treat him the same way i would treat anybody across the table from me daniel asked douglas how can he know
Daniel Procopciuc: uh he grew 20 you know he because he doesn't uh know uh how he um uh how he gets uh stronger like and uh he also said you know he only gets like a couple of percentage you know like two two three percent you know in strength you know how how could he
Doug Erlich: uh gain such massive strength you know like how do you think daniel how do you think i will tell you this my gym numbers are way up my table output's way up so uh you can uh come to your own conclusions i think i think the the only way that's possible is that if the person haven't competed for many years
Engin Terzi: and if coming back from down if that then it can be possible but yeah if you are if you are already in top shape all the time as you said one percent two percent three percent maximum but if you if you are 100 but if you just stop pulling if you're coming from 50 60 then it's possible to come back 15 20 percent yeah
Doug Erlich: But I don't know the case, but this is what I'm guessing. I would agree with that. Like, I was training for six weeks prior to Ray. So if you include those six weeks, I'll have four months or so for Daniel. Mm-hmm.
Doug Erlich: And that's what i'm saying Daniel you do this for a like a living basically you train year round, I see your videos you can't let this old man come in there and beat you you're gonna let an old man walk in there and beat you when you're in your prime 27 year old prime. Daniel says he respects his elders you know so he might he might give you.
Daniel Procopciuc: uh a match you know if uh if uh you are very weak you know what your voice gets cut sometimes i don't know if it's happening only to me but say again can you repeat so daniel says if he's uh too weak you know he respects his elders you know he respects his elders and uh he might give uh he might give doug
Doug Erlich: Okay, okay, I understand. So what he's saying is that if he feels that Douglas is so weak, he will look like it's a tough match, what he's saying. That's very kind of you, man. That's very humble. You know, that humble topic was a very important topic in my last match. And, you know, I appreciate that, you know.
Doug Erlich: making it look good put on an act just don't act too much because i might i might i might dive in there and get a win um do you get intimidated when he is just so comfortably talking like this what kind of effect it creates in you i think it's a little bit fake i think he's a little nervous honestly
Doug Erlich: I mean, like I said, letting this nobody come in here, like I've got nothing to lose. I've got nothing to lose. I can talk all this shit right now. I lose. I was expected to lose. He can't afford to lose to me. Not with his name, not with what he's done. He can't afford to lose to me. It's going to crush him. He'll go from here to here.
Doug Erlich: so basically i'm going to retire you from east first west if i win daniel says he accepts any loss and he will he will just come back stronger you know no no shame in losing oh where was the confidence though there's no there's no chance you lose right there's no chance now we're changing up seeing and i told you there's some nerves in there there's some nerves
Engin Terzi: yeah it was very it was kind of like if he loses he will come back stronger it it just sounded like daniel is not that confident if he can even mention such such thing
Daniel Procopciuc: Daniel says he's 100% confident that he will win. He was saying about losses in general, like the match with Samushia.
Doug Erlich: so um not talking about uh necessarily about like the the match with uh with doug you know but you know ask him his percentages and what what do you what are the percentages the percentages in our match what do you think what do you think it is daniel you're a hundred percent favorite
Daniel Procopciuc: uh he says 99.99 you know because one percent you know maybe the the airplane will have a problem or something you know so you never know but if he gets to the table healthy you know it will be 100
Engin Terzi: 99.9 i want to ask the chat like am i the only one who is sometimes having a hard time to hear what tiberio says about the sound sometimes we don't hear you yeah sometimes we don't hear you i don't know why something is touching to the microphone or i don't know let me
Engin Terzi: Can you hear us better? I mean, now, yes, but sometimes I also hear fine. But sometimes it's just we don't hear you for some time. Yeah. Anyway, so he said that he's going to beat you 99.99%. And why is that? Why not? How did you say? I didn't understand that part. Maybe the plane will have a little problem, you know. Say again. Going, yeah.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah so as long as he shows up it's a hundred percent chance i got it exactly and and you will be you will be this confident or you will be uh different with your prediction me
Doug Erlich: Oh, Daniel's 100%. Daniel's 100% chance that he's going to win this. I mean, I'm just going to show up and he's going to beat me and I'm going to tuck my tail between my legs and I'm going to run home. That's what's going to happen, right, Daniel? Yeah, yeah, pretty accurate.
Doug Erlich: All right, I got a .01% chance of winning. That's what I'll put. And if that is only if something happens with the plane, right? Right. I mean, given how long of a flight do you have? How much travel do you have to do? Oh, he needs to get in the plane. One hour and a half. I got 12 hours and a whole different day in another time zone. So, you know, a little bit of rest and...
Engin Terzi: I'll be ready to go. When are we weighing in? So you don't care about weight? It doesn't matter how big I am. He said it doesn't matter. I could come in super heavy then. But you said that there will not be so much weight difference anyways. Nah, there won't. Okay. It's Friday morning. Okay, let's talk about a little bit East versus West. Basically, I understood what you guys are saying. Daniel seems like
Engin Terzi: Sorry, Daniel, but it sounds that way that Daniel is just very, very confident. And I'm glad he doesn't see any way that you beat him while you're coming there to beat him. But you don't want to talk too much. This is how I feel. Take me lightly, Daniel. Take me lightly. Devon't train. You don't need to train. I'm old.
Daniel Procopciuc: he says he didn't change anything in his training but he is going to train so he's saying that he didn't change anything he's not doing anything specific for you exactly yeah let's see what about will happen if douglas is gonna surprise us again
Engin Terzi: or not because douglas i say surprised because on the polls this guy looks heavily favored as you also said that on the paper he looks but you are coming here to shock the world this is how i see you yeah i don't see you are intimidated i only see you right now more motivated like let me teach him a lesson type of
Engin Terzi: thing I see right now is what I see. I mean, I want to bring him back down to you. You'll bring him down there. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so let's talk about some other matches. Let's talk about some other matches. And let's start with Adam Wojcicki and Bacho Bacho Saginashvili. Daniel,
Engin Terzi: Do you know anything about Bacho Bacho Saginashvili? And you know Adam, right? Adam, he pulled against Bojidar. He's a strong guy. And whenever I talk with the Georgii guys, they think that this Bacho is incredible. And they say that he will beat anyone. You know, just right now, Zurab won AMC events in Russia.
Daniel Procopciuc: And they say he and Zurab is 50-50. So how do you see Adam Wozniński versus Baciu? He says he doesn't know how Baciu...
Daniel Procopciuc: pulling, you know, what's his style, you know. But if he's going into hook, he may have a chance. Otherwise, he doesn't think he can top roll Adam. I understand. They say that his inside and top roll both very good days, is what they say, yeah. And how do you think about this much, Douglas? This is for me, for me, it's just like
Engin Terzi: Like, I have no idea. I know Adam. I know how strong he is. He's incredible. About Bacho, I don't know. All I know is what they say. Do you think that someone at 18 years old can be so strong and just suddenly beat someone like Adam? Do you think it's possible? I think that's going to be one of the...
Doug Erlich: the deciding factors is, with him being so young, is his hand there? Because Adam has that. If the match stops, even if he gets that, even if Bacho gets that early win, Adam...
Doug Erlich: can drain him and he'll be really good in those later rounds because he can he can pull for days so i'm assuming this match goes inside and if that's the case i'm i'm going with adam for sure 60 40. so you are saying that that doesn't look very possible a young kid to just come and show the world super edit level you know like he's just
Doug Erlich: They're out there and they're out there and they do it, you know, and every now and then one will pop up. But, you know, I know the Georgii think really highly of him, but, you know, this is going to be his first time on this kind of a stage. Adam does not let, he's got ice in his veins. He doesn't let that stuff get to him. And we saw that in his last event. And this was, and it was the biggest thing he had ever done to that point. And to do that. He was underdog against Bozidar.
Engin Terzi: he won and he and he had like i said he had ice in his veins yeah he basically um acted like he'd been doing it for years up there yeah yeah yeah yeah he was he was here yeah strong very strong mentally very strong yeah and let's talk about another match alison murado versus cody merits daniel i think i think alison will win cody merits
Engin Terzi: which way which side hook hook yeah side hook and his his faster you know yeah what what does he think about uh alijan that someone at 95 kilo being so effective against heavier guys what does he think about alijan
Daniel Procopciuc: so he's he's very fast you know very uh fast twitch fiber you know yeah but he is also good endurance daniel you saw him against petrenko petrenko was 105 kilo and alison was 95 kilo but even the match stopped
Daniel Procopciuc: stop and he can still fight he fights this way he fights this way comes closer shoulder the guy is just trying everything yeah he says the the he his left is is very good you know his universal you know there's a lot of uh he's very versatile you know so yeah he can pull in different ways
Engin Terzi: Yeah, fast, which also good endurance as well. You know, he actually exhausted Oleg Petrenko at the end, you know, like Oleg Petrenko was exhausted. Ali John was still effective, you know. So fast, which also very good endurance together at the same time. Very dangerous guy. Also very smart guy. How do you see this match, Douglas? You know, Kody is probably one of the
Engin Terzi: two or top three probably top two even he was considered number one before his match against corey west and now he is pulling against alicia murado you were there when alican pulled the petrenko and but of course petrenko is 105 kilo uh light heavyweight while for the marriage is triple weight so how do you see this one
Doug Erlich: I think Kody is extremely strong, but. Allison's speed is such an X factor. He's so explosive. And he's he can get you out of position. I don't like picking against
Doug Erlich: you know, Team West, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a homer big time, but I'd have to say Alijon's a favorite here. He's, he's so fast and he's got a lot of endurance and he can pull in, like you said, in so many different angles. It's going to be, Kody's got a really good lane. And if he can get a good start round one, I think he can make it a match.
Doug Erlich: But I I'd have to, I'm leaning towards hours on. He's just too explosive. I don't, I just, I'd, I'd pick him just, uh, I'd pick him against just about anybody right now. Hmm. I understand. I understand. And then let's go to do another one. Uh, Brandon assessor versus commercial. Yeah. Yeah.
Daniel Procopciuc: he says he doesn't really know a lot about brandon but against pretty much anybody you know he will bet on uh because he wants to be the first that uh yeah so he wants to rematch
Doug Erlich: yeah yeah 100 okay okay okay you gotta beat me first you gotta beat me first daniel are you looking past me there we go looking past me i'm telling you that's that right there is see in the future you just you just you just feel your loss looking past me you just sealed it looks like looks like he sees you
Engin Terzi: if he is your match like a paycheck or something you know like no i need to punish this guy you need to punish this guy i can't wait you're in trouble oh
Engin Terzi: To be honest, I don't remember his arm this big. Can you show one more time, Dania? Wow. Especially the forearm, where the pronator and everything is developed. That's all where it matters, you know? That's all it matters. Yeah, but the doctor said that he doesn't care about what's happening here. He said that he's going to take the...
Engin Terzi: yeah tell tell danielle to uh not to get me wrong you understand i'm just trying to steal the pot i don't have any anyone to hold side i'm an organizer yeah he knows it yeah he knows he knows yeah okay okay good good good um anyway and so let's go to another one um
Doug Erlich: talk about rob versus drop that was so i like this you know and i like that zarab is uh just about anybody except like my my boys like paul and uh and also rob i would
Doug Erlich: i like i like zarev i think he's not only a hell of an arm wrestler he's a good dude we had a good time last time i was in turkey and i think he is he's leveling up every time we see him this guy is not the same guy we saw against john against chance against uh ron he's he's getting stronger and stronger and stronger and he just put on an amazing performance at amc
Doug Erlich: But none of those guys are Rob. Rob, you don't know what you're pulling until you grab Rob. He is different. He is built different. He is different. And I'm going with Rob 60-40. And I think a lot of people that are picking Rob right now,
Doug Erlich: they're going off these highlights that he's got right now and he's killing it. He's doing great, but that just sets up for a big opportunity for Rob. I have a question for you. Where do you think Rob is right now? He's very near to his prime? It'd be hard to say without getting with him personally in training because I haven't had an opportunity to train with him. You guys don't have any plan to meet?
Doug Erlich: Him and Paul are. I'm not able to. I've got someone coming to train with me today. I don't have an opportunity to get up there. It's a long flight. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You are at a stop right now. Yeah, it's tough with the other stuff I have going on, juggling that. But Rob, he's getting there. He's getting close and he's making ground. It's the same situation I went through with my last match.
Doug Erlich: Rob is training, coming back. I expect him to be in really good form, but he'll be in even better form in his next match. So he's dedicated and he's training every day. And we talk just about every day. And I know he's working his ass off. Yeah. And Daniel, how do you see this? Rob versus Rob Biggins?
Daniel Procopciuc: He said the favorite is Zurab, but he wonders how much the AMC tournament affected him, you know, because a lot of heavy hitters in that tournament, you know, and a lot of tough matches.
Unknown: He wonders how this tournament will affect him, but he is the favorite. So, he's saying that it's up to drop shape after AMC? Yeah, he doesn't know how it will affect the AMC tournament, but he is the favorite.
Unknown: If he maintains his shape from AMC, he will 100% win, you know? I understand, I understand. Okay, let's go to another one. And Arif Ertem versus Dzeranov, Daniel.
Engin Terzi: how do you how does he think in which way he's gonna win just straight side pressure yeah yeah yeah side pressure i understand i understand and douglas do you know these guys i do is the one that pulled against corey
Doug Erlich: and you were not here when when zaranova he pulled against alenishenko and wagner he beat both of them 3-2 i watched it and he's not i watched that one i was there with arif but when he pulled uh corey but i think uh and i think uh i mean rf's side pressure in his top role is too good i i think
Doug Erlich: You know, he's not going to give up and he's going to fight. And I think it makes for a good match, but I think it's going to be 3-0. Do you think the Arab is going to win? Yeah, I was super impressed with him with Corey last event. I mean, Corey is a strong dude. And I know Corey pulled a left-handed match and, you know, kind of blew his load on that match. But, like, I really – Corey is strong and he went right through him. Yeah, yeah. There was almost like four hours between two matches, sir.
Doug Erlich: Yeah. I mean, let's go to do another one. Let's start with Douglas directly. Pauline versus Sasho. Well, I know, I know this for a fact that Paul's confidence in himself, uh, where his table output is right now, his strength, um, he is, he's in better form than he was when he pulled Rusum.
Doug Erlich: I think he learned a lot in that match of what not to do, changing plan, you know, changing his plan. And I'm really confident. Right now, it's a coin flip for me. I think it's 50-50. If Paul gets his lane, I think Paul wins. If Paul gets into his power, I think Paul wins. Can I ask you something? You don't need to give me detail, but because you are close, very close with Paul.
Doug Erlich: all in his mind did he decide what he needs to do 100 he's right he's he's got he's got his plan he's got his plan a and he's he's gonna go with it and he's gonna he's gonna die and live and die on that sword so he's he's ready he's he's very ready mentally he's extremely ready yeah yeah people just wrote here andrew rose here that four weeks and something really
Engin Terzi: it's like only four weeks and four days and then another is versus what amazing yeah anyway so how do you see paul versus sasho daniel sasho sasho yeah i understand and he says hook easy
Daniel Procopciuc: in the hook it will be easy yeah he knows uh paul is like on a on a good run you know but uh sasho is uh he prepares very well you know and it's a bad matchup can i ask him something we know that sasho is not really 95 kilo guy he is around 90 kilo guy
Engin Terzi: sometimes even 88 kilo sometimes 91 kilo around there but let's say 90 kilo guy if if samusha was 90 kilo and if sasho is 90 kilo and if they go inside would sasho win easy or it would be a good match easy i think easy social easy yeah and and do you do you think that like is there anyone that can beat sasho
Unknown: under 95 kilo in your opinion since you think that it's gonna be fully uncooked do you think
Engin Terzi: He said with the weight, with 100 kilos, this weight, you know, he can. No, no, no. Zurab was 95 kilos, AM7, not 100 kilos. In the East versus West, it's a 95-kilo category. That would be a very interesting match. He wants to see, you know. And will he be surprised if Pauline beats Sasho?
Unknown: Yes. Dave you seen Pauline going hook with John Burzine? Did you see those matches? I haven't seen them. I had an event with John Burzine.
Daniel Procopciuc: but john uh from the super match with john yeah it was a super match it was a long match and john even get injured from his uh forearm muscle he became like so red you know but he was very tough he says uh uh john was just uh like uh coming back you know and then his hook was weaker he thinks than sascha right now you know because did you did you did he know that
Engin Terzi: after Rambet versus Zurab match. He remembers that Zurab Rambet? Yeah, after that match, later Pauline also beat Rambet and he hook him and beat him without so much struggle. Yeah, he says Zurab is
Daniel Procopciuc: You don't know which Zurab is going to show up, you know, because of his strength, you know. Sometimes he prepares very well, you know. Daniel thinks that there is no possibility that Paul is quite a strong guy. It's very strong, but not like that.
Engin Terzi: he says he thinks he's very strong uh uh but but not like uh like sasha and uh and so he's saying that sasha is gonna yeah yeah yeah okay yeah and and but not as social yeah and and and that was you are saying it's a 50 50 match i think it's 50 50 and if if uh
Doug Erlich: I look, you can't judge it based on that rooster match. You know, Paul learned a lot from that match and we saw what happened in match three. So it roostoms hooked right there with Sasho. So if we're going to if we're going to sit here with the question, is there anybody that can beat Sasho under 95 when you ask Daniel that? I mean, how's roostom not in that conversation? And we saw when Paul committed.
Engin Terzi: to putting his frame in it and committed to the hook we saw that match we saw that match stop so yeah he is here saying that what what what does daniel think that first two rounds pauline tried to attack uh rustam's hand and round three he went inside and what does he think about round three that you know when he went inside
Daniel Procopciuc: Daniel says Rustam had a very big break, you know. So he can't really judge his shape, you know. I mean, he did his best to prepare. But it was not enough like training camp, you know.
Engin Terzi: uh for like a high level match like spawn i understand i understand i understand everyone's opinions and let's go to the next one what do you think about lalettan versus tobias douglas i do i i think lalettan is going to be too much for him i think he's too long too explosive i just i
Doug Erlich: I don't think Toby's can slow him down. I think that's going to be, if he does, it'd be, I mean, I'm, I'm 70, 30 little. I think, uh,
Doug Erlich: His move is really hard to deal with. There's only a few people in the world that can actually deal with it. His length, his height, how explosive he is. And he's relentless, too. If he gets your hand, he doesn't stop. You know, he doesn't sit there and try and burn you out. I mean, he's going to the pad. So it's hard to bet against Laletin. Daniel, do you remember Tobias versus Morozov, left-arm supermatch?
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Do you remember when Morozo tried to top roll Tobias? He tried top rolling, but he just lose so easy. So Morozo beat him with a supinated hook. But whenever he attacked Tobias' hand, Tobias' hand was very strong. With Tobias and Laletin, they have the strongest grip in the arm wrestling community. Do you think that because of Laletin's the low hand, low hand, this,
Engin Terzi: Do you think that there is any chance for Tobias to win? Or do you think that Laletin is going to win, as Douglas is thinking? I don't know how much he trained on the left side. He trained a lot on the right side.
Daniel Procopciuc: So he says he doesn't really know which how his shape is on the left hand you know but he doesn't really know anybody can stop Laletin from getting the top roll you know so
Engin Terzi: Does he remember the Serrano versus Laletin Edouard with left arm? The Serrano. Side pressure, yeah. Yeah, side pressure, but first back pressure, and then not like this side, but more like to do, you know, pronating. Like, not like to do arm side pressure, but more like back first, back pressure, back pressure, and then side pressure, yeah. And also the killer push.
Daniel Procopciuc: yeah he is he was at 100 kilos you know laletin has a very big frame and uh oh he's now much bigger and stronger yeah yeah so so daniel is thinking that there is not possibility for uh phobias to beat me
Daniel Procopciuc: uh maybe only only chance for tobias is is just to surprise uh with uh something with speed uh like he did with uh pudnik the question is um he thinks that laletin is gonna win is laletin gonna top roll obvious or side pressure total top or even top roll him so he will take tobias wrist
Engin Terzi: Okay, I understand. Yeah. Okay, let's go last three matches. Also very, very good matches. Okay, Revaz Lutidze Douglas versus Dave Sheffy. Today, Revaz Lutidze said that he respects Dave so much, but he needs to really destroy him. He said that he will do this respectfully, but he has to do that. What do you think about this?
Doug Erlich: I like Revis. I think he's a having he's a monster, but I'm not picking against Dave, especially with the amount of rest he's had and training that he's had since Hermes. You know, he didn't have a big break between letting in Hermes. And I think that did affect him. And I think people are forgetting. Well, not really based on the polls. I mean.
Doug Erlich: Most people are picking Dave, but you cannot forget where Dave is. Dave is still arguably top three. I mean, we really don't know. I mean, we'll let him come back in this match and make a determination off of that, but I'm going Dave all the way. I never pick against Dave. Okay, and Dania? I think Dave. Yeah, Dave. Dave, how the match is going to go? Easy or hard?
Daniel Procopciuc: no easy but they yeah with side pressure yeah so you said it's not easy so you think that ravers is gonna stop today or uh he said the the first matches will will be easy you know but maybe like uh
Engin Terzi: third match maybe it's going to get a little a little closer okay so he's saying that probably first one or two rounds david's gonna dominate revas and then round three maybe it will be harder but he's still gonna win this is what he's saying yeah yeah i understand i understand and let's go to do another one daniel let's start with you iraqli versus
Daniel Procopciuc: Just give us, just give us analyzing, not only score. He said he think of course he both of them will pull top hole, you know.
Daniel Procopciuc: but uh he thinks um uh iraqi will lose his uh wrist you know and uh uh he will be forced to pull with uh his wrist a little bit not not not like all the way you know but uh yeah exactly so yeah it's very very hard to apply so much power unless you are like kata things it is better to just totally dive it and then press it you know but
Daniel Procopciuc: And does he think that he can do the same thing as he did to John or not? He said Ongarbaev will win. He thinks close match but he thinks Ongarbaev will win and also Ongarbaev has right now because
Daniel Procopciuc: John injuries, you know, has a better side pressure, you know, and he will not be pressed, you know, like John was, you know. So even if he, if Irakli tries to push with the dead risk press, you know, it will not be enough to pin Ongarbaev. Yeah. Hello, my friend. Good to hear from you.
Engin Terzi: Thank you. And I have a question. Is there anyone on this earth that can beat Ongarbaev under 105 kilo? Maybe John, maybe Prudnik, maybe, maybe if, what if Devon goes down to 105 kilo? Like who can beat Ongarbaev? Because since he thinks that he's going to be the right. He said Prudnik at 105. Prudnik? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: like he did at the top eight yeah do you think that there is a possibility that it may be different especially now yeah okay okay so does he think that brutnik is the strongest guy under 105 kilo the best yeah
Daniel Procopciuc: uh what's the hot weight right now a lot of these like he he is normally 120 kilo so but that's he can make 105 does he think that if he goes 105 he can still beat uh he said uh he thinks uh larat will lose if he goes down to 105.
Engin Terzi: Do you think that Grudnik is a harder opponent for Larratt or Ongarbaev is a harder opponent for Larratt at 105 kg? I don't think it's harder for Larratt at 105 kg. For Larratt, I think Ongarbaev has a different style and pulls up better.
Engin Terzi: so for for larat he says ongar bayer will be more difficult because his style of uh of control pressure and control you know like uh does he think that he can control larat possible yeah because he continues absolutely so prudnik prudnik prudnik beats ongar because of hook but since larat is going outside so he thinks that ongar bayer has more chance against uh
Engin Terzi: Can I ask you, can you ask him another question? You know, Devon did not pull a lot against the Eastern guys in his career. So many people didn't know much about him. Can you tell him if he saw his match against Sandris, Devon versus Sandris, did you see? Also, if he saw, after he saw Devon against Brudnich and Devon against Sandris, sorry.
Daniel Procopciuc: Did Daniel's opinion change about Devon and his abilities as an armwrestler? It was exactly like that. He was waiting for me.
Engin Terzi: He said, in his opinion, Pudnik is above Sandris, you know, and he was totally expecting the... Sandris to lose? Yeah, yeah. But can you also, I know you continue, but Sandris is the current WAF world champion, not like a regular guy. And he was probably over 115 kg. And the match didn't look so close.
Daniel Procopciuc: So, like, okay, you continue. You continue translating it. So, I mean,
Daniel Procopciuc: he says he's different classes you know even like uh like uh one he competes in raf you know and putting is a professional you know like he's the best in the world you know like top three you know like uh this one oh five one ten category
Daniel Procopciuc: focus 100 on pulling professionally you know on on this weight you know like and things will be different 120 you know after like two years you know maybe maybe it will be a different uh story but uh he was not uh at all surprised you know yeah but that's that's that's it that's the thing that like did his the main question is did his opinion change about
Daniel Procopciuc: Devon's abilities. No, no, no, not at all. You know, like it was exactly as expected, you know, after he saw the Prudnik match. I'm talking about after Prudnik match as well. Like, like, like did he, like, does he think that Devon is a very dangerous player? Yeah, I think we like,
Daniel Procopciuc: Even me, he thinks after Prudnik, he changed his opinion regarding Devon's abilities. He didn't expect the match, but after the match with Prudnik, he expected to beat Sanders like this.
Engin Terzi: as i also did he realized that this guy is not a normal guy about endurance and many other things you know he's dangerous his pronator is um very very dangerous guy yeah and you what do you think about uh
Doug Erlich: Douglas, I honestly, it's probably my favorite match on the card. I do want to see John if I think I was going to win. I want to see John again. But, you know, it's so amazing about this and about being able to be there as an arm wrestling fan as well. After I beat Daniel, I get to watch all these matches, you know.
Engin Terzi: That's going to be fun. It will be your reward, right? Your reward. You will feed him and then relax and have some snacks. Yeah, I'm going to send Daniel to go grab me some drinks and snacks. Daniel says these good matches will be like a consolation prize after he loses, you know?
Engin Terzi: come up with your own material, Daniel. That's what I just said. Okay. That's exactly what I just did. No, no. He said, you said that it will be a reward for you, but he said that it will be not reward, but it will be consolation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Just, just, just keep it, keep it yourself till the press conference. And then at the competition, I just can't wait. I just can't wait.
Engin Terzi: If you are going to make this guy, Daniel, not smile anymore, or if he will continue smiling at the table to you, I can't wait, you know, which one to see. Yeah, I'm going to wipe that smile off his face. Look at that. I can't stop. Do you smile when you lose, too? Do you smile when you lose? It's going to go into my face.
Doug Erlich: No. He says no. Ongarbaev is the answer to the question, though. I think Ongarbaev wins that match. I think he takes I think they both
Doug Erlich: are going outside and it's going to, they may over rotate and it's going to be side pressure. And I think, uh, just, I think he's too much. Uh, I mean, it's going to be a match though. It's going to be a really, really good match. I don't think it's going to end up three. I don't think it will be three. Oh, either way. I think it's going to be, it might be the match of the night. We will see. We will see my friend. I hope so. And you should get the video pop up and match to would like to everyone.
Engin Terzi: Tiberio, there was going to be a qualification, but it's not going to happen anymore. And I think the last qualification was Riga Open, I think. I'll just prepare for the next qualification. No problem. Just get ready. Okay, let's go to the last match.
Doug Erlich: Devon Larratt versus Genadi Kubikvenia. This one, I want to start first with Douglas. I think Genadi gets him first round. I really do. I think Genadi is going to take the first round. I think he has a really strong possibility of taking the second round. He is relentless.
Doug Erlich: But, man, this match is going to be fireworks because we see how Genadi, how explosive he is and animated he is on the stage. If he gets that first win on Devon, I mean, it's going to be explosive. And I don't know. It's Devon. Devon is going to find a way to stop the match, though. And I think the match ends up 3-2 Devon.
Doug Erlich: And he'll find a way to start. He always finds a way, man. He always finds a way. Now he's going to put him on that Kings move now. He's going to put him on his, he's going to put him, put him there. A lot of it's going to depend on how the refs are calling that too. Is Devon going to get fouled out there? Because. I mean, as I said, you know, if it is the, who matters is part of that. That's okay. Once it is down angle, then it's the foul. We will make this clear. We will make this so clear.
Engin Terzi: So there will not be an argument. This is not a new rule. Right, right. This has been there. We will talk, referees, everyone will talk. So there will not be any argument about it. And I think that one before, Devon went down, you know, and then I think it was called late when he played against Brutnik. Yeah, they called it.
Engin Terzi: but they call it late you know it went down you know like longer you know maybe extra 10 seconds you know there was but then then whenever i talk with the referees that you know listen this this is not what i'm saying if it is parallel okay if this is you directly call it so they kind of get a little bit too sensitive and i think they call when michael was to me it was like parallel you know it was not like really like this but they stood behind their their
Engin Terzi: uh decision of course it didn't affect you know there was some other fouls that was not called on michael in round one when he won either but it doesn't matter you know where this happening i i want a single standard you understand i i want everything to be more more clear you know and and i think that'll come into play a little bit in this match and i think it'll come into play in my match too i think daniel's gonna be like this so um
Engin Terzi: we'll have to we'll have to have the refs watching daniel cloak really woke but my pick is devin three twos deletio devon and and daniel daniel what is the score and how the match is gonna go tell us technically you are technically very very good guy you know so i want to hear your opinion
Daniel Procopciuc: He said regarding the score it's a toss-up, but it will be Devon's Kings move against Genadi's press.
Daniel Procopciuc: And both of them have very, very good endurance, you know, so this is why it's a toss up, you know, because also Genadi has a very good endurance. So... 50-50. 50-50? Yeah. And Dania, who do you want to win? It's Kuchinti. Devon. You want Devon?
Engin Terzi: yeah tell him tell him that he is a betrayer of the team east was this good i i i will tell the old georgians to rewas lebanon is coming and then other gennady is coming and they will they will
Engin Terzi: Daniel out on the team. The Georgii are rooting for me anyway in our match, so it's only fair. Ah, yeah. They've all messaged me already. After this, the whole Georgii team will probably support Douglas. And now Daniel is in trouble. Yeah.
Doug Erlich: So he's saying the 50-50, but he wants Devon to win. Okay. Anyway, so guys, do you want to say anything more to each other? I think, you know, Daniel is an extremely high level. He's going to be the toughest match I've ever had. The most accomplished arm wrestler I've ever pulled. And I talk a lot of shit, but
Doug Erlich: This is a match I've wanted because I consider him the best in the world. So I'm going to come in ready for war, but I know what I'm up against, and I think I want that spot. I want to be considered one of the best, and if you want to be considered one of the best, you've got to beat that guy.
Daniel Procopciuc: And Daniel, do you have anything to say? The last words. Unfortunately for Doug, the number one spot will remain with Daniel, but it will be a very good match, you know, like without injuries and a very good
Engin Terzi: show for the for the fans yeah yeah there is one guy my friend let me explain to you the rule this is maybe you are not so uh experienced in our nursing but dizzy when they say who matters they are talking about natural at the beginning position and losing position when they talk who matters they don't talk about winning position when you are in a winning position
Engin Terzi: Your humerus is not playing a role as a lever like this. Whenever you are like this, there is nothing lever. You're pressing down. You are not elevating your elbow or hand up. So I think that many of you guys misunderstand this rule. Gary is in this position. This position, you will find 95% of the top rowers in the same position. This is not what they are talking about when they say,
Engin Terzi: the humerus bone being down angle. It is about neutral and losing position. Not even winning position. I'm just trying to explain to you as a friend, because I see a lot of people are also thinking that way. He said that agent of cows, Daniel may be the best in the world, pound for pound. Left arm possible, right arm, he needs to prove this. Right arm. Do you agree that Daniel? The guy said that you may be the best
Engin Terzi: So I think the right left arm possible, right arm, he needs to be more prudent. He said he will go prove that is with right also, you know, this year.
Daniel Procopciuc: i understand but but as so far it's not proving it does he agree with that he said he he he's he's still recovering after he's right you know he's still not as uh
Engin Terzi: He's not at 100% full potential on the right, you know. And he will prove that he's also pound for pound number one. I understand. But what I'm just saying is whenever we talk about pound for pound number one, when we talk about proving yourself, we are not usually talking about one time winning the World Championships. We talk about his left arm because he repeatedly
Engin Terzi: have done many years. Even winning one time this year, in my opinion, not disrespect, he's one of the strongest right arm as well. One of the strongest right arm as well. But even winning one time world championships doesn't prove that he's the strongest pound for pound. He needs to repeatedly, repeatedly, he needs to, yeah. What does he think about a left arm match?
Engin Terzi: against Alan Zaluev? He says at any time, you know, left and right with Alan Zaluev. He wants that match, of course. Can I ask him something? What if I set him May 6th with left arm with Alan Zaluev, left arm, but it is 75 kilo world title.
Daniel Procopciuc: Does he think that he can go down to 75 kilos and then can still pull Douglas with right arm and left arm with Alain Zollet? He says no problem. Yeah, because his weight is now 78.
Engin Terzi: yeah he's very close 17 if he makes 75 friday morning after the evening again he will be 78 79 right yeah yeah exactly yeah okay but but douglas may not like this idea what do you think hey i i don't care he can pull alan first yeah would you would you mind to pull in the same event i don't think that he's gonna come with an excuse
Doug Erlich: No, I'm good with it. I'm good with whatever. Because a loss is a loss, man. That's it. You're going to have a long uphill climb to get that right arm as pound for pound after you take an L to an old man like me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just destroy this guy. Make him smile. Go down. Yeah. Yeah.
Daniel Procopciuc: yeah daniel daniel says said uh that uh be careful you don't want the daniel without the smile you know no that's the daniel i want it'll make for a much better show he don't want the daniel without the smile you know he wants well he's a good guy you know you pull alan left-handed first and i'll pull you after okay
Engin Terzi: We will see. We will see. Let me talk because Alain Zola may have a hard time to get out of his country. But it's just like brain gymnastics, you know, just nothing else. And we will see. We will see. Okay. Anyways, thank you very much, Douglas. Thank you, my friend. I wish you the best. Just destroy this guy. Destroy him. Oh, yeah. He's in trouble. I'm telling you. Look at this thing. You're dead, Dave.
Engin Terzi: yeah daniel you take care of yourself my friend and see you in istanbul and i wish you guys the best of uh preparation you you both take care thank you very much thank you for the translation guys see y'all later no problem yeah take care yeah
