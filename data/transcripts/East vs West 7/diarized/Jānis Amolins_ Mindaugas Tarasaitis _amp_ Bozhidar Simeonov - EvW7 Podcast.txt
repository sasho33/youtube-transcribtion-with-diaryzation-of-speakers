Mindaugas Tarasaitis: sorry guys hello hello hello hello obviously the bicep bicep is i don't know i don't know about bicep but forearm looks good i don't know maybe it looks to me that way but it looks good huh you should never ask me how how my
Speaker: Mm-hmm.
Jānis Amolins: Soon my guest will come. I don't know. We will see how beastly I am when I'm competing. I don't think I can directly compete against where the best guys, you know, I don't think so. I think that
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: they will be probably too much but i can do a little bit below you know uh the best guys thank you thank you ryan thank you fun thank you mega flies art and oleg's live love child i am so happy every time in tennessee live streams hello hello my friends hello
Jānis Amolins: Thank you. Training is not bad, but still far from the best. I don't know if I can reach anywhere close to the best, but I can say probably depends, you know, depends. Maybe the arm strength is probably 70%, but we will see. We will see.
Jānis Amolins: Adnan, thank you for your motivation. I don't know, my friend. I will pull under 90 kg for sure. My plan is 85 kg for sure. I don't know if I can make 75 kg.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: But 85 kilos looks very possible. I'm around 96 kilos right now. 96 kilos. I need to lose weight. My explosiveness? Very hard, my friends. Very hard. I don't know. You never know. We will see.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: i have pulled great tools when 23 years ago 23 years ago it was final arm wrestling for nerds yes a couple of spots are open for vip my friends
Jānis Amolins: um jp you sound like a historian but hello mr terzi how are your wrists now many months after your injection i'm not sure my friend i'm not sure i mean i feel i feel okay but we will see we will see you know i i don't like stem cells are not like like it doesn't make you like strong it's not like something hormonal you know it is
Jānis Amolins: like for joints, you feel more comfortable. I mean, sometimes I feel very comfortable. Sometimes I have pain with the injections. Hello, Yanis. Hello. Hello, my friends. Hello, Engin. Good to see you, my friend. You were talking about stem cells with the bands, true arm wrestling bands. They are, they are, they love arm wrestling. They not super.
Jānis Amolins: drama and toxic things but you know they are they are focused on arm wrestling hello to lebanon so how have you been janice oh fine fine it's yeah it's it's holiday so did some did some uh few hours cardio beach tennis indoors with wife and friends yeah that's good yeah being active sauna so
Jānis Amolins: all good all good yeah it's a it's a live stream already yeah yeah yeah we are live yeah that's how i was chatting with them so now okay someone else came i think okay that is bojidar hey today today today i will be hosting
Jānis Amolins: lightweight things lightweight kings greetings boys yeah hello hello how are you doing you are you are you are the only boy here or now you are two boys now after mindago's king two boys yeah two boys one middle-aged man and then one old man we are
Jānis Amolins: Yeah, three perfectly shaped top rollers and one hook puller. Yeah, three top rollers, yeah. I'm not feeling really comfortable here. Yeah, you shouldn't. You shouldn't, yeah. I have seen you winning a few titles just with top rolls, so it's not really true. Who did he win? When did he win the top roller? Yeah.
Jānis Amolins: Bozidar? Yeah, I don't remember. Left arm, yes. Yeah, it was left arm. Also with right arm, time to time, your top roll is maybe not less effective than hook, so it's good. I think in previous WAF, you were pulling a lot with top roll. A lot in many fights. Yeah.
Jānis Amolins: I don't know. I see that he usually applies side pressure when he pulls against Viorel Dobrin. And when he beat Gachevski at the 2021 final, also side pressure straight. But top roll, left arm, I can say pure top roll. Right arm, hook, or side pressure. His side pressure is also very good. Yeah, yeah. Of course. I have seen Bojidar losing against hook pullers more than I have seen him
Jānis Amolins: losing against top rollers. I will try to convert it for this year. You will try to lose more often against top rollers. I heard that Mindaugas is going to help you for a good start. Yeah, we hope so at some point of this year. You hope that he's going to help you about that thing?
Jānis Amolins: i hope we are going to pull at some point okay okay okay what what is his chance about properly let him say i don't know come on come on come on he just joined the challenge 100 percent what was it 100 percent yeah 100 chance like a full clean top roll fully open hand by bojidar
Jānis Amolins: And you believe that, right? Of course, of course, yeah. I'm old, I have bad memory. What's the record between you two about the top? That's the thing I wanted to ask as well. When was the last time we saw something similar? I think they only pulled once, like two times, but in the same event, the best 78 kilo event in the final. That was the only time we met him.
Jānis Amolins: But you know, Bojidar is not progressing anymore at all. I'm just going up and up. Yeah, yeah, that's true. That's what I also heard from Aydar Khan. He told me the same thing. Listen, this guy is my guest, but I'm being too hard on him. Just like such a terrible person I am. Terrible, terrible, seriously. I like to provocate him, you know. I like to provocate him. I just didn't know about the test of seat.
Jānis Amolins: until this event so sorry say it again you didn't know about the test succeeds uh supplemental until this event before them yeah it will be great janice did you complete the qualification are you coming to istanbul to compete i i will i will go to istanbul about competition we'll see we'll see 78
Jānis Amolins: yeah yeah of course of course but i will go i will go yeah yeah we'll be there yeah about competition we'll see it's uh if uh everything fine good day i could compete yeah yeah pull in the final with ray oh left arm possible right arm there are also some other good guys
Jānis Amolins: if i will go i will not pull left arm for sure that's that's for sure if i will go i will pull only if i will pull out only right arm yeah yeah left arm is not sure some youtube will be there but yusuf will be pulling nationals only a week before at 72 kilo we have 70 kilo but two kilo tolerance so he will be 72 kilo but he eats drinks he's 72 kilo maximum you know he just
Jānis Amolins: let's see let's see um how he can do but he will be maybe too late for the category christoph's christmas bloomers will go as well yeah oh another dangerous emra will be there yeah i think you guys you guys put them
Jānis Amolins: meet each other as well he was third you were fourth but you didn't meet each other because yeah yeah we pulled his left arm but we didn't meet with right yeah yeah you beat him left time yeah but on false on pause just lucky ah your left arm is dangerous too just like if the guy is not like super strong then if he's only playing chess game then he doesn't have
Jānis Amolins: my chance against you. So you said I can beat someone who is not too strong with his left. Is that what you said? No, but when I'm saying that your left arm is not like, like to me at least, is not like, how to say, like, best, like, I don't think you can pull, when he is in very good shape, someone like, what's the Aktaev, or someone like,
Jānis Amolins: i shouldn't say but me i'm talking about left arm no no it's true it's true your left arm is here my opinion there has been days when my left is not uh terrible that's true but it's never been great it's never been great yeah i mean there's been times you did final you got medal i remember
Jānis Amolins: Yeah, yeah, I remember. You were in a finalist. Didn't you beat Java in 2012? No, I have been four times with left in a top three in Worlds. Four times I could be there. I remember. It was the first time in 2007. Bulgaria. Did you take right arm or left arm, Georgii? I think left arm. Left arm, yeah. Right even fourth, I think.
Jānis Amolins: Yeah, yeah. What a category was there. I think there was, what was it? Hassan Munev, Lubomir, and Janani Hassanov. Hassanov, yeah. Bulenko, maybe Bulenko as well. Yeah, Bulenko won with left arm over Lubomir. It was a good class, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Arm Karma, thank you for your support. Greetings to four legends. Engin, provocative question for the group. How would each rank the four of them
Jānis Amolins: in their primes weight equal yeah he's asking how we would do against each other in our prime time you know what if the weights are the same i don't know i think would be very close my opinion not with left i don't know but i think all of us are almost in our prime prime time already now except maybe janice i'm still climbing i'm still climbing i'm prime right
Jānis Amolins: I think Engin is prime. Yeah, I wish you knew. I'm pretty sure Engin is in his prime. Yeah. He looks big. Oh, I mean, I'm 96 kilos and just fat. I don't want to show my belly with 96 kilos. You can imagine the rest, you know. But it gives you strength, right? It gives you strength. My belly? No, no, just overall kind of weight, yeah, energy and stuff.
Jānis Amolins: Oh no, I can tell you, whatever I say, you will not believe when I was 60 kilos, I was lifting much more than what I'm lifting right now. But you know, uh, you are telling this much now. I didn't even start doing pull-ups because I'm trying to reach to the level with one arm cable row. Then I will start because I'm 96 kilos.
Jānis Amolins: with two hands. So what is the help of just say 50 kilo? When I was 62 kilo, I was holding 20 kilo in the hand
Jānis Amolins: and on a tongue that the pipe, you know, I was in one on pull-ups. You just figure out the rest, you know, just. I think it's tricky because as we get older, naturally these dynamic movements, they get difficult, but it doesn't really mean that you are weaker enormously, you know, maybe you are. No, no, no, no, trust me. My finger curl, everything is weaker. Like I was 60 kilo. I was holding big butt, 39 kilo full motion. And Yanis would probably know that I never cheat when I lift.
Jānis Amolins: you know i was in full motion 39 kilo the other day i did with two hands 45 kilo like my neck was going to explode you know because of the pressure i shouldn't do so much standing things but
Jānis Amolins: Whenever I put my arm on the bench, somehow elbow hurts more, Yanis. When I do in the air, it hurts less. Probably it's because putting more pressure when you are bringing your elbow forward. When you are pulling back, it is more pressure on the muscle, less pressure on the elbow joint. When you do back pressure, exercise, some biceps curl or? Yeah, yeah. If I put my arm like on a bench, you know, and then if I do,
Jānis Amolins: arm curve that it hurts my elbow more but when in the air i think i i can you know like whenever i do yeah this but more you bring it less back like this less pressure on the elbow it's more muscle more you are going forward now you have more pressure on the elbow joint so that that is why because whenever i do in the air i can bring my elbows back so i i don't feel the the pressure
Jānis Amolins: on the joints as much as when i do on the bench so it but it could be connected also with some problems like uh that one head of biceps is is could be it could be could be that one head of biceps is more problematic or some some problems like position like when you when you put put elbow forward more it's a long head of biceps will work more this is outside of my elbow it has nothing to do with myself
Jānis Amolins: i don't i don't have bicep pain so much you know that the bicep pain happened but now if as long as i don't really push limits it it doesn't sometimes it acts you know but it's fine yeah yeah so what did you do so you still you really believe that uh 90 i don't know 96 or 90 what uh 60 kilo engine could beat you now yes because the hand was incredibly dominant the hands
Jānis Amolins: like my pronator is probably now probably stronger i believe your pronator right now is better than it was before oh yeah that's true but but your pronator's effectiveness has a lot to do with your hand strength if the opponent is a top roller if the operators dive into you you don't need so much risk you just boom you know and then you use full pronator but if the guy is pulling you you really need to
Jānis Amolins: dominate here to hit here with your max if your hand is getting like this then like your your tornado will be losing its effectiveness i can tell you for sure my hand was much stronger than how it is right now maybe in step maybe i can be a little bit closer but without the strap also the signals signals are not coming well you know
Jānis Amolins: again so let's say you you do have many measurements from the past where you know how much you did with your biceps and so on but did you have any measurements where you maybe held something statically um you know just in a block position i'm thinking that maybe your current numbers would be bigger in those no no no i cannot even do like whenever i try to wait up there with pull up i cannot wait it push my elbow
Jānis Amolins: and then one of the reason that you see me doing the full motion training it is not because i only prefer that because i cannot do even the health motion because health motion is putting so much pressure on my elbows but whenever i do the full because when you do health motion when you come to the 90 degree you need to put a break that that's really putting the pressure on my elbow but whenever i pass there without any breaks
Jānis Amolins: It really heals. So my only reason to lift weight right now is not for arm wrestling specific, but just to increase the general strength. Because if I do that, that kind of static at the table and with the weight at the same time, elbow doesn't handle. So I had to choose one of them. So I do this for the general power plus health.
Jānis Amolins: And then I go table, so I use that pressure only at the table. If I do both, it doesn't handle, it will fail, you know. It's too much, yeah. What's that? Yeah, yeah, it's just too much, like too much stress. Whenever I tell to people, like they talk about what is right for our medicine, what's wrong for our medicine.
Jānis Amolins: it's not black and white. It totally depends on your age, your recovery, your health conditions, like many, many things. If you go like, okay, I heard this, so this is what it is, then you will be making a lot of mistakes. You really need to get to know more. That's why I never measure my PRs. I never write down my PRs and
Jānis Amolins: I wouldn't know any number. I never wrote either. I just had a good memory. At least something is not getting worse. Yeah, we are talking like that. I could remember 500 things now. I remember 100 things. And another 200 may come if somebody reminds. But those other 200 is totally gone. I don't know where they are. Archived.
Jānis Amolins: Just useful stuff is still here, so all good. Can I ask one question for Yanis? Yeah, yeah. Are you in a good shape? Like, can I run 300 kilometers under 10 minutes? Yes, I could maybe, yeah. Do you think you could beat me now? In armwrestling? Yes. I don't think so, no. Come on, do you know yourself?
Jānis Amolins: he said he's gonna come istanbul for qualification he will decide there why do you think that he will decide there if he sees you there he's gonna say ah today i don't feel good if he doesn't then he will say let me compete i'm joking yeah but that might be actually true yeah you are not even qualified are you
Jānis Amolins: No, because look, I was, we had something in Armours already planned, right? So I knew that I couldn't make it, but now things are changing. So maybe I will, I don't know. I will, I will think about some. Yeah. I hope, I hope that, uh, Kristaps will clean, clean class before me. So Kristaps will hook Mindaugas and I just will take care of others and that's it. Oh, I think he beat you left arm, right? And easily. Yeah.
Jānis Amolins: oh you got one lucky um i just yeah it happened but it could it couldn't happen three times right you know super much no it wouldn't no way it was nothing it was nothing with luck i think three steps is just strong no of course he isn't but uh but janice can kristaps beat the raimonds
Jānis Amolins: they haven't pulled uh lately i don't know that's just in a practice but that's different i don't know competition competition listen you guys are making me like you know christmas christmas actually we are 20 days away from the east versus west and set us up you know this is like how i feel right now no no don't worry
Jānis Amolins: You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Jānis Amolins: he beat with both hands but he uh right arm he hooked him twice it's not fair to beat someone with both hands yeah sarunas is not really good against hook pullers maybe yeah but he is good against couples ask me nervous yes yes um yeah yeah against hook pullers that maybe not against borges especially
Jānis Amolins: like i'm not getting i'm not trying to get into a match i'm uh for east versus west i'm simply for armor now yeah yeah okay no no it was a joke it was a joke you know but but i could set but i could say if you were not set for armors i would allow you to tell me now right now thingy let's go right there but but again you i didn't know that you had a match there
Jānis Amolins: Yeah, so I have, but now things are changing because Borjedar is maybe not available anymore. So we will see. What do you mean? Like, are you in the cart that is going to happen a week after the East versus West or not? I was, but Borjedar has some problems for work, I guess, right? He cannot really come. Oh, okay. He's afraid of you.
Bozhidar Simeonov: Basically, I'm starting a new job right now, so. Yeah. So now I'm searching, but I'm not afraid at all. I'm feeling great in my shape right now. It's really dope because I'm coming out of an injury injury after a really big break. Like I took three months of break and I went crazy on the table and I ended up injuring myself and I took two months more.
Jānis Amolins: just to recover and right now I'm feeling really, really good. So it's a pity, but yeah, this match it will have to be, but we will do it later, right? Who would you want to pull at the East versus West? If you would, if you could choose. I haven't,
Jānis Amolins: See, look at the camera. Did you see what he was saying? This guy really wants you. You need to give him a lesson. I need to prepare and be healthy. Just give me a lesson. This is what happens, Yanis. When the wolf gets old, you know, you see men around like this, it's just
Jānis Amolins: You know me, I can pull and if I feel good, I can pull. My arm is not 100% for sure, but it's not that bad. But I also don't have any, I don't like those all empty talks about how good I am and I can beat everyone and I will destroy that. I'm always realistic and I know my chances and
Jānis Amolins: And yeah, against Mindaugas, you have to be more or less healthy to pull against him. You need to be in good shape, then it's okay. Yeah, you see, Engin, I'm not really trying to catch Janis while he's already kind of older. I'm doing the opposite. I'm trying to catch Janis while he's still somewhat okay instead of, you know, after five years, it would maybe not be that interesting. So that's why I want to get him now.
Jānis Amolins: Not later. I don't know. He says that he has injuries. By the way, whatever I'm saying, I'm just joking and teasing. Devon't take it seriously. I love to do that. Teams are super matched. I love to do that. We are doing good at it. It was fun, right? Yeah, it was fun before, after. During was even more. During?
Jānis Amolins: during was not so interesting actually yeah and so who should who should alan zoleo pull for sure left arm 75 kilo title he should pull daniel prokopchuk right that's his yeah that's too much yeah and and and right arm he should pull either hand yeah
Jānis Amolins: against him? It's impossible to compare, but I believe yes. I believe yes. Alan's hand, Alan is great. He can pull in long fights. He can pull in any style, but his hand is kind of time is shaking and bending back and he could stay in maybe not so good position from beginning with either hand. Yeah, yeah. So,
Jānis Amolins: it's possible yeah i mean it is good bad or what the guy has the title and the absolutely the guy that who needs to pull him is clear that it's alan zola you know also emil emil looked incredible against him in previous amc events he was just like wow yeah emil is one of the most dangerous lightweights
Jānis Amolins: Yeah, absolutely. But I haven't seen him lately. I don't know when was the last time. Probably in the AMC event against Alonso Leone. But he was not in the last two events. No, he was in the previous one. You didn't see that he hit top rope? Yeah, it was a long fight and Alonso came back with a dead wrist. I don't know why he didn't compete in the next one.
Jānis Amolins: but I don't know. What weight class will you set them? They will be at 75? 75, 75. Listen, I did that, but I'm kind of also maybe like thinking to change the category, like 70, 80, 90, maybe it would be like better, you know, just. And you, Bojidar, you think that Samushia is unbeatable?
Jānis Amolins: I never beat him, so under 85, yes. But do you have any goal about beating him? To beat him? Yeah. Always. Oh, yeah, because Daniel, the other day when I talked about Samushia versus Brandon, Daniel said that he thinks that, you know, Davit is going to win, but he said that he also wants Davit to win. And I said, why?
Jānis Amolins: he said because he wants to be one to beat david so he also has that kind of i i love that i i love people who have like such a strong you know goals you know like i need to beat this guy like that that so much reminds me like my young years you know like how you are obsessed about meeting someone
Jānis Amolins: Yeah, you know, like first time is coincidence. Second time, coincidence. Third time is the charm. So who knows? Okay, Douglas, Douglas says, after I beat Daniel and Nur Dalet, I will pull Alan. So it seems like him to beat Nur Dalet and pull Alan. It sounds like Douglas is hoping to make 75 kilos.
Jānis Amolins: because it's okay right now they are pulling what what weight limit it's 85 85 85 yeah yeah from now on there is no catch rate you know 75 85 95 we don't we don't care you know what their weight is but the category is there you know it's not going to change unless we do make a change for for all the categories there is agent keep it like that and keep it like that i like 75. oh you don't want to pull
Jānis Amolins: Bozidar, okay. 75 is a good place. The only thing that comes to my mind is Bozidar when I said 80. Who else can be that you wouldn't want to pull under 80? Probably no one. No, I'm simply trying to be optimal. I can reach 75, so that seems to be my best weight. Maybe there are some guys who cannot go to 75. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jānis Amolins: Agents of Chaos. Man, I think Prime Yannis would smoke Mindaugas, but now I'm not sure. Mindaugas is strong and his technique is perfect. Will be a good match. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yannis would smoke me back in the day. Yeah.
Jānis Amolins: No, Janis was really, really good. And maybe probably still is. Why was? I just remember Janis coming to our Lithuanian competitions and killing everyone, no matter which weight class it was. So, yeah, I was still quite weak back then, but I could see Janis destroying everyone. So I remember that Janis was really in a special place in these
Jānis Amolins: yeah in these those times good times good time assist creamy thank you for your super chat mean they live for yannis be pull a western guy well that's a good option also i like uh i am sure yannis doesn't like this kind of comments you know like yannis you need to just come and give trust me it is possible to beat this guy even when you are 45 trust me
Jānis Amolins: Engin, you should do a rematch, me and you, no weight limit. No weight limit? No weight limit. When I beat you, I was 75 and a half kilo. I didn't lose the last half kilo because you said, let's go eat together. I said, you go, I will lose the weight. You said, half kilo is no problem, you know. And no weight limit.
Jānis Amolins: oh like like like when i pull like someone like uh like the day that i pull against uh real adobe right yeah for example oh yeah you would kill me oh yeah i will go for it i will take my memory but then i'm
Jānis Amolins: better ways to like for like suicide you know like i mean suicide i mean yeah you can go over a roof or something jump from them down it would be the same effect you know you see i like you being confident i like that i have every reason to be confident i know do you really believe your hand will hold against engines now if you pull in a super match it meant
Jānis Amolins: Things are changing. We are all trying to adjust, improve. That's the point of our progress. We are not staying in the same place. I mean, if he tells me to lose 20 kilos, go 75. I understand. But whenever he says no weight limit, imagine me being heavy and ready, and this guy is just saying no weight limit. It doesn't make sense to you, Yanis. Come on. No. The last time when I tried to adapt to a hierarchy,
Jānis Amolins: weight class i ended up crying in my room for a few hours after i don't match anyway so okay since since since douglas came here and send us uh let's talk about daniel prokopchuk and
Jānis Amolins: I am sure somehow, I don't know why, Mindaugas is gonna say things that will really hurt Douglas. I don't know why, because this guy is type of guy, he's not nice. He just tells whatever on his mind. And I'm sure he thinks very highly about Daniel. And I really have Douglas, just listen. First, I'm gonna ask Mindaugas. I have no idea what he's gonna say. This is only my guess. Go ahead, Mindaugas.
Jānis Amolins: so uh daniel and douglas right yeah uh no douglas is for sure not that bad he's pushing extremely hard now um the peak power maybe the the key thing which will give douglas problems is gonna be endurance i feel like that's gonna be the the issue
Jānis Amolins: If Douglas could maintain his strength for all the rounds, he might have a very good chance. Just tell me how the match is going. Straight, shoulders square, ready, go. What's happening? Tell us. So round one, slip, we go to straps. In straps, Douglas gives Daniel a couple of like three, five seconds
Jānis Amolins: kind of surging in the center, both of them. And then round two, round three. You didn't tell us who wins. Yeah, I don't even know who wins. It doesn't matter who wins round one. Let's say I'm saying it could go either way. But then I'm saying round two, three, four goes to Daniel because Douglas is just, he falls down to like 40% of his peak because of bad endurance. And that's it. That's how I see it.
Jānis Amolins: And where do you see Daniel going? Outside, side, inside? I think he will go inside. Inside. Okay. And Yanis, how do you see this match? It could be like Minda said already. It could be like that. And I kind of believe that Daniel
Unknown: if if he wants he he he will beat uh doug in latest rounds he will be doug both top roller hook he could beat both ways but uh
Jānis Amolins: Doug has a chance maybe with a similar move like he did against Ray to work with good back pressure and go with active wrist and maybe try to get something from Daniel's pronator, but it's very hard. In my eyes, Daniel is clear favorite in this fight. How do you see like a fresh meeting? Is there any possibility Daniel to like,
Jānis Amolins: be stronger than Douglas, or you think that Daniel is going to win because of the endurance? No, no, no. I even believe that Daniel will be the strongest one in this fight. And I'm not saying that Doug don't have a chance. Doug definitely has. But I think it will be very hard for Doug to win even a first round.
Jānis Amolins: If Daniel's taking this seriously, he's very good. The difference is, I talked with Doug a few days ago and the difference with Ray is that Doug is very, Daniel is very effective in this defensive position where Ray is not that good. And even if Doug is getting in the position he wants, Daniel is still very, very good in this defensive position and he can stay there for long. And I think even if,
Jānis Amolins: that gets in this offensive position, he will struggle to finish the fight. Can I ask you something? Do you think that Daniel is really strong in defensive position? Whenever I said defensive, he uses his pronator in like from middle to the losing side here in a defensive way. But whenever he's going inside or shoulder pressure, it is
Jānis Amolins: Like I don't see him really here. He is usually here. Like he's, when you say like defensive, his arm is not open and some people can hold here. He's not like that. He's really forcing the match from center to this way. And then if you call this defensive, to me, like it's not that clear if it is really defensive.
Jānis Amolins: Okay, I would say differently. I would say that he can be very good in this open angle position that when he's still very, very open and he can still pull from that position very good. Yeah, he does that open position if he's pulling outside with Kornet. If he's going to go inside, he's not really open like this, but he is more like in fact, you know. And if Daniel will not feel very good in the setup,
Jānis Amolins: biggest like most like biggest chance i see that he can go for for a strap intentionally and in a strap oh it's gonna go there anyways i don't yeah yeah yeah for sure uh yeah and in this trap it's easy to you know go strap because as long as you don't foul like any sleep is uh the step because yeah
Jānis Amolins: And then the question is, question is how, how, how strong can, uh, can, uh, Doug, Doug be, and then, and then how much better he can be from previous fight because, uh, he, he should be much better to, to do something. 15, 20% as people say that it's not possible. It is not possible if you are already picked, but if you are coming back to.
Jānis Amolins: like your best from like, for example, for me, as of now, it's possible to get even 20, 25% stronger because I'm not like even close. Right now, I can hardly do pull up, but I am sure that three months later, I will be hanging 30 kilo and maybe doing with two hands, you know? So this is what he's saying, that he was not at his best against Raimonds. This is what he says. We will see.
Jānis Amolins: How much, when it was? It's like two months? What it was? Three months? I mean, between those two events is three and a half months. Exactly three and a half months, yeah. It is good time, but still for...
Jānis Amolins: if we talk about natural athletes that strength gap difference from for for and jumps for uh 20 30 or 50 percent what we are talking is all impossible it's like for for natural athletes we are talking about maybe five ten percent difference natural athletes again you know if they are at their best to increase it doesn't matter it doesn't matter you are out of shape no no no me me
Jānis Amolins: I can say about my experience, I can say about my athletes' experience, like weight, they can show when they are out of shape and not training for a month, and they can still do some exercise. Three years, four years break, and six months break are different, especially age also matters. Age also matters, you know. When you are 20 years old, young kid, you know, you are, I mean, strong, all the time strong, but
Bozhidar Simeonov: And how do you see Bozidar this match? I think like if Doug wants to beat Daniel first, he has to overtrain him. You know, like this guy is really hard working, like both of the guys are. But Daniel, he's like a maniac, you know, like every time I meet him, he has some new muscles on the hand and all this stuff, you know, so he improves day by day.
Bozhidar Simeonov: arm wrestles more and all this stuff but i think that uh in the first rounds like his overconfidence might play him a bad game you know so he might come to the table a little bit overconfident about the match and he might uh end up losing the hand first rounds but we'll see like i think he will go for the top row like first round i have a question for you guys when you guys saw
Jānis Amolins: I've seen Vladislav stop rolling Samushia really like easy and I think Yanis took his hand as well like he has really big
Jānis Amolins: hand Samushia but I think like his wrist is not like that that strong I said that after round one beat him because he he waited he didn't really dominate right away he exhausted him in the same rounds and then in him did you guys think that you know like Daniel was gonna win that because later rounds we saw that Daniel was the one who got exhausted
Jānis Amolins: If you look, I think if you look closely, you could see that Samushia didn't really like, he almost kind of felt like he's not in a comfortable spot and he just gave it away in this first round. Um, which to me, I was, so I said, okay, um, I didn't think that Daniel was for sure winning. I thought, okay, it's getting interesting, but it did look like Samushia kind of, um,
Jānis Amolins: When we talk about Daniel and his great endurance, we have to understand that he's great with endurance in his style, his pulling. And right now, what we saw against Samushia, he was going for top roll, but he's not doing too often. And I believe in top roll, it's not... Did you see round four when he tried to go inside? Yeah, but his angle was gone, his back pressure was gone. And still, to get in that position, you need that back pressure as well.
Jānis Amolins: so uh i believe he was just pulling in in a style which is not really really uh common for him and then he's not pulling always like that so uh probably i don't think that if you are bringing your shoulder and diving in i don't think you need back pressure at least i mean you can even do down pressure with the tricep and supination and you can go that way i don't think he needed back pressure to start there but he just couldn't stop and
Jānis Amolins: His outside muscles were tired, but the inside was fresh. Maybe he was slow. Maybe he was slow, I don't know.
Jānis Amolins: I don't know how he got... It's similar like when Hadji was pulling Hutchings. Hadji was going outside, outside, and after that when he tries inside, it seems like you are still fresh inside, but you also are not able to pull in other style as well. So, yeah, maybe you're right, but I believe that if he would go fresh from fresh... I think it would be Zolaev inside anyways, in my opinion. Combining the styles is really exhausting.
Bozhidar Simeonov: during a super match, especially like if you're top rolling and then trying to hook, it's not a really good idea. And especially against a guy like Samushia, because his endurance, it's really big time as well. Like after our first round, my arm was exploding and I thought, okay, like my arm is exploding, but how his hand should be like, and I thought he's even more exhausted.
Jānis Amolins: than me but it was the other way is that is that is it through the second round you also pin him what was it called i don't know like if wasn't called it might be for how did you feel that way did you feel did you feel that way that did you feel like you've been him or
Bozhidar Simeonov: I have like mixed feelings. Devon't get me wrong, even if you got the second round. I have mixed feelings about this round because you can't be sure about the angle of the camera and everything, you know. I told you I'm 50-50 about this. I can't say for sure. I can't say. But you are saying that it could be. Yeah, I'm with mixed feelings. The question, if it was 2-0,
Bozhidar Simeonov: you think you would win the third or he would come back for three two not sure maybe no no he might the match might ended up like three two even if it was two so you were getting exhausted you were getting exhausted yeah like third round like i had nothing to give him anymore i understand so let's go to the next one rob vision
Jānis Amolins: seems like rob is maybe looking a bit more motivated these days so maybe yeah i think that team team format all together all those northeast uh region pauline and jerry is there you know like i think they are really motivating each other over there
Jānis Amolins: Yeah, it somehow feels like we are a lot more motivated than the east side. I don't know why, but maybe we have more to prove. You are divided. It's not east versus west. It is U.S. versus world, you know, sometimes with exception of Canada and Brazil. But it's basically U.S. versus world, like Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Georgii and other countries, you know. Yeah. And that's why they are.
Jānis Amolins: against like but also you know we somehow we are always trying to say that um europe is at the moment stronger than us or something like that and i'm sure we are um they don't like this so they they have a lot to prove they want to make us wrong so and you know it gives them strength i would say like i could feel justin bishop being very motivated and so on so
Jānis Amolins: yeah that's good but this trust me it's not because i am organizing but this is really a global level reality check east versus west and it's good that finally all the best guys are did you guys see the list that i posted the guys that pull in some events already you know yeah yeah it's a good list you know like i'm not like being prideful or something i'm just happy that that all these guys on the same stage
Jānis Amolins: know it's just a dream of ours you know like i know you you three also have the same dreams you know to see all these guys that we are sick with that we are divided for decades you know yeah and janice how do you see this one versus uh rap zurab looked really good in a in a in a chechnya in a in a russian event when it was two weeks ago
Jānis Amolins: Zuro looked really good and it seems he's one who is getting better and better. I don't know how long it can last, but he's in a good trajectory and going up.
Jānis Amolins: I haven't heard much from Rob since the last time he pulled against Sasho. Has he pulled much after that? After UNWARS when he lost against Sasho? No, I don't think so. So I don't know. I don't know. But definitely Rob has strength and experience and style to pull against Zurab.
Jānis Amolins: He could pull similarly like Chancho did. He can do similar move. Is he in good shape? Is he ready? I don't know. I have no any proof from that. But definitely that long forearm, big hand could help for him to take Zurab's hand. But even if you take Zurab's hand, it could be not enough.
Bozhidar Simeonov: As we know, when we... Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, but we'll see. We'll see. And you, Oswald? I don't, like, like, if I make it like a list, you know, like, mindset, Zurab is stronger, like, but I think the match will end up with the wrist, for sure. For Zurab? You think he's going to top roll? Yeah, yeah.
Jānis Amolins: So you are saying that... If he goes in hook against Zurab, there is no chance for Rob Dijon. No, what I'm just saying is that you think that Sasho's wrist and hook inability is better than Zurab's? 100%, yeah. So that's why there may be a way for Rob to... Yes, exactly. I understand. But even at Arm Wars, Rob seemed a little bit insecure. He even felt...
Bozhidar Simeonov: underprepared I don't know what's happening with him but right now I hope he's prepared and no space for excuses and they will just make a good match you know because his genetic genetics is really good and his skills are good enough to beat Zurab but does he have one depends on how he's gonna use what he has yes exactly is he smart enough to finish the match we will see at the event
Jānis Amolins: but i'm 80 sure he will take the hint rob is known to have a very high iq so what's that no rob vision is known to have a very high iq yeah maybe he will use it and make sure that he's ready how about alicia murado kodi mindogas
Jānis Amolins: 5-0 Alizhan Muratov. You want to bet again? You want to bet? Yeah. How much? 1,000 euros. But now we promise if it doesn't happen, that score, I will take your money. Wait a second, repeat again. Right now we promise each other.
Jānis Amolins: And if that score doesn't happen, I take your money. Best of five. Devon't forget this score. Elbow fouls and bullshit like that. Oh, come on. Come on. You just said that. You just said that. Are you saying that Kody wins? The match can't be 5-0. Yeah, because best of five. It can be the best. It can be 3-0. I'm saying... Okay. I'm just saying Alizhan is going to win. That's my thing. So if you want to bet on 5-0, okay. Okay.
Jānis Amolins: Okay, that's just easy. Janis, how do you see this one? It will be hard for Kody to beat Aljan. Maybe again more chance in the first round or first two, but longer fight goes, less chance for Kody for sure. And Aljan is very tricky. It's very tricky. It's hard to find a way how to beat him.
Jānis Amolins: Do you think that maybe Kody's back pressure too much for his wrist whenever he wants to go? Do you think there is any possibility? No, there are possibility. Of course there are. But maybe for Iran first, Kody could do something or maybe take that hand. But still, I believe
Jānis Amolins: late like in late rounds it's uh alijan is is super endurable and uh it's it's very hard to pin him and he can pull in this uh in this sometimes even awkward position and uh i i i don't i don't see that uh cody can pull in in in such a style against him that's just what i think but uh i really like cody and uh i i i want to see him uh get him like some success in this fight but
Jānis Amolins: It's very hard. I don't see it like that. I see that Alizhan is clear favorite in my eyes. Before Bojidar answers, were you guys surprised by the performance of Alizhan against Petrenko? I'm not talking about only winning, but him being so explosive.
Jānis Amolins: and switching from position to position he going this way and then suddenly open arm top roll suddenly to shoulder pressure and then at the end exhausting someone like that someone like petrenko like were you guys surprised him being such a explosive guy and having such endurance at the same time not not many people has uh that like also ongar bayer is like incredibly explosive
Jānis Amolins: and can pull forever. It just reminds me also of Kaczewski. He could just hit you like a lightning and he could pull like three minutes. Were you guys surprised by his performance? Not really.
Jānis Amolins: We were watching a live stream and betting money and actually I think in that fight I bet with Antonovic Raimon that Aljan will win. So we get our own bets. But also I think that it's what we are comparing with. Petrenko is a super strong armwrestler, but I don't see him as a good supermatch armwrestler. I don't think he's a great supermatch fight specialist.
Jānis Amolins: It's always a question of how good you look when you compare with someone. So maybe we can be wrong and Aljan will not look so great in some other fights. That's also, we are talking about Doug Elridge, but what we can compare Doug is with Ray. And if I have to say true that I don't think that Ray was in a good shape that weekend. Ray was pulling, I don't know how many, 16 or 18 super matches last year.
Jānis Amolins: And I can say he's always in good shape, but it's still, it's too much. And he was not in a good shape that weekend for sure. So how to compare someone when we don't know much about that? I was more impressed by Petrenko this match. I didn't expect him to stop Alizhan or to give him such a hard time, you know.
Bozhidar Simeonov: you're talking about someone in 2019 he beat dadikyan yeah yeah yeah but and now he was 105 kilo 10 kilo heavier than alijan okay but there was there is also a really big difference between dadikyan from that year and now because 2018 or uh tzonev beat dadikyan as well i think yeah but he pulled
Jānis Amolins: two classes i think he pulled a class class with morozo and tobias and he won there and then he pulled i think the seniors after that yeah and just because before i thought like petrenko had really big difference between left and right hand and now it might be just like the same both hands like straight you are you are saying that you were expecting alijan to dominate petrenko
Bozhidar Simeonov: and the match was so close yeah you were amazed by petrenko yes exactly yeah it just means that you you rank alijan super highly yeah yeah because i've pulled him like even 2018 like i've prepared so bad and the guy just didn't feel me we were in the same weight class and now he rocked the heavyweight he lost only to gapchenko at the world and it was big
Jānis Amolins: inside hook match. He had the control. He was holding. He just couldn't finish it. I always have really high expectations of Ali Can. Can we say that Ali Can is the best pound for pound, right and left or no? Right hand, no.
Jānis Amolins: no no no no no when i say i'm talking about his right if we can compare everyone's right with left you understand like the dominance is that anyone at 95 kilo for example right arm could do the things that alijan does against the heavier guys not really no like he always dominated his weight class always
Jānis Amolins: Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe Daniel Prokopchuk, his left for 75 kilo. Maybe, yeah. I will not say anything. I will leave Yannis Mindaugas here about Daniel. Yeah, and maybe, maybe 70 kilo Cherkasov, right arm, maybe. Or 70. When he's 75 kilo, the things are dramatically changing. Ah, 70 kilo Cherkasov, I don't know, after I saw him pulling against Mindaugas in Moldova.
Jānis Amolins: um i mean nervous he tried to hook you there right like if he tried to topple you do you think the things could be changed or i don't think he could do that back when maybe he was not that he was not really able to talk about back then i don't think so yeah you were to see him would be a good match huh at the east versus west yeah i would really enjoy this because i feel like it's a good match for me i don't think yes seems like he's
Bozhidar Simeonov: is somehow very simple just power puller somehow i always manage outside inside it can pull different ideas and why he always tries to hook top rollers without the strap right is that if he can't do both why he's always trying i i just can't explain to myself every time let's just ask john why he tried to
Jānis Amolins: hook arsene lillier without the strip when he knows that every time he goes he was just stopping him and beating him you know but he was just like he did the same thing against dima coach here he was every time he tried to hook dima just dragged him and then he was three two in the sixth round even on the sixth round he tried to do the same thing but this time he hooked him he was just like he doesn't care about winning he if he wants to do something
Jānis Amolins: He cares more about what he wants than winning the match. He's like, no, I'm going to beat this guy in that way. Just come on, John. Just beat the guy officially. Just ask him to come to the side table. But no, he wants that to happen officially. You know, the guy is so idealistic. It is impossible not to be amazed by John. And let's go to Adam Wozniacki, Bacho Bacho Saginashvili. This is a big question mark for me. I don't know how you guys see it.
Jānis Amolins: can start we're already because of your last podcast is the question mark since last post podcast with adam and bacho yeah yeah because i don't know the guy i only saw him 14 years old at the side table at the walk he was beating everyone you know the seniors and he never left the table niazi came to me he's like look at that guy you know 14 years old guy look what he's doing at the side table
Jānis Amolins: And like, and then whenever I think that this guy is now 18 years old, you know, just like, I'm not talking about from 24 to 28, I'm talking about 14 to 18, you know, it's just, you know. So is there any possibility someone, we can say that never get out of Georgii except U15 competition, which doesn't mean something big. Do you think he can just come to the East versus West stage and beat someone like Adam who beat Bojidar?
Jānis Amolins: Okay, I let you guys continue. Who starts? Yeah, if you are from Georgii, then yes. But Giannis, this guy is training partners. He's not any of those guys that we know. They don't pull. He lives somewhere else. And if he was training with those guys, this guy has different coach, different training partners. He's not with those Iraqis, Zurab, you know,
Jānis Amolins: Levan or other guys. The guy is totally isolated from those guys. That's another interesting part. Go ahead. I just wanted to inform you before you continue. Similarly, like you, I don't know much about Bacho. It's impossible to have some history of fights. I even don't know if he has competed in some Georgii local competition. I don't know.
Jānis Amolins: But he seems strong, but that's it. That's it. Like I said, if you are one of the best in Georgii, if you're one of the best in Russia, if you're one of the best in Bulgaria, in countries where armistice league is in a super high level, that seems something. And guys who can win in that local event or local level can be very, very strong and dangerous.
Jānis Amolins: absolutely could be favorite in any fight internationally as well. I understand, yeah. There is one guy, it's Talwud Granpan, Engin, don't do in Ramadan. How did you come to that conclusion, my friend? It is eight o'clock here and it started like 20 minutes ago. Just please, like you put like five question marks, but I can't stop myself. Just shut the fuck up. Go ahead. Go ahead, Rindagato.
Jānis Amolins: yeah he's just also i would like this dick you know just yeah go ahead no i would just maybe say that um yeah it's hard to predict the results we don't know about you at all um but um yeah but i wonder how how did you come up with such a such a match because um yeah uh i remember this match i will tell them like either
Jānis Amolins: will never trust your world again or i will just say wow you guys were right we will stick the thing is that adam borjinski is now quite an interesting figure i would say we saw what he did to borjedar so i was almost i was hoping that maybe we can have another well-known name um in front of adam
Jānis Amolins: so we could see even more about what's up but now yeah it's a bit uh it's gonna be strange because uh we even either way no matter who wins it's we still don't really know how strong is bacho how strong is yeah i guess it's bacho wins when bacho is very strong but if adam wins when we don't really know nothing was you know more clear you're talking about about
Jānis Amolins: Adam? Yeah, if Adam wins, we don't know about... Sorry? If Adam wins, we don't know about Adam or we don't know about Baccio? Yeah, we don't really know any... We know about Adam, but we know he won against Borgia, right? But if he wins against Baccio now, we don't really know how good is Baccio, so... No, I think we all have an idea. I think the way he beats him,
Jānis Amolins: If he has war with that, that 18-year-old kid will impress me. But if Adam dominates him, just looks at his face and stumbles him, you know, just like this, then we will just say that this guy needs more time, you know, not anytime soon, you know. And you, Bozidar? Well, I've seen Bacho pulling only against Samushia's left hand. And I don't know how
Jānis Amolins: strong is his right hand they say it's close to zura stuff you know but practice is practice competition is completely different story so i'm going 100 with adam and this would it would hurt your honor right yeah 18 years old kid this guy to beat you right yeah i'll be happy for the kid if he wins
Jānis Amolins: Yeah, I mean, we will have a new superstar. It will be interesting, right? If you can really do something to Adam, it will be really impressive. Yeah, yeah. And let's go to Arif versus Dzeranov. Anyone who uses mind, just ready to answer?
Bozhidar Simeonov: can start I'm not asking you know like this guy or that guy well if uh the run of his top rolling if he stopped rolling I'm see him after a hard fight as a winner but if he tries to cook or if he might lose pretty easy that's what I think I understand yeah that's my point of view like
Bozhidar Simeonov: If he goes outside, will he win by endurance factor or there is a possibility even in a fresh match he may be better than Arif? Not easy, but I think he will take the hand of Arif if they both go top row. Because I've seen until the last supermatch of Dzeranov
Bozhidar Simeonov: I didn't see him pulling in hook, you know? Yeah, he tried to topple and Kalinichenko easily toppled. But back in the days, he was dominating with his top row, Dzeranov. So I see his chances if he top rows, but still, if he top rows, it's still 50-50 defensive. His hand will endure against Arif's.
Jānis Amolins: Because what's the weight difference right now between Arif and Dzeranov? Arif is about 150 and Dzeranov probably 125, if not a little bit more. So that's my point of view. He tries hooking Arif, he has no chance. Maybe later rounds, if endurance factor somehow plays role. In a fresh match, it is not that easy. You just jump there, he can...
Jānis Amolins: He can hit you like lightning. Arif is a really explosive guy. Any others? Ask me about lightweights, I don't know. Middleweights, maybe. Who cares about that? This is how they treat us, right? Not me, I'm middleweight right now. Oh, you damn lightweights, man. Yeah, exactly.
Jānis Amolins: They are both great to watch, especially Giorano in a supermatch and Arif as well. It could be a really exciting fight. They can make a good fight, but if you have said them both, you know more than us probably about Arif Shaif, so you see that it could be a great fight. And absolutely, they both are good armwrestlers.
Jānis Amolins: I'm looking forward, but that's it. Sometimes I set the matches because I have to as well. You know, like, for example, the Serena won right and left against Wagner and Sergei Kalnyshenko, and I didn't invite him to the following one. So the guy is winning right and left, and you're not inviting him, then why is he winning, you understand?
Jānis Amolins: So then sometimes I have to set some matches. Not that because I just go think that what would be a good match, but I also need to choose from the previous winners. There will be a time that I will set a match that will look like complete mismatch as well. Like, I don't know, maybe a title match that had to happen. If the guy, like for example, under 115 kg,
Jānis Amolins: except if he gains weight any match looks i don't know if you agree or not but mismatch for them you disagree against devon no except if ongar wave gains weight if he is over 110 kilo then i think it's gonna be a good match but other than that like any match for devon under 115 kg looks
Jānis Amolins: Yes. I don't know. Maybe you guys think different. Maybe there is some guy that I don't know that could give hell to Devon. But even a super heavyweight now, Genadi, we will see what will happen. We will come there anyways. Yeah, and Mindaugas, obviously, Arif and Dzeranov. I would probably guess that Dzeranov wins. But yeah, I'm not going into technical details. Just, yeah. Yeah, I understand.
Jānis Amolins: and let's go to brandon elsa sor versus samusha i will be asking to anyone who is ready what's the weight of brandon uh it will be most likely 85 at the weigh-in but probably he will be near 95 at the competition time these guys like pauline and a few others they really know how to cut weight you know
Jānis Amolins: they just don't care too much about their health that's a difference they want it they want those fights too much and yeah do you think is it very dangerous to do that water cuts it's not about dangerous but uh it's it's uh not healthy for sure it's it's like uh we we can't talk about uh that being healthy for your for for your uh
Jānis Amolins: or for your organ systems. That's true. Dangerous? There are some dangers, of course. There are some dangers. Anything that is unhealthy is dangerous to me. We have seen in many fight sports, also in arm wrestling, when guys are not able to cut the weight. Also in MMA, in boxing, we have seen that guys are taken to hospital because of cutting too much weight. Of course, it's dangerous, but dangerous.
Jānis Amolins: Guys, time to time, I little bit drink because I fasted 16 hours. And then while we are chatting at the 40th minutes, it started to time, you know, so I just need to explain, you know, you know, so that
Jānis Amolins: Yeah, but if you ask about Brandon, he's very dangerous. It's not easy to hook him and if they can stay somewhere with flat wrist or maybe in that center position, it could be very interesting.
Jānis Amolins: I'm not sure if Brandon can give Samushia a good fight inside. That's the question. Because if Davit is getting inside with Brandon, I think it could be over maybe. But if that fight can stay outside, if that fight can stay somewhere in the center, both with flat hand, this could be very interesting. Brandon also looks like he has good endurance.
Jānis Amolins: I was very surprised when Craig couldn't hook him, you know, when he does that fast forward, you know, move, but he still couldn't hook him. So if Samushia is going there, if somehow, you know, Brandon hangs him here, then I don't know. Then it could be a very good fight, but that's the question. But I think if Samushia will get inside...
Jānis Amolins: then it could be over quite fast. Is there anyone who can beat Samushia inside at 85 kilos? Bozidar did one round, but... Who could? I don't know who else. If Hamza would be in super shape, maybe. Sasho could be 85. Oh, yeah? Maybe right now, I don't know. Can I ask you something? He can cut to 85. Oh...
Jānis Amolins: should we should set him against the winner and uh vlad in good shape could could be dangerous yeah until now 85 kilo he didn't prove a lot 80 kilo he did well but 85 i don't know he pulled only one year old 85 yeah yeah
Jānis Amolins: And how do you guys see Mindaugas, Brandon? Isn't Brandon better on his left? I think both arms is doing well. And so Brandon, was Brandon the guy who beat Travis on the left? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the right arm, he beat Craig Tudor right before Amos Dragoste's Craig match.
Jānis Amolins: okay so yeah maybe there's some hope maybe there's some hope for brandon but yeah i would assume that samusha will handle brandon maybe his cupping will be enough maybe it'll end up in a hoop can i ask you a question would you rather pull bojidar or samusha bojidar really don't you think that his hook inability is more dangerous
Jānis Amolins: Samushia is maybe not so skillful, like he doesn't really do that as much, but his cupping is crazy strong. So I think... Now I feel abused. See, one round... I would be more afraid of Samushia. One round, Daniel was able to block him and beat him. And another round, he even top-rolled him. Samushia was pulling that way. Do you think that Daniel can top-roll Bozidarz?
Jānis Amolins: hmm yeah good question good point good point that's why i'm oh that's why i mean just make it happen and we will see make it happen i just remember samusha from the old days when he got number three and at zloty tour and i remember i was testing him in those days and he was crazy his cutting was just brutal and he was he was only 78 kilo there yeah so
Jānis Amolins: I just remember. So you wouldn't want to pull against him, huh? For sure. I wouldn't want to pull that Samushia from like a couple of years ago, but maybe now something is versus not as good. I don't know, but I would assume that it's, it's as good as always. I don't know. I don't think that he is any less. That one was overalls, you know, overalls sometimes in, you know, give us some like misleading results. Right. Yeah.
Bozhidar Simeonov: Let's go to another one. Oh, Brandon, you didn't say Bozo, your opinion. I agree 100% with what Yanis said. He explained it perfectly. But I'm rooting for Samushia 100%. I don't know really well Brandon. I haven't seen much of him, but I don't want to repeat what Yanis said. So let's go to the last matches.
Jānis Amolins: Pauline versus Sasho. I would like to hear from Yanis first, because I'm curious about how he pictures Pauline on his mind. Do you see him dangerous? He's dangerous. We saw him against Rustam, and it's
Jānis Amolins: it's not not only injuries happen because uh of course injuries happens but uh but also because uh paul paul was able to put uh rustam in not in good position but but similarly like i said uh before when when paul was pulling rustam i think that uh sasho is favorite and uh sasho is very capable of getting inside in his position and uh when when sasho in that in that position i don't think
Jānis Amolins: much can happen from that. And it's not easy to take Sasho's hand. It's not easy. He didn't. He was not. Paul wasn't effective when he tried outside against Rustam. What he did to Rustam was inside. So I am not expecting Paul to attack where you are now trying to say how strong Sasho is. If anyone, not Paul, anyone is going there.
Jānis Amolins: They are in trouble. You're trying to go out like this, you are in trouble against Sasho. You wouldn't want to go there. But where Paul is going, Paul tried to top roll John. John toyed with him. But when Paul went inside with John, I asked John, did you allow him to hook you or? No, he said, no, he hooked me. He was very explosive. And after that match, it was a war. John's forearm was injured. His pronator muscle, it was a grab. And then I saw him against Rambert.
Jānis Amolins: He tried to topple Rambet. He lost badly. And then he three times hook and easily beat Rambet. So my expectation is him to go totally inside over Sasho's cronator as Zolev did at the 2019 love final. So I think this is where he's going to go, my opinion. So if that's the case, what's your opinion? Every time I predict...
Jānis Amolins: I'm choosing Paul as an underdog and saying that he will lose. I don't know, I may be wrong, but again, I believe that Sasho will win this one. Because in all previous fights, when Paul was pulling with Samushia, when Paul was pulling with Rustam, okay, Rustam, it was injury, but still.
Jānis Amolins: I don't see that Paul will beat Sasho inside. It could be a close fight. It could be a close fight he can get, but Sasho is good. Sasho is good in that position where Paul is attacking, and that's the thing. Stylistically, I believe Sasho is not a good opponent for him, or not an easy opponent for him.
Jānis Amolins: Good, but not easy. Sasho is not easy opponent for anybody. Yeah, true. Yeah, especially if you are top roller. I mean, like for me, there may be many guys that I cannot beat under 95. But last guy that I would want to pull would be Sasho. Imagine this, like you're holding a dumbbell, you know? Yeah.
Jānis Amolins: and someone jumping on it. Yeah, this is the feeling when he's attacking you. Yeah, that is why somebody, like people who put pressure, super pressure over his grenade, those are the ones that were able to have those FUVs, Kocak, Zolev, Patachins, you know, like to put, because like he can be supinated,
Jānis Amolins: He can still hit so much if you are only attacking his hand. But if he is supinated, also having so much pressure on his pronators, then like if you want to beat him, you need to put more pressure on his pronators than he puts on your pronators. Once he is in an offensive position. Yeah, it's done. All he has to do is to commit completely. And every time Sasho attacks, he has to just to...
Bozhidar Simeonov: to hold and to put more and more pressure, you know, just to curl more and more his hand and not from here. And he has to be, the match has to stop for Paul here, you know. And if he wants to win, Sasho has to start attacking from this position if Paul has chance. What I think that instead of trying to get his hand or something, his power is coming from his incredible offense.
Jānis Amolins: So to be able to apply that offense, he needs to protect this angle so he can hit. So that is why you need to pull him, like turn him totally palm up and not only with wrist, you also need to put some pressure. Then whenever he tries to hit you, if you cut this connection, then it's possible. Not many people can do. Zolaev did, Kocak did.
Jānis Amolins: I don't know if they can do right now, but I don't know. I think he versus Zurab would be a good match as well. What do you guys think? It will be a crazy hook war. After I saw Zurab against Sergi Bogoslov, Sago, I know he's going outside, but whenever those guys are incredibly strong inside pullers,
Jānis Amolins: had some problem with the how do you say his name yeah yeah he he was a little bit challenged but against sago he just i don't know he just i i was not expecting that i was thinking when ibrahim sago hit biceps if drop's bicep could hold or not but there was nothing you know just he was
Jānis Amolins: too easy but but he also told me Ibrahim said that he's going down from near 100 304 kilo to 95 maybe because if you realize he's a really big guy you know old guy yeah and and how do you see bozo do you see any chance uh from both sides if he goes with the top roll like he has to commit for the hook you know like yeah
Bozhidar Simeonov: has to fully commit to this site and uh like trying to isolate sasha's hand it's not impossible but it's really really hard task like it's like mission impossible for paul so have you been close at any training with right arm to special
Jānis Amolins: I haven't pulled with him maybe more than... I'm talking about all those years of training, just say three years. Dave you been, I know that with left arm or right arm, you said that a few times you felt like close, but I don't know which arm was. Well, at some points we've been close, but like he catch up really, really fast. I can tell you this, like we might be close and after two weeks, the gap might be like, boom.
Bozhidar Simeonov: like when this guy gets serious like his his levels are going like this so but yes like and the only chance it's when i hit first and like i told you like over pronate him like really really good in the hook with full shoulder commitment and staying there and like just holding to every of his hits and while holding trying to
Jānis Amolins: like he hits and I go more up, you know, just to isolate his hand. Otherwise, like it's impossible to beat him. Yeah. And I mean, that was. Yeah. I'm just trying to think about, uh, what we saw the, um, um, right. Um, and, uh, and Paul, um,
Jānis Amolins: I don't think, yeah, Paul was probably, Babaya was not good for Paul. Maybe that's why it didn't look good. Of course, the injury happened and so on. But I'm thinking that maybe Paul could actually be technically maybe quite okay against Sasho. Just because Sasho is not going to be as fast. So, Paul then has a...
Jānis Amolins: bit more time and pauline is quite good at dragging everything to his side where sasha i don't feel like he's that good in these defensive positions he's just not so tall he prefers offense a lot so if pauline can just apply that kind of just you know his whole body he can fall sideways and open sasha up a little bit initially maybe that could be good enough
Jānis Amolins: So that's the only lane I can see where Pauline gets something done. Otherwise, yeah. I mean, if Sasho catches you in his offensive position, it is probably over. Yeah. If you want to beat Sasho, you need to bring him to his losing side. But I will tell you something. Pauline is probably one of the most explosive guys on this tour. Trust me. His start is really incredible.
Bozhidar Simeonov: that they're forcing that the hook move is really good and so i'm saying that maybe he has a chance to bring yeah yeah yeah yeah but rustam and sasha's uh hooks are two completely different styles yeah yeah yeah so it depends like sasha has side press big time as well and believe me he will not let even a single millimeter off to the center of the hand of anything
Jānis Amolins: so we'll see it probably depends on how strong the opponent is you know yeah yeah i mean if they ask him will you let he would probably say no i know that but sometimes okay let's go versus tobias it's left arm yes yeah um
Jānis Amolins: Sorry, guys, let me just run for a bit. I have something urgent. But thank you a lot for the call. You're leaving? I'm leaving. I have to go. Okay, just give one second. Who's winning, Devon or Genadi? You're going to say Devon, I'm sure. Devon, easily. Easily? Easily. Even though he doesn't know about our message as much as you do? Even if that's the case. This is now big, Devon. Different animal. Yeah.
Jānis Amolins: okay take care we have like three matches and we also finish here okay who's winning janice it's it's uh fight for hand it's uh but uh like always uh vitaly is great but uh with some very good top rollers he he could struggle and uh they will both have this size and height and then hand position
Jānis Amolins: And it's interesting, Tobias is surprising everyone, I believe, more and more in the last fights we have seen him. But still, I think Vitalii is his favorite. Especially after we saw that he's back in good shape in events in Russia. Can I ask you something?
Jānis Amolins: you are thinking he's more experienced and strong. But whenever you look at it stylistically, the low-end couple with the... That's what I'm saying. The only problem is that when we see that Vitalii is struggling against someone, he's sometimes struggling against good top-rollers. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's a thing that could happen, but it's all about who will take that home control.
Jānis Amolins: the one who will take will win and we don't know but uh but what i saw that vitale is in very good shape in uh two weeks ago in russia so in in a good shape vitale so you are saying it's wrong time to pull vitale i'll be back in 20 seconds i don't know it's a it's a it's it's just uh that uh it's it's it's i i believe there are not too too many armistice in the world who can beat uh
Jānis Amolins: very good shape Vitalii. That's the thing. If Tobias will do that, that's very impressive. Yeah, you realize that these are the two of the strongest grip guys in the community. Yeah, absolutely. That fight should happen and Tobias deserves it. He deserves it. He's pulling very good and I want to see that fight and I want to see really how good Tobias is and can he do something against Vitalii. But I see, of course, Vitalii as a favorite.
Jānis Amolins: but not not not so one-sided no no no no so you are saying that even if it is 30 he still has the chance yeah yeah yeah yeah and there is a separate first time thank you my friend thank you i will do my best for my dream thank you engen he's coming for the qualification event and thank you my friend and and how do you see it uh whenever morozov tried to top roll uh
Jānis Amolins: yeah he he lost his wrist like nothing you know just obvious easily took his wrist and because he attacked to his hand then he beat him with supinated side pressure following rounds but now laletin is attacking to his hand where morozov couldn't so do you think any chance for tobias or laletin is too experienced too strong too big there is a chance for uh
Bozhidar Simeonov: obvious but like if his hand endurance doesn't go fully stretched you know like and yeah if he can do the side hit he might win like but with this low hand top row if your hand goes there won't be a chance against quality but if he has endurance
Jānis Amolins: he can hit him sideways, there might be a chance, like something like mid-point. Bojula, Laletin is the one that is using usually low-hand couple. I don't think Tobias is doing this. Tobias is like normal, like high knuckle couple as far as I know. I think it's opposite. Am I wrong, Yanis? Laletin is usually... Mostly, yeah, yeah, yeah. Tobias is more like a vertical drop-toe, but...
Jānis Amolins: Yeah, so the opposite. Yeah, yeah. So then now you say Tobias is going to win? So Tobias will be controlling the hand while he has to hit his side. Exactly. Yeah, but the problem is the low hand topple is usually not this advantage for someone who is too middle. Yeah, but he has really high leverage, so it's really comfortable. Yeah, yeah.
Jānis Amolins: just i will just get the charger i asked the question and janice you start i will quickly in one second i will get charger uh revas versus cheffy janice yeah we will talk with bosnia about lightweights better and i don't i don't really understand you top rollers exactly that's the thing and again question about those heavyweights yeah yeah
Jānis Amolins: Zvetan went to Russia and Krassi went to Russia, yes? Yeah, both ended up at fifth place. Yeah, but they both did good. They both had some great fights. And Zvetan against Zaluyo was a fantastic fight. And against this guy with the long hair. I liked that. How many minutes was it?
Jānis Amolins: i i got old like i was like it's like a nightmare you know if i would see that in my dream i would just say oh please finish it's what kind of nightmares like like what the five minutes ten minutes how long was it yeah but i liked how when he was re-gripping he was re-gripping and his hair as well you know no but he was pulling very good he was pulling good
Jānis Amolins: against Zlatan, it's not easy at all. But also Zaluya when Zlatan was good and I saw that look in Haji's face and he feels like he's in trouble. He feels like, okay, I can hold it, but I'm in trouble that Zlatan will come back and will win. He feels it. It's crazy. Those were great fights, great fights. I love you guys with Dave Chaffee versus Rawaz and look what I'm talking about.
Jānis Amolins: Yeah, we are talking about that. Yeah. Who cares? Who cares about the big fat asses, right? To talk about lightweights, lightweight rugs. Seriously, let's let's talk about Revaz versus Dave. How do you expect? I think I think Dave's hand could be a little bit too much for Revaz. And and I think that Dave could top roll Revaz.
Jānis Amolins: like Georgii always saying that Rebos can be best of all Georgii and that he could be stronger than any of them and that potential is huge so he could be stronger and stronger but
Jānis Amolins: lately what what i see from dave he's very good against uh against uh uh very good with with top roll himself and i say that he could top roll ravers and i think is that ravers could struggle to get in some good position to get in a fight and you bush what uh did ravas say what percentage he will be against dave oh he said he he will be at his best ever yeah is it true i mean so far
Bozhidar Simeonov: And what percentage he was against Morozov? 80. Yeah, 20% is too much for armwrestling. Yeah, but I'm going with Dave. I don't believe that Rivas is stronger than Laletin right now. And I think that Chaffee will... Maybe first rounds we will see a great fight, but I still think that Dave has too much sight.
Jānis Amolins: Okay, last two matches, Irakli vs. Ongar Bayev. That's a good one. That fight I'm looking forward to. We can call Irakli health lightweight. He just left us, right?
Jānis Amolins: hunger bio was not uh like hunger bio was pulling 90 kilos yes uh yeah i think even 85 kilo or maybe 85 even 85 i think in malaysia it was 85 85 years he pulled with plumbing on the center by now yeah so both are like almost like okay lightweight with middleweights that's better that's better now we can they both went to the dark side
Jānis Amolins: I don't know about Ongar Baio. He was pulling in a WAF not so long time ago. He was pulling in a WAF two years ago. Ongar Baio? Yeah. Only three, four months. No, five months ago. No, no. In a WAF when he was pulling. Five months ago. He did? Yeah. Ongar Baio 100 kilo left turn.
Jānis Amolins: okay yeah yeah so so right now he got put poison or something he couldn't pull right on yeah yeah he catch cold or something you know true true true true yeah yeah true in a in a previous mouth yeah he's not in the dark side or something trust me yeah that's what i'm saying that i'm not don't know about your bio but yeah exactly that's a different story but uh
Jānis Amolins: not talking about that right now. However, we should talk about that, and I believe East against West should start to think about doping control as well one day. That would be great. I think, Yanis, we should do that. Not East versus West. We should do that globally, all the professional events. You cannot have one event that way, one event this way, one event that way, you understand? We need to start all together, at least the top events,
Jānis Amolins: and then so that you know what I mean. So we can have a standard. It's not like a role model and then someone who is showing. He will get invited. He will come here different way and then he will get invited somewhere else and then
Jānis Amolins: just just athletes who are not able to pass doping control will not choose to compete maybe there and that's a difference but uh the thing is uh someone should should should start to show how it should be done the best way but okay that's that's different and uh if we talk about
Jānis Amolins: this this fight then it's a absolutely uh fight for control i i don't i don't think that uh this fight will be won by someone who is uh pulling with that wrist like it was uh iraqli against john i don't think that i think it will be definitely who will take that control of hand who will take that control of uh position the the one the one who will do that will win inside
Jānis Amolins: they both can pull inside but they will not choose it for uh for for for as a as a and i don't know even first or even second move i think he would choose but i think he couldn't get there iraqli uh
Jānis Amolins: Do you think he would choose it as a first option to go inside? Not about the first option, but if I was directly, I would rather pull Ongar Baev directly inside. Let's start the inside. That's different. He's strong enough to be. But Ongar Baev is also not bad as well when he's maybe in that position, but he will not go in. He will not do it as well.
Jānis Amolins: in in his traps in his traps i kind of see that iraqli could could lose that hand as well maybe and uh i i see some uh that hunger bio could be maybe not not big advantage but some slightly favorite in this fight so you are saying that he will he will he will get the advantage of control
Jānis Amolins: I think so, in the straps, but it will be fight for a hand and then who will get that control and who will use it more effectively will win. I will ask you, Yanis, whenever your opponent has the full wrist control like this, it is different story to try to press him with that wrist. Then you stretch him and flatten his wrist.
Jānis Amolins: with the top roll and then switch to dead wrist. So this is more like to his far side than trying to press here. So my question is, do you think, in my opinion, it actually cannot directly press on Garber? But if you start with top roll and just both have the flat wrist, flat, and then to far side, far side bend,
Jānis Amolins: I see the small chance. Michael is very good about that as well and Michael was not able to do that. Michael is very good about that. Also in some positions
Jānis Amolins: where he was over center and here and already and he was trying to go for that and he was struggling with that ongar bayev is good good uh very very very intuitive he feels that position so i don't see that uh iraqli will beat him with that wrist maybe may it's it's it is some small chance always but not big like uh if if ongar bayo will take the control i think he will he will win this fight
Jānis Amolins: okay so the only way iraqli is to take uh most likely the hunger waves at least he he would he need to keep it both like neutral and then pressing i believe for iraqli to win this fight he needs that uh he needs that hand and wrist control and he needs to take yeah hunger bios rest other other i don't see much other options but
Jānis Amolins: so both the same the one who gets the control has the control will win the match that's what you're saying most likely what what if they are both equally in this position they end up on whose hand will be the buckle first round i i think in in in that position when they both are in here in center probably even uh hunger by i mean in that strap position in my eyes is in a right now
Jānis Amolins: be better I know that Irakli is breaking all those records with bicep and then doing some 130 biceps curl and everything and he's super strong but yeah that's how I see it and like we can
Jānis Amolins: it's impossible to compare but we can we can compare like john and and on their bio in that position when they both are very good with little bit lost wrist and still active pronations and so good on garbayo was pulling against john in that position and then john against iraqli so it's give some in the news like that uh on garbayo is definitely especially
Bozhidar Simeonov: you can compare on the buy of john and the iraqi john in that flat wrist position on garbayo looks looks better for me i understand yeah and and uh yeah i think like the same like comparing the match against john like they they both pulled against john i think like uh working with the hand like
Bozhidar Simeonov: uh ongarbaev is way more dangerous than iraqi he's really smart and he's using every single like millimeter and everything and he's adapting like while iraqi has more horsepower there yeah more horsepower but less control the other guy maybe a little bit less horsepower
Jānis Amolins: more control i see hunger by effect the more versatile and complete like of his style you know i will tell you something he may very well be the best armors on the i'm not talking whenever i say best people say oh it's level 11 that that's not what i'm talking about you guys know what i am talking about like at least for his size compared to others
Jānis Amolins: how would you range his explosiveness do you realize how quick it starts to match so quick do you realize how long he can pull like he can pull like 10-15 minutes he can pull this guy pull against kurdeca this guy pull against michael like and what do you think about it and his match against woman did you see his like yeah yeah
Jānis Amolins: i'm telling you his table iq is like highest the the guy feels the guy feels some response
Jānis Amolins: yeah that's the most i am impressed with ongar bio there are many who are explosives there are money many who can pull for long but uh his adjustments on table and his understanding and this part uh control that's that's what i'm really enjoying and mostly this really controlled arm wrestling i like that yeah you know he is he's like a chess player during the match yeah
Jānis Amolins: yeah previous fight Michael it was excellent yeah incredible incredible against someone like Michael like Michael pull any type of armless hundreds of times but how many times can you pull someone like Michael never pull someone like Michael but he pulled him like he pulled him like
Jānis Amolins: 30 times before, so he knows what to do, you know. And he adapts so great. Yeah, yeah. You may know what to do, but to apply that, also keep your mind so calm, like a chess player. He waited at the, you know, his side, and he knew when to attack, how to attack. One round, he got pressed by Michael. Second round, when every time Michael tried to press him again, he was just rising up, you know, and then he was like,
Jānis Amolins: it was like a free arm wrestling lesson anyone who paid pay-per-view that night even that the the the way he performed of course it is because also the greatness of michael that forced yeah to show this performance because michael pulled great match as well yeah yeah yeah yeah you can i mean like michael would kill you you know if if you don't know how to pull against him you know yeah
Jānis Amolins: I mean, like, he lost, yes, three matches at East versus West, but he lost Genadi, that's another incredibly versatile, smart guy. And then he lost against Revaz, but this guy, huge, huge, you know, his shoulder pressure was reaching, you know, far, you know. And then Ongarbaev, these are all tough matches. So, like, Bojda, don't you, do you agree that, I mean, like, this guy is incredible? Yes, that's what I'm saying, Ben.
Bozhidar Simeonov: And Michael's press, you can see how strong is Michael's press against Todd Hutchings. They're a super match. Michael's press is no joke. I don't know why this guy is even hanging under the table. 115 kilos, I'm telling you, 115 kilos, Devon, trust me, will be an incredible match. People may think it's an easy match. It's not.
Jānis Amolins: Devon has the edge, but trust me, if he gains that weight, he reminded the last event, he wants to pull Devon. He wants to get bigger, he wants to pull. That match is the match, trust me. And then when you see those two guys, incredibly intelligent at the table, incredibly have high endurance, I can't wait. I would pay, seriously, I already paid to make this match, but I would personally pay to watch that match, like $100 pay-per-view, if it was somewhere else, you know?
Jānis Amolins: anyways the last match that one versus canada i i dropped the bomb to you guys and you guys can continue king's move first round then we will see okay i i i was expecting a little bit longer and deeper analyze all right devil with the king's move gala they tried to press so
Jānis Amolins: You know, big fight, some elbow falls. A few times during the Prudnik match, Devon's shoulder went below. Referees didn't call. So later, about like maybe 10, 15 seconds later, they call it. After that round, he didn't go. But if Devon is diving there a little bit more, just to make more pressure, the more he feels in danger, the more he's diving and rising.
Jānis Amolins: so do you guys think that since he cannot go the best thing he can do is parallel who matters is there any chance even if it topples they're not again i need to but i ask this whenever i say this because devon heavily favors according to the community so whenever i try to
Jānis Amolins: little bit play devil's advocate they're like anything you hate devon you want him to lose you know like that so i need to explain the community that i'm just trying to show some possibilities if it is possible like janice what do you think about this generally i i i think again they will really struggle to to get some uh hand control
Jānis Amolins: Right now, what we're seeing from Devon, it is different. I see that you need to have a very, very good top role to beat Devon right now. It's not impossible. It is impossible to hook him, but it's very hard. And I don't think that Genadi will hook him. What I see is that Genadi can pull maybe with flat wrist, with hand wrist, go to direction to himself.
Jānis Amolins: and and maybe maybe maybe to get some uh little bit stretched out this angle and then go for this press but he will for sure i don't he will not get inside he's doing those videos with a crazy finger hand strength it will not help him and uh but maybe maybe he's showing us only
Jānis Amolins: what he doesn't care. This strong hand is great, but it's not what will help you against day one. No, what I'm saying is maybe he's just giving us those videos just to mislead us. What if Genadi goes like,
Jānis Amolins: uh high hand posture sideways you know with big curl i don't know he will don't have a hand control that's the thing and devon will block him with a pronator and uh even even if devon will be very open he will still have this hand control so uh but can he not can he not press him with those those hits he need to pull him over he need to pull him over to his side and that's the question can he do that because side side but the forward shoulder no
Jānis Amolins: i don't see him pressing devon no not not not if it is uh really uh even devon if it is open but devon is very like rotated on his side and he need to take uh this back pressure he need to take devon a little bit over to his side and then he can press but can he do that i don't know but it will be it will be very fun i i know that again
Jānis Amolins: i i expect i expect that uh he will go for 100 for that side press probably even already in first round is coming here as we have never seen him yeah yeah that's that's what i'm saying that yeah yeah that is yeah and also devon i just talked with him he is 280 pounds which is near 130 kilo he may be even 285. he will probably be in a better shape than how he was against
Jānis Amolins: So I am expecting a war. I hope for war because I know that they both are more than capable of that. And I would love to see that if Devon could get inside at some point with Genadi and maybe not in the last round when Genadi is already gassed out.
Jānis Amolins: And I want to see that Devon's arm is really tested because it will be tested for sure. I don't think that Devon's hand will be tested. That's the thing. I don't think. I think Devon's hand is too much, too much, and pronator is too much. But his arm will be tested for sure. And Genadi will try everything to open up this angle. Yeah. And Mojito, how do you see? Well, I see Devon working on his thumb.
Jānis Amolins: I think Genadi has to work on his pointing finger. Okay, test goals. Which weight category would Giannis like to compete at East versus West? Where does he see himself in the rankings? Yeah, it's I don't know if there is 75 kilo rankings, but it's 75 kilo class. Yeah, I'm saying 78 or
Jānis Amolins: or around, yeah, kilos. 75 kilo, you would pull, right? The category is 75. If I would, yeah, it's 75. I'm 78 or something right now, so to go to 75, I need to cut.
