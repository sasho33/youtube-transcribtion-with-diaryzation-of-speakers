Unknown: I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Okay, let me see what's wrong. I think you are muted. Okay, how is it now? Yeah, I can hear well. Thank you. So how are you?
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): I'm good, thank you. How about you? Okay. Sultan, you are originally from Kazakhstan. Yes, I'm from Kazakhstan.
Engin Terzi: came to california like uh almost four years ago four years ago okay and you are an arm wrestling friend that i see all the time join the podcast this time you offer me to do the translation for uh yes instead of russian to english you said how about i do that directly from kazakh language to uh
Engin Terzi: yes thank you for accepting my uh proposal my offer i appreciate it ah it's good i thank you for helping i thank you soon uh both um iraqli and kidder galley will uh join thank you inshallah i will do my best to bring best quality yeah yeah it's okay do your best
Engin Terzi: Everything will be fine, yeah. This is a very, very interesting match. Kydyrgali and Irakli, to me, both are rising stars. They are young, both are under 30s, and they both are at the very top of the armwrestling world. And it kind of excites me to see
Engin Terzi: these young guys becoming a permanent part of the elite are missing and now we will see these two two guys are pulling i i know you are from kazakhstan i am sure that you cannot be super super objective in my opinion you would be probably favoring either galley but generally also kidder galley is
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): I see on the community posts everywhere, people favour Khedr Ghali. But how do you see this match? Do you expect a hard match? I expect a hard match because Irakli is a warrior, so he's going to post everything he has on the match. So, yeah, it's not going to be an easy walk for Khedr Ghali.
Engin Terzi: not gonna be easy yeah yes i'm sure that i'm sure that iraq is coming there with 100 mindset to win but if i am not mistaken even when i did the interview podcast with uh levan levan saw this match as 50 50. so i think this is really really important match this is for world title
Engin Terzi: all title that the East versus West stage has the this year's hopefully Dennis and Devon will also join us and East versus West stage will be full with greatness with all categories and it will be okay we have Roman here we have
Engin Terzi: We thought Kydyrgali was going to come. Instead, Mazgan Shamyev came. Mazgan, this guy, his name is Sultan. He is from Kazakhstan. He lives in the United States. He will translate for Kydyrgali. For Kydyrgali, Kazakh language. So, yeah, so, I mean,
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Where is Kydyrgali? Oh, Kydyrgali is here. Salaam alaikum, Kydyrgali. Salaam alaikum.
Engin Terzi: Hello Irakli. Hello Irakli. Can you ask Irakli, does he have legal rights to carry those guns or is he a legal gun? Irakli, Irakli, I can tell you that he has legal rights to carry guns and guns. He is a very competitive guy. He doesn't have any rights to carry guns.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): that's all because of his strong opponent he's such a strong opponent he has such a strong opponent that he cannot just come with the small guns you know yeah sultan can you translate this part quickly so uh
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): So, how are you, Kydyrgali? I am good. Very good. Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. And how is your shape? I am in good shape. I am in good shape. I am in good shape. I am in good shape.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): He says, thanks God, everything is good. I feel stronger now and training hard for the title.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): So he is training hard for the title. Is he even better shape than when he was against Michael? Yeah.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Since then, I have been exercising many other sort of exercises, added many sort of exercises and sort of added weights to them. And also my own weight increased a bit. Okay, so he feels stronger. Yes. I understand. And Irakli, your opponent says that he feels even stronger than the last time.
Irakli Zirakashvili: He pulled against Michael. How about you? How do you feel? Ira, he's your opponent. He's a very strong opponent. He's a very strong opponent. He's a very strong opponent. He's a very strong opponent. He's a very strong opponent.
Roman: So he said that about himself, he also gained after his victory over the one and only John. But he knew the mistakes that he did, and he tried to overcome those mistakes, fix them. And he said that
Roman: strength-wise, I have never doubted myself in any other matches or whoever I face. If it goes to the power, I'm all in. I have no doubt of my powers. But he said that from John's match, he gained more experience and more technically, he got better than more power. Does he sometimes think that when he is getting like last match, like
Engin Terzi: Did he so much depend on his power and kind of like lost the control? And is this the lesson that he learned from last time? Can you ask him? Yeah, sure.
Roman: In all this, as you said, John, as you said, he was a great man, he was a great man, he was a great man, he was a great man, he was a great man, he was a great man, he was a great man, he was a great man, he was a great man.
Irakli Zirakashvili: I have worked with my competitors, so I don't want to say that I am good at everything, but I am good at technical work. I have worked with Magida for a long time, so I can say that I have worked with Magida for a long time. I have worked with Magida for a long time. I have worked with Magida for a long time.
Roman: So, again, he said basically yes to your question. It means that obviously he knew the power would be enough and sufficient against John, but as it appeared also to prove that strength-wise he was enough, but he was not enough technical-wise to be a dominant one.
Roman: So that's what he aimed to fix in this case. And then he also remarked the fact that Gidirgale is one of the best technicians we know in armwrestling, and especially in his weight category, one of the best, if not the most technician ones. So he sure needs to be technically prepared against Gidirgale. So that's what he also focused on. Yeah, Sultan, can you quickly translate the last part that he said? Yeah, so Jalpa Engin Terzi, Rafi Denzadullah, also
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Um, um,
Engin Terzi: I have a question for Khedr Ghalib. I personally was very impressed the way that Khedr Ghalib pulled against Michael, how patient he was, how intelligent he was, how he did the timing so good, everything. How come he performed so calmly, so experienced, so in control against
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): someone like michael while he never pulled against someone like michael before as far as i know uh
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Okay, one more thing I wanted. Was everything planned already, the way that he pulled, or he just felt and reacted?
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): During that match. Did you make any friends with Aldinala in that match? Or did you leave the match and choose your own team? I knew that Michael Toppin was going to play. I saw that he was going to play. I knew that he was going to play. I knew that he was going to play. I knew that he was going to play.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): The first thing he did was sit in the back of our team and shake hands with us. I saw a lot of videos from those days. I don't know which tactics will be the new ones. I don't know for sure, but I will try to figure it out.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Do you have any concerns about the Kings move? What do you mean? Do you have any concerns about the Kings move? No, I don't have any concerns. I got into the game in the first round. I don't know how it will turn out in the first round. In the first round, I had a good morning. In the second round, I didn't want to do that.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): uh so as he said uh he has never faced anyone uh who had uh the like wrestling style as michael open arms yeah yeah uh and he said like he watched uh the youtube videos uh with michael's pulling uh and uh has prepared his endurance enough uh for the match
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): um and also during uh during the match after the first round as he said was the lesson for him uh so yeah so he uh he mentioned uh two adjustments adjustments and tackled the style that mike offered i understand yeah i mean i was totally amazed by his performance
Engin Terzi: uh todd and olex love child thank you for your super two amazing athletes who will pull with great honor i'm grateful for this amazing match thank you my friends silky wilkie admitted were you about the gas out versus michael i thought he was actually slowing you uh can you ask him they're asking him if he was about the gas out when he pulled against michael like
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Michael finished, but was his endurance was also finishing or he still had some gas in the tank?
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): I have a lot of experience with literature. I have been studying literature since I was young. I have a lot of experience with literature.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): He said, no, he had enough of strength after the match, enough of power after the match. So he was not out of gas. He didn't run out of gas. He still had the power, he says. Okay, I understand. And Irakli?
Engin Terzi: You tried to top-roll John, and you bring him here, but you lost your wrist. And you did the transition to shoulder press. Was this part of the plan, or this just happened like it was not part of the plan? Can you ask Roman? Yeah.
Roman: Second, when the transition and the press came out, it was obvious that they were going to exploit us.
Irakli Zirakashvili: No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
Irakli Zirakashvili: In the first round of the game, we saw that he was in a very good position, and we saw that he was in a very good position, and we saw that he was in a very good position, and we saw that he was in a very good position,
Irakli Zirakashvili: It's the same with the other hand, the second, the third hand, the third hand is the hand, and the other hand is the other hand, and the other hand is the other hand, and the other hand is the other hand, and the other hand is the other hand, and the other hand is the other hand, and the other hand is the other hand, and the other hand is the other hand, and the other hand is the other hand, and the other hand is the other hand, and the other hand is the other hand, and the other hand is the other hand, and the other hand is the other hand,
Irakli Zirakashvili: Before you translate, Roman, Can you turn your phones sideways? Yeah, thank you. Yeah.
Roman: Yeah. Thank you. Okay. What was he saying? So he started saying by, uh, the plan that was not the part of the plan he has not, uh, specifically was preparing for because he had, he would never imagine that he would be pressing John down and winning in such a fashion. Me neither. I never thought that was surprised. So that was definitely not the part of his plan. He, he tried, obviously his main move, which got stopped. And then he said that, um, when I pressed him first time,
Roman: when it came like first time in the round, he felt that he kind of twerked John from the position, like made John to lose some position advantage. And he felt that in that moment, he felt that he had some quite of the power, like strength wise that he would have relied on in this position. So,
Roman: a later round especially in the third round he said that uh when uh john throws him in the center he felt problem here in the elbow and he was like he definitely knew could not go in book he said that i could not go top roll either so just in in sake of stopping john at somewhere else he dumped his wrist and he he went this so that he would
Roman: to feel the power in this lost position directly so at some point he managed to stop John and then he felt that from that position he could uh just uh like adjust and use the technique to finish John and he also said that uh even uh he mentioned petrenko's example first he said that we saw petrenko pressing him down we know how we know how strong petrenko is but
Roman: he was not that much effective with that press against john so uh he iraqi mentioned this when he was talking about there was definitely not the plan i would not imagine to press down john like yeah is it is it true that iraq's new favorite arm master is jerry catterett
Irakli Zirakashvili: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Roman: that's not the case this technique and this type of uh pulling is very harmful and very bad he's speaking from his experience and in time if you do this constantly you you're bound to get some injury so yeah yeah yeah definitely his favorite technique yeah and and can you ask that uh what does he expect from this match does he expect uh
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Like compared to John and Michael matches, what would be the difference in this match from his side? Like what does he concern about directly?
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): I am a sportsman. I am a sportsman. I am a sportsman. I am a sportsman.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): so i personally respect every uh athlete in this sport and so uh expect uh train uh always hard for every opponent um so and i can say what i'm gonna do since i respect everyone what i'm gonna do
Engin Terzi: during the match and not uh but right now i'm in very good shape and the training hard so uh inshallah i will do my best okay so he respects everyone and he is in very good shape right now and he will do his best so he's uh being so i'll stay uh respectful but he probably meant to say he's coming to it yes
Engin Terzi: Yeah, my understanding. And Irakli, compared to your previous matches, what do you expect from this Kydyrgali match? Do you, like, people think that you are very strong. This is what I read. They say Irakli is very strong. But people say that Ongarbaev has better control.
Engin Terzi: So this time, like you probably will do your best to not to go here, but this time you will probably try to have the control. Like, so do you focus more on controlling, having the hand control, or do you focus more on just with as much as pressure to do pimple? You said you took your lessons, but...
Roman: And also, if somehow, if you lose your wrist, do you think that you will be as effective against Kydyrgali as you were against John? Yes, that's right. As I said, I know that many of you wrote in the comments and I know that all of you were very happy. Kydyrgali is very strong, Kydyrgali is strong in terms of his control over the war.
Roman: I would like to say this from a different perspective, that what you are doing now is based on what you have learned from this course, what you have learned from these courses, from other courses, and you have learned that if you think about it, if you think that if you have learned from this course, then you will have the same effect as we have, or not.
Roman: And I think it was very clear that it would be very difficult to get out of it, or it would be very difficult to get out of it, or it would be very difficult to get out of it, or it would be difficult to get out of it,
Irakli Zirakashvili: First of all, I would like to say to all of you that we have to be in control of everything, we have to be in control of everything, we have to be in control of everything, we have to be in control of everything, we have to be in control of everything, we have to be in control of everything, we have to be in control of everything
Irakli Zirakashvili: I don't know if it's because of the ICT or because of the cloud, but it's not my fault.
Irakli Zirakashvili: I don't think it's a matter of individual sport and how the whole thing works. It's a matter of how it works.
Roman: So he started saying by the risk control, like when I asked, are you going to go to just search and try to pin him? Or are you going to start controlling his hand? And basically he said that every athletes like stylistically who are pulling like me and they are focused on gaining as much as control before the goal as possible.
Roman: a win by the controlling opposition opponent. And that's what he's going to do. Other than that, he also said that obviously this is a title match, very important one for me. So I will be prepared as much as I can using all the arsenals if it takes me to
Roman: finish Ungerberg just like I did against John, I will not back down and try to do that one as well, so if it's necessary. He also said that about ABC theory of armistice, like if one A beats B and B beats C, doesn't mean that A beats C. He basically said that he doesn't agree with the people who say that he did not win against John as effectively as Kirigali did against John, and therefore Kirigali would dominate Iraq. He doesn't think that way.
Roman: and he said that i'm not talking about only my matches i'm just saying in general so it's his general opinion it all depends opponents how opponent's arm feels how opponent's hands feel against you and no matter if he beats someone that uh that one guy beats you you still have a chance that's basically what he said i understand i understand if he wins this match who does he want to pull to defend his title
Roman: Ira, I would like to ask you, what do you think about this? You mentioned that you have problems and you want to say that you have your problems. Well, I would like to say that when I was a child, when I was a child, when I was a child,
Irakli Zirakashvili: I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that
Irakli Zirakashvili: So he was talking about his, he just mentioned his plan.
Roman: Uh, you know, that when he was facing John before, prior to that match, he talked with you and kinda, he kinda gave you a promise that he said that if you get, uh, the champion, if he becomes the champion of the weight category, he kinda promised you that he would want to move on and gain weight and, uh, go up to 115. Yes. He said, and he said that if he reaches like in the first half of this year to be a 105 kg.
Roman: champion, which means Kydyrgali match, obviously. After that, he said that next one, not next one in summer, that I re-questioned him, not in the summer event, he may skip or something. We don't know what will happen, but the end of this year, he will try to challenge the 115 kg. So he wants to pull, just like he promised you. He wants to pull Devon. Maybe not literally him, but maybe. Who is there? Who is there? You know, the
Engin Terzi: first there is okay whatever and can you ask that he doesn't i'm sure that he doesn't like to talk uh a lot about long-term goals but if he wins this match who would want him to who want he pull against
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Thank you. I know that you have a great team, but who do you want to play against in the next game? I will choose Altan.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): So as previously I had said that I had wanted to face Devon Larratt.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): but it didn't work out uh i will like uh talk to with my team and uh decide whether with whom i'm gonna um next time yeah and if he if he pulls devon he he wants to pull him in one one of five or 115.
Engin Terzi: people think that he's korean talking i am in fact we speak the same language turkic language but you know we have been away from there for like a thousand years that's so some we don't completely understand each other but i understand many of the things he's saying anyway so use on best kilo one more question for him can he tell me
Engin Terzi: how does he see his chance against devon because the 99 i can say percent of the community believes that devon under 115 kg is unbeatable how does he see his chance against devon
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): What are your chances of winning 115 kg? I don't know. I am a sportsman with a lot of experience. I have won 115 kg. But I will not give up.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): . . . . .
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): So sorry. So as said, he can say that he will win or lose. But he said that if he gets enough of time to prepare for that much, he's also gaining weight.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): and so yeah about the chances he didn't say that he's gonna win or lose the percentage wise but if he gets enough of time yeah he sure he will be ready for the match he will be ready another question for him usually when people pulls against devon after one two round if the match stop people gets guessed out you know they usually they say okay i'm done you know and
Engin Terzi: does Qadir Ghali believe that he can fight till the end without, you know, like Sanders pull him, Evgeny pull him, John pull him. I'm talking about people in his under 115 kg. So they, after one round, two rounds, they are just like exhausted. So does Qadir Ghali believe
Engin Terzi: that he can pull him pull against devon long matches and still can fight till the end end of the match super match or he would plan to finish him quick
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): If you look at his moves, his moves in the 1st and 2nd rounds, his moves in the 1st and 2nd rounds, his moves in the 1st and 2nd rounds, his moves in the 1st and 2nd rounds, his moves in the 1st and 2nd rounds, his moves in the 1st and 2nd rounds, his moves in the 1st and 2nd rounds, his moves in the 1st and 2nd rounds,
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): As I said before, if I have to choose between the two, I will choose Arnay. I know the art of art, and I want to be able to express my art in a small, physical way. I want to be able to express my art in a small, physical way. I want to be able to express my art in a small, physical way. I want to be able to express my art in a small, physical way. I want to be able to express my art in a small, physical way. I want to be able to express my art in a small, physical way.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): so as he said uh he will gain the 115 kg and do special exercises for endurance get enough of power and he yeah he will be prepared enough and he will prepare his endurance enough for the match so he says that you know he believes that he can fight until the end of the
Engin Terzi: rounds all of them okay okay because we stole him against michael we saw him against alex kurdesha i mean he he has incredible endurance and he is a warrior so i mean as he said you know if he gains weight and everything you know yeah i think it will be a hell of a match you know and iraqli my friends let's let's talk about some of the uh some of the other matches
Engin Terzi: uh there is a super set for you iraqli first let me silky wilkie thank you my friend iraqli have you practiced hooking with zurab how are both athletes in hook with the galley got hook with john in their match but avoided it in the next rounds uh it was not really hook john had the tornado control the first round how does the initial hit look like um can you ask
Roman: Irakli, if he hooks with Zurab. Yes, Irakli, that was a great chat. Do you hook with Zurab? No, I don't hook with Zurab. I don't hook with Zurab. I don't hook with Zurab. I don't hook with Zurab. I don't hook with Zurab. I don't hook with Zurab.
Engin Terzi: It is because one is in Tbilisi, the other one is in Batumi. Exactly. They only like doing the warm-up on the event day. It's only warm-up. They don't spar. I understand. And so let's talk about it. Irakli, how do you see Rav Vigins versus Zurab?
Roman: Before he answers, he has one question if he means to ask you. And then shall we start?
Irakli Zirakashvili: Roma, what do you think, what do you think about it? What do you think about it? What do you think about it? What do you think about it? What do you think about it? What do you think about it? What do you think about it?
Roman: So it's just poor of his interest, just out of curiosity. He said that several times, like one or two times, he got offered to pull Irakli. Much didn't happen. Like Nick was not... So he's asking why.
Engin Terzi: He's asking, was it because Kydyrgali did not think I was worthy enough or was it something else? He just asked me why. Okay, I will say something and then we can ask Kydyrgali because I asked Kydyrgali. They say Irakli is very powerful guy, super worth of opponents, but they say that they want to pull from someone from the West. This is what they told me. You can tell him because I asked the same question.
Roman: Yes, you can ask now.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Yes, yes.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Did you add my answer as well to what they told me?
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Yes, the team and I are working on it. I don't think there's anything I can do about it. It's a sport that I like. I don't think there's anything I can do about it. Thank you.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): No, I never saw that he's not a worthy opponent. And he's a very good athlete. And I never saw anything about underestimating him or anything like that. So it was basically because he wanted to pull from someone West. This is what Mazgan told me. Yeah, as you said, his team just wanted to face those from the West, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: You can, Roman, tell that basically he said the same exact thing. Because I asked the same thing, Mazgan told me that he wants to pull, like this is what excites them to bring the two worlds together, you know, West and East, you understand? He basically says that we Eastern guys all the time at the WAF, European Championships, all the time pulling against each other. This is what they told me. Yeah, I will translate that, yeah.
Roman: I agree with what you said. I think it's a very good question. I think it's a very good question. It's a very good question.
Roman: He says, thank you. Thank you for the answer. And he's understood.
Engin Terzi: super elite puller nobody can understand me can't underestimate it you are very good you know i mean i have respect for all of you you are superstar he didn't got a superstar not touching his superstar jumpers english superstar you all are superstars you know but just one needs to win one needs to lose you know but you all are whenever i do do the rating cards they are like oh why everyone is eight and a half nine nine and a half
Engin Terzi: what do you expect you know there is nothing better than this you know we're talking about the wars we're talking about messi we're talking about ronaldo we're talking about neymar you know these are those guys there is no no nothing better than these guys you know so of course it's gonna be like this this is not like national championships or something that you can find guys with it six and a half and seven you know um anyway so uh let's talk about the matches rob visions and zurab
Irakli Zirakashvili: Anu, how do you see the future of Zurab? Well, I think it's a very good question. There are a lot of things to do with Zurab. I don't know how it will be with Sasho, but Sasho is a very strong player. I don't think he will be able to play in the national team. I think he will have a very strong team and Zurab will be able to play.
Roman: uh he pointed out uh how gifted rvj is physically for arm wrestling by his hands his uh sheer size of his hand is obviously bigger than uh zura because he remembers personally seeing how like rogue versus sasha and red and he knows how sasha's how powerful sasha's wrist is and he sasha still was not that easily forcing a hook on rvj so
Roman: said that obviously is aiming for hook and it's not going to be that easy and eventually going to go for the battle of the strength and he's he thinks that in strength wise is a favorite in this case so he he goes such a manner to rob's victory right now and in kindergarten do you know rob visions
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Does he know Rob Vigent? Because Eastern guys are not so familiar with the guys from the West. That's why I'm asking you because everyone knows Rob Vigent. Can you ask?
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Do you know Rob Vision? Yes, I know him.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): So, as you said, yes, I know the Rob Vigent and I saw the last performance of Zurab in Russia. So, yeah, I think Zurab is favorite. I understand, Zurab favorite. Yeah, he was impressed with the performance of Zurab, I understand.
Irakli Zirakashvili: And exactly, Doug Erlich versus Daniel Prokopchuk. Prokopchuk and Erlich are in the same team. Yes, they are in the same team. The main thing is that Daniel is in the team, but he is not in the team. And I think he is very, very good. And Daniel is in the team. Yes, he is the main thing.
Roman: says that like uh you know big big fashion of favorite is done in this case and uh because of the uh wrist strength and technical wise daniel can just my strength also be here yeah i understand and and and either you gotta do you know douglas in last event he pulled up against coach ray he is pulling me down yes
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Daniel Procopciuc is favorite, he says? Oh. Daniel Procopciuc . Yeah, he sings that Daniel Procopciuc is favorite with his inside pulling, yeah. Okay, he's going to hook him and beat him, he says. Okay, let's see. And Adelcan Muratov versus Kody Merritt, directly.
Roman: Like, Ali-jan's left hand is insanely strong, like, the power, so he thinks that Muratov will win. Muratov will win. OK. And you, Hedergali? Muratov, Ali-jan.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Aleksey Muratov is going to win. OK. Kazakhstan is, is this because he is your countryman, or it is really you believe?
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): He's a very strong sportsman, athlete, and the preparation will be good enough. Yeah, he will win. OK, I understand. And let's go to another one, another Kazakh guy. Kydyrgali, let's continue with you. Dzeranov versus Arif. Kydyrgali, you are the master on the list of Dzeranov and Arif.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Since he's from Kazakhstan, I'm voting for him.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): but like uh those guys never faced each other before uh and i think his preparation will be better uh that one he's gonna win so he sees like a close match he thinks yes he thinks close match and he thinks that his preparation and and directly does that
Irakli Zirakashvili: He is a great sportsman, you can see it in his videos, but he doesn't like to fight. It's his style. But he doesn't fight.
Roman: See, he thinks despite, obviously he knows Dzeranov, he knows he's seen Dzeranov's training videos and stuff, he knows how strong he is, but stylistically Arif has upper hand and he thinks that Arif would take Dzeranov's wrist and beat him. Okay, so Kydyrgali says, does Dzeranov-Arif close match and Irakli says Arif is the favorite. Okay, so then let's go to the next one.
Engin Terzi: Irakli, let's start with you. So this is a very important one. He says 50-50.
Irakli Zirakashvili: He would not even accept such challenges when he thinks that, oh, I'm definitely going to be there. He was just challenged.
Roman: He would what? He would not, Irakli said that he would not even accept such a challenge where he thinks that, oh, I'm definitely going to be that guy. So he likes this challenge and he sees this challenge. He says that 50-50 is the match between. Another quick question. Is this a harder match or not than John Brzenk match for him?
Irakli Zirakashvili: Do you think that this will happen in the future with the region? No, not yet. He's not sure, actually. He's not sure? He's not sure, yes. He cannot say this in advance right now. He's not sure. Okay, okay. He will know after he pulls. I think it's possible. I think it's possible. But I don't think it will happen in the future. I think it will happen in the future.
Roman: Yeah, obviously he's coming for the victory whenever he has the match. And it's like secondary if this guy was tougher, this match was tougher than the other one. He just obviously is focused on, no matter how tough his previous matches were, focused on to win. And Kader Ghali, who is winning? Kader Ghali or Irakli? Kader Ghali is winning.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): I'm in a good training camp right now.
Engin Terzi: uh and i respect my opponent and i think he's very strong but i am preparing for victory as well so he doesn't say i will do this i will do that because only god knows but he says i'm in very good shape and i'm coming there to win time will show you is this what he's saying okay okay then let's go to the next one
Irakli Zirakashvili: Pauline versus Sasho, Irakli. Sasho. Sasho? Yes. Irakli, when Pauline pulled Rustam, who did you think that was going to win? What did you think when Pauline and Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rustam pulled Rustam? What did you think when Rust
Roman: He was thinking before the match, prior to the match, he was expecting Babaev to be favorite. He was thinking Babaev would win and Babaev would be favorite. So it was like another big surprise that Babaev started dominating. But we saw what happened. So for him, he thought that Babaev would beat him. So does he think that if Babaev didn't get injured on round three when Paul went inside, he thinks that Babaev also would win that round? Yeah, third round, right? Okay.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yeah, for sure, because we have seen
Roman: babayev's endurance in the hook wars even if he were like multiple rounds more and more and more all of them would be uh on babayev's side if he you know get injured because babayev is that much stronger hook yeah and you either gali scasho or pauline uh andrei sasha
Engin Terzi: Sasho, do you think he's going to win? Sure. I understand. Another question for you, Tedirgade. Would you consider left arm, because you won the WAF Worlds gold medal with Sokol, would you consider a left arm title match?
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): I got it. Yeah.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): i train both my hands both my arms the left and right as well and if yeah if you put a opponent for him so if he's he's ready he would consider and what if what if i put him 105 kg world title match would he accept
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): If you were given a 105 kg title match, would you accept it? Which match? A 105 kg title match. Do I accept it?
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): As he said, if he will be noticed in advance, he will be prepared enough and pull. Does he know who is the current 105 kg? Who is the champion in 105 kg?
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Ali Can, can you make two Kazakhs? Yes, I can. In the last five years, I have been in the left-hand side of the T-Tulku, in Ali Can. I have been in the left-hand side of the T-Tulku, in Ali Can. I am very happy to be a Kazakh.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): As he said, it's not good for two Kazakh guys.
Engin Terzi: what what if they are the very best only two best what to do it is not a shame you know it is in fact honor who kazakh guys are the best in the world and there is then then but he says there is no good he thinks no he said he said overall he is ready to pull him yes he is ready to pull him in overall he said okay yeah but but can you tell him that this is only an honor that
Engin Terzi: if a title match if there are two guys from same country they deserve to do the title match of course it is not preferred but it is nothing but honor it's just just think about if someday if like Genadi and Levan beats everyone what to do they are gonna pull like same as like Mike Tyson
Engin Terzi: and another guy from United States or Georgii Foreman and Muhammad Ali both were from United States but what to do if they are the best at some point you know that is no disrespect there is nothing only honor in my opinion can you translate it?
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Thank you very much for your participation.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): I'm sorry.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): So, as Kydyrgali mentioned, for now,
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): he's not gonna say anything after the match he will uh talk with his team and yeah yeah okay let's go to the next one directly or tobias left arm
Irakli Zirakashvili: Engin, he asks you as a favor, like in 10 minutes, maximum 10 minutes, he needs to leave. He's finished the last two matches.
Roman: Yeah, he's willing to answer all of it now just to make sure that questions are answered. So your question was Tobias versus Vitalii? Yeah. Yeah, okay. You know, Roman, Roman, tell him this. You know, I invite them to do the best stage. He can share 15 minutes for me.
Roman: Undoubtable favorite is Laletin in this case.
Engin Terzi: He said Laletin is the favorite. It's not a Turkish word. It's Arabic and I'm sure that the Muslim guy Ungar Bey would know it. Say again, Roman. He said undoubtable favorite is Laletin in that match. Okay. Laletin would be. And what do you think about it?
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): Vitalii is a very experienced athlete.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): uh arm wrestler he has many years of experience so yeah he sings the vitality is a favorite we tell you the favorite okay and directly safi so
Irakli Zirakashvili: It was a really good match. It was a really good match. It was a really good match. It was a really good match. It was a really good match.
Roman: Judging by his recent experience in sparring with Revaz, he knows how much Revaz gained from his last appearance at East vs. West. But on the other hand, we know how much, how really strong Dave is, like really strong. And that's why he thinks he finds this match very, very interesting. But lastly, he said that if Revaz manages to deliver his shape
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): to the match 100% that he is in right now, that it means he would be favored. He would be favored. Okay. And you, Kedar Ghalib? Shafi versus Revaz? I think both of them are great sportsmen. I think both of them are great sportsmen. I think both of them are great sportsmen.
Engin Terzi: uh they are both super heavyweight very strong athletes and i think they're equal and they can say who's gonna win they're equally yes oh 50 50. uh okay the last one directly uh gennady versus devin how
Irakli Zirakashvili: So this is the match like in most
Roman: are excited for after his match obviously so his second favorite match at this event he says that we know how strong Genadi is but we also know how great how good Devon is but 60 to 40 he thinks Genadi would win because Genadi's power like this power gap is sufficient enough so he
Roman: Did he recently train with Genadi? For his preparation of this event, they have not trained together yet. Does he think that Genadi right now is in better shape than before?
Roman: By what he hears from other people. Yeah, by what people say around this circle and also for the videos, it's appeared to be. Oh, he thinks he's stronger now. Genadi is stronger now.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): i understand and last question to either galley who is winning gennady or devon um
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): He is the head of the team. He is a very smart athlete. He is the head of the team. He is a very smart athlete.
Sultan (Translator for Kydyrgali Ongarbaev): So, Genadi is a very strong athlete, a Georgii athlete, and Devon Larratt has a great stamina and he's a smart puller. So, I think it's got to be 50-50. 50-50, he's thinking. Okay. Anyways, thank you, guys. Thank you very much, Irakli. Thank you, my friends.
