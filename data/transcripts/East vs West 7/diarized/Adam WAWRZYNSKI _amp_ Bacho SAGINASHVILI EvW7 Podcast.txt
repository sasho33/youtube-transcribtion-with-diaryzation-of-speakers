Engin Terzi: Hello, guys.
Engin Terzi: nice to see you all waiting for my guests to come and then we can hello
Engin Terzi: Yes I am.
Engin Terzi: Let's see how our guests shape. I saw Bacho like four years ago. Yes, I did the iftar. When did I do this? About one hour and 20 minutes ago.
Engin Terzi: At a mortgage, it would be light for jumbo zinc.
Engin Terzi: Thank you.
Engin Terzi: My comeback. My comeback. I don't know. I'm still training. I'm not happy with where I am right now. Thank you, Paul. Thank you. Hello, Christopher. Thank you. Witness Adam. Adam versus Zolaev. Zolaev didn't look in a good shape.
Engin Terzi: Okay. Thank you.
Engin Terzi: Can you hear me, my friend? Hello, Adam. Good to see you. It's good to see you. How are you? Good, good. Can you turn the phone sideways? Yeah. Yeah. Is that better? Yeah. Perfect. And I will see how you are. I don't know. One of us is getting cut, but I don't know.
Engin Terzi: I think it's lagging. Uh-oh. Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There we go. Okay. Roman also joined the translator. Yeah, I was telling you to show us bicep so I can see. Oh, yeah. Get ready.
Adam Wawrzynski: That's a bazooka. Adam looks ready. Hey Adam, how are you doing? Good, how are you? Doing fine. Yeah, I was lagging. I changed it from the Wi-Fi to the mobile. Good deal. So Adam, how is everything? Yeah, it's great. I can't complain. Training has been wonderful. I've had no hiccups. Everything is
Engin Terzi: on schedule and exactly what i've predicted it to be um so that's good and i'm just right you didn't look super dominant in last event is it because you are still picking your your plan is to pick at the time of the east versus west or the opponent was just super strong well so yeah so i mean obviously my main
Adam Wawrzynski: peaking goal here is East versus West. So a lot of times, a lot of times when I have a tournament or an event where I'm trying to be in top shape for, I will go to other events, um, just for the sake of practicing and grabbing different hands. And I mean, that's why we talk getting long enough rest just for the event. So it is not like it is the part of the preparation is what you are seeing. Absolutely. I mean,
Adam Wawrzynski: i didn't rest at all and i pulled three weight classes so oh you pulled three weight class that the one tough match i saw was one of those classes oh yeah i mean that's what everybody fails to realize i mean a lot of those and don't get me wrong i mean robbie russell is a very underrated uh arm wrestler we have always our styles have always collided and there were many good arm wrestlers at that tournament but
Adam Wawrzynski: everybody's bragging about matches they're having with me and i'm on i'm pulling three-way classes and i haven't even specifically prepared for the event so i just let it i just let it go you know it doesn't it doesn't bother me but uh yeah and hello bacho bacho can you have can we have more light on your face
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): yeah there he he's in the car so that's i guess that says yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's how i see he doesn't want to show everything to adam you know maybe he's hiding some surprise yeah yeah and can you ask him how his preparation is about the debut but regular medicine training uh but you guess me training
Engin Terzi: I think he cannot hear us. Yeah, can you? Bacho, I may call, message him, but... Okay, it's Mr. Andy Bacho. He's connecting the audio now. Oh, yeah, okay, now he's doing it, yeah. And then let's continue with you, Adam. This young guy is thinking that you have no chance at all to beat him.
Adam Wawrzynski: And then you said that you like his confidence, but you think that he is not that good about math. Not that good. Correct. That is correct. I mean, yeah, I like where his head's at. I would hope that he believes he can beat me. But to say that there is no chance
Adam Wawrzynski: is foolish because well there's always a chance um yeah that might be small there might be and then how do you see your chances well and again i i've always in every big match i've been in um at least the past four or five i can think of i have always had no chance so
Adam Wawrzynski: You know, this might just be another one of those where I have to go out there and prove once again, where my capability is. Um, I mean, I see certain videos of, of, of him on YouTube. It's extremely impressive, uh, his training and, um, you know, credible arm wrestlers are saying about him. So I do believe this will be my largest test yet by a long shot. So.
Engin Terzi: i'm coming in preparing for that do you like do you see like pulling against a young guy like macho do you see this like were you expecting to pull against someone who already proved himself and like ranked about you improving weight
Engin Terzi: know the georgians speak highly about him but we know that it's not proving it they just tell their opinion right to to pull like just for example to pull against someone like zura would it motivate you more than pulling against pacho or to pull against someone that like all those top georgians are thinking that like the guy is untouchable you know which one is more
Adam Wawrzynski: exciting and motivating for me for you um i wish i could give you a more exciting answer but the answer to that is neither i i treat every opponent the same way i could be pulling zurab i could be pulling um you know bozidar again i could be pulling bacho it doesn't matter who i'm arm wrestling when i'm on that stage at that level i understand that
Adam Wawrzynski: The opponent that's across the table from me is also at that level for a reason, and he is not standing on that stage because he didn't earn it. So I take everybody the same. I do. I understand. I know more or less motivated. Do you see yourself, like, I'll just say, like, whenever you were pulling against Bojidar,
Engin Terzi: majority of the people thought that you had no chance majority they didn't know about you and but from your own side do you have more chances against Bacho than you had against Bojidar if you think that before you pull against Bojidar like to come into this match like do you see yourself more or less favorites when you compare
Adam Wawrzynski: Yeah, there is definitely more favor towards me in this match with respect to what you're saying. Of course, I always have my tight group of individuals, people that are close to me, training partners who believe in me, no matter who I'm arm wrestling. And they believed in me last East versus West as well. But this time, there's definitely people outside of that circle who
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): who have seen more of me and do believe I could win. However, with that being said, I think Bacho is the favorite from a war standpoint, so. I understand. Okay, Bacho, if you go back to you, how is your preparation, Bacho? Bacho, . Oh, now he can hear us.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): I don't know what to say. He's been preparing for two months and he's quite confident and quite satisfied with his shape right now. He thinks he's in good shape. Ask him, you know, like he's being careful, right? So not to push him so much and get injured before the match.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Yeah, he's trying to stay injurless. Can you ask him how old he is? 18 or 19? He's 18. He's 18 years old. Yeah, I remember him.
Engin Terzi: He doesn't remember me, right? That we put little at the side of the table in Romania. He's smiling. Of course, he remembers you. Even then, if he's 18 now, he was 14 then, he was not normal. He was seriously strong.
Engin Terzi: He was inexperienced, but he was still strong. At the side table, he was beating majority of the senior pullers. And can you ask him, compared to that time, he's probably like, it's not even comparable, right? His power.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Well, this is what I wanted to say, that the machine was built in the 1940s, and it was very old, and the machine was in a very bad shape, and it was very difficult to build it. Yes, it was in a very bad shape. It was built in the 1940s.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): yeah you you're right he was 14 uh that the times and this shape is uncomparable it's no not even worth to mention the the gap of this shape that he's in right now he personally told me that adam has no chance at all and you see it's like strategy to intimidate openness because i also share this
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Or does he really believe that his opponent has no chance at all? I don't think anyone has a chance against me. That's my opinion. That's my opinion. That's my opinion. That's my opinion. I don't think anyone has a chance against me. That's my opinion. That's my opinion.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): He said that stylistically the way Adam pulls is inside and Bacho is himself outside puller and he thinks that stylistically he would give himself more chance. That's why he's not that much worried. So he's gonna top roll Adam? That's what he says?
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Most likely, yes. Yeah. What's that? Most likely, yes. He said, yeah. But what Adam hooked him? That's not going to be a problem for him. He can also fight biceps to biceps. No problem. He's ready for a hook. And Adam's endurance, we saw against Bojidar.
Engin Terzi: yeah it is like very very very very hard thing to exhaust bojidar in hook you know bojidar is one of those guys that has incredible hook endurance and but adam's endurance was superior yeah and yeah yeah yeah and and does macho not underestimating him a little bit if he catches you know what what what what what
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): His endurance is better, and then he makes Bacho tired at the end. Yes, I understand. And I would like to ask you about this movement, that the movement of a person, for example, is like this, like this, like this, and now he has put everything on him, and now he is able to move, and if he is able to move, and if he is able to move, and if he is able to move, and if he is able to move, and if he is able to move, and if he is able to move,
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): So he's doing static holds obviously as a part of his training and he said that endurance wise I'm also quite endurable when I do static holds like stopped pulling. So I guess he's confident in his endurance as well.
Engin Terzi: He believes that static bicep hold really replaced the long hook.
Engin Terzi: uh to be honest i asked him uh what if adam and you stop in center and go to hook by hook so it was kind of my suggestion what would you do then that's what my question and then he answered me but now i will ask him if he expects no but what i'm just saying that his answer was holding bicep static you know bicep static what you feel while you are holding the bicep you know static bicep hold and when you are armless and there are a lot of at the same time pronator supinator wrist
Engin Terzi: let everything you know just like one part hook is not only like your bicep so what i'm just saying that does he also think you know like he may need or does he also train his hook for endurance because what i will just say that if he cannot topple adam and if adam stops him that may be a long war you know this is what i tried to say you know
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Bacho, when you talk about static, I mean, when you talk about the hook and the key, many people think that the static is the key, because you have different pronunciations and different ways of saying it. If you put the key in the right place, it will come out, and if you put it in the wrong place, it will come out, and if you put it in the right place, it will come out, and if you put it in the right place, it will come out, and if you put it in the right place, it will come out, and if you put it in the right place, it will come out, and if you put it in the right place, it will come out, and if you put it in the right place, it will come out, and if you put it in the right place, it will come out, and if you put it in the right place, it will come out, and if you put it in the right place, it will come out, and if you put it in the right place, it will come
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): There's no problem with that. And now we're going to move on to the next one, that's it. We're going to move on to the next one. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Okay. So first of all, he said that if match stops, I'm more than ready to pull as long as it takes. And then he said, so Bacho, you are feeling that he will stop you and eventually the match will go in a long war. And he was kind of hesitant because he doesn't know how good Adam is. Obviously, he cannot claim anything, but he said that I don't really think so that he would stop. Yeah.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): when i asked him are you expecting are you expecting him to stop you and you get stopped in hook and long war and he said that i tried to make him give me answer and he said that no i don't i don't think so that that was basically so he's probably thinking that he's gonna finish the match quick it's not gonna go to do hook battle and if it goes there he's ready as well that's that's exactly okay adam what's what's your take about this if you have anything to say
Adam Wawrzynski: yeah that is a lot to take in i will say that you know there's always a question mark for me when it comes to overall power on the table because you know if let's just say that boccio is just a whole nother level stronger than i am then nothing matters top roll hook endurance it doesn't matter
Adam Wawrzynski: but if if our strength levels are somewhat comparable then he's in for it and i can tell you that there are things you can't be so foolish and you can't be so foolish not you bato you can't be so foolish just in just in general not just him you can't be so foolish in the sense that
Adam Wawrzynski: Um, there's lifts that you're feeling good in and there's positions and his style is this, and I'm going to do that because let me tell you something. Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Those are great words of Mike Tyson. And, uh, I feel like that's everywhere in competition. Doesn't matter what sports you're in. And sometimes you got to take a step back and understand that things may not be quite as they appear.
Adam Wawrzynski: And I'm just really excited for this matchup. I'm really excited. I'm more motivated than ever. I, I, I hope that he doesn't top roll me too hard. Cause that's where my, you know, that's where I'm weak at. I I'm a hook arm wrestler. And you know, if you, if you, if you top roll me and you get my hand flat, you know, it's over, I can't pull. So
Adam Wawrzynski: Tell them maybe to give me some chance and go somewhat inside me a little bit so that we can make a good show. Is it sarcastic? I hope it is. No, I'm extremely top-rollable. Just go look at all the film that's out there. If somebody tries top-roll, I see that you also pronate as well. You don't really fell there, you know?
Adam Wawrzynski: The way that you are talking is just like you hope that you give me something. Come on, man. I can't believe you are saying that. He's so strong, Eng, and he's so strong. Okay, that's why I said it's sarcasm, I think. Give me something. I don't like this quality about me, but I seem to be the puller that is very secondary. I tend to take what others give me.
Adam Wawrzynski: And I really shouldn't be that way. And I'm working to not be that way because, you know, that can come and bite you in the rear end, especially against a very strong, young, powerful arm wrestler. So that's why I tell him that, you know, things may not always seem to be what they appear, you know. So you are thinking that Bacho is going to learn a few things? He may. Basics?
Engin Terzi: Absolutely. Unless he's a whole completely different level stronger than me. And I, that might be the case. Do you expect, do you expect such thing? Like do you expect it? Like there is a possibility an 18 years old guy just comes to the world level stage and then suddenly became like untouchable. Do you think? No, without sarcasm, I fully understand.
Adam Wawrzynski: that his strength level may be a complete another level than me. That's my mindset training for this match. In my head, I truly believe that he is on another strength level and that I need to reach that by the time it comes around. That's my mindset because that's what I'm being told. You believe in everything you're told? Yeah. Why not? Tricky questions.
Adam Wawrzynski: Absolutely. Because I see you a little bit incompetent. Is that true or are you just pretending? There's no incompetence. That's respect. For me to put my opponent at a level above me is for me to humble myself and realize that I need to work harder than I've ever worked to be at that level. There's no incompetence.
Adam Wawrzynski: That approach is way better than being delusional and saying that, oh, I'm way above his level. Yeah, that approach is better. Gentlemen, I would be foolish to sit here and tell you that I'm a 26-year-old man who's been arm wrestling for X amount of years and this 18-year-old kid doesn't have a chance against me or he's never been at this level and he hasn't proved himself or X, Y, or Z. I'd be extremely foolish to come here
Adam Wawrzynski: But there can be something in between, you know, like in between. I'm not a half-ass kind of guy. No, no, I mean, you don't need to really bring him up here. And then, you know, you can, I mean, be realistic as well. But let's see how it will be. I take every opponent the same. Everybody I'm put across the table from, they get put up here.
Engin Terzi: oh okay so this is a general strategy not only for bacho not no not only for him oh okay now i understand now i understand yeah if it was only especially for bacho then i would just say that you are intimidated a little bit but you say that this is your mental strategy when you are preparing you make them so high in your head so that you may even surface like where they are
Adam Wawrzynski: i'm crossing all paths i'm checking off all boxes and i could tell you whatever the outcome of this match is going to be i would hate to sit back and look at it and say i didn't do everything that i could have so but from this i understand that there is no way that you are underestimating this guy that's what i realize correct yeah okay yeah yeah correct and roman if you want you can translate with a bit
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Okay, I will take my time. Bacho, this is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a very interesting topic, and I would like to say that it is a
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): And I don't want to say that it's been 22 years since I was born, that I was born, that I was born, that I was born, that I was born, that I was born, that I was born, that I was born, that I was born, that I was born, that I was born, that I was born, that I was born, that I was born, that I was born,
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): yeah i briefly translated the approach that adam has uh about this match and in general for his opponents and uh bacho said that i mean we will see at the table uh what's the uh who who's stronger and who's uh better armistice and stuff like this so toy table will show when the time comes adam there is a question they are asking you do you have like instagram or youtube account no no i don't
Adam Wawrzynski: I don't have a favorite lift because my training is always changing. Lifts are always changing. I like compound movements and
Engin Terzi: I like to always find a way to integrate my hand and wrist into every workout that I'm doing. I have a question for you. Do you think you will be in even better shape than when you were here last time? Yes. Yes, okay. Absolutely. That is what I wanted to hear. Ryan Bull Ballinger, Adam Wojcicki for the win. Team USA.
Engin Terzi: Thank you for your super chat. Thanks, Ryan. Steve Wolf. I hope Adam destroys Bacho. Bacho looks like a big head. I'm not sure Bacho is a big head. Thank you for your super chat. Bacho is a confident guy who has dreams. This is how I see. I don't know if you see any different than I see, Adam.
Adam Wawrzynski: No, I see it the same way. He's a young man who's extremely confident because he trains hard and he has goals. And he's done well so far with it. So, no, I don't think he's got a big head. I just... I see it the same way. You do? I do? Okay. Yeah. And, Roman, can you ask Bacho, like, what is his short-term...
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Does he have a goal to win the title of East vs. West at 95 kg? Bacho, this is a very important question. And if you think about it, if you were to win the title at 95 kg, what would you do as a champion of East vs. West?
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): It was in 1995, right? It was in 1995, right? I don't know. I don't know, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember, I don't remember,
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): So he could not answer my first question, so I replied myself. Basically, he's planning to become 95 kg champion at East versus West, yes. And his left arm as good as his right arm?
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Somebody just mentioned him beating Samushia, but there was left arm, and Samushia's left is not anywhere close to his right. Yeah, I have also seen that video. Yeah, he said that his left is roughly the same, equal level as the right. I understand. I understand. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: this event will be a good opportunity for macho to show where he is at and and then we will see exactly where he is then then then we will see let's see let's see how it will be that is that is the true international the highest level arm wrestling reality check yeah and then then we will understand
Engin Terzi: And I know, Adam, you like to focus on your upcoming match. But do you feel yourself that in some time, in the short term, you want to also get a shot for the title? Do you feel yourself...
Engin Terzi: ready for that or you just need a little bit more time how do you see like would you pull anyone at that category or you would just say that i need maybe like six more months a year you know or i i i'm confident myself i feel i feel like i'm ready to pull at that level the the title shot um
Adam Wawrzynski: know with the spacing of the east versus west events that's enough for me i mean you know after this event like i say you know i got i like to focus on one thing at a time but after this match if things were to go my way then yeah i do see i do see myself ready i think this is a good test for both of us yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: I really do, because the first time I know kind of qualification, you know, on that way, on the way to the title, maybe not the maybe not the final qualification, but this is probably the one before the title. Yeah, I think that at least my last appearance at East versus West was a good test to see if I was on that level to be to be at an event like that.
Engin Terzi: pulling a top-notch guy at a slightly lower weight and now i feel like this match is really a more of like a i would say a quarter final like you said um yes yes yes this is how i see a quarter final and the winner of this will go to a match to be qualified finally for a this is how i see like from outside perspective but do you have like like for example we all have like there is nothing
Engin Terzi: like the biggest thing is this this world you know we don't have aliens from other uh planets or something so this is and what is happening on this stage is as tough as it can be so then and like this what i am saying do you have a dream step on that stage finally to become the best armistead on the planet
Adam Wawrzynski: yeah so of course of course i want to be as great as i can that means you know having the title but the other tough thing is is the 95 kg title belongs to a fellow brother of mine paul lynn and one of the things i really cherish about
Adam Wawrzynski: having you know being fortunate having the opportunity to eat overseas at least for me is that we get to pull top-notch guys from all over the world and you may happen and that's just that's the most amazing thing to me and i would rather i would sacrifice having the title if it means that i get to keep coming over and pulling guys from different countries i mean do you think that do you think that
Engin Terzi: like if paul remains to be title holder and do you think that if it's a time do you think that two fellow americans because it is like we are just right now just thinking you know i'm not saying that it will happen or not but what i'm just saying that there may be a point that two georgians may do the title match
Engin Terzi: If it is proven, no one else and there may be a time two Americans can do this. I wouldn't prefer. I would never set a match, probably. I say never, but most likely. The two guys from the same country against each other. Unless that's the title match. And if it's a title match, I will not care if it is America versus America, Canada versus Canada or
Engin Terzi: Kazakistan versus Kazakhstan or Georgii versus Georgii. So that is gonna happen. And pulling against, that would also be another honor just like if there was a time that like two guys from same country, I mean, like the winner will for sure be that country. There is nothing shame, there is no hostility or anything. That it is in fact an honor that, you know, two guys from same country are like the best two.
Adam Wawrzynski: get the shots you know i don't know if you agree or not but there may be a time for that as well yeah i i agree i um i'm like i said the the most to some people going to east versus west the number one goal and attraction and motivation for them may be the title in my case the title belongs to an american i'm just my i'm i'm motivated surely by
Engin Terzi: having the opportunity to go overseas and pulling the best of the, yes. Yeah, so you are saying that you would prefer to pull title match only if an American is not holding the title. You would prefer the second best and let the title stay with the American guy. And then if he ever loses, then you can get a shot. This is what you're saying. Well, kind of.
Adam Wawrzynski: i'm just saying that if it ever would get to the to the if it ever would get to the point where two americans it's undisputed we've matched everybody up everybody else and two americans myself and paul are at the top that match absolutely needs to happen then yeah okay yeah this is the point that i'm talking about yeah yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: there are some others too you know it's a beauty people whenever i was setting this many matches people were telling me why are you setting all those matches like we will be out of matches we will run out of the matches it will never happen more you give chances more new stars will you know rise and then and then the results may be changing you know this year this guy may beat people
Engin Terzi: like do you think that morozov is the same guy that prudnik beats a year ago i don't think so no no things may be changing you know this is what i am saying that people are thinking that like that it will never lose its excitement you know just because people are asking if people are saying that they hear that zurab and basho in the same level like around same level what does
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): How does he think about this? How does he see himself? We know that Zurab just won the AMC event. Can you ask him what he thinks about this? Yes, for sure. Bacho, I would like to ask you a question. You are from Russia, but you are from Zurab.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): I don't know how to say this, but I don't know how to say this, but I don't know how to say this, but I don't know how to say this, but I don't know how to say this, but I don't know how to say this, but I don't know how to say this, but I don't know how to
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): So he said that he cannot give the answer in comparison of him versus Zurab because they have actually never pulled and he doesn't have enough information. Then I asked how about maybe you have pulled someone who also has pulled
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Zurab and draw some conclusions or some comparisons. Oh, but they told me, Genadi and others told me that he trained with Zurab and they said it's 50-50. No, no, brother. Actually, I was, if you're talking with me, Genadi. You remember, you were there too. I was the one who was training and I never remember saying that, I actually remember telling you that Bacho and Zurab never trained, never pulled each other. You can check it, you know.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): It's just like the video. They said it's just 50-50. It is 50-50. How is it 50-50 if they never pulled?
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): they they think that they could be roughly in the same same level they never said that they say that it's 50 50 by only guessing not not not that they saw something and okay not if have pulled both and gennady was the one who said that man oh okay gennady was comparing by his own experience yeah and but you just reminded me about that video and yeah obviously i was the one who recorded so yeah
Engin Terzi: Kennedy was the one who has pulled both, Bacho and Zurab. And he said that it's going to be... They actually never pulled against each other. Yeah, each other have never pulled. Okay. And can you also ask him, like, if he thinks that he's going to beat Adam, just say that if he's right. If he beats Adam, like, is he ready to pull against anyone right now at 95? Or he wants to go step by step?
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): I just want to understand where he sees himself.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): OK, OK. So first, I asked your question. And he said that in 95 kg, I don't have anyone specific. And then I asked, how about the other categories? And he said, schoolboy, the name. He would wish to pull the schoolboy. No, no, no. I didn't ask if he wants to pull someone. But in 95, he said, I could pull anyone. I don't have any specific target, he said. No, no. Does he believe that he is ready to pull against anyone and he can beat them? This is how he thinks?
Engin Terzi: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, he believes he's ready for anyone. Okay. Yes. Okay. We will, we will understand after, after he pulls Adam. There is a Super Chat, Christopher Honeycutt. Thank you and you for all these events and your efforts to make arm wrestling better. Also, I love Adam.
Engin Terzi: no nonsense attitude go adam yeah that will be interesting that that is interesting to you another one people adam should be in his team he looks like eastern what was that they they say that they he says that three four says that you should be in team east you look more like eastern than the western he says i don't know
Engin Terzi: I do have a lot to send my blood. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And okay. Let's, let's talk about the, the, the predictions, but, but, uh, Adam, was it surprising to you to see, uh, Bacho being so confident, not only about you, but feeling ready for anyone? Uh, honestly, no.
Adam Wawrzynski: It doesn't. I don't know. I mean, no, I guess I, there's a lot of factors that go into that. I don't know why. I mean, I like his confidence. Why he feels that confident. He must, there might be things I don't know. You know, he, I don't know who he trains with. I don't know who he's gripping up with, who he's pulling, what competitions he's going to, but
Engin Terzi: I just hope there's a lot of evidence to back that up, and it seems like there is. I understand. But in your head, you're going to just match winning, right? Absolutely. I don't cross the Atlantic Ocean to lose. Okay, that's what I want to hear. That's what I want to hear. You just don't want to talk so much. Anyway, so let's start.
Engin Terzi: uh daniel prokopchuk douglas adam do you remember prokopchuk yes yeah and he's pulling against douglas yes and how do you see um so what's daniel's weight at
Engin Terzi: Where does he walk around? 78-79 kilo and the category is 85. So he is around 170 maybe 473. But the category is 187. That's a good. It's a great matchup. I trying to look at. I mean, of course, I'm always going to root for Team West. I want Doug Erlich.
Adam Wawrzynski: go in there and clean them up. I pulled with Daniel Propichuk a little bit on the after table at East versus West five. He felt good. And I think if Doug can, I think if Doug can handle his back pressure and can maintain his back pressure, he'll be in good shape. I'm giving Doug, I'm giving Doug the advantage. So you are seeing Douglas at least slightly favorites.
Adam Wawrzynski: Yes, I think stylistically, power, when you kind of combine everything, I'm seeing Doug as a 60-40. 60-40. 55, 40. OK, OK. And can you ask Bacho if he knows this Atlas, Douglas and Daniel Prokopchuk? Bacho, Prokopchuk and Daniel, what do you think about Douglas? What do you think about him?
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): He unfortunately doesn't know those pullers yet. He doesn't even know Daniel Prokofchuk. Let me ask Adam, Rav versus Rav.
Adam Wawrzynski: That's another good one. I mean, Zareb has proved time and time and again just how much of a warrior he is. You know, Rob Bidgen Jr. is one of those guys. Roman, can you ask Bacho if the sound is coming from him all the time?
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Ah, I will ask him too. Yeah, OK. Yeah, I think it will fit. Yeah, go ahead Adam. Sorry. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, I mean, like I say, Rob Vision Jr. is one of those guys who is extremely genetically gifted and, you know,
Adam Wawrzynski: I mean, everybody's talking about how he's been on the couch and hasn't been doing anything, but I mean, that, that's, that may not be true at all. I mean, just because you're not out competing doesn't mean you're not working out or training on the table or doing anything. And I mean, I think if Rob vision junior is coming in in good shape, then he it's, it's going to be hard for Zurab to beat him because he has a lot of, he has a lot more in the toolbox than Zurab.
Adam Wawrzynski: And Rob has an extremely large hand and he's very good at using it and controlling opponents up top. And I think if he's smart and I know, I mean, I know he's, I get really easy. I see a nice lane for him to win. Um, but the, the, so stylistically I give Rob the edge over Zurab, uh, but otherwise
Adam Wawrzynski: would i almost i give the edge a little i have to give it to zurab i have to give the power edge to zurab um and who is winning at the end i think it's a close match i mean i'm rooting for rvj all day long don't get me wrong uh okay but uh i i think it's a really i think it's a close matching and i can't i can't give a favor favorite okay okay and let's go to alijan murado cody do you know alijan
Engin Terzi: adam um the kazakh side and just pull against uh petrenko in last event i don't know if you saw with the half left and match they had it right right yeah and he also also won the wolf in super heavyweight while he was like 209 or something 210 or something oh wow hmm
Adam Wawrzynski: I don't know. I don't know. I mean, that's the first I'm hearing he won the WAF in the open category, left-handed. Yeah. It's hard for me to root against an American. I mean, I'm always rooting for the Americans, and it's hard for me to say that one has an advantage here over the other. I mean, Kody is a – I mean, he's got the size on him, that's for sure. Yeah. And I don't know – I mean, that may –
Engin Terzi: don't know it's another one i can't 50 50. i know a lot of um alizon has the they're giving him the edge i've noticed that he's been maybe a little bit of the favorite yeah people because of his explosiveness they say that you know he's the uh favorite because he starts quick but while probably cody is 150 pounds minimum yeah if not
Engin Terzi: heavier than Alizhan and also he is very strong. Kody is also very strong, but we will see. Yeah, I'm excited for that one too. Yeah. How about, how about Arif versus Dzeranov? Do you remember these guys? Arif is the guy that lately pulled against Corey West and Dzeranov was in the same event. I think you were there. He pulled
Engin Terzi: Bortolato and Kalinichenko beat them 3-2, 3-2. You heard the same thing that Bortolato was there, right? Wagner Bortolato from Brazil. He almost fainted. Remember? Yeah. I remember Georgii. You remember Georgii. Georgii and Arif are calling you. I remember him and I was very impressed by both performances that he gave that day.
Adam Wawrzynski: and RF again, there's another one who, who was, uh, I was impressed with in the last season versus West, but I think, I think it's going to be one of those matches where RF might go up one or two matches on them. And then we may see something different happen. Yeah. Yeah. Georgii doesn't quit.
Adam Wawrzynski: uh he's he you know he gets beat he he goes back he thinks about he's smart you know he doesn't quit so it may be one of those interesting matches where you know he goes down one or two matches and then comes back and make it makes it interesting i'll give the slight edge to arthur yeah but but you are saying that anything is possible yeah right yes sir i understand yeah and let's talk about brandon versus samusha
Adam Wawrzynski: yeah that matches another very very interesting match so so so that's an interesting match because there's a link and that link is craig tulie you know we saw we saw davit and craig pull and davit kind of kept craig uncomfortable craig never really got that initiation like he likes and i think it it
Adam Wawrzynski: It, he kept them out of his comfort zone and, and was able to win that way convincingly. Um, and Craig and, and Brandon pulled and had an absolute war. Now, Craig was able to, I feel like Craig was a lot more comfortable in the El Cesar match than the Samushia match. You see, that's the, that's how I dissect that. I don't look at it as well.
Engin Terzi: brandon and craig had a good match and craig got beat kind of bad and so this match isn't close that's not how i see that um it depends on positioning you know if brandon can get his position then the things can be different if it goes to power power versus power probably someone should look stronger on the paper but but it depends which position
Adam Wawrzynski: brandon will gain if he gains the position he likes then things may be different yeah i think if brandon can utilize his height then he's gonna give samusha some trouble and you also have to realize that brandon is a very large he's huge i mean for he might be the largest 85 kg athlete i've ever seen and matter of fact when
Adam Wawrzynski: You told me that they were pulling at 85 kg. But probably he will be minimum 200 pounds by the time of competition. Right, right. When you told me that they were pulling at 85 kg, I almost didn't believe it because I'm thinking, how is Brandon Alcester going to cut to 85 kg? But if he can make that cut, he won't be anywhere close to there. He'll be probably over 200 pounds.
Engin Terzi: more like 205 or 210, I'd say, by competition day. So Davit's going to be pulling a much larger human being. Yeah. So it's also up to how much Brandon is going to lose or not when he's losing power. I mean, the weight. Yeah. Yeah. Another super trip or I will always support Adam. He's so humble and respectful to everyone.
Engin Terzi: He is a pure sportsman, a good example of a strong athlete and a quality person. Thank you, sir. Thank you. You have fans. The way that your unique behavior is gaining you more fans. And let's go to another one. Pauline versus Bacho. Can you ask? Can you ask Bacho if he knows Pauline?
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): He thinks that Sasho will be victorious.
Engin Terzi: Oh, he knows who Sasho is? He knows both. Oh, he knows both of them? Yeah. Okay, that's good. Yeah. Bojidar is on the chat. Hello, Bojidar. He is saying, how is Bojidar saying that he will beat everyone at 95 kg if he doesn't know a single arm wrestler? Please ask him if he knows Sasho, Pauline, Babaev, and Hutchings.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): uh i know sasho he said that he knows pauline as well did he say that he can beat anyone at 95 kg or he said he is ready to pull against everyone uh he said that he would take anyone's uh anyone's challenge whoever you throw at him under 95 kg
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): He didn't have any specific target. He's ready to pull anyone, yeah. He never said he would beat everyone. He's not even saying that he would crash and beat Adam. The table will show, right? Okay, okay, okay. So, and how you see this match, Adam? I love Paul Linn. I love Paul Linn. I think, I just, Paul Linn has a lot of tools and he's getting a lot better at using them.
Adam Wawrzynski: in these matches. Um, I just remember watching him from year, you know, a few years ago and, uh, and up till now, and I got Paul in winning. I got Paul in winning. I think he knows where to put the pressure. I think hook to hook. I mean, that's where Sasho is a hook arm wrestler, right? I mean, he's extremely good inside. That's what he's known for. And I think Paul Linn can match it.
Engin Terzi: think he can match it not only do i think you know what the interesting thing is that people who top roll he tries to top roll bachelor i know about you the sasha they cannot beat him the people who beat sasha actually are the people who visit him inside i mean at least to to his pronator not not by back pressure more you go back pressure
Engin Terzi: with his supinated side pressure, he hits you and he takes you out of your shoulder. So it is, it looks like, I never pulled him, but in fact, I pulled him when he was 18 years old, but then he was very young. It looks like to attack into his pronator is smarter way than trying to take his hand because you cannot really take his wrist. He gets fully supinated and he has,
Engin Terzi: incredible supinated side pressure hit this way. Incredible. So I don't know which way Paul is going to pull. Sorry for Kathy. You go ahead. Yeah. Like I said, I think Paul knows exactly where to put the pressure. I'm curious about where he's going to attack. I'm curious because he figured out the right way to pull against Rustam only after two rounds, you know, on the third round.
Engin Terzi: went yeah i remember he tried to top roll john he lost badly and then next two rounds he hook him and he was very tough and then he tried to topple rambat he lost and then three rounds in a row he who can beat him in a dominant way so he's he doesn't seem so confident about his hook but i can say that i'm not sure how it's going to happen if he goes there but pauline is
Engin Terzi: probably one of the most explosive top guys in the sports. Very explosive. Whenever I asked John, did you hook him? Did you allow him to hook you? Or he hook you? He said, he hooked me. You know, he just, John, he just, boom. He just turned John inside with that explosive hits. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't really know what's going to happen. Both are incredible. And leaving hints,
Engin Terzi: Thank you for your super chat. Keep up in knowing strength is a mentality. Whatever we feel for others to be great is what is to happen. Congratulations. Thank you for your super chat, Michael. Okay. Okay, let's go to last message.
Adam Wawrzynski: Laletin versus Tobias, Adam. Do you know Tobias? I do. I do. Not very well, but I'm going to give the advantage. I mean, I kind of contradict myself here, but I'm going to give the advantage to him. Tobias, I think that he's just youth explosive. Anytime I have seen him arm wrestle, he's just extremely committed to his move.
Adam Wawrzynski: Um, he fights hard. He doesn't give up. I, and, and Lilletton, uh, you know, we, we know he's pretty well established. I mean, we, there's a lot of things that we, there's not a lot that we don't know about him. Um, you know, I don't know. I don't know. I liked, I liked Tobias, but I don't know. I don't know. Maybe.
Adam Wawrzynski: Maybe 55-45 Laletin. But I like Tobias. I think he has the tools. I think he has the tools to be in that match. Such a young puller. Future hope for our sport. Right, right. He's young. He's up and coming. I like him. But I think Laletin...
Engin Terzi: I like every guy with big dreams. But as long as they are paying the price to reach that dream, not just sitting on couch and dreaming, you know. Right. There's a lot. They need to be paying hard, focused, everything. They need to breathe, you know, their dream. Yes, sir. Anyway, so let's ask to Bacho again about Dave Sheffy and Revaz. I'm sure he knows both of them.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): yeah uh he's saying that uh without uh of the uh doubts rivers will win uh because last time i saw him in person he was in different a different level does she does she live
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): in tbilisi i don't i don't think so he lives in kahiti which is like uh east uh east most east part of the georgia and uh he has also a youtube channel which name is the uh place where he is actually from garage so yeah can you ask him who he is in training with does he ever go to tibet to train with the top guys
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Lately, he has not been in Tbilisi. He's been preparing with his coach training.
Engin Terzi: he's been training he doesn't go and train with those top guys from Georgii no I guess he can't or he doesn't have time or anything he didn't specify a reason he just said lately he hasn't been there okay I understand well he's saying that there was without any doubt he's gonna beat Dave Chaffee yes and how do you see this much other I I like Dave Chaffee um
Adam Wawrzynski: just based on all the recent matches i've seen with both those guys i uh i gotta give the edge to dave except i mean 65 35. this is heavily favored almost yeah i mean rivers is not going to out top roll dave chafee i don't i don't think that's going to happen at all and inside just
Engin Terzi: i think it's a good match don't get me wrong i i just i like dave one of the more confident matches i'm in i i have towards all the matches i think dave's gonna win yeah there are not many people that can beat dave cheffy yeah but for sure rewas is one of those dangerous guys he is yeah i i really can't wait i really don't know i i cannot really see
Engin Terzi: what's happening, you know, they are in strap and reference says go. I don't, I don't know, but most likely they side pressure is gonna move reverse off the center. I don't know how much enough to bring it to the pin path or halfway. I don't know. I really don't know. And who's, who's gonna get exhausted if somehow match stop somewhere. I really don't know.
Engin Terzi: I can't wait. Yeah, I think it's going to be a war, but I think Dave's going to pull it off. Yeah. The guy has the best side pressure, strongest side pressure in the world. For sure. Yeah, yeah. And let's go to the last two matches. Let's see if Bacho is going to favor his country guy or not. But what does he think about Ongarbaev?
Engin Terzi: can you ask him does he does he answers with a little with the patriotic feelings all of those others that i ask
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Not only this matter, I'm not asking specifically Irakli, but him being from Georgii, does it affect his answers or not at all? Bacho, I would like to ask you a question, as you mentioned, about the Georgii. Do you think that your patriotism, your commitment to your country, has changed or has it changed?
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): uh no actually uh even though he's patriot and all the stuff he's saying that he personally knows iraqli how good iraqli is how good cooler and he just believes so that uh he would really yeah can you ask him in which way he is he thinks that iraq is gonna beat him by top roll or
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Possibly press, yeah. But what do you think, what do you think about Irakli? If you can, what do you think about him? How do you feel about him? Of course, I am very happy, how do you feel about him? Thank you. And my opinion about Irakli is very different. My opinion is different.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): he said that as far as i'm concerned they are both outside pullers which obviously is the truth and he said i think just iraqis outside will be superior in that match that's basically what he said so outside with the way will you go and adam how do you see this match uh i disagree i like anger by of just when you look at anger bias explosivity
Adam Wawrzynski: He's very intelligent and he knows exactly when and where to explode and hit in a match. And I actually think that Ongarbaev's wrist is going to hold up a little bit better than Irakli. And I think if Irakli jumps into a press, I think that Ongarbaev is going to know exactly when to surge and keep him out of that press. Mm-hmm.
Adam Wawrzynski: I, um, yeah, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if a Rockley was a little bit better outside. Um, but I, I'm going to give the edge to hunger by not by much, probably, probably 52, 48. Oh, you expect with a close match? I do, but I think that longer vibe is going to win with the technical advantage. I understand you are saying that it actually may be when,
Engin Terzi: stronger more horsepower but you are saying that the control ability on that web may be better yeah i think i think his table iq is better and i think i tell you what his table like you probably better than 99.9 percent than anyone else and if if anyone else is there that they can be only as good as on their web
Engin Terzi: I don't think that you beat that guy because you are smarter than that guy. You really need to dominate that guy. If you play a chess game with him, not many people. I'm not talking about this guy, that guy. But I don't know even if Devon's table IQ is higher than him. I would expect them to have the highest level at the table. But it doesn't mean that Devon cannot beat him or beat him or something, you know.
Engin Terzi: in 115 kg i would give pay uh edge to devon for sure at 105 kilo i would expect very close match very close match if they ever played 105 kg trust me that there will be probably the best chess game that history has ever witnessed and now let's go to the last match let's go to the last match gennady quick mini versus devon larat macho
Engin Terzi: Look at the smile on his face. A type of question. Bacho, do you know Devon? The only Tukagiki I know, Bacho. Look at how he is laughing. I'm joking, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Anubhav Bikrop from Genadi Boy. Dave two to that speaker. Yeah. Yeah. So I asked him, so you think Genadi would win? And yeah, obviously I do. He said he's going to win? Genadi is going to win? Genadi is going to win, yeah. And does he think in which way? His answers are short. We had like more than one hour. The total, you know, of the words, he said probably like 50 maximum.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Yes, okay. Bacho, let's start from the beginning, because it's a very interesting topic, and I want to know what you think about Genadi Bougev. I don't know anything about Genadi, and I don't know what he thinks about me, because I know him very well.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): He knows how good a puller Genadi is. He has been pulled with him. And also, especially right now, he's in better shape than ever. So that's why he's going with Genadi. So I guess he did not specify any styles or anything. He just said that he knows how good a puller Genadi is. So we'll think of something. Let me stir the pot a little bit. Tell him that, you know, Devon said that he needs... He told me to...
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): have medical assistance for Genadi after the match. Does he think that I should need to do something? .
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): it's a yeah he said that it would be devil who would need this medical assistance so yeah you should you should be ready for it don't say the devil would need he they wouldn't be in the medical assistance so yeah okay yeah these georgian guys back each other you know so strong yeah yeah that's how it should be and you adam what do you think about this match i i'm curious to hear from you you're such a smart guy
Adam Wawrzynski: I love the matchup. And, you know, Devon just doesn't know how to lose. You ever notice that? What's that? Devon doesn't know how to lose. Oh, he doesn't know how to lose. It's not that he's so great at winning, but he's really good at not losing.
Adam Wawrzynski: He's really good at it. You are basically saying that he is an incredibly talented defensive puller. He's an incredibly talented defensive arm wrestler. He's the most impressive defensive arm wrestler I have ever seen. Matter of fact, he's probably one of the only arm wrestlers, there might be more, that I can think of that has made a career
Engin Terzi: on winning based on defense. By bleeding his opponent. He's just so good at it. You know what? Not the style the same, but you are on your way also. Not the same style, but like this. You also wait, wait. You know how people talk behind you?
Adam Wawrzynski: uh well but they said that they said that like adam is gonna stop his opponent and look at his own bicep for like half minutes this is how they told you why i mean look i mean the difference between devin and me is you know devin if you have any weakness and it might not be a weakness it just might be your weakest link
Adam Wawrzynski: He's going to find it. He's going to find it, yeah. And he's going to attack that weakest link as hard as he can, and he's going to, and it's, he's, I mean, look, Genadi is just as, I mean, part of me. Basically, you are saying that Genadi is going to lose. This is what you are saying, but go ahead. I want to say that he's going to win because he's so strong and he's so explosive and.
Adam Wawrzynski: But every time I think that somebody can have a chance against Devon, it's just, he just proves time and time and again why he's the best defensive arm wrestler on the planet, except for LeVon. That was a different level. But, no, I don't think. Are you saying that except LeVon, no one can beat Devon? Is what you believe? Kind of.
Adam Wawrzynski: Yeah. Yeah. So you are saying that at some point he's going to stop the opponent and it will be over. This is what you are saying. The only limit, the only limits Devon has is himself. And when I say that, I mean, in terms of health, I mean, I know he's come out and publicly said that he has some tendon and ligament issues, tears here and there. And if he, if a healthy Devon Larratt is on the table,
Engin Terzi: then not many people who's going to beat him unless you're just that much stronger. And right now there's only one guy that's that much stronger. It's Levin. It's Levan. That's it. No one else is strong. Devon also has a match against Dennis. Dennis made a comeback. Of course, it was only beginning, you know, he seriously prepared a few months. But in October, he will have another
Adam Wawrzynski: seven, eight months till October. Dennis, do you think that there is a chance Dennis to beat him or no? Of course. I mean, Dennis is one of those guys who used to be at that strength level, right? That, that was of that. So, I mean, if he can get, if he can get back to that strength level, absolutely. I mean, absolutely. I don't know. It doesn't mean that doesn't mean that,
Engin Terzi: he can beat Devon right arm for sure as well, or it means that he would have a chance to beat Devon? A chance. I don't think for sure. A chance. Because it looks like the way that Dennis is pulling right now is going to allow Devon for sure to stop the match. Yeah. Yeah, and then once the match stops, then even after stopping,
Engin Terzi: either dennis needs to dominate or it is going to be a war long war and then usually that one is good about war then it's not that then it's not bad either but we will see because you are saying that that one is going to be genetic this is what you are saying i do i give it the edge i have to i'd be a full i'd be foolish not to uh i i think devin
Engin Terzi: has the edge right now. He knows how to win. He's going to attack Genadi's weakest link, and he's going to make it a war. Do you believe that Genadi can win in a round? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, Genadi can... But not three rounds, is what you're saying? No, not three. Not three. Yeah. And Roma, can you ask Bacho if Genadi is going to win 3-0?
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): or like there's a chance that we can win in a round. Bacho, what do you think about Devon's and Genadi Shor's relationship? Do you think that Genadi will be able to win against Samit Nor? Or do you think that Devon will have a chance to win against Genadi in a round? I think Samit Nor will be able to win against Genadi, but I think that Genadi will be able to win against me.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): He said that it's more likely for Genadi to win 3-0 than any other shot, like any other score. But for sure, Devon has a chance to win definitely a round. Yeah, for sure, he said. But it's more likely that Genadi will win 3-0. I understand. Anyway, so let's finish. Thank you very, very much, guys. Adam, do you want to say anything
Adam Wawrzynski: more before we end anything to your opponent anything to the people who have been following us i just i just can't wait to see you again my friend you will be honored you had a big color yeah hanging it's i'm i'm so fortunate we all are so fortunate to you know have you doing what you're doing and bringing us all together and i just want to say thank you to every single
Adam Wawrzynski: fan person out there that is supporting east versus west because like you always say this is a this is a big family and at the end of the day we want to lift arm wrestling you know people out there who are trying to break us down pay them no attention
Adam Wawrzynski: We're always going to have people like that. And we just need to continue to elevate this sport. And Engin, you're on the track to do that. And we need to get, we need to all be on board and support each other. So to Bacho, you're impressive, my friend. I hope you're, I know you're training hard. Keep training. And I'm excited to grip up with you on the table come May 6th. I'll quickly translate. Thank you. Thank you, Adam, for your kind words, my friend.

Engin Terzi: G.L.A. opportunities and trust me don't say anything positive, please, you said it enough, but trust me, this is the list of what you guys deserve. Thank you, Sir, thank you.
Roman Tsindeliani (Translator): Bacho, it is a great pleasure to meet you and to meet the people who came to meet you. It is a pleasure to meet you and to meet the people who came to meet you.
