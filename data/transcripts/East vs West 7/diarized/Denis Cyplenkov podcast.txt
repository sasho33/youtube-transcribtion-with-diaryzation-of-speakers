Engin Terzi: Hello. Hello, hello. Not only you have. Yeah, we are live now. Yeah. I mean, I have nothing compared to Dennis anyways. You guys. Okay.
Engin Terzi: Dennis, how are you, my friend? How are you, Bob Ken? Good. Everything is fine. Good. That's good. How is Dubai going? Are you doing rally? Not now. Rally, yes, on Saturday we do it. Enjoy too much. That's good. Rally, how? On Saturday.
Engin Terzi: very good yeah that's good enjoy yes enjoy yeah i'm happy i'm happy and and it hasn't been so long it has been how long it has been only like what 10 days not even 10 yeah 10 days yeah and how is he feeling he's still training and uh yeah and you know i will uh tell something uh
Denis Cyplenkov: only today we start or yesterday we feel little good because uh uh change you know places and change uh weather yes here is a very difficult period was been for uh to buy people too for us is normal because we are in from russia uh three days they came in grain without stop
Denis Cyplenkov: and people are not comfortable and Denis' blood pressure is going up a little bit. He's not feeling good. Only yesterday and today we're feeling better. But now I hope our training will be going good and we will see which type will be Denis in 25.
Denis Cyplenkov: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What do we have? Exactly 25 days. Today is 31st. Yes, yes. Three and a half weeks. And how long more is he going to train? Denis, how long more are you going to train? Until 18. We have a plan about this, yes.
Denis Cyplenkov: last training we will do in 18 yes we talked yesterday is he gonna do any table training yeah of course we're doing uh each uh week one time uh we do uh
Denis Cyplenkov: And Tuesday we do it first after Istanbul, after 2U, when we came. Yes, Wednesday we do it, training with belt and with elastic, we train together. Yes, some training moments we prepare. Yes, and...
Denis Cyplenkov: next one this will be sunday our plans to make our the training table training yeah and and then it's the last one week you're gonna do i mean until the last one week you're gonna do only weightlifting right you're not gonna do any table time one week before you mean last week uh before matches
Denis Cyplenkov: I mean, you said that he's going to train till 18th, but he's not going to do table training there, right? You can ask him. Yes, of course, we will do it. Table time? One week before? Yes, last in 18 would be. And then he will do table training? Yes, with heavyweights and...
Denis Cyplenkov: on the table too yeah dennis dennis sounds very young and healthy to do that today we're first day we go to the pool uh to uh swim little bit under the sun little bit like this is it hot in dubai
Engin Terzi: now 22 like this not too much but for us it's perfect comfortable yes too much comfortable no i understand so dennis uh it was 2008 and john lost a super match against devon and then five weeks later he came to the lottery and he beat you
Engin Terzi: And now five weeks before the event, he lost against Irakli. And now he has another five weeks. Do you think that there is a possibility, the same scenario to happen again? You may say that you are at that time, you were very young in experience in 2008, but also today you are not in your really, really top form.
Denis Cyplenkov: So how do you see this? In 2008, Devon had a super match in England.
Denis Cyplenkov: John lost. But five weeks later, he came to the Lofty Church and he beat Dennis. And I'm just saying that even now that he lost against Irakli. Yeah. Now he has five weeks. Yeah. Before he fought with you, he lost a few weeks ago. And what do you think? He also lost now.
Engin Terzi: The question is that there is something like that. Does he think that there is no way that same thing can repeat this time? That's what I want to hear.
Engin Terzi: is an opinion you can you can tell him you can tell him that maybe i am trying to steal the pot a little bit yeah
Denis Cyplenkov: John knows his way. This is his way. And that's why maybe he knows something. Yeah, yeah. So he takes John very seriously, right? He's very dangerous.
Denis Cyplenkov: Yes, he don't think so. He's a loser. Technically, he's the winner, of course. Of course, he's dangerous about... John is known to be...
Engin Terzi: shocking the arm wrestling world, you know, John, John in very unexpected times can do very interesting things that he would make us, you know, wow, he did it again, you know, so I see that John is underdog. Dennis is the favorite one here, but, but I, I somehow cannot think that, you know, like, like John doesn't have chance at all. I don't, I don't think that way.
Engin Terzi: And can you ask him, yeah, can you ask him, in the past, Dennis was more like, you know, holding low and more like side pressure and hook, and now he's using more of a pronator. Against John, the way that he pulls now is better than his past, you know, in the past in his prime, the hook type of moving. How does he see against John Brzezinski?
Engin Terzi: like his newer uh pulling style i mean he has pulled in the past as well but now it looks like you know he's like specifically main technique is using the pronation control and how does he see the difference
Babken Melikyan: And how do you think, how will you control him? No, I'm not going to do it on the spot. In any case, if everyone remembers, I always, after he lost, told him that when I was already preparing for him, I had time, I had already started. That is, the first time I ran into him, I was inexperienced. Well, I did it wrong.
Denis Cyplenkov: first time when he lose he haven't experienced enough and that's why he do mistakes with John and that's why he go inside like this after that after losing two losings yes he prepared little bit the other kind of his style
Engin Terzi: And of course, now he will try to control not inside. More like more. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. But before, like, I mean, after John made a comeback, we thought that his arm strength was very good, but he had some problems with his hands. But in the last match against Iraq, Iraq is a very explosive
Engin Terzi: and when john and iraqi hit outside john had the hand you know and iraqi lost his wrist does it concern dennis because he actually won that match by bringing his shoulder and shoulder pressing and while we know that we never seen dennis doing such thing you know does he have any concern that what if john puts
Engin Terzi: Deniz, of course, Deniz is much stronger than Irakli, but we need to understand that Irakli is also more explosive than Deniz. So when, when John has enough time to apply his power, John is very strong. So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So what I'm saying, yeah, John, John top role in Irakli, you know, controlling, uh,
Denis Cyplenkov: Did it worry Denis at all or what does he think about all this?
Denis Cyplenkov: Yes, of course, we know and he is moving. Of course, he will try to open what how we can. Of course, it's stable will show how it's impossible to do this. And can you ask him what how, like on the percentage?
Engin Terzi: How does he see his chance against John? Wow, that's interesting. Is he being realistic or humble?
Babken Melikyan: i think he is humble i don't know ask him i want to hear from him is
Denis Cyplenkov: yeah he will feel not uh comfortable because long time he haven't experienced about uh yes real matches is competing in events you know after pool it's not mean you know it's or training is different and that's why he's not poor and uh
Denis Cyplenkov: We will see how it's possible to do. Yeah, so it means that he's feeling a little bit nervous and excited. Yeah, because we travel too much and now and his weight is the same like one year, two years before, sometimes going down. When I checked his weight, he was 124, 125 kilos. Yes, the same now. Sometimes, yes, it's less.
Denis Cyplenkov: one two kilograms he has an incredible metabolism you know just how he can keep himself he's just totally gripped you know everywhere arms everything he's totally and he's 40 years old right yes yes genetic uh it's genetic yeah it's interesting very interesting yeah so yeah I understand I think it's we want to change climate you know for him it's very important to be in
Denis Cyplenkov: In near house, training, you know, everything. He prepare every moments about eating, sleeping. Here we try to do this. How much we need it for until events, we will see. It will be good or not. And when exactly he competed last time? Last time, it was Devon, right? Yes.
Engin Terzi: With Devon in 2018. With Devon, Larad. Okay. Left hand. Yeah, I understand, yeah. And then it has been near five years then. Yeah, four and a half years, yeah. I understand. Let's see, let's see. I can't wait to see him at the table.
Engin Terzi: And after I saw, I get to know Dennis closer. I mean, it is impossible to not to be fan of him. The guy is so respectful, so realistic, so honest. As I say, like whatever he talks privately. And then when somebody asks something on press conference, he is not political. He's just straight, same day.
Denis Cyplenkov: Same thing he's saying. And he's such a cool guy. Fortunately, we have someone like Dennis. Thank you. And we are thinking the same about you. It's your kindness. You do the best. How we discuss about everything, we fix it and we decide very easily.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah with people our words this is important for us yeah yeah yeah yeah that's how the relationship is built you know whatever you talk you are behind it yeah yes yes yes yes yes anyway so uh so this guy is gonna go outside against john and john is gonna go outside
Engin Terzi: And then we got to say, yeah, I can't wait. You know, they both will be crushed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And he's not be going climbing up. You know, he normally holds a little bit like low, you know, and then do his moments. I think I think that people many people are thinking that Dennis is going to crash John. I kind of don't see that Dennis.
Engin Terzi: may win and he's favorite but i don't see somehow full domination i i i expect a very very unfortunate but very very good match unforgettable match you know and i don't know we will see like whenever i ask dennis uh he said what did he say he say he's 60 percent yes now the same you were in four weight though we do the same now
Engin Terzi: because because one week one week or 10 days you wasted while trying to get used to dubai right yeah yes now with the last day and after sunday now we're feeling it's good normal yeah yeah yeah and and can you ask him you know he's gonna be around like 70 percent of the match on the match today
Babken Melikyan: Yes, he feels now he's 17, it's maybe close. Now? On the competition day? Now even? Oh, okay.
Engin Terzi: And on competition day, he will be even higher form? Yes, yes, he hope. He hope, yeah? Okay. Okay. So, the question, if we judge by the percentages, you know, John is, where do you think John is right now? Maybe 85% of his best, probably? Yeah? How he came...
Denis Cyplenkov: You know, with Irakli, he has good shape, but a little bit something not going in 100%, yes. Because if he last matches, we see he lose his power, you know. Not first two matches, three, it's going good, very good. And we hope, yes.
Engin Terzi: yeah john will come about john's like prime time when he was like 35 years old so compared to when he was 35 years old he's probably now 85 90 percent of his best so but but dennis is about 70 so we need to make like a like like 85 percent of john's best versus probably 75 80 percent of
Engin Terzi: Yeah, that's right. Go close. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then, you know, when we consider the really prime Dennis, he was very, very strong. So it is like, I mean, I don't think that I don't think that I don't think that like people should underestimate John. Let's see. Let's see. There will be some other matches as well. And
Engin Terzi: There will be Hermes versus Levan. How do you see this match? And how does Denis see? What do you think about the match between Levan and Hermes? Well, it will be very difficult for Hermes. Of course. Hermes will be too much difficult. Oh, the match will be difficult for Hermes? Yes, yes. Yeah.
Denis Cyplenkov: In my opinion, I will tell, he has a chance, of course, a good chance. In his moving, it's very strong. All the time we talk about this. His top role is about working with wrist moments. It's very top, top level.
Denis Cyplenkov: yes and that's why i hope uh his uh now shape it will be enough uh to stop little if he stopped levan he he couldn't like this he have chance if he don't stop if he lose his position like uh with uh jeffy last time yes uh lebanon will be he will use all his body
Denis Cyplenkov: don't we have to don't forget about this because he's 200 approximately kg it's not joke and he will uh and Levan use very good my my my take is um right now Levan is favorite against anyone he is very heavily favorite not only against Hermes but anyone
Denis Cyplenkov: But if you, right now, as of now, if you would choose someone to pull against Levan, like who has the highest chance, as of now, I would put Hermes there. You understand? If I had a chance. Yes, I see really, I'm not joking and I don't think like this because he's in my team like this. But really, I believe Zaur,
Engin Terzi: have a very good chance to beat lebanon don't you think it is a little bit more time like when i say like a little bit more time i'm talking about like the zaur has been pulled so many uh world level really like top five level super matches he didn't pull yet so i think that you know it would be better
Denis Cyplenkov: If he starts somewhere and gets used to more endurance, then he will be good. Zaur had a lot of work before the matches in Lebanon. He had to work. That's why I say now. Now it's the Hermes. Yes, of course. Just now, it's Hermes. It's really his place. In his place.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah. If anyone right now deserves to pull against Levan, it's Hermes. It's proven. After his victory against Dave Sheffield, Dave Sheffield is a superhuman being, and Hermes beat him 3-0. We cannot say that Hermes dominated him, but still he didn't lose any rounds. He proved, of course, he proved his places. And he's not... He's...
Denis Cyplenkov: Very hard for him, but he decided. For him, for his mentality, it's difficult. And if you know how to change the matches with Jerry, it has to be a competition. After one month or how many days before you change the cheffy against... It was one month before. Yes, and that's why it's...
Engin Terzi: He do his job in one month. He prepare a little bit. I think he was already prepared, you know, because three weeks ago he had his Laletin match. Three weeks ago he was in super shape. And then three weeks later he recovered. Yeah. Yeah. I mean about Hermes. Hermes. Yeah. Oh, yeah. He had to change his style from Jerry to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There is a super shit Levan Sergeyevich's liver.
Engin Terzi: Thank you for your super chat. Denis' opinion about Morozov versus Hermes. He looks future now. You're talking about Morozov, I think he says. Denis, what do you think they're asking you? Morozov or Hermes wins right now? At the moment, I think it's Hermes or... Or, maybe, Ertem Morozov. The best of both worlds? Yes.
Denis Cyplenkov: First of all, he wants to see matches with Levan Hermes. After that, we can talk about something else. We know Artyom's shape is relaxed. He doesn't prepare and that's why.
Denis Cyplenkov: Last year, you gave him many opportunities to fight. That's why this period for him is like a pause. In one year, the experience that he gained is more than all his life.
Engin Terzi: And he will be here part of the East versus West. I'm not going to say his opponent in May. And it will be a good one, you know. Let's see. And then let's focus on the king of the table. That is, I mean, like, incredible event. Like, Levan versus Hermes is to find out
Engin Terzi: the number one guy in the world. And then Dennis versus John is like, you can put in anywhere, but most likely in a super legend category match, you know, and people are like very, very excited to, you know, uh, see these matches. And I hope, I hope, I hope everyone is gonna use this opportunity because, um, sometimes the things look like, you know,
Engin Terzi: One side is heavily favorites. But before the matches, who would say that, like, I just made polls. Like when Gabriela was pulling against the girl, Barbara. And the polls were like 90% Gabriela, 10% Barbara. But you never know, you know. It was 2-0 and then came back from there and then won. So always, there are always surprises. When John versus Irakli, John had like maybe
Engin Terzi: 85% on the polls. And then like whenever I said Dave Chaffee versus Morozov, Dave Chaffee was right here on the polls. So nobody expected Morozov to win, but he won. So what I'm just saying that this is the beauty, beauty of our message, that the things may be different. Who knows, like imagine that, I'm not saying it's going to happen, but just imagine that we wake up next day
Denis Cyplenkov: It would be very interesting day for Armesty. And you know, this is a specific moment about our fight. Six matches, five matches. This is really unbelievable. And nobody
Denis Cyplenkov: even high specialists they couldn't give correct end of any matches some matches yeah yeah yeah even sometimes we all of mistakes really it's and that's why we love it this sport and that's why you know give us emotions yeah I agree yeah
Engin Terzi: anyway so if we talk more about dennis dennis said that right now he's he feels even 70 is what is like he right now he doesn't want to talk anything further than john and then he gives 50 to john 50 to himself and because
Engin Terzi: he physically probably feels good but he also feels nervous while john made a comeback about one and a half year ago it's crazy that john had all those long matches in one and a half year he was like 2021 july he made a comeback till the january 2023 which is one and a half years it's crazy that to think about how many super matches this guy had yeah yeah yeah and yeah and then while
Engin Terzi: Dennis didn't pull for very near, like more than three years, almost four years he didn't pull. Yeah, four years and two months or something. He was end of 2018, I think. Anyway, so yeah. And that is the reason that Dennis is thinking that he is not the favorite because he thinks that, you know, he needs more time. Yeah, more time. Yeah.
Denis Cyplenkov: And you know, for us it's like an adventure, this hour coming, and we don't want to say no for you, and we come to Turkey after we decide to come here. This traveling, this change places, for him it's more discomfort for his mentality, because this is very important for him, to be at home, training near home,
Denis Cyplenkov: and not far from, you know. His mind has to be everything in his place like this. I understand. He doesn't like changes. Yeah, yes, he doesn't. Even last week, I pushed him to buy a new iPhone. He said, no, no, mine is good. All this is very good. He got used to the phone. He doesn't want to do anything new yet.
Engin Terzi: I'm telling you, such a playing guy, you know, the guy is just like, he just, I mean, he finds his way and then he likes to follow that way. And Denis, do you have the tools that you need for training in Dubai? Well, let's put it this way. This is the first time I'm in a situation where I have to train
Denis Cyplenkov: in another country. It's not clear to me. The first time he's doing like this, for me it's not understandable because he changed the area about training. The only thing is that I have the equipment at home, so I can do something at any time. Yes, and he has some weights in his house.
Denis Cyplenkov: because he training specific and any time he can go near these weights and to get it and to do this. Lift or something like this. So did this kind of change in Dubai? Yeah, we have opportunity many places, even in hotel we have gym, of course, but you know, home at home,
Denis Cyplenkov: And, you know, everything is, you know, handmade, something like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So he didn't bring any kind of the small... Yeah, he brings some handles. He brings. But the Strong Gym have many handles, too. And in Binu's gym, we will go...
Engin Terzi: this week too and i think we will find there too i understand yeah there is a there is a super chef aaron his name i think levan will jerry cadarets hermes if he loses his hand a lot of georgians we saw at the east versus west one we did that this press good luck at all so he says that
Engin Terzi: Even if Hermes takes Levan's wrist, the guy is saying that Levan will still beat him with the dead wrists. And he said that at the East versus West, they saw the many Georgii with dead wrists. They were, he's talking about Arabuli and he's talking about, so he says that even if Hermes takes Levan's wrist, Levan will still beat him.
Engin Terzi: But you saw Levan, he do like this one time. You saw this? I mean, in fact, the truth is I didn't see. If you ask before the match, if John would purely top roll, you know, Irakli every round, I wouldn't think that that would be that easy. I mean, it wasn't easy, but he got the control. But if you would ask me, if John takes Irakli's everything,
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I could beat him like this. I will say impossible. You're dreaming. Yeah, but it happened. Yeah, yeah, but it happened. So what I'm just saying now, when you ask me if I ever seen Levan do this, I didn't see Iraqi doing either, but he did it. So everything is possible. Can you ask Dennis, Dennis, if Aramis
Denis Cyplenkov: Does he think that Levan can beat him with a dead wrist? I mean, against an opponent? If even Hermes opens his wrist to Levan, Levan will go inside with a triceps and so on. What do you think, will he go like that? Maybe so, considering that now Irakli is already like that too, probably the Georgii guys
Denis Cyplenkov: Yes, and he said Levan doesn't have enough angles and he has a big weight. For him, it's not comfortable to change his movement and his angle. So, he's thinking that if Hermes takes the wrist, Hermes is going to win? If Hermes takes the wrist and Levan holds it, does he have a chance to win?
Denis Cyplenkov: maybe threats of snow but in uh side sideways inside pressure yes he will go with his weight go down i understand here possibilities like this yeah george west coast hanging belly what kind of nickname is that hanging out with dennis swedco you are most accurate in addition here
Engin Terzi: um the guy is asking what does uh dennis think about zaur versus swedco but he already expressed that you know he wants to talk about the thing of the table but i don't know you can ask or whatever
Unknown: It will be interesting, I think. Yes, it will be interesting. Interesting, yeah. Okay. And then Neil Pickup is asking, what does Dennis think about this weekend, Sandris versus Devon Laras? What do you think about Sandris? It will be Laras soon. I think
Denis Cyplenkov: Larod will win, of course. I think Larod will win. And Larod won years before. Now it's different, very different. Yeah. Now he changes many moments about training camp, system of preparing, everything he changes. He's getting much stronger. Yes, stronger.
Denis Cyplenkov: I think it is because of the haircut he had in Turkey. Yes, yes. You know about this, I love too much. How you do it, yes. I give you medal, specially give you medal. Yes, of course, I say. I write to him too to talk about this.
Engin Terzi: yeah i asked him if he likes surprises and he said he loves surprise i said the surprise i'm gonna do you are not gonna like it and then i put him i i told his friend you know sean i said can you just start filming you know and then he started filming everything i'm gonna post the rest of it uh soon yeah and yeah let's i i do that
Denis Cyplenkov: do the same, you know, but I think maybe maybe Judy will be accepted, but you will be alone. You don't think you do it. Yeah. He told me to shave the hair here and then leave it here. And I said, Are you sure? And he said, Yeah, yeah. Judy loves it. I think Judy, he don't want to
Engin Terzi: they won't be more beautiful. That's the only possibility. He said that Kody would be very happy and I said Kody would be very happy only because other women wouldn't like you anymore. Kody, don't worry. He's a very good husband. Yeah, yeah. I don't know about that one.
Engin Terzi: He knows better. Yeah. Okay. So let's talk more. What is he like most concerned about John Brzezinski? Like what does the biggest part that would worry Dennis about John?
Denis Cyplenkov: You mean about in-fight time? Yeah, yeah, yeah. During, like, about his match with John Brzenk, what part of John's abilities or anything, you know, about John that worries Denis? The worst scenario is that you're at the table and you can't imagine what John could have done or what you're afraid of.
Denis Cyplenkov: I think only one thing about injury. He will be enough endurance in matches. Denis is talking about his endurance? No, about John's endurance.
Denis Cyplenkov: no but i'm talking about what what is the most dangerous part with john not not the what is the problem which is
Denis Cyplenkov: Of course, he understands what he wants to do. He will try to open his wrist. And, of course, he will try to do everything to... It will not happen like this. So, what Denis is saying that
Engin Terzi: the key point for Dennis to win this match to not to lose his hand and wrist. This is what he's saying. Yeah. Yeah. And then one of the one of the guys who are watching the who's watching the this program, he's asking if Dennis do the strict cure anymore. Sit only when when he sit, but not in state.
Denis Cyplenkov: Okay, he does it when he is sitting on his knees? Yes. And can you ask him how much did he do? One month before he last time do this and approximately 110 kilograms.
Denis Cyplenkov: 110 kilo. It's one rep? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let me try to... Yeah, they are asking about the shape of Dadikan there. Yes, the Dadikan shape is now he prepared about his injury. He broke his left hand a little bit.
Denis Cyplenkov: uh because when he have competition with alec he lose his weight he have endurance after pulling you have arm fight with uh rudnik and after this he feeling very not good not comfortable
Denis Cyplenkov: we prepare uh some making some procedures and after that we do two three uh training short and after that we have with Artyom much of course uh after that yeah he have more endurance he broke little bit uh he sent not broke but you know from elbow have big big problems
Denis Cyplenkov: And now he's preparing. How about right arm? Is right arm not good at the push? Right arm, because you know, he don't, long time he don't training. And he start one, two weeks before, slowly, step by step, to make some exercise, arm wrestling, especially exercise. He try, he start to do this.
Denis Cyplenkov: And we have, yes, one time with Devon, with Denis, he had practice. He's feeling normal, but it's, you know, it's depending when he will start, he have not huge form, of course, and feelings, not 100%. He have some endurance moment, injury moment, but
Denis Cyplenkov: we will uh you know we'll fix uh maybe after maximum one month we will understand the left hand or right hand we will prepare uh most likely summer huh yes summer but your event which time will be in august or i have one in one in one in may and then maybe end of july or something the other one
Engin Terzi: Yes, it will be good. This time it will be good. Another question I want to ask Denis. After he put his, or maybe he didn't put, but the other guy, what was the other guy's name? The YouTuber guy? He does incredible videos. Was his channel True Power? Yes, Andreev, True Jim, True Power. I was asking, I know Andreev, but the channel name was True Power, right?
Engin Terzi: yeah they guys doing incredible job it's just like super high quality yeah videos he's making yeah it's incredible and after he posted the videos training videos and people started to think about like
Engin Terzi: you know he was like winning and then some later Dennis stop him like can you ask you know because people are talking about that can you ask Dennis like if he right now would pull against Zaur if Zaur was in good shape how would be a super match be resulting right as of now not not for the future but now
Denis Cyplenkov: You couldn't explain because it's depending from many facts factor.
Denis Cyplenkov: That's why it's... Hard to answer. Yes, hard. Because you have to change, prepare, it's a style like this, many things. Training camp. And we know we don't risk too much now. We slowly, step by step, training.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, with normal good shape without, you know, nothing for such. We don't do it. I understand. I understand. Yeah. I mean, I personally love to see Dennis at the table again, and I hope that he's going to come to the level that he used to be and he will be great. One guy wrote here that Dennis doesn't like to be far from the home.
Engin Terzi: And he says the American pullers travel to Istanbul to compete, but here I think Dennis is talking about the preparation time not not. yeah I think the guy did not send us so he he just made that comment anyway so. yep and then let's talk more about so he says that he's mostly worried that john will attack to his hands and then.
Denis Cyplenkov: if he protects his hand and wrist? And does he think that his endurance right now would be better than John's endurance? Do you think that if he attacks and you hold him, you will have enough endurance to hold him? Who? The other guy? John. No, John. Antonov. I didn't say anything about that. About endurance. Well done. It's about endurance.
Engin Terzi: i think that's why he's not sure we will see endurance how would be enough uh with john in the matches which we'll see he's not sure yeah there is one guy here asking if if he beats john who does he want to pull next um he he wants to focus to
Denis Cyplenkov: his next match first, not for the future. But the one guy just asking, if he doesn't want to answer, it's okay. We talk about this, you forget.
Engin Terzi: sometimes you forget okay you are super honest person you are super honest person but come on man
Engin Terzi: sometimes i need to present so i ask him what he wants to who he wants to pull and then he said and then he said that and we talked about this did you forget right i can't i can't say everything this is a pain question
Babken Melikyan: I know who he wants to pull. I know what the sentiment is. You should never say that. Now people are going to ask me.
Engin Terzi: we have negotiation about next matches with organizers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now he said that, he said that Engin, you forget about it already, we talk. And now I will see a lot of messages will come to me. Who is going to pull next? Who is going to pull next? And I will act like, I don't know.
Engin Terzi: I don't know. My nose will be growing up like this. Okay, I don't know anything. See, they're already asking Engin who is next for him. I have no idea, no idea. Yeah, okay, okay, okay. Yeah, it will be great year. I think, in my opinion, Babken, this year, 2023,
Engin Terzi: If nothing bad happens, looks like, looks like it's gonna be the best year of the arm wrestling history. This is how I think, yeah. Yeah, yes and we, we do the best my friend. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And the good thing is that as a community we are like this. Of course. Yeah, that's good, that's good, yeah. Anyway, so there is ...
Engin Terzi: There is Silky Wilkie. Thank you for your support, my friend. Thank you very much. And then Brian Lee. How does Dennis feel? Oh, this is a good question. Thank you for your super chat. How does Dennis feel about Ali Can versus Dadik Can? We normally, we need to talk about the king of the table, but this is a super chat. The guy, you know, pays to ask this question.
Engin Terzi: But left hand or right hand? Left hand, left hand, yeah. But we need to admit that this 95 kilo guy is an impressive guy, right? Yeah, of course. Very impressive. Very impressive guy. I kind of thought that Oleg Petrenko was going to seriously beat him, especially the round one whenever he attacked and then he hit the pronator of Petrenko. So if he's saying like this, I was like, okay, I think he's going to hit the wall because there is 10 kilo difference.
Engin Terzi: and I don't know, but he somehow he did this way, this way, he bring his shoulder this way, and he exhausted Oleg Petrenko. So we are asking if in 115 kilo, if Oleg Jan versus Petrenko, or do you think that there is any possibility, not like 102 kilo like Oleg Zok, but 105 kilo, no possible, right? Impossible that he can triple.
Engin Terzi: Now, no, my friend. Really, for him, it's too hard. 150 kilos, right? 115. Yes, yes. Yeah. And he will be a little bit too heavy for Ali Can. He's 95 kilos. But how do you see that match? Can you ask Denis if there is any chance Ali Can has? What do you think about Ali Can and Davit? If it's a left-handed match.
Engin Terzi: It will be a great match. You don't know who will win exactly, but it will be a very great match. Yeah, that is the part that I love about tennis. That tennis gives the respect and credit that when people deserve, you know.
Engin Terzi: Just because Dadikyan is his training partner, he doesn't see anyone small, you know, he just like... Yeah, I'm telling you, I shouldn't say it to his face, but this guy is a great guy, really. Tell Denis that I'm his fan. Thank you.
Engin Terzi: i am a fan of his arm wrestling but more fan of his personality thank you thank you brother yeah yeah it will be it will be great each month in dubai
Denis Cyplenkov: i just can't wait you know i just can't wait and we're waiting you we're waiting you you wait for me should i come of course yeah but dennis if i come i will be at the corner of john no problem and we have the other world but tell him is that is that okay
Denis Cyplenkov: For real. I see. It's okay. It's okay. It's for us. Now, it was 50-50, now 51 John, 49 you. Good. And you forget we have the other job. We have to be corner in Hermes.
Engin Terzi: You forget? Oh, only if Hermes gives me 20% of his money, you know. Otherwise, uh-uh. And then after he says yes... Hermes, guilty, very guilty guy. Hermes, guilty guy. You know, I'm joking. Devon't wait for him. You know, it's just for fun, you know. I'm just joking, yeah.
Engin Terzi: I like to steal the pot, you know. After I get 20% offer from Hermes, I will go Levan. Levan, 25? Yeah, it would be nice. Yeah, maybe I should come. Maybe I should come, yeah. I don't know. I'm like, there is some like a wedding that I need to go. I told to Daniel this as well.
Engin Terzi: but it will be incredible. And they already announced the third match or not yet? They didn't announce, yeah? No, no. Only four. Only two matches now. Two matches they announced and then the third match soon they will announce. Yeah. It will be big fun. It will be big fun, yeah. And so, and he said that he knows, he said that I know he's
Engin Terzi: uh next match uh remember you know he said did you forget that we talked and about that match i'm not gonna give the name so you guys who are following the uh chat don't um by the way yeah thank you jp thank you for sharing the paper ruling guys get your pay-per-view this will be probably the most
Engin Terzi: historical arm wrestling event ever you know and so about his future uh guy that he wants to pull if if he beats uh john uh how does he predict his shape to be which level he says now is 70 probably he will be 75 when he pulled john and then about the next one
Babken Melikyan: Which most likely will be in October. What does he think that his shape will be? Percentage till that time. What percentage do you think will be in October? What percentage do you think will be in October? What percentage do you think will be in October?
Babken Melikyan: It's hard to comment. Of course, I would like to go home. 90-100. It's been half a year since I started working. I think it's real, but how will it help my health? How the health is, he was let in. He went, of course, at 90-100 percentage, but
Engin Terzi: correctly he couldn't uh he cannot say already he will leave and see how he will be yeah i i i i wish him uh healthy and you know the best preparation best preparation yeah yeah thank you i thank you guys yeah anyway so it has been uh one hour and let me see if there is
Engin Terzi: the fans' questions. Do you guys, I mean, you guys want to ask something while Dennis here asks? And okay, if there's a positive sentiment, Deepak with John. One guy is asking if there is any possibility, like just, okay, let me ask that way. A little bit change the question. If somehow Dennis goes outside and just John just say that controls him, is there any plan B?
Denis Cyplenkov: Okay, so that plan A needs to work. There is no other way.
Engin Terzi: You have Plan Q. What do you mean? He will bite him. He will bite him. Plan Q. Okay. Yeah, okay. Okay, so that's interesting. So he is only depending on his new style and then it won't work. It didn't work, no Plan B. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: know that's interesting because in the past when he was pulling push car he was pulling that way he was going outside and then he always had something but that's interesting to hear that now he has only this okay can you ask him how come he became an outside puller totally outside instead of the uh dennis that we remember that was holding and dragging people how come that he became
Babken Melikyan: How did you come to this movement? Well, when I lost to him, I came to this movement. In general, your style has changed. It has nothing to do with John. Well, in principle, it probably started from the moment when I fought, I thought that my biceps were stronger. When I lost to John, I began to train pull-ups and began to rebuild.
Denis Cyplenkov: He started to change after he lost John, because before he thought he had good biceps and inside pressure like this, but after that he understood he had to change something and he tried to change his style.
Denis Cyplenkov: He tried to top roll after... But even after he lost John, he was still doing some hooks, you know. Sometimes when, yes, yes, when he feels it's going, of course he will do it. Depending from feelings.
Denis Cyplenkov: And right now, he doesn't trade at all? Yes, because before, if going outside, it's working. If not, he goes inside. But now, he tries to do more top run against top run. More top run, and it's working, so he wants to continue that way.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. And there is one super chat, Silky Wilkie. Thank you, my friend. I had chance to win down in Australia, but now Ryan has become so big. I have Ryan in my head, engaging his vectors all over the talk board. Okay. Thank you for your super chat, my friend. Okay. Let's see if another...
Engin Terzi: Good question. Okay, maybe match with Ermes May six. Is this true? Dennis didn't pull any afterpulls in Istanbul. He didn't have any afterpulls. Most of the guys were very tired and he didn't have any. Maybe with Arif Ertem he would be training. I don't know how we
Engin Terzi: forget about that one because the other guys killed each other uh also too much he had a long match with ferret but kennedy maybe he could pull but and john also had super hard match yeah we couldn't do anything anything after for dennis you know there was no way i was i was i was
Denis Cyplenkov: I was the only one who was fresh, but I didn't want to make Denis look bad, so we didn't pull that one either. And that's why we are waiting. Igor, it's just that after our fights, everyone was tired, but it wasn't the only one. I was the only one who was tired, so I fought.
Engin Terzi: yeah they're they're they're asking him his after pool with morozo in dubai in dubai morozo had left arm super match and then i talked with morozo i said morozo like what happened with dennis next day maybe it's more we do we go to the bottom
Engin Terzi: now with the left arm left arm here the supermatch okay well right arm i said what happened he said like he feel like it's okay with the right arm without the strap and then he said with strap he said i feel so strong and then i go and then whenever i go my risk goes back with with dennis you know he said that you know dennis was very very strong and at that time when i asked dennis what is your
Engin Terzi: shape he was saying 50 i remember at that time and now dennis is talking about 70 percent and being even 75 percent so 75 percent is the 50 percent more than 50 percent like half of the 50 is 25 so it is it is like much stronger now so then it gives us some idea because whenever i saw dennis in istanbul when he came when devon was there
Engin Terzi: he was okay, was okay. But now when I saw him last time, like his hand and everything, he looked incredible. So that part makes me confused about John's chance. And then whenever I think about John, John is John, you know, so you can underestimate. Yes, and you know what is depending from style too. And if you know, Artyom, he's...
Denis Cyplenkov: after pull he don't pulling good with everybody he's don't give hundred percent he don't uh use all his uh power yeah of course then his hand is not comfortable for uh
Engin Terzi: not only the head but probably the grenade you know because he said he was holding whenever he was going his lips was going back this is what he told me i didn't see any video them pulling but he said he said dennis was very strong yeah that's what he told me yeah let's see asking about the open top roll we have seen him using open now do you do you see they can tire john with his topple i think that that's his plan my friend he already said it
Engin Terzi: They are also asking if Denis is more focusing on his right arm than his left arm. But as far as I know, his left arm is injured. Yes. Yeah, his left arm is injured, right? Yes, of course. And he don't training. Sometimes, yes, we little bit give.
Engin Terzi: Power, but not usually. Okay, there is one guy is asking here, who is the huge guy in Denis' gym videos? Is he a professional armwrestler? Which one? I don't know, is he talking about Kirill Sarchev? Yes, sometimes Kirill come to the gym, Denis. Yes, he make training. Denis teach him a little bit.
Engin Terzi: yeah you may experience and go back in dubai you said that you are gonna do table training with the rubber bands together with dennis does dennis also think to train with anyone from dubai as well or no there are some some some guys there some guys yes with me and one guys from uh strong jim is uh he's a referee in king of the table bulgarian guys
Denis Cyplenkov: Okay. But you don't feel even I can press him more. So, Denis is not planning to really train with anyone else, except you, together with Rafa? No, we don't need, my friend. You don't need. Okay, I understand. Because we know what we want. We know how we have to do. That's all.
Engin Terzi: And then you know which direction he needs to pull. And then, yeah, you do it as a trainer. Yeah, I understand. And did Dennis hear or you, Babken, did you hear the Olympic Committee announcement about the Russian athletes? Like, if you just check from the Google, three days ago, Olympic Committee turned green lights for the Russian athletes to compete
Engin Terzi: went to the 2024 Paris Olympics, but not by representing Russia or not by representing the Russian flag, but as a national athlete. And they already gave them an opportunity to pull in Asian Games or something. And you guys heard? You guys didn't hear about that? No, no, we have information. We have block out here. We don't... You don't check the news. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: And then a few more questions and we can finish. Does Denis believe that there is anyone under 115 kg that can beat Devon Laras, 115 kg? Does he think that Ongar Buev has a chance against Devon?
Unknown: And what do you think about the match with Devon against Ongarbaev? It will be interesting. Very interesting. And Kydyrgali made all the effort to prepare well. He is disciplined. But there is a chance that his tenacity is good.
Denis Cyplenkov: Of course, when Ongarbaev prepares himself and he has enough endurance, he has a chance. But I think Devon has more endurance and he can beat.
Engin Terzi: So then Devon is the favorite against Ongarbaev. And on the press conference, he said that Ongarbaev has the tools to beat Michael. Did that match go as he expected, Denis expected?
Denis Cyplenkov: Basically, I said that he would do everything to win. I understood that Michael Todd was in his position. That's why I said that Kader Ghali should win. It's how we talked before. With most of us, the endurance and angles, he will be enough to beat Todd.
Denis Cyplenkov: And also everyone knows his thought style in his positions. That's why nothing new. But he says that Ongarbaev doesn't have a chance to beat Devon. I think that he doesn't have a chance against Devon. Ongarbaev?
Denis Cyplenkov: Denis is now imagining. If they stay, who have more endurance, of course, Devon Devon will win. Better endurance, yeah. But is there any possibility Ungar will have better position and then Devon will have better position?
Denis Cyplenkov: Yes, he talked about endurance, but if, of course, Kedrgaly has a good start, I think Larratt will do everything to fight with endurance. Yes, and Larratt will do everything.
Engin Terzi: uh much with endurance you know inside the end with more endurance you will keep it yeah then a lot of people auctions many yeah i understand yeah but looks like ongar web has many options so the way that he pulled against michael he did this and come back and he rise up you know this guy it's incredible you know i mean i i mean i was very impressed
Engin Terzi: Like Michael is incredibly, I mean, like strong and he is unorthodox style and his endurance and he can come up and then depress the way that Ongarbaev counters against all these weapons. So Michael was, to me, was very impressive. Can you ask Denis, what does he generally think about Ongarbaev? Does he think that he is very impressive?
Denis Cyplenkov: Yes, he likes it too much.
Engin Terzi: he can show good many styles it's really good uh yeah especially when you look at him the guy is not big you know his arms are like you can even say yeah yeah and then whenever you look at him and then whenever i look at michael michael gained like seven eight kilo in one and a half day
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah. His arms were like huge. And at the press conference, I look at Michael, I look at Ongarbaev, and I was like, Ongarbaev has no chance, you know. But of course, you know, it is not because only Michael is big. Michael is a very good armwrestler as well. You know, I saw some training with Doc. He make, you know, too much pumping. For pumping training, he make too much. And that's why, like,
Engin Terzi: bodybuilder. Yeah, I mean, many years of pulling, you know, his forearm and upper arm, you know, he's just, yeah, you are right. He's also training for general fitness. Yeah, that's probably, but, but those Kazakh guys are not that big. Yeah. Because again, his genetics, I think depending from genetic too, they have good endurance.
Denis Cyplenkov: and that's why he have like this like devon larat you know he's not a huge muscle haven't and he couldn't get more his genetic like this yeah so when you look at devon from a little bit far
Engin Terzi: doesn't look big but when you come in close you look at him okay he's really big but just because his arm is so tall it doesn't really show the size when you look at closely you realize that his arm is really big he's not that serious yeah you know what would be the good match dennis i think a good match no matter what the result between john and you i mean it doesn't regardless it would be a good match you and uh devon would be a very good match
Engin Terzi: my opinion maybe something maybe someday anyway so silky wilkie in the regalia versus monster michael todd reminded me of young hermes and
Engin Terzi: young ms versus takashi yeah uh natasha michael tolstoy man probably yeah that measure was very good anyway so okay i let you guys you guys rest thank you for coming hopefully i will come i will come to dubai i will be at the corner of john and then john is gonna crash dennis like
Engin Terzi: such a good guy you know how can you not love i mean i don't think on this or anyone that doesn't like dennis i i don't think so yeah yeah these guys everybody fred who know deeply of course everybody understand yeah but i think for the for the bad people dennis can also be someone
Engin Terzi: to be scared but but as long as he doesn't any have any reason the guy is the most friendly guy you know even the way that he loves the cats shows what a great human inside of him you know yeah yeah right today morning we sit in the reception one huge guy sportsman too with his girlfriend go near us
Denis Cyplenkov: When he saw Denis's feet like this, mistakes, doors changed. They go the other doors, they go out, they disoriented when they saw Denis. Sometimes the people, it's different. They were scared of Denis? Yes, some people who don't know,
Engin Terzi: yeah dennis is such a such a gentle heart you know seriously as i said you know before i didn't know him but more i get to talk with him you translate we don't we cannot directly talk with him but he just like
Denis Cyplenkov: and you know he tried step by step slowly to understand little bit english yeah yeah whenever i talk to you he already left see that right now look at him sometimes he asked what is this in english
Engin Terzi: today it's uh he asked me about towel what is this he says towel oh if he wants he can do i will tell you something you know i'm not i'm not extremely the guy is one of the smartest guys that i met in the community the guy is very smart guy so i'm sure that if he really wants he's gonna learn there's no there's no doubt yeah yeah
