Unknown: Hello, guys. Hello, Benji. Hello, Steezy. I'm missing television. Hello. Hello, Marco, school lady boy.
Unknown: Is it unbreakable? You are not banned here. That's good. That's good. It means that you still didn't do something wrong here. He was. How is Hermes feeling? Soon we will find. We will find out. Down behind me. Hello Rob. How are you my friend? She is.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Hold on, wait, it is. How come I can't hear him, Heather? Hello, Rob. How are you, my friend? That thing's terrible. Can you just open a light? Yep. Can you turn this shut up? Hold on. It's on mute. Hello, everyone. Do you guys hear me?
Zurab Tavberidze: Oh, no. Can you hear me? I hear you. Yeah. Is it him? Yeah. This fucking lighting is terrible.
Engin Terzi: How about now? You hear? All right. Just need to hear the volume. All right. Can you hear me again? I hear you. Do you? All right. I can hear you now. We're good. That's good. That's good. That's all right. How are you, Rob? I'm good. How are you, buddy? Tired, but good. You must be tired as well. No, man. For me, it's just midday. So we're good. No, when I said tired, I know you're a busy man. You work hard.
Engin Terzi: Oh yeah, I mean, five kids, I'm always busy. You know how it is. How many you have? Not as much as you do. I have a son. OK. Thank you for everything you do. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Thank you for your support. Yep. Hello, Roman. How are you, my friend? I'm doing good. Hello, brother. How are you?
Engin Terzi: Same thing, different day. Yeah. Yeah, and we are waiting for Zurab. Zurab to come? Yes. Yeah, so... Rob, I heard you are training. You have been training. Where are you right now? Like 80% maybe? Yeah, I'd say maybe a little more. I'd be happy if I can just get my shoulders to feel...
Rob Vigeant Jr.: My arm feels strong. My hand feels great. It's just working on a little conditioning and the overall body strength for me. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of the tightness for me. My arm has always been capable, but some of the linkage in my shoulder and chest, if I wasn't working out, would need to catch up. But yeah, I mean, I feel with the weeks going by, I feel like each week's a good checkpoint. I feel like it's getting better. So.
Engin Terzi: I'll do what I can. That's good. That's good. Yeah. I'm happy to hear because we didn't see you. We haven't seen you a long time. So when you say that, like you are more than 80%, so it means like easily 85% and you still have two months. So I think you will be at your best in my opinion. Yeah.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: I mean, my plan would be to come in and be strong and fit. And I think people always want more time and think they could be more ready. But just like having kids, if you keep putting it off till you feel ready, I think in your mind, you'll never be a hundred percent. So if you get even close to like 90 plus, take it and run with it. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. And also, I mean, you can't always be like really a hundred percent, you know, and then that way, if you are,
Engin Terzi: that perfectionist you know you can't pull you know exactly yes sometimes you need to have a warrior spirit and whatever the condition is you need to fight yeah yeah i think i think as arm wrestlers for the most part i mean you're always walking that line of being over trained and kind of injured or feeling under trained yeah yeah yeah i agree hello drop hello hello
Engin Terzi: How are you? Good. Good. And you? I don't know, man. He's good. He's good. Yeah. He needs to turn the phone sideway. Yeah. He's going to do it right now. Yeah. He's in a gym, isn't he? Yeah, he is. No, it's now. Yes, he's in. Now it looks like. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Wasting no time. How are you, Zurab? Good, good. Good? Biceps strain. Biceps strain. Show us your biceps. There you go. Yeah. So, Zurab, what do you think about your opponent?
Zurab Tavberidze: saying that uh rj is very strong
Roman Tsindeliani: He has never met like him personally, but he has heard that Rob's palm is very huge, you know, in armwrestling, and he's looking forward to, I know, grip up and armwrestling with him. He thinks that RJ is very, very strong. Very strong opponent? Very strong opponent, yeah. And Rob, have you seen Rob's past matches?
Engin Terzi: like against many others, like top players, like Barbosa, John, and like some other top guys, Tata Shinks, you know. And have you watched them? He has very big wins. All the videos that exist on the internet and is available about Rob, he has seen everything, all the videos.
Zurab Tavberidze: So what does he think generally?
Zurab Tavberidze: So Zurab is saying that he doesn't think that any of us, so he means himself and Rob,
Roman Tsindeliani: will do something very special like we have never seen. He expects the best way that RVJ pulls to go against the best way that he pulls, like we all know those styles. And he thinks that whoever will be the most ready and the strongest at the competition, whoever shows up the stronger than the other, will be victorious. So he has respect for Rob and he is taking him very, very seriously is what I understand. For sure, yeah.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: yeah and and rob have you like studied your opponent yeah i've well i've watched all the east first west was which is when i really first started watching him but then i've seen some of his other videos just as a a fan of the sport so you know i've seen all his pulls through east first west i don't know what has he had maybe five of them or so or six yeah he's been in almost every card
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Yeah, this will be the sixth event that he has been. Only in the first one he didn't compete. Other than that, every event he has competed, yeah. Right. And of course, like I watch... What's that? Do you expect a tough opponent? Yeah, of course. I mean, with his physicality and size, you know, I've never met a loft champ in any category that wasn't an extremely...
Rob Vigeant Jr.: tough arm wrestler i mean you don't get that title for free and you know he's been winning every match he's pulled with the exception of john brazink and chance who was a true super heavyweight and i think chance has a an odd lane in the straps it's really difficult for some guys but as far as his uh endurance and capability i i think he's pretty much top of the food chain
Roman Tsindeliani: Can I shortly translate this?
Roman Tsindeliani: Zurab Vesegi, if I were to compare him to you, I would say that he was in the middle of all the East vs. West, and he was the first one to say that he was going to be in the middle of all the East vs. West. Which means that if he was to compete with everyone, he would be in the middle of all the East vs. West, and he would be in the middle of all the East vs. West, and he would be in the middle of all the East vs. West, and he would be in the middle of all the East vs. West, and he would be in the middle of all the East vs. West, and he would be in the middle of all the East vs. West, and he would be in the middle of all the East vs. West,
Engin Terzi: And Rob, how do you see the chances? Do you see yourself as a clear favorite or do you expect a match that can go either way or how do you see that one?
Engin Terzi: Rob, did you hear my question? Oh, you're asking me if I see him as a favorite or me as a favorite? No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm asking, do you see yourself as a clear favorite or do you expect a very evenly tough match that could go either way? I do think...
Rob Vigeant Jr.: i i do think coming out of the gates as i am uh i think it's a tough match i do i expect him to be really hard and if i do anything other than that i'd be super happy i think in most people's eyes because of my inactivity and zarab's win list and resume especially these past year or so he'll probably be viewed as a favorite but in my heart i think it's i think it's close
Engin Terzi: uh you know i always consider myself a favorite if i'm trained but i know that it's uh that's not saying i don't understand the threat that he carries okay i understand it you accepted the match and you believe you can win but you know that he's a very dangerous blue is it true that what i understand is yes exactly exactly yeah yeah yeah but sometimes
Engin Terzi: Sometimes, like when you are pulling nonstop, one and a half year, you also get a little bit exhausted, you understand? Like every event, every two months, three months, every two, three months, you know, you may get exhausted. So it has some positive size and some negative size, you know, that he may be also tired, you know, because he just, sometimes you need to get rest, you understand? And what I am guessing that you are totally healed up
Engin Terzi: I mean, you know, when you pull like nonstop, you have some micro injuries that, you know, you don't realize, but with time, it affects your performance. But when you get a good rest, you come back, you feel like your joints, everything. Do you have any kind of problems, any injury, anything left after your rest? Only just a little bit in my shoulder when I put on side pressure. So it's not totally weak, but if there was a weak link, that would be it. So it's something I got to work on.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: uh because i'm i'm pretty sure that pulling a guy like him without a shoulder is a bad game plan yeah yeah i would need some stability so that's probably it is that's been a one that i've had for quite a few years so it's just working on that but my arm feels good my wrist and everything feels good but then again that's good in the trainings i'm doing i i'm not going to 110 like i'll have to so who knows yeah i understand well i'm sure that like the the
Engin Terzi: two months that you have i am sure that like like once you start something uh building something from zero is different than when you already build everything but it is not there just because you are inactive but you have two months two more months i think that it's gonna it's gonna come back you are not building anything new you know oh i mean if if we're gonna just put it on the line and you know tiptoe around it i'm not gonna try to come in with the
Rob Vigeant Jr.: any excuses if he beats me he he was a better guy and he implemented his plan better and you know i'll go back to the drawing board and try to do what i can with more time i'm going to show up there as ready as i can be and uh you know i i expect that i'll feel pretty good and there's going to be a result that's about it and another question before we ask to zura um in your head
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Did you find out the best way to pull against him? Like you made your game plan already? Yeah. Yeah. I honestly think that there's probably two lanes I'd like to keep it to. I think I have more than one option because I think that I'm a versatile puller. I'm not a guy that has one lane I stick to. I feel like I could do everything at a good level and what I feel like I need to
Rob Vigeant Jr.: work on i will work on in these coming weeks but um i i have an idea what i'd like to try you know whether that works or not is up to me and us and how that plays out but yeah i definitely have uh from looking at and assessing um i think i figured something out
Rob Vigeant Jr.: yeah and by the way who who is this like trainings are you joining do you do any training with yeah that's my every week every week i go to an arm wrestling training and uh with a group that probably gets anywhere from 20 to 40 50 guys so it's nice size practice and um i'm only about an hour away from jerry and because he's going to be pulling i'm going to start getting together with him weekly
Engin Terzi: And then I've been getting back into the gym too to try to supplement the overall body strength, get the shoulders and chest healthy and, you know, total body stuff, get the range of motion and just be healthy. I understand. And Roman, can you ask Zurab if he's like on his mind, he made the game plan for Rob or he's just going to do his own way or he needs to do some adjustments?
Roman Tsindeliani: Zuro, I would like to ask you this question. What do you think is real? Does this strategy have a specific purpose? Or is it based on a certain style? No, I don't think so. I think it's physical, but I think it has a strategy.
Zurab Tavberidze: Theoretically speaking, I think that the way the system works is that, for example, when a large amount of money, as you said, is spent on the ISF, for example, it is not enough to support the people of Taiwan.
Zurab Tavberidze: Yes, I have a lot of experience in this field. I have a lot of experience in this field. I have a lot of experience in this field. I have a lot of experience in this field. I have a lot of experience in this field. I have a lot of experience in this field. I have a lot of experience in this field.
Roman Tsindeliani: uh so he started saying by uh that he will show up in his best shape the way he usually uh pulls at his best but for sure he has some uh some things that can be specifically done against rvj because in theory uh he knows at some point uh how rvj would pull
Roman Tsindeliani: And he had one example of when he tries to slip from the top, when opponent tries to slip from the top, he may just try to grip with fingers and try to control the opponent. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So such and such details Zurab has noticed. And in theory, he thinks that he knows how a rope will pull.
Roman Tsindeliani: but like physical physical wise he's gonna do his best what he's good capable of and also he's not gonna disclose everything that he may have specifically for rvj prepared
Roman Tsindeliani: Okay, okay. He just told the extra detail that basically he doesn't want to hide this. His strategy is that he's going to try to tire Rob because he thinks that in endurance game, Zurab is famous. So he just straight up says this, that he will try to tire him out as well. He is very, very, very clear, you know, telling everything. On that one, on that regard, he was very clear. Nothing to hide. That's what I'm going to do.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah and and people are saying that this is the sixth time they see you in a row every east versus west event and they are saying that people are asking me if zurab is planning to rent a home very near the east versus west uh area you know
Roman Tsindeliani: If you will give him a guarantee that he will be in each event, he might as well do that, yeah. OK, then let him. I will rent him an apartment over here.
Engin Terzi: yeah he would gladly live there so yeah why not let's do this yeah yeah i understand yeah so and and he he rob said that you know he of course he's coming there to win but he says very close match you also uh think that way and you are saying that it is very dangerous to try to
Engin Terzi: uh get out of his hand he can catch your fingers and then uh opinion you bought i see that you made the analysis and this match is going to take uh at 95 kilo category and let's see let's see where like for example like compared to your previous opponents where do you see rob
Roman Tsindeliani: Zurab, this is a very good question, and I would like to ask you about your opinion on this, because it is a very important question, and you can answer it. What do you think is the most important thing in your opinion? What do you think is the most important thing?
Zurab Tavberidze: He is very good at all kinds of sports, for example, football, football, football, football, football, football, football, football, football, football, football, football, football, football, football, football.
Roman Tsindeliani: So, physical-wise, he thinks that capabilities would be somewhat equal to his previous opponent from Canada, Prokchop. But obviously, in comparison, Rob is way more experienced and technical, and Surabh said that he respects because of this Rob.
Roman Tsindeliani: and he he thinks that rvj could actually be prepared for any opponent because he knows everything about arm wrestling and he can prepare in any style against any style so that's what he thinks that he's different from other monsters so he is he is saying that he is not worried only about his power he is also worried about his technical abilities and his knowledge about experience about harnessing uh rob you know
Engin Terzi: Unlike, you know, his previous matches, Zurab is just talking very highly about you. You know, about the previous matches, he was just like, he was just talking like he was not even considering except John Brzee, like his opponents. But with you, he's like more careful about what he's saying. So what's your take on this?
Rob Vigeant Jr.: I mean, it's a, it's a breath of fresh air in the sport. I mean, it's something I've talked about recently to some other guys. I think that it's got too comfortable with athletes tearing each other down too much. And, you know, I think that it's okay to have a match where there's a level of mutual respect for someone's abilities. And, you know, sometimes there's not a lot to say, but have a level of respect and,
Rob Vigeant Jr.: we can have respect and both want the same thing and that's sports and only one of us is going to get it, but it doesn't mean that he's not worthy and I'm not worthy. So it's been a long time since I've pulled with someone that hasn't, uh,
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Tried to tear me down and, uh, you know, the respect is shared. I mean, I think he's a very dangerous guy and I was most keen on watching him pull Ron bath and John Brzenka as those are two super legends and they've got similar physicality to me. And, uh, anyone who can grind in the positions he did and do the things he did. I can't help, but respect them. And I wouldn't want to take a match with somebody that I didn't feel that I had to really chase and work for. So, you know, uh, the respect is appreciated and it's given mutually.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah I don't know why some a lot of people on they underestimate you rob whenever I said and then whenever they talk they talk like you are heavily underdog and things like that but but um maybe that is because you are you have been inactive maybe you have been inactive maybe that's why because whenever we look at your career if they are
Rob Vigeant Jr.: confused with your match with Sasho or something you know that that is also like a very special individual and yeah right I mean I think I think the Sasho match is unfair to me to judge me for more than more than a few reasons I mean we could say that I could give my reasons why but even if we don't okay Sasho won but Sasho was beaten
Rob Vigeant Jr.: everybody he beat on grabayev he's beat prudnik he's beat iraqli three of the best guys in the world we talk about sasho beats and he just you know and and these guys are beaten now the guys that sasho beat are going on to beat some of the very best in the world at any category yet i'm the one who gets shamed for it i didn't lose a match a single super match for years and years and years and i lose one to a multi-time waft champion and people talk about me like i'm some bum
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah i will show up in this match against the rob uh more physically and mentally prepared than i was against sasho but i had a very short amount of time to prepare for that but my friend again you know losing against sasho i mean people could be crazy to think that you know you are losing to like
Engin Terzi: regular guy you know the guy is just one of the most dominant guys in last what almost eight years or something you know eight nine years and right as you said you know they both were 90 kilo to be directly i organized the event from tommy he be directly yeah
Rob Vigeant Jr.: And the last round, he even toppled Irakli. You know, so... And Prudnik's never even beat him. He's beat Prudnik. He beat Ongarbaev. He's beat some of the very best. So, I mean, I believe in my heart that if we ever rematch that, he's got a very unique build. And it's very... It's a learning curve because he's so short. What I mean... I believe that I was more in that match than meets the eye. And with a little preparation, I feel that I was good for that match. But...
Rob Vigeant Jr.: That's what people are judging me. I mean, I think the other part might be that because of my life, I've had periods of inactivity or I would show up not at my best. And I used to defend myself a lot on that. And I'm kind of over that. You know, I'm kind of ready to just instead of being the guy who talks on YouTube and explains myself, I think you can get a lot of words across with an action. You know, if I show up and actually compete and do what I think I can do.
Engin Terzi: that says a lot about someone just willing to step into the arena and bang is more than a lot of people are giving me credit for yeah that's also rock you know just you are you are like most of your career you pull against the north americans and i think that i think that like you are smart enough to
Engin Terzi: find out you know i think you need to get in the mix with the east east side guys and more the those americans are coming here more they are they figure out you understand like like how to what do you understand so what i'm just that was my goal we are just one world but we are just like separated so we just pulled winning losing all these athletes are incredible athletes like losing against each other is no shame you know whoever is thinking it's a shame like
Engin Terzi: I mean, Michael gave, for example, Ongarbaev an incredible match. Ask Ongarbaev. Ongarbaev will say that he probably has faced one of the toughest match in his life, you know? So, I mean, no need to make fun with that guy, you understand? And Ongarbaev was incredible. He was like first time ever for someone like Michael. He was able to...
Engin Terzi: like know how to deal how to counter everything michael is doing so i just saw an incredible chess game there i don't care you know who loves it who won there it's not my i'm an organizer but i really enjoyed i enjoyed how michael pulled and i was very impressed
Engin Terzi: like someone like on that where i never seen him pulling against someone like with the open arm couple but he was able to counter with the southern shoulder pressure on uh so what i'm saying it's beautiful that we meet each other um and then pull and we learn i'm sure that they are learning a lot from the american pulling and americans are learning a lot from the eastern guys and i think that now
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Yeah, I mean, that's what we need more is more appreciation for the fact that, you know, yeah, Michael could lose. If people want to talk about Michael losing, but John lost to the same guy. And there's no shame in that. These guys, you're talking the very top 0.0000001% in the whole world. So it's like going to the Olympics and taking a bronze medal.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: They are like in their 20s, prime, prime, prime. While the guys, the one is near 50, the other one is near 60. Even still being in the match, it shows that they were of that caliber and on a different day, maybe it goes a different way. But to shame somebody for being, you know, I said it's like going to the Olympics and taking a bronze medal. Sure, yeah, everybody loves the guy who wins the gold, but that doesn't mean the guy who won the bronze medal sometimes isn't behind by only like a hundredth of a second too.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: You know, it's very comparable. It's very close. They all deserve the respect and admiration. Yeah. Outside of the Olympics, those guys, if we say like the 100-yard dash, outside of the Olympics, they are way, way, way faster than everyone else on Earth that weren't at that final 10. And that's what they say is that East versus West, the worst guy in the room is going to be the best guy where they come from. Yeah, that's why they are there, yeah. You're right. Yeah. Yeah, Zurab, my friend,
Engin Terzi: what do you what do you think about uh the level at the east versus west you think that every event the level is increasing more is becoming more and more elite and do you think that do you think that you know americans the arm wrestling is like uh how to say organized modern time arm wrestling sport of arm wrestling is american
Engin Terzi: because we all learn from their top role look this and this they they it was a developed sport first in north america then we learn from there and then we also develop here but do you think does he think that like eastern guys are also learning a lot from those guys like legends like john brzenk legends like talk about things like pulling against this like michael todd and you know these these guys are like at the age you know they are you know
Engin Terzi: like we can say like much older you know almost all old enough to be their father you know but do they also learn some things from his uh masters of the sport so uh
Roman Tsindeliani: The reason for this is that it was said that this is the way it is, this is how it is, we are from the West and our Europeans are from the East and we are from the North and we are from the South. And it is said that this is our people, our Georgii and Europeans. If it is not true, these legends that we have been told,
Zurab Tavberidze: and these people will teach us a lot of things. Now it's up to you what you want to do and if you want to do it. It's up to you. What I want to say is that I have a lot of motivation to be a sportsman. In America, on Facebook, on Instagram, on Instagram, on all platforms, on all platforms. And I want to work hard.
Zurab Tavberidze: and the competition will increase. This is very important. What will happen?
Zurab Tavberidze: The Americans, from America, from Canada, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States, from the United States,
Zurab Tavberidze: There are a lot of great sportsmen and legends like Johnny, Larratt, Mike Dodd, Blagent, who are very famous in Europe. It's been a long time since I've been to Europe and I'm very happy to be here.
Roman Tsindeliani: So, first of all, he said that the first part of your question about East versus West event, obviously level is rising and it is very good. This East versus West event actually motivated the entire armistice world in a whole another level.
Roman Tsindeliani: And this is very good that each event keeps getting better and better, not only like production wise, but also like the level of armwrestling increases. And other than that, yeah, about this Western and Eastern poolers, he said that let alone Devon Larratt and John Brzenk are worthy to be studied by Eastern poolers and to learn from them.
Roman Tsindeliani: Exactly because of the subject, throughout the history of armistice, Western pullers were there and Easterners learned from them. Then he mentioned several names like Pagans and others, Mr. Michael Todd as well, and he could have mentioned so many other names as well.
Roman Tsindeliani: because of the fact that the Easterners learned from them and then they did some more adjustments to it. Now, Eastern poolers are actually taking it also a bit of a different level as well. And also he remarked one fact that Eastern poolers are way more right now. So like armwrestling poolers are more. Obviously, so many countries are involved. So yeah, that's basically that was his answer, yeah.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah I mean people can learn it's like so unfair you know they say like you know it's just stronger you're talking about one country and some athletes also a few that came from Canada for today and then you're talking about 50 countries you know so it is more like North America versus world you know they're more like
Engin Terzi: so that is very very hard what what you know us is doing if you compare country versus country one country versus country then then the things would be much i mean much better in that favor maybe except the light ways that i mean they are doing very well you know like michael gave very hard match to ongar where in 115 uh they wouldn't easily beat rudnik except the round one and then jerry
Engin Terzi: one against canada and this so they are they are doing very well you know and 95 kilo pauline is the title holder so i mean they are yeah very well so those four categories 9500 515 and over there are there are three of them from north america
Zurab Tavberidze: Yes, yes, Zurab, just ask me if he understood properly. Yes, yes, Zurab, just ask me if he understood properly. Yes, Zurab, just ask me if he understood properly. Yes, yes, Zurab, just ask me if he understood properly.
Roman Tsindeliani: So he agreed what you said, obviously, and he was also saying the same, but now he also pointed out population and also the size, sheer size of USA and Canada is basically bigger than Europe. Whenever we say East,
Engin Terzi: are not talking about in europe yes oh yeah so many people told you there is also asia asia as well you know so many suggestions where like go against asia and europe battle each other and then by the way i want to i want to make an announcement and there is a the the match it is gonna be changed uh haji murad zolev is gonna pull
Engin Terzi: uh chechnya event at the beginning of april and april 23rd which is only 13 days before uh east versus west he's gonna pull the russian nationals and he has to compete russian nationals uh he has a good reason and the guy is 85 kilo so he is pulling 85 kilo match 13 days before the east versus west and his east versus west title match that was i was thinking to set
Engin Terzi: uh was in 95 kilo so we thought that you know and he also said that he wants to pull in 85 kilo so most likely in july event he will be pulling 85 his match is not going to happen with pauline but pauline rob he's gonna pull against sacho andre so this is this is the announcement i wanted to make um pauline will they both go inside it is gonna be the the
Engin Terzi: So we will see. We will see. They both go inside. They both have good side pressure. And Rob, were you surprised when you saw Pauline
Engin Terzi: on round three against rough thumb he tried two times like something like outside but we know that rough time is very dominant hand you know to attack in there it's just like not many people have been successful especially last 15 20 years in his category we didn't really see yeah and then and then rob uh paul went
Rob Vigeant Jr.: totally in. And then, of course, Rustam got injured, but still, it looked, you know, very effective movement. Yeah, I think what these guys do, like Rustam, Sasho, I think it's not just their strength and how efficient they are at getting in a hook. They know how to set up. They know how to use their physicality and their body in such an efficient way. And they're so crisp with it that sometimes trying to top roll them gets you in more trouble than just going with it.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: And that's something I learned with Sasho even. His setup was so protected that maybe trying to top roll him was more aggravation than just trying to hook him. But with Rustem, yeah, the first two matches kind of went like I thought. And, you know, the third match, yeah, Paul got a nice stick on him. I would have liked the scene to play out, though, because I also know that Rustem is that guy who,
Rob Vigeant Jr.: that has no problem grinding for like three minutes. And he's a very, when you watch some of the matches like him and Zolovev and stuff, that sometimes getting in a match or stopping somebody, there's still, I'd like to have seen it play out. And I mean, that's no fault to anybody for Rustem or Paul. And Paul had a much better game plan, I would say. But I mean, those guys like that, they do grind for three, four, five minutes. I've seen Rustem and Zolovev more than a few times
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Paul for like three minutes once the match stops, you know. So stopping a guy is sometimes that, but who knows how close it was to beating him. And also Rustem looked like he needed a few more months of prep. He, you know, he looked like he pulled a me where he took some time off and then now he's coming back to the sport.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: mean that's one of the most dominant guys ever in the sport he he embodies if there's ever anybody on a legends list he's definitely one of those guys yeah yeah yeah yeah still you know we can't take away anything from paul um he went there i'm not taking anything away from him at all the situation was what it was but from an analytical standpoint it would have been interesting to see had he not hurt his back because yeah
Rob Vigeant Jr.: just because rustum flashed or went to the pad quick and then around three the match stopped you know he's still incredibly strong in that grind yeah yeah yeah yeah it's just i i can't make definitive uh seeing roston pull for how long now i mean i can't make a definitive prediction on what would happen yeah and can you ask roman what do you think about this new matchup
Engin Terzi: Pauline versus Sasho. Just one second. I'm not fake. I'm not fake, my friend. Okay, go ahead. He thinks Sasho is favorite. He's going to win. Sasho is going to win? Yeah. People are thinking that, you know,
Engin Terzi: Zolev would be better for Paul. I mean, Sasho never beat Zolev, you know. Like, I saw them at least two times. In one of them, Zolev won when Sasho was trying to go sleep. And the second time, he hook him and beat him. So Zolev is not any weaker opener. I'm not saying that Sasho cannot beat Zolev. But to say that Zolev is weaker than Sasho,
Rob Vigeant Jr.: I mean, it is just a big... The other thing, too, is Zolovev looks like in the years past, he's been working more of his top role better, too. So he can do both. When you see the way he pulled Todd Hutchings, the way he had a lot more full hand control, you know, the first time him and Todd pulled, Todd beat him 6-0. And then the next time they pulled, he beat Todd 6-0. So he developed... He beat Todd 3-2.
Engin Terzi: no no when he pulled when zola pulled todd yeah three two zola beat him three two he beat him three two oh i think he went in the hook with him willingly one time and then yeah already he lost one round there it was three one after three one he went to inside but it was three one then yeah hook was very last round yeah yeah yeah brown because he guaranteed the match three one so he they both went to uh okay
Rob Vigeant Jr.: okay but it was the three wins were very controlled and his top role looks like when you have somebody that can do both at the highest level it's really difficult to know what they're going to do so i think zolev in a lot of ways is super dangerous you know different than sasho but super dangerous yeah but you saw that right the one of the masters will be sasha was also inside oh with what sasho
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Zolaev hook, I'm sure. Oh, yeah. I only saw the one where he top-rolled him. I was talking about when Todd Hutchings pulled Zolaev. Oh, no, I understand. But Zolaev still, even here, is... Yeah, well, Zolaev's had a top-of-the-line hook for how many years now? 15 years or more? Yeah, a little bit more. He was just a very good hook. But when he pulled Todd Hutchings, Todd Hutchings was...
Engin Terzi: like about 36 hours before the match he was 97 kilo probably was a little bit over 100 because he was cutting uh weight by you know water and he was probably 220 and the zole was about 91 kilo against 200 pounds but still in the hook um yeah i think it was better it's not that easy to be taught that is not really hooking you but he is going more like
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he uses a lot of shoulder and elbow drive and Zola's more muscular, Todd is like structure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so I think it's going to be, so let's go a little bit about the other matches and the opinions. And I would like to start with Zurab. Zurab, what do you think about, I know you are from Georgii, but what do you think about Devon Woods, Genadi?
Zurab Tavberidze: I think it depends on the person. I think it depends on the person. I think it depends on the person. I think it depends on the person. I think it depends on the person. I think it depends on the person.
Roman Tsindeliani: Zurab said that even though Prudnik was beaten by Devon quite dominantly, regardless of the score,
Roman Tsindeliani: He believes that Genadi is much more threat for Devon. And if Devon is going to be prepared as much as he was against Prudnik, but just only the weight would be higher, then he has practically no chance against Genadi. And if he becomes also stronger physically, like almost the same shape that he was against Levan, yeah.
Zurab Tavberidze: What did you think of Lewandowski? Was he serious enough to score a goal? No, no, no. He is a very good player. He is 50-50. If he is serious enough to score a goal, like Lewandowski, he is a very good player. He is a very good player. He is a very good player.
Engin Terzi: Oh, so if Devon takes it as seriously as he took match against LeBron, then odds are 50-50 in that case. Yeah. He cannot just say clearly. Devon is a smart guy. He knows how Canada is coming to this match. Anyone who is playing against Devon Larratt, especially from East, is seeing this match as the match of their life. The biggest opportunity.
Engin Terzi: Devon is one of the best ever pullers. And this guy is by far the most famous puller. So if you are pulling Devon, that is an opportunity to show yourself. So, and then Devon knows this and that Devon will come, you know, I don't think that he will come here like underestimating Genadi. And there is a super quick, I will read Erlich Mazur.
Engin Terzi: Engin, what are your thoughts about the arm wrestling whisperer? He's famous TikTok arm wrestler. Dave you heard of him? Would you put him in a match? Yeah, anything is possible. That guy is, yeah, very, very good ambassador of the sport. Yeah, why not? I mean, I'm not saying I will, but I mean, it could, you know, be possible, yeah. Yeah, anyways, and you, you,
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Rob, you know who Genadi is. Of course, yeah. I mean, I fashion myself to be, I'm not on the line as much anymore, but I'm still a humongous fan of the sport that watches whatever videos come my way. And I think that, you know, Genadi's got the kind of style I like. I mean, he's aggressive and he's versatile. He can throw his shoulder in there. He can top roll. He can flop. I mean, he's a whole package.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: And I think he can get a sneaky win or two in there on Devon, maybe in the early rounds if he kind of gets Devon outstretched and kind of bangs his shoulder in on him. But I just think Devon's going to be too conditioned, too strong, too tiring. Devon's an anaconda, you know, and he lets people like get their breath and then he constricts them. And it's not just the waiting game, but he's incredibly strong in his angles and
Rob Vigeant Jr.: I think with him being healthy and trained, we're going to, you know, it might be a coming of a new era. And he might even be able to, with the new data with LeVon, make a true blue real charge for the number one spot. And, you know, I know Devon likes to troll and talk and get people's feathers ruffled and stuff. But I do think there was some validity with the level he's at right now that –
Rob Vigeant Jr.: If you put anyone on the other side of the table with him, with what I'm guessing his form is, I'm not really betting against him. I think he's the favorite in any match he takes. Yeah, maybe exception with Levan? Well, I think, you know, Devon's a very calculated individual, and he's got a lot of...
Rob Vigeant Jr.: faith in his frame and his structure and being healthy goes a long way and i think what he saw with ermys i think a lot of people are thinking of things a little bit differently after what ermys did and of course ermys is strong and big and capable in his own right it's not saying that anybody can do what ermys did but i think another guy in the top five top ten has got to be thinking that it's plausible now you know they got to see some chink in the armor whether it's
Rob Vigeant Jr.: conditioning or he has trouble with that flop press i mean i gotta say that jerry's got to be licking his lips about that match so yeah i mean for me devin's a favorite with anybody at this point in time i understand and as a north american of course you are sporting your teammates right no i'm not like that at all i mean i'm really uh i try to keep it as as honest as i can i do i just think that that
Rob Vigeant Jr.: devin's in a super match setting round of six and how good devin is in the straps and in that bottom end where people fade out and die on him uh i just think he's too proficient and too hard to keep him out of his lanes it's not a north american thing it's not an i don't i don't only vote for north americans no no no no that's not what i meant oh other than your opinion
Rob Vigeant Jr.: uh we heard that lately you and devon went a little bit back and forth but it doesn't matter right you are supporting your fellow north american team west of course yeah i mean devon likes to troll everybody i think that he might wake up his wife and his kids with trolling them daily i mean you know he just likes to get things going and get people talking and
Rob Vigeant Jr.: in some ways it's really good for the sport. So, I mean, you know, Devon's, Devon's still a buddy of mine. We, we, we jawed at each other, but that's about as far as it went. You know what I mean? That's what I want, because some people just watch that and they judge by what they see. I just wanted to clarify that, you understand? And they are like, oh, now they're enemies. You know, they're like the Ramayans. No, zero, zero angst or hatred or anything. It's,
Rob Vigeant Jr.: It was a night that Devon enjoys that kind of stuff. And because I talk loud and fast, people think I'm always angry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it is a powerful West team, huh? Very powerful West team. Yeah, I think this team, when I look at the roster, the team coming in this time, it seems like we're well represented. It's unfortunate that Todd won't be able to make it out there because, I mean, he would have just added to that
Engin Terzi: level up but i mean the team we got is pretty good yeah yeah and let's go with zura another georgian rewas versus chef he stood up comes leo bashi
Zurab Tavberidze: I would like to say that there are two disadvantages to this situation. First of all, we have a lot of money. In the 50s and 50s, we had a lot of money. We had a lot of money, but we had a lot of money. We had a lot of money, but we had a lot of money.
Roman Tsindeliani: Okay. Well, it's hard to say who would win because one guy has the advantage in some points over the other. He said that top row, Revaz can top row better in this case, but side pressure is Dave's better capability. So he thinks that it would be 50-50. Endurance, both are kind of struggling with endurance.
Engin Terzi: So that's why he thinks that 50-50 because Toprol is better, but side pressure, Dave, is better. I understand. There is one super chat from a guy that likes to finance East versus West. Pauline. Pauline, thank you for your super chat. Can't wait for East versus West 7. An opportunity to travel with such a great group.
Engin Terzi: and be on the same team. See you fellows there. Thank you, Pauline. It is always an honor to host you here, my friends. And wish you good luck. Wish also Sasho good luck. You know, people are saying you are underdog, heavily underdog. And it was the same when you were pulling against Rustam. So let's see how it will be. And how about you, Dave Sheffy versus Rewas? You know Rewas.
Engin Terzi: yep yeah um i've seen him come come at people a lot is he is he predominantly a top roller yes he sees it but he was he surprised me when morozo hook him he also gave morozo big trouble you know morozo like almost losing and hardly from here raised him up and then
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Yeah, so he might have a little more body strength than some of the other guys that have tried to top roll Dave. I mean, outside of the way he matched up with LeVon and maybe he's even bigger and thicker, Dave's got a ton of power. And, you know, endurance might be a problem depending on who. But after seeing Dave pull a big, long, incredible top roll like Vitalii,
Rob Vigeant Jr.: And getting in there and grinding it and having the heart to push it through, I have a hard time betting against Dave unless it's a very small group of people, you know. But it's not a match that's going to surprise me either way, you know, because Revaz didn't get to the position and beating the guys he's beaten by getting lucky. He's also very capable. So that one for me is a 50-50. But if I had to bet, I'd be leaning on Dave just for the raw horsepower. More, more, more tight pressure. Yeah. Arm.
Engin Terzi: side power yeah just raw and then we have we call it versus tobias drop with left arm left arm people people uh zura people are thinking that this is a mismatch and i kind of don't see that way because i mean i saw when morozov tried to top roll
Engin Terzi: Tobias, round one, when they put Supermatch, Tobias toppled him and beat him. And one round, he slipped his hand badly, you understand? And then he beat him in a hook, you know, he just pinnated grip, and then he hook him. I don't think that Laletin has that kind of ability. So he will go topple versus topple. And both of these guys have incredible grip, hand strength. And
Roman Tsindeliani: Tobias is about 193, and the other guy is 205, very high, tall. And how does Zurab see this match? Zurab, this is Tobias and Vitalii's story. In the beginning, it was very difficult for the two of them to compete. They wanted to see who would win, if they didn't win. It turned out that Tobias and Morozov were very close to each other.
Roman Tsindeliani: And many people think that this is not going to happen, that Tanabari will win and Vitalii will lose, but Tobias is not going to win, and it's not of your interest. I think Tobias will win. Oh, he thinks that Tobias will win. Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying that Tobias is going to win, but to say that, you know, Tobias doesn't have any chance at all is just like, I mean, probably they don't know much about it.
Roman Tsindeliani: obviously uh so azura uh pointed out tobias's age he's young and so it means since then he could have also gained uh more and uh got better so he thinks tobias has the w on this one yeah and and another thing that just if people wants to watch like for example people says latin's left is better than right but whenever he was pulling against this i don't know you will see
Engin Terzi: I don't know beating laletin with left while laletin was beating him with uh right you remember drop you remember right as well incredible but it's not like that you know the the I don't know with the back pressure and side pressure I have seen him beating I'm not saying again Tobias is gonna beat but it is not like Tobias is not as weak as people are thinking
Engin Terzi: And Larratt is not as unbeatable as people are thinking. So Larratt may still win, but it is not like that, you understand? People just probably going by the name, you know. And Rob, do you know these pullers, especially, you know, Larratt, but do you know Tobias? I know him from watching him at the East vs West and I saw a few of the matches and then I, you know, did a Google search. So, yeah, I watched some of the videos about him.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: He looks great. You know, it looks like a great polar. And I agree with what you're saying. I mean, I think at face value it's fair to make Lillet and the favorite, but that's what all sports are made out of is they're really built on the upsets and the heavy favorites falling and a person who shouldn't be there rising, you know, the champions and legends can get made in a moment. And I think that,
Rob Vigeant Jr.: for people to say that anybody in any of the matches doesn't belong there is a little unfair, maybe with the exception of a few matches, but this isn't one of them, you know. I give Vitalii the nod just because of his longevity and his dominance, but like you said, it's somewhere in the middle, right? Like, I...
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Tobias is better than people are thinking, and the Laletin's not quite as far away as people want to think. So I guess it'll be one of those matches that comes in and we'll know the truth when they start banging. Yeah, yeah. Who is his hand will handle the pressure more. I mean, I do think that Vitalii's probably got a different skeleton in lane than a lot of the guys he's been beating. So that always poses a problem, but, you know.
Engin Terzi: Someone can unlock it. There is a super chat, Douglas Irish. Thank you for your super chat, Douglas. In my opinion, this is the best West team yet. East versus West is the best thing to happen to our messaging. And he is asking, ask Zurab if he is getting his nails done. Zurab,
Roman Tsindeliani: Yeah, he sees me getting it done in special places. What's the joke? I didn't understand. Okay, what's the story?
Roman Tsindeliani: I think he knows what's the story behind it. They were having a dinner together. He and then Douglas mentioned that Zurab is so much like
Roman Tsindeliani: taking care of himself. He thought that also his nails would be done by a specialist. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then let's go to the next one. Arif Ertem versus Dzeranov. Arif. Arif is my favorite. Arif is favorite. He's going to win for sure. Arif will win for sure, he says? Yes.
Roman Tsindeliani: He thinks that Arif actually can do even better than he has done so far because if he takes even more seriously and if he prepares even harder than what we have seen, it will surpass his achievements that he has already shown us.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: So he's going to be able to beat. And Rob, do you know these athletes? Yeah. After watching, is it Arif? Arif, how do you pronounce it? Yeah, Arif, yeah. After watching, he's the one who pulled Corey West, right? Yeah, he's the one who pulled Corey West. Yeah, so we all know how good Corey is and
Rob Vigeant Jr.: uh how strong his hand and wrist and everything is and his ability to be as explosive and proficient and powerful as he was yeah i think that's his match yeah but do you know his opponent have you seen him does that i don't know yeah he was i think he was on the same card wasn't he against uh sergey
Engin Terzi: yeah kalinishenko he was one before one before yeah yeah he was i don't know a lot about his career i know he had a long-running career like he took a layoff and came back correct yeah he before he quit he won the world 2019 over iwan matushenko and alexander getalo very strong guy very strong guy
Rob Vigeant Jr.: So you both are thinking that Arif is the favorite? I just think until proven. Otherwise, Arif's running real hot. I mean, he looks like he's just really comfortable and proficient with what he's doing. And he moves pretty fast for a big man. And I like the fact that he gets a little bit wound up. He's an aggressive dude. Okay, then we go to another one. And how do you see Pauline versus Sasho, Rob? Paul is from your team.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Yeah, yeah. Well, we're going to, you know, I told Paul that at least I can give him the data I know from gripping Sasho, from feeling him a little bit, whatever I can offer. I think if we work on the general plan to keep Sasho out of his lanes, you know, that's a lot of what arm wrestling is, is kind of trying to...
Rob Vigeant Jr.: implement what you want to do while taking away what the other guy wants to do and i think paul's capable of it for sure it's just a matter of you know sasha's no dummy either and he knows what his shortcomings are and what his strengths are and he's very proficient at getting there so we're just going to have to do as much school work as we can but uh i would i would say paul is very capable of winning that match i can't pick a favorite because sasho's
Rob Vigeant Jr.: also super capable so it's going to be in their preparation i don't think i think it's a very fair match i mean i'm pulling i'm pulling for paul and i think on a capability level he definitely can do it it's just going to come down to doing the homework and the school work that's it you know he's a he's a he's a bigger man but you know sasho's been winning for a reason you know he's not been buying those trophies in a crackerjack box he's been earning them
Rob Vigeant Jr.: but uh i wouldn't be you know i wouldn't be surprised if we come in with a winning recipe and and and paul takes it yeah yeah yeah yeah uh zulu is asking how what happened with pauline and zolo oh zola i think i explained were you not here roman when i explained i don't think he i don't think it got translated but
Roman Tsindeliani: but uh i i have not translated so could you would you please so zura be saying that uh previously was talking about this one and uh was he you can translate yeah briefly because okay okay zolev is pulling especially i went one month before the east versus west
Engin Terzi: at 85 kilo in super match in may is 95 kilo i said okay there is one month so he can gain weight in one month some at least because he is never 95 kilo he's always 91 kilo 92 maximum yeah and after this i said okay but then i also found out that he is pulling
Engin Terzi: russian nationals championships again 85 kilo what i was told and only 13 days before east versus west so 13 days before east versus west he's playing russian nationals just imagine if this guy got injured what am i gonna do if what is this guy i told them already that listen if you are playing a east versus west world title match
Engin Terzi: you better not lose somewhere and come here because that match is going to get cancelled you know understand it's not about zole or something you come in here and then if somebody just beats someone you understand and or if you get injured or something you understand so it is not right that it's not zole's fault i'm not blaming him
Engin Terzi: it is just i just think that it is not a risk that i can take also zolev i found out that he thought that he was pulling 85 kilo in july arsene lily was doing the translation so he translated him he misunderstood me arsene misunderstood me i told him 95 kilo in may and 85 kilo in july because the guy is making 85 easily so he thought that his 95 kilo was canceled already
Engin Terzi: and only pull in july so yesterday i shared the poster and i sent the poster event poster to both pauline and zola and zola have shown me that i mean i'm not pulling why you you made this point and i was like you're not pulling are you serious he said yeah arsene told me that i'm pulling in july so there was a problem with the communication because he said he is pulling two events and he said he won't be ready and then i said arsene listen this is not how we talk he said i can convince him to put me
Engin Terzi: and then i found out that you know that about the russian thing 13 13 days ago so i said okay you're right you know we couldn't do that you understand it is not like like if i knew that i wouldn't set that much at all problem at 85 he is a problem at 85 kilo i'll tell you that yeah yeah let's see most likely he's gonna pull the winner of brandon assessor uh versus uh david yeah
Roman Tsindeliani: Yeah, I will briefly translate what you said.
Roman Tsindeliani: And I thought he was going to lose 10 kilos in a single fight. And now I think he was going to lose 95 kilos. I thought he was going to lose 95 kilos in a single fight. And I thought he was going to lose 95 kilos in a single fight. And I thought he was going to lose 95 kilos in a single fight. And I thought he was going to lose 95 kilos in a single fight. And I thought he was going to lose 95 kilos in a single fight.
Roman Tsindeliani: Zurab said that he would also have done the same just for precautions.
Roman Tsindeliani: uh because of the uh such tournaments high level tournaments may we don't know but he may get injured that's what's going on yeah so that's normal that i can take is a like world title match so another one would have told me that batro saginashvili would beat
Engin Terzi: many many guys they said that he is incredibly strong and people don't know about bachelor macho he's a very young kid and very powerful but he because of like i saw him in 2019 he was like 14 15 years old the next year we had poet thing in the 2021 georgians put in part space
Engin Terzi: And then last year is the same. So this guy is very strong in these years. He couldn't show himself anywhere. So many people from Georgii asked me to set a match for this guy. They said, you are not going to be disappointed. And I said, Okay, I believe you guys. And because I like to give chances to if people are talking that heavily, you know,
Roman Tsindeliani: So I said to him, it's an emergency. And he asked, Zurab, what does he expect from this measure? ZURAVILLE KHALILZADER- Zurab,
Zurab Tavberidze: This is why I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here.
Zurab Tavberidze: If you don't have a job, you don't have a job, you don't have a job, you don't have a job, you don't have a job.
Roman Tsindeliani: So lack of information is there for Zurab. He really doesn't know how powerful either of those guys are. But considering the fact that he has information about both of them, for instance, if Adam was really at least had some bit of struggle against Bojidar and considering that Bacho is being like well known that even in nationals of Georgii, national championships, nobody can even stop him.
Roman Tsindeliani: that he thinks that Bacho would take the win on that case. But he cannot really for sure say it because of the lack of information. But I think his favorite is Bacho, yeah. Yeah, you don't know about... Is it Bacho or Bako? Bacho, it's Bacho. You probably don't know about Bacho, right?
Rob Vigeant Jr.: I've seen a couple of videos because it was coined as like LeVon's cousin or something. I saw a few videos. But again, when you see these like highlight reels, it's hard to know based on who they're pulling. If you're pulling really good guys or if you're pulling, you know, a lot of people can look like Superman depending on who they're pulling. So he may be great or he may be really good or he may be something, you know, higher or lower than what we're talking about.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: hard to know without a common opponent. You know, it's really hard to draw. But we know that Adam has got a ton of endurance and a ton of grit and he's well coached. So I don't know enough about the other guy to make an educated opinion. If he's good enough to come in and compete with or beat Adam, then he's certainly the real deal. Yeah. Yeah. We will see. Like, it's just a big
Rob Vigeant Jr.: That's what this is. That's what's beautiful about this, though, right? For so long, there's been nothing that's really gotten everyone together. Even WAF, you wouldn't get the real top guys for one reason or another, whether it was too much money, conflicting in schedule, whatever. You wouldn't get the real top guys from the West. You'd get a lot of them from the East, but not all of them. But you're really pulling from all the different continents
Rob Vigeant Jr.: the very, very top guys. And it's answering a lot of questions that haven't been answered for ever. Maybe, you know, it's never really been answered. This is my friends. This is East versus West is global level reality. It's a global level. Yeah. It's taken a lot of speculation out of it. So we all have questions and that's what this is doing. It's taken the speculation away.
Engin Terzi: And again, you know, people need to understand that, I mean, you need to be very strong and you need to have very big balls to step that stage. So losing there is the least funny thing, you understand, like that you can make fun of it. I mean, this is just like an incredible level. There is nothing, you know, higher than that. So, I mean, just,
Engin Terzi: I see, like, gladiators there, you know, like, all the time, you know, they just go to the, that, how do you call that place that they were fighting against each other? How do you call that place, Roman? The arena? Yeah, yeah, that's what it is, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's what I basically told, you know, I talked to Doug Erlich a lot, and
Rob Vigeant Jr.: I told him the same thing when he was coming out here to pull Coach Ray, and everyone said he was an underdog, and, you know, people were kind of giving him harassment online, like, where'd you come from? Who's Doug? And I says, you know what, Doug? If you're good enough to get the invite from Engen, it doesn't matter if you win or lose. That's already a win because, you know, there are people who will pull talent for,
Rob Vigeant Jr.: a show or the way they talk or depending on what region they're from and wal didn't pull some guys because they couldn't speak english for the camera you're really going on a talent-based
Rob Vigeant Jr.: pool for the most part for like 98% of your guys you're pulling guys that have a real real resume and every single match each guy probably has their own level of state national world level events or matches under their belt everyone in the room is hyper accomplished or a super rising star so like you said losing there is it's really the highest level of competition that I've seen in the sport and probably ever
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah whenever i said that there is nothing like funny about losing there somebody said that they think that uh like i misunderstood you probably the guy missed the beginning of the uh conversation that you know we were talking about that you know
Engin Terzi: whenever you say that there is nothing shame to losing against Sasho. That's, I mean, I would be my best shame and then I would also lose against Sasho. It's not, I mean, beating Sasho is something that incredible. Losing to him is not like any shame, you know, the guy is. But again, you know, I like the way that you are talking highly about Paul's chance against
Engin Terzi: uh sasha and i think the way that he is pulling is probably very effective you know like i haven't seen people trying to beat sasha more you pull more he puts you here with the incredible side pressure so the smart thing is to make him you know because he is
Engin Terzi: he's providing this with this solid angle here so you need to attack on his pronator yeah you need to take out his shoulder and pronator yeah anyone that i saw beating sasho they beat him mostly attacking on his you know pronators to cut that because the guy is getting his power here so you need to put him if you put him here
Rob Vigeant Jr.: But he's still attacking, he's saying he was still, you know... Yeah, and that's very similar to what we talked about. We kind of assess that. And I mean, talking about it and becoming comfortable enough with doing it in real time is, you know, that's what we're going to work on. I understand. I understand you. Let's see another one. Another one we go. Brandon Alcacer versus Samushia.
Roman Tsindeliani: He's not sure about the weight. Is it 85 kg? Because Brandon seems quite big. Yeah, he was 90 kilos last time he pulled Craig Tuller.
Engin Terzi: At this weight category, Zurab thinks that Davit is dominant. 85 kg?
Roman Tsindeliani: We will see what will happen. But since he thinks that he can beat Brandon, what does he think? Samushia, if he beats Brandon, can he also beat Zolaev? The same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos. In the same weight category? Yeah, 85 kilos
Roman Tsindeliani: Obviously, he wants to win, but objectively saying, he thinks that Zulayev will be favored in that case. Zulayev would be favored, right? Yeah. Yeah. Zulayev, can you ask? I mean, it doesn't sound nice, but Zulayev has no win against Zulayev, right? Zulayev has won against Zulayev every time they pulled. Zulayev understood what you said. Yeah. Yes.
Zurab Tavberidze: My first match was in Europe in 2015. I was in the second final in 2015. Then I was in the second final in 2013, and I didn't make it to the final. I think I made it to the final, but when I was at the end of my career, I didn't make it to the final.
Roman Tsindeliani: So he remarked two main facts. Basically, every time he met Zoloev, Zoloev was in his peak shape and Zoloev was just getting started. He first showed up in 2015 when Zoloev started his career in Europe and Zoloev beat him twice there. So basically up to 2018, Zoloev kept beating him. But now I guess it would be...
Engin Terzi: So when Zulop started the armwrestling, Zoloi was already multiple world champion. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And do you know Brandon? I'm sure you are following Brandon. Yeah. He's coming to my house. He's coming to my house in, I think, three weeks to train.
Engin Terzi: oh that's good i like that you know what i really like that you know those team west is meeting last time i saw before they come here i have seen who did i see i see douglas pauline
Engin Terzi: Craig. Justin Bishop. And there was one more guy, I think. Yeah. Craig and Ertem. They were all together. I love it. The team competition. I believe that those nations, you know, I mean, instead of war and this and this, we need to compete against it. There is nothing. Those guys, of course, they are team. They want team East, team West to win. But at the end,
Engin Terzi: or before we just hug each other at the end they just go laugh you know we get to know each other it is there is nothing even zero hate involved they all became very good friends but i love that competition you know that level yeah and that's what we're doing we're all leaning on each other
Rob Vigeant Jr.: trying to come together they're gonna try to help me with my match and I'm gonna try to give the data I know and it's good that you're gonna get to pull with guys on that level too because it's a big country and we're spread out far apart so in our little training groups it's hard to get the kind of pressures you need you know on that world level you got to try to like get creative with like rubber bands or weights or things but yeah Brandon's I know Brandon pretty good I've I've
Rob Vigeant Jr.: remember when he came into the sport ways back and he's he's set to come here in a couple weeks so i have a good idea of uh what he's about he will be he will be good training i'm sure yeah yeah i i worry it's a little like i worry that the weight's a little light for him i think that he's a bigger kid this guy knows how to lose water
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Yeah, but I think even 90-kilogram might have been light for him. He's probably more like a 220 guy. He's got a good level of musculature, and I think 85 might be light. And, you know, I do think that Brandon's got a lot of endurance and a lot of heart, and he's a dog in that dog fight. I mean, he really is. But I think Samushia's at that weight is his elbow, his arm, his –
Rob Vigeant Jr.: ability to sit in that spot that's so strong and so sticky he's going to be a tough hill to climb and and i think i think i agree that at that weight aside from maybe zola webb you know i'll i'll see what i can do with brandon and how strong he may be and where his weight's really at but i i would say right now he's he's an underdog to some degree you are saying on the paper david luke favors
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Yeah, on the paper. Because 85 is small for that guy, and that does take its toll. Losing weight like that does take its toll. There is another guy that may be slowly getting ready for Davit Samushia. Anyways, so... Is that the... I thought that guy turned into a promoter. Yeah, that guy. You know that guy?
Engin Terzi: I heard of him once. He's supposed to be pretty good back in the day, though. Yeah, he used to be. He has been. He's just dreaming, you know. He's just fulfilling. And, okay, let's go. Alizhan Muratov versus Kody Merritt. Alizhan Muratov.
Zurab Tavberidze: First of all, about the question, he said that Alizhan would win.
Roman Tsindeliani: and then he mentioned his left arm is completely healed right now and he asked you it was the kind of type of ask for you again so next summer event of uh east versus west he wishes to pull alijano left hand for 105 kg title if it's possible no no no if he didn't if he didn't lose that terrible to oleg petrenko you know he thinks he thinks that by competing there it is the right decision
Engin Terzi: But whenever you lose like this, you don't pull the world title match. You need to say, hello, Engin, I'm injured, cancel the match. Tell him to be careful about his reputation. All right, all right. I see your point there, Engin. Tell him.
Roman Tsindeliani: Well, like he could also pull Oleg if he wants.
Engin Terzi: We will see, I guess. I don't know. My left hand is pretty good too. Your left hand is good? Yeah. I've won a lot of national titles left hand at 200, 220, 242. My left is good. Maybe some point. Let's focus on right arm this time. Every time I said guys with left and right and then people are
Engin Terzi: Oh, why did you do that? Why did you say that? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, in fact, the athletes are asking me. I asked Corey, right arm match? He said, how about my left arm? I said, I mean, you want? He's like, oh, yeah, yeah, left arm too. And then I give four hours break and then still people blaze me. So then I'm like, OK, never mind. Yeah, yeah, that's horse hockey. What do you think about Ali Jamorado, Rob? Do you follow that guy? Yeah, I think he's incredible and definitely one of the best guys in the world.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: and you know i think the politically correct thing to do when you're on these types of teams and podcasts is always vote for your team so it's not weird when you see the people on the plane or in the airport but i'm definitely vote i'm definitely thinking that alizan wins that do you think he's gonna be called the marriage yeah i think so wow he looks too powerful i mean he's so he's just he's hyper impressive
Rob Vigeant Jr.: And, you know, that's not saying Kody's not, but there's like starts to be like little levels. And I just think what that team brings and how prepared he is and the culture that he comes from. I mean, those guys have joints of like titanium joints. And it's really hard to get through that once they get into that lane. And I could see him being in like a top roller type position. But I think that their joints and elbows and everything are so strong and so capable that
Engin Terzi: You've just got to be flat out stronger than the guy to beat him. And I don't know if that's going to be the case. Do you realize that, you know, like the real Kazakhs are not so muscular? They like look at him that way. I mean, look at him like during the press conference. I look at my right side. I saw Michael.
Engin Terzi: and then look at my left side i saw on guard and i was like i know it's not about the size i mean you are not talking about the bodybuilder when you talk about michael you know if michael has size good size for that weight i mean it means something you understand and the way that he performs as you said how you describe is your mother language and you are very good about expressing yourself the way that you express the joints oh yeah you are
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Yeah, he's like, those guys over there, those Kazakhs are like, they're like Bruce Lee. They've taken the ability to develop their body and make it, they're like the next level for arm wrestling evolution. They take a body that shouldn't be able to do something and do it at the highest level. I mean, when you see, I'm a big fan of Talgat. Is it Aktaev? Talgat Aktaev? Yeah.
Rob Vigeant Jr.: I'm a big fan of him, how explosive and fast and strong he is. I mean, there's a guy that's doing things. Imagine if you could take that hard wiring and that conditioning and put it on somebody that has the muscles and the bone structure to back that up. It's just a real Testament to their coaching and that they've become super proficient at what they do with what they're working with. You know, if you put that on a very big skeleton with a very strong muscular guy,
Engin Terzi: now you have somebody that's that's the next evolution of the sport yeah i pull i pull octave and look at you i was in good shape and i'm i'm a quick guy fast guy like ready go like he hit me like i felt the back side of my shoulder there was something happened there but i catch him and then we were like this he hooked me but i still had tornado and then
Engin Terzi: at a foul and the second start i realized that if i try to go that way it may be bad for me you go and then you stay here so what i did was just with a drag hook you know i i really go i we hit again at the middle and then i drag him drag him on his bicep and beat him wrong one my back shoulder
Engin Terzi: both terribly get injured because of the hit that he hit oh the sideways hit is what hurts your shoulder like that yeah the one that he hit you know of course my tornado forearm everything handled but it's not that only your forearm is you you have a hit that way you understand so backside on my shoulder got injured i i the rest of the tournament i pulled with injured shoulder i ended up third he came from b sites
Engin Terzi: And he won the gold. I and him, at the B side, semi-final, I couldn't pull, you know, because we took a break from the evening. And I was like, my shoulders, you know, after it gets cold, you understand? Between, you know, qualification and finals, it becomes even worse. You know how it is. That's the same exact injury. That's the same exact injury that I struggle with. Right back there, that the side pressure hurts. I heard it when I pulled Marcio, that same side aggressive choppy hit.
Engin Terzi: and i felt something go but hey engen um i gotta go pick up my daughter so yeah uh rain check on the rest of this interview yeah can i ask you one last thing quickly sure yeah because this is the last one i can iraqli zrakashvili versus
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Wow. Um, I would say right now, based on what I saw with Iraq and John and, uh, anger by Evan, John, I'm betting on anger by of his hand. He protects his hand in such a way that it's not susceptible and has relentless
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Top roll, I don't think he would gas out and give up. Personally, I think that match was John's to win against Irakli, and maybe somewhere his endurance faded and he got caught in a spot. I think if John pulled Irakli again, he'd probably beat him. But I would say that based on performances, I don't think it'll be easy, but I'm betting on Ongarbaev. Okay, but it's a good match, huh?
Rob Vigeant Jr.: Oh, yeah, of course. I mean, Irakli looks super diesel, and he's getting better every time we see him, and his top roll is super crisp. But I just think that the way Ongarbaev sets up and pulls in the straps and protects his hand, he's going to be very hard if you take a top roll lane with him. When we saw John beat him, John used a lot of his wrist power and kind of turned him palm up out of that top roll lane. But when he could stay out there and kind of like load back – yeah, when he pronates out –
Engin Terzi: Right. Instead of focusing here so much, I think that if you would focus more, just cutting the comb, because you are here, you do this. Right. Once you are turned this way, you can use your triceps. Right. And I think that at some point in time, a Rackley in that, even if they stand tall,
Rob Vigeant Jr.: I think his wrist will buckle if he gets eager on Ongarbaev. I mean, that's another nod to the Kazakhs. He's right on top of the food chain in that country, and he's just checking all the boxes for everything that makes a complete athlete in this sport. So it'll be a good match, but I think as the match goes on, I'm not going to bet against him. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to go pick up my daughter. Okay, you take care. I'm going to sign off. Thank you. We'll catch up soon. Yeah, take care. Take care.
Engin Terzi: it was nice to meet you i also want to mention that you know just because uh john ended up here over pronated sometimes you don't choose to be there just sometimes the power and everything forces you to end up there can you ask iraqi about this match uh
Roman Tsindeliani: Obviously, he wants Irakli to win and he will root for Irakli. But 55 to 45 favorites is objectively Ongarbaev in this case. Ongarbaev is the favorite, yeah.
Engin Terzi: I mean, I kind of say that, like, Irakli is no way weaker than Ongarbaev. Irakli is very strong, but I kind of think Ongarbaev has more control, you know, he's more controlled, you know, and that is, like, I'm not sure if Irakli can guess Ongarbaev out, you know, like he did to John. But how about Irakli's press versus Ongarbaev? But this is why it is, you know,
Engin Terzi: john gets tired you understand i am not sure if if ongar wave is gonna get tired you know it's very hard to pull against michael todd and at the end ongar bear was the man who was still standing understand when i said standing i mean his power was still there he he exhausted michael at the end yeah i don't think that that john has the endurance so uh michael
Engin Terzi: no longer where ah that's what you mean yeah yeah yeah so but i really don't know like john maybe like john may have more horsepower maybe then they don't gotta wear but the control plus jonathan is incredible control but the endurance of ongarbev is for sure better than uh john's at this age i'm not talking about young young john young john would just would destroy everyone yeah
Engin Terzi: yeah so he's saying the 55 45 anyway so you know uh guys uh about uh hermes versus jerry match hermes said that his backside or his shoulder as far as i understand is problematic he said it was problematic even before and before the levan match so
Engin Terzi: He will do his own announcement if he can pull or if he cannot or something. I think Sunday he's going and then he was going to make his own announcement. I and him, we agreed with him. We agreed, we made the agreement. And then we also made an agreement
Engin Terzi: that if he cannot pull in May, he's gonna pull in July. It's not that it's not a contract. I never did a contract with anyone. I said about 100 matches, which means a total of 200 atlas. Of course, the same atlas came, but 200 different times, you understand? And everything is working by the promise
Engin Terzi: of the organizers with promise of the athletes. And until now, there has never been any problem. Not from my side, neither from any athlete's side. So it looks like he's going to come here and pull in July if he cannot pull in May. But he's going to make his own decision.
Engin Terzi: i'm sure that he will go and say tell this decision on his channel most likely anyways thank you very much my friend it took long time and thank you very much and i wish you the best and if you want an apartment here to stay here thank you
Engin Terzi: He's going to be waiting for guarantees and then also thinking of you. Yeah. Okay. You guys take care. Yeah. Take care. Thank you very much. And thanks to everyone who watched us. You're doing a great job. You're doing a great job. We all are doing together. Together we is not. Yeah. All right. See you next time. Take care. Take care, my friend. Take care. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: okay guys it has been one hour and 42 minutes i think and i thank you guys for being with us and hope to see you guys next time with another podcast once again thank you
