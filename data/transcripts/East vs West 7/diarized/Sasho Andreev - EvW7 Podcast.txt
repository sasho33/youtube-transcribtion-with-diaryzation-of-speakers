Unknown: Do you hear me? Do you hear me?
Unknown: Mm hmm.
Unknown: hear me i don't want to hear you maybe now yeah yeah yeah can you
Unknown: increase the volume if you can if possible uh volume to oh yeah yeah yeah yeah but yeah but now i need europe i think that's maximum okay okay how are you good so oh i'm i'm good after work yeah the rafting at the bulgarian nationals
Christo Del Gaco: Yeah, I was refereeing and I also competed not bad. How did you do? Left arm third place after Gospodinov and Nedelin Hristov. And right hand second place after Nedelin Hristov, but I beat him one round in the... Okay, was it 80 kilos? 85. Why did you compete in 85? I'm 83, 84.
Christo Del Gaco: oh you didn't really prepare you just you just competed yeah yeah I'm strong but not uh not enough fit you know yeah but that's not your category your category in fact is about 75 80 maximum yeah but you you know what I do I I I I beat very easy Nedelin and after that on the final I give him to put in good position
Christo Del Gaco: see if i can beat him slowly you know just but he have better endurance but also was very very top much and that is wrong you know he is not wow you you were too curious and it cost you a gold medal yeah but it doesn't matter in bulgarian you know it's when you have a lot of medals it's not necessary to take the gold medal now exactly
Christo Del Gaco: For me, it's better to make good match, you know, to see where am I, you know, because with the speed, he say he have some pain in the elbow. And when I starting, he cannot catch it, you know, but without speed, he's very strong. I think Sasho came. He's connecting. Yeah. Hello, Sasho. How are you?
Christo Del Gaco: uh he didn't hurt about the microphone i i would i would tell him to put the microphone yeah also i think the camera needs to be going down but
Unknown: Guys, Paul couldn't make it because his working hours and Sasho's availability didn't fit each other. Hello, Paul. You must be at the work.
Unknown: Hello, Sancho, how are you? You hear us? Yeah. Good to see you. Me too. Congratulations. I think you won two golds, Bulgarian lessons. Thank you. Can you ask him how is his form generally? You know, we saw him.
Christo Del Gaco: He had some injury, and then we saw him compete at WAF, Europeans first, and then he won the WAF, and now he won the Bulgarian Nationals. How is his shape? Sasho, I want to ask you how is your form as a whole, because you have played in the European, then in the international and in the national, and how do you feel about your form? Because you had an injury before that.
Sasho Andreev: He said it's
Christo Del Gaco: injury that injury was before a reggie and um after uh after that uh on the world championship the injury was uh go bigger but uh after that he have enough time to recover the injury and now uh he he feel very good he didn't feel pain and uh he will see on the turkey though that's that's the way to see how is his shape because in our national
Unknown: wasn't enough for him you know yeah yeah yeah yeah and last time he came to istanbul he pulled iraqi he won 4-1 and this time he's coming for a direct world title match he deserves and his opponent is pauline what does he know about pauline and what does he think about his upcoming match
Christo Del Gaco: Sasho says that the last time you came, you played with Irakli and finished 4-1. And now this is a match for the world title. And this match will now be with Paul Linn. What do you actually know about Paul Linn? What are your expectations for this match?
Sasho Andreev: Well, the expectations are to repeat the mistake, as it was said, as the first match that I underestimated him. As a whole. What do you know about Erwin? What do you know about Paul Linn? Well, what do I know about you? Well, you know how I am in the sphere of...
Christo Del Gaco: Yes, I will explain it now. But it's not something personal, right? No, it's not personal in any case. Okay, I'm explaining. Sasho says he expects in this match not to repeat the same mistake like in the match with Irakli. He will be more concentrating and
Christo Del Gaco: Uh, he wants to not lose any round. Um, and, um, also when I asked him what I, that's the reason why I, when Eugen asked me, uh, what, uh, he knows about Pauline actually Sasho say, I know everything what you told me. That's mean what I told him.
Christo Del Gaco: because Sasho really didn't know nothing about all of the competitors. You know, he didn't interesting to watch who, how he playing or something. Even I remember when... I was told one time somebody speak about the match with...
Christo Del Gaco: Jordan Tzonev and Todd Hutchins and he say I don't know for this much I never see it you know he's not sure about he's only focused on himself if he is good enough he is good enough he doesn't care what his opponent is doing yes yes he says this is most important yeah he understands
Unknown: yeah it's not necessary he what he knows it's necessary everybody to know him okay so then he's saying that they should worry about him more than yes you can worry about them so he said they let them worry this is what he's saying exactly exactly yeah so that that is confidence that that's good can you turn your phone sideways on the screen so it can be here uh bigger yeah
Christo Del Gaco: yeah that that that's interesting that's interesting so he only knows and what did you tell him yeah what did you tell him because he said that he only knows what he told him yeah I told I told him about Paul it's um first of all it's very strong and uh also when I watched the match with um rustam
Christo Del Gaco: And I see when the first two rounds he tried to pulling him and the third round he going inside. I think when I watch this, I think it's maybe they will change the games. You know, maybe now Paul will start to going inside with Sasho and Sasho will pulling him. I don't know. Sasho pull very strong, you know. I'm not sure.
Unknown: I'm not sure the pulling wrist can hold that. I don't know. He hooked John. When John didn't want to hook, he easily hooked John. Yeah. We will see. It will be very interesting. Yeah. That's what it is. Listen, if you come to the East versus West stage, everyone is a superstar there. When you are losing, it's not a shame. When you are winning, it's, of course, glory.
Unknown: I mean that like two incredible athletes and there will be more competing that night and I think that you know it's beautiful that they will get prepared they just go ready go boom you know and then we will see the results you know and that is like for me like that's the biggest success you know just let them pull again you know losing at the east versus west stage is no shame at all because everyone is
Sasho Andreev: Even to be on that stage, I think it's a big honor because it's really a high level. Yeah, it's the highest level in armwrestling. I would say so. I would say so.
Christo Del Gaco: Sasho said that's what he also wants to tell us.
Christo Del Gaco: because uh pauline it's in this level in east versus west if he is that means he's in the highest level in arm wrestling and he respect him and uh just it's um the problem of sasha is just he didn't watch so much uh youtube arm wrestling you know and he didn't know a lot of the competitors yeah but that's interesting sasha that you are like
Sasho Andreev: a great armwrestler right there at your level, and you don't follow armwrestling. How is that? Why is that? You don't enjoy armwrestling? You don't enjoy watching? It's mostly him who tells you that. I understand him. It's mostly him who tells you that. I hold on to it and try to get people to know me, so that I don't pay so much attention to others. It may have helped me to some extent to be at this level.
Sasho Andreev: Yes, but he is asking if you don't like watching Canadian wrestling in general. I like it, I don't know. I watch it, but if someone comes and shows it to me, my brother is much more interested in it. He comes and shows it to me, he watches it, he even knows it better than me. But as a whole, I'm interested in where he plays, how he plays and things like that. I prefer to focus on my own
Sasho Andreev: Igor, it's not like he's going to win a match because his weak spot is there, is it? I understood Sasho's question. Sasho states, he...
Christo Del Gaco: He watches videos, but only when somebody comes to him to show him. Like example, his brother loves arm wrestling and sometimes he comes with the phone and says, look at this match, this is a very interesting match. And Sasho, it's not interesting to know how the competitors are competing and he doesn't care about the weak points of the competitors.
Christo Del Gaco: uh to know how to beat somebody where is his weak point or where is his strong point he's for him is important only his shape you know how sasho training and how sasho feeling good i understand a quick question what what's your weight now sasha
Christo Del Gaco: In the European Championship he was 86-87 kg, but now he is 90 kg. He gained some kilos.
Unknown: okay the question i want to ask him uh since he is right between 85 and 95 kilo categories would he consider pulling both categories in different events like sometimes you know like maybe next event for the 85 kilo world title you understand sometimes 95 kilo category is see like flexible to pull
Christo Del Gaco: In different times or not, yeah. They just called me again and I didn't hear anything at all. Yes, I'm asking if you are enough flexible and if you have the opportunity and desire to play for 85 kg, for example, world title and for 95 kg world title, if you are ready, for example, a match to say someone is interested in 85 kg to play again, for example, there.
Sasho Andreev: Would you lose up to 85kg and then play another match at 95kg? I would rather go up to 95kg and now I have started to go up to muscle mass and that's why things happen slower. He is talking about progress in time. Well, for progress, yes, I will find myself. I want to be 90 and a few kilograms. I understand.
Christo Del Gaco: uh he actually he wants to going in 95 kilo to put more kilo on his weight only in muscles and he is not uh he he prefer to not going under night kilo he prefer to go in 1995
Unknown: okay so he wants to compete 90 kilo buff and europeans and then professional he can go up to 95 kilo yes yes exactly exactly okay okay i understand yeah so um he said that at the beginning of the the conversation he said uh whenever i mentioned iraqi match he said
Unknown: he doesn't want to make the same mistake and doesn't want to lose a round, you know. So he is not only coming there to win the title, but he doesn't want to even lose a round. So, like, he wants to do a clean sweep. Yes, yes. He wants maximum from this.
Unknown: He wants the maximum success, maximum possible success. He wants to win and without losing a round. And so it is like what he wants or realistically he sees himself close to this success. Sasho, is this what you want or is it really what you think will happen?
Christo Del Gaco: He said first of all, the first one, you know, I, I, I won't, I won't winning, but actually realistic. I think it's. Well, I think he will win.
Unknown: I didn't hear you, Angel. Realistically, he's going to win only, or realistically, he will win 3-0? Yeah, he will win realistically. Yeah. Yeah.
Unknown: he he say probably paul also thinking like this and he won't like to to win he should he should everyone should think this way yeah yeah right and and can you ask sasho like this is i mean a new stage and does he feel nervous excited or comfortable uh on this or success
Unknown: yeah yeah yeah yeah like does it feel like you know he has been on the like wolf stage finals winning world titles but this is new so does he feel any nervous or he's just comfortable being on this stage
Christo Del Gaco: Do you understand the question? Since this is different from the European format, do you feel comfortable or nervous about it? Who can predict that there will be no doping control? It's just a different format, it's stronger, the level is higher.
Sasho Andreev: For sure, but I've been there before and I don't know if I've been lighter, but for sure, as before every competition, I have my pressure, but self-control, I think with so many years of experience, is good for me and I think my psyche is strong enough to not affect me and make mistakes.
Christo Del Gaco: as i should say it's um like every championship uh he's a little bit nervous before that and uh he had this feeling but he had very strong self-control and uh mentally he's very very strong yeah your finger is on camera okay okay yeah yeah say again yeah he feels comfortable
Christo Del Gaco: so he he feel a little bit uh before before every start uh he uh have feeling he he can you know a little bit scary and nervous but uh actually he had very good self-control and uh mentally he's very strong and he think he will not make mistake anymore
Christo Del Gaco: First of all, he asked me what I meant by doping control. I said no. The level is too high, not because of doping control. He will be heavier than me. I don't think I can lift 5kg for one session, but I hope my preparation is good for a heavier opponent.
Christo Del Gaco: and he said uh pauline will be a little bit heavier of him you know five kilo it's different and um that can be you know it's different category but uh he thinking he's he's prepared enough and maybe he will be okay even difference yeah yeah yeah i understand i think that sasha needs to be normally normal day
Unknown: Radek Machan, 92 93 kg and then for love 90 kg whenever there is a professional for you can make 95 you know three kilo less is okay but yeah. Radek Machan, That is vegan and he's he's like it's. Radek Machan, His way. Radek Machan, yeah he's. Radek Machan, He doesn't. Radek Machan, meet anything yet. Radek Machan, No. Radek Machan, Okay.
Unknown: long long time ago he start to he start with the vegetarian and after maybe before three years four years about vegan two years oh okay okay i am always like serious you know which are which are eating all the protein sources you know these guys are like incredible like muscle like like i don't know like either
Unknown: People don't tell us everything about this. You know, when I say like, they say that you only need to eat like meat, meat, meat, meat, so that you can have all those muscles, but I don't know. And does he know anything? Sasho, go ahead Sasho. I decided to try it for a month and it took four years, maybe two months without meat, then vegan for two years and two months.
Christo Del Gaco: he decided to try for one month how will be to not eat the meat and uh when he's starting now it's a four years and uh two months without meat and two years uh totally vegan without and and he doesn't feel any weaker he feels healthier or how does he feel i'm asking because i really don't know
Christo Del Gaco: If he's feeling weak, he will not go in some championship in armwrestling or just powerful sport like armwrestling.
Unknown: very good he feels strong stronger even even stronger and uh i because i discussed with him about it and he's he he feel healthy and he feel stronger uh that's good and another question uh what does he know about east versus west so far he said that he doesn't follow uh videos on youtube but does he know anything the how the competition is anything what does he know about his sources
Sasho Andreev: He asks what do you know about SWEST? You don't watch a lot of videos, but in general what do you know about SWEST? What information do you have about the competition itself? The whole world in the Canadian sphere knows about these organizations, these competitions. Except that I was at the beginning of these, I don't know if I was leading then. Yes, you are leading again.
Sasho Andreev: He said it's a
Christo Del Gaco: He knows from all of the competitors who he meeting on the championships. East versus West is bigger and stronger and with a better organization and just the event, it's very big now. Yeah, now it's even bigger with Sasho. Yeah, it's bigger before he was, he actually, he asked me, I think in the beginning also was East versus West or not, you know.
Unknown: say yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean this is this is our support is beautiful our sport is so good we need to bring it to the next level you know we deserve much more than this and so i hope that it will grow i hope that it will grow and i will i'm i'm gonna ask him his predictions about the upcoming matches and normally you know christo del jaco is
Unknown: world champion armwrestler one of the best referees in the world for sure no doubt and he's very smart guy but he is a referee at east versus west so we i'm not going to ask his predictions about the matches it wouldn't be like i cannot either because i'm organizer but we can ask sasho but i'm afraid that sasho is he's not following but he probably knows it like today do you know what i did here today
Unknown: i today i said mindanglas kerkasov match for 75 kilo we had 11 minutes mindanglas kerkasov yeah it's a new match new match both we i have been talking like for some time and uh kerkasov said that he had a super match with arthur makaro
Unknown: Maybe it better not. And then they said that they postponed the match for later date. And then he said he is available. And then so I set the match. Mindaugas Tarasaitis versus Cherkasov. Right-handed. Right-handed. Yes. Yeah. And can you ask Sasho? Prediction. His opinion, yeah, prediction, yeah.
Christo Del Gaco: Sasho, he asks what are your expectations for the other matches. Now, what he says is that he actually made another additional match today for this match against Suez. Tolek Cherkasov will play with Mindaugas Tarasaitis on his right hand. And he asks you what are your expectations as a result, to try to guess who will fight in the different matches that you will have, except yours.
Christo Del Gaco: It's a difficult question. I haven't thought about it much. Do you know who the other machos are? Yes, I do, but not all of them. Try for some of those. What do you think about Kvini and Larratt? I don't know who they are.
Sasho Andreev: I don't know what the answer is. Maybe it's because of a fight. Maybe he used more drugs. That's my real opinion. It's not very appropriate to jump, but... I think Genadi's jump is heavier and his turn is more difficult. I've watched his match with Proznik.
Sasho Andreev: In general, Quinier will be in a much different category from Larratt. At least in 2020 he will be heavier. Yes, for sure. But considering this, he has very long arms. But still, the weight will have an impact. And it will be a very interesting match for me. There are different games. Still, he trains with Levan, who is also a thrower.
Christo Del Gaco: Saju says he knows the other matches, but not exactly every of the matches. I asked him about
Unknown: one of the best matches probably in this championship will be if you know and why did you start that this is gonna i'm asking him the last match we will finish with that one i asked you he doesn't know about this okay we will start okay with your cows yeah yeah we will finish with the uh start from lightweight to the up there yeah yeah yeah you are right you're right
Sasho Andreev: Sasho, what do you think about Cherkasov and Mindaugas? Well, he said that one of them is Kachil Kachagoren.
Christo Del Gaco: No, he says that he wants us to start discussing the matches one by one, he will tell them the matches, it's easier for you, we will discuss them one by one and I want to say at the end, I will tell you later about this at the end, about Larratt and Kvikvinia, but to start with the lighter ones and for that I ask what do you think about the match between Cherkasov and Mindaugas?
Sasho Andreev: Yes, but they can somehow convince someone, because they can't imagine what kind of success he has and how he plays and what category he is in. In principle, they play at 72, but they are in 70 kg. Up and down they are the same as a structure. We need to prepare for this question. As a whole, for all of you, just to see who is where and how.
Christo Del Gaco: And then I can give a much more competent opinion than now. Sasho, maybe he has to prepare for these questions because he has to watch some videos of Cherkasov and Mindaugas and after that to say... Come on, he has been competing in the same events with them for 10 years at WAF and Europeans. He should know them. He doesn't know who they are? No, they play in another table.
Christo Del Gaco: He knows them, but he didn't know exactly how they're playing. He must watch some matches to be sure, to expect. He's not exactly sure. If he says something now and somebody can...
Unknown: say okay he didn't know that or this you know it's not good for him okay okay that's interesting he doesn't only follow arm wrestling through youtube but he doesn't even look at when the world championships happen in at least the finals or something when in the same event yeah but not super arm wrestling fan
Sasho Andreev: No, no, I'm just a fan. I just want to catch one of the heavy categories and try to try to compare the forces, not to get into such details as how he plays and where to play him. I've been doing it for many years after European and World, but I've tried to compare the forces with even with Genadi, as you can see.
Christo Del Gaco: No, but the question is that you are not such a fan of watching the finals of the European titles, because they played, for example, Cherkasov and Minda Loga played finals of 70 kg, for example. Well, look, how am I supposed to know that I have a final, I have concentrated on myself, to give everything I can, to be in a mental mood, and then the other finals pass me a little like that.
Christo Del Gaco: Yeah, he's actually right, because Sasho said when he watched the final, for example, Cherkasov or Mindaugas on the finals, they are categories before him, and he's concentrating on his finals, normally, in the European Championship, and he doesn't watch so much the lightweight categories. I understand. I wasn't interested, I just focused on
Christo Del Gaco: not because he is not fan and because he is concentrating and he warming in this time and it's his fault yeah yeah but he says he's he's not uh during this sport he's not competing in armwrestling yeah yeah okay okay because because
Unknown: is not also following the youtube any videos that that's why i said that like he's not so much interested like except what he's doing and he's so focused and that's okay i will tell him the matches that he would like to like can he tell us anything about the serrano versus arif at them any any clue they will play in the right hand also yeah yeah right hand yeah
Sasho Andreev: Can you, Sasho, say something about Dzeranov and Arif Ertem? They are playing on the right-hand side. Do you have an opinion? In my opinion, more recently I have watched more Arif's matches. I don't have a very competent opinion about Dzeranov.
Sasho Andreev: I don't know the weight difference between him and Dzeranov. Dzeranov is usually lighter. There is probably a 20 kg difference between him and Ertem. I would rather express my opinion when I try both of them. But still, the Russian championship now looks pretty good.
Unknown: I'm not sure I must translate everything you know. I asked him and
Christo Del Gaco: i say probably they have a 20 kilos difference in the weight yeah yeah mri and um he say it's um um he cannot say like this because um he he watched the most matches of um uh if uh not for zero and because the round wasn't competing long time yeah and uh
Christo Del Gaco: but actually he can say something about some of the athletes after when he pulled with them you know if he catch them just to try it and pull with them he can say after that who is stronger um
Unknown: yeah we have we have a super chat the greatest person in the chat he's saying that you know like you don't need to really know every match just give your uh simple
Unknown: prediction you know i i think sasha is a perfectionist that he doesn't want to make a mistake you know with his prediction how i understand you know yeah yeah okay basically what is it that you know like he was doing it he doesn't need to really tell a lot you know he just he can think that this guy is favorite this guy is yeah he started with that it's uh he's heavier he's like the last match he said who is to have a strong resource on the
Christo Del Gaco: Okay, Sasho, just say who do you think will beat. From this match, who do you think will beat? Let's say Mindaugas and Cherkasov, who do you think will beat? Let's hope for a victory, but I wish success to both of them as a whole, because I don't have any ideas. Okay, and Dzeranov and Arif?
Christo Del Gaco: I guess Arif is very explosive and it's hard to stop him. I think so too. A few people can stop him. Okay, he said about the first... He said about the first match with
Christo Del Gaco: Mindaugas and Cherkasov. I asked about the prediction and he said, let's the strongest win. For the Dzeranov and Arif, he said, probably Arif will win because he's very explosive. I understand. And okay, it looks like he doesn't have so much. How about Zurab versus Rabvijan?
Sasho Andreev: Zurab Talberice vs. Zurab Vegeance. What do you think about this match? Yes, yes. When I played with Zurab, I felt him a lot stronger from the inside, but the control of the airwaves from above is good and his hand is quite uncomfortable,
Sasho Andreev: As far as I'm looking at the Russian, I think it's in pretty good shape. I don't know what the kilograms are, Rob. They should be in the same category. They are in the same kilos, however, they are in the same kilograms.
Sasho Andreev: I've felt a lot of control from Rob. He has a very uncomfortable and high hand, which I think is unpleasant for Zurab, but he's still focused on training for the catchers. It's interesting, but in my opinion Zurab is in a very strong form now. I wish him good luck on the double.
Christo Del Gaco: First of all, he's startling that he wished the success of the ball for competitors. But he said, Zurab now is in very good shape. He thinks Zurab is stronger. In hook, he feels Zurab very strong. When they play together in hook, Zurab is very, very strong. And also in the Russian Championship in Japan, he was in very, very good shape.
Christo Del Gaco: and this is what sasha said yeah yeah that's okay he's following someone i think that's good but but uh also he say uh rob beijing have a very long arm and uncomfortable uncomfortable for for a for uh zura because he will pull him wrist on the top row
Christo Del Gaco: uh of course europe is prepared for that he prepared for just for this because a lot of the competitors try to open his risk because the resource is not so big and he he he thinking europe will win but will be will be not easy you know it's okay okay i understand that this
Sasho Andreev: detailed analyzing yeah and and say he wished the success of the all of the both competitors you know it's um
Christo Del Gaco: He said Rob must be a little bit more focused on his technique because when they played together, he wasn't sure what he must do with Sasho. And now when he's competing with Rob, he hopes he's ready and he knows what he must do. I understand, yeah.
Unknown: yeah yeah it is yeah i understand um now i will ask him a match prediction but he's not gonna tell me the details nothing he will just say percentage he will say this guy is just say 55 this guy is 45 just example nothing no other answer i want only this one he's gonna say percentage so such andre versus pauline
Christo Del Gaco: Sasho, now I want you to answer him, but not to explain why and how, but just in percentages, what is your expectation? Sasho Andreev vs Paul Rhin, in percentages. Well, my expectation is to... Only in percentages, he doesn't explain anything else. What do you mean, in percentages? By chance?
Christo Del Gaco: In the beginning, we start with that he wants maximum and he gives for himself 100%.
Unknown: So he gives himself 100%. Yeah. Okay. At least he's 100% honest. He is not being political. He's not being nice or something. He believes this and he says that directly. Yeah, that's good, Sasho. I don't know if you can win or not, but that is good that you are just telling us whatever is in your mind, you know. You are not playing mind games. It's very important, yes. For me, it's super important.
Unknown: yeah yeah yeah yes i can yes yes sometimes people try to confuse opponents but when they do this too much they also confuse themselves you know and so but you are clear in your mind i don't know what's going to happen but okay on that way versus iraqli who is winning that you you pull against both of them you pull against on that way and you pull against iraqli but of course you were trying to hook them while
Unknown: they will go both top roll versus top roll. Who do you think is going to win? You sure they will top roll versus top roll? I'm not sure about it. I'm sure because I don't think that anyone can hook the other one. If somebody tries to hook the other one. I think we will see some dead risk technique actually. No, no, no. You can see dead risk only because top roll fails. Not because
Unknown: they will just directly go. Nobody is planning to go this. And Iraqis didn't plan this. He tried to top roll whenever he's responsible. He had to do this, not directly from the wrong one. Yes.
Christo Del Gaco: You need percent or everything? Whatever he wants to say. I said the other one for percentage because it's his match.
Sasho Andreev: I want him to be just clear, because we talked already about that match. Let him say whatever he wants, as detailed as possible, please. What do you think about this match in detail? As a whole, when I played with Ongarbaev, I had a lot of sub-control in the kick and rotation. And I think that Ongarbaev finds it very unpleasant to play with a player who plays from the inside, except for me.
Sasho Andreev: If I want to say something, it can take a long time to explain. But this is for Urgan Baev, for Irakli? For Irakli, he is a striker and he has trained a lot in the heavy levand. And his control in the throw is much better.
Sasho Andreev: I guess Irakli, but it depends on his form. I played with Ongarbaev a long time ago and I can't give such a competent opinion, but Irakli's overall control is better. Sasho said he thinks Irakli will be a little bit better because he has stronger wrist control.
Christo Del Gaco: Of course, Saar should compete with Urgan Bayev before many years, but he feels his wrist is not so strong, and against top rollers, Kyrgyz Genadi is not so good. That's what he's thinking, and thinking he'd see Rakly have a very good wrist control because he's training with, and at this point he said, how was the name of this guy's heaviest? Ah, Levan.
Unknown: Did he watch the match between Irakli and Djokovic?
Christo Del Gaco: Yes, this time yes. How many matches have you watched? Dave you watched the matches between Urgambaev and John Brzenk and Urgambaev and Michael Todd? Only with Michael Todd have I watched the matches with Brzenk, by the way.
Unknown: he say only with michael todd with brazil he didn't see it oh he saw michael too yeah also uh big john uh three one he one round he lost the other three rounds he toppled john's wrist
Christo Del Gaco: When he played with Ongarbaev, he lost 3-1. Ongarbaev and John 3-1. The first one lost, he didn't get the title, and the next three, he took John's title and lost. In that case...
Sasho Andreev: In this case, with this info, Sasho thinking will be very, very interesting match. And I told him it's maybe 50-50. He said, yeah, probably right. You're right. He said 50-50.
Unknown: because every every knows the control of the present of the matches and how strong is he yeah yeah yeah yeah and and another question for him uh does he have a dream super match he wants someone specifically
Christo Del Gaco: Sasho, do you have a dream super match, someone you want to play with? Let me imagine how I expect this match and then I would give a concrete answer to this question. Let's show what he does in this match and to win this match and after that he will tell you.
Unknown: okay okay because like for me it doesn't matter if he wins this match if he lose this match he will be invited as long as he wishes to be part of it you know so i didn't really mean to say that like if he wins this match or something you know but like even he loses or something if there is any match that he would love to have uh then it would be a good match like what does he think about
Christo Del Gaco: Maybe someday he vs. Alizhan Muratov with left arm. Is he ready for that match? 95 kg. Am I ready? It doesn't matter if you are ready or not, you will be. Even if you lose this match, you will be punished again to fight, because he wants to be a part of it.
Sasho Andreev: I am asking if you are ready for such a match on the left-hand side with Alizhan Muratov at 95 kg. Yes, I am ready. I know I have enough time to lift a few more kg, because I will be affected by the strength of this lift. I just want to have the time between the European and the World to lift these kg, especially.
Christo Del Gaco: He said he's ready. Just for him, it's important to gain this 5 kilos more. And I hope he has enough time under the World and European Championships to have enough time to work more. Yes. See, this year we have European Championships at the end of June. And then the World Championships at the end of August, I think.
Christo Del Gaco: Does he think that he may be ready for October? Like maybe end of October? When is the World Championship?
Christo Del Gaco: i think end of august but after that i think there will be i think in saudi arabia there will be something like world cup or something there will be i don't exactly know where but maybe category is not 90 i don't know it's uh
Christo Del Gaco: Or January would be the best.
Sasho Andreev: There are places where I feel a lot more control to my right, because I hope I don't have any injuries. Now the right one has pulled me back a lot, but I think things are getting even.
Christo Del Gaco: uh he say if he have enough time to recover to feel good to training good he's okay to make this much um and um also he's thinking october or january yeah probably will be january will be better on january and his his his left he said his left arm is he feels stronger of the right arm he have better control in the left arm because he was an injury on the right and
Christo Del Gaco: he's already covered the injury but it's not in the the best best shape like i compared the left arm but because of that he was injured he trained his right arm in the different way and he have a different strong sides
Unknown: of his right arm okay from that what i understand is a very strong tornado outside pull that which he was already capable of doing it he even showed in later rounds against iraqi in istanbul yeah that's what comes to my mind you know what
Christo Del Gaco: I can't wait. It's only like 10 days later everyone will be here and then we will just boom. Yeah.
Unknown: That's great. His injury was with his chest, right? Yes. Yes, yes.
Christo Del Gaco: It's a long time he has a strong pain, not so strong but uncomfortable pain in the chest and he cannot make his side pressure so good. He cannot train the side pressure.
Christo Del Gaco: But at the WAF or something he is still able to do it, but maybe it was not his level of competition.
Christo Del Gaco: After strong pushing, after that few days, he felt the pain in the chest also. It doesn't matter. He still does? Wow. But now, no, not now. Now, no? No.
Unknown: now not now not okay if he doesn't feel pain why does he continue doing his own style that he went outside if he because he doesn't need or uh no no he he training code side pressure he's okay inside pressure too oh he's okay so he's thinking about the past that he couldn't train for some time yes yes yes yes yeah yeah
Unknown: Anyway, so that is what I needed to know. He's ready. He gives himself 100% winning chance. And he doesn't want to make the same mistake he did with Irakli. He has a very tough, very explosive opponent. I wish them... After you told him about the last match, did you watch, Sasho, Rustem versus Paul video? Did you watch?
Christo Del Gaco: He said only in TikTok he watched how Babaev injured his chest. Only shorts, you know.
Sasho Andreev: the full match. Okay, I understand. Does he have a job or he only concentrates on armwrestling and sports? Do you have a job or do you only work with Canadian wrestling? At the moment I have a gym for now. I'm waiting for a job. But yes, I have a gym.
Christo Del Gaco: from last year to now he have a um gym he have a he's owner of the gym and that's what he worked but actually like an owner of the gym he have enough time to training but sometimes
Unknown: Before that, he only competed in armwrestling, but now he has some business in this, but it's not so much. Yeah, so his business doesn't really disturb his armwrestling because it's a gym that he can train and everything. Yeah, business and his support is going together, yeah.
Unknown: understand anyway so uh thank you very much it is an honor to have you in istanbul at the east versus west stage you are a legend of our sports and we will be honored uh you competing against someone really super strong pauline i don't know who's gonna win i just can't wait i just can't and christo thank you very much for being part of the
Unknown: You are one of the most knowledgeable guys, but in this case, since you are a referee, I don't want your prediction. People will call, like, oh, he's a referee, and he's going to... You understand? So, just... Once again... They will understand. From the Canadian side, they will understand who is stronger, in terms of the reality.
Christo Del Gaco: he say who understand of farm wrestling and he's um they will understand who is stronger even if the uh if even if the referee make mistake everybody will understand who who is stronger yeah yeah I understand but if here is the referee at this versus West and if he tells his opinion about this match this guy is gonna win
Unknown: and then people will start talking because they are already looking uh a mistake to throw mud you know like to east versus west they all the time do this not everyone maybe two percent they are like we call them haters toxic people so i i don't really need to feed them you know yeah so thank you very much once again for your presence and i am also honored to have you one of the best referees in the world to be
