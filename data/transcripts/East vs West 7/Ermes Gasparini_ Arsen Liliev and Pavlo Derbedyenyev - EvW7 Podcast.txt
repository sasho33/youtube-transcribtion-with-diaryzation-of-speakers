SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: hello guys hello hello hello good to see you all
SPEAKER_04: okay guys i will ask you a minute to quickly for the testing and then i'll be back in a minute
SPEAKER_04: okay guys hey hello guys
SPEAKER_04: Okay guys. Hello everyone.
SPEAKER_04: Ah, I don't know if Devon will fall into the same trap again, you know, about the haircut. So, I really don't know.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Anselm Lillie will be joining soon. He may be a little bit late.
SPEAKER_04: i don't know when i get the haircuts which is when the weather is getting warm hello hello hello hello guys okay i think somebody's coming first person my guess oh it's arson
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Arsene, how are you? Okay, how many of you here have been winning in our message? Haircut is the most important, my friends, but you need to be very careful about how you
SPEAKER_01: do your haircut. If you do wrong, then it takes 20% off from you. If you do the right haircut, it gives you 10%, so it's very risky. Thank you, Paul. Thank you. I'm not sure if Artin is going to come.
SPEAKER_04: Hello to Ontario. Yeah, beard is the same way. It depends on how you shape it. Yeah, I need to, I need to really, this time I cannot deceive him.
SPEAKER_04: this time, I don't think that he would fall into the same trap again. So we need to be, we need to find, I need to be more open and honest with him and say this. If you win, I take it as a haircut. And if you lose, I take it as a haircut, you know, then, then there will be very fair agreements.
SPEAKER_04: I'm trying to convince Arsene forever. Thank you Marge. When I was young, I had nice hair, so not anymore. How are you feeling my friend with Ramadan? Ramadan is good. It is making my blood pressure go down.
SPEAKER_04: But when you eat and go to bed, then sometimes it hurts my stomach. Maybe you turn the sound on, Arsene.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. No, I'm not gonna cut his hair. What's up, Nick? They're 120 kilo. No, that one is 130 kilo. Trust me. That was one of the best top rollers ever. I don't know what that means. I won't.
SPEAKER_01: How does your Ramadan affect your weight, your energy? Do you feel better? I don't know. I feel less inflammation. And I feel stronger. Every Ramadan is the same. When I fast, I feel stronger. I don't know why this is happening. I think Paolo came. Hello, Paolo. How are you, Engin?

SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes, Degurov, Sarmat Degurov. Yeah, yeah. How did it happen that he won dominantly at the AMC event and he lost at the Russian Nationals to Zolev? Zolev just dominated him. There is only like, what, two weeks in between? Hello, everyone. You guys ever met each other?
SPEAKER_01: Never. I never met Arsene. It's a very pleasure for me to speak with him and Pablo too. For me, you guys are the same thing for me. He was at that time a young hope for armwrestling. You are today a really young hope for armwrestling. I always have some favorite armwrestlers throughout the case.

SPEAKER_01: Be in your prime time. And just imagine all the other guys now. Irakli, John, Ongarbe, Zurab, and other guys. Would you beat those guys? Just don't be like so nice or something. Would you beat them in your prime?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, as far as I think, I think I can always beat everyone, except, probably, Saginashvili. I wouldn't beat him. Otherwise, I would beat everyone he listed, and it would be a tough match with Hermes.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, Arsen said that he would definitely win all of the mentioned above names. He would not win with Saganashvili, with Levan, and it's going to be probably a tough match with Hermes.
SPEAKER_02: oh he's talking about the super heavyweight i thought we are only talking about 105 kilo oh it's no problem again 95 95 kilograms june brazil then i for all times i think 95 kilograms this shape they shape what was in bulgaria the top bossing or r5 r5 you will what under two kilo under two kilo
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, Engin. Pasha, translate, please. There I weighed exactly 100 kilograms, because I arrived, flew there, I had 500 grams extra. And all the athletes were not against me weighing 500 grams extra, except for Kostadinov. He asked me to lose up to 100 kilograms.
SPEAKER_03: okay he was exactly 100 kilos uh he flow flew there with uh 500 grams over that weight and uh all the athletes says it's okay no problem don't worry about those half a kilo except the costadinov costadinov asked him to drop those 500 grams so he did it and he weighs exactly at 100 kilos i understand i understand
SPEAKER_03: And that day you looked very dangerous. I remember, I remember. And are you going to come back? He says, you were very dangerous. And then he asks, will you come back? Are you coming back?
SPEAKER_03: uh okay so he he just came back from a russian championship and uh hear this question probably 2 000 times and his answer to everybody was all the questions to my promoter and in turkey
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, even Engin Terzi himself doesn't know. I don't even know how am I going to answer.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so Engin, he's asking you as his promoter to talk about compensation for the next tournament which he's going to attend. What do you mean exactly?
SPEAKER_02: So, so, so, so. And the change.
SPEAKER_03: okay so uh he said engen you as his promoter have to decide which next tournament you're going to participate you will tell him and you are going to manage all the uh negotiation with the organizers about his compensation okay i'm gonna talk with the organizer as his manager just one second and you can tell him i want i want to set uh
SPEAKER_01: um i want uh arson you have to compete my event what can we do uh it depends on your offers yeah yeah i mean i kind of feel like he's gonna come back
SPEAKER_02: so i said i said that only one man on this planet can can smoke there is only one man on this planet who can make him come back in jersey okay i think you need to get up can you get up one second can you get up yes yeah you get up
SPEAKER_01: Now open your legs, open your legs like this, wide. And put your hands in between. Come back. The end of year you came. The end of this year. At the end of the year you can come back.
SPEAKER_02: yes but he never pulled with the voivoda him you know no no no no before never last time he was very young 17 18 years old yes and i was 17 kilograms i think 70 kilograms and the larat
SPEAKER_01: no no but almost i almost set them almost almost i almost set them and then lana couldn't pull and john replaced him and arsene arsene won yeah am i turkey turkey when he wants he won with john yeah yes i won first time i won travis bergens and then i won john brazil yes
SPEAKER_01: may change in one day no no no it's different different competitions yes okay and let's go hermes how are you how is your shoulder perfect perfect 98 98 but will you feel the same when very boom your arms
SPEAKER_01: Poor Jerry, my friend. Poor Jerry. I will break everything. You will see, like a kid. You know, play like with a kid. I mean, you know, we are friends. We are friends. We are good friends. So the friends always say the bitter truth. I think Jerry is going to end your dreams.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah you you laugh like that but you know as a promoter i shouldn't say my opinion like this but you know i think cancel the match just tell me secretly just bring me high you know if you want me no no chance zero zero chance maybe maybe 99 will win 99
SPEAKER_02: 99%, but there is still 1%, yeah, I understand. We don't know. Yeah. Everything is not sure, the life, understand. But 99% is sure. Big, big, very big chance. I understand. So, let's see how it will be. I just can't wait because you talk a lot. He also tells me that he's going to destroy you.
SPEAKER_01: um so we will see i think i think i believe him more more because you you you struggle with david's shoulder pressure he he have the same power than david about shoulder pressure no no no the power here the side pressure he doesn't pull side pressure he just directly dives you know yeah
SPEAKER_02: But I will beat him in the hook. No, no. You'll beat him in the hook. Yeah, you see. Wow. Wow. No chance. We will see. And Arsene, how do you see that he versus Jerry will be?
SPEAKER_02: What do you think? Yes, I understand. Pasha, please translate. First of all, in this match, I will be cheering for Armrestnik, which means for Hermes. I once told Engin that I thought the most disgusting or the worst fight was with Michael Todd. But then I saw, as they say, Jerry Khodraty, and I realized that only Jerry Khodraty is worse than Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_03: okay uh yeah arsene said that he will uh cheer for arm wrestling means for hermes because uh in the early days he thought that the weirdest and the ugliest arm wrestling is uh became from michael todd but when he saw cherry pulling he said no worse than michael todd is only jerry
SPEAKER_01: his arm wrestling yes i said only about his style yes because he pulled in the top row super smart see yeah yeah very uh hermes is so smart so this is why he never pulls this way
SPEAKER_01: i love teasing you i love teasing you and you know that i'm joking you never take it seriously you know yeah uh mike nielsen thank you for your support one and a half percent chance for jerry he says um and and paulo how do you see a match between hermes and uh jerry
SPEAKER_03: uh i believe that ermus will win uh with a uh relatively high chances uh i would say 60 to 40 but uh jerry's style is uh really very uh weird and comfortable so if uh if ermus will make a mistake and will allow jerry to go to his sweet spot that's gonna be a very tough match so uh
SPEAKER_01: it's it's very much depends on how uh hermes will do his homework i understand i understand okay let's go let's go to the east east versus west matches um since you are from here you probably know both east and west guys like let's start with just say okay this match we don't know anything about bachelor saginashvili and he's gonna pull against adam borzenski
SPEAKER_01: and georgian guys are speaking so highly about but do you think it's possible an 18 years old kid 18 18 he was 14 years old in 2019 at the side table i saw him meeting the all the senior guys he was 14 only and now he's 18. do you think that someone and he doesn't even train with those top georgians he's from somewhere different like like different than all the georgians top georgians
SPEAKER_02: Do you think it's possible for this guy to just come to the East vs. West and not only beat someone like Adam Wozniacki? Do you think it's possible? For sure he has super genetic power. But in the competition he is very different. But I saw some matches, I don't know in Georgia, he won with the Georgian guy.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, left arm. Left arm. It was left arm, yeah. Right arm. How much is left arm? But he's still impressive. He's still impressive for... Yes, he is a little bit, yeah. And the American guy, the name is Adam. He's very super strong. Yeah, you saw him against Portugal.
SPEAKER_02: the bulgarian guy yeah yeah it was impressive yeah yeah i think we don't know but maybe adam have more chance to win because maybe have more experience you know or maybe because if you don't have a lot of matches you don't compete
SPEAKER_02: a lot of time, you are a lot nervous, you know, because the first time going east versus west is very difficult for the mind. For the pressure, you know? Yes, yes, yes. Even I saw you having pressure. Yeah, yeah. Every time. Yeah, you are like, you know... With Dave, with Dave Jaffe. Yeah, yeah, I remember, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And then you told me for only the... No, I don't remember. But I remember very beautiful words before the fight. Who said? Before the match with Dave. Who said it? I don't remember. If you want to win, you need to have... I don't know the words now.
SPEAKER_02: but yes i think adam will win only for this but i we don't know we don't know if i put some percent i put 50 50. so you are saying that adam is proving himself
SPEAKER_01: like by being in bojidar while we don't know about the other guys so it's not gonna be easy for him because the pressure on that stage is very a lot yeah yeah and arsene how do you do you know uh adam wardensky arsene no sir and i don't know these guys okay you you don't know the guy who beat bojidar uh the american guy with the glasses that you know he hold him on his bicep okay and paulo how do you see this what's your opinion about this
SPEAKER_03: uh yeah uh okay it's uh it's possible to go either way because there is a power and a huge power on the ready go on one side uh from georgia and uh if match if match is stopped then bojidar for sure will skip the boy uh if uh if i'm ready go for some reason uh it's gonna be uh
SPEAKER_03: yes if management is not pulling adam warson's he's pulling back yeah adam will win if the match stopped adam will win because endurance on his side definitely and he he will be favorite but uh there is a possibility that uh he gonna be smacked right to the bed i mean it's it's possible with the power that a georgian have you know signature they have that says it's very possible
SPEAKER_01: yeah and and what do you think about let's start from you uh brandon as a short versus samusha
SPEAKER_01: That's another great one. Brandon El Cesar will probably be the favorite in my eyes, but not by much. Not by much, yes. It's because of the low hand, the defensive up roll that David is attacking. You are thinking he may stack there, right? Like the same thing that when Craig was trying to hook him, but he just... I think stylistically, Brandon...
SPEAKER_03: very dangerous guy for david i mean if he can't recover he can be very dangerous yeah if if hook if hook versus hook it's different way but uh because of the styles yeah it's that's my opinion and arson do you know these guys brandon assessor
SPEAKER_02: Unfortunately, I don't know this guy. I will ask him the matches that he knows about. And Hermes, how do you see this? I think same to Pavlo. More or less. Oh, yeah? Same way, yes. Have you followed Brendan? Any of his matches? Not too much, but I saw him sometime and I think
SPEAKER_01: I think same to to power. Pablo Alarc?n Pe?a.: And let's go to. Pablo Alarc?n Pe?a.: Our team. Pablo Alarc?n Pe?a.: Rob vision juniors do you know Rob visions. Pablo Alarc?n Pe?a.: Yes, yes, yes, of course. Pablo Alarc?n Pe?a.: Okay let's go.
SPEAKER_02: Pasha, can you translate it, please? Well, first of all, it was a huge surprise for me. Zurab showed such a form at the tournament in Krasnoyarsk. He won quite easily, he won 95 kg. And it seems to me that Zurab is still adding from competition to competition. And it seems to me that Zurab will still be the favorite in this match.
SPEAKER_03: okay uh yeah he was uh very surprised uh the form uh zura brought to amc tournament he relatively easy won the class and uh tournament to tournament he's showing up better and better and he arsene said that the favorite in this match is i understand and what do you think paulo
SPEAKER_03: uh it's a little bit complicated to answer because of the uh rugby giant comeback he did not pull for years i'm not sure if he's constantly training which i don't believe so uh so uh he's very very uh naturally gifted arm wrestler with a large hands
SPEAKER_03: perfect control uh perfect biceps but i think that will uh that his uh break in uh uh tournaments and participation will uh will make it uh for him almost impossible to beat picking zero um whenever i offer him the match there was more than three months but he was already training
SPEAKER_01: i know i know but uh you know you you you cannot bring uh five six months cannot bring you to the forum you it was 10 years ago and zurab is peaking and he's in his shape uh not 10 years ago i think in even 2018 or something you know he was good just imagine about jerry cather people said the same exacting why do you give him a title match why do you give him a title match
SPEAKER_02: because he was like, and he just came and beat Gennady, you know, just like these guys. I mean, probably they know what to do. And how do you see that, Hermes? It was very impressive about the tournament in Russia. Super. Super. And I think he will win for sure. For sure. He's going to win for sure? Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe not easy, but... You are saying that his pressure is... The 95kg category in Russia is very hard to win this category. Yeah, I was surprised. All the champions are inside. Yeah, you're right. He won't be easy, but very convincing.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, this one I'm not going to answer. With the Russian guy, he won without the hand with the semifinal. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Without the hand. Yeah, yeah. Super, super, super.
SPEAKER_03: and that was paulo douglas versus uh daniel prokopchuk oh not predictable uh i would say daniel prokopchuk is the favorite but uh douglas brought uh last time he brought the form he surprised me to be honest so uh i still think that daniel prokopchuk is a favorite but probably not as heavy as i thought before you know douglas hermes he beat
SPEAKER_02: Coach Gray, last event, the first match. Yeah, Paul for his weight category. For me, he's very strong. Very... I don't know. There are different weights between these athletes or not. There are different weights or same category. Hanging. What's that?
SPEAKER_01: The match is 185, but I think Daniel will be 78, 79 kilos. And I think Douglas will be, in my opinion, like 83 kilos or something. Maybe 5 kilos heavier. But he's probably about 15 centimeters taller than Daniel. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think he is 6'1", while Daniel is somewhere around 170. Yeah, yeah. Armwrestling Derek, super. Thank you, my friend. All amazing legends on this video. Much respect. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Thank you for your support and see you very soon. Okay, let's go. Alejandro Murado versus Cody Merritt, Arsene.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. He knows the guys and he said that it's going to be a very close match and he doesn't know who can be a favorite one in this one. Wow. Okay. Okay. What does he think about Arizhan?
SPEAKER_01: he said that he is a strong guy and a very good athlete yeah yeah yeah by the way i made a poll on community page which card was or he is the best looking east versus west
SPEAKER_01: And then 66% voted for East versus West 7. Upcoming one will be the best. And 21% East versus West 5. So people are thinking that the upcoming is the better one than East versus West 5. The best among all. Every time is amazing. Yeah. Every time I can't wait to see this match. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I love it. I love it.
SPEAKER_01: I love it that you guys are just going there. I'm telling you something. To step up East versus West stage, you need to have really big balls. Right, yeah. Yeah. Really, that is, Neil has an event, it's called Reality Check. This is also really highest level Reality Check, where you find out many answers.
SPEAKER_02: May I answer? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so let's go. What do you think about this match? Alejandro versus Cody. Murato is super impressive. Super speed, super power. I think he will win, for sure. Okay. You think he's going to win? Yeah, super strong. You think Cody cannot top roll him? Maybe, but in the straps, I don't think.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so you are saying that Petrenko did without the strap? Whenever I see the round one, Ali Can attack and Petrenko just like lock him and then he... Yeah, but he came out every time here. Yeah, I was thinking that, wow, Petrenko is very strong. But once the strap was on, the thing changed. And then whenever I saw Ali Can, I was like, what is he doing? He goes hook, he goes side pressure.
SPEAKER_01: cannot stop it and then he goes to open himself and then suddenly he switches back to the shoulder pressure you know he just hook you know within the match he's just doing everything yeah yeah also we will talk about it but the one guy is the same way the guy is just at the table he is just like what are you chess player or our master you know like what are you yeah
SPEAKER_03: yeah and and you paulo how do you see cody uh versus cody is my friend but unfortunately i would say that alijan will win this time i saw him a few times pulling uh it's it's it's more than impressive i don't think that cody have uh good chances winning so i would say like 65 to 35 unfortunately interesting and
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's go to the... Are you my friend or not? What's that? Look at that. The quality power. We don't see your arm. I need to breathe. No, no, seriously, your arm is out. Look. Come, come, come. Only muscle, only muscle, no fat. Sorry, but it became so small. Why is it?
SPEAKER_02: The important is the quality power. No. It's small, small. It used to be big. Why is it small? No, not small. Very big. Is it? I don't know. It used to be a little bit small, yeah. So thank you. Can I take one question? And how is the weight, Hermes, now? Hermes' weight? In the morning, 126. Oh, very good. But I cut a lot.
SPEAKER_02: the diet, I cut, I eat less. And how was the weight of the past competition in Turkey? 100 in the afternoon, we did everything, 133, 132. But in the morning, I think it was 130.
SPEAKER_02: For me it's good, this weight, because I don't want to push too much and if I'm stronger every time, it's enough.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, but he says that before he was somewhere in the top 3. No, no, I understand everything, I understand everything, I want to say my own thing. Yes, yes, that I, of course, cannot advise anything to such a champion as Hermes, but in my opinion, it seems to me that exactly 125-123 kg, maybe, this would be for him, maybe,
SPEAKER_02: probably much better than when he was too big. Because when he fought in smaller weights, in my opinion, it was an ideal top roll. And maybe, like me, too big weight and big muscles prevent him from showing his technique.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Yeah, Arsene saying that maybe I cannot give any advice as the big champion like you, Hermes, but it's my opinion if you want to hear it. So he thinks that like 123 to 125 kg for you is ideal weight.
SPEAKER_03: and that's uh where are you the strongest the fastest and he saw uh almost ideal top roll from you at that weight because when you show up uh heavier it was not uh it was not good for you yeah yeah yeah I take every time to advise to everyone and not like you know I know everything and it just wants to put more power when he's facing big Giants what
SPEAKER_01: You just want more horsepower, you understand? Yeah, yeah. With your ways in big giants, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think your weight is 130 kilo. Yeah, yeah, more or less. And you proved that you don't need to become
SPEAKER_02: bigger just to be for the head for everything you know it's very dangerous to go maybe maybe if we go 140 150 but i am more strong about for for my head a long career no short and to stop immediately
SPEAKER_01: yeah and and arson you you coming back uh at 105 kg right when you put it east versus west yes yes
SPEAKER_01: Ah, he's come back for sure. He's recording now. He's recording now. Yeah, it was a trap, trap. I just put him, I pinch him and he just, you know. Don't forget what you just said. Okay. You need some help to me for putting this video everywhere? Just listen, listen. Listen. Hermes.
SPEAKER_01: I know his manager very well. For sure, I will make an agreement with him. But who is his manager? I love crops. Ah, you? Okay. I'm the organizer of East vs. West, and he just appointed me as his manager. So I will talk with his manager. I will make an agreement. I don't need a very cheap agreement, you know, very cheap since I'm the manager.
SPEAKER_02: Pasha, please translate. We are all fans of armwrestling and for us the prize money is not that important.
SPEAKER_03: yeah I've said yeah I agree with our sentence saying that we are all big fans of arm wrestling of our sport and it's not that important to receive uh some exact amount of money but uh to participate and uh to be yeah how many centimeters he was in the forum and beside
SPEAKER_01: too big. There was no tape measure. You have a photo, his forearm is like this.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. How many stevers do you have? Without training, no pass, without practice. I understand, I understand. Pasha, please translate. I can't say because everyone measures differently. Some measure with their arms stretched out, some measure like Taras measured. But if you measure like this, I think it was about 48 or 49 seconds.
SPEAKER_03: okay okay yeah he's saying that uh everybody's measuring differently but uh if to measure it uh in uh you know angles it was like 49 or just under 50. yeah so beside yeah his forearm was about the same size he's asking his biceps same uh
SPEAKER_02: yes 49 and the but the bishop is more 50 54 52 maximum 53. oh yeah and imagine he was around 100 kilo yeah yeah and there is a super set silky will be thank you for your support if saur got his tendon reattached
SPEAKER_02: to be shorter, is it technically an actual T-Rex? T-Rex? Yeah. Paolo, what do you think? I don't know. I show now the videos.
SPEAKER_02: He pulled 90 kilos 20 times like this. He already started doing bicycle? Yeah, 90 kilos 15 times, 20 times. When did he get healed up? I showed the video about two days ago, three days ago. Wow. He's already strong. Wow. I think he was foreign. He is.
SPEAKER_02: Just lift up a little bit. We can see. Beautiful, huh? Oh, yeah. Yes, but it took 10 years, 10 years without trains, 10 years. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But Dimash will have the memory. He will come back immediately. Quick, quick, yeah. I'm asking Derek. Thank you for your support. Artsen versus Irakli. East versus West.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't think Arsene can beat you like this, so maybe another time. Ernest, whatever I do to you, I also do to Arsene. Because you both have respect for me, and because I'm older, I like to tease you guys. How old are you, Arsene?
SPEAKER_02: How old is Letterson? He's very young. He said that he started winning too early, so he finished early.
SPEAKER_01: 2005 to 2013, it was like, okay, you know, you know, and eight years, he just did things that people couldn't do in 20 years, you know? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Elgin, now... Oh, yes. Pasha, speak, please. Now we were sitting at the Russian Championship. For some reason, I was very interested in Elgin Terzi's opinion. Now we were at the Russian Championship, and many people had such a question. Top, when I fought at 75 kg, it was with Tsvetan Goshevsky, Nemirov, and the top now is Alan Zoloyev. What is his opinion? Indeed, exactly 75-78 kg. I and Alan Zoloyev, his opinion. I'm just interested.
SPEAKER_03: uh Ingen here have a question to you uh because they've been sitting at the Russian national tournament and been talking about uh 75 78 kilos uh and uh uh what your opinion between uh Alonzo life and uh arsene himself oh you know arsene no no no question now serious
SPEAKER_01: Arsene, in his prime, just say 2007 Zloty Arsene. I don't think that there is any human being that could ever beat him at that weight, in my opinion. Okay, thank you. No, it's just my opinion. I wrote this. I'm not saying only because of your face, but Silky Milky,
SPEAKER_01: Come on, man. He's struggling with it. Even the young youth guy, you know, of course he won, but whenever he tried to go, his wrist went back. Your students, you know, he was not that easy. I saw the final match. He had the control, but he lost his wrist while one time he attempts, you know, just you were so dominant on those years. You were just holding everyone and beating like this. I mean, I remember Yon Sesku was 100 kg. Yeah. And you just hold him, hold him and
SPEAKER_01: won't you know after the event i ref you and john you guys just slow start but you slowly slowly if i am not mistaking you took his wrist you know um yeah of course john would beat you john would beat you but even you to be dead light and still even with a slow start causing him some problems he was impressive yeah still he will keep
SPEAKER_03: i think the correct way to measure elbow or forearm largeness should be to immerse the arm in water and measure the displacement did you understand this all yes yes okay what do you think so basically you have a bucket uh full of water inserted in a wider bucket empty and you put your arm into that and then measure the amount of water splashed into the bigger bucket
SPEAKER_01: so your your forearm and elbow will be measured in liters yeah yeah yeah anyway so let's continue with the east versus west arif artem versus the zelano hermes arif because he i i remember is very fast the the start
SPEAKER_02: And he has a lot of pressure. He will win quickly in this position, I think. And what do you think, Arsene?
SPEAKER_02: You know this, I don't know, right? Yes, yes, yes, yes, of course. Both, or rather not so. Arif, how many times I watched his fights, I honestly say, how many times I thought that he would lose. But he always won. Therefore, Arif and Dzerav, they can always be surprised. I don't know in what form they will be both, but still, it seems to me, Arif is the favorite. He is very, very, very fast for a heavyweight athlete.
SPEAKER_03: yeah he said that uh every time i've been watching karif's uh matches i always thought that he gonna lose and he always won so he said this time once again not always it's it's it's only about the matches he watched okay
SPEAKER_03: okay okay but anyways you know so it doesn't count it doesn't count so uh uh he said both athletes can impress us but he think this time uh arif is a favorite because of his speed for super heavyweight and uh oh he's thinking he's gonna beat this i don't know
SPEAKER_02: yeah and then how do you see this match paulo yes anyway same way uh zerenov is a very good athlete and he he can impress us but arif is probably too fast for him if you show a lot of time with the guy he lost because uh
SPEAKER_01: He lost because he started very, very quickly, very fast. I think Arif is faster than Kalnichenko, in my opinion. He's probably faster. Arif is like my brother, you know. But, you know, I'm an organizer. I don't know Arif. He sent me his forearm and bicep. He has never been this big. He sent me the pictures of his bicep. But then I saw...
SPEAKER_01: this i don't know did you see with the dumbbell what he's doing no i mean he was holding like 55 kilo dumbbell on the bench and he was coming forwards and lifting up like forward 55 kilo dumbbell he was doing that that level for you is harder to do this i mean this is not like a belt hanging here and then just doing this but he was just like doing many reps with the dumbbell holding you know it's just yeah
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. Yeah, I see Ermas' face expression because, come on, it's easy. I mean, I mean, I mean. I mean, I think Ermas cannot do that. But anyway, so. Really? Now put some money and I'll show you tomorrow. Can you believe that he is just... With the 70 kilos. He never stops seeing me as the ATM machine.
SPEAKER_01: Every time he wants to do something, we only see those American dollars cash. He's like, put some money. You're teasing. You are rich. Engin, you deserve it. You're teasing him. I'm witness. You're teasing him every time. Anyways, yeah, we are joking, yeah. Okay, then let's go to another one. Pauline versus Sasho.
SPEAKER_02: Let's start with Arsene. I think there's no chance here. I'm sorry for the North American audience, but I don't think there will be any problems here. He's a clear favorite. He will dominate every match and there will be absolutely 3-0 here.
SPEAKER_03: uh yeah arsene saying that uh there is uh not a chance he will dominate in all all the matches and uh yes ashore will win dominantly three zero oh yeah you think so that's what he said how do you see this paulo well uh it's uh i believe that sasho is uh favorite but i uh
SPEAKER_01: i saw the match with rustam and i understand that rustam get injured but rustam get injured in a position where uh paul was really holding him in neutral position i i think i think my opinion paul really locked rustam in that position and then rustam wanted to go he couldn't go and then whenever paul hit him and there rustam got injured i'm not saying that paul
SPEAKER_02: could have won that, but that match showed. Yeah, it showed something. Engie, you have to understand, Pasha, that Babaev's hook and Sasha's hook are different things. And I say it again, it's my opinion that Paul Lynch can stop such a deep hook when he's fighting bone to bone.
SPEAKER_03: okay uh yeah arsene saying that uh that his opinion only but we have to understand that babaev's hook and sasha's hook are different hooks and he believes that pauline will not be able to stop it when it's so deep and squeezed inside i think same if he will win only if he started he will start
SPEAKER_02: very fast maybe not in the inside the hook where inside but like this no no like side pressure not a problem but in between like this but if he will go like this uh
SPEAKER_03: I I believe that uh both guys have uh have uh opinions and then uh they're they're right there there is one but that Pauline have the tools and he may
SPEAKER_03: may separate sasho's angle i'm not saying that this is happening but he have a chance he may separate sasho's angles on the start a little bit to prevent him from going into that deep deep squeezing hook and then match can go different direction but yes i agree that sasho is the favorite i understand okay let's go to the next one uh vitaly lalechin tobias forung arsene
SPEAKER_02: I think this match will be very interesting for me because Tobias is probably one of the fastest-growing PGA now, but Vitaly has a lot of performance experience and here it is really difficult for me to answer.
SPEAKER_02: It will be a very interesting match. I don't know if Tobias will add as quickly as he did before and progress. Maybe Vitaly will have problems. Because Vitaly is also not used to fighting with such a long arm as his opponent.
SPEAKER_02: Here, I don't know, the chances are very equal, and it seems to me that all this will end anyway. Rather, we will raise the winner of this match after the first round. There will be no hard fights, there will be no difficult fights. After the first round, we will definitely know who will win the whole match. Okay, so Arsen is saying that this is a very, very interesting match. And if Tobias is progressing at the same speed as he used to,
SPEAKER_03: uh that he he cannot even predict that uh to one side or another vitaly have more uh experience but it's not going to be any prolongated uh pulling it's most likely going to be pretty fast matches but after the first match we will know and vitaly may have a problems because he not used to pull a lot of opponents with the same almost same lengths of the arm as his own arm
SPEAKER_01: See, Arsene, he's from the same country as Vitaly, but he's having very objective opinion. It doesn't mean that Vitaly can now win easy or something. As he said, he will go either way. But him to say that Tobias has also chance to win. I mean, because, you know, Arsene is the top roller.
SPEAKER_02: when somebody is pulling like this you know and then you have like this kind of very strong yeah this is the key of the match yeah because like this he not have he don't have a lot of advantage to
SPEAKER_01: to be yeah because because 19 is usually pulling against shorter guys who are trying to hook me yes yes yes he got used to pulling this way but even he does this he is still very high you know yeah but yes yes he lost his wrist with the top roller like this yeah there are there are times you have more control if you if your wrist is up here and also you have more power here
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and Tobias also has a very strong hand. You remember that when Morozov tried to top roll him, he easily, easily took him down and Morozov hardly sweep his hand, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Pasha, please translate. Can I explain? As a former top-roller who fought with Vitaly, I want to answer the first part. If we are from the same country, we have an expert opinion and it doesn't matter if we are from the same country or not. I will try to be absolutely objective. As for the fight, when I fought with Vitaly and with any top-roller who held
SPEAKER_02: I started in this position. For me it was...
SPEAKER_02: You can say that they were like buns. They were the most comfortable opponents for me. And for a good top fighter who has control of the strength of the wrist, he is probably the most comfortable opponent. That's why Vitaly likes to fight like that. He has always been very comfortable for me, it was easy for me to fight with him. But at the same time, he has now increased a lot, so I don't know, 50 to 50.
SPEAKER_03: okay so arsene saying that uh doesn't matter that we are from the same country we have to be objective and we have to uh give our honest opinions and he said that uh his opinion that uh vitaly may have a problem there because exactly because of the style style vitaly is pulling like that and our sense said when i've been pulling vitaly that was the best opponent for me it was like comfortable right very comfortable yes yes yes thank you yeah
SPEAKER_01: That's why every time Arsene meets Vitaly, he was just beating him. Of course, that time he was lighter, but still, stylistically, he was very comfortable. And Hermes, how do you see? You said that... Yeah, yes, I think the same as Arsene. Same like me when I met Larit in Dubai, when they pulled him with a whip.
SPEAKER_02: I felt very comfortable in this position. I understand, yeah. Sometimes we have a lot of strong arms, super strong, but here, for us, me and Arsene, we are more advantage for the style. Yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry. It's okay, it's okay.
SPEAKER_02: That's what I'm saying, that him and Hermes having very similar styles. And yes, with Vitaly, Hermes would be probably very comfortable same as him.
SPEAKER_01: and that's my understanding. Okay, there are superchats. Armless Indirect, thank you for your superchat. How many people besides Arsene ever top-rolled Denis's wrist? Very few people. Yeah, but Arsene will also say to you that when Arsene top-rolled Denis, Denis was a little bit tired, right, Arsene?
SPEAKER_01: yes yes of course yes you told me one time that you said that you were in your best best ever shape best you went there to beat dennis and you said that you hit him the first
SPEAKER_01: and he beat you in like one second like nothing you you felt like you hit a bus or something and you said that next a few days you had so much pain you know you never felt power like this you you remember you know i have pain i have pain in my legs no and shoulder no in my back oh my legs
SPEAKER_02: Yes, Pasha, please translate. It was something like a tank or a tram moved over me. We fought on our hands, but my whole body was hurting.
SPEAKER_01: he said that yeah we've been pulling kind of arms but uh uh the feeling was like the train ran over me it was amazing how uh the whole body i saw the video yeah i saw the video he really liked it was like boom boom like this yeah but he was 140 kilo and just pure muscle yeah even that that shape of dennis would kill hermes casparini it's different subject anyway so
SPEAKER_01: i want a match with daniel engen put some money and you will see no yeah yeah i i'm like that story i'm a cheap guy i never put money and i want to see the matches yeah we really do we want to see people thank you for your super chat pablo looks like he is a person you can trust in life life
SPEAKER_01: thank you uh thank you for supporting us roman sg records says where did it go hermes will fancy gladiator versus russian hulk we just talked about this yeah yeah okay which match we were talking about yeah the the guy yeah the obvious versus so let's go to the last two matches iraqli zirakashvili
SPEAKER_02: Super fight. Super. This is super. I came with super. This is very, very big fight. Okay, let's go. I think Iroquois have more power here, more back pressure.
SPEAKER_02: But on Garbaia, I have more technique in the top row. And here, which one will be more important? Technique or more power? Control or power? I think in this trap, the power is more important. So you are saying that Iraq has a good chance of winning? More. That's interesting. Majority?
SPEAKER_01: thinking that Ungarwe will win. But there are people that, like John also said, that there is a possibility for Irakli to win, but he should not try to control, but just go for directly pure power, as far as I remember. And so we will see. We will see. It's incredible. Like those two guys, they are both under 30 years old and like already at the top of the world.
SPEAKER_01: and that's that's incredible that's incredible and i have a question for you like do you think that hashings because of his style could still be problem for iraqi or iraqi leveled up well now i think i level up yeah but i don't think we go same last time
SPEAKER_01: But no easy match for a bot, I think. He's super strong here, but he doesn't have a lot of power, side pressure. Yeah, but last match against Jon, you remember the round one, you went like right here, Jon barely stopped him, and then his wrist kind of... But his pressure was... A rematch with Todačić and Irakli would be super.
SPEAKER_01: good one right because now directly has good good better endurance yeah who would think that
SPEAKER_01: He needs this rematch. We will see. Let's go step by step. Whenever I said all these matches, people were saying, you said in so many matches, there will be no more matches. Come on, more we do. More new stories are coming. There are a lot of combinations. Yes, yes. Things are changing as well.
SPEAKER_01: bionic down flexman not much but i try to give a bit to everyone thank you and thank you very much for your support my friends and arson what do you think this is your category you know you know that yeah soon or late you're gonna face these guys and they will crush you you know that right
SPEAKER_01: Look at how Hermes is feeling because Hermes knows what they're feeling. Go ahead, Arsene, go ahead.
SPEAKER_03: Pasha, come here please. I have a feeling that Engin is just joking and teasing me and Hermes in this sport. The two of us are the same. Okay, so Arsen is saying that you, Engin, that he has a feeling that you, Engin, are joking and teasing only Arsen and Hermes in this sport. And almost the same. Yeah, yes, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_01: Because I feel them close to me, you understand? Very close friends. And I know that they respect me. I respect them as well. So I feel close. I like to tease them. I just say, I don't say this kind of thing. You will not hear me saying this guy is going to win. Only I say to Hermes that somebody is going to destroy him. And he knows that I'm just joking with him, not serious. Yes, of course.
SPEAKER_02: And what is your opinion, Arsen, on Garbaev and Irakli? This is probably the only match I would never bet a ruble on, let's say a dollar, because it's a very difficult match.
SPEAKER_02: As Hermes said, it's really a huge strength for this weight category against technique. And as I call Amgarbaev, it's probably the heart of a warrior who never gives up and can fight any opponent and not be afraid of him. A very difficult match and 50-50, but in my opinion, it can be 55-45 in favor of Amgarbaev due to a longer arm and maybe he
SPEAKER_02: In the first two matches, for example, he will lose, but then he will be more resilient and his opponent's wrist will get tired. Therefore, 55, not even 50, 51-49 in favor of Gorbaev.
SPEAKER_02: Now I'll try to remember it all. Pasha, you're the perfect translator. I'm going to ask Engin, I wanted to say this at the end, but as accurate as you convey everything that I say, this huge text, thank you very much, and I've never done this before. Thank you very much. Yes, yes, this is only for you.
SPEAKER_03: so our sense say that uh this is one of the matches he will not bet a ruble or a dollar for because he's waiting for the match the same as ermus and it's a lot of power for this weight class and this is one of the best and uh um he's saying that possibly there is a 51 to 49 percent uh in favor it will be on garbaev because of the uh
SPEAKER_01: forearm and arm length, maybe a little bit. Yeah, but just tell him that the Irakli is taller than Ungarwe.
SPEAKER_03: That's what Arsen says. Plus, he said that maybe Irakli will win first two matches, and it's possible. But then, because of the endurance of Angerbaev, he may start cracking his wrist open, and Irakli's wrist may get tired. That's why he's giving 1% towards Angerbaev. And what do you think, Pavlo?
SPEAKER_01: uh i would probably agree with our son it's i want to see this match definitely this is my weight also i mean almost i can try yeah yeah you're gonna make 231 right yes yes oh i think my idea your possible future opponents right there sitting paulo
SPEAKER_03: don't listen to him he said even if i will come back i will never pull you after uh the perfect translation you're doing for me but anyway yeah uh
SPEAKER_03: i believe that anger have a little bit more tools than iraqi but iraqi is super fast and he's improving very fast and he's uh he's doing uh he's impressing us every time so i don't know i want to see this uh match i don't want to pull any of those guys to be honest because my chances are like half a percent come on more confidence more confidence that's a lot of power like we have we have three champions here and one
SPEAKER_01: doesn't trust himself like fourth one come on come on paulo let me tease you a little bit as well like one there is one guy said that like i motivate and like i'm motivated same time no every time i told them like um my friend if one guy is five centimeters taller than the other guy i don't think that the guy five centimeters shorter will have the arm height we don't know that at least you know
SPEAKER_01: there is nothing that to prove that whatever this is what one guy and uh let's talk about the last match there is one guy is asking if Hermes is interested to pull Zaur my friend Hermes was set to pull Zaur before Zaur got injured he was gonna pull in this May against Zaur anyways so uh let's talk about Arsene let's start with you Devon Larat versus Gennady Kuikvinya
SPEAKER_02: It's going to be a great match. I talked to Gennady the day before yesterday. He said he's in great shape. He's ready.
SPEAKER_02: It will be a very interesting fight, because both athletes can use any technique. For me, Gennady always remains one of my favorite athletes, due to his character, due to the fact that he can change his fight from fight to fight. But De Volorat is De Volorat. A very difficult match, but I will support Gennady.
SPEAKER_03: okay her sense saying that uh uh yeah it's another very interesting match and uh he's talking to Gennady and uh United said that he's ready for work he is in a very good shape uh and uh uh also saying that both of the athletes can use uh different techniques uh they are during some point but Devon is Devon and uh yeah they it can go either way but he will cheer for Gennady
SPEAKER_01: Okay, can you ask him, is there any possibility Gennady to have as good endurance as Devon has?
SPEAKER_02: This is probably another very difficult question in armwrestling. I really find it difficult to answer, because I say it again, he may be more resilient, but what Gennady can do due to his character and just not let go in the position that any other of us would have, perhaps, let go, makes Gennady a little higher.
SPEAKER_03: okay so uh he's saying basically that uh possibly that devon has a little bit better physical endurance but because of the character of the gennady he will never give up and uh because of that he may uh he probably will put him a little bit above them i understand when you pull against gennady it was gennady's returning match after a long time
SPEAKER_01: He was before injured. He was not confident. And right now he is in much better shape. I know you are also in much better shape right now. I'm not comparing you with him, but I'm 100% sure that Gennady that we will see against Devon will be much stronger, more confident than the one that Hupul against you. But from other side, I was doing the video chat with Devon. It was just different subject. He was like, hey,
SPEAKER_01: me show you something i was like okay and then he showed the scale he just he was just waking up you understand when i called him he was in the bed and he was opening his eyes and and then he went on scale he had the pants and t-shirts of course he's at home no shoe nothing he was uh 290.5 or something so he was like 131 and a half kilo let's say
SPEAKER_01: one and a half kilo on him just say because he's a big guy and said he was i think jade on him and he was 130 kilo so this is the biggest devon that we saw of course the weight alone doesn't really mean a lot but if you're talking about devon it means that you know he's taking gennady very seriously and he doesn't look at it at all what do you think about this much
SPEAKER_01: I think Devon has more endurance than Gennady for sure. Because Devon's endurance is super impressive. Okay, let me cut you here. Does it matter in what position the match goes? Just say the wrong one, they go inside. His endurance would still be good or him to have better endurance is up to put Gennady in a bad position.
SPEAKER_02: like this. I think it will be the same like when he fought with Bruce Lee. He will go down here and he will open something, the wrist of Gennady and he will stay in this position. Maybe Gennady, he will win
SPEAKER_02: when he has full power, maybe the first or the second round. But after this, the endurance of Davon will be dominant. But do you think that just because he has better endurance
SPEAKER_02: Is he going to do it? Or the matches will still be tough? Or you think he will just finish? Gennady will finish? Or still there will be some... Yeah, still tough, but... But I think Devon, he will win for his... If you compare the power, for sure Gennady have more power, I think. But you are saying that he won't be able to apply it? Because you hear this? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: he they will he will take history okay okay yeah yeah kimmy turner uh i think it's it may not be arsene's instagram but let me ask arsene do you have instagram no no no no you don't have right here okay this one is what i was thinking yeah that's not his instagram yeah just wanted to tell you guys okay so you guys are saying that
SPEAKER_00: Devon has more chance. Or Arsene said that it was 50-50. Arsene says that it's a little bit to Gennady's side. Oh, to Gennady's side? No, it's only about my heart, I think. Your mind? 50-50? 50-50, yes. And how would you say that? Devon is going to win? Devon is going to win.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, Hermes says Devon is going to win. Pavlos says Devon is going to win. I root for Gennady, but I think only with my mind. And I think Devon will be like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I'm happy if Devon will win because I want to crack his arm.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you don't want him to... I wait too much time now. I'm tired to wait. Okay, okay, okay, yeah. I don't know why he don't come to compete. How long I need to wait for this match? I understand, yeah. Now he's 230 kilos, perfect, or not? Yeah. I think, I think, I think, Hermes, I think that he sees you
SPEAKER_01: like a future legend and i think he doesn't want to hurt your feelings yet no i'm serious you know you don't take my image because too much scary you think you think you can beat him you think you can beat him this this finish yeah anyways so the notion to play that yeah anyways
SPEAKER_01: arsen after we finish we are finishing now i will i will talk with your managers and i will make the agreement with your managers and then you come into east versus west october i don't know i will talk with his manager yeah anyways thank you very much
SPEAKER_01: Hermes, thank you. Thank you too. Thank you, Arsene. Thank you, Paolo. Thank you, Paolo. It's good that you guys meet each other. Yeah, super. I'm very happy. I hope that you meet in real life as well. Yeah. Yeah. And then I hope that you also... I'm a big fan of Arsene. I show all of his videos. Yeah, when you were just... Yeah, when he was very young. Yeah. All of him. Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: yeah and now he's now he's watching you and there will be time you guys will meet at the table yeah i want to give you a compliment your english is improving day by day you're here you have a very good english by now ah thanks thanks i'm very happy you are also feel for this it is because he is smart smart my friend for this you have marty you know you
SPEAKER_02: You learn everything. I learned the flop press too. Which one is in here? English or flop press? You show me. I saw that. In the match I learned the flop press. I did this. He's flop pressing. It was a big surprise. Arsene, what did you think about Hermes versus Lewand? You were impressed? No.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, of course, I was very surprised, very surprised, yes, because when I told you this, Pasha, translate, please, that I was not personally familiar with Ernest, but of all, that is, I always said it, in my opinion, Ernest should have been the next after John Brezenko as a legend, and how he fought against Gino Shvili once again proves it.
SPEAKER_00: I want to thank him again for this. I want to thank you, Pasha, for just perfect work, so to speak. And with Ernest, it's as if I look in the mirror. Absolutely the same thinking, the same answers.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he said that very impressed, very impressed with Hermes, how he did with Levan. He said that Hermes can be next best after John Brzenk, after that. And yeah, he said that he doesn't know him personally. They never met personally, but he said, I'm looking like in the mirror right now and we are thinking the same. We are pulling alike and yeah, we are like,
SPEAKER_01: Is it? Yeah. And are you going to also learn how to pull like this? Now I started. Really? Really? Came on you. With pronator. Pronator without the hand. No, but knocking move. Knocking move. Every time back pressure. From now on, you are on my list. I'm joking. I'm joking. With pronator. Without the hand.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You are trying to copy Devon, huh? Yeah, that is very good technique this. Yeah. Because if you keep too much the hand, you lost the hand and you lose quickly. But if you without the hand with pronator, you have more chance to open. Yeah. Are you going to pull this way against Devon? With Devon? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: with them no no it's easy only these on on the only there is yes ah okay yeah okay i understand no problem yeah okay once again thank you guys thank you paulo very much for your opinions for your translation you are always great edition and i hope to see you in istanbul as well
SPEAKER_01: Arsene, thank you very much. And I hope to see you in Istanbul. I want to see you in Istanbul. I've already made the agreement with your manager while I'm doing this. He's right by me. And Ernest, thank you very much, my friend. And see you in July. Yeah, for sure. Thank you. Bye, guys. Take care. Bye-bye.
