Speaker: Thank you.
SPEAKER_04: Hello, Hermes, you hear me? My video is not... You see? Yeah, something is wrong with you. Why is that happening? Maybe you get out and enter again? I'm trying again. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Why is that happening? Okay, now it's good. Yeah. No. So, how are you, Hermes? I don't understand why there are these problems.
SPEAKER_00: This happens usually when someone has too much power. Too much power, my friend? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They are affecting all the... Yeah, this is why it's happening. Because before your match in Dubai, this wasn't happening. No. Now a new level, my friend. Another level. Yeah, a new level. That's why it's happening. Now it's okay.
SPEAKER_03: I hope so. I hope so. So, how are you? How is your shoulder? How is everything? I feel something in my biceps. I don't recover very well. Yeah, no worries. You handle so much power. This pull like this is very hard to cover. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because I never pulled like this and you know, your body is not ready for this. Yeah, you're right. You don't have that kind of memory in your muscles. Yeah. But you did pull very well, you know, you did pull very well. Before the match, you said that you're going to go there like crazy.
SPEAKER_03: And then you did that, yeah. I think, but I'm super happy after this fight. But maybe if I was more calm in some position, maybe I can do more. Do you think that this happened, you stopped him at round three,
SPEAKER_00: Do you think that it was also because before round three, you didn't think that maybe you should continue fighting like this? Or is it that, to me, do you know how it looked? It looked like, you know, I told you privately as well, on round three, when Levan was trying to hold on you, trying to pin you, you know, like without the strap and his hand, his hand, like, I think it was one of his biggest mistakes to,
SPEAKER_00: spend energy there because your arm was so strong he thought that he could control but i mean i was very impressed with your arm arm power like seriously you were saying before the before the match you were saying my wrist is iron impossible impossible when you were saying this when you were saying that inside of me i was saying uh hermes maybe not you know
SPEAKER_00: but of course i cannot tell you the negative way but i was thinking that your wrist would go but like your arm from here there is a possibility but if he would go straight side pressure i knew that your arm is very strong so that one pull right direction you know to go out yeah if you put your arm he would be stuck somewhere here your arm would control uh maybe
SPEAKER_03: Maybe because in the third round I pulled more with the back, you understand? Same last time when I pulled with Cefi and other guys like this. The third match I pulled more with my back. Your legs? Yeah, if you see the match.
SPEAKER_03: with a very good attention in the third part is a little different. But I don't know in the third match when he stopped me and he wanted to pull without the straps.
SPEAKER_00: finish the match side of me there are more confident to yeah yeah fight after his hand a little bit get tired you know during trying to control a little bit like pumped because i think the problem not because he couldn't take he takes your hand but he couldn't control your pronated you know so he was just only over pronated but your arm he couldn't go to your arm every time
SPEAKER_00: he tried to go your arm you were just stopping you know so here you were incredibly strong but here you said that later you told me that his hand was so big hard to control very difficult it's very difficult because believe me my my wrist i think only leva can take my wrist yeah
SPEAKER_00: only there because i feel my wrist uh amazing strong yeah yeah but but i was thinking that he would take because i saw even when you pull with uh the cheffy your wrist was like totally like flat you understand and i was thinking of course chef is incredibly strong if cheffy plated your wrist i was thinking that lebanon would do a little bit more because he's
SPEAKER_03: Maybe stronger also. I think the problem is now with him because he's stronger than me in the back pressure. If I had more power in the back pressure, maybe I would have stopped the match. Not in this position, but maybe.
SPEAKER_00: little more in the middle. I think not only back pressure, my friend, you both have incredible back pressure, but his wrist. Yeah, yeah. If you had his wrist and he had yours, then I think you would take his hand even with your arm. I think the difference, not so much about the arm, but here, I think it's difficult to take his hand because
SPEAKER_03: uh it's too much because it is too the fingers long like this and they over my hands like this yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. You know, as a super top roller, you know, I mean, your performance was good, but when you look at idealistically, that is not the way that you like to pull, right? That you like to have. You didn't like it, right? You didn't like it. The important is to win, my friend. Yes, yes, yes, yes. And yeah, it's not my best way to win.
SPEAKER_03: but i'm happy because you know every time you learn when you fight every time you learn something more something more and now i learn i learned that this position but i'm glad that people were thinking about you only as a super top roller but you also showed everyone that your arm your horsepower is also
SPEAKER_00: very high level you know that that's good but but uh do you still think that the top of us were smart people the problem it was maybe because before the match
SPEAKER_03: I never expected to hold Levan with my arm completely open and without my wrist. I never imagined like that. Me neither. If somebody told me, I would say you are crazy. I would say crazy. Yeah, yeah. And you know, if maybe I learn before the fight more this technique, maybe
SPEAKER_03: maybe when the both the endurance is completely out maybe if I put immediately the shoulder like Jerry you know maybe there are more possibilities yeah but do you realize that people people are thinking that you stopping with your dead
SPEAKER_00: shoulder pressure it's not they probably a lot of people are missing that you started to match with incredible back pressure incredible left back pressure back pressure and then once you stop here
SPEAKER_00: you stop with the pressure to this way you didn't stop him right directly you stop in fact you stop his hands you didn't take his hand but he his hand even in trouble he couldn't control control here if he would control here you realize that round one round two
SPEAKER_00: he again took your hand he still couldn't go he come back up a little bit more curve and go down yeah but but whenever the time that he couldn't pin you he didn't have this control because your arm was you know like you lost the wrist but your pronator was still holding on you stop him stop him stop him and then you brought it yeah if you would like this he would yeah last year i i i lost
SPEAKER_03: the third round yeah when he flash pinned me immediately because i tried to change my technique directly this one yeah i i thought about now i maybe i go immediately in this position and i hold him like this but yeah because because you you immediately go there and then you gave him opportunity to use his
SPEAKER_03: wrist you know yeah yeah yeah but again and after this yes that's how you stop him go ahead my way is every time back pressure and after if you can stop you can go another way but uh if i i start with the shoulder press
SPEAKER_00: No way. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I saw that your constant back pressure, in my opinion, tired his wrist. He was holding, but he didn't have this control because before the goal, you incredibly back pressure, you were applying incredibly. So you were losing the hand, but the arm, like,
SPEAKER_03: still resisting here you know so i mean it was incredible and i pronated a little bit you know when you want to push it down with this and uh with this maximum power is is normally your hand is pumping your fingers like this holding like not like this but he was just like hardly hardly holding like this yeah
SPEAKER_00: And you were probably pulling the strap this way. Yeah, it was incredible. I mean, Levan is the king. He's the best. But you just showed that he is a human and that's possible to beat him. And like whenever I was watching, I saw the message came from Travis. He said that the arm wrestling, he said that Hermes gave arm wrestling world a big favor. It means that Hermes made Levan look
SPEAKER_00: human still super human but still human yeah yeah now now other athletes have a more confidence there are more excited to to to try to take the first position yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah before before we were saying here is levan and then second third and everyone is here now levan is here
SPEAKER_00: You are here and then people are around here. You bring this here up here all together. But let's see how many people can pose the same problem because after this match, I don't think you are the only one who learned something. I think Levan also learned something because when you look like when you are unchallenged, you know, and then you, I mean, you think that everything is perfect because there's no challenge. Somebody needs to find
SPEAKER_00: a weakness with you there so you're like oh okay this point is not as good as i was thinking so what i'm just saying the one is also will come maybe not more power but more more technical more endurance another female and i'm very um i never spent 11 in the the start region is
SPEAKER_03: very fast. It's incredible. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. It was incredible. It was incredible. And the third match, many people think about, I made a video about this. You know, when I continue to go
SPEAKER_03: out of the pad when I pushed. But it was because I was in the limit of the pad and when I pushed it for going this way, the elbow continued to go out. Understand? Also, you had a foul there? My elbow was in the limit and when I pushed it,
SPEAKER_03: and then he he continued to try to pull yeah yeah yeah right and when they push it they may be able to go go out so you your elbow get out you get foul there
SPEAKER_03: No, I don't want to make a foul to Lewa. No, no, no. Did your elbow get out? Did he get a foul? Yeah, he continued to go out because it wasn't the limit. And when I press with the pressure here, because he continued to go out. Because he pulled it here and the pressure here. Yeah. So we saw that.
SPEAKER_00: mean you you can do this kind of press but we already knew you are used to that kind of pressure but usually you use that kind of pressure after top rolling the guy you know you go and then you you press there yeah so but that pressure once you top roll someone and put the shoulder is also incredible but this time you you also use it in in a defensive way you know against the top roller not against someone that you know who tried to
SPEAKER_03: i'm very happy because you know sometimes when you push because if you're sure there is the line there are no problem of the armies in this position there are no problem but if you push like this sometime here you click
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you have that kind of thing? Did you feel? No, no, no, no, no. I was very lucky because the left, five years ago, there are this problem. And it's very long, this inflammation to recover. But the right hand, I don't have now.
SPEAKER_00: right now you have some issue with the shoulder and some so it's a very big problem but maybe your bicep is inflammation a little bit here yeah yeah yeah you'll be careful with that one huh make sure that you know the inflammation is gone before you continue pulling you know pushing yourself your limits yeah wow that was incredible like you know there is there are some times that you know you
SPEAKER_00: in the life you see something unexpected and then you don't see no for for me you know you just you to do this was unexpected to
SPEAKER_00: hundred percent of the community you know this this before the match if somebody would say that if somebody told me this i would just say i understand you are a new guy you know to the community yeah but you know whenever i watch like at that moment everything became like so flu you know just like like
SPEAKER_00: like you know on the movies you see like a moment comes you know everything is like slow motion like you know that life stopped that moment and i was like is this real you know yeah yeah it's real you know that's happening you know i was like like like you know that's really happening come on come on yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's incredible yeah
SPEAKER_00: Maybe God gave me this power because... Yeah, and also I will also tell you, I also told you privately, many people disrespected Levan. I also disagree with that one. Levan is a great champion. And if people right now are telling you all these positive words, it is because
SPEAKER_00: Levan is a so great, powerful athlete that you gave him this kind of problem. If this match would happen against someone else, it still would be great. But this is so great what you did because you did to someone like Levan. And so I think that there is no need to just like push someone down just to bring someone up. You know, Levan is great. You are also great. Yeah. I mean, it was incredible. I respect both of you and no need to create a bad guy.
SPEAKER_03: But again, you deserve those two rounds, 100%, for sure, you know. Yeah, because I will... I show many videos about this and many things, but maybe next time I want to clear more the rules, the running foul, like this, because it was not very...
SPEAKER_03: clear understand yeah i think i think that if you guys pay more attention before the match then i mean but before the match you are like you know so strong you're like let's pull yeah but for me i see the many times is super victor for myself for my yes it is better to win but it is already uh amazing for me
SPEAKER_03: Yes. And I respect Lewand. I have a big respect to Lewand. He's a very good guy, very professional guy. And yeah, there are some moments that are, you know, sometimes there are the moments. There is one guy, he's saying that.
SPEAKER_00: levon using the king's move against hermes was clear statement regarding the single hermes i mean my friends i i don't really know but um what leon did is not a king's movie he's just we need to understand these people because they also said the same thing to george when he was pulling you know against jerry like this and whenever they are saying that hey listen his shoulder is below
SPEAKER_00: probably they don't know that this in a neutral and losing position and yeah is they don't understand the difference i think we need to make a video to explain that you know this is not that that normal yeah yeah this is not this is not that this is when you are losing that you use it here humerus is that you know bone that that is the difference like i can show them that
SPEAKER_00: easily 50 of the top rollers when they are winning their shoulder goes down it's it's yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so you made the video and you said you're gonna uh hurt and crash shoulder elbow everything in jelly
SPEAKER_03: You will see, my friend. I will see. It's better to call... I said it many times. With Jari, it's better to call an ambulance. You know, near the hotel. Because maybe... Maybe we need... You think that... He needs an ambulance. Oh, okay. Let's see what he will say. Let's see what he will say, but... I don't know. I wouldn't underestimate him.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry, but for Jerry, this is a very bad fight. No way. If I take his wrist, yeah, he's super number one shoulder press in the world. If I take some wrist, there are no way for him. So you are saying that
SPEAKER_00: not only the center even you take his wrist you can still win i go down easy like this maybe i go in the side pressure the little hook or here we see oh okay okay so you are in your mind after after this le one match no no after level i i i thought before the level even even before yeah yeah so
SPEAKER_00: we see to try some techniques but i have a question for you who do you think is the strongest arm master in north america dave chaffee dave chaffee dave chaffee would beat devon everyone yeah everyone gary and devon
SPEAKER_03: Maybe now I want to see Devon with Gennady. He's very interesting because Devon is amazing. Now I saw his fight and he's in very incredible shape. I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: I show in this video with the sandries, with the mask, there are more quality than when he pulled it with Leiva. Yeah, and here against... It's only my opinion. I think he's more stronger than what they... So you are saying that if Devon would pull against Dave Chaffee,
SPEAKER_03: If the pads are normal pads, do you think that... Normal pads without W.R. LaRouche, without King Moog. Oh, okay. The pressure of... Strong, right? Strong, huh? And I said in one video, the power of Lehmann is more than us. But...
SPEAKER_03: I say the only side pressure, only this. Yeah. This. I think the best in the world is Dave. Okay. Because with Lema, yes. I felt here and I stopped with the brachial. You felt more back pressure. Yeah. But with the side pressure, you felt more with Dave Sheffy.
SPEAKER_03: If Levan, he was this side pressure and with back pressure, his back pressure with side pressure like Dave, he beat me easy, very easy. Oh, okay. So you are saying that if Dave Sheffield would have the hand and wrist of Levan, he would be like this, huh, everyone?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think... Now I want to speak only side because it's very difficult to... Yes. But the side felt a little more Dave. I understand, yeah. My friend Dave, he won with...
SPEAKER_00: He won with Denis Tiplenko in his prime. Yeah, I understand. Only side. Yeah. There is a question. Religion students. Hermes, Devon would still crush your pizza. Is this? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you are saying that
SPEAKER_00: You are saying that Dave Sheffield is the number one North American? I'm too curious to say Dave with Devon. Devon always says that he will kill Dave. I don't know what Dave says about it. If you show the last match between them,
SPEAKER_00: If Devon doesn't pull with a king move, he lost the match. Yeah, I saw, I saw. But don't you think that Devon today is also... Yeah, yeah, now he's more and more stronger. Yeah, I mean, more connected, more healthy. Yeah, more healthy. The power is a very big difference. At that time, at that time, yeah, I understand.
SPEAKER_03: so you are saying that Devon is better but still wouldn't be possible to stop him you know and you are saying he would yeah maybe he can't stop a little bit he's reached Devon if he wait wait maybe with the endurance his crew very good match yeah and the first and maybe second match will win Dave yeah but to win
SPEAKER_00: two first two rounds, it doesn't make you North American king. So you are saying he cannot win three? You are saying he cannot win three? Or possibly he can win also? Because Devon is incredible, he's an endurance. Endurance, okay. So what you are saying is that Devon versus Dave would be an incredible match? To be clear, the number one guy in North America. And what does Jerry say about this?
SPEAKER_00: Jerry... You may be underestimating Jerry. If he beats you in July... If he beats you in July... Not possible, you think? Beat me? Yeah. Are you serious, my friend? No. I mean... If he beats... I don't know. I'm not saying he's going to beat you. You're going to win, but you are so serious. I hope... I hope he...
SPEAKER_03: He don't make... Now, yes, I make the problem in my shoulder. But I hope he will compete with me. Oh, you are saying that he may find an excuse and not come? I don't know. No, this is what you mean? Maybe. Maybe when the match...
SPEAKER_03: It will be close, the date of the match. No. We will see. We will see. We will see. The 22 July, I'm sure I will be in Istanbul. Yeah, maybe. Maybe a little bit later than 22. We will talk later. Maybe. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Not so much, but around that time we will talk about it. At the end of July or less. Whatever, we will talk, but maybe not July 22, but we will see. We will see how it will be. Anyway, so let's talk about East versus West 7. And you realize that when, for sure, Devon is the most popular arm master on this earth. Most popular.
SPEAKER_00: And when people are pulling against him, people are extra motivated to prove something. Yeah. So again, the shoulders, everything will be bigger. He will be bigger, but Devon also will be bigger. And now people always talk that Devon Eastern Europeans beat you. They kill you. And then he beats.
SPEAKER_00: Rudnick and Sandris but now people say that oh okay yes you're right you are the king of the heavyweight but people says super heavyweight is the different story they say and now if he beats Gennady with right arm that will be the first eastern european super heavyweight that Devon beats if he can beat him how do you see how do you see this match
SPEAKER_03: Davon is very smart and he knows who is better for him to compete. Because I'm sure if he wants to compete with Gennady, the first with Gennady, because he knows Gennady, the wrist of Gennady is not very strong.
SPEAKER_03: And I think he will take his wrist, not too much. Gennady has a lot of pressure here, the side pressure. But, you know, maybe there are same like when he fought with Prutnik.
SPEAKER_03: But there is no way Gennady to go outside, right? You think that's how you're thinking? I root a lot for Gennady, who is a very big friend for me. Yeah, they want to, but...
SPEAKER_00: I think a little favorite is Devon. Do you think that there is any possibility Gennady to have better endurance than Devon? Or impossible? I think it's impossible. Because when Gennady fought with me, I don't know. Yeah, but Gennady is after three, four years. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But the endurance, my friend, the endurance is genetic.
SPEAKER_00: no no get no no no no you don't have the endurance is genetic but to reach your genetic limits you need to train i mean you don't just sit at home and they have the best no no no yeah but if you remember if you compare the devon and the in the gennady the genetic devon is here
SPEAKER_03: Okay, this is what you're saying. Maybe Gennady, he trains a lot, he's an endurer, but it's difficult for him to go. Okay. Because he also has a very good genetics. It's a very good fight. This is very incredible because there are very good shows for us, for everybody.
SPEAKER_00: And also, Gennady is also crazy. You will see. Yeah. You know it's crazy. You know it's crazy. You know it's crazy. You know it's crazy. You know it's crazy. You know it's crazy. You know it's crazy. You know it's crazy. You know it's crazy. You know it's crazy. You know it's crazy. You know it's crazy. You know it's crazy. You know it's crazy.
SPEAKER_03: I shake only the hand of the Danes. But if you are a little smart, do you think... Before the match, would you vote? Before the match with Leiva, if I'm stupid, yes. Yes. Sure. If I'm stupid. I don't know. I mean, some people...
SPEAKER_03: yeah i mean some people need some subject you know yeah and after this now the people compare my left lost with moroso and they compare with my right there are minimum minimum 30 percent difference the minimum yes but
SPEAKER_00: It's normal, there are many opinions. I understand. So you are saying that you are giving the edge to Devon against Gennady. For sure, it's a very big war, big fight, big emotions, incredible fight. I can't wait to see this match. Good question.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think that Gennady will be able to fight till the end? Or you think that somehow he will experience the same thing Rudnick and Sandri's experience?
SPEAKER_00: Do you think maybe the endurance of Gennady will go out and... No, no, I'm not thinking. I'm not thinking. I'm asking. Do you think that Gennady will have... You are thinking that Devon is going to win, but do you think that Gennady will also, at some point, his power will totally finish? Or Devon will be like, hardly beat him, you know? Or do you think that Devon will be able to quit Gennady? Depends.
SPEAKER_03: If Devon can hold Gennady and he wait, wait, wait. Depends of who. But I suggest to Devon he don't try like this to hold Gennady. Because Gennady he can pull in many different styles.
SPEAKER_00: I'm very curious because both of them have incredible endurance. I know Gennady lost to Jerry, but he chose the wrong way to pull him. And Devon also told me that he also wouldn't pull that way against Jerry. He said, no way. Yeah, he needs to do that. And then he thinks that he's going to win that way, but not that way. Anyone
SPEAKER_00: From North America, when you talk about top rolling cherry, they are saying it's a big mistake, they are saying. I know, I know what you are thinking. You are saying that not for you, I understand. I can see from your face that you are saying, yeah, you are saying that like it is, yeah. You are saying that that is something
SPEAKER_03: If Gheorghi can use the press, he won't 3-0. Sure. You need to show the match. If he goes up with his body and puts his shoulder in position to the press, the match is already finished. Yes, sometimes it looks that way, but we also thought the same when Lewand
SPEAKER_00: to get up whenever Levan get up his arm you know that that sometimes maybe Levan is not too able to to do this for this press yeah yeah but but Jerry says that Jerry said that he was super healthy but he said that he didn't have after his shoulder injury he rested he says this and he said that his shoulder was healthy but he couldn't
SPEAKER_03: train as much as he wanted. This is what he says. We cannot take anything away from Gheorghi. Gheorghi pulled incredibly. The match was wow. I don't know. Jerry said many, many things. It's time to close his mouth.
SPEAKER_00: You will close his mouth? Completely close. You will see after this match, he will finish this drama. The guy says you rage at the Rodak. Jake also arm wrestling said you pull Dennis and he said both were
SPEAKER_00: closed i don't know what he means but yeah he said that jack also our master said that to this guy or i don't know to whom i didn't hear he said that you and dennis seriously this is what the guy says anyway so you want to hear my opinion jerry will destroy you no i know your opinion
SPEAKER_03: he will be like this ready go boom and then yeah i'm very curious i i i don't want uh underestimating underestimate
SPEAKER_03: nobody because it's very big mistake if you underestimate this level if you go and you underestimate someone it's very big mistake because a lot of chance you will lose and I I prefer to pull in July because I want to be ready 100%
SPEAKER_03: That method will hurt you. Because there are possibilities. It's not sure. So you are saying that... Nothing is sure 100%. Yeah, you are saying that... Yeah, you're stronger than me, finished. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But my mind is clean because I know I'm worrying 100%
SPEAKER_03: my best shape and because if you lose and you know you underestimated your opponent or you can put your maximum power it's very difficult to yeah somebody is asking if I was serious about this the jury is gonna do to you and no my friend I wasn't serious and I'm organizer I cannot have
SPEAKER_00: I cannot express my opinion in either way. I can say how the match can go, but I cannot say this guy is going to win or that guy is going to win. But I like to tease Hermes a lot. I like to tell him that, you know, Dave Sheffield is going to crush you. I always say it because we are friends. He doesn't get offended whenever I was just...
SPEAKER_00: Engin, what was the first thing you said to Ermes after his fight against Levan? I don't remember. I wrote him a message, but I need to go and check. Dizzy does. Ermes, thank you for giving an incredible performance. One of the best matches I have ever witnessed. Thank you, Engin, for all you do. You are a legend. Thank you, my friend. Thank you for your support. Yeah. Thank you, guys.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, my friend, now your event is every time better, better, the quality, everything is incredible. It's our event, our event, all together. Yeah, yeah. All together. We are just trying to bring our messaging to the next point, you know, all together.
SPEAKER_00: I don't see any of these guys, these fans, as customers. I don't see myself as a businessman. I don't see it. I see like we are athletes, organizers, and the fans all together. We are bringing arm wrestling together to the next level. Yeah, but everyone, believe me, everyone supports you about this because you...
SPEAKER_03: You do a lot for this sport. We do it all together. Just forget it. But if there is someone to create this event... We are athletes. We have a fight.
SPEAKER_03: to do a big show for the sport. But it's very important for someone to create this event, to grow up in the sport. It's very, super important. Without you or another guy to do like this... And how about without you? How about without Devon? How about without John? It's the same thing. How about without
SPEAKER_03: these fans here, all together. I do my part, you do your part, these fans do their part, all together. Teamwork. I saw in Italy after my match, many people, many people now, there are fans of this sport. That's good, super, super, yeah. In Italy, there are only football, but the social media, they look at this
SPEAKER_03: It was a super match on Saturday. Normally there are 200 people to compete. Now it was 500. There are a lot of beginners, new guys who want to compete.
SPEAKER_00: I always say, my friends, in the public level, arm wrestling is one of the most popular sports. Whatever school you go, everyone knows who is the best in the class, who is the second best, who is the strongest. Even the woman, even at home, arm wrestling with the son is the most popular. The only problem is we somehow couldn't bring this to do that.
SPEAKER_00: high level sports so that because once people see us wow there is a sport and this support is like a like a like very well organized and everything is good they are like okay okay you understand they belong in there you know i mean almost every human being
SPEAKER_00: is experiencing arm wrestling at some point of their early age you know yeah so now now we came to their level the other day i was just riding with john and then i told you right john john as soon as i read it and i was like i turned to hermes i was like hermes john told me something that you know i couldn't believe in my eyes and i almost told john stop you know stop it's too much
SPEAKER_00: the guy said very positive things and i was like wow to hear from him you understand it was incredible he said that you know like positive things you know not like like but yeah i was very happy happy and then the same i i talked with devon live we were just normal chats and he is like
SPEAKER_00: he was just said mother was sitting there and he said mother this is the guy that i was telling you about and and i was like what did you tell your mother you said negative things right he said okay let her take and she said oh you are the guy that is going to bring to the armless into the next level i was like very happy yeah yeah everybody told me like this that's good that's everybody yeah anyway so let's talk about east versus west seven more
SPEAKER_00: my friend um so you are saying devon is slightly favored about the power maybe a little bit stronger but not enough to dominate probably no no no yeah and then then when it is endurance you are saying that devon has had with the endurance yeah a little bit can you imagine can you imagine gennady on that stage
SPEAKER_00: You realize that this is the lifetime, the biggest match of Gennady. He pulled other guys. He pulled Lewand and many guys. He's going to come there huge, huge.
SPEAKER_03: many times he want to compete with the devil yeah yeah yeah yes maybe they started to do he want to compete with them but but the moment to fight can i ask you something ermus do you think that it is almost every arm masters nightmare to pull devon and being stopped
SPEAKER_00: by him what do you think that it is almost every top like heavyweight and super heavyweight nightmare you know nightmare that pulling with devon and then you go and then he stops you that that that's terrible
SPEAKER_03: He will destroy your mind. He will destroy your career. Your mind, your arm and everything. Yeah, you really need to... I never saw nothing about Brudnick. Where is Brudnick? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's why I'm thinking. Imagine he stops and looks at your face like that. And then fight me, fight me. Maybe...
SPEAKER_00: if he take me like this uh i can make many fouls to stop immediately and finish and then start again right yeah yeah it's better like this i mean the bad part is that somebody may lose but the guys the guy doesn't only beat you the guy takes your soul everything you just he just like starts talking with you and then he makes you quit you know just
SPEAKER_00: I don't think in the night you can sleep very well. I'm telling you, not only the night, if you pull against him like that, that experience, you will never forget until you die. I mean, if you lose, you will always remember that.
SPEAKER_00: until until you you train better and beat him you know yeah that's that's terrible you know yeah anyways so okay let's go to the next one laletin with left arm with tobias people people underestimate tobias but do you remember that when when morozov tried to topple tobias and you know his wrist people says
SPEAKER_00: Morozov progressed a lot, but Tobias also is young, you understand? And I have, you know, this kind of style of that I don't know. It's not very efficient to compare high top roller with low top roller. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So, and you know that Tobias has strong hands, so this match may go... I mean, people think that it's... I think 50-50. Me too, me too. 50-50. Yeah, I think stylistically, Tobias. Stylistically, Tobias. Yes, but maybe... Maybe Nalep is too strong. Maybe. Yeah. But I think it will go like this. You know, Toprol is this.
SPEAKER_00: You think they will be like this? Yeah, maybe like this, but maybe he has more power here and he can hold. We'll see. Do you think that as a top roller with left arm, if you would pull Tobias, you would be very confident? No, no, no. No, right? It's not that easy to top roll the guy with left arm.
SPEAKER_03: I'm not very happy about my last match with the left arm. I don't want to make excuses. But after the match with Chaffee, I remember my legs shaking. I got too much power out.
SPEAKER_03: I drink a lot of Coca-Cola, sugar for recovery. But maybe fresh to fresh with Moroso, I can do more. More. But maybe he would still have better endurance, but you would do more than that. Yes, better. Okay, so you are saying that match is 50-50.
SPEAKER_00: So how about Ungarbev versus Irakli? Incredible fight. Good match. I think Irakli has more horsepower, but I think Ungarbev has more control. More control. Yeah. Maybe Irakli can win like when he fought with John. Yeah. Do you think that it is possible to beat?
SPEAKER_00: He is very smart, very speedy. He can use press. Incredible fight. 50-50. Ongarbev really surprised me against Michael. It is not because of winning or losing, but he countered everything that Michael did most of the time.
SPEAKER_00: And Ongarbev never pulls someone like Michael. Michael is a very difficult opponent, you know. And Ongarbev, to counter like every move that Michael did, just showed that Ongarbev has very high table IQ level. I think very high table IQ level, yeah. Because how can you not, like, you'd never experience someone like Michael, and you go to the table and pull him technically,
SPEAKER_03: I think this smart to pull in the table, what is the word? Table IQ. Yeah, table IQ. Your table IQ is also very high. If you're born with this, because it's difficult to learn some positions,
SPEAKER_03: when you fight. It's difficult to be ready in a different position. It's difficult to explain, but like me, when I fought with Levan and with the shoulder press with Tornado, it's like a talent for the pull.
SPEAKER_03: You have something inside to... You know, if you're born with this, you can. Of course, I will tell you something. Because there are many people who have one technique, he pulls, and he loses. And the second match, he loses, same. That match, he loses, same. Fourth match, he loses, same.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, sometimes if you are not strong enough, whatever you do, you're going to lose. But yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I mean, Devon is one of the most versatile pullers, but against Levan, whatever he tried, it didn't work, you know. But maybe if he don't get injured, maybe he can do a little more. But just imagine that, you know, he got injured.
SPEAKER_00: while he was overpowered you know that's why yeah i mean but what i'm just saying that compared to round one leon is the one who made an adjustment because first match he went like this he was like hardly in the second match he was more like sideway you know on the round two so that one was the the one that you know who made the adjustment compared to round one you know yeah yeah yeah sure sure
SPEAKER_00: yeah i mean i'm telling you my friend most of the most of the elite athletes have my opinion have very high level iq in the physical combat sports i mean i mean they that especially in arm wrestling like whenever i watch michael versus ongar bear match how they play chess game there to me they play chess game you know who's gonna make the mistake you know yeah yeah it was incredible like people people
SPEAKER_00: talks bad about michael but beating michael is not something that many can do like like i sure now is uh vice the bicep injury he had yeah but they removed the bone i don't exactly know what happened but where is already here and i hope he's gonna be uh fine very soon so so you are saying that you are saying that
SPEAKER_00: hongar way miraculously 50 50 tobias la latin is 50 50 and devon kennedy 51 49 super i'm incredible fight not this guy this guy is incredible yeah thank you thank you my friend thank you yeah and meet the match love the content engine thank you hermes you are the baby goat my friend forza
SPEAKER_00: italia i mean it is it is beautiful feeling that you know everyone like it is there is nothing to blame everyone of course this is like you belong to that nation and then you represent your nation and people from your country proud of you
SPEAKER_00: me it's a beautiful feeling you know yeah yeah i mean i'm also proud of my country and i i love representing it but whenever i do this i understand how it is for you yeah yeah a lot a lot of measures many many measures i can't i can't too much yeah but now listen italians and many listen you had you had
SPEAKER_00: a lot of haters at the beginning. Not really, really beginning. At the beginning, not many people knew about you. After Matt Mask. People call you practice puller, practice champion. But if you remember at that time, I was saying that there are three guys that will be Irakli, I said, Mindaugas, and you, I said that these are my soon future, you know, top guys.
SPEAKER_00: But I mean, it was obvious to see that how beautiful corporal you have, how explosive, how that fire you have in you. I mean, the biggest thing is that to have that fire in you, because you have the fire, the fire is gonna push you more to be more successful, because I know what it is. Ask your father, he probably knows what kind of fire I had when I was young as well. So I know that feeling. So today, look at where you are.
SPEAKER_00: And now I can tell you easily 95% of the community, they are behind you. They are like Raul Hermes. Everyone tells you. It doesn't mean that every match they are going to support you. They are Devon fans. They are going to support Devon. But everyone, you gain the respect. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Georgians, Georgians, the video,
SPEAKER_03: Roman, mate. Roman, you know, from Georgia. Yeah. Yeah. And you gained the respect of the majority. It's very beautiful because, you know, you believe in yourself and you feel something good, but you can prove
SPEAKER_03: after is difficult to you need to prove something yes for this because you can believe in yourself you know you can go in this level because i believe i believe i know when i don't know when my belief maybe next year maybe after two i i can go in the first position my friend my friend
SPEAKER_00: i'm telling you i i told this before that today's superhero ways are that the unluckiest one in the history because they live in a time that there is someone like leon exists imagine if that one didn't exist right now you would be probably you know yeah but yeah yeah but again to me you fulfill 85 percent of your final dream 85 percent now not only
SPEAKER_03: one year and a half i am in the in the super heavyweight yeah yes yes and uh if you compare me when i was with kurdeca there are 40 percent difference meaning power from that time to this time you you improved yeah yeah and i think i think i can grow up many more more more
SPEAKER_03: I think next year I have another 15% more like it is. But again, you know, don't push yourself too much before the right time because after a point you may have some injury or something. No, no, no. For me, you have two things. There are the time. Everything, there are need the time to... Yeah, yeah, I agree. Two things you need to... If you work too speed, yeah, maybe you can.
SPEAKER_00: But it's better to wait, to grow, something, something, something. And it's the better way. Two things, in my opinion, you need to prove. One is you need to become superweight champion. And the second thing, you need to do this long time. Like, you don't need to always stay the champion. But if you stay champion around
SPEAKER_00: being a champion, you know, sometimes there will be bad times as well. It's life, you know, but even if you can, if you can do this until you are 40 minimum, then for sure, you will be among one of the greatest ever, because for me, it needs to be not like one time performance, two years performance. It needs to be a little bit period. Yeah. Okay. Another question, Sasha, Andrew, what do you think about Pauline?
SPEAKER_03: Pauline is a very good guy and very super powerful. Yes, it's normal when I fought with Dave, he looked for Dave, but it's normal. But I think when he pulled it with Rustam,
SPEAKER_00: I think Rustan is more stronger than Power. But first two rounds, Paul tried to more go outside. I don't know, but... He went inside. Listen, he tried to topple Rambet. He lost. And then three rounds in a row, he hooked and beat Rambet. Easy. He hooked and beat Rambet. And whenever he tried to topple John, he just hit and John controlled and beat him easy.
SPEAKER_00: whenever he tried to hook john he was or john's forearm got injured you know you remember it was all red colored yeah yeah and i asked john like did you allow to hook you he said no paul hooked me and he said and so paul is very explosive i don't know why he always tries outside and most of the time he is not successful and then he goes inside and then and then there he is successful
SPEAKER_00: And I'm not saying that he was stronger than Rustam. Rustam was stronger. Rustam got injured. It was the round three, but that was an effective move. Trust me. Watch again. It was a very effective hit. And so what do you think about him and Sarcho? Sarcho, the last time when he competed, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he competed many times in the World Championship and he won like a fight with a beginner. He won very easily. And he has a lot of endurance and a lot of power. He won with Irakli too. Yeah, it was my event. It was my event, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But incredible fight too. This is another incredible fight. Who is the favorite? Don't be political, just say how you feel. If I put my money, I put on Sasho.
SPEAKER_00: Sasho was very dominant with hookers. Sasho is more dominant against top-rollers. I haven't seen a top-roller beat him, but the guys who beat him were Zolaev inside, Ozan Kocak inside, Spartak
SPEAKER_00: You know, just it is almost impossible. More than a couple, you try a couple, he puts a grenade and he hits you. He's very strong in the hook. Whenever he loses, I see he's losing inside. Nah, I don't remember very well. Yeah, okay, okay. But it's very interesting to this match a lot.
SPEAKER_03: This is what I love for many years. Western guys pull here, Western guys pull here. In two years, there are many more beautiful matches than 20 years ago. Do you know what? There are many beautiful matches in these two years.
SPEAKER_00: 10 20 years ago my friend in seven events i organized around 100 world level super masters 100 yeah do you know how long time like seven events only seven events yeah yeah yeah yeah well anyway so incredible incredible fight israel also how about alijan they wanted to tell uh to the guy
SPEAKER_03: For the guys, they don't pay some pay-per-view. They work maybe many hours to bring some links, some videos, but they don't understand if they continue like this, it's impossible to create another event like this. And the sport will go down, there are no matches, the sport is finished.
SPEAKER_03: and they don't after this they don't watch now yes my friend yes yes yes this is normal i i try to understand i try to explain this and my friend there are 14 15 dollars what is it 14 if you go out and you drink two free beers there are 20 dollars you can bring two two friends to eat some pizza or something together
SPEAKER_00: you can pay 14 the dollars and you can watch and you support the the yeah yeah yeah i'm telling you my friends i my my motivation is uh love all this sport and whenever i hear people says you know yeah you do great job or something that that that is motivation i love it but we need to do that all together you know all together yeah yeah they need to support us i understand some people
SPEAKER_00: more from eastern countries that may not have the same money but what i'm just saying that after some time we put on youtube officially because those people who are like streaming this my friend they are not spending anything they are not risking they are not investing anything yeah so they are only harming and they act like you know they are the savior of the sport how is it savior
SPEAKER_00: what you are doing may cause us to not to be able to organize anymore. And then are you gonna go and spend, invest and organize? No. So why are you doing this? Just don't. Whenever I say, Steve, I'm not telling this to the community who are watching or something, but those people who are streaming, you know, those people are bad people.
SPEAKER_00: But people who are watching, I know that it's not ethical, it's not right thing to do. It's harming, but I don't say anything bad. I don't call them name, anything, you know. But they need to understand that we need to sell paper route so we can pay to these athletes. These are our superstars, you know. This is not that, you know, Engin, you can never stop, you know, this. It's not for me, stopping or not stopping is not the thing. I want to just put the mentality in our community
SPEAKER_00: you can say that in in ufc they are doing it ufc like like almost billion dollar business you're talking about yeah but there are many sponsors for us for us we are we are just so small plant you know these kind of things are harming us we are not if i was as big as ufc even ufc is trying to stop these things but if i was as big as ufc i would have less concern
SPEAKER_00: because it wouldn't affect me to not organize anymore. But for our support, it can cause, to that point, don't you see after many years, we are, we made a bridge between fans and their dreams. You know, they say, Engin, we want to see this, we want, of course, I cannot do all of them. If I do all of them, I need to organize 100 matches every event, but I can't. But many of them, I am trying to make sure that, you know,
SPEAKER_03: these people thinking we what they think i'm not reading i'm reading the comments there are very important for us athletes to share the links for the pay-per-view because we took some sounds we took some for this if you don't share if you don't uh
SPEAKER_04: uh posted the event is difficult for the fans to to i will i i i have i have a small uh just one second um one second my friends just once again sorry i i apologize you um
SPEAKER_04: okay so anyway so another match you are saying this because um what's funny
SPEAKER_00: What are you talking about? Jerry, this guy is talking so much shit behind you, Jerry. It's unbelievable. Hey, he must have hurt his head when he went against Levan. Yeah, this is what I told him. He said that.
SPEAKER_01: You're gonna be afraid and find an excuse that you get injured and you are not gonna come in July. That's what he said. So in other words, what he said was exactly what he did. He said, oh, I hurt my vagina. Oh, I need my shoulder. I need to push it another. I learned from you, my friend. I learned from you. Yeah. I said I was learning from you. You've been hurt.
SPEAKER_00: against you even when i was hurt now there are one one okay okay you don't have any you don't have a match no no excuse anyone so anyone okay no more excuse you both spend it and do you know what he said jenny he said he said the king of the north america is either devon or dave sheffield i said jerry he left
SPEAKER_01: Oh, of course he's going to laugh. He's smoking that cheap Italian weed and drinking that shit Italian wine. My friend, we have the best wine in the world. What do you talk about? You drink some good wine. I like food. I'm not a wine drinker. I'll bring Kate. She'll drink the wine.
SPEAKER_03: I said, you're delusional, right? You're poor thing if you think that Dave and Devon are number one. Are you ever scared to pull with Devon? I don't know. I'm not scared. He just wants to beat you first. Devon, he said he come in your house to compete with you. Who said that? Devon.
SPEAKER_00: Hermes, would you accept if Devon just suddenly comes to your house? Would you accept to pull him, Hermes? I'm ready now. Oh, now you're ready for Devon, but you're not ready for me. Oh, yeah, I see. Vagina. What? I can't understand.
SPEAKER_01: You said you're ready if Devin showed up at your house to pull him, but you're not ready to pull me in two months. Oh, vagina. You are afraid of Jerry. You need to be careful what you say, Elvis. Jerry can't. Don't show up, Jerry. I don't want you to beat my ass. I got you. It's okay. I'll still buy you a drink after I beat you.
SPEAKER_00: you uh uh so you are ready to pull devon if he knocks your door now but you are not ready for jerry in two months with my shoulder heads in my friend but you said but you said that if devon comes right now you would pull him you said you are ready yeah but if i my shoulder is completely recovered yeah but but just jerry also was
SPEAKER_00: after the georgie now now he's a heavy now he's ready no no no but he wasn't trained whenever i asked him to pull against you he he said that he he didn't train and he said he wasn't even trained so good but he was healthy before gilgamesh is what he says i don't know and he he said that he just started training
SPEAKER_00: you know so he is not ready to listen this is not so good you know just going to somebody's home and directly pulling or something any of these matches should be when both guys says i'm ready this is the date and you and i these are the conditions that how it should be in my opinion you know that one is my good friend and i mean he is the best ambassador in the sport but i think that he shouldn't be like you know suddenly i come your home and let's pull you know
SPEAKER_01: That's my opinion. I agree. I agree. Yeah. I don't understand. It would be easy. Jalopy. What is Jalopy? Jalopy. It's a, when you go outside in your driveway, just look at what's sitting there. That's a Jalopy. Better car. Yeah. Shit box. Very bad car. Yeah. Old, old, poor running car that doesn't run. Jenny. I have a question for you. If.
SPEAKER_00: It is not the wild pet, the long wild pet, but the normal regular pet walk pet and Dave Chaffee and Devon who's who is there. If it's not, what's that? If it was not the long pad, if it's on a normal pad. Yeah. Normal pad. Yeah. Does it does. What do you think? I think Dave has the power to beat him. Even in six rounds match.
SPEAKER_01: can beat him for rounds you think i think it really just comes down to dave what shape he's in because we know stamina has been a concern of his right and uh i think that um dave has to make quick work of it because his gas tank runs out quicker than devin's best best of three dave wins easy best of five best of five is where it becomes a challenge
SPEAKER_00: And then best of seven, it goes to Devon. It means seven. Okay, so you are saying that best of three and then best of five and best of seven is what you are saying. Correct, yep. I understand. And how about you and Hermes? I told Hermes that Jerry is going to beat you like this, you will be like this, and he will be like this, and he's laughing. He's laughing? Yeah, he said he can beat you even with top roll, full top roll.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, good. Yeah, I'd like to see him try that. By the way, you look big, huh, Jerry? You look big. Oh, I know, and I feel bad for Hermes because, you know, I started training again. So he had a chance when it was going to be in May, but then he pushed it to July. Oh, my God, the poor thing. He's going to be crying come July. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look at that machine.
SPEAKER_01: did you see his last video jerry he said he's gonna destroy your shoulders he said he was gonna crush me in his last video i saw him you know so mental note it's okay you know i mean it's nice for people to have dreams but poor ermie's dream is going to be a dream until it happens and it becomes a nightmare what they say my friend
SPEAKER_03: What am I saying? I'm saying that it's okay to dream. You're supposed to. You're young. Yeah, you had a beautiful dream. And when I bring you in the reality, you see the reality. Yeah. You look like you're becoming a swimmer. Are you losing weight? I push your waist very slowly when I go depressed.
SPEAKER_03: Very, very slow. With this you can feel the losing position very, very good. Very slowly and maybe we can talk about drinking something after the match. When I push a little, very slowly. You will talk with him while you're beating him slowly? I put him on my shoulder and I can't wait.
SPEAKER_03: Whenever you want. Maybe you can give me one beer, and I drink the beer when I fight. No, we don't want alcohol at this stage. No? Coca-Cola is the same. He drinks grape juice. Yeah, he's too young to drink even...
SPEAKER_00: drinks with acid in it. Yeah, so he's a minor. He's just a minor. Yeah. Anyways, it will be very, very good. By the way, quickly, Jerry, I want to ask your predictions and then we can close. Devon versus Gennady? Gennady. You think Gennady is going to beat him? Yeah, 3-2. 3-2, in which way? You think he's going to go?
SPEAKER_00: I think Gennady wins the first match. I think Devin will win the second match. I think Gennady wins the third match. I think it goes right down to the last match. Wow, that's interesting what you are saying because it is like Devin to beat someone two rounds and that person to have endurance enough to beat him on the fifth round is not that easy, but you are saying that
SPEAKER_01: I agree. I just think that Gennady, have you seen his videos lately? He looks like he's getting big. He looks like he's getting strong. Yeah. I know that Devin is feeling good and looking good, but I think it's going to be a tough, tough match both ways. And Gennady has a quick attitude, so it's going to be tough. Yeah. Another thing I will ask you, Irakli versus Ongarwe, Jerry,
SPEAKER_00: In Iraq, he's coming in at what weight? Both 105 kilos, 231. I'm going to go, I'm going to buy a 3-1. And another question for Hermes. Dave Chaffee versus Rewas. Dave Chaffee. Like, how do you see that match? Maybe Rewas take the risk, but the power of Dave Chaffee is too strong.
SPEAKER_03: So you think he's going to dominate in three rounds? Not dominated, but I think now he has more endurance and he can finish the third match. So you are saying 3-0? Yeah, maximum 3-1. I understand. And Sherry, how do you see Dave Sheffield vs Revas?
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to go 3-1 as well. I'm going to say Dave wins the first two, Rivas wins the third one. Then Dave comes back and finishes on the fourth. Okay, so you're both in 3-1. And Hermes, Alijan versus Cody. These Kazakh guys, the name is Alijan Murado. Alijan Murado. Incredible, right? Left, left.
SPEAKER_00: He's impressive, this guy. Cody also has incredible left arm. Oh, 3-0 for... You think? Yeah. Do you remember the Kazakai Jerry? The pull against Petrenko in the same event that you pulled? You don't remember very much. And another question for you. Rob Vigent versus Durab Jerry.
SPEAKER_01: If Rob comes in trained, then I think Rob can do it because he's very technical. The question is, is he going to come in trained, right? I want him... I asked him to come train with me, too. And there's a lot of power from each other. Yeah. So if he comes in trained, then my money would be on Rob. If he's not trained, then my money's on Zareb because he's super strong. But Rob is a...
SPEAKER_03: He's a knowledgeable person. You just apply the training and strength with that knowledge. I understand. And Hermes, Arif versus Zerano? Arif. Arif? Because he is super fast in the top round and Zerano, I don't think he can hold. You don't think he can hook him, huh? No.
SPEAKER_01: possible. I understand. And Jerry, a question for you. Yeah. You, you, Hermes Gasparini versus Jerry Cadoret. Jerry wins 3-0. Well, Jerry's going to win 3-1 because one of those matches, I definitely want to screw around with them. As long as they don't get fouled out, right? But if it's pennant to win it, then it's going to be 3-1, Jerry wins.
SPEAKER_01: Jerry, a question for you. How confident are you beating Jerry, Ermes? Me? Yeah, how confident, you know? Very, very confident. You know, you have to be very confident. Whoever says they're not confident when they go into the match, don't take the match. But I feel super confident that Ermes thinks he knows how to stop me and Ermes thinks he's, you know,
SPEAKER_00: He's gone against someone like me, but he's never gone against someone like me. Okay, so he's only dreamy. He doesn't know because he never experienced... My friend, I'm smart. Top roller, smart. Too smart. Top roller? You can't... Yeah. Yeah, but the last match in Dubai also showed it's not bad against top... Yeah, another technique for the top roller.
SPEAKER_03: If you are smart, you can change everything, my friend. If I ask who? He said that if you are smart, you can top roll and you can change to switch to this technique as well. He says he is very smart. Oh, good. So why doesn't he be smart and go on a hook? Maybe I want to try to beat Jerry with his technique. Maybe I can win, but I don't know what happens.
SPEAKER_00: If I push... How about you hook him? I push and he push like this. I don't know what happened. I've never seen this match. Yeah. Silky will be thanked for your super chat, my friend. Hermes's power is too much for you, Jerry. He will pull you out of your shoulders and broke all of your bone and ligaments, my friend.
SPEAKER_00: Very smart, this guy, huh? People say that it's you that ride in secretly superchats like this. Yeah. Do you want to answer this guy, if Hermes can break your bones and ligaments, Jerry? Hermes can't even hurt my feelings, let alone hurt a bone. Nice.
SPEAKER_03: Feel? What is it? Feelings. You said that you cannot even hurt his feelings. Feelings. Yeah. How are you going to hurt his arm, you know? Oh, Jerry is a good guy. I don't want to hurt him. But if you made agreement before the match, Jerry, and you will tell me I don't want to be hurt with you, I can go...
SPEAKER_03: Slowly. And then maybe in the end of the year, you can have another match without injury. I'm serious. If you want, I go very slow now. That's a nice guy, huh, Jerry? Yeah, he seems like a real sweetheart, doesn't he? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: you are very sweet hearts because you are nice you don't want to hurt him yeah i'm a good guy jerry just beat this guy he's just like too much don't don't worry is big daddy jerry he is big daddy jerry's second youtube account he calls you flop king
SPEAKER_00: Do you have another one? Big Daddy YouTube account? Do you have one or two? I think there's two, right? One that I was just putting like family shit on and then the other one that I put arm on. I have no idea. You know better. Silky Wilkie, Jerry, where is the pressure on your arm when you are pulling under the opponent's hand? What muscles are you using the most? Muscles in my arms?
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah but which which ones are you using when when you are like pulling like this way he's asking well like it's a lot of tricep and shoulder or tricep and shoulder so you feel the pressure mostly on your tricep and shoulder yeah yeah yeah jerry uh do you feel like any fear you get scared when he said he's gonna break your shoulder bone this and then you do you feel like you know
SPEAKER_01: Like, you know, maybe I shouldn't. I'm just joking, Joe. No, I don't get scared, right? I fully expect Hermes to come in strong. And I pray that he's going to come in stronger than he looks right now because he looks like he's taking swimming. So maybe a little less diving and more weight training. But I'm anxious to get this match underway because, you know, this is a match that both of us wanted.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. He will be incredible. He will be incredible. But Hermes is very, very confident. This guy doesn't even take you seriously. I want to speak like Jerry. Same when I fought with Levan. If your mind, you go with...
SPEAKER_03: bad things you you will lose it's better to stay to your home and don't don't take the match every time you have you you need have a confident to do a great fight or to win it's normal this level i think so okay okay don't let jerry fool your message evil kings move
SPEAKER_00: round one to throw you off. I say you press him from the first round. He said that he's gonna do the desperation move against you. Hermes. Harry? Yeah, that's what they say, yeah. I didn't say that. Some other Joe. No, the guys, the guys say on the question, you know. Keyboard move. Desperation move, desperation move.
SPEAKER_00: When you use this move, this desperation move, it's like you already lose the match, you are finished. Yeah. They say that Engin is translated from English to English, which is because sometimes it is easier to
SPEAKER_00: originally English speaking people to understand each other. Like sometimes it's easier than understanding original English speaker. Sean, my friends, hello. Most of Jerry's effort while pressing is from his tongue, he says. That's the muscle that you are using the most. Okay. Last, Prokopcik versus Doug Ehrlich, Hermes.
SPEAKER_00: You know, Douglas is the one that beat Coach Ray in the last event. Ah. Yeah, with, with, with kind of tough. Prokofiev is very strong. So you think Prokofiev is going to win? Yeah. Hmm. And Adam Wardenski, Basho Saginashvili. Basho Saginashvili, we don't really know him. This guy is a very young guy.
SPEAKER_00: He is the parent of Lewa. He is his relative. They say cousin, but I don't know exactly. But they say his cousin. And everyone is saying that the guy is incredibly strong. And they convinced me. And they are so sure about themselves that he's going to beat Adam Wozniacki. But it's hard to predict about the match because we don't know the guy. Adam is incredibly strong.
SPEAKER_00: He beat Bojidar. Bojidar is also super high-level puller. So, I don't know. We will see. And Brandon versus Samusha. Do you know Brandon's assessor? He beat Craig Tuller at the last Michael's event, Monster Factory. He beat 3-2 Craig Tuller. And now he's going to pull against Samusha. Uh...
SPEAKER_00: Sorry, but I don't remember now. Yeah, and you know Samusha, right, Jerry? Yeah. And Samusha versus Brendan, how do you see that match? What's the weight cap? 187. But probably he will be 200 pounds by the time of competition. Down to 20. Brendan's got to be walking around weight 20. Yeah, yeah. I think he's very near
SPEAKER_00: 205 or something right now but he said that he's gonna lose the last 10 pounds with water water loss and then uh and then he's gonna gain weight that's what he says well i think it's going to be tough to lose that much weight but if he can maintain his strength i'll take him
SPEAKER_00: This is not real Devon Larratt. This is somebody put, I think. If he would be real Devon Larratt, he would just ask me by WhatsApp message. And in our event, there are another match. We are in the end of the event. It's finished. We are finished. We say the last words to the
SPEAKER_00: um our fans and then we can we can finish it yeah do you want to say anything to go to jerry hermes before we finish good luck good luck
SPEAKER_03: If you really want it, do you think you can hurt Jerry? No, I don't want. No, you don't want. But if you really want, do you think you are capable of doing it? You have the power to do it, you think? If I want, yes. If I want, I can hurt him. But I don't want because he's a very good guy. He's very friendly.
SPEAKER_03: Well, thanks for going awful nice to you. He made me angry or not. Depends. In the press conference. Oh, if he talks too much shit at the press conference, don't speak too much. Very don't speak bad words. And maybe I don't hurt him. Jerry.
SPEAKER_01: This guy is really provocative. I don't know what you're going to do with him, but... I'll have to bring him like a bottle of wine at the press conference or something. Maybe a bottle of wine and some roses. Oh, you really need that? Looks like you are intimidated, Jerry. Yeah, right? I'm super scared.
SPEAKER_01: he he are already scared of me my friend look at this face okay okay okay he can't speak i thought that what you say is gonna provocate him so i was wrong about it sorry no he he can't provoke me he's uh he's just a little kid they're gonna call me big daddy he's gonna be calling me daddy after the match baby
SPEAKER_03: I have already a daddy. He already started. See? Did you hear that? Did he say he was the dad? I don't understand what he means. I don't understand a thing. He said that after he beats you, you're going to call him daddy. And then you just said daddy? That's what I'm saying. I have already a daddy, my friend, here in Italy. I don't need your daddy, my friend.
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, guys, thank you very much. It has been a long time. You know, by the way, Hermes, he meant like he's going to beat you and then he's going to make you say, I'm your daddy. You know, it means that like I'm stronger than you. That's what he means. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. We will see. Okay. Anyways, guys, thank you very much. By the way, you look really big, my friend, really big. I can say that, you know, Hermes is lucky.
SPEAKER_03: that you find it very big, very big. You can go to 300 kilos, but it's not important. The important, remember, is the quality, quality power, quality technique and smart. I think last time we were doing this, we we lifted our shirts up and compared and it was quality was on me and quantity was on you.

Yeah, but you will have to leave the pack and you will get fouled. No, you put in my mouth the Coca-Cola.
