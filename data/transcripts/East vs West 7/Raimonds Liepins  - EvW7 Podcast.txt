SPEAKER_03: Give me a second. I'll check how this looks. I'm sorry. We are live now. Yeah, it shows. Yeah, yeah. And it's fine. And we're side by side. Okay, that's good. That's good. So how have you been? I'm doing good. I'm doing fine. That's good. You've been working diligently.
SPEAKER_00: every single day oh yeah yeah that that is the way to be successful in my opinion about anything discipline yeah so they're like three weeks away right no not even 16 days 16 days or even less oh damn it right yeah oh
SPEAKER_00: It's so close. Do you know how I can make these chats disappear because I cannot see you? There's a chat icon on top right corner and then you can hide all chat messages and then it will not show them. Okay. Hide all chat messages. Yes. Okay. So I can follow from computer. Yeah. So
SPEAKER_03: what do you think about the card you think it is one of the best till now or every time we do it i i get there and i tell you like this is probably the best card we have ever seen and every time it's true so i feel like this is no exception it looks just amazing like the matches
SPEAKER_00: at the start i was thinking some of the matches i'm like this doesn't make sense in my head and closer every match is like yep yep yeah yeah but also it is hard right most because it is east versus west you need to make pairs from east and west you are not you are i mean i do east versus east as well but mostly they are east versus west and it is not like you can do any match in the world but it needs to be
SPEAKER_00: East and West. And so I do my best. And the reason that it's getting better and better, it is only because of our potential as a sport. When I start doing this, they are like, oh, you're killing the excitement. You're sending so many matches.
SPEAKER_00: Soon we will be out of matches. No, that is the way to grow. You need to give chances to everyone. If you circle around five, six top arm wrestlers, of course. But if you give chances to the new guys, and then soon you will see that the pool is much bigger than what we have been trying to portray. The world is much bigger than five.
SPEAKER_00: oh yeah yeah people always saw just maybe 10 armistice now they know about a hundred at least you know and it's just gonna get bigger well the only reason we didn't get bigger is because we didn't give opportunity now if you give them opportunity you do the qualifications you help them to have a dream and then you will see that a lot of people from all around the world will be dreaming about it they will grow because
SPEAKER_00: I mean, arm wrestling, I always say, Ramos, this is probably the most popular sport in the public. Go to any class you want in the schools. You ask them, who is the best arm wrestler? They say, I'm number one. This is number two. This is number three. How do they know this? Because it is so popular. But it just couldn't go from that level to the mainstream. That's my opinion.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, people need to see and they need to know that this is possible, that you can make armwrestling a living or whatever. And they will see it. I always say there are three things everyone has done in their lifetime. We all have three sports. We all have run, we all have a little bit of fighting, and we have all armwrestled. So it's top three in the world, without a doubt. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: not sure if three like there is like swimming and other things but some people yeah maybe they didn't but as you said this for sure one of the most natural things uh among humankind yeah yeah way way way before i even knew what was armistice i i have done it you know so yeah yeah this is culturally it is like i don't think there is
SPEAKER_00: like there are many other sports which are invented like later on you understand like a game or something but but arm wrestling do you really believe that there is any corner on this earth even arm wrestling became an organized sport do you think that there was any corner in this world that people were not arm wrestling i really don't believe so yeah
SPEAKER_00: Even Africa or Australia, South America, Asia, Europe, everywhere, you know, people are missiles, you know. And imagine nobody is really even organizing this. This is just in public, naturally. Yeah, it's kind of one of those things that everyone stumbles on. Everyone kind of finds it. So, yeah, we have heard and seen.
SPEAKER_03: so there's a i wanted to ask you about the qualifiers uh we will have the final of uh east side right here on may 6th right yeah in the morning may 5th is the way yeah okay uh and and then the qualifier from the for the west is june 30th or something right oh third okay yeah and then then the winners of the right arm from
SPEAKER_00: east and from the west will meet in in the next event we need to we need to discuss about this okay i am going to invite every winner as i promised with right arm woman or man with left arm i will consider but no promises but if we think the matchup is not really even yes yeah do you think that i can still
SPEAKER_00: invite the guy but just invite someone like different and then even from this guy of course because his payer will be now single and now we invite someone from us just to make it more you understand like or i should just go i don't care if it is even a match or not even a match let's pull each other this is how i should i don't know how the how the community will react yeah i i think
SPEAKER_03: you know when you when you give the opportunity and if you're the winner of let's say west and you are given the opportunity and maybe the challenge on the east or the other way around is too big i think you should still give that opportunity it's for people to show like i think they kind of deserve it even even though no no no no they they will be invited for sure but it's a different match
SPEAKER_00: This is what I am saying. Of course, I'm going to invite everyone. The six winners from the West, they will be invited, as I promised. But the thing is, if I think that it is heavily one-sided, if it looks that way,
SPEAKER_00: You understand? Or if I say this and then the guy will be offended. The other guy say like, how can you think that this is heavily, you know, one sided or I don't know how to deal with this without hurting anyone else at same time, you know, providing a fair match. You understand? Like not fair, but it's just like, you only match. I don't know what to do. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,
SPEAKER_03: I think after the finals we'll kind of see what the situation is and then you can figure it out. Because maybe some new young guys will win and we don't know where they rank, you know.
SPEAKER_00: but um i'm excited i think it's uh it's another thing you kind of brought back that we already talked for years where big tournaments we needed yeah yes it's not really big tournaments but at least we did a tournament you were saying that i need to do tournaments but we did it tournament in fact none of those events are my tournaments those are all uh
SPEAKER_00: private events but you know we just add the east versus west qualification so we are really uh making connection between tournaments you understand like from east coast to west coast of you know north america even south america i think that you we need to sit down and talk about these things you know like we need to provide something for we have the south africa they are coming to they did we have like lebanon they are coming to we have some turkish
SPEAKER_00: coming through but we need to do some for asia we need to do some like just think about japan and the or kenya you know like new zealand australia you know we need to provide we need to give for example south africa south america more than one event maybe two events because in north america we have what's that six in america uh and then us and then two in canada in north america we have
SPEAKER_00: eight qualification while we installed we had one one qualification uh gabriella was cancerless classic um i think it's it's all it's all gonna like first this is pretty much first time you do it so next time you do it
SPEAKER_03: promoters are going to get in or country is going to get more involved. And the good thing is for them just to know that they can do this. Because I thought there's going to be a little bit more in Europe. But I think it's it's it's pretty good for the first time. And after this finished, we have the second ones. And so it's just that he was gonna do one in Romania and then at the last moment, but I think in July, we will have one in Russia. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And then there are some European countries that are not part of the European Union. They may have visa problems. Maybe we could do like I heard that some of those countries that are not in the Balkans, I think some of them.
SPEAKER_03: see everyone's was watching like england wants to give everyone a chance to compete yes he's looking he's looking at like this i wouldn't even think about something like this you're like hey maybe these guys like visa problems they can't travel around maybe we should give you know i mean just like just like i i just like or just some countries let them just come like five guys you know directly you understand just say i don't know which countries are not european but they they somebody made a comment
SPEAKER_00: I couldn't answer. I didn't know what to say. He may think that I ignore him. I didn't ignore. Since then, it is just one more weight in my brain. Yeah, like what to do, you know, because how can you ignore? How can you ignore someone who loves our message? You can't. Yeah, that is true. That is true. Yeah. So let's talk about East versus West.
SPEAKER_03: east versus west seven by the way by the way who are coming from uh latvia finalized for the qualification uh a lot of guys are still kind of trying to figure but for sure it's me kristaps blumens janice is coming but janice uh maybe maybe so maybe i understand it's yadis you know
SPEAKER_03: yeah those are those are finalized and maybe some others but uh uh and then from lithuania those who qualified or you know uh we'll give their place to them and they're gonna come now also so we should be like 10 10 12 people at least oh there is one uh mega flies what about sweden norway feeling my friend we did the qualification in uh norway
SPEAKER_00: We did one in Riga, Latvia. We cannot really do in every European country. I mean, maybe we should, I don't know. But I mean, like one is here, Riga, the one is here, Norway, you know, I mean, anyone from Finland or Sweden could make it and I think they did this. Yes, Swedish guys came and some Latvians stole their places there. They're bad, but...
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah by the way the guys are thinking that you know i i i leveled up the podcast setup this is we were we are normally using uh zoom zoom this time i did it i saw the thing you know it says that youtube has like you can invite directly it's good it's just full screen it looks perfect on my phone it looks like i'm up there
SPEAKER_00: And I'm not here, but whenever we put it, yeah, I see that on computer, we are side by side, you know? Okay. On a phone, we look like this. I think on a phone it puts like, we're seeing this. So it's, it's really good. It's a good feature from YouTube. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, you can see that it filled the screen perfectly. You don't need to turn anything, click on anything. Okay. Let's let's go. Let's go to.
SPEAKER_00: East versus West matches. Let's start from the lightest in this event. Douglas versus Daniel. Douglas says that he is like 15% better today than that time. And he sends me some screenshots from his private messages to Daniel.
SPEAKER_03: like he's gonna beat him or say and then daniel just doesn't get involved so much he said okay good luck you know but he he's harassing him already yeah yeah it's a tough call to beat uh daniel prokopchuk daniel is one of those guys that uh i think outranks his power is way outside his weight class and uh uh doug came back he just faced me he beat me easily and uh
SPEAKER_00: Did you underestimate him? No, no, no, no. Did you think you were disappointed? You thought that you would beat him?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I thought I was going to beat him. In my head, and this is where I lost it all, I should have gone for the straps from the start. But in my head, I was so stubborn. I will not... I think round two you tried, but he was holding on. Yeah, for round two, I tried to top roll. Like, Sam was like, try top roll. I'm like, and it doesn't work with my arm. So...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm going to try and improve that ever since that match. You mean top roll or going strapped? Going strapped. Going strapped, yeah. Because I so much rely on my hand. It's just going to do the work and eventually I'm going to get in. Most of the time guys are slipping from me, but it was just, yeah. I hope Douglas does really good so I look not that bad.
SPEAKER_03: But yeah, you're saying that, you know, you hope that he's going to travel at least Daniel or beat him so that you wouldn't feel. Yeah. Yeah. If he beats him, that would be probably one of the biggest upsets on the card, to be honest. That's Daniel Prokopchuk. Daniel is insanely strong. We all know that. The level of caliber of armors he has faced in both worlds or even here, it's insane. And
SPEAKER_03: i don't know what's like when i saw him pulling david samush here i thought it's over after the first one because he was in control he was kind of playing with it and then david changed his style and you know beat him and you know it was weird but and i don't know if he's still injured inside because he never went hook for hook and his hook is his main weapon we all know that now he kind of tries to top roll a little more because he can
SPEAKER_00: But I think he's a little bit hurt here. He already put like thousands of miles on that elbow with all that worse, you know, because he often got toppled by good top rollers. Yeah. I think for me and Doug, we talked and I said, like, you have to
SPEAKER_03: top roll him fast and finish quick if you get in a scramble with him it's not going to be good because he he doesn't die he can you remember finals with chelcastle you know this you know so what was it 12 minutes 10 minutes 12 minutes yeah yeah i was i was at the front row i was i was commenting commentating for the olympic channel
SPEAKER_00: And then I look at it, I was like, I don't know, it's just like, probably it's like, like deja vu, you know, like, like, like, it's just like, it's not moving. Something happened, like, you know how it is, I felt when I used to live in US, I had Corvette, I had Pontiac Trans Am, we often did the 400 meters, you know, quarter mile, the you know, race.
SPEAKER_00: uh and then whenever you are also you know your opponent is also very fast car you know and then you you look at it you are like up to 200 kilometer an hour and then because the other car is right by you you feel like
SPEAKER_00: Like you are not going in a way. Yeah. You're not moving because the guy is just like, you are like, how is that like 200 kilometer? I would be like, you know, but when the other guy is the same speed, you know, you feel like it's like time is frozen. I felt the same. Yeah. When you are evenly matched and that was happening there, it was both of our very evenly matched.
SPEAKER_00: So I wish good luck to both, but I think Daniel is a clear favorite in every book. And if Doug surprises us, it will be a major upset, and I wish him good luck with that. The guy is strong. I sometimes see that the ways that he is lifting, and of course, it's not all about the weight, but the guy is also a good arm wrestler. But his biggest weapon is here. He really believes. He wants so much. And he doesn't look intimidated.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. He has big dreams. You can be scared of anyone who is strong, who is smart, and also has big dreams that he believes in. We will see. And then let's go Brandon, Assasort, and David. As good as Brandon is, David is insane. And I really don't know where Brandon ranks with him. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Davit Samushki. It's hard to go against the champ and he's been very, very dominant after his return. And his first match was just ball in. He lost that one. And I think he's just gotten better and better and better and better. And Davit is always dangerous. Yeah. There is a super chat. Three words. Abi, selamun aleykum. Kosovo, iki kere tutuşmuşun değil mi? Yok kardeşim. Aleyküm selam. Kosovo, hiç maç yapmadım ben.
SPEAKER_00: Did you know that I almost, almost said Minda Agos and Cerkasov yesterday? Minda Agos yesterday said, is there any way that I can compete the qualifications in Istanbul? But he said he's not qualified. And I said, I would love to, but I'm sure people will complain. You know, they will say that you are not qualified, you know, and how can you allow him?
SPEAKER_00: And I said, I cannot do that because people will complain rightfully. And then I said, but just wait, you know me. So what's your WhatsApp number? Write me. And this, this, this, this. We almost made the deal. And then he realized that he had a super match with Arthur Makarov in Moscow. It's what he told me. He said that he better concentrate that one. Yeah. And yeah. So we will see.
SPEAKER_03: will be that's a good match that's that's a definitely uh insane match either arm whatever arm they do would be great yeah i think my partner would beat him my opinion oh yeah yeah i think he's too big yeah they pulled before and before and he injured him in a russian event
SPEAKER_00: Russian nationals some years ago. Anyway, so you are saying that I have a question while we talk about David Samusha match. Zolev went to AMC events and Zolev lost. And this guy, Degurno or Degurnet, I forgot his name. He's from Ossetia. He was a young guy. And then two weeks later, they just pulled at Russian nationals and Zolev killed him. Only two weeks later.
SPEAKER_00: he won he won the first place while he was like one of the last place at amc i don't understand that i don't understand so now i was thinking him to have a title match against the winner of the uh brandon and samusha
SPEAKER_00: But now, I don't know, he lost at AMC, but he beat the AMC champion like nothing at the Russian Nationals. So, what would you suggest? Yeah, Salmat Degurov. Degurov, yeah. Lagia. Lagia, thank you, my friend. So, last time Zaluya was here, he, first of all, he beat Todd Hutchings, then he lost to John, right? Yeah, he was in incredible shape, and then he pulled John, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And then the war started and we couldn't invite him here. I don't know, did he have those wars with Zvetan before he faced the guy or did he beat him fresh for fresh? No.
SPEAKER_00: fresh for fresh yeah he lost like to that guy and then he lost uh because that guy never went to the b-side yeah okay yeah okay yeah i don't know like if i would that's i would give him a title shot any day he deserves yeah yeah but but you know like you know whenever he he takes like it if you say a legend match yeah any moment
SPEAKER_00: But whenever you say that way, he had to, and he did it. He beat the guy, you know. Anyway, so let's go to the next one. Adam Worzinski, Basho Saginashvili.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know about Bacho like anything, like, you know, as much as everyone has told the stories. But what I saw Adam do was so impressive that it's hard to bet against him. I know how strong Borzder Simenov is and he pretty much toyed with him, held him in the center and pinned him. And
SPEAKER_03: i i think adam is so dedicated he's so smart and uh like if you give him a chance to prepare for a super match i think he's coming in a super shape but i would be i would be happy to see you know surprise or something but i i feel like i just don't know how strong bachelor is and especially if you don't compete you know and we we see this a lot of times if you're
SPEAKER_03: If your technique isn't press, you need time to warm up more than anyone else. Even with the press, you need a warm up. You know, you need to understand the feel on the table and how it feels in real situations. When if you haven't competed in a while, and I don't know if Bacho has, I would pick Adam any day. Yeah, that's interesting. This guy, I always say this in the podcast, I saw him when he was 14 years old. He won the U15 competition.
SPEAKER_00: in Romania, 2019 rough. He was beating every one he faced, you know, at the side table, you know, the senior guys. And this guy is now 18 years old, four years later. And the interesting thing is that he doesn't train with any of those known Georgian guys. He's somewhere else. He has his own group. He's not like near Zurab team or like Iraq-Ganadi team. The guy is just, I don't know how he can just come in
SPEAKER_00: beat everyone if he would be training with those really known experienced Georgians and I would just say that oh yeah I mean he that is experienced to pull with those guys but so he needs to be really really uh he uh freaked um Costas Adam wasn't 10 kilo more one was 86 the other one is 92 there was six kilo difference
SPEAKER_03: but still you know but yeah anyways so you are saying Adam is gonna win most likely I I don't I don't know I I'm just picking Adam based on based on what I know you know I understand yeah yeah but in every match I would love a surprise in everything if everything would be predictable in arm wrestling it's getting really really boring really really fast yeah yeah and you are right you're right and
SPEAKER_00: let's go to another one zura versus rob today um about something about you know i shortly shortly messaged with uh heather uh rob's uh yes it was like i think something about their trip to istanbul but i forgot anyways and she said rob is feeling great and that that is what we wanted to hear because
SPEAKER_00: we know that Zurab is in great shape and we need to we needed to know that Rob is also feeling great so that that is that's good that he's feeling great yeah I think uh just based on what what Zurab did just a few weeks ago on AMC
SPEAKER_03: It's hard to bet against him. It's hard to bet against him. And I think just looking at this match, whatever, RVJ wants to get that hand. He wants to have that control. And he's not the fastest guy. Zurab doesn't care if you get that hand. He doesn't care. He has so much. And he will just dive in and just stay there as long as it needed to pin him. We saw that in a round-bat match. We have seen it many times before.
SPEAKER_03: where I could see Rob win would be if Rob was fast enough, if Rob from the goal was fast enough, because he has the style that kind of, you know, because Zurab dives in with his shoulder and just goes to the side, and RBJ will do the completely opposite, similarly to what Chan Shaw did.
SPEAKER_03: but i it's hard to bet against him it's hard to bet against him like he was in insane shape the amc it was full of killers the class was insane and he just went to everyone it wasn't like super easy but it was in a zurab's fashion zurab doesn't sometimes you will stop him you know it happens but he was just running to everyone so
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, hard, hard, hard. But I'm excited to see RBJ back and see where he ranks with, you know, rest of the armwrestling world because he is there still as long as WL hasn't said officially they are dead. You know, he is the champ. Yeah, I think to beat Zurab, controlling his pronator without losing your own pronator is the key. Just like leaving his pronator and trying to pull his hand.
SPEAKER_00: it's not gonna do anything he will have that bridge and he will still hit you so you need to really turn here once you turn here and then it's just kind of harder that that is why i thought that chan show would be very i mean effective against him so when i said that much people say oh why you said this match he's gonna kill chance and i was like you know because of the pulling style and i don't know how like i see
SPEAKER_00: rob having chance beating zura but i don't know which way he prepared himself so that that is a question mark but i see the potential and yeah and what do you think about arif versus uh this i don't know arif versus ronald
SPEAKER_00: Arif is really, really impressive every time I see him. There's a reason why he is still WF World Champion. He won last year, right? He took second to Gergely. Oh, Gergely. Yeah, before Arif won. And then next year, following him, Gergely won. Arif beat him once, but he beat him also once. So he was 2-1. Okay. Yeah, I think Arif because...
SPEAKER_03: Arif is a real heavyweight. He's been always dangerous. I like Gurgi, but I don't think he will get inside. He will get any purchase where he wants with Arif on this match. Yeah, I would go with Arif. There is a 2% trip for the Turkish guy. He says,
SPEAKER_03: You are one of the best sports in our country. Happy holidays. Thank you, brother. Thank you very much. Happy holidays. Okay, Alican Murado, Cody Merez. I don't want to give a prediction on this one. On this one, I'm going to stay in the middle and I'm going to say why. I would love if Alican would win because then it's a smaller guy beating a much, much bigger guy.
SPEAKER_03: But I also would love Corey Berry to win because Corey is awesome.
SPEAKER_03: This is the question and the answer we all will get, because what Alijan did was pretty much, we haven't seen it done before, especially in super heavyweight, someone coming up to that weight and being... But could he have done it if, let's say, Cody Merritt was in the class? And this will give us a glimpse of that. Can he take him down? Alijan is extremely strong. He's extremely... Pretty much everything is there, and that style is so...
SPEAKER_03: It works with everyone. It works with hook pullers. It works with top row. It doesn't matter. The style works. And just to see like how he will deal with all that weight and mass that Cody has, because Cody is much bigger. So there's going to be much bigger arms to rotate and everything else. I'm really excited for that match, but I'm picking it like 50-50 because I believe, I literally believe it can go both ways. It can be, you know, but what Alisson did, even with Petrenko,
SPEAKER_00: and like when petrenko was on pretty much top of the world he looked insane he looked absolutely insane and how he beat him yeah i'm excited about that warrior you know i mean i was so surprised how he started with the side way and then went a little bit like open arm and then come back and went into the hook and then even the shoulder pressure
SPEAKER_00: He did everything. I mean, to beat that guy, you really need to dominate him. But there is a possibility Cody is back pressure to dominate his wrist. If he does that, if Cody can do that, then I don't know if Ali Cenk can fight this way. If he can, then we will learn one more thing about him. We usually don't know about that because he usually gets in his...
SPEAKER_00: position. But I talked with Cody. Cody said he has been training real hard. And I don't know. I kind of think that it can go either way. But on the paper, people think that Ali Can is the favorite.
SPEAKER_03: people have short memories and people will look at them but i like this is like i said 50 50 and it's so like i really want to know i really want to know and i want to see it and i think for me this is one of the best matches of the card because it will give us like oh
SPEAKER_03: You know, and I'm excited because Alijan is insane. Cody is really good. So let's go because I think Alijan, he understands his potential. He understands his left arm potential. So eventually he wants to challenge the crown, whatever the crown is, you know, and there's no way getting around but beating the best guys with the left hand on the planet. And Cody is one of them.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about Pauline? I just checked the Rustam match again before Rustam got injured. Even if Rustam did not get injured, I don't think that Rustam was winning that round as he did the first round. I don't know if he would win or not, but that match stopped. Trust me.
SPEAKER_00: that might stop at the center. I don't think that, I think Pauline is underestimating his hook and trying this usually as the latest option as he did against John, as he did against Rambat. And his hook option always worked better than his top roll option. And what do you think?
SPEAKER_00: about him what do you think about his match versus sasha sasha is about 90 kilo while uh paul will be 95 on the scale but i'm 100 sure he will be minimum 100 203 one and a half day later because he's losing so much water for the yeah this is his professional cutting weight he's absolutely professional yeah today i saw brandon as well
SPEAKER_03: Brandon is also losing weight. He put a picture and I was like, like, how is this guy losing weight? You know, I mean, his arms, everything is there, you know, just like he's still so big. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I, for me, it's very hard to bet against Sasho just from what I have seen Sasho do. And it's very hard to top roll Sasho. It's very hard to get away from his hand. He's been improving and he's been even top rolling. We have seen it before.
SPEAKER_03: I just, I'm really interested how much horsepower Poland is going to bring because like, again, and he's fighting on Orthodox guy. Social is way smaller. Everything will be way cool. It will just like when you pull them and you're bigger guy in the weight class, you, you kind of, you don't know what's going to happen because you know, everything is like,
SPEAKER_03: who he pulled. He pulled RVJ. And RVJ was like, he's hiding his thumb. It's just how he takes the grip, you know. I believe Sasho, sorry, Paul Lynch should try hook him, smart hook him, because I believe there's better. Of course, he should test if he can top roll him. But with that, he can lose his back pressure, pronator, everything else. And if you sometimes hit too hard, you know, muscles will
SPEAKER_00: damage get damaged as well for the next rounds so i believe hook you should try to beat him in a hook if that happens we don't see we don't see some someone toppling sascha that's right i mean like if you tell me going outside against sascha i was the one yeah but he will be hitting you all the time like like somebody is kicking your arm to the side way you know
SPEAKER_03: yes and and he will do this once and then he'll do the second and it's and it's over uh but we have seen a lot of times when he gets in a hook when someone drives him in a hook and kind of surprises him and paul lynn
SPEAKER_03: But Paul has that bicep type of hook. He doesn't engage with the shoulder coming backwards with the arm going forward. He engages like this. So I believe he has some things he can do there. If he can separate that arm, get on that pronator,
SPEAKER_03: I'm excited for that match. I think it's going to be war. I'm picking Sancho. I would love if Paul Lynn could keep going, keep this dream alive. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Paul's one of those guys that is mentally very strong. And professional. I remember when I first heard about him,
SPEAKER_00: in wl days and he was like the next guy in line and everyone's like talk the best guy he's so nice and then you meet him and he's of course so nice yeah yeah yeah but but you know he improved a lot oh yeah yeah a lot yeah he improved a lot you know every event i see him he's not the same guy you know no and and from other sides i saw i'm telling you like
SPEAKER_00: one of the most dangerous guys you know you you may have seen him losing a couple of times in hook but but not with top row not with top row it's very hard so let's go to the next one vitaly laletin versus
SPEAKER_03: Tobias Porong. Yeah, I don't know. Last time I talked with Vitaly, he said his left was a little bit injured and he was a little bit behind. Then he said he's going to pull tournament that's only for lefty. It was after he faced Dave Chaffee. He won the tournament easily. I think Tobias is very, very dangerous, but it's hard to go against Vitaly. If Vitaly comes in prepared and his arm is healthy,
SPEAKER_03: He's been, you know, ever since he pulled in WF, he's been the guy. You know, when he started rising to the top, he was insane. And yeah, it's hard to bet against Vitaly, in my opinion. Plus now he has, we see he has a lot of heart and he can, we have seen long matches from him. I think that was on left arm, right? The one where they were just sitting in the center. That was the left arm match. Right arm. Right arm. Right arm. Right arm.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah 10 10 minutes yeah and the whole table was like like a lake lake you know yeah they were like sweating like yeah i looked at from the the giant screen that the whole table you could see like there was like a water on it you know just not like wet but wow and and he was so patient he waited waited waited 10 minutes and then at the end he slowly won yeah
SPEAKER_03: He's a smart guy. He's very calm, smart guy. Yes, yes. Patient, strong. It's hard to bet against him. But if Tobias beats him or at least wins, I will not be surprised. He's very dangerous. We saw it in his past super matches. He's very, very good and just getting better, just getting better. Especially trying to topple him is very hard. Yes, yes. Can you say that these two guys have the strongest grip?
SPEAKER_00: in the armwrestling community, number one, number two. Oh, you really? I didn't know that. Yeah, they do. What's that thing that they are squeezing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They are number one and number two with the numbers, yeah. That's cool. Do you realize when Morozov tried to top roll him, he just left arm. And then Marcio didn't even try to. I think one time he tried, he didn't blow, so he hook him because his hand, wrist is just so strong. That is why I'm thinking.
SPEAKER_00: It is because the low hand, Kapral versus Tobias, that strong, high knuckle, you know, with the incredible grip. I'm just thinking, like, what if, what if? Yes, on the paper, yeah, Laletin looks favorite. But as you said, we get these matches by hoping that there may be some surprises. Yeah. I will not be surprised if either of those guys wins because I think both of them can do it.
SPEAKER_03: yeah and we will know because Vitalik hasn't competed in a long time with left arm very long time so like internationally yeah and let's go to Dev Shafi versus Rewaz
SPEAKER_03: It's for me, it's always very hard to bet against Dave Chafee because this is just a powerhouse, just insane. I think Revis will take away the size issue because I think Revis is bigger. He's taller, I think, and heavier. So I'm excited for this. It's hard to bet against Dave when Dave figured out he can pull without the hand because Dave's like, hey.
SPEAKER_03: You know, and you have to be, you have to be like Hermes, Hermes type of puller to beat him. Revas is good. Definitely will. If Revas takes his hand, that will be impressive.
SPEAKER_00: You know, like takes his hand and let's see what Dave does. Even if he takes his wrist, if Dave has the tornado, may he go and then maybe switch to the shoulder pressure? Can Revas do what Hermes did? We don't know. Maybe yes, maybe no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a great heavyweight match. And both of those guys are kind of... You know, I love that Dave's been pulling everyone.
SPEAKER_03: know dave's been there pulling literally everyone i think he might be the only guy in top 10 who has faced almost everyone you know so or not almost i think everyone so yeah this is good this is absolutely great match tomorrow is a holiday here so some turkish guys are within the
SPEAKER_03: Good holidays. Okay. Okay, let's go to the last two matches. Ongar Bey versus Irakli. Yeah. As impressive as Irakli is, it's hard to, like, the way he moves on table, it's, like Yano said, like, it's intuitive. Like, he just feels he has to do something and he does it. His match versus Michael Todd,
SPEAKER_03: was so impressive after even losing the first round. That was insane. That was a masterclass in arm wrestling. You just have to look and watch and just like all those small movements, all those adjustments facing someone with a style he has definitely never faced. And, you know, with the experience that Michael Todd has. So he was super impressive. Irakli improved, improved, improved, and he's gotten really dangerous.
SPEAKER_00: what he did with john when he lost his hand i was absolutely like i we never we never expected no none of us none of us expected searching yeah if you would just say that before the man john is going to topple iraqi and iraqi is going to beat him with that wrist i would bet you 10 000 10 000 i would bet you yeah it wouldn't happen that yeah
SPEAKER_03: we would all be living on streets because because it was like it was the thing that like oh he lose the hand like usually top rollers lose the hand and they just lay down try again that's you know the usual path and no he didn't but round two round three or four
SPEAKER_00: He held him and he was like trying to beat him like this and then while he had the full control he could finish it a different way and then once he couldn't finish it and then the match came and then suddenly finished the other way you know.
SPEAKER_00: Or maybe I'm wrong, but it seemed like he was looking for fantasy. Like, you beat me that way, so let me beat you. Yeah, yeah, because John is different. It's weird. His mind is working for him to win in the way that he wants to win. It's more important than winning the game. You cannot find anyone else. Nobody, of course, if you are so comfortable, you do it. But this guy is trying mission, sometimes mission impossible.
SPEAKER_00: and there is no other person would risk the match like devon does all kind of things too but he knows that the guy is exhausted you know he can do it john is not doing this you know john is just like i want to win that way you know okay you know yeah it's that's definitely john because he needs to he needs to get those victories in his mind like he's just like oh you know those are the things uh
SPEAKER_03: So for me, I still feel like Kitty Gally has been a ninety hundred kilos forever. That's his weight. Just pretty much got there like two years ago. As much as, you know, he's great, insane, the strength parameters that he's lifting is just out of this world for a guy his size.
SPEAKER_03: I still would pick Ketagali in this month. And I believe Ketagali is going to take his hand. And I don't think any of those guys will pull inside. I think he's going to take his hand. He's got a high ground and he's going to work from that. Let's see what Irakli does. Can he do what he did if he loses the hand? Can he take the hand of Ketagali? I think it's a great match, especially for a championship match. Both guys deserve it. And in my opinion, whoever wins needs to face Todd Hutchings.
SPEAKER_03: oh right because that would be that would be and and then let's uh set up one of the rematches for john because i would love to see those again doesn't matter which one doesn't matter which one yeah because even in that match with the uh with uh iraqli john sit next to me and i'm i'm like what the hell happened he's like i don't know i don't know i thought i thought that
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to, you know, work and then I get in a bad spot. And then I thought round five, the strap is going to be on him. She should be better. She's like, eh. And he's like, and that was too late. And that was too late. So, yeah. Yeah. The guy is just, he's unique, unique. He's weird. He's from different planets. His mind is not working like ours, you know, different working. Anyway, so let's go to the last match.
SPEAKER_00: Devon Lara versus Gennady Kvikvinya. Gennady Kvikvinya is one of those guys that you also closely know because of years of WAF European competition. You have seen him, at least the late career of him, because you are also young, right? How old are you? 33. Oh, you are not that young, but still, probably your years are...
SPEAKER_00: Maybe after 2010 or something. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And again, it was around like 2005, 2006 or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so what do you think about everything? Everything.
SPEAKER_03: I don't follow that old drama or whatever the Devon is always trying to put on, but I will sometimes watch the videos and they are really funny. I can't say just like, especially how he signs off by again, you know, I'm not going to repeat anything, but, uh,
SPEAKER_03: It's really funny. And I think it's the match that WL tried to set it up years ago, 2019, 20, something like that. And now we're going to see it. And for me, this is awesome because finally I'll see Devin Larratt in super heavyweight that is not...
SPEAKER_03: 11 seconds really so he's facing someone there because i believe we are seeing prime devon larrett as much as anyone wants to say devon in that time i don't believe it i believe this is the prime devon larrett and he's just getting stronger and stronger better and better uh he went away like we had a lot of talks with him and i said like i'm like
SPEAKER_03: You will always have that Kings move that he created. You will always have. Why not be strong here? And we kind of bullied him and he started being strong where he was strong when he was younger. Because at one point he thought that his angles were not working. He was always too open. He was always like Kings moving. But that was because that's all he was doing on table. He wasn't really trying to take the center. He was always putting everyone in that position where they are
SPEAKER_03: pressing and he's sitting. He developed that. So he has a great defense close to the pad. And I think Adam said it perfectly. Devon is so great at not losing. And he is so great at not losing. But who he's facing? He's facing Gennady Kukinian. You can go in, type in any Gennady's matches at any point. Do you agree that you said that Devon is the best Devon we have ever seen? But do you also think that
SPEAKER_00: the Gennady that we will see will most likely be the best Gennady that we have ever seen because of the importance of this match. According to him, yes. According to people who train with him, also yes. Just imagine, Ray, if you had a very important match, would you not be at your best? Yeah. I definitely think that for...
SPEAKER_03: Gennady will come in great shape. That's what I'm thinking. The evolution, what I see with Devin is Devin coming from whatever that was like five years ago or three years ago to this version of Devin is absolutely like, in my opinion, he's he probably like, first of all, he has best one of the best table, like the things that he can do on table, manipulate the match and everything else. I don't think anyone has ever done it better than him. Now he has elbow integrity.
SPEAKER_03: wrist, everything is healthy, strong. Endurance is always there. And the way he trains now, he just gets better on those, some specific motions and things like that. He is probably evolved to this. And like, in my opinion, like he doesn't need a camp. He just continuously works on getting better. Healthy, better, strong. The one that we saw against Prudnik, and again, that we are expecting to see,
SPEAKER_00: that Gennady would beat Devon, the 115-gauge Devon? I think, you know what happened in that match? Like, I think Devon was worried. Devon was very, very worried because he didn't know how much to expect. This is why the first round took forever. You're talking about Prudnik? I don't know. Because remember, his son, his son had a surgery. You know what he told me? He changed the date of his son's surgery.
SPEAKER_00: But you know what he told me? He was going to have his son's surgery. He was going to wait and take him to the home. And then ask him, like, you know, my son, like, I really want to. And he was going to get the first plane. And his arrival time was only three, four hours before the event. And he was just going to directly go and pull against Bruton. They pull in Belgium, I think, not France.
SPEAKER_03: And my friend, he knew what to expect. Prudnik also knew. For me to convince Prudnik, it took till like 3 a.m. in the morning. No, no, no. What I meant was, if you look at the, like, practice is practice. And he was, we talked and he said, in that practice, it felt like Prudnik wasn't giving me all the things.
SPEAKER_03: And he said it felt comfortable because it was right after Germany and we met in Germany. And I said, I just think you're that strong. And I think on the first one, he was expecting something more. And then he figured out he could pretty much take full control. My friend, you know better than us that how many hours all the weak people in Germany. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: and then he went and did that but he said like he's like i was worried because we talked afterwards in january and he said like i was worried because i thought he wasn't he was hiding something from me like he was playing possum a little bit and i i believe i think devon is like
SPEAKER_03: That Devon that faced Prudnik, that Devon that faced Sandris, and the Devon that we're going to see now, it's like one level two. Yeah, I agree. I don't know if it's the stem cells or everything, and it's kind of he just... I don't think that he discovered anything that anybody or he didn't know before. I think the only thing is that I think he is healthier right now. Healthier. Healthier, yeah. And trust me,
SPEAKER_00: ray as someone who has had like so many injuries still injured like just fixing one injured area make it healthy it automatically gives you like 10 15 because you are not using that area because it's first so whenever you are feeling healthy you are like a newborn with with the old experience and knowledge of
SPEAKER_00: decades you know yeah and that is what i see with the guy and but i will never understand how this guy can pull every day every day every day hours and hours and hours like i mean even you are like 17 18 years old you cannot do that i mean that is another different guy you know that these guys are not from this course
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah okay we thought we talked maybe too much about devon but we have like gennady because i think the biggest threat for sure will be the first rounds where gennady has full power and he just goes to the pin pad and the real question is can devon stop in there because devon devon
SPEAKER_03: never loses the side pressure game with most people. And I think he has developed something to stop right in the center, but I don't think it's going to work with Gennady. And the real question is, can he stop him right away and how much power Gennady will produce? Because he's definitely coming. This is the biggest match of his life. There's never going to be more eyes on you than in this match. So Gennady is preparing for...
SPEAKER_03: for absolute war and he's like he's always been explosive and he pulls different styles and he can hit hook and he can hit top row lately he's been losing a lot of times his hand um
SPEAKER_03: And me and Giannis, we talked about, Giannis said like perfectly, you don't have to go for control in this match. Sometimes you want to get the hand control. Don't think about getting hand control with Devin. Try to pin him as fast as you can. And if he does that and he has enough power to take away all the engagement, doesn't play the mind tricks, you know, all the games on table, doesn't wait for 20 minutes set up. No, no. Everything will be like 30 seconds set up. And then if no grip, then there will be no grip. Will it?
SPEAKER_00: will it be uh if i were referee i would do it i mean like i mean you know you know how good referee you know how good referee there is so i mean for sure one of the few best referees in the world and did you know that kevin wolf will be referee yeah did you know that no you know kevin kevin wolf from germany oh yeah kevin yeah yeah sorry yeah he will be there he will be ref in here
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, he's a good friend of mine. Yeah, Kevin's coming. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There is a tripartite polytalia singer and you will you get Devon a bee haircut in Turkey. I don't know what bee haircut, but the bee therapy that Devon showed is something also known here over here. I don't know if it's in Latvia. Do they do that? What is that? What is that? That they made the bee think Devon's ant.
SPEAKER_00: Did you not see? Just for healing purpose. Yeah, yeah. We do here as well. And then people were thinking that he was bullshitting. I don't know if he was bullshitting, but really we use it over here. Yeah. So you intentionally put a B, it will sting you? Yeah, yeah. Where the injury area? Did he stung his thumb? It was somewhere. I don't remember. Over his hand somewhere, I think it was. But yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So you are saying that Devon is favorite? Yeah, it's hard to bet against Devon just from everything I have seen. And I think if you give him enough rounds, he can outwork everyone. You have to be really, really special with strength like Levon was. If he doesn't get injured on anything, Devon is insane.
SPEAKER_03: he's insane on taking control of losing positions so yeah i'm really excited for that one because i i i also think that uh ghanani can be just just go rip right through him straight away yeah that reference needs to be careful you know like if it is because we said any sleep as long as it's not pin and it is not foul it's a strap so referee needs to be
SPEAKER_00: careful if it is about, he shouldn't say it's pin. If it is pin, he shouldn't say it was about. So they need to be very careful with those starts and they need to make sure that there is no early starts from either guys. Everything needs to be there. That's why people, people, I mean, like referees needs to be, need to really read the match. I mean, I'm not going to teach anyone because they are great guys, but, um, by the way, I also started training.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, so you're coming. Because I see all these posts every time. It's like Engin coming out of retirement for 10,000 times. And then you're like, no, no, no. Are you coming back? Do you feel good? Because you got bicep tear, right? The last one was bicep tear. Yeah, bicep tear. But I don't know. My bicep doesn't seem to reach
SPEAKER_00: hundred percent as before either. I still maybe need to train and then see, um, I did some stem cell elbows, maybe, maybe feeling better. I'm not sure because I didn't really start training. I trained with Yusuf. I can, if I start to do like, if I go far, you know, I can topple him, but normally in the past I could just wait. He can put all his power. I would just hold you and go down and bring up.
SPEAKER_00: Now I'm able to do, um, uh, those kinds of things, but you know, I don't want to make it really high level, uh, like highest level stuff. Like I wouldn't just go and try to, uh, pull 85 kg, a tidal mesh or something, but I don't know if I can.
SPEAKER_03: come back i i don't know you you still want to test if you see because you you no one stays out of arm wrestling everyone you like and i think you you're of all people you're just so itchy just to get back is it uh so so you just want to kind of check the water where your arm is right yeah yeah yeah i really do not know where it will be and because last time as you remember i promised
SPEAKER_00: had covid when i pulled john one of those rounds again i heard like a little bit click click click here you know and and so i i need to be uh careful no i'm not gonna pull john um one guy is saying angry versus john but um yeah yeah but but but i i would i mean i mean i would i would at least kick your ass for sure oh so you oh
SPEAKER_03: Oh, everyone, everyone wants to kick my ass. That's what I'm here. But nobody, nobody, not everyone wants to kick your ass. No, everyone, like I received so many messages of people asking about matches, but just, just because you're in New Jersey and that, that would be like, John Brzen calls me and says like, you want to pull, if you ever like literally for real come out of retirement, I'll, I'll be your match. I'll be your match. We'll, we'll, we'll, whatever, whatever. And then, and then you will send me back to reality that, you know, I'm a husband, right?
SPEAKER_00: that would be really good yeah i could do that that would be really good if i could do that yeah i would imagine if i'm standing next to you like on the table you would just see red and i would not wear red because you would try to kill me no yeah listen listen you are you are such a nice person that i i don't think that i would ever be like that
SPEAKER_00: angry and like, you know, like, I don't know. I don't know. Like you are, you are friends, friends, understand? Like, yeah, but, but I don't know. I don't know if I can reach to that level anytime soon or not. I really do not know where I am. I really don't know where I am. I really don't know. If I would pull you right now, I really don't know. I really don't know. In the long term, I would trust myself if everything goes well.
SPEAKER_03: In the short term, I really don't know. Hey, I'm a fan of armwrestling. I really want to see Engin Terzi get back on the armwrestling table, especially because you're the one who's doing all these crazy matches and you're not part of them. You know, so give me a call. Neil's already in the chat. Neil's like, let's go. Let's go. Remember Babyface? He got you.
SPEAKER_00: Giga chat. I don't know what it is. Paul Italia Cigar says that Ibiza is super shit, but I read it. Engin, will you get Devon a B haircut in Turkey? Thank you very much, my friend. I think I read this before as well. Yeah, Engin Terzi versus Neil Pickup. Engin Terzi versus Gachevski. That would be good, you know. That would be good, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: and how is looking better and better i was is looking like like i i it's insane it's absolutely insane i'm always amazed i'm like and he gets in these wars and everything yes he's 53 years old
SPEAKER_00: He's, you know, I think he doesn't get as much credit as he deserves. I mean, listen, he gets all the credit from the people who knows armwrestling, but not from the people that, you know, who thinks that, you know, like who are the most popular on social media are the best armwrestlers or something, you know. I mean, Gajewski is easily, easily, I can say top five or top seven ever.
SPEAKER_00: But whenever, if I write, here is my top five or top 10, they are like, oh, Engin doesn't know what he's talking about. No, Engin knows what he's talking about. You don't know what you are talking about. You know, just that, you don't, you don't know, you don't know what he was doing 25 years ago. You have no idea. You have no idea about him. And you have no idea about prime Cobra. You have no idea about Dave Patton. You have no idea about prime arts and media, like, like
SPEAKER_00: 2007 Arsene Lille who won Zloty Tour, 78 kilo. Oh, I mean, I don't think that there has been any human being at 78 kg that would beat that Arsene. But just my opinion. And I'm telling you, our messaging today is higher level because as I say always, more people are doing. But if you are talking about like the really very best, I cannot say that today's very best
SPEAKER_00: would beat uh the very best of some other years you know i cannot say but about super heavy weight arm wrestling has never been as tough as today same with 105 kg just look at there exactly on garber total things jumbo zinc prudnik you know just like many other robbies there you know like i mean it is incredible but super heavy weights by far there has not been any time
SPEAKER_00: close to this competition level. Of course, there was a guy, you know, Alan Carrere, but who was close? Vakhtanya Vahadze was there, John Brzee was there, the three guys. You go and go 80s, and then you talk Richard Lapkus, Gary Goodrich, John Brzee, yeah, okay. Today, I can count you
SPEAKER_00: We don't even, we cannot even decide. We couldn't decide for some time who is number two for many months here, you know? Yes. But even now, you know, we don't know. There is Zaur, Vitaly comes at his best. We don't know. We don't know. And by the way, do you think that Morozo, do you follow him, how big he is getting, how, what he's lifting and things like that? Do you think there is any, any, Revan is my guest.
SPEAKER_00: I asked Revas, I said, Revas, after your match, three months later or four months later, Morozov told me that he is now 25% stronger and he will be even stronger till July when he's going to pull end of July Levant. And he said, if that is the case, there is a chance that he can beat
SPEAKER_00: Levani said he has more chance than Levani against him if what he's saying is true, if that improvement really happened. Of course, he didn't say his opinion about if Morozov can improve as much as he thinks he is improving. Morozov surprised everyone because he showed up and his left was his main arm and he was pretty dominant with it and there's a reason why he's the rank number one.
SPEAKER_03: But his right arm somehow catched up, got better after he lost a pretty, got better. Like I didn't pick him, you know, to win him against Dave Chafee. He did it. And I just see more and more improvement. And he took some time off. So he's definitely all healed up.
SPEAKER_00: hundred and ten percent and i think it's a match i think it's yes yes i agree with you the guy pulled like nine months four stripper matches also one left arm matches he was just destroyed you know the guy was exhausted yeah and now he has eight months eight months yeah or nine months even from november to the seventh month yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: I think we can expect anything. We already saw that Superman can bleed. We already saw Hermes kind of showed the way. And let's see what he has in it for, you know, I think it's awesome. I think it's absolutely awesome. And I think for Levin, it's even better. Challenge. He has a challenge, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Because before the thing that happened in King of the Table, it was boring. It was pretty boring. We were looking at him like this is where Levan ranks and this is where everyone else ranks. You know, all this free space. I'm excited. I think it's an awesome match. Yeah, me too. I also want to explain something to the community. I always play the devil's advocate. If one guy looks underdog on the paper,
SPEAKER_00: I try to make like the possibilities, you know, like bring the possibilities of how the other guy would beat him. Like Levan is my good friend, the same as Morozov. I really don't care who is winning there, but I'm hoping it to be a good match. And that is why if Devon is pulling Levan, I would talk about, I would focus on the way that how Devon could beat Levan.
SPEAKER_00: Because Devon would be underdog. So Gennady looks a little bit underdog against Devon. So that is why I say like, what if Gennady does this? So some people are just, whenever I talk like this, they are automatically coming with a prejudiced mind. They are like, oh, you hate this guy. You hate that guy. You know, please guys, you know, that's not my intention. All of these...
SPEAKER_03: I think we are too old. We are too old that we give opinions and people think it's hate. You know, when you give opinion, it's like if there's two guys and you say, I think this guy is going to win. You don't hate this guy. You know, you just said it because... I don't even say that this guy wins. I never give prediction. I never give prediction. I only say that what if there is a possibility if he does this. Like if Devin goes like this and if Gennady starts eating...
SPEAKER_00: forward, you know, and they are like, Oh, you hate, you hate that one. And you hate so much, you know, like I am there when we talk all the time, like we left, we are friends, you know, we are like same with Gennady. The only problem is we cannot communicate. We need translators or he needs to go and translate to, we cannot have direct communication. So whatever, you know, anyways, people say that it would be too much for me. Yeah. This is what they are saying.
