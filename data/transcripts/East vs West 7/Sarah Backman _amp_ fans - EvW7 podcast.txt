SPEAKER_04: is there is a reason that she's a legendary absolutely absolutely yeah so my name is amarudo spirulari i was born in albania my family immigrated to the u.s in 99
SPEAKER_04: I currently live in Virginia and practicing as a as a doctor, a chiropractor to be exact for three years now. And
SPEAKER_04: Like, are you armwrestler? Anything or just fed? Well, the first ever armwrestling practice I went to was Ron Bath's house. And I went to Ron Bath's house, did a practice. And then I was in so much pain for so long that I just kind of I stopped pulling. And but I was watching it all the time. I went to a couple of WAL events in Atlanta.
SPEAKER_04: I was, if you ever watch the video with Devin and Michael Todd pulling, I'm like in the very front with a green shirt on cheering, you know? So a lot of people have seen me on that video, but I pull occasionally, you know, it interferes with my work because the elbow pain and the other pain that I get. So it's tough to fully commit, but I like to, you know, when I get the itch, I scratch it. Okay, got it.
SPEAKER_02: how is the recovery recovery is really good i'm eight weeks post surgery now and i'm doing my rehab twice a day and i just came from the doctor this morning and i can start training again in july i thought it would be sooner than that
SPEAKER_02: but that's how far out it's gonna be because it's like this this side is way worse than the right side he said um my tendons were completely shattered uh so he had to it's gonna be a little more difficult healing process so a little bit more time okay when he said that left is watered in the right side talking about the old
SPEAKER_03: injury or there is something new yeah yeah so no it's the the injury i had on my right side three years ago against gaffey yeah but you are okay now right oh yeah i'm great yes okay okay yeah whenever you said that it's more than the right side i was like what happened against the right side yeah yeah i know we're all good all good storm yeah that's good that's good and how about your right arm
SPEAKER_02: Right arm is great. I train it every day. I'm feeling really strong. All my guys say that I feel stronger than ever. So I'm just waiting for my, I have a match against Heidi Cordner in August. So that's my next scheduled like event. Are you interested to pull overseas? I am. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: and you know different organization different title yeah but are you ready to challenge your borders or you know what i mean like you want to do something that would be written down history or you want to start you know
SPEAKER_02: like you want to go direct title for direct title or yeah okay i don't know if i'm gabby ready like i think i'm stronger now than a year ago so like maybe but i would like to pull somebody so if you have somebody in mind you know uh you tell me if there's anything you would want to see but are you ready to pull
SPEAKER_03: know because you pulled gabby maybe a little bit more time and are you ready to pull anyone who weighs as much as you do yes within three months yes yeah okay yeah yeah of course of course yeah you are gonna pull only when you say that you are ready you understand yeah these these things you know i know you have been suffering with
SPEAKER_03: so many injuries and everything i understand if you ask me i cannot tell you when i can i probably i have maybe a little bit closer case because older and you know yeah but i understand that you know you need to be these kind of matches cannot be uh how's they hurry do you understand it needs to be done whenever it is the perfect time you know for both athletes is what i would do
SPEAKER_02: yeah i still can't hold the peg with my left arm like so i i when i arm wrestle now i pull with my right and then my my left side is my left arm is just hanging down so i can't really pull 100 yet even though i feel good i feel strong but i need that extra support from holding the peg you know and i can do that in about three months so i think i think that you should you should come to east versus west
SPEAKER_03: Of course, if you are good enough to win the qualifications in U.S. October, I think that's the right time. If you have another event in August, then I think after August, then October, I think as long as you are not re-injured in anything, I think that's the best time. Guys, what do you guys think about Sarah Beckman?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I'm a great, great fan of hers for the last, I guess, 10, 12 years or so. And I have a question for you, Sarah. And I really wanted to ask you ever since your first match with Gabby, no, not first match, the first super match that you had with Gabby at WL. So at a very young age, you started completely dominating and annihilating everybody that came your way. So many championships after that, and then you suffer an injury and then you go with a cast on your head.
SPEAKER_01: and win the world championships with left i just don't understand what sort of mentality or you know strength mental strength it takes like what gets you motivated after having won so much
SPEAKER_02: with an injury being beaten up and still you go ahead and train for the championships like how do you do that how do you get motivated stay motivated yeah i mean first of all thank you so much that is so sweet of you um i've always been obsessed of arm wrestling uh sometimes more than other times you know i go through faces where i'm like completely obsessed and it's all i want and
SPEAKER_02: Usually you can see my social media when it's like I'm on fire and then there's periods of time where I don't feel as much for it. But at the time where I pulled Gabby at WAL, I was also going through a divorce. And I don't know if you've ever gone through a divorce, but it's kind of rough mentally and life changes. And I just needed to find myself again. So I booked a ticket to Poland to pull at Zloty Tour.
SPEAKER_02: with the cast or with a sling. And I just wanted to do something for me. So the obsession came back along with my divorce. And that's like my reason why I went injured. I just needed to get away from where I was currently at. I think from now, you are not going to do things without being 100% sure, because that is
SPEAKER_03: your reputation as an athlete. So I think from now on, you will be competing only when you think that you are totally ready. Yeah. Correct. And before I'm going to ask you something, I will ask if you would go back in time to Dubai, would you change anything the way that you pulled from the beginning?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I would not go inside with her. I would try harder, faster to go on her fingers. Yeah, back. Yeah. Right from the beginning, right? Right from the beginning. Right from the beginning. But the thing is, I know that I'm strong inside. It's just she was stronger. You know what you were doing? You were kind of like jumping in front of a truck that is going 100 miles an hour, you know? Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: yeah whenever you just go there and then i was like you know of course you are my friend and she is my friend too and then i was like why is she still doing the same exact thing you know yeah and then round four and then that round alone was also paper with that that the long long long match you know you're you're you top roll her
SPEAKER_03: But she still was very strong. The arm wasn't really moving so much yet. But do you think that if you did that right from the beginning, do you think that the result may be different? Because the reason I'm asking, because even though you toppled her, it didn't seem like you were going anywhere either. That's why you get the fouls. You hit and your elbow was jumping. And do you think that
SPEAKER_03: you would be exhausted or she would be exhausted in later rounds if the round four was round one later rounds who would be exhausted yeah
SPEAKER_02: yeah no i i definitely think if i had put more pressure back in the beginning the the outcome could have been different because i know i have better endurance than her um it's how i train i train for hours and hours and i have done that for a long time and i usually don't get tired quickly um that's my that's one of my strengths so it's definitely possible the outcome could have been different
SPEAKER_03: yeah but you don't mention this because once you without somebody is asking you you mentioned this it will sound like excuse and this and that but because since i asked you so you generally uh answered yeah i'm a little sorry about it yeah um well i real quick i wanted to ask what you had done to the shoulder and then my main question was what you thought about gabby and uh barbara's match
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so yeah, first my shoulder, I tore my subscapularis. And subscapularis is the rotator cuff that does the side pressure.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Yeah. You know, you're, you're a doctor. So, you know, yeah. So like any type of side pressure is like what I can't do. And I had the exact same injury on my right arm. So it's like bad luck or something, you know, hard training in the rotator cuff or anything. It was, it was just kind of, kind of. Yeah. And the bicep tendon was also two inches out of its groove. Oh yeah. Yeah. So they had to put that back.
SPEAKER_02: And, oh my God, I was on fire for their match, Barbara and Gabby. Like, it was so cool to see somebody that young, you know, Barbara, I've been following her for years as well, and very, like, super strong. I always knew this, and I actually thought that she could, if there's anybody that could beat Gabby, it would be her. So I was very excited for that match.
SPEAKER_02: um super proud of both of them they showed extreme skill um and the sportmanship like you're proud to be one of them you know when you see that type of match so great job for both of them yeah um when like there is a understanding which i disagree you know not with whole community but some people when two incredible athletes meet each other when one loses
SPEAKER_03: They bring the other guy down. No, if they are here, the other one just goes up. He doesn't go down. They both are great killers. Like for Gabi to lose against Barbora, I mean, not even a bit would take anything away from her. You could lose against Gabi, nothing even a bit takes from you, you know? Especially when I make those trading cards also, I remember this.
SPEAKER_03: And people are saying, oh, these guys are all like seven and a half, eight, nine, you know. Come on, you know. Come on, man. Welcome to the Champions League, you know. What do you expect, you know? I mean, what do you expect from Sasha Andrew? What do you expect from Rustam Baba? You expect like five and six or something? What do you expect? I mean, there is nothing better than this. So this is what I wanted to also mention. There is a super set. There is a super set.
SPEAKER_02: Aydan Walter. Hello, Engin. I know you and Sara. I wanted to ask her what advice she would give to newer pullers like me. Okay, that's it? Yeah. Okay. Definitely, you have to genuinely love the sport, I believe. You have to genuinely love anything to become great at it.
SPEAKER_02: Definitely fall in love with it and be passionate. I keep saying that you have to have some type of obsession for it and to be really good. I would also advise to have table time at least once a week.
SPEAKER_02: I keep saying to people too, like people that only train in the gym, for example, like you can't become a good guitar player by playing piano. Like you got to arm wrestle to be good at arm wrestling. So at least once a week, I think table time is important. And then train your wrists, do a lot of pull-ups. I think that's a great basic exercise. Rope climbs for the general strength for the upper body, grip strength as well.
SPEAKER_02: and then you can go into more specifics um as you advance but as a like beginner definitely general upper body strength is very necessary yep yep I agree I agree with Michelle okay
SPEAKER_01: I want to say something like when we're talking about cards, and internet is like flooded with all sorts of comments and people don't always think too much before writing anything. But regarding the cards, even though like people like Sasho Andre and Rustam Babayan, they're at the real talk. But still, I noticed something which was very analytically, I work in finance and data analytics. So that stuck out to me.
SPEAKER_01: Someone like John Brzenk, who is like the best that's ever going to be. If you really look closely, let's say out of 100, he's coming out to 95, 94.5. And someone, even in your own mind, let's say Rustam Babayev or Sasho Andrei, who is amazing, but not John Brzenk.
SPEAKER_01: You'll find places where they are below them. So nobody at all on that entire list is inappropriately placed. Everybody is exactly where they should be. I don't understand what you're saying exactly. So you are saying John is here and then I make other guys about John or what do you think? No, no, no. I'm saying that. Yeah. So John is at the very top.
SPEAKER_01: Right. And the other guys, although they are amazing, they're the very best and they have to be eight, nine, ten on all of them. But there is still below John. That is just one example. Not just John. Even if you take another players, when we look at the accuracy, the numbers have been placed amazingly well. They're exactly appropriate for that person.
SPEAKER_01: So sometimes people might say, but Jerry is amazing. He has beaten John. He has amazing record. But overall on table versatility, he comes a little bit below John and you'll find him. Yeah, Jerry is below John. Gennady is below, let's say some other puller. So although the placing of the numbers are very 89, 90, 92, 93 out of 100, they're all exactly where they're supposed to be. So I just wanted to commend you on how accurately the ratings were given. It was very nicely done. Yeah, but people need to understand something.
SPEAKER_03: Like somebody may not be so explosive. Somebody may not be like only like just say Cobra Rose. He was all about top role. If you want, if I would rank his hook, if I would rank his something else, you know, may not be so high, but if that guy is very, very good about something that very like he points, you understand his total number, maybe lower, you understand? So it doesn't determine that, you know, like he, all of his,
SPEAKER_03: things you know like he may not have super hand control but he would just hold you like boom like for example rest in peace like push cut i don't think the beginning he has an incredible grip and going up but i didn't see him like you know you know like yeah you understand i didn't see him super hand control he just didn't need it he just squeezed your thumb and boom smashed the pin pad you know he didn't so so many times he didn't need
SPEAKER_03: uh endurance so people just looks at the the cars okay they look at the all of them and they think that the one who has the and also remember you know this is from one event to other event the things may change people may not be in same form people are improving people may be a little bit injured you know like a lot of a lot of things this is something general like not to be taken super serious and also
SPEAKER_03: Just my opinion, you know, just those cards. Sarah, you want to have your cards as well in October? Yes. I mean, that's super cool. That's like a childhood dream, you know? You will have to sign a lot of cards. Very cool. Yeah. One hour. You need to spend one hour signing stuff. Deal. Deal. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Amarillo.
SPEAKER_04: My friend, what are you exactly? You're a doctor or you are a physiotherapist? I got my doctorate in chiropractic. So I'm a chiropractor is what my title is. So that involves physiotherapy, musculoskeletal work. I don't prescribe medication. I don't perform any surgery. But everything else. That is what we need. The surgery needs to be the last thing. That's what I'm saying. It's the last resort. I'm trying to keep people away from surgery if I can. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: we need we need like since you are an arm wrestling fan you are i mean probably like so curious about our type of injuries and do you have do you have any uh information knowledge to share with us like your own own uh opinions you know based off of of of what i've learned being in in the arm wrestling community
SPEAKER_04: is how important it is to work the opposite muscles so arm wrestling is all this back pressure you know pulling stuff all that stuff so much chest involved so
SPEAKER_04: Anytime I pull, you know, I always try to do the opposite after the workout to try and to try and get the muscles involved that weren't involved during the practice right so a lot of internal rotation, you know, I'll work external rotation I'll take a band and just work outside going out this way, going out this way, whatever, this kind of stuff with with a forearm, everybody you know wants to work the, the
SPEAKER_04: curling the wrist this way, but they don't put any attention on doing this type of work, the opposite way, you know, because it takes a lot of pressure off the elbow once you do that. If you're just stuck doing the same thing all the time, your muscles are going to overcompensate and you're going to get injuries. Eventually, you're going to get pain. No balance. You want to balance. You got to have the balance. Exactly. You know, that's why I love it. Trust me, whenever you do these kind of things, I will also share my experience.
SPEAKER_03: to train the opposite way. I think that you really need to be careful as well. It may also affect your performance. I wouldn't suggest to newcomers to do that a lot. But after a point, that after they build what they need, then it's good that they can balance. And I wouldn't suggest anyone to do the opposite way right after the training. I would just train, train,
SPEAKER_03: Make sure that those muscles are shaped as I train. Maybe next day or something, I can do the opposite way.
SPEAKER_04: I train them to really shape. I don't want to do everything opposite way right away. You know what I mean? And that's why I love the Latvians, man. The Latvians got it right. Coach Ray, Giannis, those guys, they know exactly what they're doing. It's just like, I see those guys and they got full extension in their elbow still. And I mean, they got it all, you know? So they're doing it right. Just trust me. Being healthy is very important. But...
SPEAKER_03: um yeah like for me yes i have so many injuries but there is a reason for this i i had to really force myself that much just just because i wanted to be healthy like i couldn't sacrifice some of those those tight tendons and everything of course when you are not flexible you get broken but that is also a price that i had to pay yeah forget about me let's go with cara again
SPEAKER_02: Sarah, have you been following East versus West? Of course. Oh yeah. Every, every time. Yes. Hardcore fan. You enjoy, you enjoy. Oh my God. Yes. It's like the highlight of the month. You know, it's what I look for. It's even like, we have a big calendar in the kitchen and when it's the East versus West, it's, it's on the board there, like on a Saturday or whatever it is, you know? You get happy, you get happy that it's coming soon? So happy. So happy. That's good. That's good. Yeah. I see. I see that.
SPEAKER_03: you support uh support i see i see whenever i share something i see that you always uh put a like and yeah yeah i see that you always show your support yeah and you will be you will be good and what what do you think about what what what would you criticize and what what could you say in positive way like minuses and pluses because i need to hear those those
SPEAKER_02: minuses in in respectful way as well too so i can improve you to be honest with you engine like me and my husband we watch it every time and we're always like it always gets better we're so amazed with the production like it feels like you have taken
SPEAKER_02: 20 years of arm wrestling shows and perfected it. It's perfect. The angles, the sound, the commentating, everything is great.
SPEAKER_03: I don't even have anything bad to say. I think it's a great variety of matches. I mean, of course I would like to see a little bit more women, but I understand too, it's hard to get women involved and on a high caliber. I need to, I need to, I need to do this. That's why I did the qualification. I will give you more. Yeah. I will do more. Remember a while ago when the guy asked you on a super chat, what advice, I mean, you talk about being passionate, obsession, you know, and then when you are talking, I, I smiled that there was a reason.
SPEAKER_03: because I think I represented the passion and the obsession that that is sort of why it is getting better because I love doing this. I love doing this, yeah. And whenever, I mean, Sara, you know that we never receive the attention that we deserve all those years. Yeah, so it is kind of hurting me
SPEAKER_03: to see such a beautiful sport and its superstars are ignored. Now, somehow I had an opportunity
SPEAKER_02: i'm like i'm gonna kill it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you you're doing so good like i'm so proud of everything you have done and like it's so fun for arm wrestling like it's you have really taken it to the next level so couldn't be more thankful for you really yeah i also thank you for your support and hopefully hopefully
SPEAKER_03: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Plus a few days, you know just like the it kind of discourages me to see unnecessary dramas that you know just people are putting, but I will I hear from people that cool. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Like who really loves the sport positive things, and I know some people intentionally with fake accounts and troll accounts, you know, try to discourage me and still my motivation, but.
SPEAKER_03: As long as I hear these kind of things, there's no way that they're going to
SPEAKER_02: like feel my motivation there's always going to be haters out there and like you said troll accounts like i've dealt with that for years people say that i look like a man and you know like it it hurt me in the beginning but now i'm just like like it doesn't even touch me anymore so i hope you get to that point too where you don't care because it's it really doesn't matter what they say you have a huge fan base that supports you are from sweden you are from sweden i'm from
SPEAKER_03: and my nickname is Angry Turk, so it's hard for me to come to your point. And guys, do you guys have anything to add? And the same question to you guys, like what would you suggest me to do to better the event?
SPEAKER_04: It seems like any sort of change that had to be made, you made it. In the beginning, there was issues with the internet. You took care of the internet. There was issues with replay. I think you took care of the replay. Like Sarah said, it's hard to critique anything. Everything seems so good. I mean, if there's one thing, if I had to critique something, it would just be maybe make it a two-day event because the event can be so long sometimes. But that's why it's 11 mattress now. Oh, it's 11 mattress now?
SPEAKER_03: yeah 11 matches yeah so it will be around not that long but about four hours but come on yeah i think four hours every three months is good you know anything you will be like oh did it finish but six hours as you said like you don't have any more adrenaline you know like like because everything is so exciting johnny's pulling here actually this guy is pulling that guy and then you are like you know you have no more power to even react you know everything you are just like
SPEAKER_01: know it's like you over eat you know things you know and then you you can't eat anymore yeah you know what on amarillo's point like i understand the business perspective of it like shorten it four hours but to be very honest again even after the event is done it's like 3am in india or even after that and then we get on call with our arm wrestling friends who are discussing right on the spot oh my god this has happened and then like the last time barbara's match so history it was com like
SPEAKER_01: Nobody was believing that could happen. History was created. And then I have friends in the Slovakian team who were training with Barbora. So after I had discussion with my Indian friends, we got on call there. Oh, my God, this has happened. So the four hour event is actually six hours for us. And we are really grateful for that.
SPEAKER_03: we if even after watching all that you still have time to continue discussing about see i love that see like whenever i hear this it helps my motivation that you guys are they're passionate because there is something i find common you know with what i feel what stata feels what you feel what amarillo feels it's beautiful but imagine that you know whenever i was organizing so many matches a lot of people i'm not going to mention they told me and you need to do
SPEAKER_03: only these matches and you know paid only for these guys and and i'm like you know there are a lot of superstars that you don't know about them and there are masters they deserve to be here you need to get to know them they disagree now you talk about barbara right who how many people was talking about morozo want to help you yeah so this is we need to give those people chances
SPEAKER_03: And we need to also provide opportunities so they can show themselves. We need to create a dream for them that they can, if I'm good enough. But they didn't have that. Many people wrote to me, I cannot count what to do. So this is why we have qualifications. And I just want to inform that there is no need to come with qualifications to come to these resources.
SPEAKER_03: He just chooses to come. Sarah Beckman, anytime she's ready, she knows that she has the supremacy. Right, Sarah? You know. I appreciate that. But you know that. You know that there's some people like Gabriela doesn't need. In fact, Egle doesn't need. Like if Irina Makeo wanted to come back, she doesn't need. The other day, somebody I'm not going to mention said that
SPEAKER_03: I think Barbara asked her to ask more something if she needed to compete the European qualification. I told that person to tell, you know, I don't know if it's true or not, but I said, she is the champion. She has the title. What kind of qualification she would need, you know, to compete, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Since we're talking about Barbora's match, one question to you. At that time, you were the organizer, and it wouldn't have been right to ask because you were organizing the match. But in your very honest opinion, and this goes to you too, Sarah, did you really see the match going that way? Did you really see? And in what percentage did you see Barbora winning or winning that way, like fatiguing Gabby's hand and then just going through her hand?
SPEAKER_02: were you expecting that and what was your like really prediction in your heart I thought beforehand that Barbara could beat Gabby based on her height she's like twice the size of Gabby like her arm is a lot longer and she's a multiple world champion in the heavyweight in the heavier weight class than Gabby you know so I saw it coming
SPEAKER_03: I did. What about you, Engin? Were you also very confident that Barbara would make history? I would not organize a match if I didn't think that one guy or one girl doesn't have a chance. I wouldn't organize that match. I mean, I would think that one is favored, but I would still think that maybe the other guy or girl would cause problems. But about this,
SPEAKER_03: I really didn't know how the match. And after I saw the first two rounds, I was like, wow, what a domination. And then suddenly everything changed. You know, I would never, ever expect. But there are many matches that happen. And this is the beauty of arm wrestling. When I said Dave Chaffee versus Morozov, it was like 90% Dave Chaffee on the post.
SPEAKER_03: But Morozov, so we need this kind of surprise as well. I'm not talking about they need to lose to be surprised, but we set the matches, even like if you see out of 15 matches, if you see three, four surprises, it just chucks the world. That's why we are in this life. If everything is going to go as expected, that would be such a boring, boring, boring life. That's my opinion. On that note, as Sarah mentioned, as Ameldo mentioned,
SPEAKER_01: it beats imagination what you're doing with East versus West. It is the perfect thing that a fan from an entertainment perspective can imagine, even those who are not arm wrestlers. But just not even a suggestion, I'm asking you, would you think if that would be okay? When John's match was going with Petrenko, later on some other people's videos in True Power's channels, we saw the camera panning out and the energy was so high in the room. People were shouting out. It was amazing to witness that.
SPEAKER_03: so keeping that in mind if the matches were held maybe kind of like wal or maybe in a different way where the fans that was one of the reasons that i asked a question we need two things missing the music yeah and and the crowd around we need we need to we need to that that needs to be next two steps and
SPEAKER_03: the music I want to use some high quality music, but not with copyright issues, because I'm going to put the videos on YouTube. And or I need to, I don't know how to still I couldn't figure out, I need to really pay money and get the right to use the music, you know, something very good, it can be even some expensive, as long as it's gonna be good enough for the community, you understand, it's gonna add something.
SPEAKER_04: i'm not cheap we can do this yeah but we will see and amarillo you are quiet my friend you are quite you are you you have any questions for sarah or anything you want to say whatever you want to say yeah no i was going to put my input on on gabby and uh barbara's match yeah so once i saw gabby and sarah pool and i saw that that sarah was able to fatigue gabby's hand in those later rounds once i saw barbara get that first win
SPEAKER_04: I was almost certain in my head that Gabby was going to have a very hard time getting another win. So I saw Barbara winning that match as soon as she got the first one. And to be honest with you, before the match happened,
SPEAKER_04: maybe I'm, I was a little bit stupid in thinking this, but I thought, I thought Barbara was just too big, too strong, you know, too much leverage and everything. And she was going to give Gabby a real hard time. And then Gabby just, you know, smoked her the first two rounds. I was like, okay, nevermind. But then like, like I said, she got that. She finally was able to stop Gabby fatigue her hand. And then after that, I was like, ah, it doesn't look, it doesn't look good for Gabby at this point. And you know, Barbara was able to, to come out on top there, but
SPEAKER_04: mean amazing match and and you talked about dave and motors off and that and and and i have to be honest when you put that match together i was like how you know how does this match make sense i mean prudnik just smoked motors off you know and
SPEAKER_04: People grow. Absolutely, absolutely. And then I questioned you again when you made Bojadar and Adam Morzynski. I was like, Adam has never pulled on international stage and Bojadar many, many time world champ. I was like, there's no way. And then boom, we see it. And he just, he was basically playing with Bojadar. I was like, oh my gosh. He played, but he had the full control. I didn't need to take that kind of risk.
SPEAKER_03: so that we can see something shocking, new stars. I don't know either. I don't know. Maybe Bozidar was going to beat him, but I look at it. I see the possibility. I said, let me do it. And then whatever happens, happens. I cannot know everything, but how are we going to know? I said, Adam Wozniacki versus the new guy, Bacho. I don't know either. Maybe Adam is going to kill him. Maybe Bacho is going to surprise us, 18 years old kid.
SPEAKER_03: Back to our superstar, Sara. So Sara, you said that your friends or teammates are telling you that your performance or your shape right now is better than ever, you said, or as good as ever? Yeah, I mean, you know, the guys I've been training with for years, but like most of the time I'm stronger than all of them.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah right males correct um and I just know based on what I'm training like the weights I'm training in the gym too um I feel just strong I I don't do any like before all my life I've done like bodybuilding powerlifting arm wrestling but now for two three years I've trained only arm wrestling
SPEAKER_02: only i only train arm wrestling stuff now i don't care about body so much anymore and i i don't care about how much how i look and stuff i just want to be strong here and that's what i train every day so it's a little bit different a little yeah a little different start i mean like looking good is i know it is i mean probably good feeling but
SPEAKER_03: that satisfaction of that being the best, that satisfaction of the war, you know, it is not only because of that winning, but it is because of like, I don't know how to say, you are like on a battlefield, that kind of adrenaline, that kind of, I don't know, I think that's something that you really want to feel it, you need it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: that's probably why you choose more of arm wrestling yeah and i feel more mature too like before you know i i cared very much how i looked and stuff and you can see it on my social media too like it's not as much focused on the look and i've lost a lot of fans because a lot of fans just care about
SPEAKER_03: fit body and you know and i it's not about that anymore for me it's i want to be the strongest so you are you are saying that you are gonna be who you want to be not what people want you to be yes so you you want to be what you choose to be okay that that's that's the e for happiness 400 percent
SPEAKER_04: yes once you try to be as people want you to be at some shape you know then then trust me it's just no good what's that i was going to ask sarah who do you who do you get a chance to train with in florida are you training with like artem and chance and you know some of some of these bigger guys or usually try very
SPEAKER_02: I mean, very rarely, maybe once a year I train with them. They live three hours away and they have their own teams and stuff. I train with Brad Grundy sometimes. Don't tell me that you're meeting that guy. No, no, no, no, no, absolutely not. But like he comes to my gym once in a while and that's always a pleasure.
SPEAKER_03: i'm i'm i'm i'm a male puller i don't think i can beat him at least now the guy is very very strong the guy is powerful there is a super chat in that qualifier and stilky milky said that you can hire talk hushings to write and produce interrupt
SPEAKER_03: introduction music for atlas he's funny yeah he's good about it yeah he's really good yeah he and his girlfriend remember the tazila song yeah thank you for your super chat and there is another one my friend sean crowther my friend thank you for your super chat for what it will add
SPEAKER_03: i don't think it would be worth paying royalties to use music for entrance songs when you release the videos on youtube you could just have the audio muted during the enter entrances i understand thank you for your super chat and suggestion silky will another one what is most important pressure in rates maximum pressure resistance over a
SPEAKER_04: short periods or consistent pressure over the length of a match. I don't know if you understand. Does anybody follow the chat? Yeah, I think you're asking is it better to just have a lot of raw horsepower or is it better to be able to hold, I guess, have more endurance, it seems like the question. What matters more? What's more important? Short bursts or one long match. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: i guess i would depend on the person you know you got fast twitch muscle fibers you got slow twitch muscle fibers you know so i think that's part of what what's your opinion yeah i think if if you ha if you are lucky to be born with the fast twitch muscle fiber and you can hit from the go fast and hard i think that's better than to catch and hold if i understand it correctly like to i understood it yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: maybe instead of explaining um like can you directly read the the the super chat maybe he would understand uh yeah uh let's see if i can find it i think that's better than to caption
SPEAKER_04: It was the last one. What is the most important feature in the wrist? Maximum pressure resistance over a short period or consistent pressure over the length of a match? Okay. Is this the same thing you understood before or something different? I understand it differently now. I think the wrist control pressure is...
SPEAKER_02: yeah i think the risk pressure needs to be constant always if you lose the wrist at any point you you will be in a bad position most likely you know so you have to be strong during the whole steady pressure throughout the match it's more important yeah yeah anyway so
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's talk a little bit about the matches. Do you follow these guys or some of them you will not know, Sarah? Like East versus West? Yeah. I watch them all, but the thing is I tend to be more interested in matches if I know them personally. Okay. What we will do, I will start asking the ones that you have
SPEAKER_03: opinion you say that okay i will and the ones that you're not familiar so much you can say that you know okay you don't have and then i can only ask to our uh fan guests okay let's start with like
SPEAKER_02: I'm sure you know Zurab because this will be the sixth time Zurab is coming. Plus, Rob is a personal friend. I love him and his family. I can't wait. Yes. It will be very exciting. That's not what I asked. I think Rob, if he's in his right mind, can take him. I believe in Rob. How does he take him?
SPEAKER_03: side pressure hook top roll him how do you think that i don't know you don't know no okay okay but just remember the ones that you are familiar i will ask details okay okay guys and shortly let me also have your prediction
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, so like Sarah said, and I think a lot of us know that if Rob Vigent is serious, he's committed, he's a really bad dude. So if that's the case, I see Rob taking Zurab's hand and probably finishing with a press like he likes to. If not, I think Zurab will just turn him right in and it'll be bicep on bicep. Then I have a hard time
SPEAKER_04: kind of seeing Rob being able to compete with Zurab's inside pressure, and I think Zurab would probably pin him fairly comfortably. So that's my opinion. Yeah, you said the possibilities, but how about the prediction? My prediction? I like Rob. I've always liked Rob. I'm going to say Rob 3-1. 3-1. And you?
SPEAKER_01: I have a very similar prediction to Amarillo. I think Rob takes it. Because he's been showing up nowadays, like on the podcast, we can see he's motivated, he's training. And when Rob's training, he is a bad dude. And the newer fans, they just don't know because he's been quiet in the last three years. But he has a long history. You pick out names, he has beaten them all. So he has pedigree. But I do think that Rob, if he's working on his strap game a little bit more,
SPEAKER_01: Because if he takes the lane that Chance took against Zurab and is able to lock that in, I think it's going to be a good pin for Zurab, for Rob. 3-0. But just because he's rusty and he's coming back after a long time, also he's in the habit of catching people. So if it takes some time to understand which lane Zurab is taking, maybe the first one could go to Zurab. But I think Rob is going to take it. And I'm really rooting for him. I understand. And do you know Doc Irish?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Florida. Yeah. Who was it? Um, I maybe I pronounced no good. Can you pronounce a medical job? Doug Ehrlich. Doug Ehrlich. Doug Ehrlich. Oh, okay. Yeah. I don't know much about him, unfortunately. And he's, he, he's from Florida, I think. No, he's not. Um, I don't think so.
SPEAKER_03: I've never met him. I've never met him. Okay, let's talk about Prokopcik versus Douglas Amerinda.
SPEAKER_04: So Doug, Doug surprised me a lot beating Coach Ray. I was very impressed with that. I see Doug as like a bigger, maybe stronger version of Corey Miller. And we saw what happened with Daniel and Corey. Once Daniel got that stop, I feel like it's just so difficult to do anything with Daniel. So maybe Doug gets one round, but after that, I see Daniel winning pretty comfortably. So I'll say either 3-0 Daniel or 3-1 Daniel.
SPEAKER_03: And you? This is very interesting thing in the way. How was I calling it? You said H? H and S. Ishan. You can call me Ishan. Ishan. Yeah, Ishan. I forget and I was like, how about you? But I don't say your name because I look at them and I cannot pronounce it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'm so thrilled to be here. It doesn't even matter. I think this is very interesting. The way you had mentioned earlier that sometimes you have to take the risk, the way you took the risk with Adam and Bozidar. So this is one of those matches. But Taner Prokopcic, he's an outlier. He's an aberration in the world of strength. For the size that he is, the numbers that he puts up on his channel, we have seen his training.
SPEAKER_01: This match, even if Doug has a very fast hit, which he will have, and I think that Dan is going to hold him and show. He'll just let it go there and then side pressure through. If it doesn't go that way, I'll be thrilled because it'll be upset. And any time there's an upset in the arm wrestling world, we're all really happy as a fan. But I think that Dan takes it 3-0. Okay. And Sarah, do you know Adam Wojcicki? Yes. Yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: He was the young guy, Bacho Saginashvili. But did you follow Bacho anywhere or probably not? Yeah, I did. But were you asking me about the prediction with Adam? Yeah. I mean, I organized, even I have no clue. All I know, Adam, incredibly strong guy and a young guy, the Georgians are talking so highly.
SPEAKER_02: like almost they're gonna tell me he would be john bersing you know almost you know and so then like i'm like i have no clue so i'm i'm curious about what you would think yeah i i don't know the other guy i just know that adam has a lot of heart and that obsession we talked about earlier um i'm super proud of his accomplishments so far and i i cheer for him but i don't know the outcome yeah and how about how about
SPEAKER_03: uh alicia murado versus cody merit sarah i don't know um i really don't know about that one either you do you do you know the guy alicia murado you know that the 95 kilo kazakh guy they compete in the super heavyweight wolf and he won the wolf wars while he is 95 kilo
SPEAKER_03: And then he recently beat Petrenko with left arm after a long war, the Kazakh guy. Okay. Yeah. And he's going to pull against Cody Merritt. You know Cody Merritt? Cody Merritt, I know. Yes. But probably you don't have any idea. I don't have a prediction, no. Okay. So let me find a match that you would know. Would you know about Pauline versus Sasha? No.
SPEAKER_02: pauline and sasho okay yes yes that that would be cool i think i think um isn't paul a little bit heavier than special i mean they both will be 95 kilo the category is 95 but usually sasho is 90 92 and pauline cuts down to 95 after the weigh-in is very near 100 kilo yeah i mean paul has shown everybody recently that he he can play with
SPEAKER_02: the big names yeah so i'm excited for this match i think it's going to be a war inside a hook and will you see who's going to be stronger yeah so you are expecting a tough hook match i do yeah because you don't think that somebody can couple scotcha i personally personally i didn't see anyone
SPEAKER_03: yeah the guys beat him they have been in hook but only two guys or three guys have done that other than that i don't remember somebody is really taking his list like this i don't remember yeah yeah so you are right about it so i just wanted to say that i have the same opinion and guys if you go just by the winner or percentage prediction how would you go with alijan and cody match amarillo
SPEAKER_04: So this match is super, super interesting because I always think about how would Cody Merritt do against Petrenko? And when I think of that, I think that Cody,
SPEAKER_04: would beat Petrenko a little bit easier than Alizan would. That's what I think. But Alizan is so explosive. And if he turns Cody into a hook, I think it'll be pretty comfortable for him. But if Cody can keep his wrist, keep his hand, I think Cody wins that match. Roman, you said Irakli topples Pasha? I don't think he topples him. Pasha attack?
SPEAKER_01: he stopped him and he went straight to the pad you know yeah yeah okay yeah so um i think it's super close because i'm a huge fan of muratov uh at his weight what he's doing involved is mind-boggling and exactly what ameldo said like uh cody beat him easier cody would beat petrenko easy like a picture him beating him easier
SPEAKER_01: But the thing with Cody is that immense amount of torque that a super heavyweight can generate, he'll always be higher than Muratov on that. But if Muratov stops that, I don't think that Cody will power through Muratov's lock. And for that reason, I have him like 60-40 favorite on this. People might disagree because Cody is a super heavyweight, but Muratov, he's amazing. Yeah, I agree. Sara, there is one for your
SPEAKER_02: I should say countrymen, Tobias. And Vitaly. Yeah. I mean, that's cool. That's cool. I don't know. I hope Tobias wins. But I think Vitaly may be a little too much for him. Maybe.
SPEAKER_02: i don't know though but you know he's so he's so amazing but he's young and italy has been in you know for a while so it'll be interesting just rose um i said i am very disappointed i wouldn't expect this from you i'm joking joking they should call you teasy not hanging thursday you like
SPEAKER_03: Because, because, because I see, I see that how shy she was to predict against her countrymen. She was so shy too. And then I'm like, okay, this is a good opportunity to use, you know, you know? Yeah. He proved me wrong. You know, I really do. Um, uh, we'll see. I think the guy is young guy. I, I don't know if he can win or not, but I'm going to.
SPEAKER_03: give those guys chance i will continue to support some of the guys like future stars like it doesn't matter at least i will know his level and then his next time will be you know lower if laletin is really evolving but if somehow it is laletin then then then probably the the
SPEAKER_01: You guys in India will be talking about him next four hours. Absolutely. Absolutely. And you know what? Right now, like I have people commenting on Instagram. Oh my God, you're there. Wish we could be there. So already next discussion is starting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I want to ask Brandon, where to Samusha to Amarildo? Samusha, it's at 85, right?
SPEAKER_04: yes but yeah the only person i can see beating samusha is if if sasha went down to 85 kilos i don't see anybody else beating not not not even not even zola if he somehow goes there i mean i don't know i don't know the condition zola was in i mean we saw when when zola pulled john apparently he was dealing with a little bit of injury i don't think his inner elbow maybe or something i'm not sure if if you tell me it's the zola that pulled todd hutchings
SPEAKER_03: Yes, Zola wins. But I don't know if that's the version of him we would get. He was 91 kilo then, yeah. He was in fact 94 kilo. And there was some issues. It was like for them to come here. And so anyways, how about you? What do you think about that match?
SPEAKER_01: know yeah huge fan of both of these guys and brandon has been up and coming for the last three or four years now amazing puller but this in my opinion is an easy win for samushia and the reason i say this is when i thought about it two major reasons brandon is going to give up a lot of weight he's not an 85 kilo guy and samusha actually did you see the picture he recently shared yeah i mean he was huge
SPEAKER_03: And the guys, I don't know where the weight is going, but I can see that he was very ripped. I didn't see any side rolls. Those guys, they know how to lose weight. Like guys like Pauline, this guy, yeah, professional. Yeah. So just this thing comes to mind. Samusha is at the very, very, very top. And I thought about how a match with Greg Tullier would go for Brandon Alcester.
SPEAKER_01: And Craig is so fast, and still he just got caught in that hook every single time. So if Brandon even tries that, like explosive hit, it's not going to go well. And then Brandon has a tendency to lose his hand and then come back with a dead wrist or try to go into a flop. If Samusha takes his hand, I think that he's going to top roll him after hooking him first. But then if Brandon surprises us, it'll be amazing again. But I think it's 3-0 for Samusha.
SPEAKER_03: okay this is a good match don't tell me you don't know these guys I know them I don't want listen I don't want you to tell me it's gonna be a good match and I think it will be great and
SPEAKER_03: i don't want that i want you to tell me something technical your expectations you don't have to be right a lot of people even john bersing has been wrong so be comfortable just tell how you see the match you are one of the best female pullers i mean if you don't know who's gonna know yeah um i'm a i'm a big iraqi fan uh so
SPEAKER_02: Based on his last couple of performances, I think he's going to be one of the best ever in the sport. I think he's going to. Do it quickly and be done with it. So. I think I think. Yeah. Yeah. Majority of the people are thinking that. On their way with favorites, majority of the people.
SPEAKER_03: But even when you say, like, it's going to be quick and it's over, just tell me. Come on. You know what? It's going to be a strap match. It's going to be a strap match. You know what's the deadlift pressure? Tell me how it's going to be so quick. Okay, strap match. Yeah. I think. Side pressure. Side pressure. Maybe a little bit hooked. Like, a little bit hooked, maybe. Uh-huh. I understand. So you are
SPEAKER_03: one of the people that's thinking Iraq is favored. Yesterday, Levan Saginashvili, he's like Iraq's brother and training partner, when he said that, you know, Ongarwev is slightly favored. But who knows? Imagine that, you know, we go after the event and we remember what you were saying. Yeah, maybe. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And Amarildo? I think Ongarbaev is one of the best bowlers I've ever seen, probably never had. The way he beat Michael Todd and how calm and composed he was and relaxed, it was brilliant. I don't know. I was amazed. I have been in this sport for more than 30 years.
SPEAKER_04: i just watched like by being amazed you know just i was like wow after i saw that then i started to think in my head maybe at 105 kilos him and devin might be might actually be a good match because before that i was like probably not but now yeah so anyways to get back to this match um i i see i see on go to bible it's just it's just
SPEAKER_04: too smart and he knows how to hit his angles. He knows where he's good. So 3-1, 3-1 Ungerbaev. I think Iraq... But especially the early rounds, war, right? War. Yeah, war for sure. It's going to be a battle of the hand to see whose hand gives up first. And Ungerbaev has got so much endurance. We've seen that, you know? So... Yeah. Yeah. So I agree with Ahmed. The first round,
SPEAKER_01: If we see the first round of Ongar Bhai with John and the first round of Herakle with John, I think that Herakle wins that battle in the first round with Ongar Bhai. But Ongar Bhai is a wizard on the table. Not just with Michael Todd. With Michael Todd, what he did is mind-boggling. I can't imagine anybody who's pulling Michael for the first time adapts so quickly and then dominates. So it was amazing. But I think that he's just too smart.
SPEAKER_01: is too smart he's going to turn it around i also give it 3-1 but the first round i do believe that iraqli is going to take it iraqli is going to win the back pressure battle and the side pressure battle with uh hunger by it did you just say that dominated michael is what you said not dominated uh like how quickly he adapted
SPEAKER_03: and then once yeah I couldn't believe the way he was adapting and then hitting hitting hitting and by the time it ended I don't think that he just adopted that I think he did a very good yeah absolutely to our eyes it was like no matter how good homework you do if you are not capable of doing it if you are not smart enough to do it if you don't have like enough
SPEAKER_03: mental power to control yourself and do you realize that the guy is playing chess at the armistice table the guy alcohol means like the guy is really looks like you know he has for me incredible control over his emotions the guy is just and what's that if there's one word to describe kirigali it's it's brilliant that's that's when i was in pool that's what i think
SPEAKER_03: I cannot, I cannot do with one word. There are a lot of things, but he actually is also very strong and the guy has big dreams. And in my opinion, this is the biggest match of his life because if he wins, he will be the professional world champion. And I know that he has been living with the dream, you know. Another stripper said, is back, Silky Wilkie, thank you, my friend. Is back pressure most useful if all parts of your arm stay locked? Can you pull yourself out
SPEAKER_03: or position using back pressure but lose your bicep or wrist did you understand that or no no is back pressure most useful if all parts of the of your arm stay locked when you pull yourself out of position using back pressure
SPEAKER_03: but lose your bicep or wrist i i didn't really understand either but maybe if you would show at the table i would understand do you guys have any i know you i'm having a hard time understanding that question yeah but did you read did you meet amarillo on the chat did you read that i i tried to pull it up but i don't want to okay okay okay yeah um
SPEAKER_03: Sorry, sorry. It's probably my English. I didn't understand, but Julio Martinez, Sarah Beckman versus Irina Gladkaya. Sarah should be, I call correct, right? Sarah Oliva. Yeah, that's my married name, but in arm wrestling, I'm still being referred as Sarah Beckman. Okay. So whenever I share an announcement about you, I should do Sarah Beckman?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, OK, because I didn't know. Yeah, I didn't want this. I didn't know what to do. I could have asked. But since I saw on your profile, on your Instagram, is this Sarah Oliver or Sarah Beckman? On Instagram, it's Sarah Beckman. Oh, Sarah Beckman. OK, OK. Yeah, OK, so Sarah Beckman from now. OK.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Sarah Beckman versus Irina Golotka. You have ever pulled against her? You did, right? I think you're in 2011. Yes, many times when I was lighter. And she actually reached out to me like two years ago. She wanted the match, but she wanted me to lose to 70 kilos. And I don't do that. I'm 80 kilos. That's my weight class. I'm not going to cut to lower than that.
SPEAKER_02: so i declined can i ask a question yeah have you have sarah have you pulled eggly before yes also many times i've never beaten her ever i was going to say that i would love to see at least first but i was also it was like i organized i organized that match yes yes and 10 years ago yeah and i was 65 kilo
SPEAKER_03: then and she worked for 80 i think now we're the same class now we're the same category so now would be more even i think yes yes yes it would be incredible but now he's uh one good female lion after she lost against gabriella and gabby i asked her like don't be discouraged you know you are one of the legends one of the ghosts that is not even
SPEAKER_03: a single day of training. So she was not. He's coming back. He's coming back for Barbara. He's coming back for Gabriela. And he's coming back for Sarah Beckman. This is exciting. So exciting. I don't want to say the details, but like,
SPEAKER_03: They bring, there are like two armies. And then the one that brings the news, there is an army with 30,000 people that are coming towards you. And it says that we are also going towards them. So that should be the attitude. If she's coming for you, Sarah, it means that you need to be going to her as well. Let's go. Yeah, yeah, that's what I want to do. Yeah, let's go.
SPEAKER_03: There are things to prove. There are things to prove. You are not training just to beat people in North America. It is too small for Sarah Beckman. That kind of goal and you, it doesn't fit. Because Sarah Beckman was Sarah Beckman. It's just something global, not limited to any continent. So hopefully we will see you. Cool.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, Silky Wilkie, I meant to say, should you have pressure if you think you will lose your wrist and or get opened up? It totally depends, depends on your style and your abilities, my friend. For me, no. For me, I like to remain with the hand control. But this for me. In arm wrestling, there is nothing like black or white.
SPEAKER_03: some people they do even they lose there is they and then they still beat the guy like this you know it's just totally up to your abilities okay so let's go to another one i will ask this do you know revas no okay let me ask this quickly so america uh
SPEAKER_04: It's so good. I mean, if it wasn't for you, Engen, or King of the Table, we wouldn't know guys like Chafee, Irakli had such strong presses. I mean, I don't think even those guys themselves would have known that they could press like they did. So I think that Revaz's hand might be a little bit better.
SPEAKER_04: But again, Chaffee's got so much side pressure. It's hard. It's very difficult. If I had to say, if I had to choose, I would say Rivas 3-2. I mean, whenever I think about Dave Chaffee, probably with the exception of Levan, I see every match moving
SPEAKER_03: his way we've been inside of dave we just do not know it's gonna end up on the pad or the guy will put a break but from here to there in my opinion if this guy had the hand of levan he would be just mopping the floor with everyone with that side pressure this guy's side pressure nobody has in my opinion and but his wrist sometimes doesn't handle his own
SPEAKER_01: pressure if the guy has incredible back pressure and how do you see that match so um i was gonna say it i i i got it three two four of us yeah yeah yeah um that's good to hear because uh we were agreeing on a lot of stuff so it's good to have a disagreement also i think that uh i think that dave is gonna take this uh because
SPEAKER_01: When I think of two things, like you're mentioning, how much back pressure does Rewaz have to bend Dave's wrist back? And I don't think him having more back pressure than Irmes has. And since this is a best of five, although Dave has already proved his endurance now,
SPEAKER_01: I think that if someone with extreme side pressure and hook comes, Dave is in a problem. But if someone comes at him with a hand and side pressure, Dave is winning the side pressure battle. Rivas may have a slightly better hand, although I don't believe so. But I think that Dave is taking this. Dave is taking this 3-1 and that one might come if he indeed starts losing his wrist back, gives up one round and then comes back with a dead wrist. But he's taking this one in my opinion.
SPEAKER_03: In my opinion, neither of these guys, they can afford to lose. Dave Sheffy has lost some matches. And Revas lost his last match against Morozov. So it is Revas' opportunity to prove, you know, if he is really in that group or one group below. And for Dave Sheffy, it was the first. He had three matches. He lost all. And
SPEAKER_03: Although the first two matches, he was winning 2-0 in endurance. But the last match, Hermes won 3-0. So I think that right now he's healed up because he hasn't been pulling since November. And I think he's coming here to prove something. Yeah, he cannot afford another loss. This is not from my perspective. For me, someone like Dave Steffi is always honored to have here.
SPEAKER_01: Ingen, can I ask a question on this regarding Dave Chaffee? I was very curious because we talk of his side pressure, his inside game, that his inside pulling, the twisting pressure is so much. The last two losses, apart from Hermes and Levan, the losses that he had against Gennady and Morozov, in both of them, people say that it was just endurance. It's not just endurance.
SPEAKER_01: with Gennari by the third round and with Morozov in the second round we saw Dave go down with his top roll and the moment he got locked a little bit in the wrist like they tried to set their hook in it seemed that Dave could not break that lock and he started losing on the inside so Dave is amazing but if he has one chink in his armor is it that his inside game has suffered a little bit
SPEAKER_03: if his endurance wasn't good enough it would affect everything you know so i don't know i don't know it's long subject i need to finish this and i want to ask amarindo about arif at them and this i don't know and then i will go to last match for uh sarah beckman uh i defend this i don't know how do you see this match
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so what I wanted to ask you first is, is Arif, is he healthy? Everything is good? No, he's not dealing with any injuries or anything? He's in good shape? Arif, because you know, Both are very healthy. Both are very healthy and both are very strong. I really don't know what's going to happen.
SPEAKER_04: That last event was my first time seeing Dissaronov, and that guy's got so much heart, man. He never quits fighting, so I was super impressed with him. I was super impressed that Arif beat Corey the way he did. I did not see that happening. I thought Corey was going to turn him into a hook and straight to the pad, but Arif top-rolled him, which Kordesha had a hard time doing. I will tell you something. Kordesha may have, because he's taller,
SPEAKER_03: over two meters as far as i know better hand wrist and back pressure but arif side pressure is stronger than so whenever you try to hook you know arif and then allow him to use his wrist
SPEAKER_04: The guy is moving sideways incredibly. So based off that, you know, Arif, I don't see Dizaronov taking Arif's hand or winning the hand battle. And like you said, if Dizaronov tries to put him into a hook, I see Arif flashing him. So I'm going 3-0 Arif on that one. And you?
SPEAKER_01: I think the weight difference is too much. Zarov is an amazing puller. In his category, it's good. He showed great heart in the left-hand against Wagner. But the weight difference is too much here. And if he stops it in a hook, Zarov can give anybody a run for his money. He's a legend. But I see that Arif is going to flash pin him. His top-end strength might be more. Okay, Sara. The last one.
SPEAKER_03: Listen, you know Gennady very well. You have been in the same European World Championships with him for many years, probably five years in a row until you quit and you left to North America. But during that time over here,
SPEAKER_03: So you know him, but now he's, of course, also a different level because this is not WAF, this is not Europeans. And you know Devon Larratt very well. Is Devon healed or does he still have his bicep injury? He is healed. I think that he is more dangerous than ever. The guy doesn't look normal. Everything is weird with the guy.
SPEAKER_04: I will say like he recently said in one of his his videos that he's he's not going to be doing any more of his one rep max weight lifts because he's worried about that bicep. He said it puts a lot of stress on his bicep to do those things like the preparation for like he did for preparation for Levan. So he said just going to be doing a lot of table pulling. I can tell by the way he was talking about it. He's still a little concerned with his bicep a little bit, you know, so and he knows he's got it. He's going to use every bit of it against Gennady. So
SPEAKER_02: I don't think Gennady is going to be a problem for Devin if he is in good shape. I'm not sure. But you are saying he's not going to be a problem? Yeah, I don't think so. I think it's going to be easy for Devin if he comes in in great shape. No injuries, no issues.
SPEAKER_03: I think he will be able to hold Gennady while Gennady is working and then pin him. Wow. Wow. Nobody predicted like this. People are thinking that it's going to be a tough match. Devon is going to win by endurance. And yeah, let's see. You may be right. You may be right. I kind of don't expect an easy match.
SPEAKER_03: and but about the endurance yesterday did you guys i don't know what but levan said that he thinks that gennady's endurance may be even better than devon's i know gennady is incredible endurance but like until he's proven to me devon has the best endurance but for sure i know that again is incredible endurance and i don't know i don't know how it will be but
SPEAKER_03: If Devon comes and dominates, like Sara says, I will be very surprised. I will be very surprised. And you know the things they are telling each other, right, Sara? No. I ask, I repeat this every program because the guest doesn't know what happened. And I asked, they were my guests, both Gennady
SPEAKER_03: And I asked Devon, Devon says that he's going to make Gennady quit. You know, we never see Gennady quitting, you know, you need to pin the guy, he still fights. And he says that he's going to make him quit. I said, do you really believe that he's going to quit? He said, Gennady is not going to say that, you know, I quit or, but he said that he will be like trying, but he will be as helpless as a cow that all four legs are cotton.
SPEAKER_03: You know, this is what you said. Yeah. And then you're not to get very angry. And he said, the things now change and he's going to destroy Devon. He's going to hit him until, until Devon says no more. Yeah. Yeah. No more until. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see how it will be. But, um, what do you think about this match guys?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think I expect a war. I do expect Devin to come out on top at the end, just because it seems like he always finds a way, especially in those long matches. And like you said, until proven otherwise, Devin is the endurance king. So I think 3-1, maybe 3-2 Devin.
SPEAKER_03: i mean how do you see that the two rounds cannot be winning in which way i we know that if he told yeah that's what i was thinking maybe like round one if devon goes like this and then he takes and then get out he would be hidden like this to forward like this and devon's elbow may be out but you know devon needs to be careful that that shoulder i mean the humer can be only this yeah anything like this you know
SPEAKER_04: in a neutral and losing position anything that the homer spin down angle will be called foul you know um i think about is is how close prudnik got once they got into the strap and how close prudnik was to pinning him and prudnik was mainly side pressure prudnik wasn't able to really get behind his shoulder yeah if not he gets behind his shoulder
SPEAKER_03: I guarantee he's going to have a lot more pressure than Prudnik had, so that's what makes him. What makes Prudnik special is his hand control. Yeah. The hand control, everything, the control. But once he loses his wrist, I don't think he's that super strong. While Gennady, even without wrist is good. Also, I mean, it depends. If Gennady is like this, maybe problem. But if the guy is open like this and Gennady put his
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. And then he did, he did, he did. 100% he's going to pin him. He will be probably applying wide pressure that would be good in such position. I'm not saying that in regular armors, but in such position and
SPEAKER_04: I don't know how it will be. That's the thing with Devin is he's able to open up so much and make it so difficult for the opponent to really get behind his shoulder. And watching the Prudnik match, I could see that Prudnik was trying so hard to get there, but Devin was keeping him opened up, and he couldn't really apply all that much pressure. So if he's able to do the same thing with Gennady, then it's going to be tough for Gennady to get a pin. But I think Gennady will be able to get behind his shoulder really well at least one round.
SPEAKER_03: and uh yeah and devon also mentioned his recent sorry sorry there is a funny funny question silky book is um funny guy and he's having seven cheating because he now has two biceps on the same arm effectively doubling his strength how have you overlooked this he's talking about the injury injury that you know trust me i have the same after macaro match sarah was there
SPEAKER_03: It's not fun at all, my friend. I don't know if I can show it, but it's really, I cannot. I cannot because the light is coming so full. Yeah, there's a ridge there. We can see there's a ridge. Yeah, but Tara was there too, but I cannot really show it. Just spend some time in Florida. Anyway, so what do you guys think? Do you think that he has now double biceps and he can, you know, double his strength?
SPEAKER_03: in such short time but there's one thing for sure the devon that showed up against prudnik uh this stone is going to be stronger than that than that version of course of course yeah crazy guy devon is not a normal guy yeah and his son having surgery if he didn't change the date you know what he was gonna do the day before was the surgery he was gonna jump or no uh two days before and then next day i think
SPEAKER_03: no he was yeah next no day before he was gonna bring his son to a hospital from hospital to home and then he was gonna jump in the plane and he was gonna come he was whenever he was arriving he was gonna be like four or five hours before the event the jet lag and travel and everything and he was gonna directly go to the stage and pull prudently he was ready to do that
SPEAKER_03: he came to date so he didn't have to do that the guy i would never pull that way you know i am also crazy guy but not that much you know i mean the guy is just like can you believe this yeah probably going to be stronger fortunately he's going to be stronger yeah yeah all right before you continue gennady will also be yeah strongest ever as this is probably the biggest match of his life he is pulling against the most famous guy
SPEAKER_03: one of the gods in the history and with what over a million yeah followers of social media so this is a big opportunity everyone who is pulling against gennady this is the biggest opportunity so gennady is coming there like a bull you can already see but today i had a video chat with devon the guy also doesn't look normal he is also good is his trappers huge and everything you know so these both guys
SPEAKER_03: I'm there by knowing what they will face, and that makes me... And, Sara, you know Gennady is mentally very strong guy. You remember, right? You remember how crazy he is at the table. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Who do you think is mentally stronger, Devon or Gennady? I think Devon. Devon had a hard life.
SPEAKER_03: uh you know uh the army special forces like and you can't be a special forces without a very strong mind and very secure in who he is so that is yeah yeah and and and gennady is one of those guys that with the biggest hearts and strongest mind as well so that that match yesterday when i asked levan he said that this is his dream match
SPEAKER_02: anyway so but sarah you also favored devon because he's a good friend of yours right yeah yeah i mean both both are good friends so like i i i both i want both to win but i think devon is stronger physically and mentally physically and mentally okay and you can finish your uh prediction that we can finish
SPEAKER_01: Sure. So I was saying that in the latest video that Devan had put up, not latest, a couple of days back, and he was analyzing his match with Gennady on Paul Italia's channel. And he said that I see Gennady having tiny bit more arm than me and me having tiny bit more hand than Gennady.
SPEAKER_01: So if it actually is tiny and there's not a huge gap in top end, then in my real complete belief, I think Devin is going to take it 3-0. Because he's going to manipulate the fouls also, the setup also. And what you were saying, Amarildo, about Gennady putting his shoulder back and pinning him, he will pin. But by the time that happens, Devin is going to take the first foul.
SPEAKER_01: And in the Kingsman. And by that time, he's tearing up. He's tearing up. I think the first round, only the match stops. That is my honest opinion. But as Engin said, Gennady, this is the biggest stage in his life. And that guy is crazy. So if he does, like if the top end is really 10% or even 5% off, Gennady is going to take it. He gets stronger, it seems, as the match goes on. Yeah, yeah. That guy doesn't seem to tire. Even against Ermes. Even against Ermes' match. Like he had lost. He's supposed to be dejected that he's lost. Nope.
SPEAKER_03: That guy is coming like crazy in the fifth round. So he's very mentally strong. Gennady is not normal. I mean, like Levan said, dream match. I mean, this is most of our dream match. This is insane. Okay. Anyways, guys, let's slowly finish it. Thank you very much, Sara. Which qualification are you planning to go? I'm not going to any qualification. You are not?
SPEAKER_02: No. Oh, I thought you were. Yeah. No. I say that with confidence there. I'm not going. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not going. I maybe maybe next. I had in my gym. You understand? Like it was in my gym. It was one week after surgery and I could not compete because it was one week after surgery and I just don't have the time. I'm so busy with my businesses and stuff. I don't have time to travel right now. Oh, OK. I understand.
SPEAKER_03: understand so you are not okay anyway so thank you very much sarah thank you and if you have anything more to say to the fans or anything you can and then we can yeah no thank you for everything yeah i'm happy to be here so thank you thank you very much take care thank you bye thank you thank you guys let's talk a little bit more and you guys want to add anything before
SPEAKER_04: We finish? Sure, sure. Please go ahead. With those trading cards, Ines said that, I'm assuming you, did you add up all the scores, Ines, and then divide it by how many categories there were and you came up with the numbers? Did you do that? Is that what you were saying? You said like genres of 95 or something? Whatever the category they have at the East versus West. So they're
SPEAKER_04: probably their numbers will be for that category. Well, have you ever thought of adding all the numbers and having one total, like out of a hundred, like what the score is out of a hundred? Have you ever thought about doing that on the, on the card?
SPEAKER_03: I think just to write the total number. Yeah, like I have, like you add up all the numbers, divide it, and then like John Brzenk is 97 out of 100, you know, whatever his pool is. You want us to mention that? Okay, yeah. We can save the fans to calculate all those. Yeah, well, I mean, it looks cool too. I think on the side,
SPEAKER_03: that is listen that that can lead uh to conclusions yeah like like argument that this guy has of this guy has the more most uh number total number why not this guy because as i explained this like having the most number doesn't always mean that you know like that you may be weak at one point and the guy may be very strong counter that weakness
SPEAKER_03: and then the guy can beat you and then people will say oh this guy with 91 beat this guy with 95 but that is not styles you know because people already says a lot of things i sometimes think i should ignore and this i also want to say about the the live commentating thing you know i don't understand how that went to such a big drama i said seriously i said i kindly ask
SPEAKER_03: because I think it's harming. And some people said they disagree. And some people says even they disagree, they respect. Let's finish at that point. Yeah, exactly. Trying to control our message. We are talking about East versus West. We are not talking about armed wars, king over the table, this and that. There are a lot of organizations. How am I controlling? Oh, if you are saying that trying to protect the brand that I own,
SPEAKER_03: then i think it's normal you know it's i think that i i have more right than any of those guys that wants me to convince them you know they some of them are acting like they are shared partners that i need to each of them i need to convince you know i just ask i don't have any authority officially whoever respects respects whoever doesn't respect doesn't respect why needed to talk why we have all those super matches incredible level
SPEAKER_03: I'm provided for the community and people all those and drama drama about this I mean that is what it was when I came as a promoter I thought I saved people from there so we could talk about actual armistice actual matchups actual resource actual things instead of like you know all nonsense unnecessary things you know
SPEAKER_03: But some people want to bury the community through unnecessary things. See, whatever we talk in this program is pure arm wrestling. But the arm wrestling is over. If I wanted to watch drama, I would just... I mean, I understand some hype, but even that needs to be about actual match-ups. People talk about things that...
SPEAKER_03: They are not really planning to organize. They are not really planning to, but they, they just talk about it. I would never talk like about a mesh or promote or do this guy. I would never hide the community with something that I'm not gonna do it. If I'm talking about it, either I set or it is on process. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, no need to just like finding all fake subjects and then coming, you know, and then like,
SPEAKER_03: F. Ponta and Apurva P. A perception, you know I mean of course they can, but it's not my type so i'm more focused on the hardcore to arm wrestling. F. Ponta and Apurva P. section or the Community.
SPEAKER_01: and there are so many of us like very recently i tried to not get into that but you know how facebook gets and there's this like 20 21 year old guy uh spewing a lot of like i'm sorry to use the words doing a lot of about live commentary thing i said do you understand in one event you have dave chafee john brazilian devon larat prudnik pulling can can you comprehend that can you imagine getting your head around that can you organize that
SPEAKER_03: if not you disagree understand but why are you talking about it there are so many good things happening i'm not doing anything i'm just investing everything and i'm just trying to secure the competition so that we can continue it's not going to be only six seven eight but we can go to the bring the armless into the next level to secure this dream is important for me
SPEAKER_03: making sure that every event i can pay atlas little more little more little little more you understand this is also my dream so this is what i try to do and i think it's harming some people think that it's not harming they disagree i respect what they think but at the end they are not the one who is risking anything they are not the one who is invested in anything i am the one investing and risking and taking all that stress and hard work so i thought that they would respect
SPEAKER_03: some did some didn't so then it's over no need for exactly no need to no need to talk weeks and weeks and weeks he said this he said that and like like
SPEAKER_04: I mean, come on, man. We are men, right? Come on. Yeah, it's a great point. Act like a man. Great point. The biggest thing with me is you've brought arguably the best commentators to East versus West. You brought Neil Pickup. You had Travis Bajan. Why would you want to listen to anybody else during these matches? That's what I'm saying. I mean, absolutely. The only thing that makes sense is they want chat room. But we can provide this chat room. They want to interact.
SPEAKER_03: i think it still will be results will be there and everything but what can i do if they want to have that kind of because they i understand that chat room idea because i'm gonna look you're a hardcore friend that's why you are here you are also hardcore friend that's why you are here but like you may not have someone in your home while you're watching the pay-per-view to share your excitement you know something you tell to your father he's like
SPEAKER_03: I don't care. You tell your mother or wife or kid or something, ah, you know, so that I understand that they want to share that excitement. I understand that part. So I realized that that's something I need to do. But again, I'm not, I don't have any authority to stop anyone. And after all that I hear, please, let me just continue doing it. Like, I'm not going to be part of this drama. You know, if you want to do live commentating, even though I request, just do it, you know.
SPEAKER_03: I don't have any any official authority to stop you I just ask you the friendly and twice I mentioned kindly and what I mean what is it that you know I'm a dictator or this do I talk about some other brands some other things we're talking about this versus this man like I mean like.
SPEAKER_03: i cannot even like share my own opinion about the baby that's your child exactly yeah yeah you know i mean i need to convince them if they are convinced i need to prove them like how about you proving me that it's not harming
SPEAKER_03: My world versus your world. But I am the one who is risking, who is investing. You are nothing. I mean, not that you are nothing, but you are not risking anything. Yeah. And the same people like this. This is what really bothered me. That's why I got into a debate with this person barely a year into the sport.
SPEAKER_01: He was talking about this live stream thing. The same person was also talking about not watching it on the pay-per-view. I said, you can't bother to pay $15. You're not bothered to pay $15 for a sport that you say you love. And you're questioning a person who is investing more than $150,000. Do you listen to yourself? What are you talking about? My friend, about that part, if you talk about American, if you talk about the Western European, $15, I understand.
SPEAKER_03: But from the east side of the world, $15 still maybe, you know. Maybe. But I wouldn't, listen, people don't have to buy it. Yeah. Like I have seen comments, like I don't do well economically, but like financially, but I'm going to buy it. And I said, my friend, please don't buy. Don't buy because this is not like food or drink or, you know, you understand? Like money may be more important for you, especially if you are having a hard time, you know.
SPEAKER_03: i'm not like yeah but just um like one guy wrote something that um oh yeah jacobin jacobin yesterday i misunderstood you um i i misunderstood your intention um i get upset with you later i realized this i apologize you my friend i apologize you um okay
SPEAKER_03: um a lion doesn't concern uh doesn't concern himself with the opinions of sheep have you ever heard that saying yeah but but i i try to express myself to community because if i ever label myself as a lion and rest all the people who disagree with me as a sheep then then danny will be a disrespect but
SPEAKER_03: But I think that some people, someone wrote here that Engels said officially that you can do it, so no more drama. My friends, do you really believe that all those people were doing this because I wrote this? No, my friend, they are looking for a reason, an opportunity to bring East versus West down in every opportunity. That's their intention.
SPEAKER_03: They want East versus West to finish. Just trust what I say. I know what I'm talking about. I know more than what I share here. That is their intention to create that kind of perception. They will use any kind of opportunity. They don't have good intention. Trust me. They will say this. Next time they will say that. This time they will say that. That is like we finally did something like really high level promise. It's not what I say.
SPEAKER_03: people like John says, Devon says, and many others says. And these people, because of their jealousy, they want to kill this dream. And whenever I get upset, it is the reason, like Amarildo says that I shouldn't be concerned, but like this, Amarildo, believe or not, my motivation is the love and passion I have this support. And whenever I see, like, the community starts, like,
SPEAKER_03: not to appreciate what I do. Like if my motivation was money, trust me, I wouldn't argue with people at all. I would just say, oh yeah, you're right, and this and this. I'm not that type of guy. I'm a person with principles. I would rather go away than being a fake or just saying, oh, okay, yeah, you're right, and this. I'm just 100% myself. Some people likes it, some people doesn't like. Some people likes fake people, some people likes to,
SPEAKER_03: be like treated you know as they only wish but in fact i just say my opinion and then and they they don't like it or some people they just i don't want to mention maybe they ask me something but they didn't get it about east versus west and because of this they feel rejected and they are doing this kind of
SPEAKER_03: things, you understand my point, but I cannot give anyone what they don't deserve. Right. You know, there needs to be a reason. You may say that in some of the matches you organized, maybe it wasn't that really East versus West level. But even there is a logic, my friend. I need to cover these events. Sometimes I need to do many elite matches and some to help the pay-per-view. You understand? Like, trust me, I have good intention. I'm trying to
SPEAKER_03: balanced everything. That's what I wanted to say.
SPEAKER_01: Ingen, I want to say something because the first time you started Instagram, it was in 2020, I believe, right in the time of Corona. And you were one of my favorite arm wrestlers when I was following this sport earlier when I was a child. And the moment I saw you on Instagram, I was, oh, Ingen Terzi on Instagram. And I was thinking, why would he notice I'm just a fan? And I mentioned in the comments that
SPEAKER_01: uh about a match between pushkar and devon uh may god rest his soul uh and you took time to write like in two paragraphs how you thought about it and why you thought devon was the best in 2007-8 and uh
SPEAKER_01: I was just blown away that a superstar of the game, not just a superstar person at that caliber, would take so much time to write to a person who doesn't even know about arm wrestling. So I just wanted to say something. There were people who were saying that, let's say you're a basketball fan and imagine that LeBron James comes and meets you or Kobe Bryant comes and meets you and talks to you about basketball tips.
SPEAKER_01: it is exactly like that for arm wrestling fans when someone like john brusing meets stops and talks to them so people in arm wrestling community are amazing and people like you who are giving us chance to be a part of that it feels like you're on the ninth cloud yeah everyone i need to cut you here but yeah i appreciate everything you said um i don't really my life view doesn't really categorize people if you talk about arm wrestling
SPEAKER_03: i i talk highly about certain people but if for me superstar or this and this and this to me no yeah i understand not not important trust me it totally also depends on how you come if you come in a positive manner for sure i may misunderstand you but as i did apologize the guy
SPEAKER_03: and you may say that okay you break his heart and then you apologize it is because sometimes when i see so many negativity and saying i also get affected you understand and i make mistakes but if you come positive way i will also uh respond uh in a positive way but just never make anyone big on your head you know just like superstar or something
SPEAKER_03: not like that but you know friends who love our message we're talking about do you realize that our superstar guest left but we still talk here about yeah you know yeah i love it i can talk another hour you know i could just say okay thank you guys bye but yeah and i'm honestly and you you
SPEAKER_04: anything that you want to say my friend generally based based off what we just talked about i'm glad that you and devin made up and are not uh having any questions that period was that period was stressful for me i was like oh devin and angan no please i was like they need to know where to make people make mistakes about those kind of things some people they don't realize that we are friends for like 20 years and no matter we disagree about something we have deep
SPEAKER_03: respect for each other we have this deep respect some people i don't want to say but some people just chooses to fight and kiss his ass and then try to be like fighting with kings more than king himself you understand and then this kind of people um at the end see that we still are friends so they
SPEAKER_03: whatever they did to get involved that negatively resulted only for them exclusion. You know what I mean? Yeah. So no need, you know, if you see me with that one, he says something I said back. Yes. I love it. Yeah. Don't get involved too deeply. You can say your opinion, but don't be like, you know, like all kinds of negative things and disrespect just to kiss the ass or the,
SPEAKER_03: guided you look up highly no need we need to protect the uh personality you know just no need to be like doing this you know yeah those those like if you realize that whenever i have any kind of argument with that one that's usually armless and related either direct strap or if it is this you know like that there is nothing like whenever i see i have my view
SPEAKER_03: If I see that is wrong for arm wrestling, I get involved because the guy influences. A lot of people. A lot of people. At that point, I said, Devon, you are my good friend, but I love arm wrestling more than I love you. I'm going to tell what I believe in. I'm not saying I'm right, but I'm not going to, like the love that I have for sports makes me tell what I believe.
SPEAKER_03: as a community decides who is right who is wrong yeah i wish i wish we were we were closer amarillo and that you would give me some tips about injuries because yeah because someone who is who knows as much as you do but also arm wrestling fan because like people being like that but doesn't know about arm wrestling they don't really they don't really know much yeah
SPEAKER_01: And I told you, I'm going to make it out to an East-First-West event eventually, and you'll have all my undivided attention when I'm there. Every day. If you want me to work on you every day, you'll get it. I'm going to hit you up too. I started arm wrestling like a year ago, and I had a bicep tendon injury from earlier parts. I didn't know that. So now that I know this, I'm going to hit you up. Okay. I'm going to be your patient. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: trust me i don't know if you guys enjoy this show because we had to talk um you guys maybe didn't talk enough but i really enjoyed i really enjoyed and thank you very much for coming and being my guest so thank you again good question we have 11 matches yes yes yes yes and then you've how many have you announced for east versus west eight how many matches
SPEAKER_03: Have you announced already publicly? You announced Levan Morozov, you announced Ermi Zingeri and who else for East Brazil? That's all. That's all. That's it? Okay. I don't want to go any further. I made that mistake because any kind of results from the upcoming event and yeah, result and injury and this and that, it is not like I was kind of overpassionate, you know, sometimes. But now,
SPEAKER_03: We all are learning, we all are learning. As an art master, I'm learning, as a promoter, I have a lot to learn, a lot to learn, you know?
SPEAKER_01: On that note again, I actually remember this, like the first time I chatted to you on Instagram, I said, like, the first time you'd come on Instagram, and I mentioned that I would love to see you get back fighting again in 2020. But I remember that you'd organized such an amazing event for Arsene and John's match. So do you plan on getting back into promotion again? And you just said, wait, my friend, wait. And this was back in...
SPEAKER_01: yeah this was like towards the end of 2020 and you just said wait my friend yeah there is a lot of problems in promotion you don't understand but i'm also thinking and then 2021 comes and east versus west comes whole crowdfunding thing and from crowdfunding to what is happening in east versus west six it feels like we are seeing this thing grow up together and i just feel like we're lucky to be a part of this community it's an amazing community yeah yeah it's like i always say that this is
SPEAKER_03: our baby our baby we do all together you know all together but i am the one who runs and i want people to care about my opinion what is good for the event and of course i care about the opinions i ask you guys what to do what to do what to do because my friends i mean the pride is such a terrible thing you know such a terrible pride it's just like i know everything type of thing of course
SPEAKER_03: i don't know everything but of course like if you talk about armless most likely i will know more than you do but just yeah but but it doesn't mean pride but i mean if you just come and try to reach me you know wrong and you just need to be like this for nature needs to be like this then i would probably set you where you need funny yes it's funny how can someone say it's just funny but normally i don't come and just like
SPEAKER_03: say, I'm like this, what do you know? And this is just stupid. But again, we need to really talk and improve. Whatever you say, I'm like, oh, yeah, yeah, it's a good idea. I read everything, but I decide what it is.
SPEAKER_04: That's why I've never really, I didn't know much about you before you started doing these East versus West events, but then I started to do my homework and look at your previous matches and everything. But one thing I've learned is there's no reason to question your intention because who would be asking so much of the community? Who would be asking so much feedback?
SPEAKER_04: if it wasn't for somebody who wanted to grow this thing or make it the the best it could be anybody who didn't want that they wouldn't care what the community thought they would think well who are these people i don't care i can do it myself you know maybe you ask other other businessmen or other athletes but but you're constantly always trying to find you know ways to improve by asking the community and yeah for me attitude is important intention is important my friend the way you come to me if you just come to me in a disrespectful way really like like
SPEAKER_01: Just constantly measure the mirror. That's enough. Engin, I have a question for you. I mean, 30 years so far in wrestling, your body has taken a lot of beatings. But as fans, I know it is too much to ask. You're organizing. You're doing everything about the back end of East versus West. And to ask you to compete in the event also is a little too much. I understand. But when I see how you did in that event when eight of you were participating and you had a match with Viral Dobrin,
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I was in good shape. That shape of me, I would like to see myself against David Samusha. Even if we are in the same weight, anyone else, maybe with the exception of Sasho. Because that guy's inner side pressure is kind of... But other than that, under 85 kilos,
SPEAKER_03: with that shape. I like it. Nobody can say that they would beat me for sure. I'm not saying I would beat everyone, but there is a possibility all those young guys to lose against me with that shape. That shape was good. Yeah. Oh my God. I was like this, this thing, and we need to see this. I remember writing back to you after the injury that you had with Arthur Makaro. Had that not happened, like you had that in the back.
SPEAKER_03: that match was yours Arthur himself told me that yeah right after the match he came he saw my biceps and he said that you are the winner you know like but but trust me I mean everyone knows Arthur himself knows but no matter what we talk you know he won the match officially technically he won the match but I was I was good I was better than him like the same year Alam Makaev beat him yeah they had three matches one Arthur won
SPEAKER_03: on fouls and the two Alham won. Those three matches took more than two minutes at the Waffles. First two rounds I won against Arthur was nine seconds. Nine seconds. The first one was four seconds and the second one was five seconds. But the second one, I beat him like probably maybe not the first second, but the second one. I
SPEAKER_03: Like, I felt that, you know, I injured. Something from here went down, like, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
SPEAKER_03: a tractor is pulling you that's that oh yes just trust me that guy is incredible and his side pressure also incredible yeah stay side pressure but i was able to take his everything his wrist yeah yeah and that that is why i told my bicep because i put i put i put my right foot to do the corner like yeah okay yeah so whenever whenever i hit
SPEAKER_03: you can see in this strap even in the strap his his hand his hand went like this this is you rarely see his hand went sliding in my hand i hit him so hard here forget about here he he went like this you took everything so there is no resistance here what you do you pull more you pull back continue in fact you pull in the strap and he's left
SPEAKER_03: There is no brachioradialis or bicep that is stronger than this guy's leg. So the more I pulled, the more I met a power that my arm couldn't handle. Because if this was resistant, I was still pulling something. There was nothing to resist. So what I did, I pulled him like I could lift him from the
SPEAKER_03: that which is impossible so more i pull i felt like instead of his coming my bicep went like tick tick tick tick you understand like yeah he went well because he lost everything i came closer and was able to pin him but the following round when we start in equal position my arm already like ah yeah you weren't able to hold no no my angle just opened even after the match
SPEAKER_03: the joshua you know joshua justin grant yeah of course yeah his his friend was the physiotherapist she came and she she pulled my arm like this it was just like from here to here it was just like moving like this yeah and that's and usually usually a tear in the middle of the muscle is is work is the worst because you can't really repair that when you tear the tendon off the bone you just surgically tie that back in you know but when you tear like you and devin did
SPEAKER_03: can't really repair that you know that's just it just stays like that yeah that's why that ridge is showing up in your arm as well the way it is in tevin yeah yeah that tear i don't know i did some bicep course some days ago with 20 kilo and my bicep hurt and then after that i did some table time since then it is like like hurting i feel like it's deep pain deep pain there so it means it's still not strong and you know that there are two heads
SPEAKER_03: that this is a longer yeah this inner one went down but this side is okay flop wrist presser again just forget about my joints with these joints i would be i would be lost in the world with these joints that is why i need to have incredible hand and pronator and take the guy everything
SPEAKER_03: And then I can press them because my elbow doesn't handle that direct pressure. Once I work on you, we'll make your elbow steel. I may go to Mexico for stem cells. Yeah. Because the one that I had here, I mean, it helped, but I cannot say that, you know,
SPEAKER_03: I don't feel like Devon feels. If I would feel as healthy as Devon feels now, still everyone is in trouble, but I really don't feel that way.
SPEAKER_03: Mexico, Panama, Colombia, and Venezuela are the top when it comes to stem cells. Those countries. Whenever I say that if I feel like Devon, everyone is true, I talk about guys under 85 kilos. And Devon if it comes to 100 kg, right? One day that mess will happen. That was the old Devon. The new Devon that I see around, it's not the same Devon.
SPEAKER_01: and then the entire world is waiting for that john the the way uh devon went to john's house for the practice and that was not released ever since then john is like oh this devon is different so hopefully in his uh documentary we get to see that practice and see what john saw that's right yeah people are asking if i and idarkan is in same weight i think i am now about 15 kilo heavier than either but five years ago four and a half years ago we pulled at waff
SPEAKER_04: I still remember Haidar at the weigh-ins when he pulled his shirt up and flexed his bicep. It was crazy. No, not Haidar. I say Haidar Khan. No, Dalat Haidar Khan. Yeah, Dalat Haidar Khan. Yeah, Haidar. You're talking about Haidar Gildim, right?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the one that was the highlight of the press in my opinion. Oh, my God. People are blown away. The arm like this that he pulls the shirt goes and it's like, yeah, yeah. But this is small. You should have seen him in his prime, in his prime. Yeah. The guy is almost 60 years old. He's yeah, yeah. I know he's 57, 57 years old. The guy in his prime was incredible. He'd be big guys, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Engin Terzi satellite track, I think under 105 kg everyone would be in danger. No, my friends. I can only be competitive under 85 kg, not even 90 kg. 85 kg
SPEAKER_04: i i wanted to ask you again so a lot of people were thinking that that todd kind of at his peak in in terms of his weight was you know 240 250 pounds but then i watched don hutchings yes okay and then i heard him on a on an interview with uh aussie arm wrestler with jake ward and jake's jake asked him right before he was supposed to pull ryan bowen todd how much are you weighing
SPEAKER_04: And he said 217. And he said, I've never really been over 230. Yeah, that's true.
SPEAKER_01: i mean that yeah but a lot of people seem to think that todd when he pulled mad mask when todd pulled uh prudnik when this is what i heard when he pulled they will not they said he was 240 or something 249 pounds so i think that was a little inflated in my honest opinion i think just for that match just because he was pushed away from the that category just for that match and you know they get weighed in for all their clothes the jackets on all of that stuff
SPEAKER_04: so yeah when he pulled zoloyev he was 97 kg hanging is that right what's that uh todd hutchings was 97 96 kg when he pulled zoloyev 100 yeah weight category was 97 but he weighed 97 he was probably over 100 competition time because he like he barely made the weight you know with the water cart and everything how much how much was he
SPEAKER_01: against brutnik yeah how much was he there 105 i think he was 105 105 i think yeah okay yeah gotcha um i mean i would love to see him and sasho at 100 or 95 kg man that would be that that's my dream a super match yeah super match between them and again since you mentioned like 85k you said that even 90 kilo competitive
SPEAKER_01: one person that i want to see once like just as a fan i'm asking if that's possible because there might be too many problems how is uh like bulgaria is amazing those people have so jordan sonar has already been to east versus west krasimir has been sasho is coming so only our top ruler uh what's his name he beat oh my god blaben so plamen dimitrov we are yet to see what's up with is there any plan of having plamen there yeah i mean plamen is good friend of mine okay and a great guy
SPEAKER_03: With me, everything is super good. But there are some internal problems within Bulgaria. But I would like especially Gachevski. I would like Gachevski. I'm a big, huge fan of Gachevski. Gachevski versus Samusha. Oh, that is an amazing, that is a dream match. That is a dream match. Gachevski is now 52 years old, 53 maybe even.
SPEAKER_03: very strong this year but that guy legends and you see that he's pulling like this yeah in the past he was all about right this side this but mostly straight side pressure incredible but because of hitting all the time side elbow same as mine get trouble so this guy had to take the pressure away from his elbow he had to go far
SPEAKER_03: you realize that the more we get older, the more we are just, you know, making our elbow, like, away from the pressure, you know. The same, Michael did it after a certain time. Devon, crazy George, I don't think he was doing that at the beginning of his career. I guess he is doing. I remember myself ending up like this, of course, not on the table.
SPEAKER_03: but like this against uh the first super match and okay guys i think i need to finish i need to finish but it was fun trust me i can talk longer but i do this in a podcast every day and and after when it is every day every day every day it's becoming a little bit exhausting i'm having some kind of headaches or something
SPEAKER_03: but still two hours we have been together. But if I didn't have headache, we would go another one hour. Yeah, it was really nice to meet you guys. Nice to meet you, man. It was an honor. Thank you for- It was an honor, it was an honor. Same for us, same for us. Thank you so much again. Yeah, I thank you guys and you all take care. Take care, take care guys, everyone in the church.
