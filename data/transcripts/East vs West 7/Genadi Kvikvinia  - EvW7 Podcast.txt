SPEAKER_02: In your opinion, I was just asking what will be a good training outside of armors and get better finger strength for holding. My friend, for me, the, the, the handling the pressure is more important than applying pressure. And I used to be a roofer. I work on the roof, those single bundles, they were like, probably
SPEAKER_02: 85 pounds or something they were like thank you can you hear me yeah yeah i hear you but you see it but and you see me too right yes yes i do yeah great and i was carrying two of them at once as long story but um because you couldn't grab them your fingers were staying like this i think they're not came another is here
SPEAKER_02: Hello, Genadi, how are you? Genadi, my friends, everyone is thinking that you are scared of Devon. And that is why you don't post anything on YouTube. Devon says that you will not come to Istanbul. You are scared. Is that true? Sorry, I was moderating the chat. Sorry, sorry. Can you please repeat?
SPEAKER_00: Devon is saying that Gennady is not on social media because Gennady is scared of Devon. And Devon says that Gennady will not even come to Istanbul because he is so scared. Why? Why? Why?
SPEAKER_04: These are my thoughts. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today.
SPEAKER_00: So he said that the reaction about what Devon told about him was like, pity Devon, pity Devon, he kept saying it. Then he said that about his latest updates about why he was missing from social media is that currently right now- Can you speak a little bit louder? Yeah, I could.
SPEAKER_00: So currently he's in the building that is his like future store so he was just renovating the gate and taking care of it so that's why this like eight days of later is he he's out of this social media but.
SPEAKER_00: Whenever he saw Devon's video, he kept sharing them and then he said about the video when Devon has this long nose, you know, one of Devon's video, he said that if it was boxing, if it was real boxing match, but not arm wrestling, he would really have made Devon's nose like that. But since it's only arm wrestling, the best he could do to Devon is to just
SPEAKER_00: break there was arm so that he would just hang his arm like this and then uh go back to canada that's basically okay okay because devon also said that he's gonna break again at his shoulder
SPEAKER_02: that's a screwdriver like automatic and he said that i'm gonna screw it down he's gonna screw devil's shoulder can you did you did he see that today uh i couldn't reach devon but devon says that he injured his thumb he may have surgery did he did he see that video
SPEAKER_04: Gena, have you ever seen Devon's video? Have you ever seen Devon's video? Yes, I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it. I've seen it.
SPEAKER_00: uh-huh so he's saying that they should stop crying about it because uh we are men and uh sometimes we break our fingers like he himself also has broken it a couple times or maybe a thumb or something like that but as we are men we have to keep fighting and uh put ourselves 100 regardless so stop crying does he does he think that devon is just like creating excuses to
SPEAKER_04: You know, run away from Gennady. Anu, you said that you would like to say something about your experience and what you think about it, and what you think about your experiences and what you would like to say about it, for example, in the video. I don't have anything to say. I don't have anything to say. I would like to say that I came to Canada.
SPEAKER_00: he says that that's the only way uh devon has left like that's the only way the outcome like to make excuses and he repeated himself that he will break leon's uh deon's entire arm and hang it on his shoulder and uh make him yeah send it to kind of like that there is only one way they want to survive from this is just to create excuses and not to show up yes
SPEAKER_04: Okay, I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And can you ask him, how is his training? Like, is he, what's his shape?
SPEAKER_00: so so far uh as his training goes on and on he's actually increasing a bit slowly but increasing the weights so he's keep progressing and whatever shape he is right now that's not gonna be the shape he's gonna show up because he keeps progressing but he said that like last two weeks like 15 days before match he will slowly start to rest okay the question is there any possibility
SPEAKER_00: I remember during the pandemic, he was in incredible shape. I saw him with some trainings. Does he think that he will reach to that shape? Or not possible? I would like to ask you a question. You said that you were in the form of a horse.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, it's easy for you to say, oh, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but,
SPEAKER_04: I can't remember the exact date, but I think it was around the end of the 20th century. There were 10,000 people in the city. It was a 90-degree wall. The walls were made of metal, and there were no walls in the city. But there were 10,000 people in the city. Your record is... There were 95,000-96,000 people in the city. There were no metal walls in the city.
SPEAKER_00: uh so uh about his uh trainings like he said he keeps getting uh um progressing and progressing but once he he did like personal record pr on his
SPEAKER_00: single bicep curl single arm bicep curl is like 100 kg he did once and the angle was quite close to 90 uh 90 degree degree but in order to uh not sustain any injury he just tries to be very careful so he only did it once and now he's doing like 85 90 kg at most
SPEAKER_00: uh this single bicycle uh regarding to his weakest point right now is that the thing that he cannot uh do that much from both arms is that his left arm was kind of bad left biceps he had injury and now he this lefty also is getting back to shape so he did like 130 kg or bicycle or with both arms with two hands 130 he said
SPEAKER_00: and uh but left is still quite not in the best shape it was injured so now he's only doing like single one one reps one one arm reps yeah so i mean basically that will he be at his best ever shape when he peed yeah yeah and he actually i almost forgot so good that you uh we asked it uh he started by saying that uh uh his pandemic shape what he had he already surpassed those weights that he he was pulling during bedtime
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay. Now he's even better in shape than that one. Yeah, yes. That's what he said. Oh, okay. So he's coming in like incredible shape. Yeah, he said that this Devon match motivated him the most he has ever been. Oh, okay. He's very motivated. Like, does he take this match any little personal? Like after the last podcast with Devon?
SPEAKER_00: Gena, when you were on the podcast, you were with us for a long time, and you were talking about what you were going to do in the future. Do you have any plans for the future? Do you have any plans for the future? No, I don't have any plans.
SPEAKER_00: He's saying that, yeah, I mean, to be honest, Devon really angered me. That's what Gennady said from the last contest. And he said that Devon should have two bodyguards, but both of them should be bigger than Gennady because
SPEAKER_00: I mean, if something goes in a sideways during the press conference, he may just jump over again. He may just jump over the tables and just rush to Devon and something may get broken there or physical or something. So Devon should have some like at least two bodyguards bigger than Gennady. Just in case. We need to bring there some security. Yes, yes. OK, OK, OK, OK. And can you tell him how confident is he?
SPEAKER_00: He wants to show you one picture, if you remember about this picture. Oh, yeah. Okay, one second. Can he bring it closer?
SPEAKER_03: I see you there, Engin, on that picture. I see myself, but who's the other guy? OK, who is he? .
SPEAKER_00: Hello, hello, hello. How are you, he's asking. Yeah, yeah, thank you, thank you. I hope you're OK as well.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, Roman, these people are... Yeah, Beso is saying that you are a really good person and all the time he speaks positively about you. Thank you. Beso, Beso. Oh, Beso, yeah, thank you, thank you. You know, these are like, almost became like family, you know, from early 90s, there was Zaur, there was David Shalitze, and there was...
SPEAKER_02: and there was some Karadze and others. After that, later there was like
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah and then later in the 2000s 2000s there was like now it came like java and gennady and some new and then after that like i know georgian generation for 30 years you understand from early 90s you know and
SPEAKER_00: Gennady is from the mid-middle of the 2000s. Gennady, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Englin. Now he's showing your polling video that you don't even have it. Even you don't have this video that he's showing you.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah, yeah. It's just Pata, yeah. Pata, Pata, yeah. Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gennady, in the competition, I pulled the Russian final, Valery Gusov from Othetia. Valery Gusov? Yeah. And he also beat Rustam Bave around those times. And then in the final, Gennady, I beat him.
SPEAKER_02: I was so like crazy angry guy, you know, and referee said, strap. And I was just more angry. And then, you know, you know, Niazi, right? Niazi. And Niazi is photo. And then me, ready, go. Boom. Final, final, final. Ready, go. Did you take picture? Picture. And then I let the guy to do this close. He's trying to beat. And then I was like, did you take picture? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: boom you know final match you know just like uh but i was just a little bit crazy yeah because of the referee referee not the opener
SPEAKER_01: I will briefly translate in details. He remembers, yeah, he knows that story, Genadi said. Genadi knows, yeah, yeah, yeah. You are a very big, big sportsman, that's what he said.
SPEAKER_02: he's asking you about the possible match if you get in shape if you are trying to get in shape for some mission yeah but now no now samusha here me here now but slowly maybe maybe maybe we will see yeah it's good to hear it
SPEAKER_00: i'm very happy that you are okay that the only reason sorry he has some audio issues he can cannot hear and he will fix it well i hear you i hear yes for me everything was fine yeah for me everything was fine again against me
SPEAKER_00: I guess Gennady has a problem. He asked me to repeat myself. It's lagging. He got a call on his phone and it connected. Now he will leave us and then we join.
SPEAKER_00: oh yeah yeah there was a picture yeah yeah oh you got some super chats yeah i will ask him yeah whenever he comes back yeah he's trying to leave now or yes so he wants to leave and then come back yeah and hopefully it will get better like fixed
SPEAKER_00: uh at first you and you told me my audio was kind of low now it is okay right i i switched it was not because of the the settings but because you were speaking a little bit low volume could be
SPEAKER_02: No, no, my friend. I need to go down to 85 kilos. Oh, you mean to 75? 75, I cannot go down to. I mean, I can. I can. I'm just like one crazy guy. I made 65 kilos. 143 in 2018 when I was 44 years old. I was 85 kilos. But I made 65 kilos. I won the world. He's big. Everything is good. Yeah, yeah, that's good. There is a question. Thank you for your super chat.
SPEAKER_02: Gennady, what if Devon holds you and tells you, yells at you, . It's a question. He understands. He understands.
SPEAKER_00: even if uh even if devon uh appears and shows up like 100 times stronger than kenadi if devon during that moment or any time any moment in arm wrestling screams opana
SPEAKER_00: Gennady will rip his arm off because that's his signature like this type of yelling voice speech award and he gets he gets stronger and stronger so it's actually bad if he does it or them if Devon does Opana to him and then he will only make Gennady stronger exactly
SPEAKER_00: yeah he just said that he gennady will be the one who stops him and calls him to tell him to fight him oh yeah yeah yeah gennady tell us my friends how much do you really believe you can beat devon
SPEAKER_00: he's saying that uh it may and most likely will be a fight very tough match so i he didn't say but i guess he's saying that it will be all five rounds will be performed
SPEAKER_00: but uh in the end he will win so i guess three two maybe he brought up the example of his match against dave chafee everybody was sure after two zero when
SPEAKER_00: Gennady was down to 2-0. He said that everybody was already saying that it's done and they would win. But he himself personally was sure in his plan that he would end up victorious against Dave. So that's why he brought up this example. So it may happen the same. The difference is that Devon is the one usually, you know, comes back stronger every round, you know.
SPEAKER_02: that his endurance, it doesn't concern Gennady. Like, Devon's endurance, we always see that, like, at some point of the match, makes his opponents helpless. Does it not concern him, you know? Like, for me, like, I know Gennady has incredible endurance, but he really believes that his endurance is better than Devon's.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you. Yes, thank you very much. I would like to ask you, Gena, what do you think about the fact that, as you said, there is a lot of use for plutonium. What do you think about the fact that, when a drug is used, the amount of plutonium that is used increases?
SPEAKER_00: yeah and gennady didn't even let me finish he already knew what i was about to translate so and he asked you where and when have you have seen gennady exhausted during armistead have you ever seen him exhausted tired not not tired not tired yeah i mean yeah
SPEAKER_00: He's saying that Devon would not be even better in endurance against Gennady, not even in arm wrestling entirely, not even in football or volleyball or even boxing. Gennady would be better in every aspect. In every aspect, yeah. Okay, I understand, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And there are two superchats. Can you read? Thank you, Silky Wilkie, because you can directly, just you can read English and also Georgian. From Silky Wilkie's superchat, right? Yeah. Can you read in English as well? Okay. This question goes to Gennady. Do you feel inadequate when facing someone with a bigger thumb than you?
SPEAKER_00: Devon seems to have the girth to intimidate you. Okay. Gena, I would like to ask you one more question. What do you think is the most appropriate or not? In fact, when you look at yourself, do you think you are a small and massive piece of glass? Yes, a piece of glass. I don't know what to say. A piece of glass is a piece of glass.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Judging by his reaction, he's definitely not intimidated by that one. And he said that this stamp is not... Why are people keep saying and talking so much about this stamp? Is this stamp going somewhere else? Or why are we talking about this stamp all the time?
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that thumb is not the decisive factor, so definitely, he's not intimidated. OK, Gena, . DB Talks, another super chat. Devon's favorite move is the can opener, but will Gennady perform the can opener on Devon?
SPEAKER_00: He said that that's what he's trying to do, to open up Devon's arm like this.
SPEAKER_00: He's planning to take Devon's risk? Yeah, he's planning to take Devon like this, yeah. Wow. So Devon will be like this, not him, not Gennady, but Devon. No, no, I understand. I understand. I said that, sorry. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Silky Wilkie. Thank you, D.B. Tolt, for your support. I think there is one more. Yeah, it's...
SPEAKER_02: Thank you very much. They are asking, what does opana mean? Gena, can you explain what opana means? What does opana mean and what is the meaning of it? For example, when you eat something,
SPEAKER_04: This Georgian way of thinking is very different from the Georgian way of thinking. It is different from the Georgian way of thinking. This Georgian way of thinking is very different from the Georgian way of thinking.
SPEAKER_00: Well, Gennady brought up his childhood example to make it easier for people to understand. He said that
SPEAKER_00: uh back in his childhood he used to uh be a fond of jumping from the heights into the water for instance from the bridges to the rivers or like maybe say there were some pool and like from the height and this adrenaline and stuff and he said that during these times in from his childhood he would uh say those words and it's basically the purpose that that word serves is to encourage him
SPEAKER_00: like it encourages him when he says this opana yeah it kind of gives him more like confidence more like you know gets more enthusiastic whatever he's doing and excited so just the world of world of motivation world of motivation yeah in georgian it doesn't have a specific one minute yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: um engine can you send the link to devon now to surprise gennady uh he has the link but i'm not sure if he's available or not i'm sure he's watching us i'm not sure i don't know i don't know he may be busy he may be busy you know as you know that he injured his thumb and so maybe maybe he's trying to heal that right now yeah
SPEAKER_02: what is today's date today's date yeah it's the first april april 1st well today is april 1st oh okay yes wow we are already in april huh i didn't have any intention like time flies so fast yeah i'm wondering about the calendar days yeah yeah anyway so then can you ask him who is he training with
SPEAKER_00: get ready does he do table train i hope he's not only training on the uh with the waist you know yeah uh oh he said rivers rivers
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he said that Revas is enough. Samushia as well. For technical aspects, because Vilen is very light.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know how I would have been able to do it if I didn't have the opportunity to do it. I don't know how I would have been able to do it if I didn't have the opportunity to do it. I don't know how I would have been able to do it. I don't know how I would have been able to do it.
SPEAKER_04: All the champions are very talented. For example, Darbyl Sheikha and Darchashvili are very talented, and they work with Magida. They are very talented.
SPEAKER_00: He's saying that those names, like he started by Rezo, technically Rezo is already enough because we know how good Revas is. But other than Revas, Samushia, he said, he said Vilani Gabrava as well, Zirakashvili, Irakli, also has joined the crew. He has been already, he worked out twice with Revas, but Gennady was not there available because he already told us he has to do some business this last one week or so. So he was kind of out and
SPEAKER_00: did not train with them but basically he said that in tbilisi that's the capital i'm sure you already know uh there are like 30 to 35 world champion arm wrestlers already in that city around here yeah yeah and gennady could just whenever he wants whoever he wants he could just call them and press the table training he wants yeah exactly he says yeah yeah and the other day she also
SPEAKER_01: Tell him to be careful not to injure himself. Tell him to be careful not to injure himself. Tell him to be careful not to injure himself. Tell him to be careful not to injure himself. Tell him to be careful not to injure himself.
SPEAKER_01: He said that about this thumb, he said that this thumb exercise is actually quite good, but I know that he did not mean enormously when he performed the actions on other people. I understand.
SPEAKER_02: uh yeah he he's working out also he's time to make it like deadly you know yeah i i i really train you know but with the tennis ball with the like used tennis balls a little bit softer i really train here um can you ask him where was the shape is it better than last year
SPEAKER_00: I was wondering what happened to the Rehsos. Did you see them all together? Yes, they fought even. The other day they had a war with each other, non-stop.
SPEAKER_00: and next time we see and when rivers is coming to istanbul upcoming match uh you need to have the uh not one door but create the other door next to it because he cannot fit inside so he's really big yeah yeah he's 150 kg right now he got really big 150.
SPEAKER_04: There was a guy named Rezu Makkhilatsona. He was in his 50s. I have a video of him. He was in his 50s. He was in his 50s.
SPEAKER_00: uh the uh the other day he uploaded on his channel gennady uploaded on his channel rezo's video where revas is uh doing curl 140 or 47 kg around that weight like biceps and 120 kg was revaz's limit on that exercise
SPEAKER_00: and now he's like close to one hundred twenty percent increase yeah yeah and basically that that is uh reverse his own weight right now because again he said that everyone has never been over 145 kg and last time he saw him he was 47 kg and then also he said that there was this bicep curling 147 up to so kind of his chronic his own way the question is what does he think that there was a chance against
SPEAKER_00: Dave Chaffee. Oh, what do you think? I'm sorry. I was translating. What do you think, Dave? What do you think?
SPEAKER_04: There was a chance that I would be able to do it. The way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt, the way I felt
SPEAKER_04: It's not in the same form, for example, in the form of Metskhoye and Ukete, and I think that if you look at it, you can see the difference between the two. But Metsmumatebuli is in the form of Metskhoye and Metskhoye is in the form of Metskhoye. It's very interesting.
SPEAKER_00: so uh he said that last time when you asked the same question when we were all together yeah he said 50 50 back then now he's going close to 60 for reverse and the reason he's saying that is that from his match from gennady's match against dave chafee the shape gennady was back then right now would lose against results there was this current shape
SPEAKER_00: But since then, Gennady also gained and got better and stronger. He now is like on tie. So he said that me and Revas are same. Yeah, they really had a tough war against each other. So he said that Revas right now is nothing less than me. But since I know that I progressed from Dave Chaffee's match, he knows that that version of Gennady would lose against this Revas that currently he is sparring.
SPEAKER_00: But he also said that obviously everything is good, but the most important thing is that Rewaz should be able to deliver his current shape, as we speak, deliver to the table when it's only matters, you know. So as long as Rewaz manages to deliver what he has right now, he thinks 60 to 40% now Rewaz is favorite. So basically Rewaz is stronger than the time that
SPEAKER_00: he lost against morozov yeah for sure yes yes he he said that uh yeah okay i will re-ask him
SPEAKER_04: In this way, the big fans came together and this was a very big event for Revaz. I can only say that Revaz did not have a very big competition with these fans. Revaz did not compete with the big fans. Revaz won the tournament in Ziritadivarji and won the tournament in Bagirze. To compete with these fans in this professional sport, Revaz was a great sportsman. He was a great athlete, but he lost.
SPEAKER_00: So Revas' mistake what occurred against Morozo was that preparation like one week before the match Revas did very extremely heavy weight lifting and that was the mistake and he did not have enough time to rest so basically resting was not enough and
SPEAKER_00: Usually Rivas is not doing such a heavyweight pulling and Rivas is not used to do that. So he's not kind of experienced about that. And right now, as he gets better and better, Rivas gets better and better, he also kind of threatens to entire Georgian crew who spars with him.
SPEAKER_00: because he's getting better at weightlifting now he's getting more experience he knows what to do better than previously and Revas used to be lazy or lazier uh athlete than he is now he got even more motivated since he's versus West and that's why he thinks that Revas is gonna be for sure in better shape this time than last time we saw him I guess another question like to all the strongest
SPEAKER_02: super heavyweights are Gennady and Rewas. The question, just a question, I know they are friends, they don't want to say anything that would disturb each other, but to them, to their understanding, is Levan unreachable for their minds, for themselves?
SPEAKER_00: It is interesting to note that Sheno and Revazio are the same, because the two titans in these superzones are very similar.
SPEAKER_04: And how do you think you can help Lebanon? How do you think you can work with Lebanon? I don't know exactly. I don't know how to work with Lebanon. I don't know how to work with Lebanon. I don't know how to work with Lebanon. I don't know how to work with Lebanon. I don't know how to work with Lebanon. I don't know how to work with Lebanon.
SPEAKER_04: I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to
SPEAKER_00: So he can only speak about himself and not from Reva's perspective. So that question only he answers from his side. Reva can obviously tell his side in future.
SPEAKER_00: So he's saying that, and he kept always saying, Gennady kept always saying about him versus Levan, that Levan is not that much unreachable for him personally. He knows how to beat him. But since they are very good friends with each other, he first of all respects, he's his countryman, he's his good friend. He has reached so much higher level in this sport. He's a leader, true leader right now all around.
SPEAKER_00: And he has nothing but respect as an athlete to athlete about that one. And then as they are friends, it is awkward for Gennady to claim that he can beat Levan. But he's saying that if he gets six months, let's say, give it or take, six months of preparation for Levan, he thinks that he could beat Levan if everything is perfect.
SPEAKER_00: okay so he said that levan is eventually beatable because everybody is beatable no one is unbeatable everyone has at some point what type of some some weakest links you know so yeah but but right now he cannot say it it's awkward he he knows it's not right to say that he can beat levan he says that basically levan is the best right now but there is no reason that he shouldn't believe in himself against anyone
SPEAKER_00: is this what you're saying yes yeah but personally if he if kennedy has good enough time six months let's say he gives himself as chance against leon as well yeah there is another super chat digging digging it's all gonna be he said that if if i beat them if i beat them on larat
SPEAKER_02: Oh, actually, he didn't say if. I have to correct myself. He said, when I beat Devon Larratt, set me up the match against Levan. I will show. We will go one by one. I just wanted to see how they think. Like, psychologically, oh, it's Levan. No, we cannot beat him. Or they really believe that there is a possibility for them to reach to the top. So he is saying that after he beats Devon, he doesn't even say if.
SPEAKER_00: So this guy really believes that May 6th will be probably the end of Devon's dream to become a super heavyweight world champion.
SPEAKER_00: Devon said that he would never go heavier than 115 kg, but then he also kind of said that, well, he can still try himself against Revas, but...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Tevo should not pull Georgians because outcome will be all the time the same. Just try to find some other opponents. I understand. There is a question. Dig in, dig in it. Thank you for your support. For Gennady, have you improved since your Hermes battle? Sorry, Engin. I was reading the chat. He's asking that if Gennady improved since his Hermes match.
SPEAKER_04: How did you and Hermes meet? No, it's not your turn. It was my first meeting with you, right?
SPEAKER_04: I don't think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition. I think it's a bad thing that I didn't participate in the competition.
SPEAKER_00: These two shapes, like Gennady's current shape and Gennady's shape versus Nermes is practically incomparable because the gap is significant, very big. Right now, Gennady is way stronger, better.
SPEAKER_00: than he was against Hermes. And he said that, I'm not going to say I was not in shape against Hermes. Obviously I was, I was prepared. He said, the only issue he said that possibly it was that he got like only four days rest time, but that's like possible. Some people get more or less, but he said that he was in good shape against Hermes, but he lost.
SPEAKER_00: And this time, it's incomparable because his current shape, even from Ferit's match, he versus Ferit, so in January, he's got even better right now as we speak. So, incomparable shapes. Yeah, there is another super chat. Thank you, my friend, for your super chat. Will you be afraid since Devon is so much taller than you, like Grevas? Also, what should Devon be worried about from you?
SPEAKER_00: What is your best weapon that you will prove to him in the match? Like first question you ask, maybe let's go one by one. Okay. Is he gonna be afraid that Devon is much taller than him? Gena, I would like to say that Genadio, as you said, is older than Devon. He is older than Devon.
SPEAKER_04: He's going to shorten them, shorten him.
SPEAKER_00: ah he brought his uh example uh with the reverse he said that when i when we me and devon put arms like this like elbow pad and like this maybe like like like this or maybe even he's saying that maybe not even uh that much taller because he versus rivers is quite saying that's what he said yeah i understand yeah another question is what should devon
SPEAKER_04: I'm worried about Gennady. Do you think you're going to be angry and nervous about Devon? If you're going to talk about Devon. No, I'm not going to be angry. I'm going to be angry with you. What are you going to do? What am I going to do? I'm going to make a deal with you. I'm going to make a deal with you.
SPEAKER_04: I was born in the mid-1980s, and I was born in the mid-1980s. I don't have a lot of experience, but I know how to do it. I know how to do it, and I know how to do it. I don't have a lot of experience, but I know how to do it. I don't have a lot of experience, but I know how to do it. I don't have a lot of experience, but I know how to do it. I know how to do it.
SPEAKER_04: The ball is our technique, the ball is our technique, the ball is our technique. For example, Michael Dodi is here, Kingsmoos is here, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on,
SPEAKER_00: So he said that basically Devon should be worried about everything that Gennady could be delivering against him. But then I asked him, come on, give me some more specific answers. And he said that first of all, Devon is slower than I am. That's what Gennady said. So speed. Second of all, I'm stronger than him. That's okay. Speed and strength. Then he also said that the surges, these heats that I can do, that's also...
SPEAKER_00: He's doing that better than Devon can do. So these are three. He also said that endurance, we are quite same. He said that he did not say that I'm better or something like that. He said that endurance wise, we could be same. But since I'm stronger, he knows he's stronger. He assumes that who gets tired, if the endurance is same and I'm stronger, obviously Devon will get tired sooner than I am. That's what he said.
SPEAKER_00: And another thing, he also brought the example of Michael Todd. He said that Devon has never pulled such a versatile armwrestler like I am. And he said that he, Gennady himself, is no any less technical as Devon. And he said that I can pull in every position possible. That's what Gennady said. And he repeated himself.
SPEAKER_00: uh like against michael todd devon and mike they both were in king's move and they were resting in there staying in there and eventually somebody got so tired and the other one won but he said that i'm not michael todd has never faced anyone like uh me because i'm as strong and as versatile as i am gennady's devon's opponent has never been such as such an opponent for devon so
SPEAKER_02: uh that's those are four things major things that they should be worried about so i understand arm wrestling experiment thank you for your support why doesn't gennady train with levan they are number one and number two of georgia after all also is your instagram account john engen yes my friend thanks i thank you for your support so he is asking
SPEAKER_00: They are the two best guys in Georgia. Why did they not train together? Him and Lewan, right? Gena, what do you and Lewan have to say about each other? What do you think about sparring? It's a very important moment.
SPEAKER_04: I know that this is my private business, this is my private business, and I would like to say that I am very happy to be here with you. I am very happy to be here with you. I am very happy to be here with you. I am very happy to be here with you. I am very happy to be here with you.
SPEAKER_04: That's how it started. I didn't want to go to war. I wanted to go to war with my friends. I wanted to go to war with my friends. I didn't want to go to war with my friends. I didn't want to go to war with my friends. I didn't want to go to war with my friends. I didn't want to go to war with my friends.
SPEAKER_00: uh main reason he said uh why he and levan cannot uh do table time sparring each other is that
SPEAKER_00: the time uh arrangements he said that uh lebanon is basically concentrated on armless link and i have some other businesses he already mentioned several times today's live stream and i have some other uh like things to take care of during the daytime and what leon is doing during the data daytime is that basically he is training and he just said that right now after after this live stream is done he's about to go train gennady but right now as we speak lebanon is already done training
SPEAKER_00: so that's the reason why he cannot train with uh and he said that but sleeping time he has enough sleep because he sleeps he wakes up quite late like 11 a.m or so and so sleeping is okay but he has such a tired schedule for training that's why i understand uh okay this guy is asking devon has bigger hands would it affect gennady
SPEAKER_02: uh okay okay i mean normally normally i mean he even pull against levan before i don't think that the size of devon's hand will be something like new for uh all right
SPEAKER_00: Gena, in general, it is very difficult. It is not very difficult, but sometimes it is very difficult, Gena, and sometimes it is not comfortable, and sometimes it is difficult. And I think that... Well, Levan Saginashvili is very difficult, because Levan Saginashvili was my competitor, and I was in the same class with him.
SPEAKER_04: As a matter of fact, I don't know what it means. I don't know what it means. I don't know what it means. I don't know what it means. I don't know what it means.
SPEAKER_04: When I translated and I also started to translate what you said about him versus Levan,
SPEAKER_00: he actually kind of interrupted and said himself that he finished my words so he said that throughout the history we all know he has faced lebanon and lebanon's hand the devil's hand is uh not as big as lebanon's obviously and he said that uh during his entire career
SPEAKER_00: if he has any, any concurrent and like opponent at his level in armwrestling, all of them has relatively bigger hands than Gennady himself. So he got used to train against armwrestling against such bigger hands. And he said that also, the bigger hand is the more technical wise, you can perform against them even more.
SPEAKER_02: and he said that if hand is smaller you cannot perform so much technique actions on those so he's he feels quite comfortable yeah yeah and now we're closing before we close i would like to ask him what does he think about east versus west as an event in general right i mean what does he think you know like generally
SPEAKER_00: Gena, thank you very much for your time. Thank you very much for your interest. What do you think about East vs. West? What do you think will happen in this event? First of all, I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be part of the group of new artists and to be part of the group of new artists.
SPEAKER_00: First of all, Enkin, you are doing an amazing job. What you are doing and what you have done to give birth to such an event as East versus West, it is very effective in my country. I mean, in Georgia, he said that more and more young people are
SPEAKER_00: have gotten interested into the sport and joined the club so he just wanted me to translate this and then he will carry on so your what you have done popularized the event way more gandhal again uh
SPEAKER_04: and the accent is very clear, and it is very clear, because this is, let's say, the first interest of many people, and the people love it. This is a very large population of Klausidiství, and this is a very large part of Klausidiství, a very large part of Klausidiství, let's say, this interest is present.
SPEAKER_04: I would like to thank Engini, Klavchidi, Zoga, sportsmen, and Tavish for this opportunity. It's a great show and sport is a very important part of the country.
SPEAKER_04: I was very impressed by this, because I, as a young man, am a sportsman, and I know that there is no doubt about it. There are people with disabilities, with disabilities, with disabilities, with disabilities,
SPEAKER_04: This is why our popularity is so high. This tournament is popular all over the world. From here, you can go to the center of all sports. This is very important. And this movement continues. From our point of view, the most important thing is that all sportsmen are involved.
SPEAKER_00: and his second part of his answer was based on his first answer that first part that he said that it got more popular and more so much more people are recognizing this event and from this event got aware of the sport as it is arm wrestling and so much more people are asking him personally if he is preparing who is against uh with next time and everybody are involved in this sport
SPEAKER_00: from this event and he said that other than popularization generally speaking and in future long term speaking this is extremely uh great uh for armwrestling itself because it takes into the uh levels that has honestly never been before he said that it is very hard to have a elite uh event and also entertaining and uh
SPEAKER_00: again you managed to do this and he thanked you for that one he also said that so many so many matches that are within the one event makes it even more exciting you know one match is interesting then the other comes it is very interesting and so on and so forth it continues so it it is very extremely interesting as so much matches to you you have on during the one event he also said that uh
SPEAKER_00: um this elite level also has never been reached because pop top guys are from all over the world and right now today gennady is very proud to say that he is arm wrestling arm wrestler because whatever he says about that that's my goal my friend that's my goal he just
SPEAKER_00: yeah whenever he's he he said that i'm very proud to be arm wrestler because wherever i say i'm arm wrestler everybody talks about this versus quest in my country everybody recognizes that and more people joined arm wrestling and he said that you keep up the good job and this will uh bring the sport in the level that it truly deserves yeah tell him that those are our superstars and they deserve much better than this
SPEAKER_00: Gena, I would like to say that this is my opinion, and my opinion is that you are a Georgian and you are a native, and you know very well that you are going to lose weight, and you will be able to do this sport as much as possible.
SPEAKER_04: It is a big challenge, and from our point of view, I would like to say that this is my private business, and I am very happy that I was able to come here and open two stores.
SPEAKER_04: This is my exclusive video of Trekking Trash, and I have my own video of it. This is the first time I've seen it, and I've never seen it before, but it's not a big deal. I've never seen a video like this before. I've never seen it before. I've never seen it before. I've never seen it before. I've never seen it before. I've never seen it before. I've never seen it before. I've never seen it before.
SPEAKER_04: From our point of view, all sportsmen are active, not just me, Deon, Rewaz, and so on. All of them are active because this person is a real example of what can be done and we are the first to know if we are active in sports.
SPEAKER_04: All the sportsmen were active and all the participants were the same. If you watch our videos, you will see that it is very short and you will see Klaus Chidistu's face and what he did. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same. All the participants were the same.
SPEAKER_00: All right. He also thanked you for your words that you said. And he said that from our perspective as armistice lawyers,
SPEAKER_00: we will do as much as we possibly can to uh get this also very popular promote it and also help armisting to grow and reach bigger levels he said that personally as of right now he had like some last 10 days had some personal uh things to take care of but right now he tells his fans he's telling people who are watching us right now guys uh be ready that uh and gennady will upload
SPEAKER_00: uh constantly videos on his channel about his preparation versus them just wanted to make uh wanted me to tell he tell you this uh and he then he started to talk to the audience from arm wrestling arm wrestler arm wrestler audience that are watching us right now he said that every arm wrestler who is uh having a common sense
SPEAKER_00: to be promoting this sport and helping you, Engin, because this, what we are doing, we are doing it together. Engin is not only one guy in this sport. Engin needs people who are also sharing the same mind. And he said that the reason why I'm saying this is because this is good for us. That's what Gennady said, good for us armwrestlers as well. That's why he mentioned these words TORS to armwrestlers.
SPEAKER_00: uh other competitors as well so they all need to get together and promote this event share videos upload videos re-share them and get it more and more going this action and then also he said the same thing to fans as well whoever you if you are his fan cannot be spent Devon's fan or all around arm wrestling fan you should be doing the same promote share and uh keep the sport grow

SPEAKER_00: What does this mean, how does it work? It means that we are going to have a meeting on the 6th of May and we are going to have a discussion. How does this work and what does it mean to you? Let's see.
SPEAKER_04: Well, the principle is the same as mine and Deon's, because there are so many people, for example, in Deon's book, who say that I have a chance, that I am going to win this time. I don't think so, because I don't have a chance. I had this from my childhood, and I always thought that I was going to win this time. And I am going to win this time, and this is going to happen to my Georgia,
SPEAKER_04: As you can see, my contribution to Georgia is a symbol of the fact that Georgia is no longer with us. All of this is the result of my commitment to the people. I was not able to do it with Klavchid, but Klavchid is everything to me. With Klavchid, I was able to say that this is what I want, this is what I want, and this is what I want. My contribution to the country.
SPEAKER_04: It is clear that I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it because I will not be able to do it
SPEAKER_00: uh he started by saying that personally this victory that he will bring back to home will mean everything for him and for his country it will be one big step towards to the greatness he said that for him armis link has never been the source of to become a reach or to become a material wealth
SPEAKER_00: uh this is the feeling that he has from this sport that drives him motivates him and keeps him uh focused on get out there bring the bring the flag of his country put it there and said that this is where i'm coming from this is my country and this is how good we are so he as a patriot uh um said that it means everything for him to go out there and win against devon
SPEAKER_00: and when he comes back for his people around him and from georgians it he knows that it would mean also a lot and it would be a very big step towards to the uh uh greater um future yeah basically that's what he said very very important for him basically my friends thank you very much i wish you good luck
SPEAKER_02: Devon is also my friend. I wish him good luck too. Engin, you will see what his arm will do. He said thank you and he will prove this arm to you. Wow. I think he's just coming there without any doubt that he's going to win. While Devon also feels that way, it will be, how do you say, a clash of titans? Wow. It will be. Mentally,
SPEAKER_02: two very very strong guys spiritually their heart very very strong they both are probably the most versatile arm masters on the earth i just can't imagine what's going to happen on the table wow i don't know how you managed to set this up but yeah i mean yeah i will set it up i will set it up as long as as long as you are missing sports
SPEAKER_02: I will continue setting up and I will just focus on arm wrestling, nothing else. Thank you, thank you, thank you Gennady and thank you Roman, my friend. See you in Istanbul.
