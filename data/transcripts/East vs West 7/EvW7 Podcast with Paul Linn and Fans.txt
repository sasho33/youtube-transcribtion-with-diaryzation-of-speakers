SPEAKER_04: you know two years taking it seriously found the club here through armbet you know uh thanks to devin larry yeah yeah i think that that i think devin devin created that one right yes yeah so that i think helped a lot
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely. And then found out who was near me, got onto a club and started pulling. And yeah, I mean, obviously North Carolina has really been killing it lately. You are very well familiarized with one of our guys, Adam Orsinski.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah. Yeah. The guy is just like, whoa, whoa. Yeah. The guy is very strong. So, and then we have an old legendary puller, too. His name is Paul Walther. He's... Yeah. Yeah, so... He used to have about, like, 242 pullers. He used to have many final matches against Jerry Calderet, but usually he ended up taking... He was a top roller, and Jerry was going like this. I remember in the late 90s, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Paul's been pulling for awhile. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's probably. Like has been in this sport as long as I have been. I don't know. Maybe even before me. I I don't know.

SPEAKER_03: arm wrestling are you an arm master or just fan it looks like you are training i can't see those shoulders and everything yeah bless you brother thank you i've trained for about 10 years now of my life um just in the gym and that but for six years i've been on arm wrestling my older brother is a fanatic in training and he loves strength
SPEAKER_03: and um we got into arm wrestling with because of devon larat suplenkov and it was around six years ago and we've watched all the videos and to be honest it's the best strength sport in the world i love all strength sports i watch strongman every year i don't really watch bodybuildings it's not strength so but i watch all strength sports olympics um any gymnastics calisthenics strength and arm wrestling is just the best test of real strength
SPEAKER_03: And in my family, we love it. We're Italian and Spanish. We really like Gasparini. We love it, mate. Arm wrestling, there's everything. I've got a little bit of an arm there, but I love all the arm wrestlers because they're what I want to be like. They're the athletes. Like you always say, Engine, everything is about the athletes. They're the people I love in this. The sport is all about them. People like you, Pauline, Siplenkov, Levan, all of them.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah and and uh paul did you like this you know to get together with fans is good huh i love it i love it because i mean i love the platform youtube brings especially with the lives where people can have live commentary but the idea of actually interacting and you know real time asking your questions with your voice is just a one step closer
SPEAKER_01: And at the end of the day, you guys that are supporting us, you guys really are funding and pushing the sport forward. Yes. We're an organization, but without the people that actually care to watch, we have nothing. Thank you. What's your last name, Marco? Collie, C-O-L-L-I. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Does it say something there different? Just says Marco. What do you mean?
SPEAKER_03: oh no i thought he said something different there no my surname is collie it means um a little mountain in italian you said collie collie yeah okay yeah yeah and and ted who is your favorite honest sir uh you know it's got to be devin larry there's different weight classes there's different weight classes brother there's uh there's too many to pick from but
SPEAKER_03: You know, Paul Lynn, for me, is one of my favourites, even though he's new, in my opinion, to arm wrestling. He's such a good personality. I love Todd Hutchings. I love a lot of the original people, but all different weights have their own athletes that I love. If I have to put down to one, I would say Denis Suplenkov, because I love the gentle giant, how he is and his hands and everything he brings to the sport. It's just unbelievable.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah i agree they they the giant guy can be a monster but at the same time so gentle to take time to love cats and dogs and and and ted ted yeah how about you you said devon ladd right yeah so so devin would definitely be my my favorite um as far as north american guys would be devin then john then paul believe it or not i love paul um i know he's new how can you not love
SPEAKER_00: i yeah i love paul the white orc is just amazing uh but as far as eastern guys um i definitely love uh people like um um uh kodecha and uh one of my favorites is yannis amalis i just love
SPEAKER_00: I just absolutely love his hand control and the way he does it. And who couldn't love Coach Ray? I mean, come on. But but again, to be honest, I had to do a lot of catching up on you because I'm more of a super match fan. And when I watched you in a tournament scene, I was just blown away by just your drive and your and your willingness to just put it all out there. So hats off, man. Like you're as far as tournament as far as tournament, you're one of the best used to be good. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And, you know, Manolo's in the chat asked an interesting question to play off of that. Who is your least favorite arm wrestlers? If you go there, if you go there, you know, we will be haters. Yeah, there's got to be villains and heroes. Yeah. Let's talk about the things that we like, you know? Yeah, yeah. Much better. Yeah, it's always better. And
SPEAKER_03: marco have you ever completed any events no no no do you plan do you plan do you know what mate i'm going to tell you the truth to be an athlete you have to be obsessed with the sport as in time i have two children i have a job
SPEAKER_03: I'm limited to my time. I admire the athletes. That's why I admire it so much because for me to give up everything and do what they do is just, it's unbelievable. When I was young, I'm not saying I'm old because I'm not, I'm 33, but when I was younger, I would have been dedicated to the sport much more and I was much bigger and much stronger, but
SPEAKER_03: As I've grown up, I've just had to watch it more and love it from the sidelines. And that's what's happened to me. So, no, I don't compete, but I just love watching. It's just everything to watch it, mate. And you, Ted?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I've had some super matches in the last two years. I've been to two different tournaments. I'm going to be going to Carolina Carnage the beginning of June, and I'm going to be going to the North Carolina State Championships the end of August. And, you know, I don't know how I'll do at those big ones, but, you know, we're going to give it a shot. I'm dropping weight. I'm pretty proud of the fact that arm wrestling has given me a chance to turn my life around. November 8th,
SPEAKER_00: of last year so only about what four or five months ago i was 270 pounds and very very out of shape and you know fatty liver disease and the whole nine and uh now i'm 235 as i said here today and uh i'm stronger i'm faster um definitely healthier yeah definitely healthier so uh and i'm on my way down to about the 220 to 210 mark and uh we'll see where i we'll see where i go after that
SPEAKER_00: but uh but yeah man uh just just doing the small stuff the local stuff uh if i had found it 20 years ago my goal would be to be on a stage with you you know but yeah but uh that's not gonna happen but i'm okay i'll pay for the pay-per-view yeah yeah yeah yeah and how how old were you when you found it ted i'm 43 now i found it when i was 41. guess what buddy i'm 42. yeah well
SPEAKER_04: I found it at basically 36, 35, 36. You got time. Well, hey, you never know, right? One of these days, maybe. One of these days. Paul, do you follow the chat that Sean wrote about you? Yeah. I'm going to reply back to him. Yeah. You are his least favorite. You are awesome. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: All in for presidents, GB19 says. Yeah. The Carolina Carnage tournament's a big one, man. That's the one I was hoping to get to a couple years back. That's a good one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Mike Bianchi is putting that on and, and it's just, yeah, he's, he's a, he's a, just a sick polar himself. And, and, uh, you know, I had to represent, you know, Carolina rollers. I've, I've talked to you before, Paul, um, you know, I've, I've interviewed you last year. I don't know if you remember with, uh, a guy named Donnie and, and, uh, and, and stuff like that, but yeah, we had a lot of fun. Yeah. Paul, how is the preparation?
SPEAKER_01: good good i mean i i got to go and do some really good after pulling at the big winter blast tournament with huge huge tournament a lot of super heavyweights i pulled until about 3 34 in the morning i feel really good no no aches and pains and i got some good horsepower on my arm so yeah yeah yeah i think it you know of course it's not my business but you need to focus on more on specific
SPEAKER_04: pulling instead of a lot of guys, just my opinion. It's not my business, it's not my place, but your opponent would be great if you would be training with Dave Chaffee, if he would control you and you would be just applying as much as you want. Of course, he's stronger, but if he doesn't beat you and controls you, that kind of pressure that you will have probably more than
SPEAKER_01: you know, your next opponent, you know, yeah. I'm hoping to be able to, like, Rob and I are going to set something up in New York. We're hoping to be able to get JP out there. It's just tricky because Dave's about five hours from me. How about Jerry? Jerry's closer to you? No, Jerry's further. Jerry's further up. Oh, okay. But we're trying to get everybody together at the New York qualifier and maybe one other time with Rob. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: let's see how it will be let's see it will be like the qualifiers i think that will be very tough one i don't know who will be when is the california qualifier today or next week i think next week i'm losing i think it's next week i think it's next week yeah okay okay anyway so marco what do you want to see
SPEAKER_04: in armwrestling world more than like what we have or different than what we have as a fan what would you wish thank you i think we may not be able to we may not be able to do every week coming reality but i would like to hear at least you know if something we can do or not yeah i'm not i'm not i'm telling the honest truth here i think engine you've done the best thing king of the table and east versus west is what we really needed
SPEAKER_03: um when you look back it was all tournaments i mean the wal done well but the wal was more of a show-off thing in my opinion more of a
SPEAKER_03: just to get entertainment. But for me, East and West is very serious. It's real after, it's king of the table. It's very, I think this is what we need in the sport, more of this, more real super matches that actually make sense to people that have made a, not a rivalry, but we know where they are and we know the strengths of people. Now we can put them together in tournaments like yours. I think this is one of the best things that's happened.
SPEAKER_03: I think arm wrestling is one of the also for me what I need what I want to see more is more of this you know in the world at the moment it's all becoming woke I'm sorry to say it but it is an arm wrestling isn't it's something that's very manly it's something that's very strong it's something that appeals to people like me that want the manly part of life back where we look
SPEAKER_03: where the man has to take care of things and be the strong person. And I think arm wrestling needs to show this. It needs to show what the male is and how we are and what our personalities are like and what strength is and how we respect each other. But we still have to be strong and we still have to be friendly and we still have to do what we have to do. This is how it's happening. You know, you see that, you know, those guys are, trust me, they are very serious. They are very serious. They just train so serious.
SPEAKER_04: yeah they when they go table everything is you see how intense but once the match is over everyone hugs each other they they joke with each other they eat together you know everything like this is but that moment that moment at the competition is you just can't get any more serious than what it is and you ted what are your wishes uh in our missing uh world
SPEAKER_00: To be honest, I second a lot of that. I think that WAO did pretty well. I think that the pads, I think that the 7x9 pads were a mistake. I do agree with Devin. If you're going to add it to the back, then you need to add it to the front. What you did was perfect. You added one centimeter all the way around. So if you're going to do it, do it all the way. Don't just do it in one direction because then you artificially prop up certain types of pullers.
SPEAKER_00: um you know and you make it not really unfair but you make it stacked against somebody else so east first west is definitely uh amazing king of the table is definitely amazing if wal did come back i would love to see a difference in the way they did things as far as not not so much the rule set but as far as like the pads and and stuff like that because i think all of you are migrating towards a quote unquote looser rule set because you understand that there needs to be a certain amount of
SPEAKER_00: show quality along with a certain amount of regulation to the match and that to me is the direction that it needs to go and and hats off to you guys for doing it and having the guts to do it because i know that you know the regulating systems are all like no it's got to be this way and and for you guys to kind of say we're gonna we're gonna you know kind of go a little bit looser with it but still keep the regulation there that that really took a lot of balls and and i appreciate that i really do
SPEAKER_03: Can I quickly say something there while I forget? I have to say, it's not negative what I wish we could improve on, it's how the athletes talk to the referees sometimes. So in my opinion, when I watch the sport, I don't want to see 30 minutes of arguing with the ref and saying his elbow's off. For me, that's the referee's job.
SPEAKER_03: i like watching the the arm wrestling but you know when they take half an hour to set up for me that's the only
SPEAKER_03: thing that puts me that i have to say negative about some of the matches where i can remember some like devon and brooklyn it took so long to actually start the match and that's part of the fight though can be improved on i don't know how don't get me wrong i don't know you're the people that do it but something like that i think they shouldn't be so disrespectful to the referees themselves just let them if you're strong and you're good enough you're gonna win so
SPEAKER_04: I don't see why that's such a big deal in some matches, but anything other than that is fine. I understand. Yeah, I thank you for sharing your opinion bravely. You know, it's just this is why we are here. You can do the same, any kind of criticizing directly about me too, as long as we are respectful to each other when we are sharing our opinions.
SPEAKER_04: and and do you guys have any question let's start with ted do you have any question for paul or to me whatever you guys like you guys are at this show you guys are the real guests you know so yeah
SPEAKER_00: no i appreciate that paul i would i would just kind of bounce off of what engen had said i mean you said your prep is going well and all that and and i i've talked to you a little bit online but i kind of wanted to get a face-to-face answer on this you know in your last match and we're not going to go into what happened and all that but in your last match when you committed and i saw that out of you
SPEAKER_00: you had to feel that you were finally in the match. And how did that feel to you? Because to me, just from a fan's point of view, I was on the edge of my seat screaming because I said, holy crap, this dude's got it. He's got more than enough for a world-class hook puller, and he's there. Now that he committed and put his mind behind it, it was there. So how did you feel when that happened? Obviously, we hope that he gets a speedy recovery, and we never want to see anybody injured, but...
SPEAKER_00: know how did you feel when you finally realized oh i've got a hook for this dude
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Well, when you, you know, when you, when you look at this stuff, so like, you know, especially as a newer puller, you're trying to break down like, okay, let me break down this puller, this style and what I have to do. I'm talking to all these other people looking at all the videos, you know, and when you, when you have to, when you have to have three rounds of three separate plans and the first one or two doesn't go the way you like it. Right. And it looks one sided because you're going in the worst lanes you could go.
SPEAKER_01: um it's tough to to keep to switch to the next plan you know so like all right you know the outside moves don't work and it looks one-sided um to come into the third round and say okay time to full commit to what i probably should have done in for in the first round um takes a little bit of mental fortitude to you know um but you know what once you get that stop and you feel it you know like all right now i'm here it's just
SPEAKER_01: it's uh it's tricky because i got it and i felt it and i started to surge and then it was over yeah so yeah the emotion that i'm feeling during that was like excitement and that immediate disappointment yeah you know so yeah it was cut out that that match was a huge like emotional rollercoaster for me especially afterwards so to me i just to me i just got to say man like you really do embody
SPEAKER_00: a true champion like you you are fierce fierce fighter you know there's obviously no taking a step backwards in anything you do but you also are so humble and so gracious to all of your opponents and i mean obviously you you
SPEAKER_00: you can make that opposite with somebody like Devin. I think Devin I think Devin is misrepresented because I think he you know, everybody sees the fight that he goes through, you know, to get what he wants. But see, he's a combat guy, right? That's the combat starts before you even step to the table. But anybody who's ever been around Devin knows that outside of that, he's just like you humble and and, you know, relaxed and down to earth and an amazing dude to be around. And you guys
SPEAKER_00: are the spear for arm wrestling, in my opinion, like you guys are what we all should be striving to be like. So thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you. Back to Marco's point, it was very well articulated and hopefully it didn't get missed. We live like in a society where the natural progression of this planet has been to kind of squelch out masculinity in a way or make our youth feel like this isn't that important. It's not important to be strong. It's not important to forget about what it is to be, quote unquote, a man and do manly type things.
SPEAKER_01: I think that's such a mistake. I think it's not fair to kids to change what their perceived identity could and should be, but rather what we should be doing is focused on how to do that and teach kids to be men with those good qualities too, rather than constantly focusing on the negative sides of masculinity. There's a way to go about things and being masculine is not a bad thing.
SPEAKER_01: if you do the right things with it. And Marco's right. I mean, the sport, it's such a gentleman's sport. Like, there's a lot of trash talk and stuff leading up. Of course, it's combat on the table. But, like, you're 100% right. The switch goes on and the switch goes off after the match. And for me, personally, it's a huge release. Like, if I don't have those combat, like, competitive moments, that's when the negative sides of me come out. Right. Yep. So...
SPEAKER_00: I agree with that. I agree with that wholeheartedly. I used to be an amateur fighter, so I had to do the same exact thing where, you know, you walk up and you're humble and then it's go time, you know, and, and you're right. If you don't get those releases, that's when the demons start to creep up and that's when the shadows start to, to take over the brain. So yeah, you're, you gotta be, you can ask. Yeah. If I can't go to the gym and I can't compete, like she's, she's dealt with me through football and everything. So she's known all the phases.
SPEAKER_01: um the times where i don't have competition is where you know she's like everybody thinks this guy's nice he ain't nice you know yeah it was tough my buddy had to build me a gym so i didn't go insane you know yeah and you marco any questions
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah i i'd like to say to paul in and after i'd ask engine turkey as well um to pull in i would ask as the athlete because you're here and you're the one i should ask is um basically i want to see more of you paul in in my opinion because when i look at arm wrestling i'm a big fan of youtube so i watch obviously i subscribe to engine i subscribe to devon i subscribe to true power um you know all the channels and to see people like paul in train
SPEAKER_03: and to see where he is and to become more of a fan of Paul Lim. I can't, I love Paul. I'm not saying I'm not, but there's not enough for me. I'm not saying he should do it. I'm not saying, I don't know how it should be done, but I think there isn't enough of certain athletes. And I was going to ask Paul Lim if he could,
SPEAKER_03: put some more, maybe upload some videos of you, what you do. And I know there's tournaments of yourself training, but actually see your strength and how you act and what you're like is really good to see. I'd love to see more of that in the arm wrestling because only the main characters in arm wrestling really get their channels going and see what they're like. But people like you, mate, you would have so much more fans. I'd like to see more of you, to be honest, mate.
SPEAKER_01: when i started my youtube channel years back i was just kind of documenting my process it was terrible you know and then i switched to focus towards training because i you know as a younger arm wrestler that like newer i wanted to be able to like share the things that i didn't know early so if you go back in my channel i have a bunch a ton a metric ton of training stuff same same as my instagram the problem that i'm facing right now
SPEAKER_01: Not problem, but, you know, with going to East versus West and really having like a focal point now, not jumping to tournaments, but having these specific games that I'm training for, it's made it like my training sessions are so full now. And it's tough for me to capture those things and like shoot like a decent quality video and actually get my work out.
SPEAKER_01: um but yeah i've had a couple people request some more training videos which i'm going to do my best to get some hopefully in this preparation for the sasho match but if you if you haven't seen some of the stuff my instagram and youtube if you go through it it's there's all kind of crazy stuff and you can see how dumb i was early you know some things out
SPEAKER_03: yeah well that's just like anyone mate you ain't different there everyone starts somewhere so yeah that's brilliant it's trial and error what about your faith paul are you a god are you a god man
SPEAKER_03: you believe in god absolutely very spiritual that's another thing about the sport i really like uh everyone seems to have a moral um thing about and when you were talking there to ted about the masculine i don't even see it as there is a negativity to masculine they want us to think there is in my opinion but there isn't to be strong is the way to look after your family if you're weak you can't um if your mind is weak you can't look after your wife when you're in a problem or
SPEAKER_03: You always have to be strong as a man. It doesn't matter what situation it is, even if you have to be strong and walk away, it's still a strength to do that. There's no weakness in a real man. And when you believe in God, in my opinion, God has blessed us to be men. There's something to be grateful about to that.
SPEAKER_03: in my opinion, is actually an offence to God, to the Almighty, why we would do that. And God is in all of us, so we're just disrespecting ourselves if we disrespect who we are. So, as a man, I think even if you're not genetically blessed, people say these things,
SPEAKER_03: But at the end of the day, you can always be strong and being strong is down to effort. It's down to even if you lose your next match, I'm not saying you will. It's about being as strong as you can because that's what arm wrestling is all about. And I wanted to say, Paul, that led to my last question.
SPEAKER_03: I believe that Sasho in my opinion I follow arm wrestling a lot mate so I've watched all your matches and for me Sasho is going to be the hardest match I'm talking about east and west because I know you've won them all I'm not talking about I know you've lost certain matches but to me they were different style this is professional east and west and I think
SPEAKER_03: this is going to be very hard. I've watched Sasho a lot and he's, he's no joker. Do you know what I mean? He's such a speed, um, power athlete and, um, short stroke quick. And I think you need to be prepared, bro. You need to be ready for this because I want you to win. To be honest, Ted was saying he respects all the Eastern Europeans and I do make my favorites, Dennis, I love them. But for some reason I always want the America, the West, because obviously I'm,
SPEAKER_01: from the way it's someone I back. So I really want you to win, mate. You're doing really well and keep going, bro. Just you really got to do this because after this, I don't think you'll have many competitors, mate, because he's one of the best. So. So, yeah, you're you're you're spot on and he poses a unique style. So I'm doing my best to, you know, formulate a game plan and train specifically for that. So in my mind, I'm like,
SPEAKER_01: and like how you look at the things like there's things that are physical strength there's things that are mental strength but when i look at this i'm not competing i guess against sasha andrea i'm i'm competing against this guy so what do i do for these next weeks how do i push myself harder how do i eat cleaner how do i sleep better i need to bring the best version of me if i beat myself in preparation i'll leave it all on the table and be at peace with whatever happens
SPEAKER_04: so that's the only way you will be the winner as long as you do your preparation as best as good as possible and you perform at the table mentally spiritually physically as good as possible
SPEAKER_04: yeah the results trust me is the not the most important thing because you did your best and this guy your opponent will do his best one needs to win there cannot be two winners in one minute so you are only responsible to do so you will not have any regret that oh i should have done you know i should have
SPEAKER_04: I should have slept better. I should have trained better. I should be more brave. I should just believe more. I should do this. I should do that. As long as you don't have any regrets with your own preparation, everything is okay. There is no human being on this earth that his hand didn't come to the pin path. You know, there is no one that who just pronated it in turn, whose wrist wasn't bent. Who is this, you know,
SPEAKER_04: arm wasn't just open like this you know every human being tasted that feeling so just
SPEAKER_01: i'm so i'm so thankful for this match because it is as challenging as it is right yeah for the people that don't know like like the people that maybe you know haven't dug in from the from from out here in the west and don't know and think that i'm the favorite like no no but i'm thankful because it gives me another opportunity to push myself a little bit further if it were if i'm the favorite
SPEAKER_03: can i mentally generate you know the capacity needed to go hard enough to be a better version you haven't lost a match in east and west so in east and west you're the favorite but in what just from watching sasho before i've seen him beat some big big people like he is over strong for what he is i don't know if you're the favorite engine would know them things probably better but definitely not
SPEAKER_03: in my opinion your confidence should be very high you've never lost in eastern west you're the king there mate he needs to be in fear of you you need to show that confidence for sure
SPEAKER_00: yeah i don't want him to be scared of me i want him to be sitting on the couch right now drinking a beer exactly exactly exactly who cares about paul let me just let me just kick back and drink a beer yeah yeah exactly on the weekends paul's over there just repping out two a days and no no drink a beer sasha just go back drink a beer you're good five minutes ago
SPEAKER_04: uh pauline just left the seat and come back yeah he was he was yeah he was training we all work on this devin style yeah hey hey there you go yeah yeah yeah that's great like just trust me human being human beings
SPEAKER_04: They will not force themselves to their limits if they are not challenged. That is a fact. You need to be challenged. And if you are challenged, if there is a bigger goal, trust me, you will not get any better if there are a group of people that you compete all the time and you are much better than them. You will never get any better. You don't need to. You are better. What can you do more?
SPEAKER_04: So that is why I will tell you guys that American arm wrestling compared to 30 years ago, especially under light heavyweight category, went down about the level. This is a fact. No need to get offended because they did not have the competition with the rest of the world.
SPEAKER_04: I said this many times, professional armwrestling was all about this super heavy weights, mostly, and maybe some heavy weights. So when it is like this, they did not have enough offer to be part of the international competition, which is very high level. But the guys from Eastern nations wore armwrestling
SPEAKER_04: championships european championships that competition really really made them high level because they go pull each other they learn something go back train train train come back and then every year they just get like crazy level it's not because
SPEAKER_04: north americans are like lightweights or the heavyweights any weaker human beings than this ones but they were not part of the competition that that is the thing while the super heavyweights from north america had offers you know because it's professional because people only watch the super heavyweights so professional offers so they they had they have been kind of part of this competition but now after the east versus west we will try to bring even more
SPEAKER_04: And the more they see the challenge, the more they will force themselves. This is what I believe. I don't know if you agree or not.
SPEAKER_00: all ships rise in the tide and you're exactly right i mean you really are you you're uh we we we got we got lazy we we got lazy and now the competition is telling us that uh we're paying for it so we are we're rising to the challenge so there's no there's no offense there hanging at all because i think you're spot on i think you're just trying to be helpful you know i'm just yeah because if you think that there is
SPEAKER_04: no problem everything is okay trust me you will never get better you need to first admit that there is something going wrong we need to fix this we need to find the reason and then we need to do whatever necessary and then everything will be fine you see you know douglas came on adam worzinski came on you know it's getting better and better you know adam worzinski was like even from his first event yeah like one but he is yeah he's incredible but paul i don't know
SPEAKER_04: uh my opinion i think paul since he competed the first time here paul got better and better yeah just absolutely absolutely no better you know but um so it is i can say that it's helping
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, back to what we talked about with WAL and everything. I'm a big supporter of WAL. I enjoyed that. But the big knock on it was we were getting the best from the West. We were getting to test ourselves against the guys that we could go see in a local tournament too. I mean, the production was great, but we never got the opportunity to measure ourselves against the best in the world. So this is the opportunity to do that.
SPEAKER_01: But in reality, to what Engin's saying, it's not comfortable, you know, taking a match, you know, everybody thinks you're going to lose and then listening to all the comments from all over the world telling you can't do it. And then getting on a plane for 14 hours and then, you know, cutting weight. It's very, it's extremely uncomfortable, but there's no growth without uncomfortability. If you don't welcome in those challenges, how do you ever expect to get better? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: West has leveled me up, not only as a puller, but as a competitor and as a person. Is it, you know, is it all sunshine and rainbows? No. But at the end of the day, I'm becoming a better person. So I'm thankful. I think that being too comfortable is the enemy of a man, you know. It is. Comfort just makes you relax and you don't push your limits. Makes you lazy, makes you fat, makes you unwell.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's one step towards the grave. That's why people retire. And then from their job that there was their passion their whole life. And a year later, you find out they passed away. Yeah, it's the same thing with like soldiers or fighters or anything like that, like guys that are super physically active, you know, and they have to be for their jobs. And, you know, of course, they have to be like we're talking about, you know, men, they have to be alpha men.
SPEAKER_00: and then as soon as they as soon as they no longer have to be anymore you know they get comfortable and and you know a lot of ways they've earned it so i'm not going to say they haven't but i'm just saying at that point in a lot of ways they they get lazy and they get comfortable and the next thing you know they look like i did in november so yeah it's it's it's not good it's not good sit down look at them
SPEAKER_00: yeah if you don't mind engen i i do have one question because i'm gonna have to get rolling here pretty soon because uh i gotta go to work but uh um my question is is do you ever see yourself doing an east first west maybe more um you know maybe in america you know like a los vegas or something like that i would do that and paul we talk about it yeah we can do this
SPEAKER_04: um because i would love to see that personally like i don't travel but i would i would get out to las vegas to see that yeah i mean i mean yeah we can do we have been talking with paul you know i mean we can do that but we need to calculate everything very good right so angie let's let's talk quick about what your what your concerns are like the difference between cost at you know in istanbul and and the united states and the team team you know just like here
SPEAKER_04: like an experienced team you know just doing everything you understand and like me too go somewhere even like when we talk about las vegas none of us is from vegas you understand that everything needs to be done there we don't have an experienced team over there that will just
SPEAKER_04: don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about only organizing an event, I'm talking about production. Yeah, so not exactly the same thing. I'm sure we can do that too, but we need to make sure that everything is okay. And the second thing, we need to make sure that, as you said, the cost of the event will not be at some level that we cannot
SPEAKER_01: color yeah right so I guess you know like like you know this this could who knows if this is ever going to come to fruition but if it's going to I would kind of you know uh reach out to the arm wrestling community um and DM me if you know like if you know a really good production crew or you have a line somebody in your warm market or you want to be involved in this effort maybe sponsor us or something
SPEAKER_01: i'm not the type of guy that goes and chases sponsors but this is a huge opportunity if you're you're a fan of the sport and you know somebody who's in the production world or you have a line you know more than i know please shoot me a dm and and give us some ideas and we'll keep seeing what we can see but i think that would be awesome i thought i thought you were going to ask when angin is going to be
SPEAKER_00: Well, no, I do. Yeah, I want to see Engen back on the table and I'm following, you know, kind of from the shadows here where, you know, where his his rehab is going and all that. And Engen, you know, to kind of bounce off of what Marco said, I would love to see what you're doing to rehab yourself and get back in the game and come back from, you know, what some of us would consider a serious injury.
SPEAKER_00: you know, injury, you know, to, to come back and get back on the table and, and to see your dominance, because bro, you are one, one fierce competitor and we all, we all respect you and you're a legend and we'd love to see you back on the table. We really would. I don't know if I have the same spirits, you know, I don't know. I don't know. I think you do. I don't know if I can. I mean, I mean, sometimes, you know,
SPEAKER_04: over something, when I get aggressive, I think I still have it. You don't get a nickname like the enigma of rage without being able to turn it on when you want it. Yeah. But the thing is, if you really want to be at the level to push your limits that much, you really need to put your goal in a place that's so important for you.
SPEAKER_04: yes it's so important for you so at the moment i really do not know if i can do that because like my mind and heart is divided you know yeah yeah serving arm wrestling as an organizer and this like let me you know honest you know just like show me show me an elite uh combat physical combat sport
SPEAKER_04: Top level guy that can do all the things that I'm doing to organize East versus West. And in the same exact event, he's competing there, you understand? So, I mean, fair point. It's a, it's a fair point, but you have to, you know, maybe if it was a regular tournament or something, you know, you know, it's okay. But, but this one is a little bit different and this is,
SPEAKER_04: like this has so much stresses. If you have all those ready sponsors and everything, you know that everything is secured, you understand? But here, it's all up to how, if the event will be okay or not. See, I saw a video that Devon shares, and then he's talking about
SPEAKER_02: He's talking about this. And these events, one part of the video, Devin said some words that touched my soul. Listen. And these events, guys, we are so lucky. We have never had East versus West. Our wrestling has never been on this level. At a high level, at the top of the world, we've never had the top pros, the very best from East and West coming together consistently.
SPEAKER_04: all throughout the year so it's a very special time for a sport one that we should know might not necessarily last forever so he's talking about that he's saying that what what what we have today does not necessarily last forever you know and then some people wrote that is
SPEAKER_04: Devon quitting armwrestling or if East versus West is ending or something neither of them no because I see that people are talking it's neither of them what he meant in my opinion he said that um we need to appreciate what we have and push forward you know to what we started you know and then we need to use this opportunity this is what I understand because
SPEAKER_04: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, They will also knows it. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, I met Devon in 2002 Niagara falls event. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, It was an event. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, When. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, There was an event, the organizer couldn't pay all the.
SPEAKER_04: prize money. He gave only one third of it. And I came from somewhere else to Canada to compete. And I get a little bit upset. And they will say, okay, we don't know each other, but, you know, you look like a good guy. We can go to my home. We can train together. I met him that way, you know. In 2004, I saw him in a tournament in, I think, Washington or something that was Superstar Showdown where he really troubled you on.
SPEAKER_04: and and then i was like wow the guy is good you know and then we had the northeast message board um his name is kurt but i don't know how to pronounce his last name how much how much or i don't know he he owned it that uh thing there was a forum armresting forum that the heart of armresting was beating there on database imagine a forum that john berzing rumbet neil pickup
SPEAKER_04: Igor Mazurenko, Sharon Remes, Cobra Rose, Dave Patton, and Alan Fisher, Cleve Dean, rest in peace. And all those legends, you know, imagine a place that we are daily chatting. You understand? That was like that. But we were like a family. But arm wrestling wasn't like this. We were in our small world. Nobody knew about each other. Nobody really took us seriously. That's the fact.
SPEAKER_04: you know so when joe when devon said that our mercy has never been like this he is not bullshitting whatever he's saying he's saying all from the heart when john tells me that he's happy with what i am doing this is our messing is like our baby are like flower that we
SPEAKER_04: planted you know long time ago of course there were many people before us at least before me and then but you know that the flag rise race you know when you do olympics you know you hold the flag and you so we are we can only be one of them so now we came to a point that that like we were dreaming so that's what devon is talking about this is my dream when people says anything you do great this this
SPEAKER_04: i really appreciate what people think but that is not the point it's not like the point is not i did this i did it's not point the point is we need to bring arm wrestling to a level that it deserves at that point after the point i can also quit it's okay you know as long as i know that it's in the safe but as of now you may not sound humble but me
SPEAKER_04: organizing this level events i kind of feel that the arm resting is in safe hands at least in what i do couldn't agree more couldn't agree more so that that until i see that it is safe and this and then i can just go and rest and someone can continue but but i really have this opportunity i'm going to serve it as long as community sports and people like you guys support and this is how we will go so this is what i wanted to say that devon
SPEAKER_03: didn't mean that uh was quitting probably he was talking about those those piracy and other kind of things that is harming paper really he was i think what he meant is everything doesn't last forever you know some things might happen you might you might die something might happen to you tomorrow and that's it you never know let's hope that doesn't happen let's just let's just say that right now let's hope that doesn't happen it will continue it's all lining up now
SPEAKER_04: It will continue, but maybe not this passion. Because I was there before, long before East versus West. So what I'm just saying is that everything is in it. It's not all about the business. Okay, Paul, you and Sasha, before that, maybe let's start from there. How confident are you?
SPEAKER_01: I know you love to play underdog. Yeah, that's what I want to be. Whether I'm the underdog or not, there's only a few things that really affect my confidence. And a lot of those things are the intangibles like, you know, overall health or injuries or things like that. Those are the things that nag in the back of my brain. You know, if I'm having an elbow issue or this bicep tendon issue,
SPEAKER_04: um but as i said i mean the good lord has blessed me i'm i'm very healthy right now you know good so make sure make sure that on may 6 you are in same condition that's the plan so don't panic don't push too much
SPEAKER_01: and then just make sure that don't go there i've switched some things up i've switched some things up especially because you know i've had shoulder issues since football you know and i still like the total body strength but i've switched some focuses up as far as rep ranges to to try and ensure that you know but uh you know to me those are the things that that that have a negative effect on on on confidence because to me those are things that are outside of my control
SPEAKER_01: so as far as confidence level i'm controlling what i can control you know i've been blessed to have a couple um high level arm wrestlers um and even eastern arm wrestlers um give me some advice on some specific styles of training for this this match which i am putting in there are some betrayers in the eastern team
SPEAKER_01: You know, just like I'm saying, how do you train? Like, how do you guys train for, you know, this style of hook pulling? Like, what are some strategies? And I've gotten like, you know, it's like you said, my training for this match is much less about just going and pulling and pinning people and stuff. My week to week training has become not practice, but actual training like reps training.
SPEAKER_01: holds, durations, sometimes less intensity, but to total failure. It's interesting because I've pushed myself really hard in some training methodology that I haven't done before and left dead from practice and expected the next day to be really sore in the inner elbow, and I'm not. So you're doing a lot more isometrics then, huh?
SPEAKER_04: yes yeah i believe that i believe that when you don't have those pressures under your control and increase then at the table you are having that pressures not under your control and that's why you're getting injured you know you need to make events under your control and then you understand you need to make sure that like you are not only
SPEAKER_04: training at the table with those things and some unexpected things you know will be eliminated if you do that under your control with the weights and rubber bands and other things you know yeah yeah i'm trying i'm trying to work a bunch of different things in but i mean it's it's been fun some things up yeah
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah yeah don't don't believe in everything devon says no no but that that is good training trust me i do that with the tennis ball yeah
SPEAKER_04: yeah not that one but the bigger one tennis yeah i have got one of those too yeah not a new one new ones are so hard but i have a friend he's a uh tennis trainer and then he has the old balls that they don't use it anymore so i tell him he gives me in a bag you know a hundred of them from there you can find any any level you know that's awesome that's awesome yeah so i do this and i do this this sometimes i do with two fingers but never with four fingers
SPEAKER_03: Anyway, so let's go with our predictions quickly. And so, Marko, do you know every guy from the East vs West Seven or you are not familiar with some of them? Bacho Saginasvili is very new. I've never, don't really know about him. I've watched one video on him, Big Hands, 18. So I don't know much about him, but, you know, yeah, I know basically all of them, yes.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so let's start with that match since you said that. What do you expect from that match, Adam Wozniacki and Bartosz Saginashvili? I mean, for me, Adam, he's won my respect how he won that match last against Boadir, isn't it? What he said as well and how confident he was. I think, in my opinion, not knowing much about Adam because, like I said, there's no training of him, there's nothing.
SPEAKER_03: i only know the um the match he had that one time i i'm gonna say that adam's gonna win because i've never seen bacho you know i've never seen him but i'm gonna say 64e for adam and you ted how do you see adam is your guy
SPEAKER_00: well yeah i mean of course i'm rooting for adam um you know he's a hoss and all that but i i would say that that's fair assessment i would say 60 40 uh you know it's it's definitely a uh it's definitely gonna be a tough match it's not gonna be an easy walk um if i will tell you this if adam does the what i call the stare and dare with him i'm gonna be thoroughly impressed i mean you know where you're just sitting there just like yeah go ahead and move me
SPEAKER_04: Just go ahead, please move me. If he does that, I'm just going to be thoroughly, thoroughly impressed. You know, some people, some people think that this is just like being too prideful, you know, to hold. No, I disagree with that. You know, these are all unique characters, you know, in our sport. You know, these like, like beautiful, this beautiful, different cultures. We are careful about dealing with each other, but I don't see anything disrespectful.
SPEAKER_03: that they control, you know, like what Devon does is a little bit, you know, pushing limits. Yeah, I agree. And how do you guys see Prokopcik versus Douglas? Oh, man, Prokopcik is one of our young, lightweight favourite men. I want to go with Daniel, but Doug Elrich looks so good up against Ray. It's a very hard, it's another 60-40 for me.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's actually, for me, I think it's, I think it's, I think, I honestly think Prokofchik is the favorite there. I do think his defensive, his defensive holds are better than, you know, than our guys' offensive pushes. I don't know. I hate saying anything against the USA, but I honestly think that Prokofchik is the favorite there. I think his defensive holds are just too good. I really do.
SPEAKER_04: That's why I said 60-40 to him because he's on another level. Paul, do you realise the knowledge level of the fans? Yeah, I'm telling you.
SPEAKER_04: telling you it's just like new arm wrestlers coming in i gotta show me how to arm wrestle the way the way the way that they explain the reasons and everything you know and they are like wow you know they may be different than ours but still they have a logic behind you know what they are saying you know i'm not saying that uh your opinions about these two matches are different but in the later
SPEAKER_03: uh predictions you may be different but i i see that you guys are reasoning everything very well you know i'm impressed you know wow it's a good good thing for our nursing good days daniel's static strength looks unbelievable yeah yeah i mean his his whole and marco what he can do right here is just incredible and how he's just i just love him he's one like i said he's one of my favorites i can't wait to have his card when it comes i'm sure i can't wait
SPEAKER_01: well just to just to give you guys like some affirmation of what you're saying like i talk to doug every day you know and in preparation we're going back and forth and a lot of what you know which you guys are identifying is what he's identifying i think um the biggest factor in this match is doug's doug's level and it's the same thing it's doug versus doug in this feeling's really high i'm really interested to see the version he brings because what we saw against ray was not
SPEAKER_01: finish package no no no no no that's what that's what'll make this interesting if you take the guy that showed up against red and you you make odds for um for daniel it's it's lopsided but if you take the potential that doug could bring oh yeah our coaster to the 50 50 range yeah you know you know the biggest biggest uh uh i said like most important thing is you guys are teaming up there
SPEAKER_04: You guys, when I invited the guys from West, first time and second time, they were like independent republics, you know, they were just representing themselves. Now I see something different coming there. You know, everyone is, you know, what to do, what to do, what to do, how to help each other, go there and kick ass, you know, and that part,
SPEAKER_04: that I see that the team spirit, and I think it is really helping. And I think that from one side, it is disadvantage, like US is just one country, while they're facing guys from East from different countries. It looks like disadvantage. Yes, it is. But from other side, all these guys are really supporting each other, while the opponents are
SPEAKER_04: From separate countries, they don't even have any connection with each other, except probably Georgia. Yeah, Georgia. Small country and a lot of tough guys. And Latvia. And Latvia. Those Latvians are, yeah. No, no, I'm just saying that they don't, right now, they're not part of it. Right. With this event. So I'm just talking about this specific event. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's go. Without that engine, we're not going to be able to compete. In the back of my head, the goal still is to win one of these as a team. You're giving it point scores. It's like a wrestler trying to go out and score a pin for his team. We want to do it, but without that team camaraderie, we're always going to be underdogs. How do we have a chance if we don't have those intangibles?
SPEAKER_01: and and for me it's like it's natural it's just organic you know like to be there and and to what i look at like rob vision i've talked to rob so much he you know he battles some of these things through arm wrestling where he gets jaded and goes away a lot of that has to do with you know him even saying like i've gone to tournaments in the united states and i feel like 90 of the rooms just waiting for me to lose so they can cheer i was like
SPEAKER_01: imagine if you get a rob you know who's trained for eight to ten weeks and also has this support system of people who genuinely want to help him and want him to win what what does that guy look like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and also this is only a beginning hopefully the fans will continue sporting and this dream will be
SPEAKER_04: many more years you know and then it will continue maybe we should do even the team trophies or something you know maybe we should do it yeah okay let's go to the next one because ted needs to go to work um revisions versus drop that
SPEAKER_00: what a match yeah unbelievable match uh i you know i i think that a lot of people are sleeping on rvj and i think that he is going to pull it out but again i don't think and i think that's hats off to you again and i don't think it's going to be a blowout one way or the other i think that rob's probably in my head the slight favorite i would give him 55 45.
SPEAKER_00: um i i really do but i but i again it's like i think a lot of people are sleeping on what this guy can do with the proper motivation um he's he's a killer he's a straight up killer and his hand is a weapon to be sure so i really do think that the fire is lit i really do think the fire is lit again and and he is he's coming for blood so i think it's going to be pretty good
SPEAKER_04: yeah before marco before you start uh guys i received countless emails to be part of this podcast from you guys i thank you very much for your uh attention and you're willing to be here and so just i will be uh back to you guys you know um
SPEAKER_04: slowly I just read the messages and I just try to match the fans you know with the possibly near like it's not possible to have one guy from a US and one guy from Malaysia because the time zone is just like like what's that probably 12 hours it can be even 15 hours if you consider from California so I'm just trying to calculate yeah uh everything and then
SPEAKER_04: I will try to do that constantly, constantly, but just don't think that I ignore you. There are so many messages. I try to consider all of them. So don't take this perspective. I cannot reply all of them. Don't think that you are ignored or something. Never. Okay, go ahead, Marco. I mean, I've watched Sasho beat RBJ before in a super match on Arm Wars. Do you know about that one? Yes, sir. Yep.
SPEAKER_03: I haven't watched him arm wrestle in a while, so I'm going to say 50-50 because I know how strong he is. Just from being back in the WAL and how big and jacked and like you said, his hand, mate. He's a savage, RBJ. I don't know why people don't like him. I don't get that. It's because of everything off the table. It's because of everything off the table.
SPEAKER_03: yeah all that stuff ain't the manly stuff so that ain't the stuff i like you know i like rvj when he was um when he arm wrestles off the table i don't see much about him so i know what you mean do you mean about the gear and the things people talking about let's just stay positive but it's just it's just the stuff on it yeah it's just yeah i'm gonna say 50 50 because zurab to me is so strong that i won't give anything above i won't take away from zurab at the same time i'm gonna go 50 50.
SPEAKER_04: yeah sean krauser thank you for your support just a little something for the tip jar great way to get the fans involved and get everyone hit the like button thank you sean thank you my friends yeah i love it i love it i love talking honestly i often go uh and then talk with them and then like i just like two hours i see but yes but this is now
SPEAKER_04: better that you know we can like throw them three of them one of them um okay let's go to another one adrian murado and cody cody merritt ted man i tell you um cody's really strong but i gotta give it to uh and how'd you pronounce his name correctly because i always butcher it
SPEAKER_00: I have to give it to him on a slight favorite. I'm probably going to say 55 or 60 to 40 on that one. Cody's big and strong, but I really do believe that Moratov will pull it out. I do.
SPEAKER_04: but hey i hope i'm shocked i hope i'm shocked because i want the west to win but i hope i'm shocked maybe the pound for pounds
SPEAKER_03: the strongest armwrestler on the earth you know maybe they're freaks mate him and on goodbye they're freaks they're freaks we love them mate well i'm goodbye of an alazan are freaks i think alazan is going to beat cody i don't think cody's going to win he's not good enough now he used to be i think but i think alazan's too jacked up he's too good i understand
SPEAKER_04: and i know you need to go to work so i'm hurrying up arif and this i don't know do you remember this i don't know text i i i don't to be honest with you i don't oh that's right yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay yeah yeah yeah i was like i also beat kalishenko three two and he beat wagner bortolato three two that wagner that wagner fight i honestly thought wagner was going to pass out on the stage
SPEAKER_00: Do you know Arif, right? Arif? Yes, yeah. Arif would be my default go-to. I do believe that he's... I just think he's a better puller. All around, I think he's a better puller. What's the most shocking world? What do you think it's about?
SPEAKER_03: I didn't hear that Marco, but yeah, I think. No, sorry, that wasn't me. My uncle just loves it and he was in the background there. Sorry, it's alright. Yeah, I think I think Mari or RF takes that one and I don't. I don't actually think that one's that close. I think RF takes it. I love it. I love to have the conversation with the fans. Go ahead, Marco. Yeah, see, I love it as well. Thank you brother for me. Arif, I love having thoughts from the Turk, but.
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to give it to Gorgi. From what I saw, Gorgi, I forgot his second name. I know him as Gorgi. I think he looks too strong on his last one. So I'm only going on his last appearance. But for me, Artem has had his time, in my opinion. But that's just me. I don't know. So you are saying that Desano is going to win? Yes. OK, I understand. Yeah. And let's go to another one. Brandon Alcacer versus David Samusha. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, tight, tight one. Brandon Brandon to me is on his way up and I think that he's got a lot of potential. Is he? Is he with? Oh, he's super strong, super, super strong. Is he? Is he there with David yet? I don't know. I'm cutting you for a short time. I just saw a picture or Brandon.
SPEAKER_00: and then he said that without the water loss he has nine pounds to lose he did not look any smaller than what i saw him last time if you would ask me i would just say that he got bigger you know yeah yeah he's he's his training's on point from what i hear he's motivated as hell um he's strong i don't you know i don't know if you've been training with him at all paul i haven't gotten a chance to meet him but i know he's i know he's he's on point
SPEAKER_00: and i really do believe that he's the favorite but not by much i again i'm gonna say 55 45 60 40 at the most but i think that uh i think that it depends on what version of david shows up as well because there's there's a couple of different versions that i've seen of david so far and if the aggressive just don't take a step back version shows up it could be a really long day for brandon yeah yeah yeah and before you uh start me marco
SPEAKER_04: I want to say something before. It's funny, something funny. Whenever I do this kind of podcast with the athletes, elite level athletes, I always have to remind what's the percentage of you giving to each side. But whenever I do this with the fans who have been already following without me asking, they are telling 55, 45, 60.
SPEAKER_03: they know they know already you know it's good yeah um for me for me david shomicha he's too good to me i don't think i want to see someone do better against him but at the moment i'm going to say favorite is david shomicha i'm going to stick with david the georgian so you are saying that yeah the thing is that it is not that easy to hook um i know that craig tuller has
SPEAKER_04: incredible hook inability not because only his wrist but he just like boom you know jumps you know and the heat so great you know and then whenever i saw craig couldn't hook brandon and then like i was like what if david cannot hook him and if david cannot hook him the match is gonna go to the endurance with an advantageous position for brandon and brandon is also known with his great
SPEAKER_01: uh endurance that we saw against uh greg so maybe paul lead would have an opinion about this one but how you see well i mean i trained with brandon i pulled pulled brandon in competitions over the years and one thing i can say about the guy is when you talk about like professionalism and like obsession he's totally 100 obsessed from the day he is like laser-like focused chasing people
SPEAKER_01: and chasing the next thing and he's willing to do anything so like when you say oh can he make the can he make the weight cut yes he can make the weight cut this guy will die trying to make the weight cut and oh by the way he's gonna walk in huge he's like rob he's he's all upper body he's got like the upper body of a 242 guy and like the legs of a 176 guy so when he cuts that weight he's still gonna look huge and he when he recovers he's gonna be it's all up here
SPEAKER_01: And like like Angus saying, he'll he'll die on the table trying to win. He can get a stop. It's going to be really, really good. So really, it's going to come down to that. I saw some pictures of the beat to where to be is looking thick and full. I saw a picture with him and Maddie and another guy. He's looking good. But I think those are the factors that are going to play into this one.
SPEAKER_01: we know brandon's gonna bring his best one this is a super bowl for him he's gonna leave it he's gonna he's gonna leave no rock gun turn so yeah is the beat gonna bring that same level or is he gonna underestimate i think david it's his home you know that that table is his home i think yeah it's a good one though i can't wait mate what a good match okay let's go to the legend tobias then
SPEAKER_00: Cool. LeLayton. I got to go with LeLayton, especially after the war that he had with David or Dave Chafee. I got to go with LeLayton on that one. I really... I don't know. I think that...
SPEAKER_00: I think he's got so many weapons and so many natural attributes with his height and his explosivity and the fact that we've seen now that he will go to the red line to the point where he had to be carried out to the hospital. I think that he's, yeah, I think that he's the favorite in that one. So I'm going to go 65-35. I think he's a favorite in that one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's very fair there, Ted, to hit that. I think I'm very similar. But Vitaly, for me, I'm a bit biased. He's one of my favourite arm wrestlers. He's got a lot of videos, like I explained before, showing his training, showing his personality. And Vitaly is just, he's an animal, mate. I think the Dave Chafee match could have gone either way. You know, he's easily as strong. So for me, in my opinion, I don't know what his left hand's like. And that's the only problem, because Tobias...
SPEAKER_03: Spurong, his left hand, he's a savage. So it's going to be a very good match, but I'm going with exactly what Ted said. I'm going to say 65-35 for Vitaly. Okay, let's go to Dave Chaffee and Rewaz.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah there's a coin flip if i've ever heard one uh i mean raw horsepower i gotta go with dave but ravaz is just i mean he's he's got just as much i mean it's like it's like putting two uh two tanks in the same freaking spot and just saying create a supernova in between your hands i mean it's it's incredible um
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. I think Dave's newfound versatility might play a part in it and put it in Dave's favor. But, man, I really couldn't go above 50-50 on either way. I really couldn't. And I love Dave Chafee. I do. But I don't think I could go above 50-50.
SPEAKER_03: Well said, mate. I'm very similar, but I'm a bit different. I mean, my uncle's here. We love Ravaz. For some reason, Ravaz, we love him. I mean, recently he just curled 150 kilos with Gennady. Yeah, I was just going to say that. I was just going to say that. Did you guys see that video? Yeah, yeah. I mean, Artem had a good match with him, and that's the only thing. Ravaz has had a bit of a back step, but...
SPEAKER_03: you know for me he's an animal so it's going to be such a good match but i'm going to give it to dave you know i'm going to go with chafe just because he's an og and he's just i don't know man he's just you know dave chafe bro he's there so yeah i'm gonna go 55 50 for chafee
SPEAKER_04: Can we comfortably say that this guy, Dave Sheffy, has the strongest side pressure in the world? I agree. Wholeheartedly. Wholeheartedly, I agree. The problem is if the match is going to stop after the touch is bad or somewhere here, because sometimes the last two inches of five centimeters...
SPEAKER_04: becoming problematic. And also sometimes the endurance is playing a game, you know, but now he has that the ability, if the mass starts, it quickly goes in shoulder pressure.
SPEAKER_04: And if that would be the case, can Rivas handle that? I don't think Rivas can handle a full-on shoulder press from Dave. I don't. But it's a matter... We will see. We still learn. That is a guess. It may be true. But we may see something that we learn. Rivas is going to flip on the first round and then we'll see who's stronger. Who would guess?
SPEAKER_04: what the way that hermes we learned something new right you learned something new right yeah yeah so so what i'm just saying that who would who would guess that the dave cheffy would cooperate with it we didn't know that we didn't see it before i mean at least i didn't i don't remember so what i'm just saying is we may learn something new and then let's go to the next one two more matches
SPEAKER_00: iraqi versus i think this is i think this is the best match on your card i i really do i think this is the best match on your card um i i it's it's you it's so hard to call because iraqli now has that flop wrist of his own that he the you know that he found uh ungarbaev is one of the most patient and mature young arm wrestlers out there uh and technically just unbelievable
SPEAKER_00: I just, well, younger.
SPEAKER_00: I'm 43, everybody's young. But I mean, you know, he's in his 30s, right? I mean, he's, yeah. Probably, probably like either 20, 29 or 30. Yeah, so I think he's one of the most technically sound and mature younger arm wrestlers out there, period. Like pound for pound out there, period.
SPEAKER_00: um and then you got a rock lee who has world-class back pressure and now if he does lose his wrist which is a possibility against dungarbaya that he does lose his wrist if he loses his wrist he he can go into a full-on flop press so i man i don't know like this one is the same thing man like 49 51 either way it's it's crazy such a good match such a good match
SPEAKER_03: i agree with you it's one of the best matches on the cards but i disagree that it's going to be close i think on goodbye it's just going to it's going to ruin it nothing really in my opinion i think iraqis a hand person where his hand's very strong on his bicep but for me on goodbye
SPEAKER_03: i don't know i want him to shock me iraq because i love iraq he's a young upcoming georgian i love him i've got no you know i love all the arm wrestlers like i said but on gabayev he's uh he's a different kettle of fish mate when you watch iraqli and john bazink for example it was a savage match but on goodbye made with john bazink look after a couple of rounds made him look weak so i don't know yeah but john was sick very strong
SPEAKER_00: John was sick for that match, though, where he'd just gotten over being sick. So there was a lot of, you know, there was a lot in the tank that went bad on that one. Because if you look at round one, John made Ongarbaev look like an amateur arm wrestler. Yeah, I agree, but I think Ongarbaev gave him a bit of, because Ongarbaev don't waste any energy, in my opinion. Right, right. Agreed. No, agreed. Agreed.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I agree with you. John Bozink was not 100%. So, yeah, I mean, that's a factor there. So, yeah, great match, but I'm going to give it to Angerbaev by 70%. Okay, Paul, I want to hear this one from you as well. I see Angerbaev as a favorite. Is it because all about the weather control? No, I'm just like, I'm looking at Iraqli as Iraqli having a lot of room to grow.
SPEAKER_01: yeah and i'm the buy of being already there you know yeah i i just think that so impressive not only with his physical ability but like with his mental like fortitude like against michael todd to me that was like that was like watching like you know ice dancing the way he arm wrestled it was incredible his comfortability in real positions
SPEAKER_01: his ability to maintain his wrist against michael's move when you are talking because we cannot hear you sorry man i want to stop there it's just my battery's running low but i thought there was a charger but there isn't it's fine keep going sorry
SPEAKER_01: yeah okay what's that yeah i i i think this has i think this has the making to be a really good match um and i'm you know i'm i'm like i'm gonna root for iraqli because i really like the georgians um but i see him as an underdog and i hope he takes that stance i know those guys in georgia are training like savages so i'm hoping he brings like another level but i i do see anger anger buy up as a distinct favor and and and and iraqli for iraqli this is dream
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah absolutely this is dream this is the opportunity and but i will tell you something about where whenever i watch hunger wave i just see a live arm wrestling lesson yes the way that he arm wrestle against michael todd i was like like i i can't think anything
SPEAKER_04: smarter than you know this you know just like beyond the limits you know like like everything incredible michael is so knowledgeable everything but he's um he counters you know everything that michael did he countered you know and he never pulled someone like and then from the first time he was already prepared and he already you you may be prepared but performance is different thing he performed also very well and let's go to the
SPEAKER_00: devin versus gennady that this is the last match and yeah i mean obviously i came out the gate telling you that devin was you know my guy um i you know he's he's my favorite arm wrestler but um i think that this is besides levon i think this is the the toughest match that he's had to face thus far um gennady's raw horsepower his energy his style everything is going to be a problem but devin's newfound
SPEAKER_00: mentality of simplifying everything to just the rise and fighting for the high ground and understanding that the high ground is not just a top role it could be in a hook it could be in a press as long as you control the high ground you control the match it doesn't matter where you are inside outside doesn't matter so you know if it
SPEAKER_00: man i tell you do i believe that he's only training his thumb no but i do like the mentality that you know he said he's done lifting weights it's going to be a lot of table time a lot of endurance and i think that's the right way for devin i i think we're going to see you know we're going to see that open top roll slash kings move round one absolutely i i think that's absolutely going to be the case um i think that he's going to try to climb over the top of uh gannati's hand but gannati
SPEAKER_00: has a textbook on how to beat a king's move we saw that against michael todd so i mean it's you know it's it's going to be a difficult match i still have devin being the favorite i think it's going to be 65 35 devin um but i really do believe that the opening couple of matches are going to really push devin to the limit
SPEAKER_00: um but devin is devin's the new generation besides levon okay before anybody gives me hate in the chat besides levon devin is the king of arm wrestling in this generation i i really do believe that as far as technical ability mindset warrior mentality all of it i really do believe that devin is the complete package
SPEAKER_03: well well said mate everything there well said i'm going to go with um because like you say i can't really go against devon so i'm going to go 55 devon 45 gennady but i have to rate gennady because i've always loved him mate he brings the energy he brings the strength it's a very good match engine very good match uh i hope that what happens
SPEAKER_03: similar to the prutnik i think giannardi might have the good first round i know they didn't give him the pin when he went with devon but i think he'll have a first round but then i think devon's gonna beat him i think it's gonna be three one devon okay and paul you shared during your own yeah i love it i love it how do you see i so when i'm when i'm basing like i'm basing a lot of my opinion on this um
SPEAKER_01: off of Devin's respect for Gennady the things that Devin's saying like you know he like when it comes down to the come down he's he's saying like this is going to be the hardest match this could be the hardest match in my life so Devin is seeing something um that maybe we're missing I I think I think Devin brings a a favorite as far as endurance but Gennady's also way up there
SPEAKER_01: And I think what makes this interesting is the advantages that Devin was able to gain psychologically against Prudnik. I think had a big, had a big, absolutely. Yep. I don't think that he's going to be able to gain those footholds against Gennady. No, I just think number one, there's a language barrier. And number two, I don't think if there wasn't a language barrier, I don't think he'd buy into it. Gennady has too strong of a mind for that. I got to meet those guys, the Georgians, you know, a couple of times and hang out with them.
SPEAKER_01: I really like him, and I really think Gennady's just, he's a warrior. He's a warrior. Strong in the head. I think if Devin gets a stop in any of the first three rounds, he probably wins the match. But there is a strong possibility that we see possibly the best Devin Larratt match yet. Yeah. It's amazing.
SPEAKER_04: My favorite, but we're talking about a 49-51. I think it's really going to be good. When you guys said that 35, 45, 49 for Gennady, is it representing the difficulty of the match, or is it representing that there is a possibility that Gennady actually can win that?
SPEAKER_00: i i think that there's a possibility that that he can i think that he's got enough raw horsepower and i think that he's got enough drive and mental fortitude to to to be able to dismantle devin but i mean look i again complete bias i'm a devin fanboy okay um to dismantle devin is is probably the hardest thing to do in arm wrestling today
SPEAKER_00: To dismantle all of his weapons is probably the hardest. And all of his tricks, let's be honest. All of his tricks and all of his weapons and all of his prowess and all of that. Not to mention the dude's pretty strong. To dismantle that complete package is probably one of, if not the toughest thing to do in arm wrestling today. And the only person to do it completely to date is LeVon.
SPEAKER_00: the only person to do it completely now has there been chinks sure you know chinks in devon's armor absolutely but to do it completely to completely dismantle devon there's only one person on the planet to do it so far and that was lavar yeah yeah and you really need to i mean you said that devon respects gennady so much that's true but did you see paul what devon said to gennady i said i said
SPEAKER_04: david do you think do you really think that gennady will give up he said even if he doesn't give up he will be so helpless that he will be like a cow that all four legs cut it and just move it like this you know there's no connection you know you can't do anything you know so after gennady heard about this gennady said that he made this very personal like and then he said that you know
SPEAKER_04: that one is in trouble in short you know yeah yeah so and then let's go to the last one and you guys see i i understand as well as i understand paul underdog but pauline versus sasha
SPEAKER_00: Hey, Paul in 60-40. Now, look, he knows it's going to be a tough fight. He knows that. Sasho is a great match for Paul, you know, stylistically as well as a test. Paul, you're the champion, brother. You've got the target on your back, and you're going to be bringing all of the best to your doorstep. I've got nothing but faith in you, brother, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I really do believe that you've got it. I believe that you've got a lot of growing to do as far as, you know, in your journey. And I think that we've only seen kind of the tip of what what Paul Lynn's going to bring. And for that, I'm excited as hell.
SPEAKER_00: I really am. I think you've done a lot of maturing. Don't get me wrong. That wasn't a dig. I think that you just have a long trajectory, you know, and a nice good trajectory left to go. So I'm very excited to see where you do go, man. And I'm, I'm a, I'm a really big fan of yours. I really am. So. Thank you, Ted. I appreciate it, man.
SPEAKER_04: if you want me to go ahead and switch that prediction to 90 10 underdog that's what all right 90 10 underdog paul's gonna get crushed okay i'm i'm i'm i'm an organizer i was gonna say something like uh heavily statue you know but you know just just to motivate him yeah but yeah go ahead marco
SPEAKER_03: Thank you, Engine. I'm sorry. No, I'm not actually, because you don't mind, do you, Paul? But I'm going to go 50-50, because like I said, I've only seen very good things about Sasho, Paul, and
SPEAKER_03: I don't. I need you to win for me, bro, but I'm going to go 50-50, but I really want you to win, man. You're the better ref to me. You're the package, man. You're the champ. Come on, man. I agree with everything he said, man. Except from where he said you've got a lot of room, the journey goes up. I think you're at the top there. The only thing you've got to do is keep getting stronger, bro, and that's what you're doing. Honestly, Paul, man, kill it for me, bro. 50-50. I'm going to do my best. There's some data out there, Marco.
SPEAKER_04: there's some interesting moments you know this guy this guy i know him i know paul i i talked a lot with him i also have been witnessed in what he does this guy is mentally very very strong this guy is very strong mentally he was losing against samusha he won the first round against samusha then lost two rounds and i thought that you know he would be down or something you know and
SPEAKER_04: Personally, I thought he was over, you know. He just went there and beat him two more rounds and then won 3-2. So if he is bleeding, there is a hope. You know, this guy will never give up. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. But listen, I got to get you. Finish it, yeah. Okay. The period says that Devon, that beat Prudnik facing Gennady now. Do you guys think he's better than Devon that beat Andrei Pushkar and John Brzezinski?
SPEAKER_00: uh in the past yeah devon beat pushkar with left arm and i don't know that that's i don't know what this is okay it's so hard to say because devin devin has gotten so much more as he would say devious and so much more knowledge in the last you know 15 years so i mean i would say that you would have to say that yes he's better and his high hook has returned to him so there you go i mean he's got the stability back in his elbow now so he can pull inside now he couldn't do that for over a decade
SPEAKER_04: well said we will see we will see anyways guys ted thank you very much i know you need to go to work thank you thank you very much marco it was an honor and pauline thank you very very much my friend for being with our fans you know that these are the guys that are making everything possible and we appreciate what they are doing yeah thank you guys thank you
SPEAKER_04: How about the older double bicep? Yeah. Yeah, the little puny ones. Come on, Marco. Come on. Yes, Marco. Have a good one, guys. Thank you so much. Thank you. Take care, Marco. Take care. Thank you.
