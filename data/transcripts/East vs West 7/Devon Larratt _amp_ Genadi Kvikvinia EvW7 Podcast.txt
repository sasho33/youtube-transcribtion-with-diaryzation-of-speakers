SPEAKER_01: Hello, guys. Sorry about it. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
SPEAKER_03: There was a time change in North America last night. So I thought that it was right now, soon to be 12 p.m., but it is already past 12 p.m. So it happened last night. So over here, we didn't know about this one. We didn't know. And Devon just warned me. And you realize that it is already, you know, like after 12. And then I was like, oh, did time change? He said, yes.
SPEAKER_03: last night so i think again he will join us but he will be a little bit late devon doesn't have so much time he has appointment at 2 p.m so and so let's see hello devon how are you my friends hey buddy what's going on yeah yeah it's it's like like very uh interesting that you know it just happened
SPEAKER_04: last night and i didn't know this yeah i i don't know why we still do this we should just everybody should just get rid of the time change and we just have one time over here we were doing the same thing and we said no more the standard timing all the time the same yes of course that's the way it should be this this switching time all i got on it it's completely crazy yeah so how have you been
SPEAKER_03: good yeah really good yeah excited what are we now are we seven or eight weeks out it's getting close yeah a little bit more than eight weeks i think or or just exactly eight weeks one day less than eight weeks yeah right very close yeah yeah weeks yeah yeah i i sent message to gennady he didn't have double tick you know on whatsapp and now okay he doesn't answer so so maybe he's maybe he's nervous
SPEAKER_03: yeah that's why probably he doesn't want to face you already probably nervous yeah yeah it's understandable it's understandable yeah yeah so nice new haircut you got there yeah yeah getting getting getting old and yeah i start training i feel i feel better when i when i when i shave my head and yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, more professional. Yeah. More serious. Oh, geez. Look at you. Yeah. Who knows? Maybe soon. Oh, hang on. I'm way too big. No, I'm not talking about it. Just let me finish. We may be in the same event, I was going to say. Oh, really? Who are you going to pull? Who knows? Who knows? Would you like to see me competing? Yeah, for sure. Yeah, that'd be great. Who would you pull?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. Let me train now. Some things are getting real up, like pronator is 85, 90%. Mostly the arm strength, bicep, brachioradialis is a little bit behind. I don't know if it has anything to do with this one or I didn't train enough. Maybe I do. Whenever I do table time, pronator is always training and bicep is not really. So I think this one needs a little bit more time, but
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I can be ready in hopefully three months. Nice. So left hand, right hand, both? Left hand arm is behind right because since 2019, I didn't compete and I didn't really train. I see some like almost permanent, you know, dangles. But maybe it's not. Maybe it will come back. But right is stronger. But, you know, you know, the bicep.
SPEAKER_03: so let's see one more time a lot of people are writing already let me see there is a super chat i love aoc devon is his hair better than yours so i mean even though my hair is really bad my hair would probably be better than is because i actually have hair
SPEAKER_03: i haven't done anything since you tricked me and i haven't done anything so it's yeah yeah yeah it was good it was good getting wild again you almost almost deceived me by giving you that type of how do you call that clown that's it yeah crusty crusty the clown across the clown yeah that one i almost believed you i was like wow he has
SPEAKER_03: faceless wife, you know, that would like him that way, as he claims, you know. And, yeah. Kirsten says... I might have to do that haircut still. I might have to do that. Maybe, maybe soon. You do it yourself. I will not believe you for sure, yeah. Kirsten Prodigy, my friend, good to see you. Keep it up, buddy, he says, yeah. And they are asking you, how confident are you against Gennady?
SPEAKER_04: Well, I mean, where I am now is not where I will be on the day. I think that it's a very close fight. That's my assessment. I think it's very close. I think he has areas that he's stronger than me, and I have areas that I'm stronger than him. I think that it's a very good fight. Very, very good, but
SPEAKER_04: I do think that I'm going to win, but I... It'll be a couple than your previous two fights. My previous two?
SPEAKER_04: mean i i believe that this will be probably one of the hardest fights of my entire career if not the hardest because even though levon was harder dennis was harder they were so far out of reach that it wasn't really a fight whereas this match i feel like yeah yes very close so
SPEAKER_04: i don't i i expect this to be probably the hardest fight of my life potentially because yeah like of arms a lot of strong guys but um ghanadi is strong and he's versatile and he's resilient so i don't expect if i can beat him one way he has the ability to come a few different ways so and also he has good endurance he has good endurance yeah yeah
SPEAKER_04: it's i think it's gonna be a very good fight uh i think i'm gonna win uh i i think but but i do not expect it to be easy at all i i will be so shocked if i destroy him i'll be so shocked but that's now i mean you asked me ask me the day before the event and i'm gonna kill him i'll wipe the floor with them you know but
SPEAKER_03: it's still early i i can't i can't say those things yeah do you think do you think that you are also like thinking of gennady that you know do you think there is a possibility a different gennady to show up like for me for me i mean you are like not only for me some people says it's schoolboy or something but we are talking about the different type of fame you understand
SPEAKER_03: I'm talking about really elite way of arm wrestling. You are by far the most famous arm wrestler. And whenever people are going to arm wrestle you, they see this as the biggest opportunity in their career. And in my opinion, you are the biggest match of Gerrard. Even though he pulled Levan and he pulled this guy, that guy, this is the most important match.
SPEAKER_03: so as you see and i see that this guy is growing and it's only like still we have two months you know that that is not the gennady is kind of a little bit big you know so i kind of see different preparation so what i just say that i am sure two months later you will be much better than how you are right now but do you expect him to be also different yeah i mean look at he's he'll be the best he can be i'm sure
SPEAKER_04: um but you have to be careful with pressure that you put on yourself um you know anybody who's been a at this level at this level of competition i mean people always get excited about their next match people always get and sometimes if you get too excited you can break yourself and you can hurt yourself so gennady needs to be careful that he doesn't get so excited that
SPEAKER_04: you know, he actually in his attempt to be the best he's ever been actually falls short because he trains too hard or he, he hurts himself in some way. So I think that,
SPEAKER_04: i i don't think it'll be some radically different form i think he will do his absolute best and he'll be his absolute most focused and probably his best but i'm not expecting some new love some new thing that we've never seen i think you'll be a little bit better some crazy deviation better yeah yeah yeah but me i
SPEAKER_04: Oh, wait. Are you still there, Engin? You still there? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm frozen or you're frozen? Oh, it's a bit frozen. You still there? I am. I am frozen. Oh, no. I was frozen, I think. Yeah, but I'm going to show up, like, probably 25% better. Probably about 25%. Yeah. You will be 25% better than them? Probably 25% better than when I faced LeVon. You're joking, man.
SPEAKER_03: yeah i'm joking oh yeah okay okay because then that 25 percent i mean no no no i'll be good you know yeah yeah i think i'll be better than this yeah yeah yeah i've been very consistent very very consistent my training is very good i uh i was a little bit worried
SPEAKER_03: Because I too, see, what I just accused Gennady of potentially, I did that a little bit. So I got a little bit too excited right away. That's not me. Devon, you know that you can get better to a certain level. It will not be more than that, no matter how much you push. And most likely pushing too much.
SPEAKER_03: will do more harm than yeah give you anything extra so i think i think you need to be confident i think you need to be confident too yeah you just be yourself you should believe that even now you can beat him and whatever whatever well i do think i'm starting already because there is a time change with the north america try to reach gennady because the my message just doesn't
SPEAKER_03: okay okay okay yeah yes is that canadi no it was roman the translator guy and there is there is a there is a good question for you stop the b oh that guy yeah i know who that is i know who it is now yeah he said devon when will you stop avoiding wikileaks can't do the webbing hit against him hey
SPEAKER_04: listen man i don't know what i don't know what denied it to me when i confronted you i had i.t guys find out who you are i don't know why you don't just call me up on the phone buddy like we used to so funny when you find out who your haters are it's so funny to me like right now nobody
SPEAKER_03: has any right to criticize you they were criticizing you right or wrong it doesn't matter that you are not facing the north of uh eastern europeans then you pull who wouldn't get same weight yeah and then you pull sundries who is the current world champion and and i saw no disrespect to sundries i respect him so much
SPEAKER_03: but that you made him look you know like a beginner sorry but you would do that to anyone almost at that weight i i would like to see you with ongar where i see you as a favorite guy but the guy his table iq is also very high and i think his endurance is also very good i'm not saying that he can beat you but i think that he would be more competitive than this previous to my opinion
SPEAKER_03: I think so too. Now, now you're pulling Gennady and you are planning to pull Dennis and then Hermes and this. So people just need to be patient and wait because right now you don't deserve any kind of criticism. My honest opinion, my friend. Yeah. Yeah. I'll keep, I'll keep fighting. That's for sure. Oh, SG record. Roman, Roman showing up. There he is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: danny hello guys hello hello my friend danny maderos is asking devon how does gennady's thumb match up to yours i don't know what that means exactly but oh well they know that i'm doing my thumb training yeah but they are saying how does he match his cousin like how is his thumb gonna compare to mine yeah yeah see my thumb is just growing all the time
SPEAKER_03: i saw the picture that's real right that's real that's real yeah my thumb is surpassing john brzenk levels that is a tough question for you yeah uh then olex love child thank you for your super engine can you ask devon to honestly answer why he asked for six rounds thank you oh yeah well no i mean hey i put it out there i said
SPEAKER_04: look at to me i've and look i don't need to change anything i don't if it's a three out of five i'm totally happy no problem we do three out of five no problem i'm happy i just think that there's a chance because i know gannati and i just i'm thinking about it for him he may want more he's a good guy such and such a nice guy you see the right roman
SPEAKER_03: extra chance he also told me devin also told me that he wants to start like this just to give to make sure that he feels satisfied so if he wants four like
SPEAKER_04: First to four wins, I would do it because that's the kind of sportsman that I am. I'm the kind of sporting guy that will give him that opportunity to either win bigger or lose bigger. It's his choice. And I fully understand if he's not comfortable. Like if it's concerning to him and he thinks he's got to get it done fast, then that's okay.
SPEAKER_03: You're just setting up the traps, man. We know you are setting up the traps. I have a question for you, Devon. I want quick, short answers, if possible. First of all, do you believe that your endurance is better than Gennady's? You know, I do not... Another question, does it depend on where the match stops? I do not believe that I have ever really...
SPEAKER_04: it's not true i have been well actually i don't really feel that i've ever quit before my opponent i don't think it ever really happened i've been beaten but i never really i don't think that endurance i get beat in that component i i have not i have not yet really experienced it yeah so you are saying that nobody just waited and exhausted you is what you are saying yes
SPEAKER_04: no not yet i'm sure it'll happen at some point maybe gannadi will and that's why i offered it to him that's why i said if you want if you feel like you're that guy and i think that he might he might think that but maybe he doesn't maybe he thinks he's just got to get it done three out of five and that's but no i mean i i think that if somebody wants to sit with me i mean i normally win normally
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, in a equal position is different, but if somehow you you caught that way and if someone is like this, do you think that there is a possibility that you may get exhausted? Oh yeah, of course, of course is a possibility and I encourage people. I encourage people to try and I think that it would be a great great win if somebody could do that to me. I think that that would be a brilliant victory and I think that all athletes.
SPEAKER_04: to face try to exhaust you right they all should try to exhaust you right yeah look it people have this mindset that they need to beat me quickly and this is why they're failing if they were to just stay with me and slowly defeat me they'd see that they had a much better chance yeah yeah yeah you know you know your nose is growing so much reach to istanbul you know
SPEAKER_03: I'm using it all the time. It's my new favorite filter. Yeah. Yeah, you are. There is another question. They wouldn't did the hoster is asking that when did you get stem cells injected into your thumb? I did. Yeah, I love that guy. By the way, hoster everybody follow his channel is this guy's great. But yes, I did. So
SPEAKER_04: um i got stem cells in my thumb the last time i went so not this time i just went and this time i went i got it right in the thumb joint yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because i told him i said i said for karate this time i'm only training my thumb so i need extra all around here so they gave it to me right in my thumb joints so you are only training this one right nothing else
SPEAKER_03: nothing else yeah whenever you say this kind of things can you turn to your right side or your left side so your nose wouldn't be coming to my eye or something you know just you watch you watch my thumb dominance when he tries to do anything against my thumb everything will break my thumb will break everything
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah yeah but it's important for sure for for pronation especially the way that you are using it you are sometimes over pronating you are not like so much coordination of this and this at the same time unless the opponent comes to you you know you like to do it because you know that in in in that game you are far ahead of rest of the people in that game you know if they wanted to play that game i also
SPEAKER_03: So that round one, you and Lewan pulled. When Lewan tried to top roll you, both of you, the wrists were like natural. But whenever Lewan did the same thing to Hermes, he actually took Hermes' wrist. So maybe not the copying power,
SPEAKER_04: just curry but the handling you know the pressure handling the wrist handling yours might be ahead of uh hard to say hard to say you know my point you understand my point i this is a move that i'm very familiar with now like basically since i got surgery on my right hand which is 2013 i think
SPEAKER_04: i've been doing this outside top roll king's move style all the time so i mean that's that's a straight 10 years of working a certain style as my base so i mean i i rms a lot of different ways but this outside top roll this option where i i pronate it's it's gotten quite proficient so oh there he is now there's yeah there's dimly yeah i don't know if you can hear us yeah
SPEAKER_03: some people are asking why this is gonna start in different time guys i didn't know that there was a time change in north america last night there was a time change so there was eight hours difference from here to there eastern time eastern standard time now it's seven hours so there was a confusion and devon warned me so that is how this happened
SPEAKER_03: Rafa is asking, will you face Hermes after you beat Gennady and Dennis? After Gennady and Dennis? Well, there's definitely a flow to things. There's actually, I'll never arm wrestle Hermes. Never arm wrestle Hermes. Yeah, you say this just to save time, you know, so that people can stop talking. They wouldn't put pressure on you. This is how I see it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Roman can you can you ask him Devon said that Gennady is gonna submit during the match you know he's just gonna stop pulling after a point and he he what does he think about this
SPEAKER_04: Well, I really want to know is when he's going to submit, not what he thinks about it. I just want to know, is it going to be round 1, 2, 3? Oh, OK. He's going to submit, I'm sure, but which round he's going to submit. OK.
SPEAKER_03: So Gennady's response is like this. Throughout the entire his arm wrestling career, he has never been tired or exhausted by the opponent. And this is vice versa that he aims to tire you down.
SPEAKER_03: So be ready for that. So what did he think? Did he understand the video that I posted with the question of if he wanted to go four? Okay, I will ask you. I'm not going to change the rules for one match. People think that it will look very unserious for my organization. Sorry about that one.
SPEAKER_03: if i if i ever change it i'm gonna change it by announcing that from now on all the super matches or at least the title matches or something but not specifically one match oh no no i mean you guys if you guys want to pull pull five rounds you know we can talk about that one
SPEAKER_03: Devon, you really need that? You really need that? No, no, no, it's not for me, Engin. It's not for me. Okay, okay, then you wouldn't get upset then. It's okay. No, no, no, no. It's for Gennady. Gennady said he tires everybody out and everything, so I thought maybe it would be better for him. Gennady, I'm just going to say this. I don't know if you understand what I'm saying. I don't know if you understand what I'm saying.
SPEAKER_03: he's gonna beat you five no no problem five zero oh no another question devon said that he has so many trophies but you cannot see them because it takes people's soul
SPEAKER_03: know he just controls them and talk with them and then they give up and then by doing this he takes their soul like you you remember the the the freddy krueger you know he was keeping people here they were trying to get out see devon doesn't show us but whenever he takes the t-shirt there are many of them is trying to get out though and can you ask gennady and he says that uh devon says that gennady's soul
SPEAKER_03: will be one of the best amongst the ones that you know,
SPEAKER_03: Devon took. What does he think about this one? OK.
SPEAKER_03: His soul is so messy that physically he cannot fit inside you there. His soul is so messy, even if you take it. You're not enough for that. I'll take it piece by piece, piece by piece.
SPEAKER_03: he's gonna give you some from the beginning just to make you feel better and then he'll take it back yeah that's when they go to give photos before we already go he can give some peace are you thinking about shaving your beard for the match canadi i worry that i might snatch it and start to pull
SPEAKER_03: He reminds you, Devon, that his beard can withstand up to 50 kg. 50? 50 kg. Yeah. Can you handle that? Yeah, you can grab it.
SPEAKER_03: at that point no problem i just be careful because i'm going to try and snatch it i'm going to you know this guy devon once he feels comfortable and he just starts talking
SPEAKER_03: once i can get out he just talked with you and then the other day when i had the podcast with hermes i said what is the the biggest nightmare in arm wrestling and i said do you agree that you know just imagine you pull him with devon and he stops here and he's like no no yeah yeah he said it's like nightmare you know it's terrible you know and he said like he wouldn't want to you know
SPEAKER_03: like experience that you know just imagine that you know like i'm not like criticizing anyone but that brutnik thunder is this guy just falls and just waits and talks with them and they just like i mean you understand it just it really gives you some psychological damage that you probably wouldn't forget till you die you know so does does gennady has like have such concern you know what if he stops him and starts talking with him and like
SPEAKER_03: Does he have that kind of fear?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, Gennady responded that he would not understand English, so it's not a problem for him. He doesn't know. He's English. As long as Gennady, as long as Devon looks not going to start talking Georgian to him, there's no problem because. Oh, listen, listen.
SPEAKER_03: listen listen roman this was not the answer i was expecting i thought that he was gonna say that that will never happen that is out of option out of possibility but now it sounds like you know he's like you know okay as long as it doesn't speak georgian i'm okay with it i kind of feel like you understand my point you know what i think again i think he he actually wants to stop with the devil entire day or not maybe that's his plan
SPEAKER_03: I don't know, but this answer... Okay, Sean is asking. Hello, my friend Sean. Devon, you should go deep in a hook with Gennady and then do a Ken Opana. Yes, that's a good idea. That's a great idea. And that would be a terrible, terrible thing to do, to use his own words against him.
SPEAKER_04: And I'm not that kind of person. I would never do something to really hurt Gennady. I would never do that. But instead of opener, can opener, you're going to say can opener. Oh, right. Can opener. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Almost the same thing. I would never do that. Never.
SPEAKER_03: no it's now going to be my word
SPEAKER_02: Okay, ask him, ask him what is his chance, you know, winning, honestly, objectively. Do you think that your chances, Mogheb's chances, are 10% and 10%? Or is it the other way around? No, no matter what form it is, I don't want to be in such a situation. I don't want to be in such a situation. I don't want to be in such a situation. I don't want to be in such a situation. I don't want to be in such a situation.
SPEAKER_02: There is a lot of psychological pressure on these people, there is a lot of pressure on them to speak up. And I think that this will cause a lot of problems for these people. In any case, if you want to know the truth, you will know the truth about 30 percent. I think that there is no chance. There is no chance.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Gennady restrained himself to say exactly percentage-wise, but he gave a good explanation. So he, first of all, he thanked you, Engin, and thanked Devo for taking this challenge because it is his, it's been throughout the years and maybe even decades, it was his dream match to happen. And right now, as we're speaking right here, right now, he feels psychologically ready. He feels that best place he has ever been, not only physical shape,
SPEAKER_03: but also mentally because this is his dream match and he's been preparing for this like very, very at like 110%, you know. So he has practically never been in better shape. So he's going to come at you, Devon, like he has never done before. So you have to be ready for it. Yeah, he will deliver. I told you, Devon. I told you, Devon. I told you. And he also said that he's 30% better than he has been previously.
SPEAKER_04: 30%. Come on, nobody gets 30% at this age. Nobody's 30% better. Maybe 3% better. 3%.
SPEAKER_02: He will prove that it's actually that big of a deal.
SPEAKER_02: In fact, I am not the only one who has these problems, and I would like to say that I am a member of this community. I know that Deoni is a legendary philosopher, and I think that his work, or the work of the Georgians, is of great importance. And I think that it is important for me to say that I am a great fan of all people, and I am proud of this work.
SPEAKER_02: That is to say, if I give the maximum amount of money, I will be able to buy wine, I will be able to sell wine. It is important what you have, but if you spend 10% of what you have and sell it, you will be able to make a profit. But if you spend this much, you will not be able to make a profit in the future. This is one of the main problems of the state.
SPEAKER_03: so devon uh like he said already this match is his dream match he's been preparing this for like his best he could do and usually whenever he prepares or any athlete prepares against anyone in the armwrestling sometimes some things may come alongside doing this preparation that can prevent you to actually do what you wanted to do and in this case uh such problems like uh
SPEAKER_03: the problems that is not dependent on him so personally but uh environment is now gone because everybody around him his friends his family members everybody knows how important this match against you is for canadi so everybody was like
SPEAKER_03: I will take care of this. You just train for them. You take care of this. You train for them. So he said that everybody is helping him to prepare at best. This is how serious he takes you. And that's why he's saying that this would be a really tough match for you. And then lastly, he also said, even if he loses, he will be as long as he is putting his 100% in the match and he manages to do that. Even if he loses, he's very, very happy for that.
SPEAKER_03: as long as he puts 100 and he is coming there to put 100 there yeah so this is kind of like a national national i don't know pride that everybody is supporting you know the the georgia wants to keep the the the record you know
SPEAKER_03: Gennady also said that Georgians know who is Devon Larratt enormously, and beating Devon Larratt, everybody knows how much that would mean. So everybody is now like, not only Gennady, but the entire Georgia is against him right now. Everybody's helping Gennady to prepare for it now. Well, how is it going in Georgia? If I were to go to Lebanon, I would say, Devon, Devon, you can't beat me.
SPEAKER_02: very interesting thing he said right now he said that as long as they were not competing against georgians everybody in georgia is voting for the devil because that's how much love is accumulated throughout the years towards you down
SPEAKER_03: but obviously when you are pulling georgia just like it was against lebanon everybody is rooting for georgian guy so this is very very significant match in uh the uh okay william torres uh super chat thank you for your super devon huge fan if aramis loses to jerry would you aim to for jerry for the number two spots
SPEAKER_04: Well, I'll tell you, in no way do I think that even if Jerry wins, that he's the number two guy. There's no way that that's true. Come on, if he beats Hermes. It's a trick. It's just a trick. Listen, if Gennady and Jerry pulled again, I'd bet all my money on Gennady. Whenever that happens, it changes. But so far, this is what we have.
SPEAKER_03: Gennady, do you think Devon will be stronger and have more endurance than Sheffy?
SPEAKER_02: We didn't ask about Jerry, we didn't ask about Dave.
SPEAKER_03: No, I, uh, yeah, he, he started saying about the Dave that he's, uh, he's stronger than Dave and he's also, um, more enduring than Dave because, uh, he has never been tired even against Jerry cut, but he just got injured and couldn't finish the match. And that's why he mentioned Jerry. Yeah. And he just repeated himself. Dave's endurance is really not that high.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but even the strength, he thinks that one is...
SPEAKER_03: yeah two times they've managed to top roll him and then third round he stopped and everybody ready go first round
SPEAKER_03: the power of dave that he felt and power of devon in a fresh match and we are not talking about endurance what does he think who uses power is higher he thinks it means that directly he's gonna beat him two rounds as dave did and he has better endurance so he's gonna lose three zero
SPEAKER_03: When Dave dominated him two times, does this mean that Devon is going to do the same thing since he's stronger? And since Devon has better endurance, so he's going to be 3-0? How does he think? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It was his fault against Dave Chaffee. He could not utilize his complete hand control because of his broken finger and he was lost in his mind what to do. But now these problems are all gone.
SPEAKER_03: he doesn't he thinks that he could have taken uh those first two rounds as well if there was no broken finger broken finger when he pulled dave yeah middle finger here yes this middle finger was broken oh wow i didn't know yeah okay
SPEAKER_03: Oh, nice. Nice. No, it's not even opening, so no problem right now. Okay. Corey Warren is asking, one by one, the Europeans shall fall. Devon is the god. Thank you for your superchats. And another question, and then we talk bronze.
SPEAKER_03: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, People, thanks for your support that there was there's nobody gets 30% better at this age and it proves is what that. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, stands wrong when they claim you can get hundred percent better within six months to be people. Mark Broughton, 30% a lot.
SPEAKER_03: 30% is a big jump in a short amount of time. I think 30% it can be like all your life you eat bread and cheese and bread and cheese and bread and cheese. And then you didn't know how to train and you were not technically good. And then suddenly you know how to train and you eat more than cheese and bread and this and this. That way maybe, yeah. Yeah, 30%. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Who is more technical, Gennady or Devon? I don't know to whom this question is directed, but both these guys are known. I mean, they are to me very similar. They are not like really flat pinner and they are endurance-based guys and they can pull in any possible direction. To me, very similar. But from outside, when we look at it,
SPEAKER_03: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Ph.D.: Devon's endurance. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Ph.D.: seems better and since then, I did not he can you ask him again, he is not a like a flash you know you know he's not like a destroyer you're not like push cut, but he likes to war and fight so he thinks that his endurance is better than Devon.
SPEAKER_03: Gena, you mentioned that, as Mr. Pushkar said, the flashbangs were fired, and it wasn't Magi's fault, it was his fault that he was shot and killed. I think it was Devon's fault, it was Devon's fault, wasn't it? Well, it's not Magi's fault, but as I said, I don't have a problem with the shooting. I don't have a problem with the shooting.
SPEAKER_03: So right now he cannot tell anything specific because they have never pulled. Obviously, he cannot say for sure, but what he can say for sure is that he has never had a problem of endurance. Even outside of armwrestling, he can run miles no problem considering how much he weighs. So endurance-wise, he feels comfortable where he is right now.
SPEAKER_02: And I guess we will all see who has better results.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that endurance, he believes so, that endurance is the least concerning thing to beat Devon. He thinks that he needs to be strength-wise prepared for Devon and he's making this type of goal to be strength-wise improved and also meanwhile will improve his endurance as well. And he also said that it will come up to the who is in better shape when they face each other and
SPEAKER_03: That's basically what he's prepared for. He doesn't really think that endurance is the most concern. So basically, Gennady says that if the match and the power is balanced, he thinks that he can outlast Levin.
SPEAKER_03: All right. Yes. Yes. He's confident. Yeah. Wow. Wow. And Devon, what are you thinking about all this? He's showing you his thumb. Well,
SPEAKER_04: I think that the match will be very interesting. When I see it, I see it many different ways, but when I see it my very favorite way, small parts of Gennady will break. One small part here, one small part here, one small part until he has no teeth.
SPEAKER_04: no arms no legs no nothing and he's just lying there lying there and then i will come and finish him will you make him submit you will wait till he submits well he may not but he will have nothing left to fight with oh okay he will he will just he'll be like he'll be like uh like a cow
SPEAKER_04: it had its horns cut off legs cut off lying on the on the pasture just but still alive still alive moving but not effective not effective no and then i'll have to come in and right through the heart
SPEAKER_03: Right through the heart. Go ahead, Roman. Go ahead, Roman. Okay, okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what to say, but I think it's a good thing that everything is going well. From my point of view, I think it's a good thing. It's a good thing to have children. It's not a bad thing to have children. It's a good thing to have children. I don't think it's a bad thing. I think it's a good thing to have children.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think, what do you think about it? I think about it from a different point of view. I think about it from a different point of view. I think about it from a different point of view. I think about it from a different point of view.
SPEAKER_02: You remember what he did against Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_03: against Michael Todd when he was screaming to Michael Todd. So basically, this is what he said. He said that Devon will be eventually, he's going to go in Kings move. He will be so tired that even his legs, Devon's legs, would not withstand the weight of Devon. And he will just be there. And finally, he will gain some
SPEAKER_03: um some some type of composure to get up and see what's going on and then he would finish him and he also said that what he did against michael todd like non-stop these type of surges and screaming to stand up he will be way like 10 times more against the devil
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_03: he's gonna he's gonna say that he's really he's saying that he he has this suggestion that you you can even like have no 30 seconds pause like right after first round switch sides go right switch sides go really are you hearing this i mean if they want to come back to the table earlier than that it's up to them but i mean they they
SPEAKER_03: I mean, it's their choice. He's saying that he can even not take a full pause after rounds. He can just be asleep. Wow. Can I tell you something, my friend? Do you not think that this guy is different about endurance than the previous guys that you met in your entire life? You're asking this question. Are we saying these kind of things? You know, the things may not go as, you know,
SPEAKER_03: I you know they will always folks you want six rounds, because he wants to help him, but now, whenever he heard about the 30 seconds or something you hear that again because he wants to say he's not really. But he's pretending like that, but I am really thinking of getting out is to ask him if he's sorry that one, but you know.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, yes. So, Gena, you know, we all agree that this is something that needs to be addressed, but your analysis shows that there is a lot of work to be done. I mean, you are not the only one who has to deal with this issue. That is my opinion. Because why do we need to deal with this issue?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, that's why this is the challenge for Gennady. And he's saying that just like Devon is sure that he could tire him out, Gennady out, why is he so sure? Has he ever seen Gennady exhausted, laying in there somewhere?
SPEAKER_03: uh doing the unrested match no and so that's why he's that's where he's coming from he's saying the same thing he has seen they have all lost several times obviously but he has also never seen that and he thinks the same people keep trying to fight no you know that movie oh yeah
SPEAKER_03: And also, does Gennady realize that Devon hurt his bicep against a Georgian? And Devon's training partner hurt his bicep against a Georgian. And does he realize that this Gennady guy is coming for revenge and payback against another Georgian? You know,
SPEAKER_03: The Georgians say that the way the Prokopchuk people lived in the past, they used to sit on their knees and sit on their knees. And now, the Georgians say that it's not true, because when you go to your country, you sit on your knees and sit on your knees.
SPEAKER_03: So that's the reason is why, uh, why he got injured and Canadians get injured this deck in Georgia. He eats stuff like this. And in Canada, you only eat like rice or pancakes or something like that. You can visit one week before you can go to Istanbul so he can feed you there.
SPEAKER_04: I'll look forward to that very much. There's something very important that just came to me, and this is my gift to Gennady, okay? My gift. Because it's important for, you know, athletes to visualize how things are going to be on the day of the fight. And there was this movie that came to mind. What is the name of that movie? It's this famous British comedy.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, it's a British comedy, something about knights and stuff. There's a famous scene where they have this knight and he's fighting and they cut off his leg and he's like, okay, you're done. He's like, get back here, get back here. And then they cut off his other leg. He's like, get back here. And they cut off his arm and he's still fighting and he's standing there. I think it's very important
SPEAKER_03: to consider how he's gonna feel with no arms and no legs it's very important you know um what's the name of that movie joe and i can't remember just check check the chat roman probably somebody is saying what it is do you feel yourself devon do you feel yourself like dexter or something
SPEAKER_04: Not like Dexter. It's not really about me. I mean, it's more about Gennady. Monty Python. Monty Python. Monty Python, yeah. Remember when the guy gets all his stuff cut off? Tell Gennady he should watch Quest for the Holy Grail, and he should think of himself as that guy. That's exactly what he's going to feel like when he faces me. OK, I will tell.
SPEAKER_03: It's a Montepetone film, and the plot of this film is that, you know, people don't know what to do, they don't know what to do, and they don't know what to do, and they don't know what to do, and they don't know what to do, and they don't know what to do, and they don't know what to do, and they don't know what to do, and they don't know what to do, and they don't know what to do, and they don't know what to do, and they don't know what to do,
SPEAKER_02: There is no way to get rid of it. If you don't get rid of it, you will lose your life. You will lose your life, right? You will lose your life, right?
SPEAKER_03: You should be careful what you're saying because it will be as if you would wish during the match for Gennady's arm to stop at some point and stop just surging and opening your arm. You said that your arm cannot be opened and he will open that arm and stretch that wide. And he said that he will also make you wish that Gennady just stop.
SPEAKER_02: It will happen. It will happen. And the fourth one will leave, and the fourth one will leave. And the fourth one will leave. And the fourth one will leave. And the fourth one will leave. And the fourth one will leave. And the fourth one will leave. And the fourth one will leave. And the fourth one will leave. And the fourth one will leave.
SPEAKER_03: All this talking that you just did and you were going to do during the match will amplify Gennady's will to prepare even better. Right now, as of we speak here, he gets like 50% more power to go and will to go and train because right after this talk, he will go gym to train. And he said that
SPEAKER_03: he will make you feel like to ask Gennady to somehow just stop. And he said that he's not going to stop. And in fourth round, after 3-0, in fourth round, he will stop just to make sure that people will see exhausted them. You know, the thing is, all this is a really nice idea. This is all a really nice fantasy. But the truth is, is somebody's going to probably stop
SPEAKER_04: And it might even be round one round one. Oh my God. Would that be bad? Like to have, because you see the thing is with me. Oh, where'd he go? Where'd he go? Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Me. I almost never pin, never, never. And if I do,
SPEAKER_04: And I think there's a pretty good chance that I get hand control on Gennady. He's going to come forward and he will continue to fight, but I will be in an advantage position. I will have the advantage. So no matter how good he thinks his endurance is, he will burn faster than me. And when he's fully burnt out in round one, he will have to come to the table again.
SPEAKER_04: And again, and he doesn't just have to quit once. He has to quit three times. And that is terrible. That's like strike one, strike two, strike three. You're out. I mean. I will translate. Yeah, he hears I will translate.
SPEAKER_03: No problem if he takes control, he can do this.
SPEAKER_03: It's easy from you, Devon, to talk about since you are coming from the wings against little guys, but imagine 150 kg full power coming right at you. That's going to be tough.
SPEAKER_03: And then you can talk if you stop here. No problem. Listen, Roman, did you tell him that he will have to come to table three times and he's going to quit all those three times? Did you tell him this? I told him about first round. I will tell all three. So
SPEAKER_03: There is a supermarket, Brian Johnson. He's going to kill himself if that happens. No, no, no. How are you so certain in that what you're saying?
SPEAKER_03: It's just... Well, the entire Devon's career, he was, like, cheered by people that he has, like, endurance like a titan, you know, and he's, like, the most endurable athlete arm wrestler in the history of arm wrestling, but
SPEAKER_03: that will crush and shatter right next to gennady's match you're gonna bring your multiple towels so that uh get cleaned by your sweat do you remember in the movie that you starred in that you had to jump across that chasm
SPEAKER_04: and you knew it was going to be too far, so you asked to get thrown. You said, throw me, throw me across the chasm. But the problem is nobody's going to be able to throw you this time, Gennady. It's just going to be you, and you're not going to be able to jump across. You know the movie I'm talking about, right, Gennady? Can you repeat the name? I will tell you.
SPEAKER_03: movie name of the movie if you said oh he was i mean gennady was in lord of the rings right do you do you do you know then do you remember in that movie how uh that guy uh smashes the hammer
SPEAKER_02: sledge to people yeah but in the end he couldn't jump across the bridge without somebody throwing him and this time he's gonna have to jump and nobody's gonna be there
SPEAKER_03: okay about this uh movie reference uh okay no problem but he's saying that how about your weight your weight gain devon because he thinks kind of pity about how small you are compared to him so why don't you gain some more weight so that you will have no excuses that you were lighter than i don't think i really need to i think that the thing is is probably if we were to come together and we both get rid of all of our fats
SPEAKER_03: that I'm probably 30 kilos heavier than him. So you say quality muscle you have 30 kilos heavier than him. Quality, quality. My friend. Shout out to Hermes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: hey listen i remember when we both pulled like a hundred that's equality my friend that's equality yeah
SPEAKER_03: you don't even have one that's left one that's left one it doesn't count since he left the heavyweight division he's only gotten fatter me
SPEAKER_03: all the muscle right in my thumb see the thing is my thumb has gotten three times the size 30 percent more thumb let me read this to protest people you know brian johnson everyone has a lot of haters because he is good he is the man oh where did it go he is the man one second sorry it moved down
SPEAKER_03: Because we waited. It's not about hatred. Gennady just said that how many people love in Georgia Devon. So it's, it's, I guess, I guess he meant worldwide, not Georgia. Okay. Yeah. Devon is the man. He is not worried about Gennady and he will face Hermes at some point. Much love from Oklahoma. Thank you, Brian Johnston. And let me, a few, a few more, and then we can slowly finish table. Jackson, thank you for your support. After this match, Devon needs to knock Jerry.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know why this moving, you know, sorry. Devon needs to knock Jerry off. He's high horse. He thinks he's riding on. Devon will humiliate Jerry. That is why Jerry is dodging him. He knows Devon knows how to shut him down. Thank you for your super chat table. And I think two more.
SPEAKER_03: bronze pitbull devon who are your current top 10 open category arm masters he is asking you what are your top 10 so not sure about how about top five at least yeah that's 10 is a lot we go levon and then i'm gonna say together i'll say
SPEAKER_04: Ermes and Dennis. Yeah. And I'll say in the next pool, the next pool, you have people like Gennady and Alex Kordetcha and Dave Chafee. Where is Dave on that list? Where is Dave on that list?
SPEAKER_04: Me? No, I'm a heavyweight. I don't even, I'm not in the, I'm not in the top 10. I'm like probably around 40. Gennady is probably, I'd say he's in the pool beneath Hermes and Dennis. I think that there's a pool that consists of Dave, Vitaly, Alex Kredecha, Gennady,
SPEAKER_04: artem morozov and they're all in kind of like a little pile it's hard to sort out exactly so there's maybe like five guys in there that are very interesting yeah yeah and then anytime they can beat each other you know depending on the form yes maybe but i feel like levon is on top and then i think that i think that ermy's and and i know i get a lot of criticism but i think dennis is in that group too
SPEAKER_04: i and i think that i think that beneath that there's a lot of people and dennis might be like three ermies you know it's that is how much is it proven proven you know yeah yours is opinion while ermes really proved something but i don't think that army's out of reach for a lot of these guys too like i'm curious about a rematch with alex alex kardeccia
SPEAKER_04: that's interesting to me there's a lot of there's a lot of interesting matchups like I don't think that there's clear separations I don't like to think about it like one two three four five I feel like you just tell about the level level of the guys here a pool there yeah but yeah he's pretty good he's pretty good
SPEAKER_03: There is another scripture, Psalm 789, that will show Gennady the hand tattoo he needs to see and take influence, quit. You know what that means, Gennady? Gennady, that's a very good question. It means quit.
SPEAKER_03: So Devon, you might as well also tattoo on your hand like you are the champion because you keep not pulling the big guys. Oh, good. I see him doing his good training now.
SPEAKER_04: That's good. I saw in the video that he's climbing in a different way. This is his best chance. This is his best chance for doing anything with me. This is my training over here. I go over here. And I do this all day long. All day.
SPEAKER_02: I just do this all day. It has to be a really resistant belt. That belt looks very weak. Look how thick this one is. OK, Douglas Erich, he says that
SPEAKER_03: nice haircut engine thank you my friend devon is in for a long day and danny madarius thank you can you grow an awesome beard like gennady has you want to grow a beard like gennady has oh back i couldn't hear uh they're asking if you can grow a beard like gennady
SPEAKER_04: no no no when i compete with gennady i'll be clean shaven and professional oh you want me to take his barber no not not that clean not that okay okay okay the only way i go to the barber is if we do crusty the clown haircut okay okay yeah i will i'll do crusty the clown
SPEAKER_03: okay bubbles devon how about mohawk tell them whatever you need to hear engen so you get them to the barber and then you know what to do you know what to do okay okay and if you resist if you resist then i should you wouldn't mind right if i should use force
SPEAKER_03: authorized use of necessary force yes you heard that you heard that you have a constant you have a concept you heard it okay bubbles is asking how about a mohawk haircut like reverse touch to drive reverse reverse crusty the clown style yeah okay the super chest finish anyway so uh very quickly so what i understand that devon is saying that he's gonna make
SPEAKER_03: Gennady quit, and Devon, Gennady will be asking for, please, a little bit more time, please, more time, you know, before I come to the table next round. And then Gennady is saying that it's not going to happen, right? Yeah, Gennady is saying that Devon will be asking her to show mercy and just stop surging, then stop power. Okay, ask Gennady, after round one, who is going to ask for more time to rest to others?
SPEAKER_03: This is working very well. I'm very, very pleased with everything that I'm hearing. Makes me very happy. He is too. He is too. Looks like your opponent
SPEAKER_04: mentally i think his car doesn't have reverse shifts is all forward that's perfect that's you know if you were gonna fight a car and one had reverse and the other didn't i'd be pretty happy to fight a car that could only go forward
SPEAKER_04: yeah this is what it is look and look at your opponent you have an opponent with a very strong mind very strong mind you're not the quick winner yeah it doesn't make sense but he's facing an opponent with a very strong thumb so you know the strong mind strong
SPEAKER_03: not interested nobody's there yeah and anyone who are watching devon do you suggest these people to buy trading cards does the the those how did you find the quality do we have here at home yeah they're awesome
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah i got two boxes yeah i got yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah in a special box guys you will have signed cards you will be signed by all the athletes with their stats oh i love it yeah yeah thank you yeah yeah yeah i'll i'll probably end up buying them all if you don't sell them
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And there is one more. Would Devon let Gennady breathe from oxygen bottle between rounds? Alexi is asking. He can do whatever he wants. He can do whatever he wants. I don't care. It's going to be awesome. I'm very excited. This match has been a long time coming.
SPEAKER_04: does it look like he is intimidated the way that he's behaving in front of you or he doesn't give very much very much you think he's intimidated by you here's the thing when i see people i i know i know it's okay it's okay like i love the show but as soon as i see ghanadi i know i know my victory is secure
SPEAKER_03: i i'm really looking forward to it it's going to be great do you know what mostly impresses me that you both have mine that is locked to victory like 100 percent that the two strong minds
SPEAKER_03: You know, very strong. He's also very strong in his mind. You are also very strong. And you remember before they come, I told you that this is the biggest opportunity of his life to pull against you. And he said he's extra motivated and he will bring there the best of Ghanazi. Maybe not 30%, but for sure, better than ever. So he's coming there for you, Devon. I don't know. It's very good. That's the way it should be. Do you realize this is the first super heavyweight?
SPEAKER_03: this is this like you you haven't beat right arm super heavyweight eastern european yet super heavyweight have i never done that man because you didn't pull many you didn't pull me you didn't pull you only pulled that one and who else right arm you didn't i mean super heavyweight division jeez i mean this is a this is crazy i can't believe this is true listen with right arm i think you pull at the super match paris
SPEAKER_03: levan rudnick and sundries and prudnik pound for pound was considered as the best after he beat the way he beat attackings and then you beat sundries who is the current world champion and you really beat him like dominated way and now i think this is the after levan this is the first super heavyweight guy yeah that will be interesting yeah
SPEAKER_03: Let's see that you will make your superweight right arm 1-1 after Levan match. So this is actually your second superweight match against Eastern Europeans. Well, we'll see then. We'll see. Gennady, you've got to watch those movies to get prepped up. Don't worry so much about your training. Just watch those two movies.
SPEAKER_02: if you want i'll post the link i'll post the link
SPEAKER_03: he said that fortunately this is not this is not that UFC or boxing or such a type of uh sport because he's so uh right now like hyped to actually deliver what he wants to deliver he may actually uh harm you way more if it was seven seven you you get the guy
SPEAKER_03: out of his cave. Now he wants to just crush you. Not only beat you in arm wrestling, but he wants to just crush you. He said he's going to hit you countless times that you're going to beg him to stop hitting me. Enough. He's going to... He said he's only going to stop in fourth round so that make people watch how exhausted Devon looked like. Oh. He's only going to stop in fourth round. The flesh is weak. The flesh is weak.
SPEAKER_04: he can think whatever he wants but the wrist is non-compliant he he said we don't miss no problem anyways are you are you intimidated by him no how can why would i be into he has a beard who has who has a beard like that and and is actually intimidating he reminds me of michael todd
SPEAKER_03: This beard has its meaning. That's why he's carrying it and you should actually really be scared about that one. It just reminds me of Michael's beard.
SPEAKER_03: Which one, from the WAL or Dubai? No, no, no, the last one. The last one. No, WAL. Yeah. OK. No, OK. Oh.
SPEAKER_02: Basically, he just broke down your match against...
SPEAKER_03: he said that none of you were actually attacking you you both were like in defensive position and it happened that you got up faster and you just finished it so basically he said that mmt was not uh attacking you and for sure
SPEAKER_03: Arm wrestling is when you are standing at the table, not like under the table somewhere else. What you're doing down there, just stand up and pull. He felt lonely because he could only see arm of Michael Todd. He was like, where is Mike? He felt lonely against Michael Todd. He wants you to stand up and pull.
SPEAKER_04: I look forward to your trophy very much, Gennady. I really look forward to it. Hey, best of luck in your training. I want you to know I'm very likely going to beat you. And you're very likely going to have to quit three times. Very likely. So just keep it in your mind so you're not surprised. But listen, I have to go.
SPEAKER_02: I have another meeting that I got to get to. I will translate them what you said, but he wants to .
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he said, I mean, you are Russia, Russia, Russia.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he's saying that this match is not going to be anything unlikely to any other matches that you have ever had there. Because when you're going to go in King's Move, he's not going to just attack. He's just going to stay here and wait until you get up and then finish. He's not fool enough to go there and waste his own power. What do you think? When you are under the table, he will just wait there. No, no, no. First of all, this is okay. This is okay. This is foul.
SPEAKER_02: this it's okay it's false there is no under table but this he can do it exactly what i want to hear it's exactly what i want to hear
SPEAKER_04: And this is going to be my greatest victory ever. But listen, I'm late. I have to go. I wish you all the best with everything except for you, Gennady. Except for you. You, not so much. Engen, Roman, have a great day. Gennady. You too, Danny.
SPEAKER_03: I will translate them. Take care. I got to go. Later, guys. Take care, though. Thank you, my friend. Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: uh andy he wants me to tell you like all this talk that devon did and we just did with each other he got so much like motivated to punish devil enormously that he will be the second georgian guy who will just freeze devon in one place and make him look tired and then just finish
SPEAKER_02: so because he got so much he left the chat but he will not be able to escape from the armistice table
SPEAKER_03: Where will he go? I mean, this is what I wanted to see. I mean, I don't really care who wins. I wish both guys the best. But I wanted Gennady to be fired up and bring the table. I wanted this to be a little bit personal, not so much, as much as we needed for the table. And this happened now. And from now on, it will just go that way. And I'm very happy. And there is a super chat. Andrin Meyer, we watch.
SPEAKER_03: We both are so confident to win, so let's make a deal. If Gennady wins, Devon has to shave his hair. If Devon wins, Gennady has to shave his beard. Deal, or are you both scared too much? My friends, sorry, I just saw this. Devon left and we cannot ask him, but we can ask more questions to Gennady before he leaves. So now Gennady is more motivated.
SPEAKER_03: and he looks like you know he's just gonna go dash rather die at the table than lose it he's gonna give his all this is yes correct that's the only way he will be called he will be satisfied if canadi wins by uh like uh anything other than just using 100 he will not be that satisfied as long as he uses 100 even if he somehow loses he will still be uh but asking me did it become a little bit more personal not not really but you know a little bit
SPEAKER_03: Yes, I agree with your comments, and I think it's important to talk about it, and I think it's a good motivation for both of us, and I think it's a very personal thing, but it's also very important, and I think it's a good motivation.
SPEAKER_03: No, actually, right now, because it's fresh and it's hot, so right now he feels very upset and so much anger to unleash over Devon that he will make sure that Devon will think that, oh, man, I wish I was not armistice. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: What's that again? Should I repeat? So basically Gennady said that since this is like a fresh for the day, I just finished this hot topic. So he said that I'm so, so much, feel so much anger and I'm so kind of upset. Devon angered me so much that I will make sure he wishes, Devon wishes at the table that he has never been armistead at all.
SPEAKER_03: oh he's gonna crush them so much okay now what we are talking about is exactly this yeah and that is why angry white blur st ball devon for me no ball devon for the war with gennady hoping him for everything you do i thank you guys for your support and okay
SPEAKER_03: So, I will ask him some of his other matches. What does he think about left-arm, Laletin and Tobias? Laletin and Tobias, I don't know what to say. They are great sportsmen.
SPEAKER_02: He is a sportsman, maybe because of his weight. I don't know if it's because of his weight or because of his weight. I think it's because of his weight. 30% of his weight is because of his weight. It's true that he has a lot of weight.
SPEAKER_03: Considering how experienced La Lettine is and what he has accomplished in this sport and how much he shows his level, he thinks that 60% to 40% La Lettine is favorite. But he's still unsure about La Lettine's left arm. He's not that much confident, but he's saying like 60% to 40% La Lettine. Okay, then how about David Chepi versus Revas Lutvice? Revas Lutvice is going to tell us.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that 50-50 in this case, endurance-wise, both are around the same level because none of them are too much endurance monsters.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Revas is in even better shape now since his last pool against Morozov. He's really, really gained much and he's in better shape. So he thinks, considering how strong Dave is also, he says that like it's 50-50 depends on whoever will be better at the table that day.
SPEAKER_03: whoever wakes up in a better mood you know just like it's going to be really tough fight and great match and great battle he's saying another one
SPEAKER_02: No, I don't know. As I said, I'm sure that Zirakashvili is my son-in-law. Zirakashvili is my third son-in-law, which is why I don't know his last name. I don't know. He was born in 1850.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that he's cheering for both Rezo and Rivas and Irakli, but their opponents are both very well-matched and really good. He's saying that Irakli has gained after Jon's match. He's gaining daily. He's gaining some power bit by bit. So he will deliver different shape than he delivered lastly on East versus West. But on the other hand, Kittleville is also true warrior, really good.
SPEAKER_03: and he's saying 50 50 and he said that well done again that was a really good matchup yeah great match is tremendous battle yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you and what does he think about pauline uh uh sasho and uh paul right uh there was a slight oh yeah yeah i don't know yeah
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I heard the name of Andrew or something. I was confused.
SPEAKER_03: All these matches you are setting up, Engin, this time, he's like speechless. He cannot really say, like he's saying 50-50, you know, this is so much good matches that's kind of unpredictable. He's saying 50-50. He cannot say that much.
SPEAKER_03: so he's saying that uh the version of sasho we have seen against iraqli would would lose against paul because that was not sasha's best shape he says but if sasho is in his peak shape or in his best shape then it will be a really really good and tough battle for paul so so he's saying the 50 50.
SPEAKER_03: 50 50 he said yeah 50 50. yeah benji thank you for uh sharing the sign cards guys uh more than half has been sold probably i can say that 60 65 percent and just because last time you guys asked you know if it's finished so don't be late if you want to buy them
SPEAKER_03: And another one, Alijan Muratov versus Cody Merritt, left arm. Yeah, Muratov, Muratov.
SPEAKER_03: He's really a good check, good one. And how about Zurab versus Rob Vigeons? This is R.V.J. Romaris and I'm talking about Zurab now. Are you talking about him? Yes. What are you talking about? Who is Zurab and who is Romaris? Zurab and Beridze are R.V.J.'s friends, Rob Vigeons. Zurab... Does he know who he is? Does he know Rob?
SPEAKER_02: He's saying, obviously, he knows RBJ.
SPEAKER_03: it's it's really and he just coming from his own experience he just said that uh uh when once you have such a big pause no matter uh uh you how much you try you cannot be the uh the guy who just stopped
SPEAKER_03: Zubair Bhatnagar- Back then, like let's say years ago and shows up today will not be the same, it will take time to get back. Zubair Bhatnagar- And he said from his own experience so that's why he's saying that obviously he knows rj but doesn't think that that will be best version of rj we have seen last day lately, so he thinks that will be in also very good shape right now. Zubair Bhatnagar- He is Rob has not stopped his training and he's getting that. yeah yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Tell him that soon we're going to rent an apartment for Zurab here since he comes to every event, six events in a row.
SPEAKER_03: He's like maniac in armwrestling, Zurab. That's how much he loves. And Zurab also told me personally, he watches every matches. He knows everyone in armwrestling. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. That is why, you know, I like to see Zurab here every event. Thank you, my friend. Buy the cars. They are amazing. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. You know, you know the quality. And
SPEAKER_02: Basho Saginashvili versus Adam Wojcicki. You see the smirk on his face, smile? Yeah, I see the smile because he's proud of Basho, he's young.
SPEAKER_02: There is a legend, a long time ago, a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago, it's a long time ago
SPEAKER_03: okay uh so he said first of all uh sorry again i could not hear he said he will be a future legend yeah yeah yeah in at some point like soon relatively soon then later he will become uh really like gains fame and becomes a legend in this boat because he has so much you cannot get famous i mean legend soon but maybe
SPEAKER_03: He said, actually, I will correct myself. He said like in future. He didn't specify. Yeah, yeah. So and he starts saying by thanking you, Engin, for hearing his suggestions about Baciu and setting up this match, because you also remember we all three were at the same table. We remember how much he wanted this match and he thanked you for setting it up.
SPEAKER_03: and uh he said that bacho will win even though the uh even though adam is also really uh strong and he adam is very strong how strong he was last last night we saw him but he thinks bacho is stronger like you know bacho he still thinks that bacho will win because he knows how strong
SPEAKER_03: Do you think, Andy, now he has the question for you. Do you think that Adam would beat Zurab right-handed? What do you think? I mean, if he stops him, it will be a long match. I don't know who is going to finish, but Adam also has very good endurance. And does Gennady imply that Macho can beat Zurab?
SPEAKER_03: Let's say, if a person is a person, if a person is a person, if he or she is a person, if he or she is a person, if he or she is a person, if he or she is a person, if he or she is a person, if he or she is a person, if he or she is a person, if he or she is a person,
SPEAKER_03: So he's saying Zurab and Bacho are like 50-50 or could be slightly Bacho favorite, slightly. But 50-50, he said. Because top roll, right? Top roll, not with the wood. It's versatile. Biceps, top roll. No, no, no. Can he beat Zurab inside as well? Ah, Zurab Tarogorari Ushidniko Egegikha.
SPEAKER_02: He said that they have officially never met, officially, unofficially, Zurab and Bachu have never pulled right arm, but he cannot ignore both arms.
SPEAKER_03: So, he said that, considering his own experience about Zurab's and Bacho's power in biceps, he said that they are like 50-50, they are relatively the same, and also he pointed out one fact that Bacho is not actually a hooker.
SPEAKER_03: and he said that yeah he said that uh to grip up zurab is easier for him personally than to grip up macho like he feels more comfortable gripping up surah and uh whoever uh faces each other if they faced each other today he doesn't know who would be or uh macho i understand okay
SPEAKER_03: Thank you for your superset. It takes too long for the referees to notice a low humerus angle. Shouldn't we allow the athlete to make the call? And then if he is wrong, punish him with a loss in the round or give him a foul. I don't think that athletes should make any calls, my friend. Thank you for your supersets. And okay, then the...
SPEAKER_03: Others, let's go Daniel Prokopchuk versus Douglas Ehrich. Douglas is the one that beat Ray in the last event, if Gennady remembers. Daniel Prokopchuk and Douglas Ehrich. Douglas Ehrich is the one that beat Ray in the last event, if Gennady remembers. Daniel Prokopchuk and Douglas Ehrich.
SPEAKER_03: Egaris Estim. The Magorshoris Raspikrov. Prokofchuk Bagaryevich. Prokofchuk. Prokofchuk is favorite. He is really, really tough, tough to battle against. Can you ask Gennady, Arif versus the Zeranovi? Arif versus, Arif Ida, Zeranovi. Arif. Arif. No doubt, no doubt, Arif is a favorite.
SPEAKER_03: he thinks i understand and brendan ssr versus uh uh remind me andy what's their weight uh on this one because i think it's like 85 category 85. um
SPEAKER_02: It's also a really good match, also a very good match. So he's saying about Sambushia mental right now, like mental power,
SPEAKER_03: has been amplified and he thinks maybe it's all because of his uh state right now he's a champion he's a title winner so all these like helmets and uh shield maybe that all encouraged him and he's also mentally very really motivated and prepared right now david samushia he has never seen such a version of samushia so he thinks that he thinks that samusha is the favorite uh
SPEAKER_03: Yes, he does. Another question. Is there anyone on this tour, in his opinion, since he thinks that Samusha is the favorite against Brandon? Like, for example, if Zolev would go down to 85 kilo, who would be the favorite between Zolev and Samusha? But who knows? Maybe Brandon is going to be Samusha. But since he thinks that Samusha is the best. I will ask his opinion. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. He's saying 85 kg, Davit will be winner, 90 kg, Zolovev will be winner. So 85 kg. So he's saying that.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so he's saying that in 85 kg, David Samushia is favored against anyone on this search. Yes, against anyone, David Samushia under 85 kg is favored. Tell him that there may be some old wolves that may be secretly getting ready.
SPEAKER_03: Who is that old wolf? I wonder. I don't know. And Brian Salter, please tell me, is there a way I can purchase
SPEAKER_03: sign East versus West six cards. And Devon, from one soldier to another, you are my favorite. Good luck. My friend, East versus West six trading cards. They are all sold out, my friend. That is why I'm telling you guys now not to miss the East versus West seven cards because they are also going fast. I can tell you how much.
SPEAKER_03: more than 60 percent more than 60 percent are sold out and we have two months they won't be left so and we won't be making more um anyway so anyway so thank you very much Gennady my friend you are a warrior and you are stronger here even more than here you are here very very strong but here even stronger here
SPEAKER_03: even stronger than both. And I wish you the best because your opponent is also the same way. This is very, very unique super match. I just can't wait. Devon personally told me that he has been wanting to pull against you for last 15 years. And finally, this match is happening and I'm very happy. I just can't wait. I just can't wait. Like,
SPEAKER_03: What's going to happen there when the referee says, go? I just can't wait. And of course, he's not going to tell us where he's going to go. And so tell him what I said. I will still ask. I will still ask. OK. First, I will translate. Yes.
SPEAKER_03: but it is not easy to understand it. And in the world, if you don't understand it, it is not easy to understand it. That's it.
SPEAKER_03: This is what he's going to do. He's going to crush him. And then just eat him.
SPEAKER_03: And after that, you're going to tell Devon never face another Georgian again, right? He said that it would have been even better if you had said it when Devon was here. Devon is finished now. Devon is finished.
SPEAKER_03: It's because Gennady has already this mindset. Gennady said that he has already this mindset. There's no risk here. And even any random drunk Georgian will show up at the table, Devon will be rejecting and will not have a plan. After this podcast here, everything after what Devon said,
SPEAKER_03: He says that Devon is finished. That's what he said. Peace by peace, it will be vice versa and even worse. There is no rescue.
SPEAKER_03: It's great that he's not MMA or something. He's really like... I understand, I understand, yeah. Thanks to them. Genadi, imagine after the match, they will put the videos on YouTube. Option one, you winning, and oppa now, you know? And then two, two, two, two, he's holding you,
SPEAKER_03: And he's saying, fight me, Gennady, fight me. And you are like this. Just think. Just don't forget about May 14. What will happen? It will be put on social media and millions will watch. So be careful. Get ready. You don't want to be in the same position of Khrushchev.
SPEAKER_03: That's what I'm saying. And the second thing is that there are two variants. In fact, in the last two videos, you saw a very popular one. And there are two variants. One variant is that you are like this, you are angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry.
SPEAKER_02: So for second option, since you gave two options of the videos, right? Second option, he says that
SPEAKER_03: okay, Devon may stop him and start saying, like, fight me and stuff like this. But that's all because Gennady wants it so. Maybe Gennady just wants to pretend that he's like, oh, his power is separating, going, going, going. And then, like, one ton or one and a half tons of power just crashes them so hard that it will be piece by piece. You have to take Devon to the hospital in Turkey and then just reassemble back.
SPEAKER_02: He actually will bring for Devon this fixating thing for arm since it's going to be necessary for Devon. It will not be necessary for you to take him in the hospital, he will take care of it.
SPEAKER_03: he's saying this because of watching how devon was using his own uh green hoodie famous green hoodie after the after levan's match we we saw how devon was with his arm and he felt pity about devon right now and he's saying that he's gonna bring specific one for to hold it properly you know for them after after his match
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so thank you, Zain. Can't wait for this match. Huge respects to both competitors. My prediction of winning and not losing. Anyway, so thank you very much, Gennady. Thank you very much, Roman.
SPEAKER_02: I am very happy to be here in Georgia and I want to say that everything is going well and I am very happy to be here. I am not a sportsman. I am very happy to be here and I want to say that everything is going well and I want to say that everything is going well.
SPEAKER_03: Before the finish, he almost forgot because he was so concentrated on Devon and the subject, and he wanted to share his condolence and his sadness about the event that happened in Turkey, because not only his understanding community around Gennady, but also an entire family and everybody he knows in Georgia was really frustrated. I see that on social media.
SPEAKER_03: Thank him. He wishes the peace. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Anyway, so hope to see you again, Adi, my friend, very soon. Two months. Take care yourself and just tell him to not to get injured. Be careful. He's training smart. Yeah.
