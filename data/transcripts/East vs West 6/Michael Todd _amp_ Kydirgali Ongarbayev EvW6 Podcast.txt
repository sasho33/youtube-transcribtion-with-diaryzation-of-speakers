SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Hello. Can you make the camera a little bit closer or not? What? Can you bring the phone a little bit closer to you or not? Okay. This is normal. Yeah, yeah. You can turn to yourself. We would like to see you too. Such a world champion, Mazgan Shamir.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you. Thank you very much. It was already normal. Yeah, yeah. You can also turn a little bit yourself as well. It's okay. We can see you as well. Maybe I talk with you as well. Yeah. It's better. Yeah. Maybe more. Michael said he may be late a few minutes. Is that three to five minutes? He may be late. So let's start.
SPEAKER_02: let's start uh paulo uh before uh before john bersing match we also had a podcast with uh kidder galley and that that translation wasn't like so clear and so we decided that you know maybe this time uh you help us sure can you ask him how has he been after the during the waft he won the left arm and before right arm he got like something like
SPEAKER_03: Hi, my name is Pasha. You speak Russian very well.
SPEAKER_03: Listen, he's asking about Vav. When you played, you won with your left hand, and then something happened with your right hand. Did you get poisoned or what? What happened there? Hi, Pasha. I raised the temperature with my right hand. I got sick. I couldn't get up. You got sick, right? Yes, I got sick.
SPEAKER_03: He just got sick. He had a very high temperature and he couldn't get up. It just was normal, you know, sickness. No food poisoning, just sickness. Okay, he got cold then, probably. Yes. Okay, okay. And how is his shape right now? Is his shape
SPEAKER_03: better than the time that he pulled against John Brzenk? Yes, it's better now.
SPEAKER_02: okay uh yeah now his form is better than when he was pulling john brzenk i understand yeah yeah and uh stylistically does he see michael uh more or less dangerous than uh john it doesn't have to be stylistically like generally
SPEAKER_03: Does he expect a harder match or same difficulty or easier match? How does he see it? Peter, how do you rate this match against Michael? Do you think it will be harder than with John Brzenk or easier? I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: um
SPEAKER_03: okay okay uh yeah he he cannot answer for sure uh he said yeah with john it was not easy but michael is a very uh very good sportsman so he he cannot tell if it's gonna be harder but it's gonna be hard too it's gonna be hard but he doesn't know it's gonna be harder or not yes he doesn't he doesn't know and and another one how does he see his chances
SPEAKER_04: How do you rate your chances with Michael? How many percent do you think you can win or lose? I can't say anything. I prepared very well. I'm already ready to fight.
SPEAKER_03: okay uh he said he can he cannot give any predictions percentile in uh uh you know the chances wise but he said that uh his form is very good he's uh ready and he said yeah that's it it's it needs to be on the table right now that's it he said that he's ready of course he's coming to win yeah and and if he wins
SPEAKER_03: Who does he want to pull next if he wins? If he wins, he wants Devon Larratt. Okay, another question, if he wins.
SPEAKER_02: if he wins, he's already the title holder for the 105 kilo. And if he wins, he will remain. And Devon is 115 kilo title holder. In which category, because Devon said he would be fine to go down and win 105 category as well to have second title.
SPEAKER_03: and would he wish him to pull on his own title or in 115 kg title okay uh okay uh
SPEAKER_03: He asks, do you want to fight Devon Larratt in what category? Do you want him to drop to your category, to 105? Or are you okay if you fight him in the 115 category, in 115 kg? Do you understand, Khyder Ghalib? Do you understand the question? Well, let it be 115, there is no question there.
SPEAKER_02: okay he said he said that he wanna fool him uh and it doesn't really matter which category no questions asked 115 if he beats michael and remains as the title holder he wants to pull uh devon larat and it doesn't matter let for example that devon chooses is what he says hello michael how are you my friend
SPEAKER_02: I am well. I'm connecting to my, sorry, real quick. My Wi-Fi is not doing well, so I had to disconnect. One second. Okay. I think I'm good. What's up, guys? Hey, Michael. Good to see you, Michael. Good to see you. You were not here, so we were talking about your match with Ongarweb. Ongarweb said that he knows that it's going to be a tough match. He doesn't know if it's going to be tougher than John Bersink match.
SPEAKER_02: or not he said that the table will show this he said he's ready he's coming and the rest will be you know at the table and then i said if you win of course he's coming to me the same as you are you are also coming to me if you win you know who do you want to pull and he said he would like to pull devon and let's talk about you michael lately we saw you very heavy on the scale how is that going first of all
SPEAKER_00: All right, well, I weighed in again this morning. I actually, I was doing pretty good. I put on 23 pounds in five days because we celebrated Christmas. And that was just a lot of bloat, right? I got 21 pounds, a little over 21 pounds off.
SPEAKER_00: gained back like a pound and a half yesterday because I had carbs. Because I hadn't had any carbs. So I wanted to spike my metabolism. I think I'll be down five pounds tomorrow from where I was today. So I have to make 242s this weekend. It's my first event of my quest for 100. So I'll make 242s this week. And that'll give me two weeks to go ahead and make the rest of the cut. So no problem. And how is the bicep doing? Man...
SPEAKER_00: I'm not at my best, but I'll be the best that I can be right now. I do think I'm strong, and I think the bicep's healthy. So I just, you know, it's just a mental, most of this is gonna be mental for me, just believing that the arm will hold up.
SPEAKER_00: You know what I mean? I think the arm's plenty strong. It's just, I'm going to have to, that's what this weekend's about, is getting some ready goes in to see how it holds up. Because I know Arn Gervais is going to be hitting me really hard. He's going to be really strong. Probably one of the most explosive guys I've arm wrestled in a while. So I got to be ready for that. But yeah, super strong young man. So I think I'll be fine.
SPEAKER_03: Guys, let me real quick just some translation for him so he knows what we're talking about. I think he has with Mazgan. Mazgan, did you translate to him or no? Yeah, I understand little.
SPEAKER_03: okay okay yeah because michael have no accent that's why
SPEAKER_03: Engin and Michael asked about Michael's weight, because he gained weight, he was a lot heavier. How is the drop going? Well, it's going slowly, everything is fine. So in these outings he is already planning to weigh 110 kg, and by the competition he will be 105 kg, everything is fine.
SPEAKER_03: Michael also asked him how his form is, how his biceps are. He said that the biceps heal well, it doesn't hurt, there are no problems. The form is not the best in life, but it's not bad either. He says, I'm working on it. And he says that there will be the first competition in these small weekends. He will go to them, compete and check at the same time if everything is in place, everything is holding.
SPEAKER_03: And the same question for you, Michael. Michael, you are coming from middleweight.
SPEAKER_02: You're coming from middleweight in the past, talking about like 30 years ago almost. And then you have that ability, that speed and everything. And now I think probably that's why you said that you haven't been pulled someone as quick as Ongarbe for a while, because you have been a super heavyweight. So that when you pull in lighter classes, the category is getting more explosive, right? Is that what you say?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I mean, I just, I can't speak to the category as a whole. I'm speaking as an individual athlete. He possesses a lot of explosive, uh, strength, very versatile. Um, so a lot of it is going to have to be, you know, and, and you're, I mean, there is a certain degree of the lighter arm wrestlers tend to be more explosive. Um, but yeah, I mean, I just, I feel him individually as an athlete is going to be a good test as far as speed and.
SPEAKER_00: explosiveness and stuff i think he's going to be very strong and how do you feel about your new category okay so i'm not going to say that this is a new category i'm just saying i'm making this wait for a shot at a world title yeah i mean next week i might be too set you know the week after this i might be back to 270. you know what i mean so yeah i don't i'm making these weights for a reason i'm making this weight because this was a shot for me to have a shot at a world title
SPEAKER_00: i have great respect for agrabahev as an athlete um but i couldn't get the devin match i couldn't get the prudnik match because he was injured the match that made sense to me was you know who who do i have a shot at regaining some um legitimacy you know uh i'm still cool pulling supers you know it doesn't matter to me i'll do whatever 231 253 and supers in this three weight category you can pull
SPEAKER_00: like anytime you want you just need maybe some some time to be super away and sometimes you'll be 231 right right so the reason i'm actually making this cut is because i have this quest for 100 right my goal for 2023 is to win 100 first place awards well it's a lot easier to do that if i can enter the 242 class and the super class right um so that's the reason i decided to get a little bit lighter so that i could enter multiple classes and have multiple chances at winning
SPEAKER_00: um i was telling rebecca i was like you know this is kind of dumb i should just stay around 260 and have abs and just pull supers you know because they're still masters divisions they're still overall divisions i'm only getting two more chances at each event really 242s and supers but when i when i came up with the idea it made a lot of sense yeah yeah yeah i understand and and if you win against uh on that web who do you want to pull against
SPEAKER_00: I would happily pull Devon for the heavyweight titles, you know. I will pull, okay, so let's just say, let's just say I do come out on top of this match, and that's a big if. This is a big task in front of me. This isn't gonna be a walking apart just because I'm a super heavyweight coming back down to this weight class. Agrabah, I can pull competitively with the super heavyweights.
SPEAKER_00: There is a little bit of difference in the giant super heavyweights out there and their skill level now, I think, to win the last time he was pulling supers. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. But, yeah, this is not going to be an easy task. But if I do come out on top, I would defend the 231 title if that was the match that was offered. I would pull for the 253 title versus Devin. I would pull the winner of Jerry versus Georgie for the super heavyweight. I mean, it doesn't matter. Eventually –
SPEAKER_02: yeah eventually i want them all eventually i want all the time what if devon says that you need to be either uh prudnik or sundries then i would pull you well prudnik is a match i wanted i wanted it yeah guys give give me 30 seconds i will just go ahead it's your summary okay
SPEAKER_03: He asked me if I would always be in the 105th category. I said no, I can weigh more in a week. I don't stick to 105 kg, I can be 115 kg and even super heavy.
SPEAKER_03: He said it doesn't matter. Then he asked him, if he wins, the same question that you have, who he wants. He also said that he wants to fight with Larratt in 115. Then he says, if Larratt manages to win, I will not stop, I will fight in super heavyweights. Then he quickly told that he has such a task for 2023 to win.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you. Yeah? Ready?
SPEAKER_02: Okay. So yeah, I was thinking, I was thinking about that. Uh, like I'm curious about something. Um, whenever, like I talked with Devon, Devon said that you and him pull two or three days before you had a top eight super match against Alex Kordesha.
SPEAKER_02: and only two or three days you bought her and like how come like you decided to pull two three days before top eight super match
SPEAKER_02: with Devon, even if it's a practice or not? Was it because you recovered so quick or is it because you were so confident of your power? Can you ask him how did it happen? He asks and says that before your match in the top eight,
SPEAKER_03: Alex Kurdech, two or three days before you fought Devon Larratt, didn't you fear that your arm would hurt? Or were you so confident in your advantage against Alex that you didn't care? We fought on the left, on the right.
SPEAKER_03: okay yeah they they did not really pull uh the right hands they just you know uh grip up to just you know apply a little bit of pressure but they did not really pull on the right hands but they did pull on the left okay okay that that that is not the story that i directly heard from both devon and uh before but i think he is very um
SPEAKER_02: He likes to keep it very private, as far as I understand. Yeah. Anyway, so and another thing I want to ask on that way, on that way, your opponent, Michael, has been pulling against pullers like Jerry Cadoret, Andrei Pushkar, rest in peace, and Denis Siblenko, and Devon Larratt, and Dave Chaffee, you know, he has been pulling against the super heavyweights.
SPEAKER_02: win or lose he has been very competitive sometimes he won sometimes he lost but even he lost he gave big trouble to these guys so does it i would say does it worry you that he may be now losing weight but whenever i ask him about his sizes especially from the forum he said he did not lose anything at all so looks like michael lost
SPEAKER_02: Fadi Bardawil, Ph.D.: bet, but not not much of muscle so and Michael is talking he's going to make to 31 but he's talking about. Fadi Bardawil, Ph.D.: Making to 17 a very short time, it means that you know it made his body get used to it, but just quickly losing the weight and quickly gain back to us all this worry or concern hunger where.
SPEAKER_03: You know that Michael is a legendary athlete. He fought with everyone, with Andrei Pushkar, Denis Tsyplenkov, Jerry Cadoret, Larratt.
SPEAKER_03: super heavy weight stars. And sometimes he won, sometimes he lost. He says, well, yes, now he's dropping to 105 kg, but he says that in a couple of days he can again weigh, roughly speaking, 120 kg. Does it bother you? Do you worry that he is such a strong, legendary athlete? Or how do you feel about it?
SPEAKER_04: You need to... The sound is off, I see. OK. Well, Michael is a very strong athlete. He's legendary. I respect him. I want to fight such a legendary athlete. I want to win him. I don't worry.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, yeah, he said that he knows that Michael is a very legendary sportsman and he has a lot of respect to Michael. And he said, but I do want to pull the sportsman like this, the higher caliber to be better myself. And he said, if I worry about now, I'm not really worried about, I'm not really concerned because I'm ready and I want to pull, we'll see.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I understand. Yeah, that's gonna be a good match. And another question for Ungarbe. Can you ask him, did he need to train specifically for Michael because of his unorthodox style?
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Peter Gali asks, did you train and prepare for Michael because he has such a specific style of wrestling? Yes, I know a lot of videos of him, how he fights. Yes, I prepared a little bit.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Okay. Yes. He said that. Yes, absolutely. He watched a lot of videos of Michael because of the specific of the, you know, style. And he said, yes, yes, I did prepare specially for Michael. Yeah, that sucks. Michael, Michael. And Michael,
SPEAKER_02: many people uh they believe that to beat you um they need to have that that finishing power you know that that pressure that heavy pressure you know of course after getting positioned to there and then they need to people say that they need the shoulder pressure the joint type of pressure um and many people believe that that needs to be a heavyweight super heavyweight pressure
SPEAKER_02: And do you, how do you see that? I know you both are being like humble, but tell us how you really feel. Does this guy have the, do you think that the finishing pressure that some of the super heavyweights managed to do against you? Can I answer this question? Let him answer first and then you answer. I wanted to hear Pablo's answer. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: uh it's not depends on the uh opponent it depends on michael's uh preparation and health if he is in his best form it doesn't matter who in front of him he will win and we saw that he he has wins on pretty much all the superstars in the heavyweights and super heavyweights uh it's it's it's not depends on on on the uh on that so it depends on the mic you are you are saying that if michael is in shape nobody on the earth can beat him yep
SPEAKER_02: basically because he proved he i love pablo he's awesome just watch the chat now i think you're gonna get a lot of there oh you know you know what i'm fine with that uh i love all my haters because as soon as you have haters you're famous because because oh my god i must be really famous
SPEAKER_02: Of course, Michael. Michael, I will tell you something. You are one of the people in this community, person in this community that, I mean, people are like, how to say, they don't ignore you. That is the success. They either love you so much, or they really
SPEAKER_02: dislike you understand yeah they don't like me they really don't like me yeah yeah but they don't ignore you like you are a type of person that they either love you so much or they really dislike you and it is almost same with the devil as well you understand there are a few people like this that people don't ignore you understand right like yeah yeah like even if some people ignore it's like three percent
SPEAKER_00: out of 100, you understand? Right, right. Well, okay, I'm going to go ahead and answer your question. I like Pablo's answer a whole lot. But here's the deal. Andre Baez is an awesome arm wrestler. He's very, very complete. He has a bit wrist press if needed. We saw him use it against Alex. I mean, he's versatile. He can do everything. On what Pablo said, if I trust my bicep, if I feel confident and I'll stop the match in a position that's
SPEAKER_00: remotely neutral meaning my hand's not terribly compromised i'm not my pronator's not turned you know my palms not turned up if i stopped the match anywhere near those angles and my comp my bicep holds up i believe i win um even if he wasn't a transition i don't think he's quite as long as some of the guys who have been able to pin me you know or um
SPEAKER_00: And the other thing, I haven't arm wrestled on this new table. I haven't arm wrestled on these new elbow pads. These new elbow pads, apparently the guys who've arm wrestled said they notice a difference. Like the little bit extra surface you have front, back, left, right, may help me, you know?
SPEAKER_00: But here's the deal. I'm very excited. I'm going to tell you one thing. I have zero pressure. Although everyone, not everyone, although a lot of people say this is must win for me. Oh, if I don't rent, I should retire. Listen, no one determines when I'm going to quit. I'm never going to quit. This is what I do. I've been doing, I'm in my 30, 30 year of doing this. You win some, you lose some, right? One thing, and I'm going to just tell you the honest to God truth. I have zero pressure anymore. And I'll tell you why.
SPEAKER_00: I am no longer on the rankings. They took me off the top 15 because Brees lost to somebody in that AMC tournament. So now they're ranked and I'm knocked off the ranks. So shit, I got, I'm just having fun, right? So I come into this match with Angerbaev, two professional athletes, two prepared athletes, two experienced athletes. Someone's going to win, someone's going to lose. I mean, I'm hoping I'm going to be the guy that wins.
SPEAKER_00: if i don't i'll just learn from it you know i'll just keep getting better but i do believe honestly i genuinely believe that the best version of me is still to come i've had some very good forms in my life i've been in very good shape but i don't think i've ever been as committed as i am right now rebecca and i are both very very committed to our training to being our best versions of ourselves
SPEAKER_00: Like I said, I'm going to be light a lot this year, 231, 242 throughout the year. But once I accomplish my goal, you will see me. And I think that's going to turn me. I think I'm going to get really, really healthy. I think my tendons are going to heal up. I think all the arm wrestling I'm going to be doing is going to just really temper me, get everything back. I mean, I'm going to be doing wrestling a lot, right? Like Pablo and I both could be doing a lot of tournaments this year. He talked about it when he was here. I think that's going to help me.
SPEAKER_00: level back up, right? I think I just went through a whole bunch of shit, you know? I just, the COVID and nerve damage and a variety of things that happened, I just felt like I've been tested. And now's the time for me to, you know, rise back out of the flames and be, you know, I guess a Phoenix or whatever. But I feel very good about what's coming. Whether it's going to be, you know, in three weeks against Agrabahib, I don't know. But there's nothing that's going to deter me from my goal. And that goal is being the very best version of me I can possibly be.
SPEAKER_02: yeah okay guys now now now give me my 30 seconds wait wait wait a little bit okay okay okay then you can do it yeah michael um um just run after your dreams my friend just just ignore people yeah you have done very big things great things and
SPEAKER_02: you may not be you have not been as successful as before but for me for me i mean it doesn't change the fact that you are a very dangerous person and people who like likes to be sarcastic or something like they are mistaken they are not being respectful enough and also the way that they talk doesn't represent the way that your opponents feel about you you understand if i am asking prudnik to pull michael
SPEAKER_02: And if he is saying, oh, that is very uncomfortable opponent for me, very dangerous opponent. If Prudnik is saying this about you, if Ongar Bayev is saying this about you, the things that you are hearing, then I think that people should respect you at least as much as your opponents do. I don't care if they don't like what I say now. This is exactly how I feel. And I respect you, my friend. That's what I want to say.
SPEAKER_03: i appreciate it whoever's unrespectful block them is that how you're going to transfer yes i will and you have to block everybody who is disrespectful
SPEAKER_03: I know, I know. I'm just joking now.
SPEAKER_03: He has a lot of respect for you. He says, listen, if I can catch in the right angles, so that I don't have to be right next to the pillow, and so that I don't have to be completely on the supinator, you know, unfolded, then I think I can win. He says, Angrabaev is a very fast and strong and fully prepared athlete in all angles. He says he has all the opportunities to win. He says, well, I also have the opportunity to win, so let's fight and we'll see.
SPEAKER_03: He says, listen, I don't have any pressure on me anymore, because I'm not in any rankings anymore, I'm not the first 15 in the world, but I train all the time. He says, yes, there are some injuries, but we heal with them.
SPEAKER_03: And he says, everything will be fine. Believe me, in a year or two I will show a very good form and you will see me. And he will go to a lot of small competitions here in America. He says, everything is fine with me, I'm ready. And he says, my haters, who don't love me, say that it's time for me to retire. He says, no way, I decide for myself when it's time for me to retire.
SPEAKER_02: Somebody just wrote the freedom of speech, and then I'm going to tell him that your freedom ends at the border of other person's freedom, my friend. You can just disrespect as much as you want, but you cannot just come to my chat room and disrespect. I also have freedom of blocking, you understand? Anyways. Engin, you're right.
SPEAKER_02: yeah anyway so okay let's let's talk about some some um okay michael says after this match if he wins okay michael after this match if you win uh and if prudnik says that okay i'm gonna pull you michael but at 105.
SPEAKER_02: it is still okay or you should be able of course oh okay okay so you are ready to defend your title if you win and you are also ready to give a shot for a heavyweight title as well so you're okay absolutely yeah yeah yeah yeah that that's the plan okay i understand and hopefully i mean um like we will see a great battle i don't know what what else we can we can talk about this
SPEAKER_02: and another question for for uh is his form now as good as his top eight form he said even better he said he said about he's better than top eight form yeah oh okay that sucks as well
SPEAKER_03: another question for him um for the next year he's still planning to do 100 kilo buff
SPEAKER_03: or 110 kilos of weight in Kazakhstan, in his country. Kedrgaly asks, are you planning to compete in Kazakhstan for the world weightlifting championship this year in 100 kilos or 110? Well, I don't know how much weight I will gain. If I gain weight, I will be 110 kilos.
SPEAKER_03: How much do you weigh now? 106-107 kg. I'll wait for Engin for a second.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah he he said that we will see right now he's 106 107 kg but uh he's he's gaining weight a little bit so he said if if i will gain like to 110 i will stay to 110 because he doesn't want to drop too much you know yeah yeah he said he said it doesn't really matter yeah yeah yeah i agree
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so let's talk about some predictions. And then then we can. Okay, one more question before that, Michael, you said that you show your bicep and then you said that stem cell is helping for sure. And in but right now you are not sure about it. Is it because on MRI, it doesn't show complete heal?
SPEAKER_00: uh or is it when you train you feel a little bit uh weaker okay so here's what it is uh i have i had a i had the stem cells four weeks later i had an ultrasound it showed complete reattachment i had a second dose of stem cells four weeks later had another ultrasound when i'm moving it everything's you know everything's intact you see the tendon move um it's just one of the guys that was watching the mri's like or the ultrasounds like
SPEAKER_00: know it's completely reattached i just don't know if the tensile strength of the tendon because it's baby stem cell you know it's stem cells right so it's new it's new growth is the tensile strength as strong as the previous tendon well hell that was not optimistic optimistic for me to hear you know i was like well i mean i just wanted to know that it's completely reattached now in training i had a lot of soreness right in the area
SPEAKER_00: is it because you haven't been training that out yet exactly exactly because it makes me think well is it the tendon or is it just the muscles around it because i haven't done anything for eight weeks you know yeah so i think the soreness is you know you haven't worked out in eight weeks and you you're pushing it and you feel sore and you feel tender well i got on the table with corey the other day which i wasn't gonna do and corey is very very strong right now and the fact that the integrity of my bicep held up
SPEAKER_00: riser held up i was like i got somewhat optimistic you know what i mean so it's uh a lot of it's just gonna be mental it's mental you know it's just like when my left arm blew apart
SPEAKER_00: It took me a while before I was willing to go back into that shoulder, you know what I mean? When Anderson Silva busted his leg kicking Chris Weidman, I'm probably sure it was a while before he threw another leg kick. It's just being confident that the bicep is going to hold up when I'm in a war against someone as strong as Anger Bayek, you know? I will tell you something. If you train with Corey, and even if it's training, we know how strong the guy's side pressure is and everything, you know?
SPEAKER_02: mean if it is not bothering you so much there and now you have near three more weeks and you know every day is healing more and more and more and i think that you have every reason to be uh confident about the bicep and i i don't think that either value will apply there as much as pressure either yellow needs to technically a little bit dominate you then then you can apply the pressure
SPEAKER_02: i don't think that the raw strength that corey applies i don't think that many uh people in the world has that that kind of pressure you know but just my opinion i 100 agree with that assessment as far as you're talking about raw power corey west possesses something he's one of the most powerful individuals i've ever met and i've been around this thing for a very long time strong kid yeah but what what what coin doesn't have
SPEAKER_02: uh uh peter galley has which is which is uh that the feather top roll better better pronation uh right that kind of like technically i think he is better than better than corey uh yeah like like john was able to catch corey inside somehow because of his pronator you understand and then but he was still explosive enough to go there i don't think it was possible to do that with uh but who knows
SPEAKER_03: right can i can i can i translate translate a bit yeah please yeah uh
SPEAKER_03: I don't even know how to say it in Russian. Stem cells. Well, these cells that made a new injection. Stem cells. I don't know how to say it in Russian. And yes, he says, everything is completely healed. The ultrasound shows that everything is whole and healed. He says, when I train,
SPEAKER_03: nothing, no discomfort, everything is fine. But he says, there is a little bit of worry, because it's all just fresh, it's not that strong yet. But so far, he kept it very well. And with Corey West, you know who Corey West is, his partner, he's big. They trained, and Corey is very strong. And he says that I kept him, and everything is fine.
SPEAKER_02: Let's start talking about some other match predictions and then we can finish it. Let's start with the countrymen of
SPEAKER_03: Alizhan Muradov and Oleg Petrenko with left arm, 105 kilos. He said, I hope for my country, man.
SPEAKER_02: oh yeah he doesn't predict but he just hopes yeah okay okay looks like we are not gonna hear a lot of things total of the things that uh today is gonna tell us probably will be uh ten full sentence but that's okay you know anyway so and michael do you know these guys uh
SPEAKER_02: What? Yeah, all I know is Petrenko looked ridiculously strong left-handed at the last one. So I don't know enough about the other Kazakhstan gentlemen, but Petrenko looked ridiculously impressive. Alijan Murado was around 210 pounds, and he competed the WAF super heavyweight. He chose to compete super heavyweight, and he beat everyone and won the world's super heavyweight while he was only 210 pounds. He used to be also...
SPEAKER_02: 176 pound board champion by dominating i will tell you about it i i i will tell you about this much about alijan before res res you know restaurant yes right you know right michael yeah before before he came to us the last tournament he competed was low teacher which alijan won that class comfortably and reg took like seven plays
SPEAKER_02: his category oh wow yeah yeah yeah it was then 171 pounds the guy probably will be near 220 for this event because it is 405 kilo world title anyway so yeah let's let's let's go with the another one probably these some of them they will not know but craig tuller versus samusha uh do you know who craig is or is
SPEAKER_02: Craig Tullier. Craig. Craig Tullier. No, he doesn't know. Okay, yeah, that's very hard. You know, many of the American guys don't know about some Eastern guys, as Michael didn't know about Ali Jean.
SPEAKER_00: and now he doesn't know about craig but but probably michael knows both samusha and craig because michael has been even in same event with uh yeah right so um that's the same guy that paul and just beat right yeah yeah um i think craig's got good chances uh as long as craig does an elbow foul i think he's got a good chance especially don't book me what is it 85 kg
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah i like craig's chances in that one i would say 65 35 craig but just just to remind you he was 187 when you pulled paul and paul was about 220. very impressive he's super strong yeah i don't know craig should be able to match him in horsepower um i would think
SPEAKER_00: But if he's not, Craig's very versatile. He's been around a long time. He's got a lot of experience. And he's just got no quit. You know, I mean, he lost his match to Brandon L. Seltzer, but that was a crazy, crazy match. Pablo was here. That match was insane. And that Pablo, I mean, he was, Craig was probably stripped 190. And after he rehydrated, Brandon was probably close to 220. You know what I mean? So it was definitely, although they both weighed in in that 200-pound weight cap,
SPEAKER_02: brandon rehydrated very well yeah yeah yeah brandon is normally naturally bigger guy for sure oh yes big boy yeah i mean he's got arms the size of me pablo he's big boy you know what i'm saying yeah yeah and and and craig uh didn't have a chance to use his cup because of the pronation of brandon well he will not have that samusha will be going inside so we don't really um i mean
SPEAKER_02: Craig will be able to give his everything in this match. Craig's got it. He's going to leave it on the table for sure. It's interesting. I like it. I like the match. Another Kazakh match for Kydrygal they would know. Does Kydrygal know who is Mindaugas Tarasaitis? Kydrygal, do you know Mindaugas Tarasaitis? Yes, he knows.
SPEAKER_03: And what does he think about him versus Nurdalet? Nurdalet is probably his teammate. He said Nurdalet became a world champion in this class and he said that probably he's going to win.
SPEAKER_02: going to win in things yeah okay yeah yeah you know whenever you complete tournaments you know the draw really affects you know sometimes you know these two didn't mean and mindag was
SPEAKER_02: Daniel Prokofiev had a long match before this one. So we don't know. They are going to meet and do a fresh match. We'll see how it will be. I'm not going to ask you. You don't know who Nurdale is for sure, Michael. I know who Nurdale is. He was very impressive. It's hard to compare when you don't know the other guy. Yeah, you're like, oh, let's go with the guy I know. You have no idea.
SPEAKER_00: real quick i got a question for pablo what are you weighing right now what's your weight are you cutting weight still yeah i'm 243 this morning okay okay so are you going to 220 or are you staying 240 40
SPEAKER_03: No, I'm going to 231 as of right now, and then I will decide because 220 is a little bit skinny side for me. I may drop for special event to 220, but I will not walk around at 220. It's a little too light for me. Rockers are going to have a 220 match. That's what Brent said. Is that accurate or is that something that's down?
SPEAKER_03: uh uh uh we don't know yet if if if i will push myself i can make it that fast but i don't know if i will because i don't want to lose my power you know at 220 i start losing my power of course of course i mean you're really strong right now are you uh is your next event illinois state illinois state yes yeah cool yeah that's what i got yeah yeah um okay let's go another one uh do you know who pauline is
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he knows. And Pauline versus Rustam Baber, but Rustam is coming there after a break with four months training. What does he think about this match?
SPEAKER_03: Paul Lynn will fight Rustam Babaev, but Rustam comes back after a break. He makes a comeback and has only been training for 4 months. What do you think, who will win? I know it will be good for me. He is strong. I think he will win. Do you think Rustam will win?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he said that Paul is a very strong dude and he's very good, but he thinks that Rustam has an edge on this. Okay, and now let's go to Michael. We will probably hear something opposite, Michael. Man, Paul Lynn's a bad dude. Up until his match with Pablo, you would have thought Paul Lynn was just on a terror, just killing people.
SPEAKER_00: And then Pablo put the brakes on him. Um, but Pablo showed up very, very strong on December 10th. So Rustam, if Rustam of old shows up, it's going to, you know, I think there's a chance if Rustam wins my opinion, he's going to need to beat Paul quickly. Now I know Rustam has crazy endurance and he's been in some of the longest matches ever.
SPEAKER_00: i think if he doesn't and i'm gonna tell you why if he doesn't beat paul in quickly he's gonna give paul in a lot of confidence and i think if you let paul become confident he's a very dangerous individual so if he believes he's because i think the biggest thing he's got is it's a legend he's pulling the best middleweight arm wrestler of all time right i mean the most accomplished eaf wf champion ever in that division
SPEAKER_00: So they're not that division, but you know, the middleweight division. So in my opinion, the biggest thing he's going to have is believing that he deserves to be in the match. Like, and if he stops and put the brakes on him, Ooh, I think you're going to see one bad-ass version of Paul. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, these are all incredible matches. I'm so excited because I have no clue because, I mean, I was expecting Gamtenadze. I told Gamtenadze, Gamtenadze said he is in best ever shape. And this guy has like big wins against big guys. And he said, even if Paul is 110 kilo, he said he was going to win. But Paul just dominated him. So Paul is surprisingly strong. But of course that he is not as experienced
SPEAKER_02: uh like as uh rooster yeah but let's see how there's not a lot of people as experienced as restaurant you know exactly all right yeah but it still doesn't change the fact that you know what it is you know the guy is very knowledgeable and very experienced and sometimes it makes the the difference it can change the result if the power is so close yeah anyway so uh gabriella versus barbara
SPEAKER_03: Gabriela and Barbora, do you know girls like that? Do you know Barbora? Yeah, I know her. Yeah, I know her. She's Brazilian. Brazilian Gabriela? Yeah, Gabriela. He said Gabriela will win. Brazilian. Okay, he said that Gabriela is going to win. Yes. Michael?
SPEAKER_00: I will never vote against Gabby. That chick is the most impressive female I've ever seen arm wrestle in my life. And, you know, that's including Irina Makova, it's including, you know, Ecklace, everybody. Gabby is the most impressive maybe arm wrestler I've ever seen. I mean, she's awesome. But this lady she's going against is basically my size.
SPEAKER_02: i don't know i have no idea what's gonna happen you know um 275 pounds and yeah so bigger than me six two six two i think yeah yeah okay so almost as tall as me and outweighs me by like 30 pounds michael when you see her like this then then you will realize how how big she is you know
SPEAKER_02: not only because of the size but you will see that she's like she's not big take some muscle you know like a heavyweight like like female version of uh le one maybe not now a year later she will be
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. Gabby is just such an impressive five foot to just unbelievable at how she how she can put down so much power on the table just is bewildering. It's amazing. She is such. And the thing is, she's such a disciplined athlete. And the fact that she's been doing this for so long, it's such a high level. I mean, the most accomplished arm wrestler in the FWF history ever, you know, male, female doesn't matter. No one's done more than what she's done. So it's very difficult to ever vote against her.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I agree, I agree. Somebody is asking if the cards are signed already. My friend, the cards are not even printed, you know, and the people who will sign the cards in different countries, I mean, how can they sign? Hey, on that note, thank you so much for my awesome card. Did you see I got it made into a poster? I didn't see it. You made a poster already? Yeah, I posted it.
SPEAKER_00: it's a two foot by three foot poster. I was like, dude, I've got, and I wanted to wait. I'm gonna be honest. I'm like, it would be so much cooler if I win and it says world champion. I said, but if I don't win, I feel like a dick printing it. So I'm gonna go and print it now, you know, just in case. It was too cool a thing not to print, you know? Anyway, so let's go another match. By percentage, I am asking, Michael, this interesting match.
SPEAKER_02: michael todd versus you see those what are you talking about 51 49 michael todd okay okay
SPEAKER_02: You can ask him too. He doesn't want to give prediction, but you can tell him that Michael predicted for himself. Tell him that he said 99% for himself. I know, I know. But hey, I have a power here, right?
SPEAKER_03: Engin asked Michael in percentage, who will win your match with Kedrgaly. Michael said 51% to me, that I will win, 49% to Kedrgaly. Now they ask you, what do you think? I don't know. In percentage? I don't know the percentage. It depends on who is stronger.
SPEAKER_02: that yeah we will not hear it he doesn't know the percentage but table will show right right i wasn't expecting the man of principle he's not gonna say anything i mean even if you don't have principle no no no no no no that is his principle i'm just playing that that hasn't been your principle it is his principle and he just like um doesn't want to change it yet
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, just don't misunderstand me. Yeah, I have it. And in pork chop versus Europe, Michael pork chop, probably didn't get it wouldn't know about him. But I will ask you drop versus pork chop. Man, listen, Devin Larratt knows how to make people look good. So I have no idea how good this kid is. Now. He did this beat Ryan Espy. So that's pretty good. But zero is, in my opinion, a shorter lever.
SPEAKER_00: And it's just, if they're both going inside, I think the shorter lever is going to have the advantage, in my opinion, you know? So I'm going with Zurab. But do you expect a tough match? Yeah. Portchop looks really strong. Like, he looks really strong. I just think he's going to end up getting turned up on his bicep, you know? I think the shorter lever of Zurab is going to turn his palm up, and he's going to be more in this position versus in this. I think if Portchop gets somewhere in this position, he might win, but I think he's going to be more here.
SPEAKER_03: Hmm. Okay. I don't know. I'm just talking. Probably, probably he wouldn't know about Porkchop. His name is Curtis Cameron.
SPEAKER_03: He knows both guys, but he said the chances are pretty equal, like 50-50.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i agree i also feel the same way me too me too yeah it's it's very stylistically matters if uh if uh because of the livers if uh pork chop will be able to keep uh zura prevent zura from uh sinking inside too deep in a hook then pork chop have better chances in my opinion uh in a deep hook zura having better chances
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think porkchop needs to start very quick and catch Zurob somewhere here. If it is deep poke at the middle, still he can win, but I don't think Zurob is going to give up so quickly. Yeah, no, yeah. Anyway, so another one. I have the opinion of Michael, so let me start with Sidergale. Corey West versus Ferit Osmanlı, left arm.
SPEAKER_03: yeah and and michael
SPEAKER_00: i think it is a good test for corey um if reed is anywhere near like he used to be uh he's he's a bad dude right and i saw his weights like 300 pounds i don't never remember seeing him 300 pounds i don't think he's as put together as he was back in like 06 when he pulled john and devon and stuff um but i gotta go with corey i mean corey is until proven otherwise
SPEAKER_00: in my opinion, Corey is a threat for pretty much anyone left-handed. I mean, and his right, thing is, his right's really good. We talk about John, what John was able to do to him here, and that was very impressive, very impressive. But Corey's shoulder was messed up from pulling Alex three weeks before. My opinion, the Corey that exists today, right-handed, John does not want any of that dude. I understand. Okay. And, and, and, uh,
SPEAKER_03: This one, Corey West versus Arif Ertem, Kedirgali. Kedirgali, Arif and Corey West. Right, of course, right. Right. Right hand, right? Right. Arif and Corey West, right? I don't know, I hope Arif Ertem.
SPEAKER_03: He said he doesn't know for sure because both are very good, but he's rooting for Arif. He's what? He's rooting for Arif? Yeah. Okay. He hopes that Arif will win. Okay. And Michael? I think Arif's got the... Question, Michael. Is this tougher or easier match for Corey? Than the left arm?
SPEAKER_02: i mean i mean left arm with ferret and the right arm with arif which one is tougher
SPEAKER_00: Free is just, he's unknown left-handed. We haven't seen him do anything in a while. But the people who've been around know how good he is. So I think they're equally as difficult. Arif has a great top role. He does very well against inside arm wrestlers, right? People who want to go inside. It just takes a very, very good top roller to compromise Corey's right wrist. And I feel like if Arif does not get his wrist compromised, he is in a world of trouble.
SPEAKER_02: It's just Corey's very, very strong once he gets turned in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, Adam's side pressure is very strong. Usually he's having trouble with guys that are extremely good outside pulling, you know. But when he has his hit, he is able to hit. He's hitting very, very hard. Maybe you remember what some of the rounds, you know, Adam's arm went here and then from here and top row and beat him. But, you know, he's started.
SPEAKER_02: So, Pastor, I don't know if Corey, I mean, I know Corey doesn't have the pronation outside pull as Hermes, but he has incredibly strong reach and side pressure, as John also said. Go ahead. Stylistically, Reef, it's a very good potential win for him, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: um because corey has a lot of hype behind him so if he's able to beat corey that in my opinion just solidifies him even though obviously he's a wf world champ he took second to georgie this year whatever um or last year it's stylistically a good match because it is someone who he his style is someone he fares well against i just don't know if he's arm wrestling someone as strong as corey's in that in that spot you know what i mean like the spot that he's good at beating people in
SPEAKER_02: don't know if he's armed us with someone who's going to put up the same amount of resistance that corey does in that same way that's just what i think i i think the match will be between corey's wrist and side pressure and ariv's pronated side pressure this way i agree yeah yeah and another match kidney versus
SPEAKER_02: can you ask him in which way he thinks that gennady is going to win that match in style
SPEAKER_03: What style do you think Gennady will win this match in? Top. Top. He will go outside and be okay. And how do you see that match, Michael?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I agree that if he's going to beat him, he's going to beat him outside. I think if he goes inside with Freed, Freed's very, very strong inside. But I'm going to just tell you this. If Freed beats Gennady, how strong is Czar? Because Czar just went through Freed badly. You know what I mean? So if Freed beats Gennady, how strong is Czar? Yeah, but I will tell you something. I talked with Ferit, that is like my brother.
SPEAKER_02: and I made a video chat with him. I wanted to say good luck. He was in the airport and spending the night in the airport sitting together with Gachevsky. And because the flights are so problematic to Russia because of everything that's happening. So they probably, as far as I know, they couldn't sleep two days in a row. They didn't really rest. And then
SPEAKER_02: they arrived there in the morning and then they just pulled that they, you know, this is what I was told, you know, and I really, because also beat the first place guy from the, they went in 85 kilo in Dubai and here they pull the fresh match. The guy just flashed. I mean, I'm not saying he couldn't flash, but there is a, there is for sure that these guys didn't rest well, you know? And so what I'm hearing is,
SPEAKER_00: I'm still in the top 15 in the rankings because the guy that beat Fareed shouldn't have count, right? So I'm still in the top 15. Is that what I hear? Because I'm telling you, Free got knocked down and the guy, the other guy other than Czar that beat him moved up and knocked me off the rankings. So from your understanding, from what I'm hearing is I'm still top 15. See how I made that about me? I brought it all the way back around to me.
SPEAKER_02: You know, there are many guys that you are big trouble to them in top 10, you know. Yeah, I'm just messing with you, dude. I'm just playing. If anyone is saying that you can't beat anyone from top 15, they don't know what they are talking about, especially if you are heavy enough.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, if, for example, is Prudnik in top 15? I don't know. Yeah, he's on that ranking. He's on that ranking. I think he might be. Imagine you being heavyweight, super heavyweight, and then pulling Prudnik. I mean, in the same way, I see Prudnik having a chance to beat you. But you being super heavyweight and Prudnik being light, I mean, I don't see that. But whatever, you know, I'm not going to go there. So let's go another one.
SPEAKER_02: and chance versus arabuli uh probably you don't know arabuli my friend neither neither and then ahmed versus robert uh baxter i know both guys you know robert but you don't know how much right yeah i know that there's history at the world championships there's history between the two guys and that's why yeah yeah yeah near before robert won the gold
SPEAKER_02: and ahmed was second or something and then this year ahmed is the first and the robert was second so i i'm expecting a good one yeah and and you know uh douglas erich yeah yeah yeah versus raymond's near pins man coach ray continues to impress me i mean raymond's impresses me
SPEAKER_00: Doug, if Doug is the same form that Doug has showed up to some events in the past, I say he's a slight favorite, you know? But as far as experience, recent activity, you know, you got to give the edge to Ray in the fact that he's been constantly competing. He's done very, very well. But you can't count Doug out. I think it's at worst a 50-50 match, and I don't like Doug's chances. I understand. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Geri Kadaret versus Georgy Tsvetkov. Georgy Tsvetkov and Geri Kadaret, you got it. Who?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know, they're talking between them because I don't speak Kazakh. Jerry is going to be like this, as you showed, or he's going to be like this?
SPEAKER_03: Okay, he thinks inside the triceps, not the flops. If Georgi wanted to go outside,
SPEAKER_02: I'm in fresh round, he would take Jerry's wrist. There is no doubt in my mind. But Jerry, it doesn't really matter. I mean, the guy even likes it. You know, he's just like, please take my wrist, you know. As long as I put my shoulder behind. And Michael, how do you see that? Well, if you fall into the trap of taking his wrist, there's a way to beat Jerry efficiently.
SPEAKER_00: Just very few people possess the strength to do it. And if you get caught in the match that he wants to put you in, you're in for one hell of a fight. So in my opinion, if the match goes the way classic Jerry cataract matches go, then you got to pick Jerry. I mean, he's like you're training for a little bit more like side pressure with the bottom two finger and lower wrist. Oh, that's a way to beat him if he can do that.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, everyone can pull that way, but how strong are you? That's what I'm saying. If you can put him past his shoulder, if you can put Jerry past his shoulder before he connects, I mean, you can get rid of Jerry pretty easy. It's just once he gets that shoulder commitment, it's a very weird pressure that he applies on your arm. It's very difficult because, I mean, we all know once you have the hand, you transition behind it. It's very hard to transition behind it once he's in there. You know what I mean?
SPEAKER_00: like it's it's a very weird feeling yeah yeah yeah and were you surprised when he beat gennady man y'all did do great on reffing that match i love you guys but that that match had a lot of elbow fouls so yeah yeah i don't know how it goes we made it that's bigger i would love to see that i'd love to see that match again i'd love to see that match again with the bigger bigger elbow pads
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if Jerry beats Gennady again. Probably not. Yeah, probably not. I don't think so. Now, Jerry is ringing you. Oh, yeah. Yeah, exactly, exactly. Of course, Jerry can't beat me either. So, right? I mean, gosh, you know. Maybe he is thinking the same way you did. You said just you don't think that he can beat Gennady again.
SPEAKER_00: maybe jerry is going to call you and he's going to say i don't think you're going to beat me again oh yeah he says that all the time nobody can trust we can't trust what jerry says um but yeah so i i think jerry's gonna win that match unless georgie finds has enough strength to just put him out of pushing past his shoulder right off the start if he doesn't do that he's gonna be it's not gonna be it's not gonna be a good day uh-huh and and okay let's let's go to very important match
SPEAKER_02: All of them are important, but it's the match of God. John Brzenk vs Irakli Zerakashvili. Okay, what do you think, Kedrgaly? Kedrgaly, what do you think, Irakli Zerakashvili vs John Brzenk? I'll tell him that as of now Irakli is walking around 110 kilos. Irakli now weighs about 110 kilos. What do you think, who will win?
SPEAKER_04: He said that I don't know exactly how stylistically it's going to be.
SPEAKER_03: Irakli himself, but he said that he thinks that John will still win. Can you ask him, when he pulled against John, what was the difference between round one and the rest of the rounds? Kedar Ghali asks you, what was the difference between the first round when John won and the rest of the rounds when you won?
SPEAKER_04: What has changed? Technically, did he do something different, or John guessed out? Did you technically change something, or was John just tired? I didn't fight with John before, and I didn't know how he fought. I don't know how it will be.
SPEAKER_04: Well, he attacked me first. I couldn't wait for him. So I attacked him first. That's how it happened.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, he said that there was a difference. He never pulled Jan before, so he did not know exactly what to expect. So the first round, Jan was a little bit faster on a start and a go, and he gained a position and won. And then Kedrugali was faster, and he started to attack first, and that's what makes all the changes. Okay, so it's the second round, and the rest of the rounds,
SPEAKER_00: He attacked the right point of the goal. Faster, faster. Yeah, okay, okay. I understand. And Michael? It's hard to vote against John. I think Iraqli presents the same threat that Angerbaev did in that, you know, Tarsi Bakken style back pressure attack on John's hand. And if John's shoulder isn't
SPEAKER_00: a hundred percent healthy. I'm not sure he fights back from that position. You know, if he gets cracked open, if John's wrist is strong enough to contain him, I think John all day, I think Iraq, we bust his hand back like he did against Todd Hutchings. I think Iraq, we probably beats John. Cause I don't think John can apply the same amount of pressure unless the stem cells that build his shoulder. Yeah. Unless, unless his shoulders completely recovered back to what it was, you know,
SPEAKER_00: 10, 20 years ago, I don't think John has the faith in his joint in his shoulder to apply that kind of pressure anymore. I don't know. We'll see. But I mean, it's hard to bet against John. So you got to bet on John. Yeah, I understand. And if we quickly also talked about what's going on lately about Levan and Hermes and Zaur and, you know, Denis Sheplenko, like,
SPEAKER_00: what do you think about all this michael i haven't really been following everything i did see the training with czar and dennis and i could did i saw czar beat dimitri and three and those guys at the antsy thing um i've heard there's been some back and forth
SPEAKER_00: challenges or whatever some smack talking i i want to see armies in in lebanon because that's a match we've been looking forward to uh i'd like to seize our pull somebody in the top 10 that's not out of outside of russia to see if he's as dominant as he looks like he is over there and if he is he should get the winner of armies and lebanon in my opinion you know um the the guy's strong he's a strong young man um i don't know how do you see admission uh level one
SPEAKER_02: just like army says he's if he cracks his wrist he puts him in trouble if he's not able to get that risk to go back yeah we know that you know about what's the possibility in your opinion this this this thing's to happen what's our biggest win right now i give you five thousand dollars but that is only for you to bet normally i don't bet i'm a muslim you know i don't bet but
SPEAKER_02: If you have $5,000, somebody gave you. Okay, I don't give you. But you're going to use this money only for betting. I bet on LeBron. I bet on LeBron. Yeah, with how much doubt in your mind? Not much? Well, I mean, someone gave me the money, so I have no risk. You know what I'm saying? I have a question. When LeBron beat Dave Sheffield, many people said that they wish that the match went to strap.
SPEAKER_02: And but Hermes beat Dave Chaffee directly in strap and from right from the first round. So how do you like, do you think that it is any anything like that shows that if Hermes gets a little bit stronger, you know, there is a possibility when Levan is going, Hermes to just somehow stop him? Yeah, it's definitely possible.
SPEAKER_00: odds are levon's too strong but in my opinion this is what i've said from day one to beat levon you're gonna have to go through probably the strongest hand that's ever existed in arm wrestling but that's the path you can't go toward him you have to come i mean yes he used to be he used to get beat in shoulder presses he used to get caught on his bicep i think those days are long gone i think to beat levon you have to beat his hand
SPEAKER_00: and army says one of the best top roles out there and the thing is he's gonna have to live or die on that outside top role movies that have to commit to it like he's never committed you know if he gets a slip which is a big if if he gets a slip and gets the strap he's gonna have to risk getting his bicep torn you know he's gonna he's gonna have to risk it and if you're willing to risk it and you can if the strength is close
SPEAKER_02: i think i think armies is going to have the better endurance i think armies is going to have uh what it takes but those are big yes you know yeah when when i saw 115 kilos devon uh when he jumped on uh with the shoulder pressure on prudnik's bicep prudnik has very strong hook with how effective he was whenever he tried to do the same thing against levan
SPEAKER_02: And then I realized that I don't think that anybody can really hook
SPEAKER_00: And I don't think so. I mean, you know, you hear John John Brzee like, I think I'd grab him low like you used to do, Cleve Dean. I'm like, listen, this is a different animal. This is not a guy you grab low. You know what I'm saying? You have to beat this man's hand. And if you can't beat his hand, and that's what makes it such a difficult task because he probably possesses the strongest hand arm wrestling has ever seen. Right. Yeah. I mean, not only that, but his grenade and everything is just different. The level of the super heavyweight today.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not talking about light and middle ways. In the past, there was very, very good guys that could give him in today. Just say 2007, I don't see anyone in 165, be it in him, you know, not at all, not even close.
SPEAKER_02: But what I'm just trying to say that when Jonet, the Golden Bear, 98, first time when he tried against Alan Karayev, he hold him low and he wanted to go and he got, you know, flashed by Alan. And then in the final, even he was more tired, he came from B side, he still was able to top roll him. But whenever he low grip and the low grip beating doesn't always like work as it worked against like Khalif Dean, you know, so. Yeah, I mean.
SPEAKER_00: And I was talking about this today, is what has happened with technology and access to information. What used to take someone a decade to learn, a person can learn in 12 to 18 months now. If they're committed in their training and they're training the right moves, you're not wasting energy on things that don't make you a better arm wrestler. You're focusing on the things that make you a better arm wrestler. It's just a different evolution of the sport, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: Uh, with, with the combination of super heavyweights being massively huge individuals, um, consistent gym training and gym exercise focused on arm wrestling has made the super heavyweight division. Something that's never been before. Yeah. Yeah. Michael, in the past, you know, there was not this many old super heavyweight competition.
SPEAKER_02: right now it's like how many times a year a superweight american was able to meet a superweight from there i'm talking about very early there was not even really so many european eastern european superweights if you are talking about like 30 90 like 80s or something you know so now look look at the competition that all these big guys and that i always believe one thing it is the level of the competition
SPEAKER_02: that makes people better and better and better and better without that that is why americans super heavyweights because there is more money in super heavyweights there is more attention so american super heavyweights were
SPEAKER_02: have been invited to this side of the world and still had that the part of the but the american lightweights they always stayed there they didn't come here and they were not specially invited they were not like really but now they are also coming so i think but while the european lightweights every year european championship or championships
SPEAKER_02: all those guys were competing against each other they compete learn go back they train different they come back better so that's that is because now the super heavyweight has this competition and now the things are out of control you know and they're the big big competition and and how do you see the the super heavyweight how do you see for example the zaur haizulev ermes
SPEAKER_03: Jerry and Lewand. How do you see this? What would be his top five ranking right now? Can you ask him? Qadaraglion asks you, how do you see who is in which position, more or less, if we take, for example, the super heavy Zaur Pazilaev, Lewand Seginashvili, Jerry Kaderet,
SPEAKER_03: and ermes gasparini who who who where is the first second third fourth i can leave levan levan number one okay
SPEAKER_04: The one who is stronger. I don't know how to describe him. He is also a good lifter. I don't know how to describe him, but he is the best.
SPEAKER_03: uh-huh okay uh yeah he said that yeah you named it and levan is number one uh those three are very good sportsmen he said i'm not sure about zaur because we did not see him on uh open international arena you just saw him closed in russia so he said you know i don't exactly know where he is but uh yeah jerry and gasparini are who knows approximately the same they're good at least
SPEAKER_02: What do you think, do Gasparini and Levan have any chances or do they have no chances at all?
SPEAKER_03: okay okay yeah he said he said i'm not sure about uh who brings what form but he said that it's he have to be ready and there is it makes sense uh to get time for your preparation in that sense that yes he has a chance if he will be prepared right he has a chance
SPEAKER_02: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Probably he's the one that deserves after his win against Dave Chaffee. Right from the round one, you know, I think that Hermes is the one that will deserve it. And what's your top five before we finish, Michael?
SPEAKER_00: LeBron, who knows? You know what I'm saying? Like, I can't put Jerry ahead of Dave Chafee. I can't. He's never beating me. You know what I'm saying? Like, I can't put Jerry ahead of Dave. So that just throws everything off. You cannot beat Dave and then Jerry beats, I mean, like. That's what I'm saying. Everything, I can never put Jerry Catarat above Dave Chafee. I can't.
SPEAKER_02: Until he beats him, I can't put him ahead of me. Even if Jerry now beats, just say, the guys that beat Dave. Like, if Jerry beats, just say Morozov and Hermes. These guys, he already beat Genna. These guys are the ones that beat Dave. Just, I mean, does he need to beat Dave to rank above Dave? I understand what you're saying. And if he did beat someone, Morozov or Hermes,
SPEAKER_00: who just beat Dave. Armie's more so, in my opinion, than I would guess I would rank him higher than Dave. But I can't rank him higher on the Gennady match. There just was so many elbow fouls. You know what I mean? Like, I can't... Although he has the world title from it, it's just watching the match for me, like I said, I don't think he beats Gennady again. I don't think they run that match back on... Do you think that Dave was the only one that elbow fouled?
SPEAKER_00: no absolutely not absolutely not but i'm just saying it's not an accurate depiction of the match in my opinion because of there's so much that went on that would have stopped the match right like regardless of who had which foul or who fouled first or whatever letting the match it was awesome entertainment the match itself entertaining was very entertaining it's just like yeah
SPEAKER_00: Well, we're not going to call it that. You know what I'm saying? I mean, it is what it is. I mean, that's the nature of the beast right now. You as a pure star wrestler, you want everything to be as rigid as possible. But the spectators don't want to see that. So we're caught in this. Yeah, so you are saying that even in that circumstance, like, do you think that Javid didn't prove that he was at least as good as Gennady? No, he's as good as Gennady. He's as good. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Dave Chafee was as good as Gennady the first two rounds. You know what I'm saying? No, no, no. First two rounds is a different thing. You need to win the whole match. You know, it doesn't work that way. No, I understand that. I understand what you're saying. I'm just saying. I mean, according to this, you beat Pushkar or something, you know, in the last time you met him. No, he beat me the first two rounds.
SPEAKER_02: oh okay he beat you first so that then you beat him then i beat him too and then beat me too yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah if he didn't figure out that the the dead is shoulder pressure no he wouldn't if he would have went to that nevers press and they weren't you know and that that was rich those are strict rules he got the elbow foul saved him
SPEAKER_02: the him purposely fouling saved him you know what i mean to get the restart so i had to catch his hitting and that's part of the strategy that was the rule you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he was afraid to try this because of his experience from from before that he tried that one he didn't work but at that point he had
SPEAKER_02: he had no chance no other chance opportunity than this one he tried and then and it worked yeah i mean and here's the thing i was so stupid i should have just caught the up as soon as he went for it i should have just elbow fell off and got a restart but i i never think about purposely fouling i never think about it but i think that once once he put that shoulder
SPEAKER_00: i i think after that point even you get a foul or something he was naturally bringing you here anyways but he just couldn't appear i mean it might have worked i mean i'm just saying i i didn't give myself every possible opportunity to win because i didn't take the intentional foul you know and that's that's part of strategy for arm wrestling i've always just been i want to win
SPEAKER_00: And I'm always fighting until the very end, and I forget about fouling. I'm like, oh, shit, I should have fouled. And then now with arm wars and WAL, fouls didn't save you. Fouls, you just had to win the match still. So getting a foul now never really helped me.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I don't know. I like East versus West. I like what you're doing. The bigger elbow pads, that's cool. I've never arm wrestled on those. I mean, I've had the 7x9s, which is so funny because people are like, oh, you're only good at WAL. I'm like, well, the only time I've ever been pinned by Jerry Cadarette this decade was WAL. He never pinned me in UAL on 7x7 pads, right? And then they want to say, well, you showed us below the table. I'm like, well, that wasn't a foul, Ben.
SPEAKER_00: It's like you're trying to put today's rules on matches that didn't have those rules. You know what I mean? The foul of the Kings move has changed. So the wins that I had previously were under those rules. Those were legit wins. The rules are different now. I don't know, man. I'm excited about our wrestling. I'm excited about pulling this young man right here. I'm going to do the best I possibly can. You have five-something back at the WL.
SPEAKER_02: here you have one fountain yeah from the back yeah but you also have the front see the people forget that i have that really front front yes but but for you the part that you care is that the one that's from the website my press allows me to come forward uh yeah yeah yeah i mean i mean if you do the timing wrong i mean sorry if you did the timing right
SPEAKER_02: it doesn't really matter once you get on the the tired bicep of your opponent the the one something on something you usually finish it and always you know yeah right right yeah i mean i'm excited who knows man i mean listen listen michael i i like you very much i respect you very much but when you come here we really need to uh in a transparent way we need to really talk about this so that he and i we will not i i argue about it even even in the devon larat match
SPEAKER_02: they gave that foul with a late very late yeah they were not even given i called the turkish reference i said why are you not giving and then then he gave and i was like i thought i just sit down with devon and we watch and
SPEAKER_02: and i said this he said you are totally writing it should have been called long before and this is exactly devon said he should have david just wanted to put the fleet on him he just wanted to fatigue he just wanted to fatigue prudently i don't understand we talk right before right before the event very clearly this is okay once this this is not okay this okay this is not okay
SPEAKER_02: This match, it wasn't even like this. Anyway, so it is not about Devon or something. I just want the rules to be applied. People also blames me when Rudnick on round one, if it was pin or not. But I also talk at the referee's meeting. I said, even if it is one something about the bet, any slip is strapped. We told. I didn't know who's going to do that. If it is going to be Rudnick, if it's going to Devon or another match. We said, any slip?
SPEAKER_02: is that the strap but even from the camera and down we are we couldn't see that because referee's head or something that he was on the way we didn't see it and i don't know if it was pin or not but it was very close even if he would give pin nobody would argue but he said he wasn't pinned so we couldn't you know okay so on that note are there gonna be fouls in a referee's grip
SPEAKER_02: Because there were no fouls in the referee's grip in Devin versus Prudnik. They're going to be fouls. Because I heard, I wasn't there. I was told that you told them not to foul him in a referee's grip. Because there's no point in a referee's grip if there's no fouls. No, no, no, no, no, no. We didn't say like that. I'm just saying that's what I was told. Well, we said, because of the small moments, don't foul out people. Just tell them to not do. If you see that they don't listen to you, they take advantage of your good intentions, then foul him.
SPEAKER_02: This is exactly what I said. But there, I didn't see really application. I'm not talking about this specific match, but I want the match to start at the center, right here, the center. I don't want here, and I don't want anyone to also come up and do this either. But it needs to be from both sides. And I don't want to give you more, but maybe we just give warning at the referee's grip.
SPEAKER_02: and then another warning and a foul so that the guy will have more chances to you know yeah a mask as long as i know what the rules are going into the match i'm fine yeah so what about shoulder across the center of the table ah yeah there should be a foul yeah yeah okay yeah yeah cool all right good yeah anyways anyways yeah i'm cool hey i'm good man i'm excited i'm excited
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah yeah anyways everything will be fine and then i i want listen i always say the athlete from east or west or japan or the africa or canada or america or georgia kazakhstan it doesn't matter we all are brothers and sisters in our wrestling and i want the rule to be applied like i want i want to even ref go up there to ref but i have thin skin i will get crazy if like
SPEAKER_02: you understand so i just try to stay away yeah yeah yeah and but i i would rep very good trust me because i i know arm wrestling and i i can feel bad intention i can feel who is doing what you know everything and i have dominant personality and i i run this event and i don't want people to talk bad about this event so i would just make sure that the athletes would listen to me and just do
SPEAKER_02: like and compete according to the rules and everything anyways so anyways yeah hey yeah thank you thank you thanks for having me thank you for joining and yes and and thank you everybody thank you thank you guys y'all be good paulo paulo thank you very much my friend for no problem no problem no problem yeah
