Is it possible to take a screenshot and... Okay, let me try to do. One second, guys. One second. Do you see me now or no? Yes, I see you. Yes, of course. Okay, one second. What if I...
SPEAKER_01: need to um one second because i think jerry also has the same problem i think you can hear me yeah yeah yeah you came yeah i figured it out okay okay that's good that's good that's good yeah i was trying to send you yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Jerry, Jerry, be careful when you come in, huh? Be careful. Huh? You'll be careful, you know, just maybe first start with closing your eyes and then slowly just make yourself get ready, you know, for what you will see. Ah, see?
SPEAKER_01: The trophy's big. Oh, trophy is big, yeah? You're right. Yeah, that's what I wanted to show you. At least something. Yeah. Hi, Jerry. How are you, my man? I'm good. How are you? I can't complain. You can complain, but no one's going to listen. Yeah. Can you show your forearm in this angle? Sideway.
SPEAKER_01: Shaw it the other way, like this way. How? Because the way it's going to end up. Is he saying the truth, Georgi? What?
SPEAKER_02: Is he saying the truth that your arm is going to end up here? No, no, no. His arm will do this. His arm will go that way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. First the wrist and after that, side pressure. Oh, yeah. It's always good to have dreams. This is not a dream, this is the reality.
SPEAKER_01: Many claim that. Very few can do it, if any. OK, we will see. In one month, we will see. This is true. Yeah. I thought that I fixed it. It's not gallery mode anymore? I see that. But still, people write gallery mode, gallery mode. OK. Anyway, so.
SPEAKER_01: So Jerry, is this guy a threat for you? I know you're going to say you don't underestimate, but just tell us what is in your heart. He's a top roller, pure top roller. And people, I don't know, what do you think?
SPEAKER_00: I think, uh, everyone's gotta be a threat. If you, if you underestimate anyone, you could run a risk of losing. Right. So he obviously proved himself, won the WAF, but, uh, I, uh, I'm never gonna concede to anyone. Right. So I would like to say that it's, it's, it should be a good match. I just, um, I feel as though I will win, you know what I mean?
SPEAKER_01: you just can't imagine him beating you right right yeah and if he tries to beat you his elbow will be out from the back side yeah he's obviously got a big arm right so that's a lot of elbow to push off the back of the path um i think uh
SPEAKER_00: If he's going to go in a top role, you know, he's a big boy. So I think he's going to run out of real estate. So he will not have room to go far enough. Right. That's in my opinion, right? Yeah, of course. But your opinion matters the most right now. Because you are the one who's going to pull him.
SPEAKER_00: Right. I expect that he's obviously strong and he's good. I just, I think that I'll be better. But stylistically, you find him well for your style. I think it's a good matchup for me. Yeah, yeah. And you, Yorgi, do you agree with him?
SPEAKER_02: I agree that my style is weak against his style because he is very powerful and he doesn't fight for his wrist. But now I will try to improve my technique in the hook and side pressure and I will do my best to win.
SPEAKER_02: it will be completely different game completely different style for this match i will do completely different trainings preparation will be and you already started right already two weeks three weeks you are starting yes yes i already started with social motion crossy i train only hook and side question and and do you see improvement in that way
SPEAKER_02: Yes, of course. I see a lot of improvements. My strength is bigger, much bigger inside than before. And I think that in one month, I will develop very fast this ability to fight in hook and side pressure. I think that I will do a very nice job. And then you will get through, through Jerry, like boom.
SPEAKER_02: no no i think that this match will be a real war very difficult match for both of us one match but i think that i will win i usually usually when the war is longer if the match is long usually jerry is winning those matches usually yes this time will be different
SPEAKER_02: I know that he is very strong, but my endurance will be on another level. I train every day, sometimes two times a day, and my endurance will be on the top level. Do you plan to be patient?
SPEAKER_01: Because when you are not passionate, you say that this is going to be a good match. It means that the match will stop somewhere because you say it's not going to be easy for neither of you. So it means that the match is going to stop somewhere. But we know that you sometimes may have the elbow problem from the backside of the pad. Yeah. Sometimes Jerry also has the from the front side. The pads are now like
SPEAKER_01: eight inches from every side. It's now 18, 18, but it's now 22 and something. So do you, are you afraid that, you know, you may make a mistake and foul out while hurrying up or you think that you're going to be patient and let your endurance do the job?
SPEAKER_02: I think that the bigger pads now are better for me because I will have more room for my elbow. And I think that I will try not to be so slowly. I will attack fast, you know, to stop me in this position, not here or here. I will be faster. I mean, you can catch him here on the bicep.
SPEAKER_01: my opinion and with the wrist like this my opinion you're going to win that match but the problem is to take him to that position i will be very fast on the start and i will go side pressure not top row i try to make this technique to improve this ability
SPEAKER_01: I understand. To make this, not this. Okay, okay, okay. But, yeah, okay. But remember, you have only one centime extra from back, but Jerry also has one centime from the front. You know, right? Yes, yes. Okay, okay. And Jerry, you have anything to say about this, all this? No, I was just going to ask the question. You added the inch in the front and in the back? I mean, after you versus Genadi match,
SPEAKER_01: You know, we wanted to allow the little go out in, you know, and then right after that match, I made it eight inches, eight inches. Normally it's 18 something, 18 something from everywhere. But now not from one side, not like, you know, while did it from the backside only. This is one something from one something is a little bit less than a half inch, a little bit less than. So one something from front, one something from back, one something from this side,
SPEAKER_01: and one something from this side, equally, we made it bigger, one something only from. But this time, even the elbow gets a little bit out, like a little bit like this, it's a foul. We made it one something bigger from everywhere. If you still cannot keep your elbow, no complaining. Referee will say, stop, foul. Now you have, nobody has any excuse. Keep your elbow on the pad, you know. But this is same for everyone, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Is it any part of the elbow off the pad, or is it the bulk of the elbow off the pad? What's that? Is it any part of the elbow, or is it the most of the elbow? I mean, yeah. I mean, this is now, see, I will show you now. Now this is okay. I don't know how I can show, but now this is not okay. Okay. This is now out. In, out. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So I would suggest both of you to be patient because he's pressing not forward, but like forward and side while you're going a little bit back. Even you want to go side pressure, your elbow will automatically a little bit move this way because you are pulling, yeah. So yeah, that's what I wanted to say, yeah. Engin, did he say he just wants to start right in the hook? Oh, that is Genadi said it.
SPEAKER_01: And then he regrets it as far as I remember, yeah. If I beat you 3-0, the last game I will go inside hook. If you are winning 2-0, last round hook. Yes, directly hook. Yeah, but if you are winning 2-0 after two easy matches, even after a war, because after a war, you just go once in.
SPEAKER_01: then you lose the next three rounds, trust me. So you be careful about what you are saying, you know. I will not risk that. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. I wouldn't go. Going side pressure with Jerry can make sense if you don't lose your Ronaldo at the same time. But when you are going sideways, you be careful that he doesn't bend his wrist at the same time, you know. And then you remember.
SPEAKER_01: When Genadi try to go like this and then press him to the table surface, you know, so it's... Yes, but I think that my pronator is stronger than Genadi. No, no, what I'm just saying that if you don't use the pronator, it doesn't matter how strong you are. If you just too much spinate, he will get you in, you know. So your pronator is strong as long as you use it actively, you know.
SPEAKER_01: understand like you i mean you may have super strong tornado but if you're super need how is it going to help you know to take the guys if you don't move that way you understand this what i said and jerry jerry is just waiting waiting waiting not no comments about what he's thinking about all this just have it just make sure you have a game plan but my game plan is really is
SPEAKER_00: i'm just so strong i'm stronger what i'm stronger what what what part are you stronger at you will see this will be my secret if if you're stronger then you could just start right inside like a real strong
SPEAKER_01: if you are so strong why don't you try to pro with me maybe try one game after i win the first three i'll do it okay okay see bojita bojita is saying that ten thousand dollar for jerry if he can topple setco in first two rounds
SPEAKER_01: but jerry jerry may say the same thing you know ten thousand dollars to georgie if he hooks me and beats me in hook first two rounds you know yeah absolutely yeah yeah so that's that's that's interesting you know um georgie i mean like why you have disadvantage georgie um in your life
SPEAKER_01: Just say at this, I mean, like Georgi, if I tell you who is the, I say this many times, I will repeat again, who is the best top roller in the history? Then you will have a name. I asked this 200 people, 10 people will say this guy, 20 people will say this guy. But if I sell you who is the, in the history, the best dead wrist shoulder pressure guy, what would be the answer?
SPEAKER_01: 98 percent they would say jerry cutters right yes two percent probably don't know much about armors that's my opinion so what i'm just saying that jerry has pulled all his life against top rollers i'm not trying to create negativity but that's your disadvantage this guy pulled against all kind of topple types all kind of yeah you and other people top rollers
SPEAKER_01: didn't really meet someone with that, that risk pressure at this level. So that is why you need to do homework very well. Because this guy doesn't need to do homework. He even can write the book of the like, how to be top rollers with the dead is all kind of young. So he's that experience knowledgeable, while you are gonna face something like
SPEAKER_01: difference different not so before yeah i agree with that yeah yeah yeah yeah so jay will be very difficult opponent for me i know that but i will do my best yeah like a beast every day yeah yeah yeah that the reason i'm saying this to you just to be careful and take it more and more seriously you know
SPEAKER_01: because i mean your classic way is not going to end up your classic will end up this way like this yes and your brachioradialis will eventually get tired tired tired yeah um if jenny was a top roller then then i would be more telling him what to do you know because it's hard to talk yeah yeah yeah i know i know yeah yeah but i will do my homework yeah
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah usually jerry comes here with with some kind of tank top but even he does he doesn't put tank top he also looks good look at those shoulders huh yeah i don't know gotta be careful how many kilograms are you now what is your weight my weight uh 320 328 how about you 328
SPEAKER_01: 328 oh 328 yeah 328 yeah which is you are 149 kilo is it what's one 150 is what 30 yes so 140. 330 is 150. yeah yeah okay so almost almost 150. yeah yeah 149 and he is 165 kilo he said see big boy
SPEAKER_01: What's that? I say that I'm heavier than you with 15 kilograms. Yeah. How tall? I'm 190 centimeters. How does that relate to? 190 is about 6'2". Oh, okay. No, 6'3". 6'2", maybe 6'2 1⁄2", or something like that. Okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: How about you? How about you? Just below 6'2", so I think that is probably 188, Engin? Yeah, I think both are very similar. You know, Georgi, on January 21st, that is a date for you that, like, I know you are already a world champion. You are, I mean,
SPEAKER_01: very strong puller. You have beaten very big names. But on January 21st, maybe one of the most important days of your career. Yeah. And if you win this, you're going to get two titles. The amateur title you already have now, the professional title at the same time. So this is, I think, a very important moment for you.
SPEAKER_02: the most important moment i think for my career and also this is the dream match you know james when i was little kid i was watching him how he pulls with the biggest stars in north america dream match he's a legend i i admit that i can't say other thing thank you but for me will be honored to pull him yeah about whenever whenever whenever
SPEAKER_01: Like you think about the match, you close your eyes. Like, do you see yourself pinning him, beating him? Do you see that? Do you believe that? Again, I wake up with Jerry. I eat with Jerry. I sleep with Jerry. I train with Jerry. I think all the day for him, you know, all the time he's in my head. So you are locked. You are locked there to the target. So there is no way, no way that he can escape. You're going to destroy him.
SPEAKER_01: correct okay yeah that's it you know that's it jerry you are in serious trouble my friend serious trouble each guy sleeps eats drinks wakes up with you all day and whenever he sees you he will be like the bull whose soul red you know so i i'm glad i i want his his best version to show up on the table
SPEAKER_00: so we uh we can have a great match right and uh i'm excited to pull him i i uh i think him winning the waf is uh a great accomplishment i think that uh you know where he is the heavier opponent you know there's not a lot of people i go up against that are heavier than me and uh you know i'm looking forward to it do you see do you see him beating you no no no
SPEAKER_00: I don't ever visualize anyone beating me. And I mean, kind of crazy. That's like telling yourself the brain that, you know, your body's going to lose, right? But whenever, sometimes you see the risk a little bit bigger, sometimes that you see the risk a little bit smaller, like the truth, you know, just like, how do you see that you're going to beat this guy? Yes. Right. I'm, I'll be stronger and faster.
SPEAKER_00: And I think I've been doing it a long time, so I know when I put myself, you know, in the match, I'll feel what he's doing and I'll feel what I need to do, right? So I'm not going to go in unready, right? So I'll be ready when the match goes. And I think...
SPEAKER_00: Like when I went against Genadi, the first match, and I underestimated him, right? And he was super strong and great opponent. And I don't want to do the same thing, right? Because I don't want to go down 1-0.
SPEAKER_00: And I definitely want to be prepared. So I think that first match is going to be pivotal and I want to be ready. So I don't want to come from behind. Right. So I want to make sure I get out early. Yeah. The thing is, Jerry, Kennedy is much more well-rounded.
SPEAKER_01: than Gyorgy. He can pull hook, he can pull dead wrist, he can pull top row, but he is divided to many, many different techniques. While Gyorgy is like, his speciality is totally like 100% outside. And Genadi beat you two rounds with outside, but just
SPEAKER_01: also from me a friendly you know suggestion this guy's outside skill is better than um yeah but but i mean is it is it all about the outside skill because outside skill means top on someone but i think gennady to beat you twice was more about his finishing pressure right
SPEAKER_00: I think my second loss to Genadi was me being stupid.
SPEAKER_00: uh i should have uh slipped yeah instead of doing it i out of stupidity the match i held on and uh my hand had slipped down and i was grabbing at his wrist and so i mean that's how i i train practicing pulling other other opponents to get stronger grab them low so that they get the advantage but
SPEAKER_00: It was a mistake. And, you know, he was super strong and I should have never went into that position and should have slipped. But that's all right. Yeah. Do you think that they want something from each side less than half inch pad? Is it a disadvantage for you or it doesn't make difference?
SPEAKER_00: Well, as long as it was added onto the front and not just the back, like when the WAL did it, they added it just onto the back, which was a disadvantage to me because I couldn't get my arm closer. So as long as it's on the front and the back, I think it's just more pad to move around.
SPEAKER_00: Ideally, it's fine. It'll be more of an advantage for him than it will be for me. But it's not as much of a disadvantage for me that it would cause me to be in fear. You know what I'm saying? But it's definitely more of an advantage for him. I understand. Yeah. Another question, Jerry. When you pulled Genadi, you came here like your return match after a long break.
SPEAKER_01: do you think that right now you are even stronger than that shape yeah as well as you know i i had hurt my shoulder uh yeah people are asking that too
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I had hurt my shoulder training to beat Hermes. And I had went down to Baltimore and I went down and arm wrestled a whole bunch of guys and that's where I initially did the damage. And I figured it was just gonna heal, it was gonna be fine. And then I was training harder and I ended up having a partial tear.
SPEAKER_00: and um but you know i i rested so i don't know if i'll be stronger because i still have a month i'll be stronger than i was against gennady when i go again but um i i don't um i didn't like that month that i literally did nothing i i looked at weights and thought about training but didn't do anything because i didn't want to try to train and mess up my uh mess up my yeah
SPEAKER_01: But Jerry, sometimes when you train such a long time, nonstop, sometimes that one month break may be even helpful, you know, that all those even minor injuries and everything, you just recover like a, like a, do you know how it is that you have the, you know, the arrow, you know, just, you know, that one month is this one, but it makes you go even further, you know, faster. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think I healed up pretty good and I think I feel no pain, no injuries. So I'm excited. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you, Georgi, any kind of pain, any kind of... Because you said sometimes you train twice a day. You Bulgarians are interesting about that.
SPEAKER_02: sometimes you guys can train twice a day every day and then i'm like i don't know how they do that and do you think that you are i mean how do you feel that um sometimes i have a little pain but with time you adapt with this pain it's um it's not a problem for me and so now i think the time
SPEAKER_02: much stronger than the world championship in Turkey. I gained five kilograms and I didn't have so much time to prepare for Turkey. And now I think that I'm stronger, maybe 10 or 15%, which is a lot in our sport, you know. How many percent? 10 to 15%, I think that I'm stronger. Right now or you will be one month later? No, right now, right now.
SPEAKER_01: then one month later maybe one ten percent more maybe up to 20 percent totally yes yes yes and then that they will be enough to destroy jerry right yes i think that they will help me a lot no chance for him i like that do they do they sell lottery tickets in where he's from
SPEAKER_01: yeah they still you you have a better chance of winning the lottery that was good yeah yeah we will see just honestly again i know you said you can win but how do you see the chances of winning people makes fun with me when i ask this way they call me percentage union
SPEAKER_01: I think 60% are for me. How much? 60%. 60% for you and 40% for Jerry. Yes, I think that. This is my opinion. This is your honest opinion or you're trying to intimidate him? No, this is my honest opinion for the match. If I try to intimidate him, I would say 99%.
SPEAKER_00: Ah, okay, okay. And Jerry, what's your chance? 99. I think if I was to put a real number to it, you got to respect that he won the WAF. You got to respect that he's strong. You got to respect that, you know, he's... How old are you, Yogi? I'm 34 years old.
SPEAKER_00: okay so you know he's he's uh still young uh i'm gonna go eighty percent me and uh twenty percent yogi and that's you know and that's just uh he's a nice guy he's a nice guy also
SPEAKER_00: Listen, everyone in the sport I really like, you know, and there's very few people I dislike. And we both do the same sport. We both want to be the best. So we both want to win. I don't think bad of anyone. And
SPEAKER_00: i love when people are uh you know training to go against me and they think that they can win because i want the best version of them i don't want to be a bad version of anyone so uh i wanted to come in prepared and i love the challenge right so i love knowing that i'm going to go against someone that i have to focus on and i have to train and i have to make sure that i'm ready to beat because for me it's going to raise my level and make it so i got to be the best version of jerry and uh i think
SPEAKER_00: it's it's at 80 20 obviously it's it's my number it's my mind right and it's uh what i thought right so that 20 that's that's pretty good because even at a 20 that's a one in five so that means he could win one out of five matches but we won't make it to the fifth match oh okay okay yeah you don't change you'll be after three zero after pool you can beat him yeah see
SPEAKER_01: anyway so jeremy jeremy coleman coleman yeah his forearm looks like it is pregnant with triplets they call your forearm i think they they think that your forearm looks like a pregnant belly which is as three babies in it i think
SPEAKER_00: And the answer does Jerry think Devon versus Kennedy would be close. I do. I think, uh, I, I would like to see that match. I would really like to see that match. I think that Genadi is stronger. Devon is smarter, but where Genadi has so many tools, I would just, I would love to see that match. Yeah. Do you realize that, you know, you will have the title if you beat Jerry.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah and and and then if you beat him who would you like to pull against or right now you just want to focus on in jerry uh if i beat jerry i would like to pull maybe with dave chaffee it's a dream for me also uh okay okay or maybe michael dot but
SPEAKER_01: I understand. Dave Chaffee is a dream match for me. There are some pullers as of now ranked a little bit higher than them. Both Morozov and Genadi have wins against Dave lately. Yeah, but they are from West, you know. I want to pull guys from North America, from West.
SPEAKER_02: From here, my dream match is against Uevam. I want to play against Uevam again. Everybody wants to pull him. Do you think that in the future you may be ready for him someday? Yes, I think that one day if I prepare very well for a long time period, I think that I can win.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you have won against him in the past. Yes, yes. A lot of wins in the past, yeah. When he was playing in the World and European Championships. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so... Okay, now we understand that Jerry is saying 80% he's going to beat you. You say 60% you're going to beat him.
SPEAKER_01: and then you are saying that you will be very patient and then you're working on your endurance so that Jerry will be the one who will guess out and he will say, okay, I'm tired, Georgi, you're the man, and he will give up and then he will give the shield to you. That's what you're saying. Jerry, is it possible to guess out? I've never lost a long match.
SPEAKER_01: except probably by fouls or yeah yeah but i'm saying i've never been pinned by a long match uh i think i saw john stop you here long time long time and then bro when i was 20 okay maybe maybe when i was 20 not 20 but maybe 27 2000 harley pool you were 1973 born but at that time you were 253 pounds so almost like 100 pounds
SPEAKER_01: Not almost, but like, just say like what? 75 pounds. Yeah. Like the overall, are you talking about? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think, I think they will Randall won those supers. You won the two 53 is John one, but two 20, you know? Yeah. That one. Yeah. Yeah. It was, it was a long one. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, let's see how it will be. I just can't wait. And you, Jerry, is there anyone that you want to pull after that? Normally, it would be Hermes. But Hermes is going to pull about one and a half months or one month after that, probably in Dubai. That is expected, but we don't know. They will say. But we may have another event in April.
SPEAKER_01: And like, because I don't think that if he pulls in early May, I don't, March, I don't think he can pull in April to prepare. Like, would you consider to pull against someone like Morozov? I want to pull Ermias or Levan, right? I have a passion to pull Ermias because after,
SPEAKER_00: Well, I was anxious to pull him. I was getting ready to pull him, and I got hurt training to pull him. But as I told you, I would have still pulled, but it would have only been like 60%. It was smarter to not do it. I think that my style, after watching Hermes with Dave, it's not going to go well for Hermes. Yeah, even though you saw him,
SPEAKER_01: being able to do transition the shoulder pressure yeah but dave doing my move is not me doing my move right so you are saying that hermes wouldn't have
SPEAKER_00: opportunity to get behind and say, absolutely not. Dave had him in that position and didn't finish. He went too far across the table and didn't get enough upper body strength behind it. And, uh, I think a strong dude, but Dave doing my move is not me doing my move, you know? So I think that Hermes would, Hermes would not be able to stop me in my move. I understand.
SPEAKER_01: So you are saying that in Dubai, what if Lewand puts his hammer, if they pull, I don't know if they are going to pull or not, but if they pull, if Lewand puts his hammer and then ask Hermes to put his shield to the table, and then if, we don't know who's going to win.
SPEAKER_01: If somehow, okay, doesn't matter either of them, if they win, would you want to pull them like sometime in like July? Yeah. Or you are in it? Yeah, either one of those two people. So you are saying that let them put the shield and the hammer on the table so that there will not be confusion.
SPEAKER_01: are saying right that that that you whenever you pull one of them he will be the one that who has the title for to determine and the question is do you think you have chance against lebanon yeah yeah but like don't you think his side pressure may be like too strong or
SPEAKER_00: don't think there's a question on how strong he is i think watching him beat his opponents he's beating elite level opponents easy right but the way he beats him is he's pulling him you know straight over and they're not getting their body behind i don't think he's not faster than them devin got a hit on him dave got a hit on him he caught both and pinned both i think with if i can get into my position with him
SPEAKER_00: I think he's going to try and grab me low and in grabbing me low, it's going to, you know, I believe would allow me to get deep right with him because I don't think he's going to grab me high. And if I can get positioned behind my hand quick enough, I feel pretty confident. I think if he was able to pull me away from my hand,
SPEAKER_00: right and not allow my shoulder to get behind that it would be his match all day right but i don't think uh i just know mentally that the path and the lane that i want to go in when i go against him so i i see myself doing it and i see myself getting behind it and if he can beat me
SPEAKER_01: with my shoulder and my hand with my shoulder behind my hand and i can't right and lights out to him you know he he would be the superior being because i don't know you are saying that after you get your position it's you don't think that he can beat you after the position correct and and you georgie uh would you want to pull do like if you beat jerry like you know
SPEAKER_01: If you beat Jerry, you will have the title. Yes. Yeah. And then because we have interim title, which Hermes has, like, would you would you pull Hermes? Yes, of course. I won't pull him. Do you think his style is even better for you? Yes, I think that his style is better for me because he's also a top rower.
SPEAKER_02: i think that i'm heavier than him and my head is bigger and i think that i will be not comfortable uh for him not you know many people doesn't know that you beat zaur yes yeah i beat him yeah you beat him yeah you beat him twice last year three times how do you with three times last year
SPEAKER_01: two times on the left hand and one time on the right hand. Oh, okay, but the right hand I'm talking about. Yeah, yeah, right hand. Right hand you beat him at Dwarf, right? Yes. And then after you beat him at Dwarf, about eight months later, he beat both, no, three of them. He beat Ferit, he beat Laletin, and he beat Slay, right? He beat three of them. Yes, yes. Yeah. So if people are, I mean, underestimating you, that there is only
SPEAKER_01: And then I think if I'm not mistaken, only two months or three months before you beat him at WAF, he also beat Morozov in the
SPEAKER_01: the Siberian event. The Siberian bear, yes. In Russia, yes. He defeated Morozov. He defeated Ramov, Morozov, all of them very easy on right hand. He beat Dzeranov and he beat Morozov. He beat all of them. And then he came to WAF and then you beat him. Yes, my second match was against him on the qualifications on right hand. My second match was against him. I beat him.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah i mean he lost the control like this and he fouled out as far as yes because he was losing you know yeah he's strong without wrist yeah yeah i remember yeah i remember yeah and and yeah so the okay so so what at least we know that you are very effective against the top rollers yeah yeah but i saw you
SPEAKER_01: pulling with, remember, Mehdi from Iran. I think it was the Balkan Cup or something, Balkan event. No, it was Elite Top 8 competition in Bulgaria. Yeah, but I will just say that you top-rolled him and you beat him at the end, but once he put his shoulder behind, he gave you some short-time trouble.
SPEAKER_02: yes but uh it was eight years ago during 2014 i was about 30 kilograms uh whiskey it was eight years ago yes yes oh that was long ago wow yeah i was much weaker then now i think i'm stronger much stronger and much bigger yeah see here neil pickup says that
SPEAKER_01: uh georgie and jerry have something in common both lads are often overlooked and underestimated they have often fly under rather while being extremely competitive at the world level level on their day yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway so we will see so yeah you both are doing very well what you do
SPEAKER_01: Jerry's style is bad for you. That's why you are just a little bit changing your way. And then you have another match, another month. And then this is, you see this as your dream opportunity. This is exactly what you told me privately. You wrote to me that it's wintertime, it's very busy.
SPEAKER_01: and normally he doesn't have any time but because he said this is dream and he's gonna use this opportunity and because now you can focus your business as much as you should and then that is why you're gonna punish jail right because of this all that yes i i think only for jerry all the time all day long only for him he's in my mind all the time yeah
SPEAKER_00: Does it make you a little bit intimidated, Jerry, that the guy is just so much focused on you? No? No, I appreciate it, though. I just... I always visualize my opponent and try to tweak whatever that opponent is, try to tweak your training to go towards that opponent. So I've watched his matches. I saw him win the WAF. And I know...
SPEAKER_00: what I need to do to be able to go in. So I'm excited to hear that he's training differently and he wants to try something different. I just don't know if that's going to be the right outlet for him to go. But I mean, we'll see. Right. I mean, hats off to him. He took the match. And I think that I'm
SPEAKER_00: I see myself as winning and I'm confident, but obviously I don't want to be overconfident. So I respect him as my opponent. And I think that it's going to be a good match. I just think that the mistake's going to be if he gets in a long match with me, who's going to get win. Because you are using so much joint pressure
SPEAKER_01: while uh he will be using the muscle is what you are thinking right yes he's gonna go training twice a day you know for his endurance at the table three times a day three times a day no i said he should change three times a day okay see now you know jerry is saying that if you do that three times a day you will be jerry jerry says you will be the true
SPEAKER_00: morning and night he should train morning afternoon and night but you are saying if he does this he will beat you well his chances might go up you know so instead of me winning 80 you know maybe it drops down to 60 like his oh okay okay anyway so let's do a little bit a little bit uh prediction and then finish it okay let's start from ferret versus gennady
SPEAKER_02: I think that Ferit will win because he is very powerful and he is with bigger experience and he is a very smart competitor. I think that Ferit will win for sure. I think that he will top roll him and finish him. Do you think there is any chance that Genadi will hook him? No, I don't think so.
SPEAKER_02: When I saw Ferit fighting in Russia, I think that now he's in very good shape. He won again. He's even bigger and stronger now. I know. He's a very scary guy. Genadi is also very strong, but I think Ferit will win this match. And you, Jerry? Any opinion about that?
SPEAKER_00: I pulled against Genadi, and he's so strong, right? I'm going to go with Genadi, and I haven't ever pulled with Farid. Has Yogi, has he pulled with Genadi? Have you pulled, Yogi? I have never pulled with Genadi, never. Never. Okay. So...
SPEAKER_00: I was asking because you seem super confident about Farid. But I think Farid's good. I just think he's been out of it a bit. And I think that I'll go with Genadi. Yeah, I think in that match anything can happen. It's just like really elite level. Elite, elite, elite, elite level match.
SPEAKER_02: And then Kory versus Arif? I think that Arif will win because Arif is very fast and he is very strong against hookers. I think that Kory will be not able to hook Arif. You think that Kory cannot do this to Arif? No, no. I think that Arif will beat him very easily.
SPEAKER_01: Arif is very dangerous against hookers and he's very fast. He has more experience than Corey also. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And another thing, you remember the match that Ferit beat Laletin, he top-rolled him, but even someone like Laletin was able to a little bit fight like this. Do you think that Genadi may do something like that against Ferit?
SPEAKER_02: I think that it will be a long match, but I think that Ferit will win. It will be a very difficult match, but I think that he will win.
SPEAKER_00: that Arif obviously is going to be the smarter competitor, right? He's been doing it longer. I think he's more knowledgeable, but Corey's so big and so strong, and he's also from the United States. So I got to root for him. Yeah, yeah, I understand, yeah. Yeah, and let's go the other one. Corey versus Ferit, left arm, your game. I think that this fight will be a very easy win for Ferit.
SPEAKER_01: His left arm is very strong and he is very fast. He's maybe the best hooker on left-handed on the planet. In the past, his right arm, right hook was incredible as well, but he got injured, so he had to start toppling, yeah. And Jerry doesn't know much about left arm, but let's ask him about the Corey versus left arm. My left's not that bad. I've never been the best.
SPEAKER_00: What? Never been the best. The right arm's where the money's at, right? Yeah, yeah. Left arm is for the maybe, let's say, state champion. Yeah, yeah, yeah. True, right? But I would go with, I think Farid's going to,
SPEAKER_00: know be impressive left-handed and uh but i still have to root for my man corey right so i can't root against them even though i think uh it's going to be a learning experience for corey
SPEAKER_00: is you know the dude's 400 pounds right and he's super strong and he trains hard so if he can slow him down i think that it it could be an interesting match the problem is can he slow him down but either way i'm rooting for corey yes yes i understand yeah and john burzing versus directly
SPEAKER_02: This is a difficult prediction, but I think that Irakli will win because I think that John has a problem with good top rowers. I think that Irakli will top row him. But I'm not sure that he will be able to finish it. But I think that this will be a win for Irakli. My opinion, I shared before,
SPEAKER_01: if they go top row versus top if john tries to hook iraqli fresh round iraq is gonna beat him badly yes i don't know how to hook him especially in a fresh round if john goes top row and iraq of course will go top row if their wrist stays like flat together like flat then john john wins that one with side yeah yeah yeah if john top rolls iraqli it will still win
SPEAKER_01: But if Irakli wants to win, he needs to really take Jones' wrist and make sure that he has some wrist not flat like this. So it is all about Irakli's wrist control, in my opinion. Yeah. But I don't know. And you, Jerry, what's your opinion about this match? I think Irakli, you know, he trains with Levan. He's a beast. He gets better every time we see him compete.
SPEAKER_00: I'm excited to see this match. I think it's going to be really good.
SPEAKER_00: But John has the endurance to be able to hang with Iraq Lee. And like you said, with Iraq Lee being so dominant, John has to be able to take that dominance away from him. And John's not an explosive puller. He's more of a defensive puller. So I think John knows what he has to do. There's no one smarter than John. So it's just a matter of- No doubt.
SPEAKER_00: So he knows what to do. It's just a matter of is he going to have the skill set to be able to do it against a Rockley who's fast. And so I'm anxious to see it. And obviously, I'm going to be rooting for John. Yeah, yeah. And Rustam Babayev and Pauline Yorgi. Rustam has been away, but he will be coming here about four months training. And Pauline,
SPEAKER_01: really surprised me last match against Irakli. Not because he beat Irakli, but he kind of dominated him, you know. It was just kind of too much. So how do you see that match? I think that it will be also a very interesting match, but I think that here Paul Gouin will win because I think he's in better condition now. So Paul Gouin is going to beat Rustam? Yes, I think very difficult, but he will win. This is my opinion. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And you're going to say you support your countrymen, I know. When it is West versus West, most of the players are from one country. While there is your opponent is from Bulgaria, he's the only Bulgarian in the card. While you have so many Americans that I will be asking you, it is harder for you to answer than Gyorgy. One second, Jerry. Gyorgy, I want to ask something. Do you feel yourself like,
SPEAKER_01: part of team West or you just said, I don't care about that. I am pulling against Jerry. The rest are for me, same distance. But do you like, you feel like it is West versus West, you feel it? Or do you like, I'm objective about all of them are to me fellow arm masters. How do you see that? For me, it's 50-50.
SPEAKER_02: I'm from West and I like putting against West and the other parties like no meaningful thing. But I cannot say that you are saying that those are all fellow arm masters, let the better one win in each match. But from one side you are saying that, okay, I'm from West. Yeah. So you are like divided. I cannot tell you. Yes, you are right for that. I cannot say which one exactly. And Jerry, how do you see the Pauline and Rustam?
SPEAKER_00: I think Ruson's been out of it for a while and Paul's been climbing the ladder.
SPEAKER_00: I believe Rustam, when he was at his peak, I believe would be a very tough match for Paul. I don't know, is Rustam coming in where he left out when he was at his peak, right? So I think I'm going to go with Paul on this, obviously, because he's from the United States. But I think Paul has been showing that he's a force. He's been winning the last series of matches he's had. So he's stepping up.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I have some boards on the wall. I'm trying to see all the matches from here, if I can see. But another one, let's go. I'm sure that some of them, I'm not going to even ask you, Jerry. Like if I ask you, Minda Aguas versus Nurdaulet Aydar Khan, you're going to say who? Yeah, yeah, right. So I will only ask Gyorgy. Gyorgy, you know both guys, right? Your followers are missing.
SPEAKER_01: How do you see that? I think that Mindaugas will win, in my opinion. Mindaugas will win? But you know that Aydar Khan took first, Mindaugas took fourth or fifth or something at the waft, but you are saying that one-on-one without the draw he is going to win? One-on-one, he is a very smart guy and I think that he will prepare very much for this fight and I think that he will win.
SPEAKER_01: We will see. It's going to be a good match. It's going to be a very interesting match, but I think it's going to be a good match. This match, Jerry, do you know who Barbora is? Barbora is the current world super heavyweight champion in the women's category. She is like minimum 185 centimeters, just like 6'1".
SPEAKER_01: and she's probably my my estimation is around like 250 pounds but not like she's like you know uh very strong she she's gonna pull against gabriella yeah now who was this 22 years old huh but who was the girl that that gabby pulled when at number four
SPEAKER_01: Oh, it was Egle. It was Egle. Yeah. I thought she was the world champ. No, there is 90 kilo category that she won that year European championship. She has many, but this is super weight. This girl, you will see when you see her, you will realize, but she is not like, you know, classic or no disrespect, but the woman usually pull like finger to finger. This girl is like full wrist, you know, pressure, you know? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: and yeah see chan show is asking you i mean can i corner jerry so after he wins i can claim that we won what chan show is saying that if he can corner you so that after you win he can say that you know yes we won oh you mean have him be in my corner yeah yeah yesterday he was messing with travis travis was my guest travis is coming oh is he
SPEAKER_01: yeah he's coming to as I don't know, maybe referee maybe an answer, maybe a commentator, you know, it will be part of it and Travis is coming back to honesty. yeah that's good. Maybe in April, maybe even. latest last football game so yeah he should come back. yeah yeah and but so chance was messing with. Travis yesterday, but today is not messing with you anyway, so.
SPEAKER_01: Barbora, you don't know. So Gabriela, you know, and any opinions since you don't know, but. Yeah, I'm going to go with, what was the other girl's name? Barbora. I'm going to go with her. Oh, okay. Because I don't know. Gabriela is also very strong. I'm still mad at Gabby when she picked Genadi to win. So I'm going to hold that resentment. Oh, that is why. Okay. Okay. And you, and you, you know, both, both ladies.
SPEAKER_02: i know both of them and i think that barbara will win this fight yes yes i think she will win she's bigger and his her hands are bigger she's not very comfortable he will win this fight gaby's super strong so i mean whoever if they're going to be able to beat her that's going to be pretty impressive yeah yeah yeah anyway so
SPEAKER_01: Ali Canmurado versus Petrenko left arm. I'm not going to ask you that one, Jerry. But Georgi knows that this match is one very, very good match. You know, this guy, Ali Canmurado, Jerry, he's around, like, say, less than 220 pounds. He competed the superweight at WAF, and he won. His left arm is incredible. When Raz Serdekian,
SPEAKER_01: was Rez, right? When he was here, last time he competed, he competed in Zloty Tur. I think Rez took seventh place. This guy is the one that won that category at the last 2018 Zloty Tur. So this guy's left arm, he won many, many, many, many tournaments. He won a left arm tournament where Morozov didn't even make final.
SPEAKER_01: left arm but of course it was the morozov just say two years ago or one and a half year ago or something like maybe two years ago yeah it is not the same morozov today right but yeah and he's gonna pull with petrenko and the petrenko is the guy in 2019 zloty he beat david in the final but he was 95 kilo category so how do you see that much george
SPEAKER_02: I think that Alejandro will win this fight. He is faster, he is very strong. I think that this will be a win for him. What if the match stops? He hits and then the match stops at the middle? I think that Petrenko will be not able to catch him. But what if he stops? If he stops the match, it will be very interesting. I cannot predict.
SPEAKER_01: Porkchop versus Zurab. Do you know Porkchop? Yes. Do you know Porkchop? Who is it? The Curtis Cameron. Devon Lara's training partner. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy that recently beat Ryan Espay. Yeah. Yeah. He's going to pull with the guy Zurab. Do you remember Zurab? Yeah, I remember him too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Any opinion about it? You probably wouldn't know. I haven't seen the other guy compete. Zurab is really good, so I think that it's going to be challenging to have to beat him. Yeah. And Gyorgy? I think that Zurab will win this fight. Yeah, the Canadians are, most of them I see are sure that it's not going to be even close, that he's going to beat Zurab.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure. I think that Zurab will win. He's more experienced and he will be very well prepared, I think. Okay, okay. And another very important match. I will start with Jerry, this one. Michael Todd versus Ungar Babayev. But it is for 231 pounds. 231 pounds. 231? Yeah, Michael walks around 240 lately.
SPEAKER_00: Wow. He was going to go... He's ripped like crazy. Yeah, just crazy to know that he could drop that much weight and still be strong. Because he was going to cut down to, what, 255 and pull Prudnik.
SPEAKER_01: yeah now it's down even lower to yeah but whenever he said that he's gonna put prudny he really like all those times he sees 242 and then he breaks diet and then he sees 255 and then goes down 240. i mean he's just like right there you know playing you know between 240 and 250 you know yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm always going to go with Mike. Mike's a friend of mine, so I'm pulling for Mike to win. Okay. Even though when I was going against Genadi, Rebecca picked me and Mike picked Genadi. Really? So he's still a prick, but I'm still pulling for him.
SPEAKER_00: but no no analyzing about this match no right yeah well i i don't know i'm i'm i'm a little bit leery just because mike at 230 you know i i was competing against mike when he's 280 right so um
SPEAKER_00: to give up 50 pounds, you know, Mike has his move down and he's done it a long time, right? So I think that he's always conditioned. He trains all the time. I think part of Mike's problem is that he over-trains, you know, he trains almost to a fault where he trains too much.
SPEAKER_00: I don't feel like he gives himself enough time to rest, but he just recovered from an injury too, and he was resting. So I think he's going to come back, and he's got something to prove. So I'm anxious to see him compete. I just think that it'll be a tough match.
SPEAKER_00: And I think the reason it'll be tough is because Mike's down to 230, because Mike is a stronger, better competitor than him. But is he that same competitor at 230? So that's going to be interesting to see. I'm anxious to see what Mike looks like at 230, too. That's like Mike from 12 years ago, maybe 50. I won't be surprised after Friday morning weigh-in, the next evening he will be 250 again. I won't be surprised, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: he doesn't eat a lot of shit food though so i mean it's going to be tougher to put the weight back on i mean unless it's he does that he late he does it he says i was 240 and then three days now i am like 258 or something he says you know you know he just he he he i think he is testing that all the time i think and and you george how do you see that match
SPEAKER_02: I think that this will be a very, very interesting match and I think it will be very difficult to predict, but in this category, I think that Ongar Babayev will win. Very difficult, but he will win. Very hard, but he will win. You are saying that usually to beat Michael, you really need to have incredible horsepower.
SPEAKER_01: or you really need to be technical enough to unlock their move. So you think that Ongar Babayev is smart and technical enough to fight against this? Yes, he is very smart and very clever guy. He is super strong.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, one of my favorite tours. I respect also very much Michael very much, but I think category Michael will be not the same because he will lose a lot of weight. I understand and and then we are finishing almost a chance show versus David Arabuli. You ever seen David Arabuli, Georgi? Yes, yes, I know of them. But David Arabuli is last time I remember it was around like Sandris level.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I know, I know. This is again a very interesting match, but I think that Chance will win, in my opinion. I understand. And if I ask Jerry, he doesn't know David Aroble, but as a countryman, are you going to support Chance? Yes, of course.
SPEAKER_01: There is a beef between you and him. But after I beat Genadi, he put it to bed, so it's all good, right? Yeah, he fixed the rankings. He put me back at number one. Oh, okay. So he doesn't say that he can beat you right now anymore? No, no. He doesn't say, okay. Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And then Craig Tullier and Samushia Georgi. Who? Craig Tullier. You know Craig Tullier? Yes, yes. And with Samushia, 85 kilo title. You know, people, Craig Tullier last week lost to Brandon, but he was 91 kilo category, and this is the probably lowest Brandon can make. And so that doesn't affect his title match for 85 kilo. Same with Pauline. Pauline pulled...
SPEAKER_01: 240 category against paulo paulo is a bigger guy and then pauline is gonna pull 209 you know against rustam baba so this has no effect about the matches that they are gonna do both pull you know a little bit heavier than themselves okay how do you see that match do you did you did you watch his match last week with brandon yes uh yes my my opinion he will win this match cool
SPEAKER_01: Samushia. Well, Samushia is going to win. Yes, yes, yes. Let's see how it will be. And you're going to support Craig Tullier. But do you remember Samushia, Jerry? I do. And Craig's an interesting competitor, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It just depends on which version of Craig shows up to the match. Because Craig has surprised me in some matches where I picked him to not win. And I live not far from Rob Vigent Jr, right? And Craig and Rob went at it at Mohegan Sun. And this was a couple of years ago. And I picked Rob to win. And Craig surprised me and ended up winning.
SPEAKER_00: and uh so he was just he was on you know when he's on he's a he's a fierce opponent so if if craig shows up on and i think he's gonna because having just lost to brandon i think is gonna reset a fire in craig and make him
SPEAKER_00: more determined, more driven to make sure that when he goes to this match, he's got to make a mark. And this is on a global stage. So I think being on a global stage like this and a huge feat like this, he's going to want to represent and really make a mark because me and Craig are the same age and been in it probably the same amount of time. So I think Craig's going to look to make this
SPEAKER_01: uh a notch you know so look for craig to be on and i'll go with craig yeah do you know uh doc eric no yes i think you some people pronounce his last name erich erich dog douglas erich yeah he's he's gonna pull also with ribbons do you know uh douglas george yes yes i know
SPEAKER_01: Oh, you know him? Yes. How do you see that match? Oh, I think that Erlich will win. Erlich will win? Yes, yes, yes. I understand. It will be an interesting match, but my opinion again. Yeah, yeah, I understand. We also have Ahmet Yenerer and Robert Baxter.
SPEAKER_01: Robert Baxter, Jerry knows. Ahmet Yenerer, probably he wouldn't know. These guys did the final last year and this year at the WAF Worlds in the Grand Masters. And then last year, Robert Baxter won. This year, Ahmet won. And so they are going to pull against each other. Do you know Ahmet Yenerer? I know both of them. I think that Baxter will win this one. You have pulled him before?
SPEAKER_01: no okay okay yeah anyways guys so let's finish thank you very very much uh and thanks to everyone who watched us and do you have any last word to say to each other jerry i'm coming for you you have to be ready
SPEAKER_00: uh don't don't you worry i'll be ready and be careful what you wish for wishing for me to be ready is a little bit painful i want to be in the best shape of your wife and to destroy you this will be a dream for me well
SPEAKER_00: That dream will have to live on for a different day because it won't be in January. But I still like you, right? And I'm still looking forward to going against you. Just expect the unexpected. Yeah, yeah. And Georgi, you are very, very friendly here, laughing and this. At that table, you will be probably more serious.
SPEAKER_01: Again, I will be like a beast. I will be like a beast. You will see. I will see. Okay. And you will scare this guy, right? You will scare this guy. Yes. Okay. I will be like a machine. What are you showing, Jerry? Can you see that? Look at it. See what? It's my shirt from the number four. Oh. They told me that it has
SPEAKER_01: they're not the spirit in it it does i i'm absorbing it daily yeah and then and then the next one you're gonna hang your spirit in it and then you're gonna hang on the wall right it's not like there's spirits right it sucks out of the competitor okay and then brings it right into me bam and then more power for next time yeah i train in that
SPEAKER_01: will be it will be good match it will be good match people people doesn't know about georgie a lot from the west but they will they will they will my guess i will just say it will be a good match usually the good match is in the favor of jerry but you are saying that you're training your endurance and you will be patient and you will be watching your elbow to not to get out right georgie yeah that will be very good about my elbows
SPEAKER_01: okay i i trained only this time yeah believe me your team your team is one of the best team in the world you know with all those world champions and everything and then they they not they are not only helping you for the train but they are also helping you with the advices and everything right yeah yeah yeah so then it means that jerry is in huge big big big big trouble it's okay okay anyway so
SPEAKER_01: I love to tease Jerry. Anyways, thank you very much, Jerry. And very soon I'll see you in less than five weeks, my friend. Thank you for joining. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. And thank you, Gary. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Train hard. Shaw us the forearm again. Ooh. By the forearm size, Jerry, it is really, as he says, 64. Bye.
SPEAKER_01: Take care. Take care. Take care.
