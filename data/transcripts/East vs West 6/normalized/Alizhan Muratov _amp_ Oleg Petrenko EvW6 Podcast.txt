SPEAKER_03: That is 100% in shape can flash level on a team is move could be dangerous. Not true my friends, I don't think that there's been any. person in the history that. knows. A.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, how do you know if the community is ready for more matches, more categories, paperweight numbers? My friend, I will tell you something. The truth. Okay, just listen, like I'm saying from the heart. The money that I invest to organize for many categories, left arm, right arm, lightweight, super heavyweight, middleweight, welterweight, woman, you know, I do this
SPEAKER_03: so that arm wrestling can become, many people can become popular because there are a lot of people who deserve to be popular. So what I try to do, I try to give this opportunity both to athletes and the fans. The athletes can use this stage so they can promote themselves on the stage and outside of the stage because once their match is set there,
SPEAKER_03: I mean, they, I was thinking that, you know, like many of them does, but still, you know, not only the community, some of the athletes are still need to try harder, you know, just to promote themselves because the fans, like fans likes to know these athletes as their personality, if they share their trainings, what is their goal, you know, and
SPEAKER_03: what is their target for the future, even about the life and everything. We don't need to be all of us. We don't need to be like Devon Laras. Devon Laras is a very successful person, but we all are created different. We have different personalities. We have, how to say, we have different... Hello, hello, Paolo. Thank you. Different personality. I mean, we don't need to be one type. Life would be so boring. People would want to get to know what
SPEAKER_03: This guy is so so I in short I I wanted everyone to build their own fan base their own story they're just to be in touch with the with the friends, so that fans could really follow like like, for example, what what Ryan bone is do is. And then he's on daily basis sharing.
SPEAKER_03: what he's thinking you may like him or you don't like him a lot of people likes him a lot of people doesn't like him it's different but he has his own fan base even though he's not the like most elite but he is successful so people doesn't have to be like Ryan if you say that okay not everyone they don't have to be like Habib he's quiet but he has his own way McGregor has his own way Mayweather his own way we all are different we are our master we don't have to be like them some of us can be
SPEAKER_03: quite respectful but still you can also share what is in you you understand and so this from the same side like i also wanted the community to know this atlas but whenever just say i'm saying for example you invest something you have a budget right so what i'm just saying when you divide your budget to 16 matches understand it's different like you can just i can set
SPEAKER_03: i can tell you honestly that i can set two matches with the same badges that i'm spending for 16 matches and i could get like three four times more pay-per-view that that wasn't my target that is not my target you understand but you can go as far as the community is ready for this community says that you know indeed yes this is what we want to build and then i go there but if community doesn't want
SPEAKER_03: You cannot blame the community. Community says that, you know, I made a poll. I said, are you a hardcore fan? It's 22%. Are you following only a few at least? 47%. Almost twice more than hardcore fans, you know. And these are people who are following my channel. If it is the case on my channel like this, imagine how it is in general. So I'm just saying,
SPEAKER_03: Right now, when I say we are not ready, it is nobody's fault. It's not my fault. It's not Atlas' fault. It's not community's fault. We are just not ready. There is nothing to like say that, oh, you know, it's bad or something. There is no bad guy in this story. We are just not ready for that. Yeah, I mean, they can use translation, my friend. They can use, they can just write the translation and everything, you know, just.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah anyway so everything is okay we just need to give the community uh what they want from us so that is i'm still gonna do minimum 10 matches still you can't say that it's not gonna build anything it's gonna build a lot but don't expect like 15 16 matches because that is
SPEAKER_03: you do whatever community is what what do you think about all all this is what do you think about this project
SPEAKER_01: uh well yeah i saw your post and uh i i think you're right and uh it's a it's very much depends on the vision of yours but uh i think you're right that the quality versus quantity always works so yeah i mean i mean listen listen no no i i don't think sorry i will have to disagree with that when you say quality versus quantity when you say quantity
SPEAKER_03: We are talking about all these guys are world champions. Their quality is right here. That is to get the quantity and quality I provide. Like, let's say... But this is for us, for arm wrestlers, right? I'm talking right now. What's quality? Listen, but you are saying quality. The quality, I mean, at least you need to say from your side, like, Barrett's world champion, Genadi's world champion.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, Zuroff World Champion, Ike Beket World Champion, Minda Aguas Loti Champion, Nur Dalet World Champion, Tsvetkov World Champion, Jerry World Champion, Ali Caniz World Champion, Petrenko, Gabriela, Barbora, Samushia,
SPEAKER_03: I mean, there is nothing more quality than this one, you know. No, no, absolutely. For us, for our masters, it's absolutely. But for our...
SPEAKER_01: masses who is uh actually our fans and uh who is not really closely watching all the arm wrestling but you know fans watching for uh top guys and for them uh as you said they they're not ready for uh for this so slowly again in a few years when when everybody will be recognizable you know then uh maybe it will be
SPEAKER_03: I was still confused, but maybe we shouldn't say quality, quantity. We should say popularity. Popularity, yeah. You know, yeah, yeah, yeah. This can't be explained with quantity, you know, just like many of these matches could be the main matches, you know. Anyway, so, yeah, we are waiting for Alizhan to come. And can you tell, it is sad, you know, in fact, Alizhan and I, we are speaking the same language.
SPEAKER_03: know but we came from middle asia to here let's say like a thousand years ago but even we talk right now uh we talked like if two months we spent together we would understand each other very very well even now i understand partly but now we will have to talk communicate through uh russian translation yeah
SPEAKER_01: Let me ask a couple of questions. Olezhan, hello. My name is Pasha. Do you speak Russian well? Do you understand? Hello, Pasha. Hello, I understand everything. You speak well and understand. Okay, okay. Well, yes, we will try. Because Oleg, he will probably speak Ukrainian. I speak both Ukrainian and Russian. I think I will try to translate only Russian. If you don't understand something, then re-ask me, I will help you.
SPEAKER_03: One guy asked, like, hello, don't you vote for hardcore fans of all levels? No, no, my friend. Their hardcore fans are...
SPEAKER_03: so big so what i just tried to say that my friend um
SPEAKER_03: the level of hardcore fans are not enough to support the next level. When I say this, it is like UFC, their hardcore fans are enough to support the level of the UFC right now, the league and everything. Hardcore fans
SPEAKER_01: level the the the the the how to say the the percentage is not enough to push us to that level yet so that's all i say okay let's start and give me 10 seconds i will talk to both guys to make sure because we have ukrainian russian uh to make sure what am i doing okay yeah uh
SPEAKER_01: Are you going to answer in Ukrainian or Russian? I think Alizhan won't fully understand Ukrainian. Ukrainian. You'll speak Ukrainian, right? I don't speak Russian very well. Yes, I'll speak Ukrainian. Okay, no problem. Then I'll give you some time to translate into English, and if Alizhan doesn't understand something, I'll translate it for him. He speaks Russian, but not very well.
SPEAKER_01: Oleg will answer in Ukrainian. If you don't understand something, slow me down a little bit and I will give you some tips. Great. I got everything. We'll straighten it out. What are you going to do? Ukrainian, Russian, Ukrainian, Russian? I will have to do it. I'll figure it out.
SPEAKER_03: Hello, Oleg. How are you, my friend? Hello. Petrenko started to learn some English. They're going to meet next week. Let's start with what they expect from this match. Can you ask them what they think about their opponent?
SPEAKER_01: like how they see their own chances, things like that. Okay, yeah, he says, well, you two will meet next week. And he asks, what do you expect from this fight, from this match? I'll start with Olezhan. Olezhan. We expect an honest fight, first of all.
SPEAKER_02: Alizhan said that he is expecting a fair pulling.
SPEAKER_01: and uh to make sure that uh it's a memorable match and uh he wants to see it as so our uh fans having fun and uh yeah that's that's what the region says okay this is in in he doesn't have any any personal like expectation he doesn't say anything you can ask him you know
SPEAKER_02: How does he see his winning chance?
SPEAKER_01: So I can't say that I'll win or lose, but I'm getting ready for this fight. He's getting ready, maybe not everything as he would like to be because of the work, but he's getting ready and he's getting ready to win. Only Allah knows exactly, but he's getting ready to win. He's coming to win, but he doesn't like to talk.
SPEAKER_03: like so much confident because he knows he cannot control the future he will do his best yes the rest of okay yeah and then can you ask same question to oleg petrenko these guys they're like super super super respectful guys to each other yes yes
SPEAKER_02: Because I prepared well, I added from the last West-West 5. Made the best form. Well, I hope for a good fight, a bright one, so that people will remember, like it. My chances of winning, I've never fought the Alizhan, so I can't say with confidence that I will win. Well, I'm ready to win. I think the chances are 50 to 50. Something like that.
SPEAKER_01: Of course. Lijan, can I help you a little bit?
SPEAKER_01: No, a little bit, yes, I understand. Yes, well, he says that he prepared well, his form is better than it was in West vs. West 5, West vs. West 5, that is, he added more. And he hopes to win, he says, but he has never fought with Alizhan, so he evaluates his chances as 50-50, he says, we'll fight, we'll see. And, well, that's basically it, but he expects a bright, good fight, a memorable one.
SPEAKER_01: okay now english uh uh yeah petrenko says that uh he's expecting uh a bright match uh and uh yeah he's ready he's bringing the better
SPEAKER_01: form uh than he was at uh east versus west five and uh uh he gained about a kilo and a half in the mess and uh he's ready uh his chances his chances for winning he said i never pulled alijan so and he knows that he's a good opponent and uh he said 50 50 we will see yeah yeah yeah he's coming to win for sure yeah yeah i mean both both are coming yeah i mean
SPEAKER_03: You can't blame anyone for coming to win. Nobody is coming to lose. And it's good. And can you ask Oleg if what concerns him the most is the explosiveness of Ali-Chance? Oleg, what bothers you the most about him being so explosive?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, the most important thing is to stop his start. I watched his matches. I have known Alizhan for a long time that he is a very strong athlete. I watched him. He even won the World Cup recently. It's very strong, not in his category. And yes, it seems to me, well, not that it seems, I am sure that his main crown is a quick start and this burst.
SPEAKER_02: So I will do my best to stop it.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, Alizhan, he says that he has known you for a long time, watched you, he says that you are a very talented athlete, you won the world championship, not in your category. He says, yes, I know, most of all, he may not bother him, but he knows that your crown movement is very explosive, and he says, well, we need to stop the match, then we will already fight if we can stop it.
SPEAKER_01: okay yeah he said that yes you're right uh that uh explosiveness is uh the most uh most uh problem a problem or a powerful move from alijan and uh he said that yes i will have to stop the match first and then when the match is stopped then we can we can you know continue the actual match and we'll see
SPEAKER_01: And he also said that Alizhan is a very respectful athlete. And he's been watching him. And he knows that he won the last world championship, not in his weight class. So he said, yeah, I'm ready. Yeah. And can you also ask Alizhan that he is lighter? Normally he is one category below. But he is so good enough that
SPEAKER_03: we offer him a match in one category above. And we know that his main weapon is the explosiveness. But if the match is balanced, does he trust his endurance as much as his speed?
SPEAKER_01: Aljan, we know that you often play in your own categories. And now you are also in the same category, so it's a little easier for you. It is known that your explosion at the start is your crown movement. But do you trust your endurance and strength if the match stops? Yes, of course. Everyone thinks that I am only fast.
SPEAKER_01: he said that uh yeah no problem absolutely uh he said uh everybody thinks that i'm only fast but it's it's it's not only i'm also strong and uh my endurance is on point no problem
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah yeah i i remember his matches from 2017 love in youth category he pulled against one of my students at that time that they had like two minutes to war you know with my students and alijan managed to won yeah so i remember his endurance if you can translate him
SPEAKER_01: He said, yes, I remember your fight in 2017. You were still a junior with some of his students. He didn't say his name. He said, yes, I remember. We fought for two minutes and you won. Mohamed Gamushoglu? Yes. You have a book? Good book. Good book. Why? Because you know how to work, right?
SPEAKER_01: he asked what was the question and i said there was no question he just that you just commented that here you remember his match yeah yeah he had a long match he even uh remembered the name of the opponents that i trained
SPEAKER_03: they had a war in hook two minutes he went there there there you know and and then alijan three days later or four days later he completed the seniors after those wars and then he took first in the senior senior category also right alicia yes yes
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so let's, and can you ask him his current form, his best ever form?
SPEAKER_02: Are you in your best shape now or was it better before? No, it was better before. You know, when I used to train, when I was in the best shape, I was, so to speak, not a family man, without work.
SPEAKER_02: Do you spend more time with your family and work? I have more obligations now. Sport is more in the background now. Because of this, I can't spend a lot of time in sports now. Tell me, I know what you're going to ask. In percentage, approximately? Well, I don't know now. 20 percent, probably.
SPEAKER_02: Because I can't train hard right now.
SPEAKER_01: In any case, we are people, we need to exist, we need to work, maintain a family. So, in any case, we need to work. Yeah, he said that, unfortunately, no, not the best shape in my life. Because previously he was single and his main job was armwrestling. Now he has a job.
SPEAKER_01: family to take care of and unfortunately he cannot uh dedicate to sport 100 of his time so uh he said uh probably 20 less than he best peak form uh and he said yeah i have a little more responsibilities and unfortunately i'm not not in the best form in my life yeah at the wolf we didn't seem like that what's what to do
SPEAKER_02: He says, yes, but in the competition it didn't look like you were in the best shape. Yes. Well, then, to be honest, I wasn't in the best shape. But now, before this competition, when I was in Turkey, I wasn't in the best shape right now. Well, at the moment. And then less.
SPEAKER_02: Well, at this competition, I was preparing, then my jaw broke in the competition. Because of this, I already have such an internal, how to say,
SPEAKER_02: Well, it's not standard or how to say it correctly. Disbalance, yes. Whether it will happen or not. And here's the last moment. When was it? When a month, it seems, remained after the competition. Maybe a month and a half. Then it was decided that we would fight with Petrenko. Because of this, I had something internal. Well, there was some kind of de-motivation. I was no more motivated to do it. Because of this, I...
SPEAKER_02: Okay, yeah, he said, yeah, it's at the valve, it was a little better even for him than right now because
SPEAKER_01: don't know how to properly translate it uh uh the the schedule with rock was set and then something goes wrong and uh you know he he stopped his training a little bit and got a little demotivated now uh the match is set back so the the preparation was not straightforward and uh that uh he cannot explain that straightforward but his internal motivating
SPEAKER_01: was you know shifted a little bit so but he's not yeah can you can you ask him so he is not so hopeful about this upcoming event
SPEAKER_02: In any case, there is, but I just wanted to say that it was about the form, not cowardice or anything. In any case, I am spiritually and morally prepared for any competition. I don't have to go and lose. In any case, I'm going to win.
SPEAKER_02: But I can't say that I will win or lose. So we never know the outcome of the future competition. So we all hope only for the best. And we are not afraid of anything. That's all.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he said that, no, absolutely not. He has great hopes for this upcoming event. And he said, we've been talking about my physical form, which is, I told you the truth, but my mental preparation is on point. And he said, it's not always depends on, you know, only physique. And I'm coming to win. And, you know, we never know what the future will bring us, but I'm coming to win mentally ready.
SPEAKER_03: yeah just tell him that if you can um that the starts are always like the hardest parts and then when you start and then you start successful the things get better in many different ways
SPEAKER_01: I have to understand what I'm translating, you know. Engin said that the most important thing is the beginning. And he says that when you start, then these circles become better and better every time. The most important thing is to start. Yes, yes, to start. I recently started to compete because of that. Now I need to roll around. I need to compete more. That's right.
SPEAKER_01: ready again what's that yeah he said he said he said yeah thank you and he said yeah that's right yeah getting ready and we will we will make uh may make it happen it will be better and can you ask now oleg that uh does he see this match um as a good opportunity for the uh security in the future events
SPEAKER_02: Oleg, do you see this upcoming match as an opportunity to fix yourself for the next event, for the next competition? Yes, of course, I would like to fight. And it motivates me that I can choose a title in 105 categories and prove to everyone that I can fight the strongest.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you, Engin, for giving me the opportunity to prove to everyone that I can do it. Yes, first a little bit in Russian. Elijan says yes, absolutely yes. I hope to win and that I will be able to fight further at these competitions.
SPEAKER_01: He thanked Engin for the opportunity. He said, well, you are a top athlete, respect. And he says, thank you for the opportunity to fight top athletes. I will try to prove that I am also in the top and deserve and have the opportunity to fight for the title.
SPEAKER_01: Engin, yeah, he said yes. He said yes. I hope that I will be able to pull in the future events. And thank you for the opportunity to pull. And it's a lot of respect for a top athlete like Alizhan. And thank you to you, Engin, for the opportunity to pull the elite top pullers. And he hopes to win this title. And he's ready to prove that. And for the future as well. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: he's ready to prove that he's yes yeah um um paulo um this is uh i have huge respect for this atlas not only these two but many of those people that you know and my dream was to i mean make these events maybe even more often so that these athletes can really become professional athletes
SPEAKER_03: when I said professional, when you make something, money from armwrestling, I don't think it's exactly making you a professional. If this is your profession and if you make living out of this, then I think that you can become really a professional athlete. So that is my goal. But it seems like, as I today explained it,
SPEAKER_03: the community is not ready to because it's new very new and many of them are following the sport only because of a few names so i don't think that somebody just told that ufc also has the hardcore and this but ufc's hardcore is enough to turn you know what is up there you understand
SPEAKER_03: art is not ready to put it up there we are not that big yet so that so that is why i think that from now on it will be uh harder harder to be invited here because it's getting more and more and more elites so the only strong
SPEAKER_01: your wife's point you know it's you understand my point right paulo yes absolutely yeah you're you're smart guy but maybe i am the one that who is not expressing uh clearly enough so that you're absolutely clear you're absolutely clear i hope my translation is clear enough to people you know russian speaking yeah i understand what you're saying but uh let me try to summarize what you said uh
SPEAKER_01: is at the top now. He says, I'm trying to go to my competitions in such a way as to help our athletes get to the point when they become professionals. In the sense that not only did they earn a little bit of money, but that they live due to the fact that they are armwrestlers. That is, they should no longer run to some other jobs.
SPEAKER_01: He said, yes, you need to work so that they can live from this. He says, that's why I'm making some changes, I'm doing a little less supermatches, the number of supermatches. He says, well, maybe we can develop this sport more and bring it closer to UFC, MMA. And then, he says, maybe we will have more, we will grow, there will be more money.
SPEAKER_01: yeah okay so let's go how how it will be okay as we
SPEAKER_03: Today what we found out is that Ali Can physically is 20% behind his best ever shape, but mentally he's super ready. And Oleg is even stronger than the last time we saw him. And he's also ready to win. So let's see. So maybe we start talking about some other matches. And I don't know if they all know those names, but
SPEAKER_01: I will ask, like, Alizhan, do you know Corey West? Alizhan, do you know who Corey West is? Who? Corey West. Do you know who he is? Who? Corey West, an American. I don't know. Is he big? Do you know him? Does he fight? He fights, yes. No, he doesn't know him.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so I tried to figure out which matches he would know. Oleg, do you know Corey West? Oleg, do you know who Corey West is? Oleg, how do you expect Corey West and Ferit Osmanli to win?
SPEAKER_02: I know Farid personally, so I will root for Farid. But I can't say for sure that Farid will win. I think that Farid should win because of his experience. Because he is more talented, as far as I know. And he has more experience. And I think that he could have won if it wasn't for his physical strength and technique.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, yeah, he said that he knows personally Farid and he will root for him. And he believes that because of the experience, Farid has better chances to win. And he said even if it's not because of the power, but because of the technique, he can, you know, find the trick on Kory. I understand. And I would like to ask you, Alizhan,
SPEAKER_03: the match is you know do you know pauline pauline is
SPEAKER_03: What did you say, Engin? I'm sorry, you broke up a little bit. Looks like Alizhan is not following West vs. West even. Yeah, he says, Alizhan, it looks like you don't watch West vs. West competitions at all. You don't know anyone.
SPEAKER_02: I don't care about the competition, I just connect to it. I didn't even watch the AMC in Chechnya. I didn't watch it and I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: he honestly said that yeah i fell off a little bit from uh arm wrestling community but he said i'm coming back right now and i promise to follow yeah
SPEAKER_02: I support Rustam Babayev, and I think he will win without any problems. I think Rustam is stronger, more experienced, more technical. All the advantages are on Rustam's side. Maybe he will give a fight, but only in the first round.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he said that for sure Rustam Babayev will win without any problems because all the pluses on his side, strength, speed, experience, everything. But he said that Pauline is a good athlete and very possibly that he will give him a good fight maybe in the first couple of rounds. Yeah, you said that all the pluses are at Rustam's side. What does he think about the inactivity of Rustam?
SPEAKER_02: Oleg, what do you think about the fact that Rustam was inactive and is now making such a comeback only in sports? Well, yes, it will be difficult for him, but I talked to Rustam, he told me literally a month ago that he was in good shape, that he had already gained his very top form, so I think, I judge because he should not have any problems. Yes, it will be difficult for him to enter, because he probably did not fight for two years.
SPEAKER_01: yeah he said yeah he said yeah that's uh that's very maybe that uh it will be harder for him because he he was he was inactive but he talked to him about a month ago and rustam says that yeah he's uh at his peak form and uh elite form he said oh okay okay even even one month ago he said that he's at his peak so okay so we we should
SPEAKER_03: stop talking about that because the inactivity as long as you are physically ready inactivity can be a problem for someone maybe not super experienced but but someone who is super experienced i mean i mean he's not gonna be like you know where am i what am i doing he is the last guy to say that because he's super experienced yeah absolutely he wasn't active only for two years i don't think it's uh it's the biggest of the deal in the world
SPEAKER_03: it is but i don't think it's much i mean the guy is right here right here you know yeah i mean you just say put john here and then you go a little bit distance there and then you put many guys and the rustam is one of them yeah and so and uh corey west okay let me find a match that alijan would know uh yeah yeah i mean yeah we need to because uh he he doesn't talk a lot and
SPEAKER_03: Do you know Jerry Cadorette? Do you know Jerry Cadorette from Bulgaria?
SPEAKER_02: Who do you think will win? Who is stronger, will win. The winner makes the predictions.
SPEAKER_02: It's an honest fight. There are people who want to fight with their hands bent. They want to trick the opponent. I don't think it's disrespectful. The main thing is to be in the starting position. Start an honest fight so that the judges are independent. The main thing is to be honest and strong. That's the main thing in this fight.
SPEAKER_01: yeah he said that prediction is uh not his but he wish that every match will uh be fair start straight and uh he believes that any tricks uh before the start it's before the start it's disrespect to your opponent and uh he wished that every match will start straight and fair and then he wished that the strongest woman does he can he give us an example
SPEAKER_03: about that one that can he give us an example that what he's talking about before the match you know not being fair who are you talking about no he said that every match
SPEAKER_01: needs to start fair. And I am saying that, can he tell us an example that, you know, his provost is wrong? Unfair matches. Okay. Alizhan, what matches do you think were started in such an unfair position? And who do you not like to start or play some dirty games?
SPEAKER_02: Do you have any examples of such an ugly? There are all sorts of moments when a person, mainly when someone loses or something begins, that the judges are to blame for something, or the opponent. The main thing is that there was no such situation. When people start, you know your defeat.
SPEAKER_02: And to admit to the opponent that he won, that he dominates, that's the main thing. I'm not saying that there are no such people, but there are such people who fight dirty. But there were, but I can't say right now that this person fights like that. But there were moments, even at the World Championships, when they were not top athletes.
SPEAKER_02: But there are people who want to grab their fingers, they want to cheat. They push a person to a court arrest and you earn money because of it. There are such people. You can't say that there are no such people, but there are.
SPEAKER_01: yeah there is there is no particular example but he really the dislike when uh you know the uh losing parties start to find excuses and start to blame everybody around his opponent and uh you know and the organizers and uh
SPEAKER_01: referees and everybody else and uh he said that yeah he experienced a couple times when uh even at the world championship he was it was not the lead pullers but they're trying to trick something something on uh uh on the actual uh grip position and he doesn't like that when somebody trying to you know uh disrespect you that way another question can you tell him what's the picture behind him
SPEAKER_03: Oleg, do you know what picture you have behind you? Is it San Francisco? No, it's San Francisco, that's right. Oleg, who won, Jerry or Tsvetkov?
SPEAKER_02: I think Jerry Cadareti, considering his physical strength, I saw in his last fight with Kvikvinia that he is very strong and can fight for a long time. He can hold on for 5 minutes, but he can hold on. I think he will win. Maybe not all rounds, but in the end he will win.
SPEAKER_01: yeah uh oleg says that uh he really thinks that jerry will win he will he been watching him closely for the last matches and he said it was gonna be quick finish he proved that he's very very strong and he has a endurance and he can hold uh hold up pretty long maybe not five minutes he said but a few minutes will be enough and he said maybe he will not win all the rounds but uh overall he will win i understand yeah and
SPEAKER_02: Alizhan, Mindaugas, Tarasaitis, Nurdaulet Aydar Khan. So, Mindaugas, I used to fight him in the world. He had a very good top. I think I lost to him then, or won. I don't remember whether I won or lost. It was a long time ago, five years ago. But I remember that he was good.
SPEAKER_02: He has a good top. He does a good job. And Nur Davlet Aydar Khan is also a good athlete.
SPEAKER_02: I think he won in small categories. He hasn't been able to win in recent years. I think he lost in the last World Cup. I didn't follow him in the World Cup, to be honest. I can't remember. I think he didn't win. Who do you think is better between the two of them? Or he won. Maybe I'm wrong. The second one.
SPEAKER_02: I know it's going to be a good fight. I know. But in any case, we're rooting for our own. But we also wish both of us to perform well, to fight to the fullest. But I think it's going to be an interesting fight.
SPEAKER_01: yeah he knows both athletes and he's been pulling uh uh with uh uh he said it's it's gonna be a tough one is that we're for sure rooting for our uh you know land man and uh uh nur dalet but he said it's it's gonna be a uh beautiful beautiful uh very very good match yeah very cool and you oleg
SPEAKER_03: Oleg, do you know Nurdaulet Aydar? I asked him another match. He knows it? He doesn't know much, right? He knows, but not really much. He's been watching him a couple of times. Okay, and then I will ask him, does he know Curtis Cameron's workshop?
SPEAKER_02: Do you know Curtis Cameron, a Canadian porkchop? I know he will fight, but I don't know. I will ask him, Corey West and Arif Ertem. Arif Ertem and Corey West. Oleg, do you know them? What do you think? Yes, I know. I think it's Corey West.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he said that he doesn't know them personally very well, but he's been watching them and he knows approximately how the styles looks like and he thinks that Cody West in this one have edge.
SPEAKER_03: And let me ask Alizhan, Gabriela, Barbora, 90 kilo champion, super heavyweight champion, Slovakia or Brazil? Slovakia and Brazil, Barbora and Gabriela.
SPEAKER_02: I remember her for a long time. She's very strong. I think she even beats men in Brazil. But she's also not bad. Yes, that's why they gave her a super match.
SPEAKER_02: There will be a lot of interesting competitions here. Who do you think will win? Do you have an opinion on this?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, but I think Vasconcelos. I think so. She was so strong. I was right next to her. Okay, yeah, I'm sorry. I did push him a little bit to get an answer. And yeah, he thinks that Gabriela will win. Gabriela. And you, Petrenko? Oleg, what do you say?
SPEAKER_01: okay yeah he said yeah he said that barbara looks very powerful and here is so i've been watching her winning a world championship and he said that yeah i think that she will win barbara
SPEAKER_03: and probably they don't know craig julius um yep yeah i know here that's in you know yeah you know but they they i i bet they don't i bet yeah yeah they are they are tell them tell them that i said they are
SPEAKER_01: Super arm wrestlers, but not super fans of arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not a fan anymore, I'm a spectator, not a spectator.
SPEAKER_02: Last year I went to the World Cup. I was a fan. I cheered for everyone. When I perform, I don't talk to anyone. I focus on my performance.
SPEAKER_01: yeah alizhan says yeah you're about right because he said when we are participating in an event as athletes he said my program doesn't work as a fun program i concentrated on my you know matches and stuff i don't care about anything else and he said last year when i went to a world championship as a fan yeah that was you know that was yeah i've been
SPEAKER_01: rooting for everybody i've been having a lot of fun when i'm participating for 30 years i competed and i also follow
SPEAKER_01: worked together well but probably not with everyone yeah i want i want to tell you something that you uh it's not a compliment it's just the truth that you probably the best fan i know the best arm wrestling fan i know personally and i've been serious paulo if you would know me 20 years ago 15 years ago 25 years ago uh you would just witness something like 10 times more than this
SPEAKER_03: I would tell you like everything, everything, like what, what people did there, not only the results, but how they win after match, how they behave, you know, like everything I would tell you. But after that, I get older also had a family and the tires with the life and, you know, so.
SPEAKER_03: still trying to push you know last two years you don't look tired from the life you're so excited about this versus west i am dying every night i go back my brain hurts i said i think tomorrow morning i want to wake up
SPEAKER_03: every morning I wake up with incredible pain and I say like oh it's not gonna go like that you know it really hurts my brain because not only like this like you need to do the hotels you need to do the airplane tickets you need to do the stage and the camera and then you need to do those issues to cover the event and I mean a lot of things you do all the promotion and then the this
SPEAKER_01: interviews, a lot of things, you know, like countless things, you know. Anyway, so let's go. I think, I'm sorry, I will comment it very short. I think right now, yes, you're taking care of everything, everything, but I think it's going to change soon.
SPEAKER_03: and you can delegate part of it and i really want to see you doing your job you're you're perfect at setting up the super matches and you know this is yours and you will have trust me trust me not everyone has the same passion you understand i really need to put my brain into it you understand you just also my relationship with the athletes and everything you know it came to this this point because like i am one of them you know
SPEAKER_03: to many of them like their older brother you know yeah anyway so let's go to do it yourself you know yeah let's go to john berzing and iraqis let's start with oleg petrenko one second uh iraqli said that iraq we said john
SPEAKER_02: You beat Oleg Petrenko, but he says, I'm not Oleg Petrenko. So let's start from there. Irakli says, yes, John, you beat Oleg Petrenko, but I'm not Oleg Petrenko. Well, yes, he's not Oleg Petrenko. I don't doubt his strength. I've been watching him for a long time. He's very strong. I...
SPEAKER_02: I don't just root for John, I root for him because even though I lost to him, we had a very good relationship. I respected him, he's a legend, I was equal to him. I fought with John, I understood how strong he was in some situations. I could never imagine that this could happen.
SPEAKER_02: I talked to a lot of people, they talked to me. You talked to me last time. I have already recognized myself. So I think John will win. But it will also be a very difficult fight, both for Irati and for John. I don't think it will be a quick fight. It will be a very difficult, long, emotional fight. Because two athletes are very strong.
SPEAKER_02: John is more experienced, Irakli is more experienced, and it will be a game that I want to see as a spectator. Interesting. And then we'll talk about Irakli. Engin, give me one second, I'll translate a little bit to Russian, just summarize. Well, Alizhan, for you and for everyone who speaks Russian,
SPEAKER_01: So he says, I support John. He himself actually saw how strong John was in some positions. He says, well, yes, Irakli, of course, this is not Oleg Petrenko, he says, and I respect Irakli, he says, and I follow him, he is a very strong athlete. He says that the fight will not be easy for both athletes, there will be an emotional, tense, beautiful fight, but still, he says, I think that John Brzenk will win.
SPEAKER_01: now english uh summary oleg got a little excited because we've been talking about john and he said that even who lost to john they uh make a very good friendship and uh he's rooting for john
SPEAKER_01: uh and he said yes that's right iraqli is not oleg petrenko and he said i have a lot of respect to this athlete and he's very strong young athlete but he said i believe that john still will win he
SPEAKER_01: he find out how strong John in some of the positions are and he couldn't believe it because he heard from uh a lot of athletes even including me last time how strong John can be in some of the positions and he wouldn't believe it until he tried it himself and he said yeah it's gonna be a hard match uh for both athletes it's gonna be very emotional and he believes long match but John will win yeah tell him that he's
SPEAKER_01: the betrayer of Team West. I don't know what the betrayer is. He doesn't support the West, but he's supporting the West. Ah, yeah, okay. He betrays. Yeah, just tell him that, like,
SPEAKER_03: 99% of the West feel in the same way, you know. Yeah. Okay, the last thing I will ask him, and I will ask you, Alizhan, should Levan told John to stay at home? Does he agree with that?
SPEAKER_02: Alizhan, Levan told John to stay home, that he would lose to Hercules. Do you agree with that? I don't know. Maybe Levan is confident in something. Maybe he prepared him personally. Well, of course he prepared him personally. When he was my opponent, he lost, of course. But we fought on the left hand mostly.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think we've met before, to be honest. In recent years, he's been dominating on the right-hand side. He's good. Who do you think will win? Between John and Radley, who do you think will win?
SPEAKER_02: It's an interesting fight, but of course, John is an old man. He's the face of armwrestling. The face of armwrestling, one of the first and the oldest to remain. He's still the sixth tenth of a person.
SPEAKER_02: And he's holding on to the youth. He's a very powerful and strong man at the moment. There aren't many people like him left now. Who will win? Who will win? Do you think there's a chance? Or is it just a matter of weight? I'll hold on to that answer. Of course, I support both of them.
SPEAKER_01: I was trying to help you and I was trying to pull push Alizhan but he said no I will stay on mine and he said that chances are equal and I'm rooting for a good
SPEAKER_01: good pulling and uh he very very respectful to john because of uh how long he's been on very top and he said on uh almost six decade of his life uh he is still pulling with the best athletes in the world so yeah that's the question in fact was to to uh oleg if john should stay at home and listen to uh leon
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah. And Aljan also said that Levan probably knows something because he said so, because he probably been preparing Irakli himself. Yeah, sure. Oleg, what would you say? Comment on what Levan said. John, stay home. Stay home, John. I think Levan is Irakli's friend, as far as I know. That's why he said so. Well, maybe.
SPEAKER_02: He prepared him very well, but I don't think he can beat John. John has a very strong opponent in his career. John will find a key to Irakli.
SPEAKER_01: uh yeah uh he said uh well yeah levan knows something because he probably prepared luckily very well but he said uh and iraqli friends of a friend of levan that's why he said so but he said john will find the key and you cannot impress john with anything basically because he was with those years in arm wrestling he saw everything and everybody in all different styles and all elite uh pullers in the world
SPEAKER_03: okay i understand the the one knows everything about iraqi but he may not know about john because i believe they did not pull yes absolutely yeah that's interesting before before we go to the uh the last match which will be michael todd and ongar i would like i said last match because the others
SPEAKER_03: obviously they don't know even if they know one guy they don't know the other guy so when you don't know both of them very well it's hard to predict you know so that is why i mean no need to really give them difficulty you know so that that is um so i would like to ask them like like for example alicia it's like since he's coming to beat oleg petrenko he believes that he's the best
SPEAKER_03: guy in 105 kg does he think that you know he can be the best in 115 kg or even does he have any dream to be the absolute champion of the world of course he won the love but winning love sometimes doesn't really prove that you can beat everyone in the world so that's what like you understand my point right yes absolutely yeah
SPEAKER_01: Alizhan, I have a question for you. You are coming here now and you will compete in the 105th category. So you are sure that you will win in 105 kg and you are the best with your left hand. I have a question for you. Do you also think that you can be the best with your left hand in 115 kg or even in super heavy weight, in professionals? Well...
SPEAKER_02: everything is possible everything is possible but everything can be discussed what kind of time for preparation about interests i ingin knows that i didn't refuse anyone he offered so i can with anyone
SPEAKER_02: It depends on the time, the preparation, the interest of the attacker. It's normal.
SPEAKER_01: uh okay uh alizhan sensor was uh yeah listen uh it's uh uh all depends on the time of preparation and he said and he knows i i never said no to anybody uh and uh yeah i'm ready to uh supermatch pretty much anybody but it's very much depends on uh prep time and for sure yeah yeah yeah i understand
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's ask the same question to Oleg. Like, if Oleg wins this, who does he want the next? Is there anyone on his mind that I would like to pull this guy? Or no? Oleg, if you win this fight, do you want someone next? Do you have someone in your head that you really want to fight?
SPEAKER_02: On the left or on the right in general? I think on the left, but now on the left. Well, I need to win the Sambarad. I'd like... I'd like Dadikyan. David Dadikyan. He's interesting to me. I'd like to fight myself. On the right, a rematch with John. Well, it's in me.
SPEAKER_01: I believe in myself that I can do it. It will be hard. I would like to do it in the future. Me too. I will tell you now. So, yes. Alizhan, you need to translate something. David you hear it clearly or not?
SPEAKER_01: First of all, I need to win this supermatch.
SPEAKER_01: And then, yes, very interesting, David Dedican left. Very interesting. And right, he said, I want to match revenge with John.
SPEAKER_01: nobody nobody is gonna give the revenge match with john before he's beating some others i i know and that's why i started laughing because yeah i want him i want to pull john too you know everybody wants to pull john yes a little bit uh
SPEAKER_02: Okay, I understand. I like this sportive principle. It will be honest. I'm just waiting for an invitation to a fight. I'm ready to prove that I can do it again. Okay. Say something in Russian. You need to translate.
SPEAKER_01: uh yeah he said yeah absolutely i understand uh that i have to you know go the full sporting circle and i like this uh i like this uh uh this setup that i have to win everybody else and again hit the john and i'm ready and i'm waiting for invitations
SPEAKER_03: okay yeah yeah yeah i mean you know this is not to translate for them you know but do you follow like that is driving me crazy like i want to keep these guys all of them busy almost every event you understand my point paulo absolutely it is driving me crazy these guys are the best guys super guys and they want to pull and i need to
SPEAKER_03: When I do 16 matches that I'm not complaining. This is the reality. I don't get enough support to continue. Understand? Because people, majority wants to see this guy, this guy and that guy. I will have to organize those. Plus I will do as much as possible in 10 matches. Do you know what it means? How are you gonna give chances for all these people? You cannot.
SPEAKER_03: i know i know sorry sorry but i failed that's what it is that's what it is i i wanted it but i don't have power you understand it's nobody's fault we are just not ready when i say this oh how are we not ready i mean i don't want to talk about it but you are not ready you know that's what it is you know
SPEAKER_03: this guy is waiting for an offer right and then the other guy is waiting there are 16 measures here but there are a lot of people are waiting over
SPEAKER_01: okay you go ahead and fit them in 10 matches go ahead uh you know what uh i if you don't mind my comment here i love those two guys because they are not pushing anything they giving us a fair uh and uh you know opinion and they are humble and they are saying engine we waiting for invites we will wait are you ready who
SPEAKER_03: both of them pretty much all of them they're not pushing they say we're waiting you're talking about these guys right no no i'm not talking about them my friend i of course they are not pushing but but i know how they feel you understand why you're not calling me i've been waiting for you i am for 30 years more than 30 years in this sport whatever they feel i feel it i felt it for like decades i know how they feel not only that many people are messaging me
SPEAKER_03: So how are you going to set them? You can't. You can't. We are not that big yet. And then I feel bad. You know, this is what it is. I'm just sharing from the heart, just because we are like a big family. I'm just sharing with you, sharing with the people that we are all together here. That's all, you know. Anyway, so let's go to the last match. Michael Todd, Ongarbaev, Alizhan. Alizhan, Michael Todd, Ongarbaev.
SPEAKER_03: Well, right now I have to say for sure who will win. Ongarbaev will win. That would be great. Ongarbaev will win. Is Ongarbaev going to win? Ongarbaev is going to win. Yeah, but does he not think that, you know, Michael's open-arm style is dangerous? Do you think Michael's open-arm style is dangerous?
SPEAKER_02: And give me the questions. Not everyone can do this. Not everyone can do this. Kings move? Kings move, yeah. No press, yeah. Well, probably not. Yeah, yeah. It's very traumatic. It's scary. It's hard to look at him. And we root for our guys.
SPEAKER_01: they're rooting for kazakh guy but yeah he said that it's very very uh dangerous and uh uh dangerous positions and dangerous styles inshallah you are saying we will stay we will stay and oleg how do you see this match my friends
SPEAKER_02: I will fight for Ongarbaev, but I think that the victory will be for Michael Todd. Because I think that Ongarbaev will probably reach the first round, the second, but then he will be dependent. And this is the end of Michael Todd's victory. This will be a difficult fight, and I think it will be difficult to predict.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Oleg says that... Hold on a second, Russian first, I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_01: He will cheer for Ongarbaev, but he thinks that Michael will still win. He says that the first or second round, perhaps, Ongarbaev will reach him to the pillow, but then this Michael's Kings move will still wind him up and then Michael will win the whole fight.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, English. He said that he will be rooting for Ongarbaev, but he thinks that Michael will win. He said that maybe first one or two rounds Ongarbaev will push him to the pad, but the King's move will suck up the endurance from Ongarbaev, and overall Michael will win the Supermatch.
SPEAKER_01: and he said that the engine you did such a good job that matching up those pairs that it's very hard to predict very hard they are so close that it's very hard to predict any of those i understand and and and then and
SPEAKER_03: um i think is there any anything that they would like to add can you ask uh alijan alijan like does he see this invitation as one time event for him or is he planning to come here often it is important for him you know yeah
SPEAKER_01: Olezhan, yes, he asks you or wants to add something, he also asks whether you assess this invitation as a one-off or you are building some plans and hope for the continuation and that this is important for you and you also plan to participate in the West-West competition in the future. Yes, of course. The main thing for us now is to go and see the first fight.
SPEAKER_02: It depends on whether we win or lose. We will work with Ingin. We will fight to the very end.
SPEAKER_01: okay uh yeah he said absolutely very important and uh he said uh we'll see we'll see after this match but he said it i hope it doesn't matter if i will lose or win that we will uh we'll be working together for a long time and we will be uh pulling uh all the way to the end until the east finally will be the west
SPEAKER_03: What's that? Until West will finally win the West. Okay, okay. But tell him that if he cannot pass 105 kilos, there is no offer for him for 115 and super. Next offer will be for 95. Without passing 105, no 115 for him.
SPEAKER_01: Alizhan says that if you don't win 105, then you definitely won't get an offer for 115, but you will get an offer for 95. So you have to win. Of course.
SPEAKER_02: if you want to add anything before we finish the the program this is very close you know like a few days later they will be here you know i want to say that i like the east west tournament i would like to fight for it i like the organization and the selection of participants
SPEAKER_02: All top athletes want to fight there and they are already fighting there. So it's a prestigious fight for me. I would like to win first and then fight and win titles. Thank you to the West West team, to Elvin.
SPEAKER_01: yeah he said that uh he likes this versus west very much uh he likes how you pair and set up the super matches and he said it's very prestige uh for uh all the elite pullers to pull at east versus fest and he said that uh he will uh he wants to win and he wants to continue winning titles and uh he want to pull on your events and he said very thank you very much team east versus fest
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, thank you. Yeah, after West versus West 5, he said it was completely recharged me as an athlete. And he said, yeah, brand new, wants to train again and wants to move forward.
SPEAKER_02: What did he learn after West-West 5? I learned a lot from my fight with John. It's an invaluable experience.
SPEAKER_02: In such fights, you grow as an athlete and as a person mentally. So I'm happy with my trip and the past. I hope this will be even better.
SPEAKER_01: uh yeah he said that this was a priceless experience uh with john brzenk uh best experience in his life i guess and he said that uh uh very satisfied with everything uh a very good experience learning experience and he said that this versus west six uh he hope it's gonna be even better than that yeah and please tell them that i respect both athletes very much very much
