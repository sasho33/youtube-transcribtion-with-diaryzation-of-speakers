SPEAKER_00: Yep, I'm back. Hello, Gabriela. Hi, Engin. How are you? Good, good. And you? I'm good, too. How are you? Let me delete this live from the one that I set. How do you connect Zoom meeting to YouTube live?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, how do I connect to YouTube? Yeah. I set the Zoom chat, and after that, at the bottom corner, there are, like it says, more, like three or four dots, and then you click there, and then it gives you option for YouTube. And then, but I think it needs to be a professional Zoom, you understand? Not the regular one. Yeah, I do. Yeah, and then you go there, you connect, and then you come back to Zoom, and then, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So how have you been? How's everything? Yeah, how have you been? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, everything is good. I, I honestly think I okay, so as far as my preparation goes, I would really love to be slightly better as
SPEAKER_02: as far as like injury wise, like I have this elbow bothering me, but I'm pretty strong and I'll just have to be able to control that pain, like in certain movements that comes and then I think I should be fine. But yeah, it gets in the way of the training. So my confidence,
SPEAKER_02: It isn't 100%, but I know based on how strong I am, the exercise that I've been doing, that I'm just as strong as I was a couple or like a few months ago. So you are saying that basically your power is there, but about your joint, you have some concerns? Yeah, exactly. You need a little bit more collagen and a little bit more rest.
SPEAKER_02: maybe last two weeks more like light blood pumping you know and then good warm up this weekend i'll have like my last table practice because that's when he hurts the most the most and then i'll obviously start a continued training but not more like have super heavy training and then press the week the week of the match and and hopefully everything will be fine like
SPEAKER_02: Because even since I restarted training, I haven't taken any time off. So although it hurts, I don't even know how I'm going to be feeling when I rest like a full week. And I really respond well to this resting week. So I'm also betting a lot on that. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you have been training nonstop for years and years, you know, trust me.
SPEAKER_01: sometimes uh little extra rest doesn't take anything away opposite way it heals up all the injuries you know you are still very young to like recover you know you are even though your titles are like more than your age they're the same actually now it feels weird like people like how you're 34 and now you have like
SPEAKER_01: almost 28 titles at senior class. And then if you add up the junior classes, it's 34 titles. We don't have the juniors and masters together at the same time. To the chat, I would like to say that Barbora will not be with us. She got ill.
SPEAKER_01: and she didn't feel well she said she needs to rest and so gabriella will be alone with us today and so we can talk about the the question you said that you are not 100 confident uh were you 100 confident when you pulled egglet yeah i was you were wow interesting
SPEAKER_01: You were confident about your shape or you were confident about winning? Because sometimes you're confident about my shape. I mean, I can't be any better than this. I'm confident, but I don't know if it is enough for my opponent or not. So your lack of confidence right now, is it about your own shape or about your victory? Yeah. Okay. So there is this difference. And when I pulled Eglet, I was 100% confident on my shape.
SPEAKER_02: and knowing that i did the best i could to prepare myself and the result of the match would be consequences of it like i i wouldn't feel bad if i lost because i knew i had done everything i could so most of my confidence uh going to a match comes from that comes from what i could do during my preparation
SPEAKER_02: so right now it it's because of my my own condition like my own shape but i never know if i'm gonna win or not i just want i just feel it like i feel that i want to bed or that i i'm prepared for it but i never know i never like
SPEAKER_02: I mean, obviously, I get the feedback from my training partners and they keep saying, I don't think there's a woman that can beat you because you're too strong. They're struggling with me sometimes. And then I say, but people, listen, there have been. And I know that there will be. I don't know when and I don't know who, but I never... We don't know if there will be or not, but there may be.
SPEAKER_01: because unless you meet someone that is stronger you don't know about that one but but you are a proven one that you know just as of now you are the best in the world and another question i wanted to ask you um if you win this one or if you win or not this one there is no way barbara to make 80 kilo
SPEAKER_01: But if you want it, you could make it. But you're going to continue with your open weight category title or you want to do shot both sides, you know, like Aiden? I would like to shot both sides, yeah. Both sides. So how? It doesn't sound like very, how to say, it doesn't sound like, how to say, right.
SPEAKER_01: because you already have two wins in a row against Sarah. But just imagine if Sarah and Egle, because Egle was light, 83, 84 kilos. If they pull for the title of 80 kilos, but you beat Egle recently, but you were about a little bit heavier than her. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So would you also go against the winner of that match? Because I'm planning to set that match. Well, I would if I could. Yeah, I would. Because honestly, I don't feel well with that weight that I am now. And I'm struggling to manage to get back to 80. But I've planned on it for this year. It doesn't...
SPEAKER_02: doesn't matter. Like, I'll have to cut back to 80 because I don't feel well, my body doesn't respond as well. It's like, I'm short, I shouldn't be weighing that much. So in many aspects, it doesn't look good on me. And I don't want it. But probably like right after this match, I'll start cutting again slowly and trying to go back to 80
SPEAKER_01: because there are there will be three weight categories for the east versus west 70 80 and open and now you are you are uh planning to have uh titles with uh like four of them right right and left yeah that would be good yeah if i could i definitely would like that would be much of a harder like uh challenge but
SPEAKER_01: good one we should i will tell you something the life is boring if you are good and still playing safe you understand life life life is great when you are good and then you're pushing your limits there there there there there you know like like trying to get like just if you're not gonna break different records you know just like you understand it's boring like i feel that now like
SPEAKER_02: current situation they are more uh like they're better athletes under 80 kilo class like um there are more options of good good athletes and then of over like the ones that are very good over like they're like i don't know three maybe and then they're like
SPEAKER_02: almost 10 very good ones at 80 that we could match up together so that would be interesting because there are different styles they can be lighter but faster and with different techniques so and it's been a while since i pulled them all so that would be very nice yes yes yes yeah yeah yeah it is good that you know you push your borders and do things that nobody has done before
SPEAKER_01: then then then it's good motivation other than that you just go there compete win i mean i know it's incredible success but if you can do more than that why not why not yes the other day i don't know i asked are you coming back she said no yeah oh my god everyone is
SPEAKER_01: bothering her that i think it's just respect respect that you know if i am knocking her door and asking hey you change your mind it i wouldn't do that to everyone you know the another one that i did to arsene lillier and so this is only because they are good you understand yeah so i feel like like more like a sign of gratefulness
SPEAKER_01: That we did not forget about you anytime you think about it, you are more than welcome to honor us, you know that that is my not to bother anyone. But she doesn't feel at all like it right. No, I mean she said that you know, like while.
SPEAKER_01: Gabriela is enjoying, you know, why would I make her unhappy? Just let her enjoy. And she never said that. She never said that. No, no, no. Yeah, no, she didn't say that. Yeah. Anyway, so let's talk about you wanted to pull right. Let's go about your opponents.
SPEAKER_01: First time it was, it was, it was 2021 after the championship, there was ceremony. And then I asked you, you were like, Hmm, you know, let me think, not sure. And then you went and you come back. Yeah, I'm ready. You know, you said, and yeah, I sometimes, uh, I can doubt myself, but I just,
SPEAKER_02: i just thought to myself like well if i wanted back then to be the best why would i refuse any opponent i i don't like i i can't afford it i can't choose who i want to pull if i want to be the best so so then i i second thought that and i i realized that if that's what it takes then then i would have to to do it and and
SPEAKER_01: I should have taken back then because now it just seems like she's gotten better and better. And listen, a year later, she will be even more dangerous. I know. You know, right? Yeah. And the question, in your opinion, is she going to be tougher than your previous challenge? I think that
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if strength wise, like, I don't know if she's stronger than Angle or stronger than me, but she is definitely going to be tougher on the setup or the strategy or like we, we are so different size wise. Right. It's like, I don't, it's, I don't know who it's going to have to adapt most the most to, to be able to, for us to pull each other because she's super tall.
SPEAKER_02: I'm super short, my hands super small, and then she has that in her advantage. But then my arms are shorter, so you have to kind of give in a little bit. So I don't know. It's not going to feel comfortable for any of us, I believe, because we are very different in height. And then that would be the most difficult part, like to be able to get in a better position
SPEAKER_02: the same time i'm used to training with big guys so i never train with women and i never train with anyone my size so i'm kind of used to it but not competing against someone that big i don't know it's going to be very hard but i think that egla is stronger like in pure strength like i think that
SPEAKER_02: i can have a big advantage on that matter against barbara it's just a matter of if i'll be able to apply it based on like her size and her hand and how we set up i think yeah she is over 185 something and she is over 120 kilo and she is
SPEAKER_02: like soon yeah so i'm used to looking at her at worlds and seeing her and passing through her and i say hi to her and all that but then i took a picture with her last worlds and then i looked at the picture and i
SPEAKER_02: I didn't think like in my head, I didn't realize how big she was because she was like kind of bending and still like so taller than me and bigger. And her arms were like the size of my almost whole body. I don't know, like her, her arms. How did you feel her hand? How did you feel her hand when you grab her? Well, it was just a soft grip, but her hand is big, like she covers all my hands. So that's the hard part, I believe, because
SPEAKER_02: um my hands are strong but small and her hands i think they're not as stronger as strong as mine but they are like much bigger so maybe she wouldn't have to be like as strong as mine to be able to control my hand but i'll try like um
SPEAKER_01: not saying everything she has um the way that she's using her hand wrist i mean very high quality you know just yeah usually you see the female arm masters more like finger like this you know while she's just you know i mean and she's very tall um i i don't know i don't know how they match and i know you have incredible side pressure and we will see we will see um
SPEAKER_02: don't know where where do you see your chances you um how do you see her like how do you rate her inside side outside how do you see her well i i don't well i don't have much of videos much because of many videos of her falling but based on what i've seen she usually falls uh very
SPEAKER_02: very good and fast top roll like she she does it very well and i haven't seen her pulling inside not that i remember of and there's this one video right after europeans 21 that she's pulling against what yeah yeah yeah no i saw i saw a video with her is the left arm in hook no
SPEAKER_02: really yeah that's interesting i didn't see that one i'll look for it but um she seems like i don't know she doesn't she seems to have like less control of what the movement when she on straps she she seemed pretty even with english off straps and then they strapped up and then eggly was very dominant
SPEAKER_02: We're talking about almost one and a half year ago, a little bit less than one and a half years. Yeah. Since then, well, I don't know how much Egle has changed since then. I don't think it's too much because we were talking right after we pulled about our training and all that.
SPEAKER_02: but uh we can clearly see that barbara is evolving like she's getting better she's uh improving her style and i i think that would be logical to me that she would try to top roll me and use her height and weight in advantage like if i was her i would do that but i don't know how is her strength in other positions and i haven't
SPEAKER_02: i don't remember that if i've seen her like struggling in different positions to see how she would react she seems like to win pretty easy so i don't really know how um how she get off uh bad situations or what she is 22 years old yeah i think yeah i think she turns 23 this year 22 years old yeah
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no. I think she turns 24. How do you see the percentages? How do you see your winning percentage against her, honestly? I think it's more than 50%. That's for sure. Yours? Yeah. Okay, that's good. That's confidence. Well, I think that my experience, my knowledge, and my strength would have to count
SPEAKER_02: to be more than 50% because we all know that arm wrestling is not just about strength, right? So I wanted to use this 22 years of experience in my advantage and also super match experience. I've been learning a lot. It's completely different than tournament
SPEAKER_02: and i i don't know if she has done anything like that before not at that level and it will will be i i think that would count also in my favor there is a possibility to meet a freakish power on human power it is and then like i'll just have to
SPEAKER_01: But you also have the same thing. You also have the same thing. Your power is also inhuman, you know, just for a woman, it's just incredible. Yeah. The only thing is that if she is the same kind of freak as you are, when I say freak, don't take it as a disrespect because you are incredibly strong for a woman. So it was more meant in a positive way.
SPEAKER_01: so i don't know if i should use this for a woman or not so that's why i got it okay so don't get me wrong um but if she is the same type you know same type of alien as you are and and she's also bigger much bigger yeah i think that i'm guessing minimum 30 kilo difference between you and her
SPEAKER_01: and some people may think the difference is only because of she being like maybe overweight or something she's not she's thick she's yeah she's strong muscular you know she's yeah she is yeah yeah she's um so what i'm just saying that if if she is a weird person as you are like incredible power
SPEAKER_02: And then there may be a surprise. Do you expect such thing? Yeah. I think that if she's like just as strong as me, then we'll be 50% each because, uh, again, I'll have to believe that my experience and my many years of doing that before her will count in my favor and, um,
SPEAKER_02: And that's something similar that what happened to Egle. I think that out of straps, we had different kind of strain. But at the end, it was kind of similar. We were trying to apply different things, and the mesh wasn't going anywhere.
SPEAKER_02: Joiri Minaya- easy for any of us, but then on straps, I was able to apply my strength better, so I use what I what I knew better against her and it went well I don't know that is that plan plan or do against Barbora but i'm.
SPEAKER_02: saying that if she's as strong as me i'll probably have to do something that will count in my favor that she won't be like she'll have to learn how to defend herself because she's been doing that way less than i have and i i really want to believe that this is going to be in my favor so i think that my chances are a little bit more than 50 percent yeah some some people are asking
SPEAKER_01: if you felt SARA or EGLI stronger, but to be fair, when you pull SARA, you were at same weight while you were around 10 kilo heavier than EGLI. Is that correct? Yeah, I was 80 kilo when I put SARA like this. Yeah. It was the same exact weight while there was around 10 kilo difference between you and EGLI. So if you consider
SPEAKER_01: by ignoring the weight difference? And if you also consider the weight difference, how would you judge your matches against these two super strong female pullers? I think Igla is stronger a bit. Yeah, she is. Well, because I, I
SPEAKER_02: put on weight, I trained harder and I trained a lot for, I mean, for, um, for Egle and with Sarah, I was cutting weight and I was obviously training hard, but I still was. It makes difference, right? When, when you cut all that weight, it makes some difference with your power, right? Yeah. It does. And also another thing that your match against Sarah,
SPEAKER_02: uh mostly uh started to be difficult in ladies rounds right yes that's yeah because i i dehydrated and i uh to cut weight i dehydrated like i don't know three kilos the night before our weigh-ins and i didn't eat properly so i think that count in the like count against me because i
SPEAKER_02: I was super tired after, I don't know how, what round was that? But at the beginning I felt pretty confident and I felt like safe in almost every angle. So even like, if I didn't have being that tired by the end of it, I think it would be much easier than it was with Eglin because. I mean, Eglin gave you trouble.
SPEAKER_01: like not so long time, but right from the start, she had better start. And then you stop her and then you, but with Sarah, but I think that where Sarah made mistake was that Sarah tried this all the time. In my opinion, if I was Sarah's coach, I would tell her to load right from the beginning and make your hand tired.
SPEAKER_02: right from the beginning instead though in the late rounds you know because yeah i think that like i think she only did that because i started to feel my hand like tired then she felt it and then like she was then loading more which got way harder for me and as i said eglet was hard from the beginning and i didn't get tired with eglet
SPEAKER_02: but i had to adjust and and i didn't feel comfortable at all like in any moment but um with sarah uh i don't know the first three or four matches i don't know how many matches we had to to like i think is the one that you stuck your arm wasn't going but your hand was taken but your arm was still holding yeah
SPEAKER_02: yes but like two i don't know i i followed out and then i didn't fall out i i had like two or three two like false starts and then we didn't have like four matches we had like 10 matches because daniel was following her and then we went on yeah but then there was the false starts and then on her
SPEAKER_02: then on me and then uh we had like a real fall and then start over and then after that and then rap street or stress so like that the whole thing of like the gripping thing the gripping part was very exhausting and then with eggly we didn't uh have that because it was more strict rules and it was it was harder because
SPEAKER_02: she was like kind of more prepared to pull against me i don't know if that's the word but she made me more uncomfortable from the beginning while sarah it took a while for me to tie her down and then she figured out the best way to pull against me so i would say in a match against each other eglia would win but it would be very interesting because they are both really strong so
SPEAKER_02: I think it would be more like they may have better hand control, maybe even better start, but, uh, Sarah may have stronger arm may have more, more like arm power, you know, maybe. Yeah. And Sarah, she could like come back from like, from a losing start because she does have a lot of endurance. Like she doesn't feel that she's gassing out too much.
SPEAKER_01: As I said, you know, if she tried all those loading and false starts right from the beginning to the outside to your hand instead of your arm, because more she did that, you just flashed, you know. Because, I mean, you are so strong to dive in there while your arm power, side pressure is so strong. I think it is more clever to, you know, target your hand, you know. So, I don't know. We will see. But I think that Sara versus Egle would be another amazing match, you know.
SPEAKER_01: yeah i think so yeah and then you you would try to take your title yeah i would you want to you want to go direction let them pull first and then at that time you would be going down 80 and then then you would say okay i'm ready yeah well yeah i'll be ready as soon as i get the scale to hit 80 kilograms i'll be ready because
SPEAKER_02: That would be very nice. My motivation mostly comes from competing, from challenging myself. So if I had this goal set in my mind, if it goes down to 80, and then they will have their match before that, and then you're ready to do the next.
SPEAKER_01: just come in because i mean i'll be ready you you recently have wins against both of them so it is better them to pull and then yeah yeah yeah yeah it would be good let's see let's see let's see how it will be and you and barbara very soon oh 18 days 18 days around this time you you you ladies will be
SPEAKER_01: pulling against each other. I know. And Neil Pickup will go, ladies and gentlemen, he will go and then, here we go, Neil will say. Is it Neil? Yeah. I love him. Yeah, that would be nice. Yeah. If Neil is announcing, it's just affecting your performance by 5% extra. Is that true? Yeah, well, you get
SPEAKER_02: you you believe that what he's saying like he makes you believe yourself it's good and it's good because he says it from like he really knows what he's saying like he's not just reading like some statistic he knows he's been there most of the time so he he knows your story and then yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it does like get you yeah it's super nice he's not only an answer but he's also he's an authority
SPEAKER_01: for the sport. And yeah, he has ability to speak well, announce well, and analyze well. And analyzing about the knowledge, but there is also historical knowledge. He also has that one too. So I think he is the best at what he is doing for sure, without any doubt. And anyway, so if we talk about some other matches,
SPEAKER_01: but you'll be careful we have we have jerry cutter at match yeah i'm not betting against him ever yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but okay so i i i think i think he betted against you i had i had a podcast with him and i i said you you you sport in gabriella because she's from west right team west she's like he's like no i'm i'm betting
SPEAKER_02: even i don't know the girl but i'm betting against the other girl this is revenge time i'll have to redeem myself jerry i'm 100 sure you're gonna win but okay in my defense i must say that i got all my picks wrong last time i i chose all the wrong winners so that that
SPEAKER_02: should count like i'm a terrible picker i i don't know who who i should bet so not against him just because i i chose everyone wrong the only match that i got right was mine so don't don't take my right was yours anyway so so let's go let's go some of the guys you may not know yeah and
SPEAKER_01: um okay let's start from uh douglas rich you know him yes from wal he also pulled yeah he's pulling with uh raymond's liapins coach ray and yeah i i'm glad that you know you know the one of the reason uh that you know well because you are english speaking more you are more involved with the western athletes you know on social media
SPEAKER_01: But at the same time, you have been competing waffles forever. So you know all the Eastern guys from here, and you know all the Western guys from there. You also have some WAL history. So you know everyone.
SPEAKER_02: Not everyone, but more. I don't know. I'm probably going to get this wrong too, but I know them. I know who they are. And even if I have never talked to them, but I know who they are. Probably because of social media or other tournaments that we've been together. But if when it comes to choosing who is going to win, I'm not good. Never know. It was one time. This time you're going to predict everything.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, correct. Okay, let's see. So who's winning? Doug or Coach Ray? I'm going to go with Coach Ray because I have... Because he will be doing commentary in your match so he can say good things about you. I'm joking, joking. Yeah, that too. No, because I haven't seen much of Doug recently. I don't know. Coach Ray has been very active
SPEAKER_02: he's been improving and challenging himself. He had like, he had West versus West arm wars and Latvian nationals, like all recent, even worlds where he didn't do that good, but like it counts as experience. Well, so I don't, I don't remember his last match. So that's why. He was, he was pulling the same event, uh, that you were against, uh, uh, Ryan Bowen.
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah, no yeah I don't remember those last match. Oh okay okay okay. Anyways, Cobra Rose is in the chat, the legendary Cobra Rose. He says Deng in number one. Cobra Rose is number one, Cobra. And Cobra is one of the friends who will host the qualification for the Eastern Susquehanna. Yeah, I've heard it in January. People are complaining in chat, they are saying,
SPEAKER_01: how the hell the West versus West qualification is not in Brazil, but Bolivia, they are asking and they are crying. They're crying. Yeah. He put that thing, you know, those, those. Okay. Well, because I had already had, have this tournament planned and I,
SPEAKER_02: I think, well, I've, I've done one in Brazil. I've done actually two others in Brazil, like last year and the year before. And this year I wanted to change to give like, because the tournaments here in Brazil are, are a little better than the ones in the other countries of South America. So I was planning on taking good quality events and good athletes to other countries and.
SPEAKER_02: mix them together and then also like the other time i'll bring it back to brazil and like not focus only in brazil but like to mix and match so that's why but who knows maybe next year like when uh we have another either like my tournament only or if it's always first best qualifier i'll probably do again in brazil and and that's how it's gonna go
SPEAKER_01: By the way, you recently got married. And once again, congratulations. Thank you. I know that you two have been very happy together. But now in a marriage, I wish you guys a very happy and healthy life.
SPEAKER_02: um i really appreciate it thank you yeah we were just like officializing our already marriage lifestyle because we've been together like for 10 years almost like gonna be 10 years in april and we had planned to get married before pandemics and then with kobe that things got in the way and then
SPEAKER_01: if it just was founded but it's just like to to make it official like we already have like a married life anyway somebody's asking why barbara is not here barbara doesn't feel good she feels uh ill and she said that um like she said can we do that next weekend and i i read this message in last moment so we already announced so i thought that it would be
SPEAKER_01: not good for the fans who are waiting. So we decided to do that with Gabriela. Anyway, so okay, let's go to the next one. Porkchop versus Zurab. I shouldn't call it porkchop, it's Curtis's camera. Yeah, okay. That's a hard one because they are very, I think they have a similar style.
SPEAKER_02: and workshop i mean i don't know him i just recently uh like heard about him he pulled against he pulled against was it krasimir uh he had a tournament in canada
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, in Canada, Krasimir pulled against Matt Mask. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. So I don't know. I think it was that question. Next one. Korim West versus Ferit Osmanlı. Left arm. Wow, that's a good one. Left arm. You know Ferit. I...
SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure, but I'll go with Corey West. Corey West, yeah. Yeah. Okay, then Genadi Kvikvinia versus Ferit, right hand, this one.
SPEAKER_02: If you don't have an idea, you can say it that way. Farid, I don't know. You don't have to say something, you know. It's hard. If you think it's close or something. I'm trying to remember their styles of fooling. And then I can't imagine, like, because they're both big. They're both, like, been to WAF. They have, like, control of the rules. And I don't know. I can't remember Farid last match. And then Genadi was against Jerry. He lost. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I think I'll go with Genadi. Okay. Genadi is the last time I pick on you. You know Robert Baxter? Yes. Robert Baxter had a final match at WAF in Grand Masters against a Turkish guy, Ahmet Yenerer. And the year before, Robert won. And this year,
SPEAKER_02: Ahmet won. And so they are going to pull also at West versus West. That's nice. I, I, I gripped up with him when I went to Bob Brown's tournament. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's super strong. Like I obviously was not okay. Like I wasn't feeling well, my arm was hurting, but, uh, super, super strong. Like,
SPEAKER_02: I don't think I knew how strong Grandmasters were. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so I... Well, if it's going to be 50-50, they each won one time. So, like, whoever won last time might have a slightly advantage. Yeah, but, you know, whenever it's tournaments, hard to say. The draw plays big factor if the guys are close to each other about level.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And let's go another one. Mindaugas Tarasaitis versus Nurdaulet Aidarkhan. Nurdaulet is the one from Kazakhstan that won against Daniel Prokopchuk in the final 75 kilo of final in Antalya. I'll go with him then. In the same category Mindaugas took fifth or something, but
SPEAKER_01: Mingdago and Daniel met and Mingdago toppled Daniel. It was a tough match, long match, and Daniel won. So it also affected, you know, the performance, but I don't know if it affected the final result. Yeah, I think that guy from Kazakhstan, I remember
SPEAKER_01: their finals, it was, he was like best. Yeah. And Daniel even tried to catch him. Yeah. But yeah, he, he followed, right. He followed up because he was trying to like winning, winning, you know, it was a sleeping losing position as far as I remember. Yeah. Yeah. But now it's different than, you know, I mean, that was, is a top role master and the other guy can pull cause that guy inside, outside in all ways.
SPEAKER_01: But lately we see him outside pulling. So we will see, you know, how that will happen. But today I read that, I read that Minda said that he's going to beat him badly. Beat Nordalen badly. And he said that, you know. I love Minda's confidence. He always like this. Yeah. Yeah. You remember my, how we were teasing each other before our match? I remember. Yeah. Right. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's Oh, I have to say, I remember also that he said that he was going to destroy me. I normally use from each one. Yeah, I know. And then he later sent me a message congratulating me saying that I was must I must be very strong. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Because she said, I know how his English is strong, so you must be really strong. Congratulations. I mean, you can be sure, Minde, that you cannot even touch my hand. You should tell him. You should tell him that he couldn't do anything against you, just to tease him. That guy looks skinny, but he's very strong. Trust me. Very, very strong. I know. I mean, all the Kazakhs, they don't look as strong as they are. No, I'm talking about .
SPEAKER_02: skinny. The other guy is more muscular. Compared to the other Kazakhs, Nur Dalet looks more muscular. You will see there. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I know because Mindaugas, he was like, he was at the after full table there at Worlds. He was like beating everyone. I was watching him. He was beating everyone there. So I know that he doesn't look that strong, but he's pretty strong. And also at his
SPEAKER_02: last match i didn't like it that much because they were all like just kind of giving up so they wouldn't get tired yeah a phone call came after phone call comes and then i put it to you know busy and but then the sound
SPEAKER_01: went away a little bit so let me try to fix that hello hello yeah let me try one second sometimes when i um can you talk i can't let me yeah is it better can you hear me um barely can you hear me
SPEAKER_01: just one second i get out here and then you accept me back okay to the chat
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Can you hear me now? Yes, yes. And can you move? I think since you're the moderator, you move and make it like you were alone. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay. We were talking about me Douglas, then let's talk about this one is tough to talk to. I made you the host again. So often, the host of the meeting.
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't matter. We're going to finish. I don't know what you want. It's okay. Yeah. Okay. He left Iron Angel alone. Who does that? Neil Kikab is asking. Who does it, Neil? You know. Who does it is Angry Turk. Angry Turk. Enigma Rage. I was on YouTube. I was just here looking at a camera.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, did you talk bad about me after I left, Gabriela? I didn't, I can't see YouTube. What? I can't see the YouTube thing. No, I'm just saying, have you talked bad about me after I left? I did, no. Everyone is saying that you said very bad things about me after I left. No, not at all. You're lying, right? Yeah, okay. Obviously, I wouldn't do that. Yeah, I know, I know, I know, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Anyways, I'm joking. Let's go to the next one. Alizhan Muratov, Oleg Petrenko, left arm. Who is the first one? Alizhan Muratov, the guy, the Kazakh guy, 95 kilos, the one with left arm. Oh, yeah. Do you remember him? I do. You're a small guy.
SPEAKER_02: yeah he was like why did he do that he didn't have a spot on the team or do you know why he didn't for his weight class okay he didn't compete the kazakhstan nationals ah and the superhero weight was the only open spot so he just competed there and yeah he won yeah yeah yeah i'll go with him then
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but you know the other guy as well, Oleg Petrenko? Yeah, the guy who last fought with John Brzenk, right? John Brzenk, right arm, and Zurab with left arm. He also has wins against David Dadikian. He won the Zlotys, the last Zlotys he won against David Dadikian with left arm. So his left arm is also very strong, yeah. Yeah. Okay, so you are saying Ali Can is going to win. And then Corey West versus Arif Ertem.
SPEAKER_01: This is right arm, right? This what? This is right arm? Right arm, yeah. Because left arm he will do with Ferit for reverse. I'll go with Arif Ertem. You go with him? Yeah. Okay. And do you know David Arabuli? No. You don't know?
SPEAKER_01: he's going to pull against chance. He's a training partner of Irakli and Levan. And he, three years ago, he was around Sandiris level, as far as I remember. But now, he hasn't been active. So I don't exactly know how good he is. And we will see. You don't know the other guy. It's hard for you to compare. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But I also. Lately Chance is helping about the tournament organizing. So you're going to go with Chance, right? Well, yeah, for him. Oh, my God. Some people were just nonsense on Internet. And I think that. I think he's well, he proved me wrong because I picked her up against him. Oh.
SPEAKER_02: uh and he beat him pretty easy so i'm gonna go with him until he throws me wrong again i understand and craig craig tuller versus david samusha okay uh that's hard one but i think david samusha although i would want it practically to win
SPEAKER_01: okay you support craig but you are thinking that david may be stronger exactly i understand yeah anyway so now is very interesting match we are about the end last three four matches and um there is also another match 110 kilo
SPEAKER_01: uh left arm winner at the last walls if you remember sundry swan we thought sundries won the gold and then they checked the cameras you know the kazakh the kazakh guy is gonna pull effe effe and effe is very good left time effe took third place in the same category effe in fact is the one that sent the kazakh guy to b site but it was with fouls you know but effe probably had a better position
SPEAKER_01: and then he came and he because uh later so these two are gonna pull but uh probably looking bigger now isn't he or yeah i mean if he's competing at wafi 110 kilo if he's not competing he's around 115 kilo you know okay yeah and the east versus west category is 115. uh yeah yeah um i'll go with the other guy
SPEAKER_01: because okay because he wanted okay well yeah okay like the information i'm going with it now now the last if you want uh you will have much more uh knowledge about judge and you know all of them let's start with rushtan baba versus pauline that is i'll go with pauline with the heart and my or mind
SPEAKER_02: I think both. Both? Yeah. Because Ruskan has been inactive or you are extremely impressed by Paul's latest performance? A bit of both because Paul is coming like very strong and proving himself over and over like surprising. I don't know if it's really surprising but like
SPEAKER_02: every match he like he proves that he is isn't there by mistake and rustam hasn't been active although he's very strong but like i think this experience that paul has gained like from the last event
SPEAKER_02: being active and being training and healthy will count in his favor. It won't be easy though. I think Rustam is very strong and smart, but being inactive, although you're always training, I don't know how much he's been training, but not competing, it does change your mindset, your body response. So I think Paul has the advantage there.
SPEAKER_02: And let's go another one. Michael Todd versus Ongar B. I knew this was going to come. Okay. You support Michael for sure. I know that. Yeah, I do. And I think it's just like I haven't seen him that light, right, in years. It's going to be 105.
SPEAKER_02: But I'm going to go with Michael Tan because I think he'll definitely have to stop on Ongarbaev's heat and make his way back. I think he has enough endurance to do it. And King's move hasn't been bad positions anymore. So he's getting stronger.
SPEAKER_02: is defending in a better position so i think he'll he'll come back it's not it's always going to be like that like he turning his wrist and and holding the heat and then coming back from the match i think that's going to be how yeah yeah and but on that way was also with a dangerous guy i know yeah and we've seen that his last match with
SPEAKER_02: John and how easy he won worlds. But I think. I think. Like in a supermatch. Michael would have advantage. I don't think he would. I don't know. I don't know if you would like win a tournament if they both were in the same class. But I think this supermatch Michael can have the endurance in his side.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's go. John Bersink versus Irakli. I would never bet against John. Is it because of your respect and love for him? Or is it because he's still very, very dangerous? All of it. All of it, okay. Yeah, I mean, his last match against... I forgot the name of it.
SPEAKER_01: like yeah that was impressive yeah that was really impressive because in that that when you i can say that most of the people we thought that petrinkle was gonna be john and we thought it was gonna be badly that is how we thought after we see petrinkle's shape yeah but as you said you know it's hard to best bet against john you know
SPEAKER_02: guy is incredible yeah and then like uh he i don't know what he does because it seems not i mean it's not you can see that it's not easy but i it i love seeing how he like how much uh heart he has like he gives it all at the table and then like
SPEAKER_02: also it's so like i can't imagine being there but i was watching and i was like i i i don't know how he feels like all the energy that comes from the audience rooting for him like no one cares about the other guy like we want the other guy to give him trouble just so he could win and everyone be happy about it like i i can't imagine feeling that so i think that
SPEAKER_02: He also gets that from whenever he's in a competition like that, everyone cheering him on and it must be amazing. I think that he wouldn't keep challenging himself if he didn't feel ready for it. He's been competing, I don't know, nonstop for three years. I don't know how many years, but every time it's harder. Yeah, since he got back.
SPEAKER_01: Who? John Brzenk, yeah. Yeah, I mean, he came back about one and a half year ago. Can you imagine? He did all these matches in the last one and a half years. Before that, there was like, what, six years break. I know. All these matches that you see happen in one and a half years. And the guy is just teaching the world, the young guy, that you don't have to wait like six months to pull, you know. He's teaching everyone. He is, and...
SPEAKER_02: and every time like it just seems that he never stopped he doesn't i think like his out of all these matches that he he's pulled in the last one and a half year i think his worst shape or performance was against like he had like losses but uh he was like small or he was just coming back
SPEAKER_02: But I think like the last ones, and he wasn't feeling well that day, I know that too. So after losing to Ongarbaev and coming back to a length like he did, I think was pretty impressive. So I think he'll just surprise us again. What do you mean surprise us again? You will be surprised if John wins.
SPEAKER_02: no not surprised like surprise no no no no very good performance yeah gabriella said that she will be very surprised if you win i said that he's gonna surprise us in a way of giving a show a performance that no one
SPEAKER_02: forgets easily because I mean, we all know that he is the best, but every time he pulls, we are reminded why, because he does something very impressive. We just, oh, that's why he's the gold because he just did that. And no one was expecting him to do that, not win or lose. He just has so much knowledge at the table that
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm just teasing. You don't need to explain yourself. You can say surprise. Yeah, yeah. But Irakli is also a very dangerous guy. I know. And Saganash really just said on the live stream, he suggested John to stay at home and not to show up in Istanbul. He told him not to come to Istanbul. Well, yeah. Let Irakli
SPEAKER_01: say that after. Yeah, you're a guy. Anyway, so let's go to the last match. This is for the super heavyweight title. Jerry calories. Of course, you're not gonna bet against him. This time, he's not gonna forgive you. And against Georgi sweat go. And Georgi, do you follow his pictures as well? He's also in incredible shape. He said,
SPEAKER_01: a week before Christo went to train him and then this week I think Samushia and Bojidar and I think next week I think Krasimir is gonna go to train with him so he's training with all the top Bulgarian guys they're giving him training and he said he is in incredible shape let's see how the match will be majority of the people are thinking that Jerry is gonna win because of his uh pulling style yeah while
SPEAKER_02: Sam says Georgi is going to win, but first tell us how you really feel, and then you can say your political answer. No, no, I really feel like, I think it's going to end in a flop press freeze from Jerry and in a long match because the guy from Bulgaria, I forgot his name, he's a top roller, right?
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah i mean he's the current world champion i know yeah i know i know him i just i'm just thinking that i'm just remembering styles and i think like since he top rolls jerry's gonna block bruce and then hold him there and tire him out that's how you are saying yeah so i think jerry's gonna win uh i have to pick jerry yeah but i would have to even like
SPEAKER_02: i do think he's gonna win because i i thought that i think that if there were a match okay so if there were a match with georgie and gennady i would think gennady was gonna win i don't know why i'm saying that so you are saying gennady would be georgie yeah okay i don't know why
SPEAKER_01: That's why I don't need the matches. Wait for those matches to come. You don't need to unnecessarily put yourself in trouble. When those time comes, you can do the prediction then. Anyway, so... I have plenty of matches to get myself in trouble and I'm creating other ones. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so... Gabriela, you have anything to add? Any message to Barbora?
SPEAKER_01: any other thing that you want to say you want to say something to barbara do like do you have are you like can you challenge her like say that barbara i mean stay at home no need to come here or something okay i'm just gonna take get one thing okay you're gonna bring your shield
SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry, I'm moving my neck all the time. It's because of the neck pain. So if you win, this is going to be the second time with the same arm. Yeah. And then you need to defend it three times so it will permanently be yours. What do you want to say? Yeah, to have the helmet too, right? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And this time we're gonna give you also a medallion. Every time someone wins a title match, we give permanently medallion. But it needs to be a title match win. But for the helmet and shield, you need to win three times and then it's permanently yours. Now shield helmet stays in Istanbul, you take shield. Next match you bring shield. When you do that three times, both of them are yours.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not even unpacking this. That's what I was going to say. Oh, you are not even packing. I'm not even bringing it. According to the rules, I think you need to present. I'm kidding. I'm packing it, but I'm not unpacking it. So it's going to be in the bottom of my suitcase. Yeah, but did you know that you're going to come on the stage with that?
SPEAKER_01: Ah, okay, so I'm unpacking it. See, you already can't be behind your word. How are you going to be behind your word when you pull her? No, no, I'm just here showing. First, you're not going to bring it. Second, you say you're bringing, but you're not unpacking. And now, anyways, yeah. I forgot there are rules. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just wanted that to be at home. Yeah, yeah. I'm a troublemaker. I do that all the time. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: okay but other than that um for barbara that's all i have to say this belongs to brazil but you are not gonna tell her that you know she is young she will get over you know not to worry and these kind of things did i do you know the reason i am saying i am trying to make you say these things so she can she can get motivated
SPEAKER_02: and then like next to you know there's like gabriella set that and then all over internet i i yeah see internet is talking about not the levon and hermes but you and yeah barbara yeah that would be good that would be good that would actually be awesome well not only me but women's and wrestling in general but what i want to say actually for real now is that i want to first of
SPEAKER_02: Thank you for having like these events every three, four months. Like it's getting like us athletes to have new perspectives, new public, new motivation, new goals. And even like being around so many legends make us really proud of just being invited to one of your events.
SPEAKER_02: and so thank you for that thank you also for um i keep telling people how big of a shortcut you gave everyone by making those qualifiers like i don't i don't think people understand like how like how not strict but like you are very like critical with who you picture events
SPEAKER_02: in a good way like you have to be like the athletes must prove themselves in different tournaments before being like fixed to an event like that where all the best are together so it's i say it's a shortcut in so many ways because it's cheaper because you don't have to travel to i don't know how many world championships it's easier because
SPEAKER_02: uh for the west team especially it's always been like trying to prove themselves against europeans and now like they don't have to first do that and then be invited to one of your events and having like qualifiers in all the americas also it's going to help a lot of people who well can't afford going to the us or can
SPEAKER_02: be everywhere like for me to every time i have to to pay out of my pocket to be in tournaments where i wanna where i think people will see me and then after doing that for so many years i got some attention but other than just go to a tournament i have to also win and prove yourself and be convincing right
SPEAKER_02: and i think the world should be so thankful for you to you by doing that and having like great partners around where you trust them to put your events names on their tournaments and and i think for that like everything is going to get bigger faster and and much bigger because it's not just
SPEAKER_02: you having to be like watching everything that happens around the world all the time but like we kind of picking the best and then you look at it and then you make your choices i don't know like we are selecting pre-selecting for you and i think the world should be grateful for it and i am because i know that this is a great shortcut for everyone
SPEAKER_01: and would be awesome for everyone to have. Gabriela, because of my respect, I didn't want to cut, but I normally don't like to hear that many positive words. I want to say I gave my life to this sport, and I love this sport, and I owe this sport, and I don't think our sport is where it deserves to be.
SPEAKER_01: And I don't think that you superstars or arm wrestling are at where you deserve to be. So that is my intention. That is a scream out, you know, that, you know, for many years that I kept in me that when people ignored us, oh, arm wrestling, you know, that, that, that I, it was a big pain. I buried in my heart, you know, now I have the opportunity to this sport and to serve this sport. And then,
SPEAKER_01: you guys support me in the community to support me. So I will go as far as it goes, you understand? Because this is not where we deserve to be. So, and another thing, yes, this event needs to cover itself. That is why, I mean, there are super matches. I cannot invite 500 people, a thousand people like WAF, you understand? Even there, everyone comes with their own expenses. So there needs to be selected, you understand, people. But I don't want,
SPEAKER_01: east versus west to look from outside like something unreachable elite we can't we can never be there no you can be there but of course i cannot invite all of you so here is your opportunity if you really think that you are good enough it is your opportunity i mean if you don't think you are not good enough and then then don't expect to be on that stage you know
SPEAKER_01: but i still feel very limited because i do the qualification in europe i did in america but still asia still uh that the the new zealand australia part still africa this this should not be uh forgotten so i need to find a way so that
SPEAKER_01: This is for the unification of the arm wrestling world. This is how I see it. Because many years it was divided that, you know, some guys pulling the over here east professionally, some in America. But we are only one world. We are not like two different planets. So we should be pulling against each other. The win and losing is not the main thing. The main thing is to make the humanity together in the sport that we love, you understand, to unite us.
SPEAKER_01: yeah exactly i i thank you and superstars like you the others as much as you thank me because if this this what happens here is great it is because of you guys presence that you know that makes everything great and i think everything is good i think we all are grateful to each other i'm grateful to the fans i'm grateful to
SPEAKER_01: you guys and then you guys show gratefulness that that is my motivation because otherwise people don't understand my motivation is so much depending on the emotional reasons that you understand like i i wouldn't do this if i did i wouldn't like it after this age i'm so tired but i see that people and you know go ahead you know we are with you and then i'm okay i cannot stop i need to go you understand yeah you cannot stop
SPEAKER_01: no no no i mean yeah yeah but as long as we all we all like what we are doing we all support each other and of course we are gonna go we have one main goal that to bring our support support to where it deserves to be you know this is our main goal yeah yeah anyway last but not least i will also want to say to everyone to buy the paper i think like that's the way we i mean it doesn't um
SPEAKER_02: of course whatever we say oh we are thankful for that we appreciate your work we do but if we don't buy a pay-per-view then we you can you cannot uh continue to do that because you need that to to cover everything that costs to make an event like that so yeah i want i would want people but some people cannot approach
SPEAKER_01: You understand? I have seen somebody wrote, Engin, I mean, I am financially not doing good, but I will push myself to buy paper. I told him, please don't buy, you know, because, I mean, it is not the most important thing in the life. If you have easy life, not easy, but if you have easy time to afford that, yes, I understand. But I would not want anyone to, because this much of money in the sum of the world is not so big.
SPEAKER_01: while some of the world, it means much more than what it means to someone else. So, I mean, I believe that everyone who can afford, they are supporting. And the people who cannot afford, I understand them. And I also respect them just because they don't have money, they cannot afford. To me, they are not any less than any other people. It's because they don't have power to do this. So it's okay. Yeah, we are a big family, but thank you for supporting again.
SPEAKER_01: You all the time you know you're you are in the cart or not you always support you always share and pay per view, so I don't think that I I don't notice that I noticed that, and you are very good professional yeah Thank you, thank you. yeah I mean, I think. Well, I am like.
SPEAKER_02: being good or not, I'm grateful for whatever you're doing for the greats of the sport. So I think if, well, for me, $15 isn't little money. In Brazil, it's a lot of money. So I can't afford all of them, but I'm trying my best to support in the ways I can.
SPEAKER_01: and i sure can come together five guys can come together all together exactly and i i've done that too yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you your your camera uh the the audio yeah yeah that was awesome yeah that what i heard yesterday i'm not gonna say the names but i heard somebody else told me that these are one is world champion athlete the other one is medalist and
SPEAKER_01: they are talking already making plan what to buy to eat while watching West versus West. And this is almost 20 days away and that I like it, you know, what to do, you know, West versus West day, you know, what to buy, should be what, you know, it is, I like it. That's what I wanted to do. Like a day, like an arm wrestling festival, you know, just like all the superstars, you just sit down with friends or whatever,
SPEAKER_02: maybe even even on a big screen and just enjoy yeah yeah we deserve that i've done that here in brazil so like every time there's a there's like an event like that we've had practice watching it like the first east first west we planned uh a training at the i don't know where it was and then there was other ones that we went to my friend's house and then we bought food and

SPEAKER_02: someone who understands the sport and then professional that can take like very good pictures, especially like now that you have the athletes cards, you're going to be very good. Yeah. And do you want me to tell you your stats already? You want me to? Do I have already? Yeah. Hook, three. Topple, two and a half. Side pressure, one.

I sent him, you know, on the WhatsApp, I sent him like two, three, four, you know, like... Oh, yeah, I saw that. Yeah, you saw that, right? Yeah. Yeah. You know, I kind of like to tease the younger generation, you understand? They see me like older brother.
SPEAKER_01: and like they respect me we we joke a lot you know like people should have seen you know whenever i and hermes chat or we we do some kind of negotiation about the upcoming match if people would see that they would die from laughing trust me they like the way that we are doing i mean it's very funny even we left like crazy you know just the guy is just so
