SPEAKER_01: Okay, so let's start.
SPEAKER_04: I was listening that he's asking, how is the training going? How is it? And how is it? I was going to say, hey, listen, I'm the moderator. Yeah, that looks like we really want to know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You tell them that they will find out soon. I guess they know by themselves. Soon, soon you're going to say. OK, who is the translator?
SPEAKER_04: Me? No, you will translate. My name is Alibek. Alibek? Yeah, I have translated. Yes. Alibek. Nice to meet you, Alibek. Me too. So let's start. Many, many people don't even realize how big this match is because all... I'm not talking about everyone, but many of them are thinking that
SPEAKER_04: the bigger the guys are, the best is the arm wrestling. But, you know, we know that people who knows arm wrestling knows that that's not the fact. So for me, this is a bread-cutting match. And soon, maybe whenever I'm telling these things, you can also, you're translating it? Yeah, yeah. I'm translating. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and this is a very, very important match. And Minda Agos, let's start with you.
SPEAKER_04: Uh, how do you feel and your performance? Uh, we know that at the WAF, uh, you know, it's tournaments, you know, it's not like fresh versus fresh super match, but it is, you, you have a draw. And I, as far as I remember you and Dania, uh, the, uh, dog fight, you know, uh, top match and you ended up with fifth or sixth, right? Six, I think. Six. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So you're finishing the placement at WAF. And before this match, did it make any kind of problem with your confidence? Well, in this case, first of all, let me just say that I'm happy that, you know, I have an opportunity to fight Nord-Oled and then we can also now interact a little bit because
SPEAKER_02: The whole Kazakhstan team is just we are always so respectful, so respectful to me, at least. So I'm very happy with that. But also it's like difficult to communicate with them because the language barrier, my Russian is also not great. So I'm happy that we have this conversation. Maybe I can get some insight from Nudolet and I can understand what what he thinks about the match. Yeah. Yeah. And me myself.
SPEAKER_02: i'm normally very confident and i'm still confident now but um i don't feel like i'm at the level where i could just simply say that i'm better than everyone i'm still at the level where we are somehow all close everyone is close to each other there are a few guys in that category that is close to i mean everyone is but yes anything can happen i cannot just say yeah so i cannot state that i'm gonna beat him uh no problem right
SPEAKER_04: at the same time um i know that uh i didn't feel great during buff event um i feel i feel like i could do a lot better yeah but listen listen sorry for cutting you but during during your match with uh danielle your performance wasn't bad at that time and i kind of felt correct me if i'm wrong that match could be longer but you felt like okay there's no need to get
SPEAKER_02: more tired than this like you just let it go i'm not saying you could win but you could make it longer am i wrong about that or oh yeah i think i i think i kind of stopped at the moment where in my mind i felt like i'm not gonna win it most likely so there's no point anymore right yeah yeah that's how it looked yeah i can try harder but i felt like no not worth it so and then i still managed to visit later on so it is what it is but um
SPEAKER_02: I feel like a supermatch format will help me a lot because Nord Oled is a very speedy guy. I have more endurance. I can try to slow him down a little bit better. And also, I don't feel like Nord Oled is...
SPEAKER_02: Nudolev is not like Daniel. I don't consider him being my biggest nightmare. I don't think he will be able to press without his wrist efficiently. So I think he's forced to attack me in this probably like a top roll way. Quite a quick, of course, top roll, but there's a lot of side pressure, but not... But, you know, whenever someone is attacking me in a top roll way, it's somehow...
SPEAKER_02: i'm feeling okay i'm feeling confident i don't feel like um do you find his outside skill better than daniel's yes i do it's because of his explosiveness as well right and maybe maybe his hand and wrist is also better could be a bit better yeah and the explosiveness for sure but when i think when i think about it i just um mostly mostly i'm happy that he's not floppers pressing and i'm happy that he's not um
SPEAKER_02: shooting inside like Talgat, right? Two things which are maybe the most annoying. I'm not gonna have to deal with them here. And then of course, still very versatile, very strong opponent, but I feel like I have a pretty good chance to deal with all his... You are saying that he is versatile, but his skills are divided.
SPEAKER_04: not like one specialism like talgat does only very sharp inside so he is like like talgat is hundred percent old inside that move while uh he is like 70 outside maybe 30 inside you know type of uh yeah so you don't know no extreme powers in any area
SPEAKER_04: no of course quite extreme compared compared to many other athletes in the world but i feel like i can have a pretty good chance to do that yeah yeah yeah and if we if we talk to uh nordalet uh nordalet you are uh people don't know much about you but you are already one of the most successful pullers in the history um i and hajimura zole we won of course in five different categories
SPEAKER_04: while you won 55, 60, 65, and you took second at 70, and then you won 75. So you already got medal at five different weight categories, with four goals and one silver. So if you win even 80 kg, someday you will be winning goals in five different categories, and you will have a plus
SPEAKER_04: a silver medal in 70 kilo which is the sixth category so people don't know much about you but you are such a young guy already as far as i remember in 2015 you were only a junior puller when you won the senior gold in in malaysia as far as i remember 55 kilo so you must be like maybe 26 how old is he 26 maybe
SPEAKER_04: He was 25. 25. Yeah, he's such a young guy and already accomplished all this. And I would like to ask him, how does he see his chances against Mindaugas? We know that Nurdalet is very well-rounded puller. He can pull in hook and the sideway and top row.
SPEAKER_04: and we know that he's also very explosive and during the match he can be also very good with his stamina also and but as far as i know he doesn't have very good super match experience does he think that this may be disadvantage for him or not
SPEAKER_01: Nowadays, I'm training very hard versus Mindaos. We also know that Mindaos is the top sportsman in the world.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to say that this match will happen and this match is going to be the best match of the day, I think. Yeah, but how does he see his chances? Does he see his chances? Is he confident? And about the super match that he doesn't have experience,
SPEAKER_01: Does he think this is disadvantage for him? I'm very confident. God will give us the will in this match. And I'm training so hard.
SPEAKER_01: And did he say any comment about the super match? He doesn't have experience. He is usually tournament-type of bowler. Also, super match. How is he losing?
SPEAKER_01: Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_01: uh yes uh this is the first time um when i uh include in the super match and the five rounds with the opponent it's very hard uh but i'm training and the training to win and and i'm training uh especially the patient the patient
SPEAKER_01: and yeah save the energy uh okay so i didn't understand that part is he training for endurance or more explosiveness so that he will save his power um
SPEAKER_01: First, I'm going to do my best to expose and to wait with the speed. But if it won't happen, I'm going to be patient till the end. He will be ready for any kind of scenario. Yeah, I understand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: and yeah and uh can you also ask him how how important is this match for him to to to pull a professional world title at the east versus west stage it's very important much for me
SPEAKER_01: All the trainers and all the fans support me to win this match and they support me a lot. I have to do all my best.
SPEAKER_04: And basically he says that he's going to kick me in the ass. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and then you are also extremely respectful tonight, unlike your Facebook comment. I can simply say, I can just simply repeat my Facebook comment. I was trying to say that Nur DoÄŸulet will lose like a bird. At the moment, he is flying very, very high in the sky. He won't laugh and he will just crash down to the ground very hard.
SPEAKER_04: In the schools in the door. So was it. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_04: The table will show us. The table will show us. See, these kind of comments are just putting some gas on the fire for Nur Dalet, as far as I understand. These kind of guys don't talk, but the more you talk, the more they just feel themselves. And then when the name is announced, Nur Dalet Aydar Khan versus Mindag Astar Aziz, he goes like, who? You know?
SPEAKER_04: but it's like it's not affecting them at all so maybe there's no point to talk you think it's not affecting him i i don't know it seems like it's not it no you are not going to see the effect here you're going to see the effect where we are yeah on the right time you know this is what i believe yeah yeah yeah what what does he think about all these talks
SPEAKER_01: Does it affect him? What kind of effect does it cause on him? I've never heard in the see these comments or hear something else. I'm just training. Oh, OK.
SPEAKER_04: Good discipline and respect. But I can translate inside it. I'm writing everything down, and I will make you pay the prize on the competition day. This is what exactly I translate. Anyway, so, Nurdale, what is the percentage of chance you give to yourself to win?
SPEAKER_01: Of course, if we were able to do it, we would be able to do it ourselves. Of course, if we were able to do it ourselves, we would be able to do it ourselves. Of course, if we were able to do it ourselves, we would be able to do it ourselves. Of course, if we were able to do it ourselves, we would be able to do it ourselves. Of course, if we were able to do it ourselves, we would be able to do it ourselves. Of course, if we were able to do it ourselves, we would be able to do it ourselves. Of course, if we were able to do it ourselves, we would be able to do it ourselves. Of course, if we were able to do it ourselves, we would be able to do it ourselves.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to try to do my best, and the Mindaos is the best one in the world. And I just want to say that the table will show.
SPEAKER_01: i don't want to say the percent or prediction of this much uh because all my teammates and the coaches uh supports me and i will do my best i i don't know what exactly will happen but yeah uh this is only god knows whatever is written that is going to happen this is what he says destiny yeah yeah and yeah see the guy is super respect
SPEAKER_04: And he also calls you one of the best for sure. And it is such a, how to say, such a respectable opponent, Minda Agas. Of course, he's going to do his work. He's going to try to fulfill his dreams while you will try to do yours. And it's a good opportunity for both of you. And anything you want to add, Minda Agas?
SPEAKER_02: It's of course, you know, at the end of the day, uh, I'm glad to pull someone who is, um, clearly very respectful, has some good values. And, uh, I'm actually also the same. I have so much of respect to all of these Kazakhstan coolers. Um, you know, sometimes we try to have some fun because it's still a game just to, to enjoy life and, you know, have fun. So, but, uh, at the end of the day, I know this respect to. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: um world champion and um i'm just very glad to that i have a chance to check myself against someone from shardara from that amazing club and um probably is the best club in the world in my opinion it looks like it yeah just so many champions are coming out of that club so and uh i do feel like like once again i have a pretty good chance um these days i'm just working on bringing my best shape in
SPEAKER_02: Because I feel like if I am successful in bringing my best shape, which I'm on track of on doing, I feel like I have a very high chance, maybe 90% chance to win. I just need to make sure that I don't make any mistakes in the preparation those couple of weeks now, and it should be very good. So I think that basically you are thinking, in my opinion, that you are more specialist
SPEAKER_04: about what you are doing. And you are saying that if you can do what you do without mistake, you know, your chances higher. But there is another thing that your opponent is also very explosive, very explosive guy. And sometimes he can put you in a bad position. Just my opinion. I'm not saying but where he is attacking, to me to hook you is
SPEAKER_04: very few people, very few people like Bojidar, you know, and yeah, yeah. But other than that, very, very hard. So and but still, if somebody needs to beat you, either he needs to be like a dead risk or like, like, still joint like Dania, or a specialist outside, I say that, like, it needs to be super fast, explosive,
SPEAKER_04: Because still in slow motion, slow moment, you will do like better than. I feel like I should. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It needs to be very explosive. And in my opinion, Nurdale, maybe, maybe a little bit faster than you. Maybe. Just a little bit. Yeah, maybe a little bit faster than you. You are also very fast, especially you're like positioning very fast.
SPEAKER_04: but the guy is also lightning fast, you know? So it is not, I don't know how to like, listen, this kind of things, it is almost impossible to know. You know, you have a guy moving this way, the other guy is moving this way. Whenever they hit each other, you do not know who is his head. You're talking about a few percent, you know, power difference, you know, it handles your scores or it doesn't handle, you take his risk. Like, it's just like hard to calculate already, you know?
SPEAKER_04: you can know the possibilities, but you can never measure the power. Also, it is up to the form or at that moment, also performance, you know, so it is like many people, they are like, Oh, I can, I guess this so easily. Like, for example, easier than engine predict, I predicted right away. I mean, to predict a winner is 50% chance in this.
SPEAKER_04: even if i would ask someone outside on the street is even he doesn't have armrest he doesn't know the name yeah yeah i said the lithuanian guy wins or the kazakh guy wins his chance of predicting is 50 you know i mean like and but important is to know all the possibilities but again what i know doesn't allow me to say that this guy is gonna win you know but you to give yourself 90 chance is it
SPEAKER_02: intimidation or is it your honest feeling just actual actual feeling let me also say one more thing um nordola just mentioned that he's working a little bit on the endurance right in my mind that's immediately maybe a good thing for me because if he's just a little bit focused on endurance it may take away a little bit from his speed right uh which again
SPEAKER_02: If the speed is less extreme, then it might be easier to catch it. But it totally depends on the position.
SPEAKER_04: like your endurance in this position your endurance is this position your endurance is this position this i mean you know we talk about the okay the match stops the guy has better interest but where the match stop you know where what position that much match may stop somewhere that you may be getting exhausted you may not have a good endurance in this position right yeah yeah yeah you may get exhausted before that but if you have the better position he will be spending more and you will be exhausting you know so we don't know about this thing it's just like if you want to
SPEAKER_04: just write down about arm wrestling possibilities or pages pages we need to write we need to talk but you would lose your mind you know if you know it and i'm sure you know it i'm i know it but whenever you try to express it it's just like it's much harder than thinking here you know anyway so it is good and can you ask uh nur dalet uh what does he think about we know that the uh
SPEAKER_04: 2021 WAF was in Romania and it was the last time Russian pullers were allowed to compete and they were the top two finishers. Alain Zolev and Artur Makaro, they had the final. I checked, it was more than two minutes. They had three matches and it was more than three minutes total. Total was three minutes active pulling. But these two were
SPEAKER_04: one head above the rest like these two were just like one head above from the third fourth fifth you know they were in their own league you know so can you ask um will it um when they come back to compete with you guys um does he think that the the how to say
SPEAKER_04: the competition will be much harder than how it is now. Um, like, or in, in another way, like if just say Alan Zola would come and then pull the winner of you guys, like, does he feel ready for him as well? If he beats me, that was, uh,
SPEAKER_01: You're going to say that? Your question is, sorry. My question is, if Alain Jollet, for example, invited to pull the winner of Mindaugas and Nurdalet, and if Nurdalet wins against Mindaugas, does he also feel ready
SPEAKER_04: to pull someone like Zolev or he sees himself, I mean, he sees Zolev even less tougher than Mindaugas or tougher than Mindaugas, how does he see?
SPEAKER_01: I hope that after the winning $1,000, I'm ready for everyone, for Alan and other guys.
SPEAKER_04: Artur Makaro, Alan Zolev, Emil, you know, so he feels himself to prove himself that, like, without any limits for any other country, he is like, I want to be the best 75, best lightweight in the world. So he feels himself ready for that. Yeah, everyone. That's good that he has that spirit, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I'm happy to hear. And the same question for you. I asked you privately on WhatsApp, I said, like, if you beat Nurdalet, do you feel ready for someone like Alain Zolev? And you said, yes, Engin, I feel ready. And another question. After this one, you can answer that an additional question. If you would put Alain Zolev in the same position that Emil would put, do you feel like
SPEAKER_02: you wouldn't lose that match or hard to hard to say that good question but yeah to answer the first question um alan's love showed some very impressive results the last time he competed right so clearly there's a question can this is this guy even beatable and then um emily recently showed that maybe there is a chance
SPEAKER_04: which I was very happy to see. It gives me more hope as well. But Emil has incredible hand and wrist, maybe the best hand wrist in 75 kilos. One of the for sure, you know. Yes, for sure he does. He has like a 90 kilo level, world level hand, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but as you know, I have also a pretty special way to open hook pullers. So I feel like I can also probably do that. And then, yeah, I might have enough endurance to just outlast the rest of the fight. But yeah, I don't know. I feel like I have a chance. It would be very interesting to see what happens. So I would be happy to pull a lot.
SPEAKER_04: So you are saying that if you had that match that you top roll Alonzo there, do you think that he would also beat you like the way that he did to or you think that
SPEAKER_04: emil has maybe better hand than you are but you do you maybe think that once you topple someone it is harder because zole didn't do it like like exact joint way like daniel does he doesn't you know catch you here but he just opened bicep by like a kind of dragging you know yeah how do you like i feel like i'm maybe a puller who is a bit more defensive than emil
SPEAKER_02: And, uh, being defensive means that you are used to pulling a bit low to the bed, you know, a bit in this kind of losing position. Uh, but that also means that I'm somehow better in that position. And maybe I can, uh, maybe Alan would not be able to finish me. Right.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, the only thing that I'm asking you this question, because when you top roll someone, you are more connected. While if you realize Emily's doing some kind of like open arm top roll, so he's not really, he's like more muscle going, not so much joint elbow lock to apply the pressure. Maybe that is helping him to top roll the guy, but to finish it, like I don't see that his angle is,
SPEAKER_04: enough close to i mean you know what i mean like you know what i mean yeah yeah yeah yeah but he is incredible emily is also incredible and i'm i'm surprised i'm surprised there are like right now probably million arm wrestling fans and i and sometimes we go up to a thousand uh people live watching this now it's only 70 people watching
SPEAKER_04: I just so feel sorry for people who doesn't understand this level, this beauty, this quality that these guys are, I mean, like right here about everything, table IQ, speed, pound for pound strength, like well roundness, the smoothness of the, I mean, just, I mean, I can't say enough of good things, but the reality,
SPEAKER_04: It's not popular. It's because they don't know yet. They don't know yet. Same as was with the boxing and UFC. I give this example already. Now Mayweather, McGregor, Habib Buit already, but they had more followers and they even made more money because UFC followers came to that level to understand from the sports and they care about some other things
SPEAKER_04: more than just size alone. You know, this guy has, okay, 60 something bicep. Okay, so let's wash that only. Of course, you need to wash that one too, but you can't ignore this beauty. I know it. I know it. I am coming from there. I know what I have been through, you know. Yeah. Little by little, I guess we will try to show our fans the quality of armwrestling we can do, and let's hope people will enjoy it.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I hope so. I hope so. I hope that you know, and I hope that as I always say that you guys, even when I try to a little bit like pull the Kazakh guys to the trash talk type, you know, it is I do my part. And I'm happy that they do their part, that they stick with their principles. And they say, this is even this is good.
SPEAKER_04: that people who watch this they understand it and he is doing his best and look at the guy he's just still on his own way so now they are known in this way people this way or that way they are getting to know these people understand they may think that you know just because they don't speak english that's why they don't do anything but it is not because of that it's also their personality that way so it is also good for western people to get to know through
SPEAKER_04: nature of these people as well, you know? Yeah, yeah. Anyways, I'm thankful and honored to have you guys on this stage. Hopefully we will be doing more and more and more, more the community to support more I will be supporting the arm wrestling, but let's see how where it will go. And I think that we are, as always is a big iceberg. People only see
SPEAKER_04: this small part here, a lot big is hidden there. Hopefully the world will discover that. Once they discovered it, I will be done with promotion because they will be, I will be like, okay, now I get my... And you can relax. Yeah, I can say because now it is where it deserves to be. But as for right now, no stopping for me. But let's see. Anyway, so if you...
SPEAKER_04: Okay, let's continue about the event. Are you guys ready to do some prediction? Sure. Yeah. Okay, let's start. Do you know Douglas Erich? Yes, I was supposed to. I was supposed to fight him. Oh, okay. He's going to put Rymond Liepins. I had a match planned with him.
SPEAKER_04: in wal oh yeah and it didn't happen yeah yeah and and how do you see this match probably if you had a match with him said you know not you didn't have it but it was set but it didn't happen because of the probably the the the pandemic so you probably analyzed him you know so how do you see that match with uh raymond
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Doug is a bit mysterious, like not too many fights of him are on the internet. Seems like he's simply a strong guy, but I don't think he has too much experience yet. So, Ray being very experienced recently and his power level is getting higher and higher, I feel like Ray has a pretty good chance.
SPEAKER_04: It would be still beautiful to see if Doug can just outpower Ray and just crush him. But let's see. So you are saying that Ray has the edge? I think so, yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm not going to ask the same question to Nurdale because Nurdale probably doesn't know Douglas. And I will just go with one of the guys that he would know. And then...
SPEAKER_04: Let's go with Alijan Murado with Oleg Petrenko with left arm. And I don't know if you can be objective since Alijan is your countryman. How do you see this match? .
SPEAKER_01: I think that Ali Pjan is going to win because the last time he won the championship 100 in the plus, he is in a good shape. But does he know about Oleg Petrenko? Does he know him? Yes. He knows, okay. And how do you see that match in the US?
SPEAKER_02: um yeah like seeing uh alijan no no sorry um the kazakh name can you can you repeat the kazakhstan name okay so murato seeing murato kill everyone at vaf was just incredible he seemed so unstoppable it's a bit hard to judge like the level between this amateur and professional armor sling
SPEAKER_02: can or is maybe oleg also at that high level i don't know it's hard to hard to tell but um somehow it's hard to bet against um murato but at the same time i just saw what happened the um
SPEAKER_02: Zurab and Oleg Petrenko. Oleg and Zurab. And so again. Did you know that Petrenko beat Dadikian at the Zloty Tur 2019? 95 kg final. Yes, yes. I was actually surprised that Oleg lost against John. That was a big surprise to me. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In my mind, Oleg is just such a beast. So, I don't know. It's tough. If John wasn't that experienced and well-skilled, I don't think that
SPEAKER_04: uh oleg petrenko was any weaker than john you know you would beat him trust me if you could apply if you had a little bit cup but he was just jonas but then oleg is also probably better on the left right um i think it's like equally same in my opinion but but where where john find the weakness on olexane i don't think alijan can find so alijan is gonna go you know but i think alijan has the edge
SPEAKER_04: uh advantage with with the speed explosiveness while uh oleg has all about horsepower but it's a slow puller you know and also oleg is heavier naturally and then then alijan alijan will be probably 97 98 kilo yeah maximum 100 and then while oleg petrenko will be 105 kilo this is for 105 kilo uh world title but just imagine how good alijan is
SPEAKER_04: pull 105 kilo world title you know that but the guy just after we win in waff in super heavyweight you for sure deserve yeah somehow if i had to bet money on somebody i would probably choose murato feels like the speed is gonna be a killer yeah anyway so let's go another one and nordalet gabriela
SPEAKER_04: Vasconcelos versus Barbara. Does he know Barbara, the super heavyweight world champion, world champion and 90 kilo Gabriela? Yeah. Brazil is coming. Brazil is coming.
SPEAKER_01: I think the brazil gabriel is gonna win and because he's uh 24 times champion of the world sorry so but just he thinks that gabriel is gonna win because she has more world titles
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because she has more experience. Experience, yeah. And how do you see that one? You were surprised when Gabriela won against Egle? Yeah. So, to me also, I don't think Egle was at her best, apparently. She was surprisingly...
SPEAKER_02: um low weight but uh i'm still impressed by gabriella a lot so i'm not betting against her anytime soon and even if our girl is a lot bigger sometimes maybe you know having a short arm is not necessarily an advantage if you have enough power behind it
SPEAKER_04: so maybe barbara will find it hard to deal with the technical aspect of the fight i don't know i'm going to gabriella now today i watched some gabriella video when usually she goes sideways here she was fully going out i don't know her intention about posting that but if she's going fully out
SPEAKER_04: that seems to me a better choice than going direct because when you go direct side, Barbara can use her hand better. And so it is if you can enable Barbara's wrist by going outside because I saw when Egle was training with Barbara, it was of course one and a half years ago almost, she was taking the hand. So I was just thinking that
SPEAKER_04: I mean Egle is more technical than Gabriela so that is why she was you know not allowing Barbara to use strength and but whenever I saw that Gabriela is training fully outside so now the things are a bit different for me as well because I was thinking that you know this this Gabriela um short
SPEAKER_04: arm while barbara has the leverage so i was thinking that it could be dangerous for you know if if i would i said this before gabriella i would for sure attack the hand you know like you don't want to go you don't want to get hit by her side pressure why is going there you know so let's see how it will be anyway so um let's go another one um can you ask uh does he know corey west
SPEAKER_01: Michael told his training partner with a beard, 200 kilo guy. Does he know who he is?
SPEAKER_02: um yeah like uh i i know corey he is he is getting a lot better lately um and he's huge arif of course has plenty of good results but actually i don't for example if you would ask me about arif i don't really remember exactly how does he fight
SPEAKER_04: so um it is like a little bit drop hand and loading and then hitting sideways usually you you to be out of usually you need to have extreme upper liability to when he's going you need to get out of your hand his hand you know usually that is maybe maybe corey would have to grip him low to stop him from doing that small low hand
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but he doesn't go fully out like this. He just loads and then it's sideways. No, I mean, I'm sure that both sides, they already made their game plan and prepared themselves. But so you're basically saying that Corey will win? I think so, yeah. I'm not betting against Corey. Corey is in good shape, only getting better. Plenty of strength, so I think so.
SPEAKER_04: understand and and how does he see him with left arm with ferid osman you're asking no no i'm asking you because he doesn't know corey west ah okay um yeah that's an interesting one you you mentioned that uh osman lee is in a very good shape lately right yeah but he didn't do well at chechnya he and gachevsky together
SPEAKER_04: there was a lot of light problems to Chechnya. So it too nice this spending airports in different airports, I think, and then they said that, but he said that four or 5am in the morning, they finally arrived to the city. And then they come. You know, this is what they said. And they didn't do well both gushes and ferrets. But but he says that he's in very good shape. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: is heavy 140 kilo he will be competition day is what he says you will see and his home country and everything less traveling yeah it's hard to bet against uh ferret this time maybe i would say just 50 50 but uh you are saying maybe because of experience and maybe also because of being the home country and
SPEAKER_02: maybe even you know he didn't do well in the previous competition maybe this time he's even more motivated i feel like he'll collect himself and do well okay then um i think you know that it wouldn't know who porkchop is curtis cameron and do you have any opinion about curtis cameron workshop versus yeah it seems like the two guys are somehow very similar right quite a little short and if
SPEAKER_04: This is just an example. If Zurab is large and the Curtis is X-Large, you know, but with the same build, same thing, but they're just one size bigger. 100 kilo and 115 kilo. So I wonder how does it go technically? I guess just pure hook, right? But they said that he also has top reliability.
SPEAKER_04: workshop yeah but having a little bit is maybe not enough right i mean sometimes when you do something a little bit is worse than not doing it at all you know you understand exactly so maybe just but we don't know yeah yeah let's see how it will be but yeah maybe we'll go inside we will see and who do you bet on well normally zurab is more established so i would i would have to say that it's zero but i'm interested maybe more proven
SPEAKER_04: yeah you need to prove himself it's hard to bet on someone we don't really know but it's for sure it's very interesting to see maybe the guy is worth it yeah yeah anyways so let's ask another thing that uh would know um
SPEAKER_01: Yep. Yes. I think that there's some of I'm gonna win. He has been participating in this world for many years and that he has more experience in this sport.
SPEAKER_04: so because of his experience but but pauline is in like super shape right now while rustem has been had been inactive for like three years uh does it like make any difference i need to play devils advocate all the time
SPEAKER_01: I think that Rustam Balaev is not just take this chance. He took this chance because he's very confident. I think that he's trying very hard.
SPEAKER_04: And we're going to see the table show that's what happens in the future. Yeah, yeah. He's saying that if Rustem wouldn't be confident, he wouldn't take this match. And he says that probably Rustem is knowledgeable and experienced enough to know what he can do and what he cannot do. This is what he says, basically, I understand. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And how do you see this match, Bindagos?
SPEAKER_02: an interesting one stylistically because i feel like both guys are better at quickly going into where they're winning position meaning like they both want to go towards the pad and uh you know one of them will obviously fail uh i kind of feel like i can see the match being happening where um
SPEAKER_02: Paul N is jumping even maybe a bit faster and the match stops in Rustam being a little bit defensive position. I know it's weird, but that's how I see it. And then I feel like Rustam will bring it back. So you are saying Paul may be faster, but Rustam will be stronger.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I think I have seen Rustam being able to kind of fight in this good locked position, like defensive a little bit if he has to. And I don't think Paulin is good at it. I think if Paulin does not manage to bring the match towards the pad, that will be it, I feel like. But I agree with Paulin a little bit.
SPEAKER_02: I gripped his hand, but I felt like he could be really good at this initial surge. And he's also not afraid to drag the elbow. And so he's really bringing his whole body and just falling sideways. So I have a feeling that he will be able to execute that first surge. Were you surprised when he dominated Gamtenaze? For sure, yeah. I mean, again, you know, I'm saying this again, but
SPEAKER_02: am not surprised i wouldn't be surprised you know with them winning but this dominance i was surprised i was also surprised when he beat uh samusha okay maybe samusha is somehow out of shape or something so this last win of poland it really proved that he is at a very high level very high yeah okay let's go another one um this one
SPEAKER_04: uh you already know window said he's gonna be 90 percent nor the let nor the let's says only god knows what's gonna happen and craig tuller david samusha i mean that was okay so um people are saying that craig tuller is in a very good shape
SPEAKER_02: which we cannot be completely sure about it, but we can at least be sure that Samusha is in a fantastic shape. I would give an edge to Samusha. But who knows? Maybe Craig can surprise us. Craig is also a very explosive guy. People may not know, but he has international experience as well. In 2001, he took second in WAF course two years in a row.
SPEAKER_02: yeah craig is one of the more experienced guys for sure so you couldn't compare craig to poland for example poland is very still quite new craig is an all-time great craig is great people may not know but craig is probably 50 years old yeah yeah or 49 50 around there you know yeah but the guy is just like a rock still
SPEAKER_04: I feel like Samusha has the ability to deal with this quick sideways kind of hook. He will just cut and drag. Yeah, but listen, any European guy, if they are at the very top level in five, six, seven years, they would have incredible level of experience by competing in European and world every year.
SPEAKER_04: that that that experience, you cannot find anywhere else in the world, especially if you were competed in those years, you know, European wars in Zloty three times a year. It is I mean, I cannot even imagine any more than this, you know, just like incredible experience. Does he does he know Craig? Does Nur Dalet know Craig? No, we don't know about the Craig. That's why I didn't want to ask you.
SPEAKER_04: and some of them they will not know either but let's go like for example michael todd and ongar web i'm sure he's gonna say ongar wave is gonna win but does he have him analyzing analyzing you know instead of saying ongar wave is gonna win but
SPEAKER_01: Yes, absolutely. I think that Ongar Bayev is going to win because we are supporting each other and we are training together. And I know that he is in good shape.
SPEAKER_04: We're going to say. Yeah. But I think Ongarbev is the winner. What? I didn't understand the last part. Ongarbev is the winner, I think. Oh, okay. Yeah, we had Ongarbev as our guest some days ago, and he said his shape right now is better than his top eight shape. And we know that these guys, they don't bullshit. You know, when they say something, they really mean it, you know.
SPEAKER_02: and so how do you see if that is the case uh mean nervous um but that's gonna be a fun match i can see it being a very good one for sure not a quick one um so um michael normally allows people to
SPEAKER_02: uh control his um hand a little bit you know he's not um he will not finish the match too quickly especially if you ignore the press maybe my biggest question is how will uh um deal with his press but let's hope that on the best look at some kind of side pressure and he can resist it so
SPEAKER_02: so uh if the match ends up ends up looking a little bit like um you know in the center um on grabio has the hand control michael tries to open top roll a bit um then i think i kind of like the possibilities of hunger buyer because um he has plenty of endurance he can flop wrist a little bit you can press a little bit um
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And, you know, normally if a person has enough endurance, then I feel like he will manage to get a good position against Michael and then little by little just outlast him. And the only, of course, problem which I see for Ongarbaev is the press. Maybe the press will be too much. I mean, it depends, you know, what is the hand position, arm position before that press.
SPEAKER_04: if it is in like not so good position i don't think so but if the question here is like not michael the question is the opponent of michael does he know how to deal with it or not if he knows how to deal with it does he because you know when something is not enough is he able to do that like is he able to do that also is he strong enough to do that like does
SPEAKER_02: Is Ongarbeu smart enough to deal with that? Yes, he's smart enough. We should ask Mourad Oulet if Ongarbeu is training at all in this floppiest press, if he's getting comfortable, because if Ongarbeu is not doing any of that, then I think it's a mistake. Ongarbeu, I just ask him.
SPEAKER_04: do you do your own training or are you doing a specific training for Michael? And he said he's doing a specific training for Michael. But also, we do not know also who's going to take who's hand. We do not know that. Michael may take his hand, but he may take Michael's hand. We do not know that. Does he have the joint strength? On Garber, he has the joint strength as well. But he is smart enough
SPEAKER_04: he's tall enough you know um he's technical enough he's he's strong enough john but also so he has enough skills in my opinion but even when you have enough skills it doesn't mean that you can beat the guy because there we do not know how strong you are how strong michael so but technically i cannot say that this guy doesn't know
SPEAKER_04: what to do about Michael. That guy is, trust me, one of the smartest guys, and he can pull in bad position. Do you remember his match with Alex Kurdeca? Yeah, incredible. Yeah, I would never expect, because the only way we know is the hunter, you know, you need to really catch him, you know, you need to overpower him. But here, his wrist was taken, everything was taken, and he still had the
SPEAKER_04: joint pressure so he's not depending on full hand control either so i think that's gonna be an incredible match and like like i will be i mean i'll say holding my breath you know what during that match for sure and i will realize that i'm holding my breath only after the match ends and i will go probably you know no you might die because it might take a while what's that
SPEAKER_04: so you might die because it will take maybe five six minutes or even more so you don't know how good i am about holding my breath you don't know how many world records i have at least at least we know that you cannot hold breath for longer than me right yeah yeah some somebody will warn me you know when i get so red and just you know anyway so it is going to be an incredible mesh people don't realize another one okay can i interrupt you a little bit
SPEAKER_02: yeah uh i just remember the maybe you know i was interested if nordolet has any like what kind of job does he have or is he only doing arm wrestling because we never know you know these kazakhs kazakh pullers they keep getting support from the government i can see him winning cars yeah he is basically asking that
SPEAKER_04: I'm asking that if Nord Oled is not doing any other job, he's going to use this right away for an excuse after he lost. He's going to say, oh, of course, you know. Yeah. Just joking. What kind of job Nord Oled has? Or maybe just armwrestling?
SPEAKER_01: I am a sportsman. I work in the city of Tandavra.
SPEAKER_01: only i work only in the sports i'm training and i'm coaching and i have two children the school children who won the title two of the two so he is not only our master he is also a trainer yes yeah yeah he is coaching and he's training
SPEAKER_04: okay so now now after mindagos loses against you he's gonna say oh he doesn't have a job like i do that's why he won't coaching is also like oh it's the same as he only does arm wrestling yeah okay okay but okay whatever it's a bigger victory for me oh okay okay yeah i'm just teasing i mean that was just easy you know yeah anyway so
SPEAKER_04: yeah anyway so i i hope you're translating right my jokes you know i hope you didn't understand me maybe they will be angry on you yeah yeah yeah i'm just joking you know like binagas will find an excuse when he loses against nur that this is what i am joking you know just just to tease me nervous um anyway so let's go
SPEAKER_04: another one big one the ones that you will probably not remember like for example if i would ask you uh robert baxter versus ahmed general would you would you recognize them yeah i saw a poster but i i couldn't recognize them yeah that is why this is very very uh hard i i only with neil pickup i was able to discuss about them because he knows and other than that let's go to the match of
SPEAKER_04: the greatest of all time. First of all, I would like to ask you that it's not the prediction. I want to ask him first, to tell us what does he think about jamborees? Who is jamborees for him? Okay.
SPEAKER_01: John Brzenk is the founder of Congress. He is the founder of the World Tourism Organization. He is the founder of Congress. He is the founder of the World Tourism Organization. He is the founder of Congress.
SPEAKER_01: um this this sportsman is very big and a great sportsman because he is in this sport before uh this this sport starts and he is a legend i think and if i'm not mistaken he's the 24 or 25 6 uh world champion and i'm very very expect him and he's a great guy yeah yeah he is bigger than world titles
SPEAKER_04: um there are many americans that they claim having like tens of world titles they actually won in their own country against their countrymen but uh john is not one of them john is an american that has gone to everywhere in the world where he is challenged he went to japan the soviets
SPEAKER_04: to Russia, to Alan Karev, to Poland, to Denis Tsiplenko, Pushkar, Perich, Semerenko, Taras, to Istanbul, to Poole, Arsen Liliyev, Krasimir, to everywhere. The guy is absolute legends. He is equal to arm wrestling. That is if Americans are really looking for a true hero,
SPEAKER_02: That is John Brzenk. I don't know if you agree with what I said. Yeah, for sure, for sure. It seems like Brzenk is an inspiration behind many people's, many armwrestlers' dreams. We saw him performing well and beating everyone, and we want to be as good as him if that's possible. So he's truly an inspiration.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways, and what does he think? What does Nurda think about his match against Irakli? It's obvious that John is not his very prime, but he is still very, very good enough to beat guys young enough to be the age of his kid. And then there is Irakli, who is the training partner of
SPEAKER_04: levan and he is bigger than ever right now stronger than ever and levan is telling him telling john to stay at home not to come and he says of course levan has the utmost respect for john he calls him king through king
SPEAKER_01: He just says this just to probably a little bit steer the boat, but that is exactly how he also thinks that Iraq is going to win. What does Nurdale think about all this?
SPEAKER_01: yes uh i'm just saying and uh the match of the iraqi iraqi is a great way and the match between them is gonna be great and this that's the super much i think and that's a prediction
SPEAKER_01: That's tough to say who's going to win. It's like 50-50. Yeah, it's like 50-50. And Mindagos. Let's go. Yeah, to me it's difficult. East versus West 5. Petrenko said that
SPEAKER_04: now arm wrestling is in new era and he said east versus west is the proof of this and he's gonna go and prove this against john brzing the things didn't go as petrenko expected so now iraqli is even more confident he seems more confident than petrenko
SPEAKER_02: How do you see this match? Yeah, so just after seeing how Brzenk beat Petrenko, that alone makes it very hard to bet against Brzenk. But also in my mind, I still remember Irakli fighting with me in like 70 kilo classes. So for me mentally, it's so hard to put Irakli in those high classes.
SPEAKER_02: high categories um and still imagine him doing well so somehow i don't know it's hard to bet on iraqli i don't know why it is so but like you know you never know maybe he is that much bigger that much stronger nowadays he's training of levan eating the same thing as levan so maybe but still i i'm not betting against john anymore like i made him i made this mistake last time
SPEAKER_04: uh i will not do it twice in a row yeah before this program i did some table time and this this lateral is just killing me so sorry about it i'm all kind of robin you know you just you just um so much hurting anyway so i don't know i don't know do you would you agree that neither has like pure restraint to control the others pronators
SPEAKER_04: Like neither can do this to other one. Jones pronator, I don't think it actually can control totally. Like you may not totally control with wrist, but when you have so much back pressure and make your openness wrist like weak, and then you can, you know, the rest can do with your wrist. That is possible, but not like pure wrist. So both has very strong outside pronator.
SPEAKER_04: And I'm just thinking that my opinion, Irakli needs to take Jones' wrist without losing his own to win. And as I said this many times, I repeat every program, if they both stay like natural wrist and like this, even Irakli has stronger maybe back pressure. But I think Jones' pronated side pressure is more...
SPEAKER_04: experience more there is more muscle memory just remember even this guy is 58 if his shoulder allows him just try to imagine the pressure he has been going through against like dennis against like
SPEAKER_04: very good you see that the what kind of memory is there you know you know it's scary you know when you think about it it's just totally scary you know so you it is very hard to beat John in that equal position game like when on Garvey did on Garvey finally eventually take the wrist you understand like this and he remained him they didn't really stay like this you know
SPEAKER_02: And also, maybe John made a mistake with Ongrabaye, right? He kept thinking that he is stronger and he will outlast, but no. And also, when did we ever see John being put in that position where he's losing his wrist completely? It doesn't really happen, right? I mean, if it happens, he loses, you know. But I really remember it happening. Yes, he made the mistake against Ongrabaye, but otherwise...
SPEAKER_04: I don't really see it happening, so I would go with John. Yeah, anything is possible. I see a close match. I also see another danger in Irakli's position. When your arm is getting so strong, you're getting big, you have more horsepower. So you started to not care about your hand control anymore. You understand?
SPEAKER_04: and but sometimes you need the first unlock and then in the guy like we talk like this because to beat guys like this like john may not be i see that the last video i see um which of course is le one that is training of course but i didn't see him fighting for you know and yes you understand i saw him
SPEAKER_04: either who can live on, or he wanted to just go like, like a peer pressure, instead of applying pressure, but we said, Oh, not applying pressure and then stay in it. And then securing the full control first, like like on that wave, the wave didn't go through on God wave just, you know, he wanted to first secure the position, and then went for the beam. But whenever people are getting
SPEAKER_04: super strong they are kind of forgetting the importance of positioning you understand my point very well yeah so that may be the case for iraqi sometimes being so strong can blind you and can make you overconfident but i'm not saying it's going to happen because if he's super super strong he may even dominate john we don't know that yet i'm only telling you this
SPEAKER_04: Let's remember how Irakli beat Barboza, right? That was very impressive. Yeah, but he was just like, hands and wrists. Yeah, so good. It means that the power level is high. Irakli has plenty of power. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Whenever, even he said this on live show, whenever Irakli lost against Tatachins,
SPEAKER_04: Like I was still managing the event. He was like, come down, come, come. And I was like, what came to the table? He's like, what am I doing wrong? I said, you're just only pulling the strap like this with your brachial radialis. And there is a pressure coming with the joint and the pressure is coming because the guy is protecting his angle. If you
SPEAKER_04: also use your wrist like this. And if you put him to this position, you won't be able to, but you are just pulling the strap here. The guy is just hitting you sideways and you are trying to hold on with your muscle brachioradialis alone. It's not, you need to really use your hand, wrist and side pressure to control the guy's pronator. And then you need to do more table time instead of hanging here, 80 kilo, 90 kilo is good. Keep that, but just also
SPEAKER_02: actively use your hand wrist and everything stylistically he was really crushed in that match and it didn't seem like he was ready for that stylistic battle because that's the same very similar fight to me versus um right um todd is able to generate some kind of no it's different i mean i feel like that the key behind it is very similar no you'll have always your copying like this that that wasn't the case the the the
SPEAKER_04: Todd never left his pronator, and he never came forward like this. He's going sideways. Whenever he used, I mean, Irakli is going back, so whenever he is pulling, just look at one of the rounds, Irakli, when he's losing his wrist because of just pulling himself, and Todd Hutchings used his pronator so active way so that he was like... But me and Prokopchuk, it's the same thing. I'm also not able to fully control his pronator,
SPEAKER_04: but he's coming totally to you you know also not totally like he's simply like style is isolating my biceps like but your hand and wrist is not threaded you know nothing is in an active way is pulling you
SPEAKER_02: you know like out that way he's actually using more like tricep pressure no but i feel todd did the same thing to iraqli but he wasn't like trying to open his hand or anything just kind of dragging kind of side pressure no full hand control to me these are two very similar things not exactly the same but very similar just a screenshot for you how
SPEAKER_04: prokopchik is bringing his shoulder while how thad is keeping his angle when he's dragging the side weight the way that the way that thad beat it actually is the same exact way that alanzola beats uh emmy yeah so i understand it looks different but the very idea behind this flop wrist thing still is valid in both scenarios like
SPEAKER_04: well okay we can discuss it by the way your lightweight popularity was 70 viewers now 109 people watching so like lightweights but can you imagine this is world's super heavyweight title match podcast it should be like 500 people you know just carefully watching you guys so let's go let's go uh okay john and iraqli nordale says 50 50 match while
SPEAKER_04: mean that was said he gives the edge to john correct yes correct okay and then uh let's go to the super heavyweight title match jerry cadaret georgie swedco can you ask what he thinks about this
SPEAKER_01: I think that the Svetko has more chances to win because he is stronger and the speed more than Jiri Kadet.
SPEAKER_01: He knows Jerry, right? Yeah, because he has more or less with the breasts. And it's like dangerous for him because the Tsydkov can beat him with this breast because it's very easy to break it. Yeah, but just taking Jerry's wrist
SPEAKER_04: is the easiest thing in his category he is even happy to give it you know that that that is his style yeah um if he if he knew that it once would feel the pressure of jerry that he might have taken thinking a little bit differently but i respect his uh opinion about just has he watched has he watched gennady versus jerry
SPEAKER_04: Yes, I watched. Yeah, yeah. Before the match, Gennady said that, you know, he's gonna destroy him. And now, some days ago, Gennady, I asked Gennady, did your opinion change after feeling Jerry's power? And he said, yes, Engin. He said, if I knew what I know now,
SPEAKER_04: I wouldn't try to topple him. I would go directly inside on and I would train for inside directly from the round one. No, I'm just trying to tell you that it may be a big trap to topple Jerry. And then, of course, I will go to you, Minervis. And you know, you know, you know, probably you are probably the person that knows how Jerry's opponents are feeling more than probably anyone.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that represents more of Daniel. I remember your matches in Moldova, you know. And so he's saying that Nurdalet is saying that Georgi Swetko is the favorite and he's stronger, correct? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Nurdalet. Yeah. I mean, he needs to be faster. He needs to go fast because if Jerry puts his shoulder,
SPEAKER_04: then you may be too late. He needs to catch him here, you know? And how do you see that in Douglas?
SPEAKER_02: surprised by another prediction because uh yeah to me it's uh like this the matchup is so much in favor of jerry like stylistic matchup um yes uh georgie said he might still you know be smart and prepare in a special way like he must think that he will do more inside initially he will not necessarily top roll as much or
SPEAKER_02: but you know things don't change that quickly you cannot just decide to be good at something else you know georgie is mostly good georgie didn't have enough time to do a radical change to beat exactly yeah yeah i don't think he he would have enough time for that and we know that mostly georgie is good at simply sitting down and using all his mass while his elbow is still um
SPEAKER_02: know in a good shape and he just generates a lot of back pressure and he's able to open people's hands and that's his uh best move which i think jerry should handle very very well so i'm almost like 99.999 sure jerry's gonna win quite comfortably um so you are saying that jerry is beatable
SPEAKER_02: even maybe beatable by georgie but you are thinking that georgie to have two months to prepare for jerry may not be ready to beat jerry correct well of course if we had the two three years for georgie he might change his style completely and do some do better against jerry but yeah it takes a big big shift from his current state
SPEAKER_02: to be able to deal with Jerry. Currently, I don't see any chance for Jordi.
SPEAKER_02: I saw also Jerry just recently at VARF. No, I saw Georgi and he did quite well, but he was also, he lost against one Lithuanian guy who was able to press him. Left arm. Left arm, but still. I think Georgi cannot really deal well with Jerry's press for now. He said that he's training a lot for his, you know,
SPEAKER_04: lower wrist tendon oh but you know not enough time with bojidar krasimir sasho these are like guys but you know when you pull them one after another um let's see let's see i'm expecting simply to me like the stylistic matchup is just so bad for for georgie and and i don't want to underestimate it you know
SPEAKER_02: you expect an easy easy win or you expect the war it will take some time for jerry to outlast georgie but uh i would expect the later rounds to be quite easy already you are saying that jerry will catch georgie on his muscle yes it will be a war but one he is exhausted he said the rest of the rounds
SPEAKER_04: He will not be strong enough to handle it. He will not be able to stop it anymore. Just the first round or two. 99.99999% Jerry is going to win. So you would be shocked. I would be very shocked. And if he wins, would you just personally go? Yeah, I was going to go to Georgi and ask for tips. Like, how did you deal with Jerry so I can use it against Prokopchuk?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that what you are dealing with Prokopcik is probably as hard as what people are dealing with Jerry for that category. Yeah, I feel like Jerry might be the only guy who is equally annoying in the same way as Prokopcik is. Yeah, yeah. I agree. I agree. And if I also ask the last thing, Nur Dalet, in your opinion, who is the top five super heavyweight in the world?
SPEAKER_01: Who are they? Sorry.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, it's not in the order. It's just to say in the five. No, what is in the order? That one is order, right? Number one. First one is...
SPEAKER_04: First one is on their way. Yep. Okay. Second is Levan. And then third? Levan Larat. Levan Larat is third?
SPEAKER_04: it's it's very tough to say okay so top top three is ongar wave levan and uh devon this is what he says okay okay i understand and i i'm i'm kind of uh sure that that that also that is a support and respect that he is giving to his brother uh ongar of course i cannot talk for him but anyways and
SPEAKER_02: You, Mindaugas? Yeah, I guess I would be crazy if I chose anyone else than Levan at number one. But then number two, I would maybe even guess that Denis is close to number two. Listen, you are saying Denis without him even competing anywhere. Did you see his training with Zaur? Yes.
SPEAKER_04: I could see Dennis, if he's more serious, he could probably, because he did stop Zarek a little bit and then clearly had better endurance. Yeah, but he's like one, two, three and four stops. You don't pull four times in a row. Also, the guy had to pull Chechen competition like only two or three days before that one.
SPEAKER_02: i also know that dennis when um if he really wants to show up and he can prepare in a better way so uh and then yeah i met him last time in turkey and he was just so still massive and also so like bony um not soft at all so i i'm still giving him
SPEAKER_02: so you are saying number two is dennis in your opinion even though he didn't compete anywhere exactly yeah so i feel like he is planning to come back next this year right at the end of it and he might be able yeah i think at that time he will be the real number two to um yeah but one thing about dennis himself saying that you know hey here is the guy to pull the one for zaur
SPEAKER_04: and saying that he is number two himself so dennis is being humble you think maybe currently that's that's the situation currently but i feel like yeah another nine months for dennis should uh change quite a lot of things yeah you have 109 viewers it never happened 110 i think it's terrible
SPEAKER_04: will never do that i'm just joking so you are saying okay number two is dennis who is number three oh yeah that's already difficult hard to hard to say come on too many guys are fighting so you are saying that like not not any candidate you can say that these four guys are candidates for number three or something
SPEAKER_02: um okay let's take uh devon um so number one number two levan dennis and then for number three we are looking for one is devon candidate and let's see uh against zaur and lost against hrp so they chafee also but you know whatever happened happened
SPEAKER_04: all any of these guys can still do well listen listen like this way do you do you think that why do we even like you even put some training pools
SPEAKER_04: over actual results you know when you are doing it of course i i respect what you are saying but why do you this guys pull against each other if you are going to ignore what happened there you know because we're talking about current rankings we are not saying that they would happen this different day this happened this you know but but these guys are actually putting there are results there's one winner and the guy one loses i mean when we say that like when we ignore this why are they even pulling you know
SPEAKER_02: so if you are talking about the like the current results because i was talking about what else can we put you even talking about the practice pool that didn't stop zaur you know and then you are making a calculation from a practice pool even how he looks bonnie look but but not the guy that beat the other guy or something you know i guess in my mind i'm simply searching for some possible opponents for uh levan right and i'm thinking like who could who
SPEAKER_04: could get in shape and uh be a problem for levan it's a different thing like levan finding levan opponent is a little bit different subject but who deserves to be number three who deserves to be ranked around there whenever i ask kennedy kennedy said that perry also said that like zao needs to prove himself in some super matches is what they said and they said that for number two not perry but kennedy said that for number two he said
SPEAKER_04: uh there is Hermes Morozo and Jerry but he not in order they said that these guys can beat each other and but but I realized that Gennady talk very highly about Jerry like he was very surprised by Jerry's uh power and I said this a few times before I will repeat again before that match we were eating outside and
SPEAKER_04: John told me that if Gennady goes outside, he will make a huge mistake and he's going to lose. And I said, you sure? He said, yeah, just watch. If he goes outside like this, he's going to lose the match. And that happened. The match was very close. Gennady could have won, but of course Jerry ended winning. But so, yeah. So you are saying Devin is there. Like when you think about these guys, who would beat the other one?
SPEAKER_04: but just you need to call it it's a bit hard because already met you know like like lalatin they pull they beat him so lalatin recently cannot be ranked about dave like and also sorry but they lost against hermes
SPEAKER_04: Hard to put him over Hermes, you understand? So, I mean, why do they even pull if he's going to rank above him while he's losing to him recently, you understand? You may beat him three months later and rank above him, but now I don't think that we can rank that way, you know? We need to, of course, you can, there's a calculation if they never pulled recently or never ever, you know, something. What do you think about Zaur versus Hermes? Who's winning that match in your head?
SPEAKER_02: i think i would go with zaur quite effective top roll might be good enough to turn off hermes you think you'll find the top roll or outer side pressure yeah like yeah side pressure but then a bit of hand control and then good side pressure so yeah let's put pronator base yeah but you know he does it every time so it's always the same yeah yeah yeah so you are saying that zaur would beat hermes and how do you think morozov and zaur
SPEAKER_02: uh marozo is a bit better at maybe maybe marozo would have a chance to um get our inside after some rounds so uh that would be interesting but if he cannot then yeah i would be leaning it's not gonna get angry with me by saying this i said this before but i asked morozo
SPEAKER_04: And Morozov said that he needs to get bigger, he needs a little bit of time to pull someone like Zaur. This is what he told me. I'm not saying that he cannot or this, but he shows that kind of respect. And how do you see Morozov versus Hermes?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it could be a triangle, for example. Maybe I can see what Hermes. Yeah, Marozol. Zaur and Zaur flashing. This is how we are seeing. Yeah. And how about if you put Jerry? Yeah. Jerry there. Jerry. Okay, so Jerry beats Zaur. Jerry beats Hermes very easily. Oh, Jerry beats Hermes?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Jerry beats Hermes, and Jerry beats everyone. One second. Hermes, we have a guy here that he said that Jerry is going to beat you very easily. Yeah, he's a lightweight guy, yeah. Okay, come on.
SPEAKER_02: So now Hermes knows that he doesn't even need the fight, right? He kind of... What's that? What's that? So Hermes will trust me and he knows that there's no point in fighting Jerry. So I think he will just... He will have to admit that, yes, Jerry is better. Yeah, whenever people say Jerry is going to beat him, he laughs. And Jerry is also very confident about himself. Yeah, I see Jerry beating all three of these guys, like Marouz, Zouzaou and Hermes.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. And also may hook and turn Jerry inside. So, yeah, Marozov has the highest chance. Because of his ability to go in. Just your ability to bring Jerry to this position. Yeah. Instead of here. Yeah. Turning his pronator, not with only wrist, but also with pressure. Yeah. And he can cup pretty hard. So he can. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: yeah okay okay so he doesn't have to depend breaking radialis alone yeah and also marozo is long enough tall enough so the cupping is quite like effective so yeah wow wow and how do you see devon they will not up with these guys i have that one was a bit heavier again oh yeah or just say that devon and aramis had 120 kilo weight cups
SPEAKER_02: I would go with Devon. Strong enough to stop the match and then just uncomfortable for Hermes. So yeah, I would go with Devon. So you are saying that Devon is going to stop him and beat him by endurance? Yeah, yeah. Just being... It might look ugly, but I feel like Hermes would not be able to finish it.
SPEAKER_02: And Devon versus Morozov? Maybe here I would give higher chance for Morozov again because Morozov can go a bit deeper. He can maybe go around Devon's... Coronator. Forward move. And that is very hard to hook Devon. If he goes fully down, then it is more possible with the rule now is only here.
SPEAKER_04: oh yeah he may be dangerous and this guy when he hooked Revas right away round one not stopping here but right away you know he was very surprising and another thing that surprised me Revas to be so competitive in hook and then he was in more offensive position and Morozov was hardly hardly Morozov's head
SPEAKER_04: I thought he was going to explode, you know, just like that kind of pressure. But once he stopped, he slowly exhausted Rewaz. So I guess Rewaz made a mistake. He didn't have to fight that hard in the hook, right? Yeah, but listen, he probably felt like he could hook him anyways. And hooking Rewaz like that, you know, that's not an easy thing to do, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: anyway so and one more thing is our versus uh devon and then we can finish 50 50 or maybe no maybe maybe flashes three times yeah once devon stops then everything may be different yeah so maybe for sure a couple of flashes from zaur and then
SPEAKER_04: We don't know if there are more enough to share. By the way, we had 111 viewers. You are popular now. Wow. Anyway, sorry to Nurdalet that we had this kind of conversation. It was kind of long. And thank you very, very much, Nurdalet. It will be an honor to host you here. You are
