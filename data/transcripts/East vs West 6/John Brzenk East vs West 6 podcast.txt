SPEAKER_04: Joseph DiCarlo, Managing Director, Oh Jonas here, how did I not see that. Joseph DiCarlo, Managing Director, Hello john. Joseph DiCarlo, Managing Director, When did you come. Joseph DiCarlo, Managing Director, You just came a couple three minutes ago. Joseph DiCarlo, Managing Director, Listen to answer three or four questions. Joseph DiCarlo, Managing Director, I didn't even realize you're good yeah. Joseph DiCarlo, Managing Director, Because. Joseph DiCarlo, Managing Director, I didn't know the program was going on i'm going. Joseph DiCarlo, Managing Director, How long you been. Joseph DiCarlo, Managing Director, yeah yeah. Joseph DiCarlo, Managing Director, So.
SPEAKER_00: This is the official East vs. West YouTube channel. Oh, okay. This is not like my personal channel. Okay. So, how have you been, John? I'm good. Good. Still a little sore from the Oleg match. I didn't think I'd put that much effort into it. From what? Shoulder?
SPEAKER_04: i'm just everywhere i mean my whole my i told you i got like a little stinger on the inside of my elbow which i haven't had in a long long time um yeah i don't know just from being being top rolled like that and allowing him to really press in with that shoulder roll yeah you were like this and then you must stretch that yeah because it's yeah yeah nothing major but it's just a yeah like occasionally i'll put some pressure and go oh so you know it's a little jolt or a little stinger yeah i'm you know
SPEAKER_00: Trying to heal up for the next couple of super matches. Yeah, for sure. This time you are not going to have the pressure in the same direction, at least in the last part of the match, you know. You will be more like they will be attacking your hand. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Less side pressure, more back pressure. There'll be side pressure too, but it'll be different. Yeah, it'll be different. Not in tournament. It'll be, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Um, but we'll see how it goes. I mean, always, I always think to myself, you know, those guys like hunger by of indirectly are, are, you know, obviously super strong, but they're, they become even that more, more dangerous for a guy like me, just because of their, um, their jolting speed or, you know, their hits. So, um, if the timing just isn't right, it could be, it could be bad. Um, they, they.
SPEAKER_00: want to prove themselves they they see you as the bar you know like let's see let's see are we still like not good enough or good enough you know let's see this is how they see this is how i understand that's how i understand that they see that there's jumbo things like let's see where i am and but i saw um if you remember oleg petrenko was also very uh confident
SPEAKER_00: He said that, you know, the old era was closed. Now the new era started. And then East versus West is the proof of this. The proof is, yeah. And it didn't go as he expected. Now I see, I see Irakli in the same way, like very, very confident.
SPEAKER_04: you know, all these, all these guys are, are very, very close. So it's, it's, you know, teeter totter could go either way for any of those matches. So, um, it's just all about, you know, the timing and just, you know, um, good day, bad day. Uh, so many factors. I mean, I think, I think the competition is so closely matched now that it's, um, yeah, it's, it could go either way, just depending upon the time of day or the day of the week or, you know, so, um,
SPEAKER_04: It's exciting. I have a question for you. How would you compare someone like Terasi Watanabe with these guys? He possibly could win and then possibly not. I mean, if a reckless posting top roll could shut down
SPEAKER_04: You know, his, his top role. Um, yeah, I mean, he, he relied so much at Taurus relied so much on that kind of low hand Cobra top role. And, and the counter to that, I think is just good. High knuckles, high back pressure and directly kind of has that. So, but yeah, I mean, it could have teeter tottered either way. I've directly thought he needed to try to get a little bit more control with a hand than Taurus could have, you know, obviously ripped him open. Um, do you, do you, do you agree that it was harder to hook Taurus?
SPEAKER_00: than beat him outside? No, I think it was, in my mind, it probably would have been easier to hook Taras than it would be to hook correctly. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not comparing them. I'm just comparing only Taras' hook with Taras' top roll. Like to hook Taras was kind of harder than top roll him because I remember you and him in Yalta,
SPEAKER_00: you were trying it was going and then you were pronating and then beating without the wrist with the side pressure but very seldom you hook him you know
SPEAKER_04: especially my pressure on yeah i guess it's always been a little dangerous to me but i mean i think if i had some more time to to really pull with taurus more often i might have developed that confidence to to maybe make it an easier match by hooking him because he has long levers i mean i never would chance grabbing him low lower on the hand and wrist to really shut down that that hand that he had
SPEAKER_00: um and he wasn't really super strong i mean there was plenty of guys that were a lot stronger than than him in a hook so i mean if i could have gotten him yeah the problem was with the hook and him you know getting them i remember in 2004 europeans um he and do you remember uh clemenco yeah yeah at the europeans 2004 and clemenco was still 18 he tried to hook
SPEAKER_00: Taras and Taras beat him so easy. In the final, twice he toppled with Taras. In fact, I don't remember so many times that, you know, somebody is hooking Taras here. Yeah. So I'm just thinking that even when you beat him most of the times, you beat him with your like pronated, you know, the side pressure. He went and then you went here. You both neutralized wrists.
SPEAKER_04: It might not have been the easiest way to approach Taurus, but it was the safest way. I mean, because if failing to try to secure the hook didn't work, I got beat. I mean, at least with the top roll, it's a battle. It might have been a lot tougher to win that way, but it was safer. I wasn't going to get beat if I failed at doing it as easily. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And at that time you were pulling like 209. Now you are more like at 230s. Do you think that you are older now compared to that time, but just also you are heavier. So do you think that how you are right now can be as
SPEAKER_04: strong as at least 29 shape of john when he's young or because you are heavy but you're questioning a bunch but it's just different i mean i'm 20 pounds heavier but it really is just old age you know i won't say completely fat but it's a lot of belly fat and a lot of just fat throughout my whole body that is creating this extra 20 pounds
SPEAKER_04: so you're not really bigger in muscle i'm not bigger in the muscles i don't think um and even if i was a little bit bigger i think that negates um the the pop and the speed and the um strength that i have because of the nervous system as it is yeah yeah yeah so that's the one thing missing
SPEAKER_04: It's, it's, it's hard to, it's hard to compare or translate that extra muscle strength to real power on the arm wrestling table because you can't, you can't get your brain to, to make it work, to fire it like you did when you were younger. So, um, yeah, I mean, looking back, I mean, I, when I look at footage of myself when I was in my twenties and thirties, I mean, I was a thin tennis player looking guy that didn't really have a whole hell of a lot of muscle at all, but
SPEAKER_00: obviously super strong tendons and great. Yeah. Yeah. Forearm was big. Forearm was big. Yeah, the hand control was always here. Yeah. Yeah. I remember your match with Alan Carré. When Alan Carré was trying to beat you, you top rolled him here and then the camera was showing from inside here, the forearm with all kinds of muscles. Yeah, you had for sure a big forearm. Yeah. And one can also see that you
SPEAKER_00: Um, like I have been in this for so long time. I mean, it is so easy to understand the difference between weight built forearm and the forearm, uh, armless and built forearm. So yours is, you can see, you can see that it's Tony. I mean, all you, you know, obviously you can look back at even your history. I mean, you were 140, 150 pound, really thin build, thin upper arm. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But I cannot leave the way, so I was lifting. You know yeah incredibly effective more effect, even if it's not even. Yes, compared to place but way more effective on the arm wrestling table yeah being twice the size that you are. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah yeah yeah yeah it's hard to argue you know.
SPEAKER_04: i'm ready to give away all the muscle and then get back my tendons the mental connection yeah like that connection of being able to just lock it down and fire and hit hard and not be you know so i guess i guess it's probably similar to um you know baseball players you know throwing 100 mile an hour pitch right i mean um all the extra muscle you would think would be able to you know pull that off you know
SPEAKER_00: better but it really is a negative effect right he's still he's going to be more powerful um you know younger and thinner and that connection being there than many yeah that explosiveness makes so much different people probably don't understand i mean how fast you reach your max maximum power that that is very very important because the guy can be like just say hundreds you may be 90
SPEAKER_00: But he reaches his 100 in long time that you catch him when he's at 70. Well, if you're faster than him, so that makes so much difference. But people, some people don't understand that, you know, how important that the signal
SPEAKER_04: And we have so many examples of that, right? So many European guys that are not so much strong, if they let the match or slow pull or do a practice pull with their competition, they would probably get beat nine times out of 10. But in a tournament situation where they're ready to go, pop, they punch him and they're sitting down already. I mean, they beat him so quickly that the guy that's obviously stronger or possibly stronger doesn't even have a chance to do anything. Yeah, some people are talking about
SPEAKER_00: like pulling with two arms in same day. Like, I remember myself, I remember you in same day, not one day left, one day right, like competing like five classes.
SPEAKER_00: But not really easy events, you know. And then you go in this table, and then that table, and then you put 90 kilo here, and then they announce you, you put 110 here, and then super heavyweight here, you go left arm there, you know, you go from table to table, you know, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: right but it wasn't it wasn't very taxing on me because we're here again we were talking about in our younger years where we could just sit up and go bang you know it wasn't even harder younger years yes younger years this is what i'm saying you know if you are young i also compete just say like kansas state eight category i mean i hardly sit down you understand i was going there and there there there there there going all the categories
SPEAKER_04: I can remember a day when I was similar to what Devin can do now, and after a tournament, a hard-fought tournament, go up to the after-pooling table and pull everybody that was at the tournament, just one right after the other. I never really feel like I came down in any fatigue at all. Now, one or two matches, and it's like, you know, I get...
SPEAKER_00: I need to find a place to sit. I mean, you get winded, and I just, you know, the lactic acid and all that, you know, it's just different. I don't know what's changed, but it's just not the same. A lot of things. Okay, so yeah, so you have a match with Irakli, and Irakli, as of many others, seeing this as probably the
SPEAKER_00: best uh opportunity of their life you understand like i mean they all are seen that way and i he said that he has so much respect for you and i asked him will this uh respect uh affect his performance in negative way and he said that that is different subject table is different subject and he's really looking forward to bt john this is this is what i understand
SPEAKER_04: and then and then you you made a comment like you know sentence you know you're saying that your destiny is already written or something you know just messing with his head a little bit yeah no yeah i i honestly don't believe that i just thought that would be kind of fun to just throw out there like you it's harder the harder you try mentally have it go through your head the more negative effect it's going to have on you so
SPEAKER_04: I kind of do believe that. Yes, I believe too. I find myself, whenever I try to get a little stronger, a little more revved up or focused or get that sleep when I arrive in Turkey, if I'm mentally trying to do these things, it has a complete negative effect. I don't know. We will see. That category is...
SPEAKER_00: 115 kilo doesn't look super exciting. Sorry. But Devon kind of seems there, you know, just like not much competition. Of course, it's possible to beat him. But 105 kilo, even for Devon. Because for me, Devon is not really, he could be.
SPEAKER_00: super heavy weight he could have been like in the past if he really wanted but after starting age it is not really you really need to push yourself you know for for our tomorrow to grow is much more possible than devon to grow after his 47 you know so what i'm just saying that for me to me 115 kg for devon is the like most natural perfect you know category and then going up is reducing his chance
SPEAKER_04: doesn't mean he cannot become best and then going down to 105 is also reducing his chance because it is he probably is getting a little bit weaker in that 22 pounds everybody would hope that but i i i honestly don't believe that i think he is gaining the weight that he did prepping for levon and now if he had if he loses that weight um
SPEAKER_04: that those tendons are still going to be there. I think he's going to be almost 99% as effective at 220 or 230 than he was at 280. And we'll see. Time will tell. We'll see. Oh, you are saying that at 230 he can be as good as how he performed? I think he's going to be just as good as he was when he was 280.
SPEAKER_04: I kind of disagree with that, but I respect your opinion. What I pulled eight months ago, a year ago at King of the Table when he was 280, 290, 291 versus the guy that I pulled just four or five weeks ago, that guy was way stronger. Yeah, but do you think it's because maybe he's getting healthier by the stem cells and things? Because, I mean, why would you, I mean,
SPEAKER_04: don't know i don't know i would think that you know he would be stronger at 280. i mean there's a lot of guys that i can you know think of that i mean look at brandon ellen i mean he's been doing the power lifting and super strong i mean lifting probably three times what he's lifting right now and he came over to the house when devin was here and he was strongest brian and ellen that i've ever felt and he was you know
SPEAKER_00: But that power in different sports to transfer here is different. He's now lighter than he is that time. Oh, he was way lighter. Yeah. He is lighter, but can he lift the same thing?
SPEAKER_00: that he was so he is getting weaker when he gets he's only getting stronger in arm wrestling because he's still transferring the power but for us we already transferred everything you know i don't think there is no more transfer it isn't because probably he's healthier now that's always been my my feeling and my argument way back when when i you know i
SPEAKER_04: I did the weightlifting for about a year back when I was 20, 21, 22 years old. I had gained 10, 15 pounds. And, you know, I was pretty much doing double in the weight room. And I didn't feel like it translated to my arm wrestling at all.
SPEAKER_04: i mean i was bigger more impressive looking yeah i could i could have told people that i was i was twice as strong as i was last year which in some respects from the weight room i was um but yeah it didn't translate to the table so yeah yeah i mean we we already translated everything but i'm just saying that brandon in his uh what different sport he was doing whenever he lost weight he loses power as well so if he was doing arm resting with the heavy weight
SPEAKER_00: when he was very heavy and he loses weight now. I think that same as in the different sport he was doing, he's losing weight more. It didn't happen. It didn't happen on the arm wrestling table.
SPEAKER_00: no big it is because he is still recording new muscle memory because he's not an armistice he is still a lot to put on because i mean he's still transferring but you transfer devon transfer do you think that is there any empty page on devon's book that to record something about our message no the only thing i might think that it is maybe he's getting healthier that is uh but who knows but what i'm just saying on garber to beat devon at 105 kilo is
SPEAKER_04: more possible than he beating in 150 kilos. This is how I see, or it would need to be Devon at 105 kilos, maybe more possible to beat him in 150 kilos. Of course. I'm just saying that the possibility isn't as huge as, as I think that you would think that it would be. I'm, I'm saying, yes, it's going to be a little bit of a, a little bit of a difference, but not, not monstrous. Okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I still think that if somebody beats Devon, not in super heavyweight, I'm talking about anything down super heavyweight, 105 kilo is more possible with 150. I don't know, maybe you, maybe Ongarbev can gain some.
SPEAKER_04: weight i i i honestly truly believe i don't feel i'm as a as uh effective i don't i don't want to even try to think that i would could gain 15 20 pounds to be 115 kilos to i i you know i would certainly um accept the challenge but i i don't i don't see that extra under five kilo
SPEAKER_04: yeah i'm going to be 105 i'm going to be whatever i'm naturally walking around i mean yeah yeah yeah i feel like i could be more effective if i would you know quit eating the ice cream sundaes before i go to bed and actually you know watch what i eat and be more healthy and and you know um you know cut 10 pounds of this that i walk around with definitely be more you know mobile well how do you see your chances against that 105 kilo both of you 105 kilo
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I think I had just as good a chance as anyone. I mean, I've got enough experience with pulling him and I know where his strengths are and I know what it's going to take to, you know, get that win. I mean, and Evgeny was really close. I mean, there was a couple of times that he's popped him and he, you know, he decided to go for the shoulder roll maybe a little too early. There was a time there in that first match that, you know,
SPEAKER_04: it was really close i mean some people even thought that you know a possible pin so there's a few guys that you know obviously uh have the ability if everything is aligned right to to get a win on devin two with three wins but um you know devin in practice pulling and slow pulling if if there's any doubt at all or he stops a match that he that guy is is uh levels above the rest of the field i mean he's then then then i don't know if there's anybody that can pull with him but
SPEAKER_04: he's still still susceptible to that that that hit you know that that speed that arsenal lab has and the ermys has and um even prudnik i mean i i'm sure he as soon as he gets healed up he's going to be right there ready to try it again i mean he's close enough that that 105 kilo category to me is the most exciting one yeah petrenko is there petromargarit is there you are there
SPEAKER_00: Garboev is there, Irakli is there, Krasimir is there, Devon may come. What? That's somebody that I would love to pull in the future that I, you know. Petro? Petro, yes, absolutely. Petro has incredibly strong wrist power. His coping power is incredible. But his endurance, not sure. If somebody beats him, they have more chance to beat him inside.
SPEAKER_00: then outside because if you remember he didn't only win against you he also beat Revas there he just hook him and beat him like it is not that easy to hook Revas to Morozov also hook him but it was different Revas Revas of today is seriously stronger and bigger but Morozov beat him like boom you know hook he this guy has a wrist power to hook you like you know with his wrist only yeah yeah
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I'd be curious if I could do anything different. I mean, I would probably still approach it the same way I did in the Moldova. I would actually try to top roll him in the first match, get my ass handed to me, and then go, okay, well, maybe he needs right now. Just absorb the hook, you know? Just tell me. April, I can call him and send him directly if you want. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, what does he weigh? He's kind of a shorter guy, right? He's only probably 100, 500, 10 kilo. He's probably not much bigger than that, right?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he just pulled off 100 kilo. He took their fourth or fifth, but in fact, he's the one that sent Krasimir Kostadinov, who won that class, to the B side. Oh, gotcha. He beat him, you know, first start, he was winning position, long match, very long match, he got a foul, or one of them got a foul. And then second start, again, like 20 seconds or something, and then he won, but it was kind of a tough match, and then he lost, you understand?
SPEAKER_00: um i think that his bicep is compared to his forearm is the the weaker i remember him having a really large dominating hand like you know yeah he was couldn't get couldn't get away from him for sure yeah yeah yeah yeah not not only you as you remember also it was
SPEAKER_00: yeah maybe you were not even in good shape you know then you you just come back oh yeah it was yeah i tried to i tried to bounce back that was like two months in i'm trying to bounce back from the first meldoba where i you know just kind of put on a show with travis actually thinking oh i better start arm wrestling a little bit if i'm going about coming back here be part of this probably your shape was as good as your shape when you pull chance show maybe yeah or the way or whatever something like just making a comeback you know a few months training yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah anyway so that's that's incredible category i'm telling you the 105 kg very good one anyway so and again if we talk about directly how do you see your chances to me i will tell the first how i think to me it is very very hard to hook him in my opinion
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. You try to hook him, in my opinion, will not result good for you. My opinion is very clear. You will both go outside. If you both go outside, both of you stays with the flat wrist, you're winning that match because he needs to have full control while you are so much used to with the flat wrist side pressure.
SPEAKER_00: If you top roll him, you're going to beat him. And if he top rolls you, then he's going to beat you. That's simple. The one who will have the risk control will win. But if it is in an equal position, in my opinion, without full risk control, your side pressure is stronger than his. So he needs to have full control against you. This is what I think. Give me one second, Ingen. Yeah. My daughter's calling me. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Hey, so they have a couple of them expired. Oh, expired March. So they're good until March. Oh, 2020, 22. That can't be right. Oh, okay. Well, so then I need to get all three of them redone. Are you sure it's not 23? Okay. Well, let me know and I'll renew them all.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. Okay, I'm doing a podcast. So I need to get off the phone. But yeah, I'll redo them all. Okay. Well, I probably have to do it being in Arizona. Let me be safe. Don't Don't worry about it. I'll do it as soon as I get off of this thing.
SPEAKER_00: or okay or you can or you can try to do it i'll i'll take a picture of my uh my driver's license of course hello performance pancakes guy hello my friends yeah devon was talking about sunday's my friends i'm sorry again excuse me no no it's okay everything's okay my friend you need to need to be sorry all is good we are having here nice nice nice conversation yeah what were we talking about you and iraqli how the match do you agree or do you remember
SPEAKER_00: what I said about the prediction. Roman, SG records. I love John, but my money is on Iraqi stop roll. Of course, because you are Georgian, come on. Yes, I agree. Although I did see some footage of,
SPEAKER_04: david.com pulling directly and you know of course it's practice pulling and there's a little bit of it actually had a super match with right arm but again didn't have super much maybe it wasn't so hard but still you know yeah yeah i mean if i could get directly in a hook it looks like he'd be not easy to beat but i mean i feel like it would be a match that i could win uh but you're right i mean it'll be super super super dangerous and i don't feel like i could probably you know
SPEAKER_00: mean if you could hook him yeah but but to hook him it is not that easy yeah right yeah i think you need to keep his wrist uh flat you know even if even if you cannot fully topple him if he has the wrist like this and then you have like that i think that um we will see we will see the guy is also coming big and strong yeah and he really wants to beat you because
SPEAKER_00: beating john bersink is like meeting you know so he's just probably uh eating drinking waking up sleeping with with youth keep doing it keep doing it keep thinking about it more you the more you mentally you know push yourself the harder it will be to beat me you think that that's how it how it is that oh absolutely he's gonna make himself sick if he keep if he really is in that mode
SPEAKER_04: to try that little extra have you been on same path yeah there's experience you're talking yeah well i know i know it's experience yeah i know it's experience the more the more i think about something like that i mean it's one thing to to act on on motivation of you know of physically doing something but to to mentally try to you know rewind too much no good it's just it's a negative effect it's such a negative effect on on your abilities
SPEAKER_00: but but it is good john that you know we like uh bring best of west and best of east and then together and then not only because bringing them together but many people from west get to know the eastern guys and the eastern guys
SPEAKER_00: get to know the western guys i think that west knew more about the east than east knew more about the west maybe i don't know i'm talking about not guys like you but there are selective people who travel over here from from north america like now we have adam morzinski pauline you know these guys just like corey west you know they are just
SPEAKER_04: Right recently coming yeah yeah. you're it's nice that you're able to bring the cream of the crop of North America, you know, like you said, most of the experience at the Georgians and some of the Europeans have. North American pullers is just the guys that could afford it in the past right, I mean they weren't. Most is. Most is super away than you yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because the lighter guys didn't have so much opportunity. What's that? It's nice that you're exposing them to the better arm wrestling group that exists here in North America. Yeah. But don't you think that John, they are, but listen, the heavyweight Americans or Canadians, you know, they, they travel here and they had this competition, uh, and experience while
SPEAKER_00: The American arm masters only in the lighter weight categories, they only pull with each other. They don't really get in this mix. While we talk about East, we're talking about 10, 15 countries. And these guys, every European championships, every world championships, so twice a year. And also in the past, it was low to true. Three times a year, they were just, and they were learning. They were pulling against each other. They were learning all different type of pullers.
SPEAKER_00: And then they were better and they go home, they do homework, come back. So I am a believer of the competition makes someone better and better and better. So now we bring the lighter Americans here. And I think like Pauline, I think is doing well. Adam already did well, but probably he will even do better. I'm sure to be part of this is just makes all of us, like when I came to US,
SPEAKER_00: First, I came in 96 for the WAF and then early 97, I came there, stayed there five, six years. So more than that. So I competed more, more, more, more. And then I really get better, more I pulled. And because technically Americans were very good and
SPEAKER_00: whenever I pull the heavier categories, it was also physically so tough for me. And then when I go back to World Championships, you know, so then I was technically in strength, you know, I was already good, you know. But in the past, in the past, the more lighter guys were dominant in the World Arena, like Cobra, Dave Patterson, you know, many of them. And later years,
SPEAKER_00: heavy weights, super heavy weights remain to be competitive with the rest of the world, while the lighter weights, little bit behind. Do you agree with this or?
SPEAKER_04: um yeah i guess because they just haven't had the opportunity i guess to show themselves um yeah i mean and it's a lack of of activity in the united states i mean in canada i mean other than the few super matches the promotions that we've had there hasn't been a whole lot in my mind uh just even just open you know double elimination tournaments anymore i mean just the grassroots uh type tournaments aren't
SPEAKER_00: as abundant as they were in the past i i i maybe maybe i'm wrong in that feeling because i don't you know i'm not exposed in the past there was a lot of tournaments here yeah yeah you want more you want more open tournaments where people could get in and yeah and people may think that it's inconsistent what i said about today them to come here and it'd be in the past for me to go there but the times that i went there the lightways were still you know
SPEAKER_00: very good you know like cobra was just going to russia and winning the waffles in the heart of the armistice you know
SPEAKER_04: and yeah so i hope it would be nice to eventually you know have a couple of these versus west in in the in the west because as we've talked in the past i mean it's i think it's a little bit of a difference between you know living in that time zone and then you know getting on an airplane for 20 plus hours in a completely different time zone i i think there's a little bit to be said you know for that so it'd be nice to eventually have them be exposed to that to see how they cope with
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. By the way, we are going to do minimum four qualification events for the East versus West in US, and then one or two qualification events in Canada. But we are not going to take all the winners. All these winners, they will go for a big final. And there, the winners, for sure, with right arm, left arm, we don't give guarantee, but we will check it.
SPEAKER_00: uh four category with right arm and two category with uh no four category for men and two category for women will be given guarantee that i will cover expenses and pay some amount of money and then i will also do the qualification over here and then so there will be six from north america and then six from europe after qualifications and then in a few events probably three events and two matches
SPEAKER_00: know from disqualified at this i will be setting and then again as you said we need to do east versus west over there as well but we need to sit down and talk how we can do it and yeah it will be good i mean as long as our medicine grows it is good you know i mean after it comes to a certain point yeah and sol arun arun said
SPEAKER_00: uh the top two goals on my screen treasure this moment fellas he said thank you my friend anyway so okay john um you you did you have a chance to look at the rest of the matches at the east versus west yeah i've looked at him but yeah you know how my old age memory is it's horrible so yeah okay just like if i tell you
SPEAKER_00: So yeah oh yeah fair okay fair you asked me about ferret and. Corey right down. Oh right arm they're going to pull. yeah they're pulling right arm I thought they were pulling left arm. No left arm corey Miller corey corey West with it. that's what I said okay that's what I thought you were asking me about. No, again, I began to be, I said, can I be in footage. Oh, can I infer. You know the credit right term.
SPEAKER_04: And then, and then I'm going to be rooting for Farad, right? He's, he's, he's old school. Yeah. Yeah. And plus.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, I like Gennady also, but I would think that if Ferid's in top shape and ready, he's got so many more options than Gennady, I think. I think he's, well, I think he's probably better in all aspects, better top roller, better hooker. His endurance. Not anymore hook. Not hook anymore? Yeah, that is why he became very good top roller because it hurts elbow, but he is coming back in hook too.
SPEAKER_00: he first built a good top roll and now he built a good side pressure as well side pressure and top is ready hook is like this looks extremely healthy i mean what is he weighing yeah weight wise under uh he is 308 pounds now wow yeah 120 kilo yeah he's like a tank right now yeah so super exciting yeah people people think that you know he many people doesn't know about him
SPEAKER_00: and some people ask me again you put in ferret with corey west is that enough good good enough to just directly pull against corey and i was like i mean probably you don't know about ferret you know
SPEAKER_04: yeah well yeah that that one i think i think that will be a tougher challenge than his right-handed match corey is is the real deal i mean he's so yeah left-handed geez yeah no um yeah and he just keeps getting better and better quite rapidly so that'll be another exciting so yeah good for you to put that one together yeah yeah yeah yeah um somebody's asking
SPEAKER_00: Remind me who Corey's pulling, right? Corey, right down is Arif Ertem. Okay, so I don't know that guy very well. Oh, I've seen him pull before at your tournaments, but I really don't have any experience. No, he was in the same event with you. He pulled in February against Ermes, and then he pulled against Krasimir. Right, right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So right arm, they will be pulling, and then left arm, Corey will be pulling with Ferit. And, you know, Ferit, when he pulls against you in...
SPEAKER_00: vegas he was about i will tell you how much he was about 260 pounds okay so now he is about 50 pounds heavier but you will see that he is not you saw him there right last time in istanbul yeah he's not really like fat fat but he's just like well built you know so yeah yeah it will be a good match it will be a good match yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_04: And then you are thinking that Ferid is favored against Gennady. Is this how you are thinking? I think so. Yeah, I would hope so, I guess maybe. It's more of a hope than knowing. I really don't have much experience with the new version of Gennady. I mean, we have pulled in the past a little bit back many years ago in Zloty, but yeah, he's a different guy, right? I mean, you can judge him with Dave Chaffee match, with Michael match, with...
SPEAKER_04: The last one was Jerry. He lost, but he wasn't bad match. He was just, he could go either way, you know? Obviously, super strong arm. If you're saying Farad's hook's not quite there yet, then that might be trouble. But, yeah. But can he hook? That is another thing. Can he hook Farad, yeah. And it's tougher on the elbow to me, even when you have a top, you know, have somebody in a good top roll to be able to finish when your flexor's like this. You need elbow, right? Yeah, so...
SPEAKER_00: Maybe he cannot do it this way, but maybe he can do it this way. I mean, you saw his match with Vitaly, right? He toppled Vitaly, and Vitaly was still effective with that. He was on brachial radialis. But the question is, can Gennady still pull that way? Because he also got injured some time ago while he's trying to pull that way. So we all are
SPEAKER_00: getting older and with chronic injuries and limited, you are not the only one. I'm trying to get rid of all the little aches and pains that it is about getting stronger, right? Yeah, it's funny how we go full circle and just wish that we were healthy again and not. Yeah. Nate is asking you, John, what adjustments would you make against Ongarbeyev in a rematch?
SPEAKER_04: I would be just as aggressive and try to do exactly what I did in the first match. And if I ended up getting caught out of position off the ready go, if I felt like I was just, it was just a timing issue, I will let it, I would let it go.
SPEAKER_04: You're not going to burn yourself like this. I would not fight from a bad position or a losing position because in my mind, that was what ruined me with my Angravaia match that I struggled thinking I could still win even though my hand was kind of out of position. And I felt like it was really close to like I could still almost maybe pull a Devin and maybe get a win on this.
SPEAKER_04: um when i failed to do it then it was you know it was i was done i mean there's just no way for me to recuperate in whatever 90 seconds two minutes the rest between the rounds and a super match like that with someone
SPEAKER_04: that's in the shape that he's in and the age that he is. So it's, yeah, my approach would just be try to do, just try to be alert and have the timing down. And I think I had plenty of strength to beat him if all of that goes well. And if it doesn't go well, then lay down, you know, get a restart, get on the other side of the table, you know, make sure all my shots are fresh shots, not shots of,
SPEAKER_04: I'm not saying that it'd be, it's still going to be, it's still razor thin close, I think, but I think, you know, I told you, I felt like we could have redone it the next day and I think I could have, you know, possibly beat him. I just, I felt that like I was, I was in the match. I was that close. I was as strong, if not stronger. I just needed to, um, do a few, few little adjustments to make it right. Um,
SPEAKER_00: John, I remember after Gennady beat both Michael and Dave Chaffee and we were eating in a restaurant and you said that Jerry will most likely beat Gennady. And I said, do you really believe that? He said, just watch tomorrow. And especially if Gennady tries to topple him. And then it went exactly as you said. And so my question is that Jerry, like it is,
SPEAKER_00: very very hard to beat him only with top row if you do not know how to do the transition at the end like
SPEAKER_00: Jerry, I have seen you. You caught him here, waited, waited, waited, waited, waited, and he won. But do you think that there are, like, not many people can do that? Like, how dangerous Jerry is against the top horse? Yeah, no, I mean, if you can do that, that's definitely the long road. It's the hardest way to beat Jerry. If you let Jerry get...
SPEAKER_04: behind his arm at all with a broken wrist, he is extremely, extremely difficult to get out of that. The better approach is to stand square, be brave, and, you know, and kind of hit to the side and take him off center a little bit, not in a hook, but with kind of a, you know, keeping his wrist flat and not really running away from him so he can dump his wrist underneath you.
SPEAKER_04: So you need to block him with the downside of your hand wrist sideway? Yeah, and just knock him off center just a little bit so he can't really get that up and down tricep push on your arm. Then it becomes much more manageable.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, yeah, once Jerry gets there, there isn't any, there's very few people. I mean, maybe LeVon will be able to do it, but if LeVon gets in there, I wouldn't be surprised if he has a devil of a time getting him out of there. You are saying that if Jerry catches LeVon in this position, LeVon on his brachial radialis, and then Jerry is there, even it would be hard for LeVon. I think so. I think it's difficult for anybody. So, yeah. I understand. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, yeah so if your hand is if jenny's putting pressure from downside here, and then he makes you like grenades like this and then catches you on your.
SPEAKER_04: Raquel Radial is only, it is very, very hard to lift him from there. So that you are saying that someone needs to do everything right from the start to not to come to that point. Yeah, I mean, he's an intimidating body to be facing. He's so big, he's so tight, and he's staying so close to him that it's just in your brain to try to pull him away from that and run away. But that's...
SPEAKER_04: I think that's a difficult road to take with Jerry. It's going to be a lot harder on you if you do that versus, you know, staying square and brave with him and just trying to match the top position with good side pressure and not so much back pressure. You know, don't run away from him. Stay square and try to match him side for side to get him just knocked off a little bit so he can't get that tricep on your arm.
SPEAKER_04: Um, whatever happened to the match with, uh, yeah, well, Hermes is still questionable. That's still going to be in the future. Right. We'll see. And how, how did you think about that match? I think it'll be a lot tougher. I mean, Hermes, Hermes felt Dave and was able to pull that off with Dave, but I think that'll be a lot harder move to pull off with, um, Jerry, of course. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Michael Cloden on Garbaev. Good match, huh? Yeah, I think on Garbaev obviously is going to probably get the hand advantage. I don't know if he'll put himself in a bad spot where he continues to try to pull back, getting the hand advantage with Mike's pronation and kind of back pressure King's move.
SPEAKER_04: That puts a lot more pressure for me personally when I'm trying to still topple that. And I also worry that Angrabayev does not have a shoulder press to finish the match with Michael. So I suspect that Michael- Have you seen his match with Kurdesha? No. Just watch his match with Kurdesha. Kurdesha toppled him and Angrabayev beat him.
SPEAKER_00: with a oh yeah this was about a year ago or two or three years ago yeah about three years ago but but he is able to do that i know i know i would never expect that that you know could that's a couple of him and then then uh on garba is pulling without wrist and then beating him i know i've never never yeah does he does he possess that
SPEAKER_04: or will he die trying to do what he feels is the natural way to go, which is his outside top role hit hit. Are you sure that are you sure that Michael will be the one that will win the hand bottle battle? I think I don't even if he doesn't win it initially, I think
SPEAKER_04: that rise or consistent pressure that Mike has, being able to lock his arm, will fatigue Pergali's hand out eventually. So you are saying that Ongarwe cannot
SPEAKER_04: And I think doing that makes it worse with Michael. I feel like once you secure a cup with Michael and get his wrist, you need to move your elbow forward and almost protect it like this. Yeah, you pull that way, yeah. But like some others, like Gennady climb, you know. Keep climbing, keep climbing. Yeah, yeah. For me, that puts a lot more pressure on my own hand to have it eventually go over. Yes, yes, yes, yes. You want to...
SPEAKER_00: uh continuous constant pressure on the opponents per native you want to and not something not so much cup but but almost protect your cup with with you know bringing your elbow forward like this then so you go yeah yeah i understand so you are saying that michael is favorite in this match i think mike in my mind michael will be the favorite to win this with
SPEAKER_00: And Michael losing some weight, but you are a believer that you don't believe that thing, right? I don't think it's going to be a huge hell of a lot of difference. I mean, yeah, mentally, I guess it maybe affects, might affect Mike, but I mean, as long as he doesn't question himself, it just goes in there. If Michael wins this one, then 105, 115, and super heavyweight all will be Western guys. American, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. I guess, I guess I won't get a shot at the one Oh five class. If Mike ends up prevailing over on a goodbye. Right. So, well, I still have to get to know why not? Why not? Why not? I mean, we do Michael, Michael hold the title, but that's fine with me. I mean, I'd like to see Michael pull, um, you know, obviously, um, we'll see how my match with directly turns off, but, um, there's a few other matches with Mike. If he decides to stay, stay in that light, that would be.
SPEAKER_00: But John, why not West versus West? We do East versus East here. Yeah, sure. I'd be pulling Michael for sure out in Istanbul. It seems kind of crazy for us. We'll be jumping on airplanes 20 hours to pull for a supermatch. But sure, I'd do it. Some guys come with eight hours, nine hours direct place. Too bad that you leave the other side more. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And okay, the reason I asked about Jerry was because of the sweat goal. Did you have chance to check Zetkov's, Georgi's right arm in Moldova? You know that they were gonna, people always bring me that, oh, this is the guy that Travis crushed, but that guy's left arm was like injured. He wasn't even pulling. He's supposed to pull Travis' right arm and Travis hurt his chest. And then they had to pull left arm.
SPEAKER_00: not his right arm was the the one that was ready at that time and but did you see him after push you know in in uh moldova i didn't i don't remember the after pools i just remember the guy was freaking huge huge yeah so um but yeah let's yeah but because of his style you think
SPEAKER_04: not so much chance against Jerry. I don't know what his style is, to be quite honest with you. And I haven't really seen him pull, but yeah, but if he's doing that, he's not going to be Jerry. He needs, he needs to almost have a kind of a confident sweeping. Yeah. Now he's training side pressure. Side pressure move right off the go, right off the start. If he's, if he's, if he runs away at all, it's going to be a bad day against Jerry. Yeah. And then the guy has his angles often.
SPEAKER_00: know it'll be a bad day so he needs a good good side push yeah and another one i'm going to ask you you have been following samusha you have seen him right if he matches people with a little bit hey of course yeah and now he's gonna pull with craig tuller
SPEAKER_04: Craig too. Yeah. Yeah. He's called Craig's arm is healed up from this match with Brandon. Holy shit. I mean, I imagine he's probably going to have a few little stingers still left in his army. Hopefully he's just resting between now and then. So, uh, Craig, Craig has such an explosive outside hit. Um, I suspect that that match will either go really quick for Craig or, you know, Craig at all. People think that people think that Brandon beat Craig. So,
SPEAKER_00: David is going to dominate Craig, but David is not a top roller. The way that Brandon beat was mostly for back pressure, pronators. David is just trying to cup and beat the guy, you know, and then it may not be that easy to do that against Craig, but we will see. It is also a different weight category, 187. Craig, there was 200 pounds category at Michael's event, yeah. And then
SPEAKER_04: Rustem Babae versus Pauline. Well, you know the kind of feelings I have for Rustem. He's the man, right? I mean, he's tough for even the super heavyweights to beat.
SPEAKER_04: Paul's going to definitely have his work cut out for him. I mean, I'm not saying that Paul has absolutely no chance because I think he's strong enough with his outside pull if he can catch Rustem with, you know, get his hand flat somehow. But Rustem is so explosive and so effective at setting up high and just, you know, coming crashing down on the wrist that, you know,
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. There's not, there's not many people, um, no matter what the weight that can pull with Rustem inside. So, um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But whenever I look at Paul, he gave me a very, very hard time to you inside. Yeah. And he also hook and beat Rambat. And we are so, uh, last month, the way he beat Gamtenadze, the Gamtenadze is a world champion.
SPEAKER_00: and the guy has wins over ongarbe over latin and some other guys in the past but um paul to me looks i mean paul's match against paulo to me doesn't matter because paulo probably after the way in the guy was probably 250 pounds while this match is going to be a 209 totally different different category so i don't know paul is you know rustem is known with his
SPEAKER_00: explosiveness and to me paul also very explosive i don't know you have better experience than me of course yeah it'll just be different i don't think paul's experienced any kind the kind of pressure that
SPEAKER_04: James Forrest, Norcal PTACC, that Russell is going to put on his arm it's going to be straight on his wrist into his bicep more than cup sweeping across the table to the pin pad so. James Forrest, Norcal PTACC, it's just unusual rustem is so small and so compact that it's just different so hopefully hopefully Paul can deal with it. Paul Fain, Norcal PTACC, But you think that is really hard much.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, I think it's very hard match for Paul. Yeah. Especially X and I, if, if Paul would have beat Pablo and I said, oh yeah, no, he's, he's right. He keeps getting better. He's but, but that, that kind of shocked me actually, to be quite honest, but it did look like Pablo maybe put pressure on Paul's hand more than, than, than just sweep, you know, hook. I don't know. It almost looked like he cut. Yeah. He had, he had the pronator and went like sideways when, when, when Paul catch him in hook round two.
SPEAKER_00: if i were him i would just wait there instead you know he started moving like this and he lost and then when he went to strap on round three i thought he was gonna go inside and then he toppled try topple he lost if he would have gone to inside he would stop him for sure i don't know if he could beat him but yeah and also paulo looked really big there you know yeah yeah i saw i saw his after pulls with left arm with cory
SPEAKER_04: So I don't think that Paolo is in a good shape anymore. No, Paolo's in really good shape. So maybe that's the case. Maybe then Paul can bounce back from that.
SPEAKER_04: rustum a match like i said it's all going to depend on how great a shape rustum's in though but i think even rustum walking around four months he's coming with four months training after some breaks but you know all the muscle memory is there you know he may not be in super shape but i'm sure he will be in very good shape right and and the extended rest may may have done him more good than than you know than
SPEAKER_00: yes yes yes yes sometimes sometimes you heal up you know yeah injuries healed up yeah you're you're brand new like you come back you know you didn't come back brand new but i mean you are every day we see you yeah my my my rest was way too extended and it included way too much alcohol and apart yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then let's go do you know barbara you don't know right so from slovakia
SPEAKER_00: you will see there and you you will be impressed you know when you see her she is about probably six one six two and she is probably my opinion i don't want to i mean do wrong you're talking about woman weight you don't want to talk you know wrong but she may be 250 pounds you know and she is you know like really athletic she's thick she's strong and then
SPEAKER_00: she doesn't arm muscle like classic woman. She arm muscle like with like wrist. Um, I have seen her beating some world level, 155 pound guys look in their face and beating them like this, you know? And so she's very strong. She's gonna pull with Gabriela. Oh, okay. Wow. And the girl is only 22 years old or something like that. Yeah. And I kind of think that Gabriela,
SPEAKER_00: better beat her now a year later it may not be possible because she's so young but when you see her you will realize that she is just like incredible you know yeah but big long levers if she's not she's she probably is going to be at a be the underdog against gabrielle right it will be very tough match i won't be surprised with anything
SPEAKER_00: in her favor okay but i i also think that gabriella can beat her too you know yeah and another one we have chance show versus david araboli david araboli you probably do not know much about him he is about he's shorter than sundries much shorter uh but three years ago he was at the level of sundries i don't know his level he's the training partner of levan and directly
SPEAKER_04: and the guy was doing translated for them translation he was doing yeah and that that is the guy yeah and yeah he's gonna look at really good you're gonna have to find a really strong opponent to beat chance now i think it's he's he's i think he's definitely been under the radar for a while now he's definitely underrated he's probably a lot better than most people think yeah i agree john we also have another incredible match
SPEAKER_00: Do you know Alijan Murado? This guy, Alijan Murado, used to be 80 kilo world champion. And his normal weight around like 200 pounds. And this year he didn't compete in Kazakhstan nationals. And at the Worlds, there was only one spot open, and it was the super heavyweight.
SPEAKER_00: And they announced him like 101, 111 or something. But he told me his weight was like maximum 95. And he dominated the super heavyweight. And he won the gold. Yeah. And this guy also, two years ago, competed in the Lotoshino tournament. Maybe you remember Lotoshino. In Russia, they were organizing. And he won the gold there where Morozov couldn't make finals.
SPEAKER_00: So his left arm is incredible. He is going to pull for the world title against Oleg Petrenko for 105 kilo. Oh, okay. Wow. Yeah. Oleg's left arm is also very strong. He beat Daddycat in 2019, his low kick. And now, him and Alijan Murado. I would suggest you to just follow that match.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, well, Oleg looked unstoppable against Zurab. Lefty, I don't know if it was hurting or what, but that almost looked painful. He was so dominant. Yeah, and another interesting match, Porkchop versus Zurab. Exciting. Well, let's see how good Porkchop is. I know Devin's been talking him up quite a bit lately, and rightly so, probably. I mean, he's been training under...
SPEAKER_04: a very strong group for a while now. Exciting. I mean, but I don't think I'd want to pull Zoram in a hook. So as we've mentioned before, I think Zoram and Todd Hutchins would be a good match. So Porkchop will definitely have his work cut out for him if he's going to go inside wrist to wrist with that man because that's the toughest road to take with him. It is not that easy to hook Chen Shou, right?
SPEAKER_00: that's why zurab was just yeah no yeah no chance yeah no chance hit him perfectly i mean just yeah yeah yeah i remember you trying to it was the beginning of you but when you tried to hook chance round one in the second start he you also couldn't who couldn't hook him so even even katashins he is naturally you know hook he he beat him but he still i mean lost his wrist and everything you know
SPEAKER_00: he beat him because he protected his own pronators. So when chance was trying to go, his wrist was going like this. So if chance can fix here, it can be dangerous for a lot of people. You know, this, this is what my opinion. Yeah. People, people underestimate same, but I was, when I said this match, people were like, oh, why did you set this match up? He's going to kill him. And I'm like every, every, every, every time the subject is there, people are, I didn't, why did you set this match? He's going to kill him. And I was like, if I know arm wrestling,
SPEAKER_00: don't think he's gonna kill him i don't know maybe he beat him but i don't think he's gonna kill him the way that he's pulling you know so it is just like a true site to just jump into chance because he's gonna just you know beat you even you take his wrist he has the pronator he still has that that side pressure just imagine how it is when he has the hook up you know you're just diving inside of him you know yeah
SPEAKER_04: No big difference big difference about your ability to go side pressure when your hands like this versus like that right you. yeah yeah yeah. Really difficult to generate any kind of side pressure with your hand up right to the ceiling. yeah yeah yeah anyway, so these are the matches and we cannot cannot use our open writing that he's going to just dominate, he will not be even close and you also see that way or.
SPEAKER_04: They say that Porkchop is just going to go right through Zahram? Yeah. I don't think so. Yeah, I don't think so. I don't think so. I mean, it'd be very impressive if Porkchop is on the level of, obviously, he needs to be on a little higher level than Ron Bath. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I mean, it's possible. I think he may have more force power that way.
SPEAKER_04: In technical aspect, I don't know about that. I think what made Ron somewhat successful against Zorab was that even though Ron doesn't really possess a top role, he was able to still kind of pull a little bit outside. So if Porkchop is completely just going power, power, wrist to wrist and trying to out, going to try to out drag Zorab, I think that's going to feel like pulling Todd Hutchins. Like I said, I think that's, that's going right into the full, full power of the man. So.
SPEAKER_04: yeah they will say that he can ask if if he don't yeah but that top roll has to be you need to know in top roll as well if you are so open when you are toppling the guy can still it can't be a slow top roll reserve he'll he'll he'll jam you like he like jerry can jam and that'll make it tough also so it's kind of a fine line of how you need to hit him i understand i understand yeah
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, John, you have you have we have been here for one hour and five minutes. We know we are here for one hour and five minutes. So last words. And so you have one month and you have after this match, you have the Dennis Topenko match. And you both signed, you both signed. And how do you see this match?
SPEAKER_04: Well, I guess I hope that I can survive a Reckley. I haven't quite decided how, what I'm gonna navigate this the next four, five, six, seven weeks. I got the guys come over today to pull. We're gonna pull this week. We're gonna pull next week. Typically I take two weeks off from pulling. I don't know if I'll do that knowing that I've got Dennis in four or five weeks after a Reckley.
SPEAKER_04: um but do you don't see that the iraqi match also part of the preparation training yeah no well that's that's my thought that do i just take a risk and keep training and only take maybe one week off before east versus west and and and then try to try to you know obviously you know
SPEAKER_00: James Meeker- Do my best, but try to almost treat that as like a you know just another really good hard training. James Meeker- I think that you should do what you should do I don't think that you should change anything. James Meeker- Because. James Meeker- Because you're being. James Meeker- More rested well rested.
SPEAKER_00: and perform better can be more beneficial than going there tired. And then maybe that will put you in a bad position that then you will not even like mentally and physically, I don't think that it will be a good investment, you know? Yeah, I think that sometimes taking one week extra off can make you totally recover and just maybe even, I mean, you know that we just talked about it, that, you know, sometimes you train, train, train, train so hard,
SPEAKER_04: and then you a little bit rest, and then you heal everything, and then you can see that you are now strong. You mentally kind of mess with me a little bit, knowing that I'm not any more prepared to arm wrestle Dennis than I would be to arm wrestle Reckley, because no matter how the Reckley match goes,
SPEAKER_04: You know it typically takes me two weeks after a hard fought super match like that to recover before I even think about put my arm back up on the table and then two weeks later is Dennis so. From a regulated Dennis i'm probably probably. You have more than one month, you have more than one month right today.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's the 21st of January, and then it will be either the end of February or the beginning of March. So four weeks? Is that four weeks? But if it is beginning of March, then it's five weeks. Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. But if it's March 21st, like what they're proposing. No, no, no. Even if it is end of February, it's still five weeks. Because January is 31 days. 10 days there, just say on 25th of February. I don't know what's the weekend of that, but it's still...
SPEAKER_00: 35 days five weeks and if you make it beginning of the march first week then it will be even six weeks okay so i can get so the minimum time you have five weeks maximum time you will have six weeks after the lightning match yeah yeah right i mean it's of course up to you but i mean
SPEAKER_04: you know even i yeah yeah like i said it's not going to be a lot of a lot of training between now and then it's surprising that i i thought i i i survived the oleg match unscathed but um about a week and a half two weeks later i was like oh yeah no i'm still achy why am i still achy yeah but is it because he put so much joint pressure with the iraqi match it will not be like that because iraqi either will take your wrist or you will take his wrist
SPEAKER_00: when when two topples are going but when someone like jerry or oleg petrenko you pull even you put them in bad position the fight is not over but but it actually will never put the same type of pressure that you know or like or like put so i don't think that that match maybe if you both go in like this and then it may be but i don't think it will hurt because the pressure that they are putting like this is much stronger than this kind of pressure in my opinion you know yeah
SPEAKER_04: I'm not, you know, like I said, I'm going to just have an open mind and, you know, have it fall how it falls. I mean, I can't worry about it. I know, like I said earlier, I know that worrying about things just makes things worse. So just take it as it comes. Yeah, but I think that technically, do you think that technically Iraq is more difficult than Dennis?
SPEAKER_04: Or, you know, Dennis is slower. I feel directly is in a better position to make it. So I'm going to, I, if he beats me, I would feel unsatisfied. Um, Dennis, I'll feel, I think I'll feel satisfied one way or the other. I think with the Dennis match, I'll, I'll be able to, um,
SPEAKER_04: to, to go full, full bore, full strength. And if he just powers me up, I'll just say, okay, well, he's just definitely been a better spot right now and stronger than me. Uh, I think that it'll be more satisfying directly. I worry that, you know, it could be like, just a, just a disappointment of like, I just could not get, I just couldn't get in the match. You know, I couldn't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the thing. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I hope, hopefully that won't be the case, hopefully get a slap in the face and a couple cups of coffee and you know, whatever I could. You know yeah yeah. The possibility that you will give your everything to Dennis matches higher than that everything is enough or not is different days, but you know with me directly, you may not be able to.
SPEAKER_00: get in the match, as you said, to apply what you have with Dennis, I think you will apply everything you have enough or not it's all about the power, but whenever you talk about exactly some speed is involving some like extraordinary top rolling skill is you know there. yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I'd like to think even if Baraka can take me out of position that he doesn't possess, you know, the side pressure to beat me like he beat, you know, who was his last teammate? Oh, Marcio and then Lachlan. I mean, Lachlan, I kind of understood that match because Lachlan just couldn't quite get his hand to even be engaged in the match. But Marcio, it was impressive, his match with Marcio, that he was able to just, you know, blast your Marcio as easily as he did.
SPEAKER_00: We'll see. Yeah. But it is not an opponent to underestimate, right? Absolutely not, of course. No, yeah. Because some people are just thinking that, you know, the guy is like a joke and, you know, like, oh, why this matches the one set, you know. That's not the case. You may very well win, but there is a possibility, serious possibility, that he may give you trouble as well, yeah. No, I know how hard it is to top roll Todd Hutchins.
SPEAKER_00: John Gerstle, The way he did, and he was able to even you know, open up todd's hand so. John Gerstle, I know he's got. John Gerstle, Definitely capable top roller. John Gerstle, yeah anyways john Thank you very, very much for being. John Gerstle, A part of. John Gerstle, yeah Thank you and then hope to see you next month just take care of yourself very well. John Gerstle, We want to see you. John Gerstle, Longer longer a few more years minimum. All right.
SPEAKER_04: I'm playing with the idea of maybe showing up a day earlier than I normally do, if that's okay with you. Yeah, just come. Rest well, my friend. Rest well. Well, I'm thinking about taking the full week off, and I want to go up to Salt Lake. This might be bad for me too, but I got to live my life away from arm wrestling a little bit. So I'm planning on going up to Utah and doing a bunch of snowmobiles. Don't do so much physical exercise.
SPEAKER_04: helpful for me and not hurt me so just relax just relax and let me know uh when you're coming when you buy the ticket and then then i can i can do the reservation yeah yeah so it might be a wednesday night instead of a thursday night so we'll have an extra data to get ready and acclimate to the turkey time zone one one one last thing how is the shoulder it do you feel shoulders
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. And it might be my own fault because I'm, um, I'm been hopeful that the exosomes and the stem cells are gonna do their thing. And so I've been, um, going through the, the, the, you know, massaging it with the, uh, lacrosse ball and, and really doing a lot of different exercises and stretches more than I have. I've kind of given up on it and just decided that, um, the best thing to do is just kind of leave it alone. But yes, yes, yes. I agree. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: therapy okay and i'm gonna i'm gonna go through all the steps to try to you know stretch it and get good blood flow to that area and massage and so it's it's very tender right now so um yeah i think the radical radical changes are no good small by small is better yeah just like do something and see the result do something instead of doing a lot then you may you may even make it worse i hope not yeah thank you thank you once again john and see you next month my friend
SPEAKER_00: All right, take care, Ingen. Thanks again. Thank you. Thanks to everyone who watched us. Yeah, thanks, everybody.
