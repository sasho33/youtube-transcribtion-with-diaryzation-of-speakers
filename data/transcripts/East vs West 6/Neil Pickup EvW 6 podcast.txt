SPEAKER_01: Hello, Engin Turbo. Hello, GB19. Hello, Bagia. Hello, guys. Hello, Richard. Good afternoon to you. Good evening to me.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm fine. A little bit tired. I'm kind of getting exhausted. Because the last event was only like between these two events, there is only two months. And after this one, we have some more time for the April. And I really need to rest.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Ismail. Good evening. Don't forget to give. Thank you, Richard. Thank you. Hello, Victor. Yes, I am tired. But a lot of things to do.
SPEAKER_00: neil pickup is here when neil is coming here to chat or i go usually to his channel to chat uh i don't feel so much tired anymore we talked about our mustang and then i i'm not tired anymore hello hello neil get the boat engine
SPEAKER_00: that that is your design yeah you're gonna bring that with you right to me 100 hanging yeah yeah i'll bring the shirt you just concentrate on the bolts on okay that's what i saw that's what we need do you want me to um build that thought and then we actually do that i'm assuming that that that's really what we need to do yeah we should get the boat
SPEAKER_04: select crew, like five Europeans, and just get on it. I mean, it's quite interesting now, isn't it? Because when we started the whole get the boat thing, it started as a bit of a joke. But funnily enough, you've brought it to reality, haven't you? With East versus West. It's the other way. It's the Americans. They ain't coming. Nobody fancied the trip on the boat. So they're all like, I don't need this anymore. I don't have to take that out.
SPEAKER_00: you told me to get the boat to go there yeah in fact you know we made the boat them to them to be here i i think we at some point now it'd just be a good trip when i just fill it up with europeans and get over there have a bit of fun yeah so how have you been my
SPEAKER_04: charismatic friends well i don't know about that i've been all right mate i've um as you know i've had a few health issues which have been still not resolved 100 they're not going to be resolved to be honest it's not uh it's more manageable than more more managing than resolving really so um but there were there it's a difficult thing i have a certain cell disorder which i've had for a few years
SPEAKER_04: which is an autoimmune cell disorder. There's nothing you can do about it. It's one of those things. When it comes, it comes. When it doesn't, it doesn't. As I say, it can't be eradicated, but hopefully it can be managed. I had a bit of an issue with that pre-Christmas. I think about probably eight weeks, nine weeks pre-Christmas, I got COVID for the second time.
SPEAKER_04: And I started to cough blood, weirdly enough, which is very disturbing when you start. It messes with you. It's very concerning when that happens. But I started to cough blood and then more blood. And the doctors didn't know why. And so I was in and out of hospital with that.
SPEAKER_04: um that thankfully is starting to resolve itself now still no real answers truth be known but about bits of things done to try and find out what was going on there still not resolved but are definitely starting to to feel a little bit better so that's good in many ways um and it
SPEAKER_04: You know, onwards and upwards, mate. 2023, new year. Last year was a pretty challenging year. A member of my immediate family had cancer, which was, again, very... Anybody who's been through that, anybody who's sort of has been through that with a family member knows about that.
SPEAKER_04: uh that again is very it's very disturbing it's very concerning um you feel pretty helpless around that scenario because there's nothing you can do uh it's pretty much just one of those things with uh you you you gotta take every day as it comes and and try your very best to keep thinking positive thoughts um and and but it but it does unsettle you it doesn't nerve you so all those things together a combination of things we're we're sort of uh
SPEAKER_04: everyday life or have been my everyday life for uh for a significant period of time so you're just trying to keep you keep your head on and keep rolling forward best you can mate you know everybody's got challenges in life and i had a few at that time yeah um i want to ask you you i'll say invested like your life into our message you can say that way when you just turn and look at back um
SPEAKER_04: Do you ever regret? No, no, I don't think so. Um, hindsight's a wonderful thing, isn't it? You know, with hindsight, a lot of things may change and a lot of times you'll think to yourself, oh, well, I'll do this different. Uh, I would do that differently. I would, I would do this differently, but no, I feel, um,
SPEAKER_04: I've given my life to arm wrestling, but I also feel like it's given me a great deal that's enhanced my life as well. And I think arm wrestling as a sport does that for everyone that is involved in it. There's an enormous amount of good that comes from arm wrestling and enormous camaraderie. If people say to me,
SPEAKER_04: what what are your most prized elements in your arm wrestling career you know was it european championship wins world championship wins was those the things that you prize most maybe at the time yes at the time i'll never forget the day in italy where uh i was out stood on the lake you remember that i was just looking out over the lake and you came down the stairs that morning and uh
SPEAKER_04: We both didn't say a goddamn thing, but we just stood on the lake. We both won the gold the day before, which is what you go for. You commit your life to becoming world champion. And when you're world champion the morning after the event, when you've done that, it feels incredible. And at the time, it matters immensely to you. But you know, the funny thing is,
SPEAKER_04: When you look back, it's not that that you remember, actually. It's the fun with the people that arm wrestle. It's the fun with the friends you make. The amount of... This isn't cliched either. I don't want to sound like it's, you know, save the world and all the cliche stuff. Really, I mean it. The best times I've had in the sport have been when you've been part of an event
SPEAKER_04: And it's all of the things that go around the event. You know what I mean? It's kind of a weird thing. I mean, we've just started... I restarted Arm Wars, got that back off the shelf after WAL had to roll it up and to try to inject some venom back into the scene, very much like yourself, mate, with East versus West and other people with other major promotions. The idea behind it was to...
SPEAKER_04: and pick up the bottom and run with it you know to try and create interest in the sport again and arm wars i've done it various different ways i wanted to experiment and do things a little differently this time and i'm committed to doing that but because of the corvid situation i did an event called reality check which was at the arnold classic
SPEAKER_04: big event we had thousands of people at the crowd big name pullers um a lot of issues with it just in terms of because we're just coming out of lockdown and there was enormous amount of issues with that everything that went wrong could have gone wrong uh we had we had arm wrestlers getting covered literally when they were at the airport they tested positive i mean mindagus teresatis and he was in a battleground so that made things challenging and i came up with the concept called the iron house
SPEAKER_04: which is effectively like the ultimate fighter so it's just guys in a house um and it is it is magnificent engine i mean i mean it is really good it's amazing we did the iron house one and then i changed public demand a little bit but people say no we really want this live show element we want this to happen and um i changed it for iron house two that was a mistake
SPEAKER_04: so i'm going back i'm retracing my steps and iron house three it's just it's just a house no no nothing the only guys in there are the referees and the competitors nobody else and it's completely behind closed doors everybody that was there everybody that did the original iron house one knows what i'm talking about it was just different it was just and it encapsulated the very best of arm wrestling for me where it's just you and other like-minded guys that are obsessed with the game
SPEAKER_04: it's not about crowds and it's not about titles and it's not it's about it's about the ex that experience it's about being there on the day and and just encapsulating yourself within the sport and that yeah it's something unique and again it's something unique it's a special thing and i think the big thing is at the moment the the since lockdown the sport has changed look at east versus west for christ's sake if you'd have taken
SPEAKER_00: breath three years ago and look at where you are now and what's coming up would you feel like this i want to say something about it like you were um a few of us you remember we were um like like east usually when we are pulling east usually uh represented those mostly those old soviet countries
SPEAKER_00: in our time yeah because it was still fresh that they were and then um talking about ukraine and then the the all those like georgia and russia kazakhstan you know arm wrestling superpowers we were more like you know like uh we could communicate with each other in english and i'm talking about that time yeah and if you owe us we were successful
SPEAKER_00: against the the eastern colors you know correct and there wasn't many of us with your very killing top role you know you were very good but you know you got injured yeah and your left wasn't as good as your right no my left only came good when i got hurt on the right i never i understand but she was on the left when i when i got hurt yeah but he never became he never was the same as your right and so you're right yeah okay my point is different my point is
SPEAKER_00: So you got injured and you quit. You understand? Like you were not, you were not so again, obsessive. I need to win the wars. So that time you started that, the Eurosport events, you remember? Yeah. So whenever you, uh, like it is in you, you love so much, you couldn't continue as, as you like as an arm master because of the injury. So you,
SPEAKER_00: That had to go somewhere else, you understand? Yeah, it did. Many, many other things. So what I'm just saying that I competed my, like I competed 2018 Worlds, I won, then Zloty I won, and then pulled a few super matches, then pandemic started. But what I'm just saying, there was an opportunity because some people says that,
SPEAKER_00: East versus West became successful because some other organizations because of the pandemic. So, but they need to understand one thing. When no one else was organizing, I was one of them that they stepped up, you understand? Yeah. And did something for the community, you understand? It is never was my intention to become a professional promoter. Maybe if you remember before East versus West, I also did the best 78 kilo
SPEAKER_00: events in istanbul you remember right the super matches between sasho iraqi so what i'm just saying that i i arm wrestling is in like i maybe i shouldn't say that way but in dna is that you know you do something else you just need to like as an authority or as a this or that innocent so we have so much in us that we also after a point then if we can't do this as we used to
SPEAKER_00: then we do something else for the sport because we have what it takes to promote the sport because of our love, because of our experience, because of our knowledge. This is not to show off or something. I'm just saying that the same thing happened with you.
SPEAKER_04: long ago long ago because you suffered that serious injury uh also and my left i got told that but i got i got told that um the the surgeon that did my last joint rebuild about three joint rebuilds and the guy that did it the last time a guy called kamanani who was a great guy very very straight talking
SPEAKER_04: no nonsense guy you know very very straight-talking individual and he said i said look you know what what's the situation how bad is the damage and he said look it's bad you've damaged it very badly um he said we've done extensive work he said now we've repaired it i said can i come back and he said no he said you can arm wrestle i said where will i be at and he said
SPEAKER_04: Best case, 70% to 80%. Maybe it's 85%. He said, I don't know, but it's 70% to 80% of what you were. He said, but it's not really about that, Neil. It's more about we can't do that again. He said, what you've got to know is that the manner in which we've done this and the nerve damage and the issues, if you do that again, you'll be crippled. And a crippled right arm is not good.
SPEAKER_04: That would be bad. And it gives you a reality check. It gives you a like, whoa, moment.
SPEAKER_04: and the thing that i thought at the time well i've got a lot of knowledge in other areas i was working with some big promotions at the time obviously i was working with with ufc is working with giants live and working with with other people that i've worked with another big fight promotions k1 and the like and the thing is within that period of time you amass a certain amount of knowledge about promoting and about how the inner workings of television and other elements and i thought
SPEAKER_00: why can i not redirect myself into doing promotion into trying to make the sport that i love the most something different something special something unique when you were pulling we were pulling we have never been only an arm master we were already already you know i was doing the world rankings we were a lot you know i mean you remember everything you know we have geneva 1992.
SPEAKER_04: When I gave people a talk, I did a little talk at the Congress, and everybody laughed at me when I said that arm wrestling really is done incorrectly for a higher level. At that time, there used to be a sweater. I've still got the sweater somewhere. Arm wrestling in the Olympics. And all about everything was arm wrestling in the Olympics. And I said, the biggest issue that arm wrestling's got is it doesn't work on a promotional level. I said, if you look at...
SPEAKER_04: olympic boxing that was the example i used at the time because i had a background in boxing and i used boxing as my sort of background on my foundation for the point
SPEAKER_04: I said, if you look at boxing in the Olympic Games and it is in the Olympic Games, but outside of the Olympic Games, boxing is very different. Professional boxing is very different to Olympic boxing. It's done in a different way and it's done in a way that you can promote the athletes because the consumer buys the athlete. They buy the character, they buy the individual. And if that individual resonates with them, they want to see that person compete.
SPEAKER_04: And supermatch arm wrestling was the way forward in my mind. And when I first said that, everybody laughed at me. I mean, I was young in the game and people said, oh, yeah, that's how you did it in your sport. But this isn't boxing. This isn't fight sports. This is arm wrestling. You need to get used to that. You've only been around for a few. I've been in the game since 1986. I was only a puppy. And there were more established people in the game. So I didn't really get...
SPEAKER_04: any foothold on that. So I started a thing called the Iron Arm in the UK and I did it myself. And I did supermatch arm wrestling. I did a card, an open main draw card and supermatch arm wrestling above it. And it was really bloody successful. And the bit that people loved was the supermatches. When I got the Eurosport gig, I'd been to them with main draw arm wrestling three, four times. They didn't care.
SPEAKER_04: They weren't interested. They said, well, yeah, but how do we market it? Who are the guys? I said, well, these top guys. And you know that these guys are probably going to be in the final. And they said, well, what about if we only invited 10 guys or we only invited eight guys and they're in a main draw tournament? I said, well, no, what I'd like to do is one-on-one matches, just one-on-one matches. You would have a fight card with one-on-one matches. And when I went with that route, they said, yeah, okay. And away we go.
SPEAKER_04: And the PAL then took on that format as well. They liked it. Igor Mazarenko, you know, you love or hate Igor Mazarenko. Igor Mazarenko has done an enormous amount for the sport of armwrestling. And he, in my opinion, Igor and Hasan, the PAL, as it was then, was a magnificent promotion. They've done incredible promotion. Some of the stuff was mega. The Nemirov Cup was mega.
SPEAKER_00: Mark Havardy, thought it or whatever you want to call it was mega mega show there's been others you come jack I used to love the uconn jack ual w. I can't deny, you know we can you know I mean a lot, a lot of people's mind or like you know oh King King has died like long live the new King or die that, like, there is no success today that I mean came.
SPEAKER_04: right away it all was over a lot of people's shoulders you know it came to uh this point yeah yeah strange isn't it because out of the misery global misery that was the pandemic where it was a very challenging time economically you know global chaos really like like the worst in living memory nobody's seen anything like that before
SPEAKER_04: but it's created something like East versus West, which is phenomenal. I mean, for a purist arm wrestler, if you're a purist arm wrestler, what's not to like? East versus West is excellent, isn't it? I mean, you've got the very best in the world. It's mega. It could even evolve to different direction as well. Like, for example, we did the East versus West 2.
SPEAKER_00: A lot of people were asking about tournaments as well. And I asked John. John said, yes, and we can do that way, too. But it is probably going to kill the like supermatch, you know, excitement when you see those guys, you understand? Maybe it wouldn't. Maybe it wouldn't. But what I'm just saying that everything I did was like not like all what I think, you understand?
SPEAKER_00: Like I listened to community, I listened to the top athletes, you know, it is just happening by itself. Like after that point, Raymond Lippins told me again, listen, okay, that's good. Super matches are good, but I mean, there are a lot of arm wrestlers, thousands, tens of thousands of arm wrestlers, they like East versus West, but they see it unreachable. They want to be there and it's unreachable.
SPEAKER_00: And then they are asking me, can we be there? I said, like, you somehow need to prove yourself, you know, somewhere, you know, and they say, like, how? And I'm like, OK, maybe go love wars or something, you know.
SPEAKER_04: and then the the qualification idea came to me that way so that you know i mean if they are thinking they are good enough to be there it is your your chance my friend just well the funny thing is unless you need that as a revenue stream which i i highly endorse if that's the case that and it allows these first west to go to continue then great but i dis i have to say i disagree with the
SPEAKER_00: the comment that it's unreachable or not ascertainable that that's just not true is it i mean if you're good enough you'll get there yeah yeah i need to see someone like i will tell you something it is a little easier for north american guys to be here sure than the eastern guys because he's talking about so many countries while they'll be talking about two three countries in fact as a competition
SPEAKER_00: It is harder for them because you're talking about you're trying to pick from Brazil, US, Canada, while these people are coming against the best from 20 different countries, just say 10 different countries. But it is easier to
SPEAKER_04: have a chance from north america you understand because back the other way and you know okay and i'll ask anybody i ain't got the chat up but i'd ask anybody in the chat to just hear me out with this let's work it the other way if you're if east versus west is your pinnacle of the sport from a super match live competition where it's just about the event which it pretty much is at the moment you know there's arguments around king of the table but let's let's just focus on east versus west for now and you have got the potential to run
SPEAKER_04: one or two days and on those two days and that may overkill it to be honest one day is probably right and if you're running 15 super matches which is a lot of super matches you know and the time taken to do that and it represents the pinnacle of the sport and you're within that representing all the weight divisions
SPEAKER_04: And you want ladies represented in there as well, because they deserve that shout and that status in there. At the moment, there's an argument that they may be underrepresented, whatever. Everybody's going to have their opinion.
SPEAKER_04: How do you get to a situation where you fit all these guys in? You couldn't physically do enough. It's almost like saying the UFC is unattainable. No, it isn't. You've just got to be really good or really prominent. The two ways in are really good or really prominent and popular. That's it. And if you find yourself that you're not ticking one of those boxes,
SPEAKER_04: then, I mean, if a guy goes around North America and literally decimates competition wherever they go, male or female, and rises into the ascendancy at a level that is unquestionable, do you think you'd spot them? Do you think you'd know about them, you personally? Do you think I'd know about them? Do you think you'd know about them? And do you think it'd be East versus West? Just answer me that question, honestly. Yeah, there is one guy who says, Engin, I love you, but the
SPEAKER_00: East versus West card is pretty mid. Is what, mate? M-I-D. Pretty mid, he says. Like, medium size or what does it mean? M-I-D. Is mid. M-I-D. Mid. I don't know what he means. I'm not sure what that means. I mean, he says it's no good, probably. Well, I mean... I mean, I will tell you the matches. John Brzing, Irakli Zrakashvili.
SPEAKER_00: I start laughing, I'm not gonna count all of them.
SPEAKER_00: This guy needs a life, you know, just please stay away if you think that it's no good, you know. The level of the competition is ridiculous. It's ridiculous. What was that? The level of the competition is ridiculous. Yeah, but you can find this kind of person is trying to convince everyone. He said that everyone who has some knowledge would agree with him that it's no good. Okay. Yeah. Pretty solid card in my estimation. Yeah, it is not superstar. Okay, John Bersink is not superstar.
SPEAKER_00: Irakli is not, Rustam is not. Ali Jan, see these people came here probably to throw shits, you know, just that's, I'm telling you. I mean, if I would come with this card as the first East versus West, then they will lose their mind. But again, the human nature, they, after the point, they don't appreciate. But I really need to stay away from this negativity you bring in here, the greatest of all time.
SPEAKER_04: uh yeah and then whatever anyway so let's let's talk about um can you just uh give me one moment apologies to everybody in the chat i just had a call from my wife yeah and she just sent me a message saying neil can you ring me urgently you give me one moment i'm just going to make this call i'm going to stay on and just find out what's going on yeah yeah you continue i will talk with the chat here guys uh one guy also was saying that how is it
SPEAKER_00: If Levan is strength and then someone is also strength, 10. My friend, there is, first of all, read the card very well. There is no word that it says, no stat that it says strength. You know, first read carefully, my friend. Then second, we can talk. Also, just because you have a stat, it says that like 10, it doesn't mean that you're going to beat everyone. You may have this, 10, but it doesn't. Like, for example, Richard Lapis, I don't think his risk was 10.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think that his top roll was 10. I don't think that even his hook was 10. His side pressure, yes. Explosiveness, yes. I don't even know about his endurance, but he was strong enough to side press almost everyone. So where you are making mistake, probably you don't understand about arm wrestling. You think that the total of this stats
SPEAKER_00: the one who has the highest number should be beating anyone who has lower numbers than he has. Like, for example, if John Burzink has more total than Ongarbe, it doesn't work that way. There is only one difference that can change the result. Like, your endurance wouldn't even help you if it doesn't turn to an endurance game.
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so I mean, I can teach you like nonstop three hours about this, but I don't think that I'm talking about that guy. I don't think that your level is enough to get this. Don't take it as being a rifle or something, because I sometimes think by myself, I say, you gave your life, you are one of the most knowledgeable guy, I'm not saying the people says, and then if someone is coming here trying to preach and teach,
SPEAKER_00: I think that what is wrong starts there, not me to tell him how it is, but him to try to teach me like, oh, I don't know. And like I sent some of the stats to Neil and to Devon. We don't like the difference between all this, like maybe 0.5.
SPEAKER_00: Maximum sometimes, not even everything, sometimes maybe maximum one. I don't even see any two-point difference, you know, just like they are usually the same, same. So, and then you guys are saying that everyone's stats are so high. My friend, like the stats that you are seeing, like these guys, there is no better ones on the earth. You are seeing if the best ones in the earth doesn't have some eight, some nines, and even some 10,
SPEAKER_00: then who's going to have this? We are not telling you, like we are not giving you a guy who is like fifth place in the world and having eight, nine, tens, you know. We are showing you the best guys in the world. If these guys don't have those numbers, who are going to have these numbers? These are not state level athletes. These are not beginners. These are not national level athletes. These are not even world level. Many of them are world champions. And some of them,
SPEAKER_00: are about being a world champion legends there are some of them are gods like rustam baba i mean if this guy i and neil today i ask him this guy starts at like nines and tens you know and then if he if he show you this and some smartest will come and say oh you gave him all the nines and tails you know the eyes didn't see anything better what do you expect you know i don't know what your uh uh take on this neil
SPEAKER_04: don't know what i cannot hear you what about now yeah yes yeah okay yeah there's an old saying that a little knowledge is very dangerous or a little knowledge is very dangerous thing and i think that's
SPEAKER_04: pertinent to the discussion in some respects, when you know the level of the the guys intrinsically, and you know what they're capable of, and you've seen them across a really broad subsection of abilities, you're very aware of what you're dealing with. And in the case of 99.9% of the guys that are on the East versus West card, you're really dealing with operation on arm wrestlers. I mean, these are guys that are
SPEAKER_04: Right there, you know, they're knocking on the door at world level and the margins at that level or in any sport, the margins at the top level are pretty fine. You know, it's almost like the top tennis players. If they hit their ace, you're probably not going to return it.
SPEAKER_04: And I think that's one of the biggest issues for people to wrap their head around. And I get it. It is difficult because, you know, the old saying, there are levels to this game and there are levels to many sports. I mean, so many times I get people who say, oh, you know, would you come back into arm wrestling? Yeah, I'd love to come back into arm wrestling. Do I think I'd be able to do anything now? No.
SPEAKER_04: I'm a 50-year-old man, 49-year-old man who's had joint rebuilds and damage. I don't believe that I could compete with... It'd be kind of sad, actually, if I could. And I'm naturally trained. So it'd be kind of sad if I could come back in and do something. It'd disappoint me.
SPEAKER_04: You know what I mean? It'd be like, cause I know where the levels are and I know what I put in at the time I was pursuing the thing. It was six days, three hours, no rest, total focus. So if I could come back in now, when I, when I haven't done any arm wrestling for nine years, um, and focus nothing on, on even training for it, uh, I'd,
SPEAKER_04: be a real gut check for me i think what was i doing all that time you know the guys that are at the top end of this and the girls are at the top end of this they really do devote their life to it i mean 100 you know what i used to have a plate loader behind my my sofa at home rest of my you know my wife was watching something on tv watching a film and i'm cracking out flat pelican grip i'm you know it's obsessive
SPEAKER_00: nobody knows that better than you you're the most obsessed guy i've ever come across in the game i think people are thinking this way there is le one who is ten so the rest needs to be five six seven five six seven because le one is ten my friend that one is ten for super heavyweights understand there are guys like in the i can say lighter classes there are guys um who are
SPEAKER_00: like Ruslan Babaev is not any less than Levan. If Ruslan Babaev sometime had harder competition, it is because he was pulling against another lightweight or middleweight and at same exact weight. When you go super heavyweight, Levan is so dominant. He is around 400 pounds.
SPEAKER_00: while he's pulling 270 280 pounds they will not it doesn't take anything away from him he's 10 10 and 8 9 10 10 10 yes but his dominance is coming because of his extra ordinary creation as well you understand and some people said oh he takes this and this that's big not anyone who takes something can become like him either they need to understand there is some
SPEAKER_04: genetic as well there, you understand? They need to understand it. I think the other important factor there, Engin, is how you grade the system. As I said, unfortunately I ain't got the chat up,
SPEAKER_04: If people in the chat are thinking that you would grade it on a certain way in their mind and your grading system is slightly different for that, it's going to give you a different view. If you're grading the thing, if your rankings from 1 to 10 are on effectiveness, so ultimately putting an arm on a pad within the sport, within the spectrum of arm wrestling, how effective was that individual at achieving there to there?
SPEAKER_04: just putting an arm on a pad that's your one to ten within that you're not grading their technical prowess necessarily no you're trying to break it down but it's almost like saying okay well rocky marciano wasn't a good boxer but he knocked everybody out he fought so at the end of the fight it's amazing how many good boxes there were that were led on the floor unconscious while he was collecting his check
SPEAKER_04: know it it's a funny argument to have isn't it it's effective yeah he wasn't a great he's not a classy boxer he's not muhammad ali he doesn't move well but he'll knock your head off so with levon there's a little bit of that to be perfectly honest when we were discussing levon the other day we're not sure how good levon is the current version of levon i don't know how good is he we haven't seen him extended you we haven't seen him
SPEAKER_04: taken into that long drawn out technical battle there's just not been anybody capable of taking him there to get him into that situation i was kind of hoping that devon didn't get hurt and devon could have been that guy devon getting hurt so early in the match
SPEAKER_04: We never got to see anything there, and Devon may not have been capable of it. We'll never know. It is what it is, and it's in the history books. But until we get a guy that can get the brakes on, put Levan in some kind of difficulty, then we'll find out. A while back, everybody thought it was going to be one guy, then it's going to be another guy, then it's going to be another guy. Hermes, he's next in line. But is it going to be Zauer? Who the fuck knows? I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, we go right now as much as we know. And what I differ with you about the Devon match, first round, he wanted the top role. Second round, he went more side with still Pornader. And that is how Devon got injured. I don't think that, you know, the result would change. And I think that Devon got injured because of that, the overpowered, you know, being overpowered with the side pressure. There is a question for you, James Stewart is asking.
SPEAKER_00: Neil, when are you doing East versus West qualified event? And during the live stream, it says. Okay, so I'm going to do things differently. You know, a lot of people talk about... Neil is going to do his own way. This is a unique guy. You don't tell Neil what to do.
SPEAKER_04: If Neil wants to help you, he does in his own way. Go ahead, Neil. The best way of doing this is I asked you what you really wanted to get from me. If you remember the conversation, I said, what's your real objective? What's your true aspiration, Engin? And you said, I want it to be truly accessible so anyone can get there. Okay. Now, I said, are you looking for a business interest to make money out of it?
SPEAKER_00: You said, no, not really. I don't need that. Nothing at all. I just want people from Ireland, best guys from Ireland, to be able to come to Istanbul for the main qualification finals. I trust you. You said you're going to do it in your own way. If anyone doesn't like the way Neil is doing, there are some other qualifications in Europe you can also compete. Neil and I, we agreed that Neil is going to do this in the way that
SPEAKER_04: thinks is uh on his own way i should say right neil yeah the way that i think that can work best i want to try and give back to the uk clubs basically so i don't want to make money from this it's not my promotion yeah it's not something that i that i want to go down that route for at all it's your promotion and it's something that you are looking for true
SPEAKER_04: representation you're looking for the best so let's really find them if somebody really wants to do this what i would say is i want i'm this message is going out to every single uk and ireland club all of them okay if you are a uk an ireland club i want you guys to set up your own qualifier at your club i'm going to post a list of this will be probably around march
SPEAKER_00: David Ward, Ph.D.: All right, you know we can we can go through it tonight, but basically the weight classes of East versus West that are published. Fadi Bardawil, Ph.D.: One more thing I will say the East versus West seven is going to be on apple 29th. Fadi Bardawil, Ph.D.: So when you.
SPEAKER_00: most likely April 28th or 7th or something around that time, we will do the main qualifications that will come from some other parts of Europe, like Romania and then Italy and Norway and Euro event. So make sure that, you know, they will be coming to April because there they are going to pull and then the winners from Europe and the winners from the America, South, North together,
SPEAKER_00: I will, uh, six guys, six, like four, four men and two ladies. They will be doing super matches, but I will divide it to a few events because I cannot really invite six of these matches in one event. Maybe three, this event is versus was eight and nine.
SPEAKER_00: or maybe two, two, two, but I will say this. Sorry, go ahead. No, that's very important, mate, because the amount of people that you can accept at the Istanbul show is kind of critical, isn't it? And you're looking for the very best to be there. How many guys from the UK do you want there? Top two from each category. I want you to send me, if they want to come, of course, two guys from each category. But again, I give guarantee for the right arm winners.
SPEAKER_00: not the left arm you will say why left arm it's gonna be uh too many it's gonna be not six matches but 12 matches you understand so i really need to uh limit this uh with left arm i want to look and and and decide instead of giving that and so anyone who is coming here for the left-hand qualification let them know that there is the i don't give guarantee
SPEAKER_04: and but i will of course when they win with right arm for sure i will cover the expenses and i will pay some money when they come to the supermatch yeah so what i want to do is make sure that the people that are going there are not paying a lot of money because it's difficult to get there and it's going to be difficult to make it to the final because it's a very high level and we you also want to see the best guys so my
SPEAKER_04: suggestion is that all the uk clubs every single one of you run your own qualifier charge what you guys see fit to your club members and run the competition at your club at a time which at a time and a place which is most convenient for you and your club members so that all of them are involved and find out who are the very best two representatives of your club
SPEAKER_04: From there, we go to a regional. So the clubs that are in a set area, the south of England, for example, the north of England, agree a place where you guys want to do it. And the next round is there.
SPEAKER_04: So the top two guys from each club go there and we boil it down to that again. On the weekend of the 25th, 26th or 24th, 25th of March, Armours Iron House 3 is going to be there. I'll get a venue close to the Iron House and the guys from the Iron House will come down and we'll watch the people compete
SPEAKER_04: who will be in the elimination, the East versus West. That's what we'll do.
SPEAKER_04: so every club you want every club to give you already two two names i want every club to give me their selection from those weight categories send me the names who won the qualifiers use the money that you raise to pay for them to go to the next stage and so on so these guys aren't having to travel there's no oh we gotta travel from scotland to manchester scotland to none of that do it at your club right there so you don't have to qualify you don't have to go anywhere to do it do it there
SPEAKER_04: All the clubs, you organise it. You've got your time to organise it with your clubs. Find out who are your best guys. All of you. Every single UK club. Let's see who's really the best at club level, then at regional level. Then we'll do it at national level on the weekend of the Arm Wars. The guys that do well there will have two options. Number one, they get picked for East versus West. Number two, we spot them if we haven't already got them for Arm Wars. How's that?
SPEAKER_00: You will also choose what you will look at, and you will also choose yeah that's good that you know he will be like yeah. It will pay anything no money no nothing. yeah yeah. yeah. Anyway, so. Okay Okay, can we talk predictions about the upcoming is. Okay, because.
SPEAKER_00: I will tell you something, no disrespect to anyone, but I enjoy talking about arm wrestling with you the most. Thanks, brilliant. Likewise. Because we can talk about past, today, everything, techniques and this and that, you know, we have a lot of things in common. So, and many of the, many of the, usually I invite people who will compete East versus West.
SPEAKER_00: and many of them i should say most of them like have problems to know the athletes on the east doesn't know much about west west doesn't know much about east unless it is very popular guy understand so that that's not the case with you so i think it will be very very good very very good many of them i don't even ask because i already know that they don't know okay douglas ehrlich
SPEAKER_04: So, yeah, this is going to come up a number of times today. Doug is, without question, when he's on, when he's firing, a very, very powerful, very, very capable lad. Really strong arm wrestler, strong being the operative weapon. This guy is really strong. That's his key. I don't really see Doug as the most technical arm wrestler in the world. I see him as a...
SPEAKER_04: as a very very strong guy with a very sound foundation in the sport and balls he's got some venom and he's also i think doug feels overlooked i think he feels like he's got a point to prove and that he's got pretty high pretty lofty aspirations the way that doug sees this match
SPEAKER_04: is a perfect opportunity for him to go out and signal flair to the world that he's here and he's serious and you better pay attention. So if you're looking to tick that criteria, who would you pick? You'd pick a guy that is going to go into a position that you feel is well suited to you from a technical standpoint. A guy that's got a certain set of physical characteristics that are suited to you.
SPEAKER_04: again relay pinch tick a guy that you feel like you may have some physical advantages over in that respect if you're a bigger guy better structure could be an advantage again tick the intangible or the the thing that's difficult here is that you cannot really emulate real match competition
SPEAKER_04: it's extremely difficult to recreate that in a training environment. It just is. It's just hard to do. However hard you train, whatever methodology you employ, it's very, very hard to recreate a training scenario in a situation which is training. Sorry, to recreate a match scenario in a situation which is training. We have not seen, Doug, in a long, drawn out,
SPEAKER_04: guttural battle, which is likely, unless he's a measure stronger than Ray Lipinge, it is likely to be what he encounters at East versus West. Ray Lipinge is not the very best arm wrestler in his weight class, but he sits in that secondary, tertiary tier of very, very talented, very versatile specialist arm wrestlers. And what is he a specialist at? Supermatch.
SPEAKER_04: Because that versatility allows him to go through the spectrum of his technical arsenal within a supermatch format. He can try a lot of angles, try a lot of different things. He's brave. He'll do that. And he knows that he has got more than one ace in the pack. That's going to allow him to test Doug in a lot of areas. And if the breaks go on, if the strength gap is close,
SPEAKER_04: He's a proven entity. He knows that if the brakes go on, he can last the distance. In the most difficult, balls-out, red-line matches imaginable. He's done it many, many times. So you would have to say, and I think Doug Ehrlich would agree, that Ray, on paper, is the favourite. Because of the other guy is not being...
SPEAKER_04: active enough lately not been active enough everybody who's in the sport will know that doug represents a threat he's a bigger guy he's very strong he's got a good pedigree and some good wins against some good arm wrestlers but we have when was the last time you saw doug in a in a in a big super match the last time i remember was a wl um do you um yes but if the guy knows what he is doing like
SPEAKER_00: Like Jerry, after like three years or something, absence, just came and beat Gennady. And of course, Ongarve pulled some Asian championships or something, but not really super match type of event. He just came and beat Brzee. Now Rustam is coming in that shape. We don't know how it's going to be with Pauline. If the guy knows how to bring himself,
SPEAKER_00: the table and if he's mentally ready it can be but as you said we don't know because just because there are a few examples that positive it doesn't mean that he will be also able to do the same thing but what i understand from what you say you said eric is strong probably possibly maybe stronger than raymond's but if raymond somehow balances the match is more well-rounded and
SPEAKER_04: more probably better endurance i believe i believe my opinion would be that if i'm giving somebody points on the board for endurance it would be ray um i don't know whether doug's stronger than ray i don't know is he i don't know ray i think is underrated in terms of how strong he is race very strong
SPEAKER_04: Ray's not the most explosive guy in the world. He's slow as a cart horse in some respects. And I mean, he can go quick in the right set of circumstances, but he's not Chiprianov. You know what I mean? He's not that guy. He's not the guy that's blisteringly quick. He is quick over the first inch. He's quick to position. And the thing is for both these guys, there's nobody coming with any surprises here. Ray's not bringing anything that Doug's not seen before.
SPEAKER_04: It's all documented, isn't it? Everybody can see what Ray does. Similarly, Doug's not bringing anything that Ray hasn't seen before. Neither of these guys are a puzzle for the other one to solve. That's not what we're looking at. We're looking at measured, well-known quantities. And it's going to come down to, is Doug a measure stronger than Ray and can power through him in any position? Doesn't matter what weapon he chooses.
SPEAKER_04: Is he strong enough to finish the match early? That's the question. Because if he doesn't... If the match stops somehow, you'd say that Ray has the edge. I believe so. If Doug was to outlast Ray, the first hat to come off would be mine. That would be very impressive. It would be very impressive. You say that Douglas needs to win quick, but we don't even know if he can do that. And
SPEAKER_04: if the match is balanced, right? So you are saying that you are expecting Ray to win that match. Yeah, I see Ray as a favorite in the match coming in. I also think there are other intangibles. Travel can be an effect. I've often seen in my career and experience in my career, if you've traveled a long distance, there can be an effect on the body, it can be problematic in that respect. It's going to be interesting. There's a lot of big
SPEAKER_04: reputation that comes with Doug because Doug's no bum Doug's bloody strong if Doug shows up at his best he's a really serious match I hope I hope that Ray's taking him really seriously because he needs to because Doug's no joke you know but Ray Lipinge competes against a lot of very very strong lads with great regularity and that frequency of competition and frequency of
SPEAKER_00: real match scenario is a weapon. Yeah. Douglas just wrote here that it's me and I will not lose. Good on you, Doug. Good on you, mate.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, let's go. I really like Doug Ehrlich. She's a great lad. I mean, Doug was actually... It has nothing to do with the personality or something. We are just, you know, honest analysers. Nobody should get upset, you know. Someone else may come here and he may say that Douglas is going to destroy Rymus. It is just opinion, you know. It's just... Well, if Doug doesn't believe that he's going to go over there and crack him, then... Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_04: might as well not get on the complain you know what i mean you can't go into this thing and he's going to not not think he's going to not so there's no falseness there you either think you're going to win or not it's not about what you think of a guy it's not about the personality it's not about the person and how you rate those i mean remember our conversations about sandras and matt mask and the way that i weighed that up prior to the event it actually went nothing like i thought it was going to go i did i did have sandras as a favorite
SPEAKER_00: I predicted Sandris would win, but I thought it would be a dogfight. I thought it would be Matt would get out the block, take the first couple of pins, and then Sandris would manage to get the brakes on. I said either Matt Mask was going to destroy him or Matt Mask was going to take his wrist and Sandris was going to fight like that. What happened there never came to my mind. Especially after Sandris had COVID.
SPEAKER_00: And, and I asked somebody, it's like, what, what, what kind of COVID was it? He said, it looks like, you know, resting helped me. You know, that is also a fact. You know what I based a lot of my prediction on? When you train nonstop, so heavy all year.
SPEAKER_04: Trust me, sometimes you take even one month break. You are like rock. Yeah, I had this conversation today. I had this conversation today with one of the UK lads that I like called Rob Frampton, who's just coming into the game.
SPEAKER_04: And I said exactly this, Robert, if he's watching this, we'll know. We had that conversation. I said, sometimes when you've been training your ass off, you've been pulling all hard like that, that little bit of time off, everything knits together and you come back and you can't imagine how strong you are. All those minor injuries, everything is healed up. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes I'm telling you, resting is better than training. It just depends on the situation.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, let's go. On that scenario with the Matt and Sandra thing, a lot of my estimations prior to that, do you know what I was basing them on? The lever length and Matt's prior experience with Ron Bath. Because at times you'd think, oh, Matt should crack Ron Bath. He's going to get Ron Bath. And you always thought he would. But just because of the size of arm, the length, the hand, the length of the lever, the manner in which Ron can pull and block and the versatility.
SPEAKER_04: Ron managed to get the job done, and that's what I saw. At no point did I think that Sandri Sedis would be able to control Matt in the manner he did. I simply didn't think that could happen. I thought he'd win, but I thought it'd be a red line to do it. That was mega. Yeah. Mega impressive. 55 minutes, we are here, and then we just covered one match, so let's go. We might be on a while, yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: pork chop versus syrup oh mate i am so excited for this curtis
SPEAKER_04: Curtis is an unmeasured quantity and unknown for me, but it's one of those things like the Loch Ness Monster. It's like, oh, fucking beasties be here. This guy's really strong. And so many guys that I trust, so many guys that I know have a lot of faith in Curtis Cameron and what he can do. And the man looks like he's a stout individual. Curtis is thick, looks like a power lifter, just looks like just a strong man.
SPEAKER_04: He's looking in a mirror. Now, the funny thing is, Zurab is not a big man. No. When you meet Zurab, he's not a big man. But he's extremely well conditioned. He's got heart for a day. I really like Zurab. He's a fucking warrior. He's just that guy that will go to the absolute edge of it. You know what I mean? What we saw with Ron Bath, that's the essence of Zurab. He is up for it. And he's extremely powerful.
SPEAKER_04: The difficult thing for Zurab in some of the matches that he's had today has been that he's had to be the guy that contains the match, that tries to track his opponent down and put them into a bad position. With Curtis, not at all. Curtis is going to come exactly where he wants to be. So this is a great match, an interesting match to see where that level of strength is.
SPEAKER_04: and i'm going to learn something here this is my first measure of curtis when he's been pulling another guy who's gonna fight fire with fire my previous um
SPEAKER_04: looks at curtis have either been with an arm wrestler that with all due respect to curtis is a little out of his depth right now so todd hutchins who's quite happy to pull you know anywhere you want he's happy about the power game but that's a huge ass for curtis to come in and bang with with todd todd's not normal you know he's he's the absolute elite elite in strength zurab's not that guy but he is extremely strong
SPEAKER_04: so i'm i'm really looking forward to learning a little bit about curtis cameron he's a bigger man much bigger man actually
SPEAKER_04: Yes, he's a much bigger guy. He's going to be in his absolute sweet spot. It's kind of a no excuses match for Curtis from a technical perspective. I don't know Curtis. I look forward to meeting the lad. And I look forward to learning about where his level is right now. It reminds me a great deal of the Vosinski match.
SPEAKER_04: You know, in terms of I knew Adam was rock strong and I've seen Adam pull and he impressed me with the Raka's win and, you know, and a few others that notable, Robbie Russell, other guys that he'd beaten handily, who I rate very, very highly. So this is a little bit like that. I get to learn a bit about Curtis and I get to learn about where his level is. I do think that it's a no-lose match for Curtis and I hope that he isn't feeling a lot of pressure. Similarly to what we just talked about, this is the first
SPEAKER_04: match of this magnitude and this degree of notoriety for curtis so i would just come and enjoy the experience come relaxed don't ask too much of yourself and just use it as that sort of building block to see where you're at and if you come and you win great you know what i mean if he comes and gets a result against nurab it's really strong it's really powerful and neil do you know robert baxter you know right what yeah oh yeah
SPEAKER_04: my god yeah great very strong guy very smart and very good person uh my experience highly articulate guy at the table does what he wants shows i mean really impressive understated underrated robert baxter's a great puller yeah robert baxter
SPEAKER_00: and a Turkish guy, his name is Ahmet Yenerer. Oh, they've been backwards and forwards. Yes, yes. Didn't Robert beat him and then lost to him? Last year, last year, Robert won. This year, Ahmet won. That's right. But this year, Robert was in kind of a little bit winning position and Ahmet was just defending. And then Robert fouled out. Yeah, I remember. It was a tough match.
SPEAKER_00: And then after that, he pulled with the Italian guy. What was his name? I forget again. Oh, come to me in a minute. Oh, what the fuck is he called? You know, the... Not Davide, it's not Davide. Davide Cappa. Yeah, yeah, Cappa, Cappa, yeah. Yeah. Davide Cappa, right? He pulled Cappa. I remember. But the last time that he pulled, Robert didn't... Robert fouled out once, but he also lost once straight up, didn't he? No, it was in the final.
SPEAKER_00: Because Ahmed and Robert pulled, and then Robert lost on fouls. And then he had a long match with Kappa, he won. But in the final, he was kind of exhausted, and Ahmed beat him. So this year, they are going to do the match, super match, and then we will see. Any opinion about that? Yeah, I'm going to go Robert. I'm going to go with Robert on...
SPEAKER_04: much what i was saying about ray i think that robert has got more options i think robert's not necessarily as strong my only concern there is the distance of travel uh because robert i hope robert coming in early and getting some rest and chilling out and able to there's no weight restriction nothing like that it's just a no no yeah i i i'd have to go with robert
SPEAKER_04: I think Robert, he's a very versatile arm wrestler, very intelligent puller. Yeah, I'd go Robert. But that's a good match. That's a hook war. Yeah. Yeah, I do too. I do too. But I think Robert will be able to gap it better in the later rounds. I think he'll be able to find the distance better and just create more separation. Unless, of course, he's just outgunned. I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: hard to hard to say on a main draw tournament is very different and uh the turkish lads gonna be probably in a better position here because anybody who's who pulls very deep and tight through a main draw tournament as the tournament progresses they're always getting a degree of fatigue on their arm you know for both guys this is going to be different because they're going to be fatiguing at the exact same rate and it can that can open up
SPEAKER_04: myriad of opportunities to set traps for your opponent and that little bit of experience additional experience and potentially technical prowess is why i think robert might edge it he might edge it but yeah great match very interesting match and let's go let's go to the next one chance show david arabuli
SPEAKER_00: is the training partner used to be a very honorable he used to be a pretty bloody solid level he was like a you know a second he's not that old but 2019 walls i think i i remember he was around like sunday's level like i i don't know who won that match but at that time of course sunday's
SPEAKER_04: probably wasn't as good as he is today. No, yeah. I wouldn't have put him as high as Sandrisch now. I wouldn't put him in that. Who would I put him similar to? I'm going Chance. I think that Chance is going to win that. I think Chance...
SPEAKER_04: stylistically i think he's the type of guy that favors chance in some respect chance may be able to bait him pretty good uh yeah i'm gonna go chance and i'm gonna go chance uh quite convincingly i think yeah i think chance is pretty tricky if the i mean obviously if he can real chance in yeah he's got the opportunity to beat him but i just think very dangerous guy or any hook pullers i mean yes when i say any
SPEAKER_00: probably not any normal human yeah yeah like maybe maybe someone like gennady or yeah yeah but yeah yeah yeah but anyone who is not really like captain or something if you put out a bully in with curtis cameron if you put him in with zurab it's gonna be a
SPEAKER_04: in pull it's going to be a battle he's strong really strong really durable um i just feel like chance sometimes does well with guys that are very very strong uh because he's tricky as hell you've got to be able to set counter traps and i think for me out of bullies pretty much route one football you know he's the guy that does what he does and he does it well he's strong um
SPEAKER_00: Where has he been at, though? Has he been active? This is the thing, you see. That's what's in the back of my mind. I haven't seen him for a while. He's been active because he's all-time training with those Georgian guys like Levan and Irakli all the time. But since he hasn't competed, he never really programmed himself to compete in events. So he has been active.
SPEAKER_04: but not the competition level active okay so so maybe it's a closer match that i'm giving him credit for then if he's being active the guy from 2000 i think last time i saw him was probably like 2018 or something that guy yeah he's he's really competitive could could could do something but i haven't seen him pull for a while so
SPEAKER_00: I'm going with chances right on his game. Now he's motivated. He's fast. He's firing. And I rate chance highly. I just, I don't think chance is going to be very on point. I think he's hit. You want to be tense? You need to top roll him. And even when you top roll him, you better control his pronator as well. Because if he has the pronator, he can still hit that side way. That guy, you're jumping inside. I saw him.
SPEAKER_00: I saw John trying to hook him, I saw Tatashins trying to, Tatashins won, but that was nowhere, no way easy. You know, he lost his wrist, everything. If Chance could also control Tat's pronator, just watched round one, he took, whenever he goes, his wrist was going like this because of Tat's pronator.
SPEAKER_00: and one of the reason that todd beat iraqi is because not because iraqi couldn't take his he took but he he kept his own pronator and his side press iraqi so todd also has very strong pronators
SPEAKER_04: So I feel the guys that are going to give Chance trouble are the guys that are threatening his hand and have really good rise and really good structure. And I don't know whether Arabul is that guy. I think he's more route one football. I think he's coming at you with a lot of top end, but I don't think that's too much of a concern necessarily for Chance. He does well with that. And Chance is sharp right now. He's very motivated. He's training very hard. He's a big, strong kid.
SPEAKER_00: His time is now, and I think he'll take some beating. Yeah. Anyway, so people are asking about the trading cards. Yes, there was going to be 30, but now we had Dennis Kipchenko, prime card, his prime stats. And we will also add Ferit right and left and Corey West right and left.
SPEAKER_00: So there will be two cars of it and two cars. So Corey, because they're right and left are not the exact same. So, okay, let's go to another match. Let's go to, uh, I know you are a panel, but the other guy is also dangerous as well. Listen to me first. Whenever I mentioned the names, the way that you are reacting,
SPEAKER_00: like this you are sounding like we talk about just say Hermes Gasparini versus Levan match or something it is because it is because you know armwrestling and you know that these guys for their category is as good as that match oh yeah you know that you know that in many years
SPEAKER_00: those guys make great good size of guys having size of guys mayweather size of guys didn't get enough respect but today for some years already they are the most famous guys making the most money because the ufc fans they understand that you know these guys are good so your reaction is
SPEAKER_00: like a very educated ufc fan level probably more than that of course for the arm wrestling so for you it doesn't matter if i'm talking about the lightweight or woman arm wrestling or that you're showing everyone enough of respect while the guy is saying that it is a mid-size event you know because they don't know they don't know like this match incredible match oh my god
SPEAKER_04: incredible, Matt, for so many reasons, the diversity here that this is chess. I mean, Nurlek we've just seen obviously give a great demonstration of exactly what he's capable of at the WAF for those who didn't see that, go check it out. But that's one of a myriad of his impressive performances.
SPEAKER_04: the biggest danger from him is the explosivity this guy is so explosive i mean he hits like a friggin truck you know he's everything's coming at you all gears forward and like so many um of his
SPEAKER_04: contemporaries he has got a blistering attack i mean talgat's another one that you look at that kind of opponent um and you look at talga you don't see what he is that guy walks past you in the street you don't you don't see the venom that that guy is up there he is just how he hits you oh god you don't even understand you know i i'm i'm a fast guy the slaughter to 2000
SPEAKER_00: 17 it was my first round like really go like a lightning hit to my pronator glad that my pronator is still strong we stuck at the middle he got a foul and then second time i didn't even try to go out because
SPEAKER_00: If the guy is so quick before you move, he's just putting it there. But what I did was with the ready go, I dragged him here. So he was caught on his bicep here. So he couldn't put his, that's how I won. But I tell you what, I couldn't really, I put so many tapes.
SPEAKER_00: i still couldn't pull the semi-final because the way that he hit you know my shoulder was the shoulder off your freaking body yeah yeah yeah yeah he was just hitting i beat him but the rest of the event i mean i couldn't do the the and this is the the the with with nerd alert you've got another guy that is a very very visceral committed hit he's gonna go diving in there like a lunatic on the opposite side of the table
SPEAKER_04: He's a guy who I've got a real, I mean, he's a really, really cerebral, magnificent arm wrestler. We're talking fractions of movements with Mindegas. He understands what he does. He's a purist. This is a top role specialist. It's his game.
SPEAKER_04: He understands the utilisation of pronation of rise and cup in equal measure. And he knows exactly where to position his elbow in order for the application of that power to be. One of my favourite pullers, for sure. If you want to show top role specialist,
SPEAKER_04: that you point like this, this guy is in that level. Yes, he is. And that obviously appeals to me a great deal because I have an affinity with the top role. I love that move throughout my career. The ability for Mendes to control his opponent's angles, to control their willingness...
SPEAKER_04: to hit is very very critical in this match so much is going to be governed by the start by the setup by the ability of mindegas to preemptively put the brakes on to create doubt in the mind of nerd alert to slow him down it's almost like chaos versus calm
SPEAKER_04: And I find this match fascinating. I know how I want to win. I'm heavily in the corner of Mendergas because I'm a big fan of him personally. And I think that he is a magnificent arm wrestler.
SPEAKER_04: I also appreciate the threat that a guy like Nerdlek represents. That explosive hit is a very, very difficult thing to get a hold of. What I like about this is that I feel like if Mindegas can get the right bite on the match, he will purposely, in the early rounds, go into a controlled resting spot and try to bleed his opponent out.
SPEAKER_04: I think that can be a great strategy, but also is a highly dangerous one because of the degree of commitment that you're going to see from Nedelec. And one of the things I'm interested to see is Nedelec's top end power, his red line and his propensity to pull in a bad position if he's put there. Because you often don't see that in a main draw competition because guys are concerned about doing that because they want to go through and progress to the title, which is obviously just done.
SPEAKER_04: This is a very different set of criteria. So it's one of the more fascinating matches for me. One of the more interesting matches for me on this card is this one. I love it. I want Mendegas to win. I feel like Mendegas has the ability to win this match. But you don't know the strength level, so it's hard to guess. I think that most people who know Nerdelec will see him as a favourite.
SPEAKER_04: I think if you went to Kazakhstan, if you went to Azerbaijan, Russia, maybe Turkey, Bulgaria, they would probably see Nerdelek as the favorite from a power perspective. I think they would see Mindergas as a favorite from a technical perspective. And I think that the way I see this going is probably Mindergas. And after the first round, I'll be able to give a prediction on how easy or hard it's going to be.
SPEAKER_00: The thing is, both guys are hunters, you know, and then like, you know, they are very quick for position and everything. And Nurdanet is also very explosive. I don't know if you watched his match with Daniel in the last, but I need to tell you that Daniel and Mindaugas had a war earlier.
SPEAKER_00: and but i will i want to kill it killed men nuggets for the day and another information i want to share about nur dalet you know uh till today i and zolev haji murad are the only only guys that have won waffles in five different categories but this nur dalet won 55 kilos 60 kilos 70 yeah 65 kilo and he took second place in 70. yeah
SPEAKER_00: and he won 75 so he has four weight class uh different weight class uh world titles and only one category he was second so if instead of second if he was first of course he wasn't but
SPEAKER_00: Or if he goes up to 80 in the future and wins, he will be also one of those guys that, you know, within five different categories, he will be even more successful because five goals in different categories and one silver. So it's six category.
SPEAKER_04: The guy is also not a normal guy. No, he's a slayer. But what he is, is a tournament specialist. And I'm interested to learn how he does in a supermatch format. For me, they're almost different sports. So I know where Mendergas is at in supermatch. I don't know where Nerlet is at in supermatch. It's an opportunity to learn about him. What has he got outside of the explosivity? What has he got outside of that initial venom?
SPEAKER_04: that's what i'm looking to to see if if minder can get a bite on him and the strength gap is close then i'd like to see what what nerd let's got second round third round with some fatigue in his arm if it goes that far i'd like to see mindegas win uh i hope he can very very interesting match power explosivity nerd like all day uh finesse artistry minnows
SPEAKER_00: Guys are asking, they knew about 60, 65, and 75. As far as I remember, Nurdalet Aydarhan in 2015, he won 55 as well. And as far as I know, he was just a junior puller. So let's go to the next one. And Gabriela Vasquez Solos versus Barbara Baggiova. Wow.
SPEAKER_04: i mean here we've got the the the completely known quantity in in vasconcellos uh the iron angel bloody phenomenal arm wrestler i mean just a magnificent arm wrestler her first worlds as a baby was manchester oh six at the trafford she has gone on
SPEAKER_04: the most impressive of runs her career is incredible she's a magnificent puller she's a supremely committed arm wrestler lives this thing day in day out has very rarely very rarely been genuinely challenged there's a handful of people say oh yeah she's won 30 world titles she's done this not only has she won them
SPEAKER_04: He's won without getting into second gear in most instances. Can you say that Irina Makeva, Egle and Gabriela, these are the three greatest of all time for female? There are some other names in there that it's hard to forget about, but they're right there. Where would you put Makeva first? I personally have Irina Makeva first.
SPEAKER_00: i do um because because when she was in prime she was able to defeat both gabrielle and eglet correct yeah yeah but but we know we never seen the two days gabriella versus that irina but you know what i even the other day i asked irina i said hello irina you know how are you any any plan on coming back
SPEAKER_04: time to time every three four months i send her a message yeah i just checked and you got you got oh she's arena's a great girl there's other girls that have been dominant uh the great vika gabakova was a just vika gabakova was criminally strong dot jones monstrously strong lady i mean uh leander frayne uh
SPEAKER_04: absolutely beautiful person on and off the table great great girl rock strong female jerry catarat just the you know these are girls that deserve a mention in that in that in that same breath but gabby ain't done yet
SPEAKER_04: And who better? What a great role model Gabi Vasconcelos is. If there's a nicer person in the sport, I don't think I've met him. Gabi's a great girl. And the interesting situation here is that we've got this very big rising star who, you know, you speak to the Slovaks, they'll tell you that Bobora's... Exciting.
SPEAKER_00: whenever i see someone with a potential to be one of the greatest of all time what excites me with barbara is not about only her size and strength but the way that she arm muscles like quite clean yeah i mean he's just smoothly arm wrestling very smooth like like most of the
SPEAKER_04: like top male arm wrestlers you know just maybe what's shocking about that engine is is that because he's so much more powerful in the right areas that she can do you know in a way it's kind of like the levon thing we're talking about earlier on we don't know how good this this girl is
SPEAKER_04: because we you know she's not been put into that stress test before now if she runs over and can stay intact and smooth with with with the iron angel hit because gabby's strong i will tell you something gabriella's side pressure is incredible if if i would pull gabriella i mean i would attack her hand more than her arm
SPEAKER_00: because the the possibility that you get splashed while you're trying to go in the arm is big because her side pressure is like very powerful side pressure is incredibly strong so what i'm just saying that this girl barbara very tall and she's big and strong and her specialty is
SPEAKER_04: I actually would have liked to see her, and I'm sure it will happen, but I actually would have liked to see her, and I think a more, and I'll explain why in a minute, a more difficult stylistic test, an educational stylistic test for me to understand Barbara better would have been Eglavetkete, because of the structure.
SPEAKER_04: The size of hand, the length of arm, the style of arm wrestler would have potentially given Barbora more of a test. If there is an issue here for Gabi, it's purely and simply that Gabi's a powerhouse, but she's not a giant frame girl. Barbora looks to me, I've never met her in person, but she looks to be a very, very big structurally. I think she told me like,
SPEAKER_00: 186 or 88 something and she's 125 kilo. Yeah. I mean, and she's not bad. Dude, that is like 16 kilos heavier than me. Yeah, I'm fat. And I'm six foot one. I mean, like, I cannot say that she doesn't have any overweight, you understand like any extra weight or something. But she's not fat. She's like, like,
SPEAKER_00: don't know how big framed girl she's amazonian who to compare with i don't know like like dot jones yeah yeah yeah like that yeah like don't don't jump you met don't don't watch she's just a big girl just a big giant girl yeah yeah but she's incredible anyway so who is winning this match neil
SPEAKER_04: i would have to say that the favorite would be uh again would be uh barbara uh i would i want i want gabby to win i want gabby to win i feel i feel stylistically it's kind of a difficult match for gabby in some ways because really these girls are different weights you know they're different classes um gabby for me her optimum is much lower weight than this and it's almost it's like the john brazink chasing super heavyweights thing
SPEAKER_04: i think this is like you know like birthing versus richard richard lucas it is not that's exactly what i'm talking about mate it's a difficult one it's like oh really to show people how good barbara is if she comes in and runs over gabby everybody will be like oh gabby ain't that good no gabby's that good it's just that that is a giant girl it will just show that if she just runs through her it will just show that gabby is different level gabby needs to go somewhere
SPEAKER_00: and play an arm wrestle against her shadow or something, you know, just stay away. Gabi has nothing to prove here. If she beat Barbara like this, then she may have something. Like when she beat Egle, she was around 10 kilos heavier than Egle. So this was the open category. But if they bought me at 80 kilos,
SPEAKER_00: then Eglin may have chance if Gabi is not 93 kilo but 80 kilo and because Eglin was 83 kilo so anyway so we will see another anyway so let's go to another match of these matches are incredible one minute mate go Gabi I want Gabi to win one of the uh how to say um
SPEAKER_00: one of the most positive no uh i don't think that anybody would dislike her a lot of people likes me but a lot of people dislike me that that is not the case with gabriella yeah it's like dave chaffee or
SPEAKER_04: female arm wrestling about being like likeable and you know there are two two girls in the world in in the world of arm wrestling that are very very similar in that respect there's a there are two that jump to mind that are just absolutely indomitable they're just spirit is just you cannot stop it
SPEAKER_04: And it's Gabriella Vasconcellos and Marlene Clinesmith. And those two girls are just a wall of positive. They bring so much atmosphere and fun to every event. It's ridiculous. And Gabriella is that girl. She's just a great, great person to have an event. And the fact that she's reaching as far as she is here, she's pulling a girl who's like 125 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: just shows you that how strong this girl is i mean she is unbelievably powerful you know in 2021 i asked gabriella and barbara if they would pull against each other and still
SPEAKER_00: Like, I like this, this pay-per-view things didn't start, but I was already planning to do something. And then I told, I told, I saw the passion, you know, that Barbara has. And I said, you're going to be a future legend. And she started crying and I loved it. Whenever I see her, that she is happy to hear that you understand from someone that she respects.
SPEAKER_00: And then I was the same way. I know her passion. I was the young guy who was just idealistic. If I would hear that from John Brzezinski or anyone, I'm not John Brzezinski, but at that time, who can you say? Maybe Rambat. I would also be that emotional and he would motivate. So these people need to be supported.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, 100%. We know how they feel. That is, like, maybe you remember, I also just so much push about, I was talking about my three favorite arm wrestlers for years, even before East vs. West. I was saying Hermes, Irakli, Mindaugas. I mean, like, what I'm just trying to say that whenever we see a light, like a, you know, the good cloth, you understand? Then we need to really push these people, these young guys. So, the next one.
SPEAKER_00: incredible another match alijan murado and oleg petrenko left arm yeah christ i i listen listen i i dream i dream a day i dream a day that a million of arm wrestling fans would show the reaction that you show when they hear these names because because you show this reaction because because you know the level yeah and and this is
SPEAKER_04: I mean, if people are thinking that, I mean, Petrenko, let's start with Petrenko, right? Petrenko in 2019 beat in the finals, Zloty final, he beat David Padikian. Oh, yeah. Mate, Petrenko is mega strong. I mean, well, I mean, Zurab's not a bum. You know what I mean? And you just saw what Petrenko did with Zurab at the last event.
SPEAKER_04: And with all due respect to Zurab, it was like, you know, it's just... Trust me, even if John didn't find the pronated out way, but somehow he would just turn, he would... Trust me. Listen, if you remember, okay, before the match with John and Petrenko, we spoke about this.
SPEAKER_04: if you recall i said that i thought john would win that match because stylistically i said he'd win at a counter he'd win with ease control because no disrespect to petrenko but he is tailor-made for john but he may beat guys
SPEAKER_04: but can beat John. Do you understand what I mean? I understand. Yeah. It's just that he is perfect for John. If I was going to design a guy to beef up John's resume, I'd pick that dude. He's perfect for John. It's like, oh, my God, John's going to love this. There are other guys. Curtis Galley is one of them. When we were speaking beforehand that I said Curtis Galley is tough. That's a bad man for John because stylistically it's not good for John. The knuckles high guys are problematic.
SPEAKER_04: because of the style John pulls in. Now, what's interesting here is you've got the bullet, the guy that's blisteringly quick and is just going to try and rip through you like unstoppable force against the guy that if he gets the brakes on, you're probably... And they're going to go at it over five times. So, I mean...
SPEAKER_00: Can I tell you something? This guy, Ali Can, in 2017, he was still youth puller. He pulled against, that time I was training the guy, his name, Muhammad Gumusoglu. Yeah, yeah. They went to hook, long match. I think total with the final, it took maybe two minutes, more than two minutes, they pull in hook. And Muhammad went to home because he was in youth category. But Ali Can stayed. After those wars,
SPEAKER_00: competed the seniors and he took third place there and and but the guy can just because he's explosive people think that he doesn't have the the horsepower no he's got no no no no
SPEAKER_04: He's got lots of power. Has he got Petrenko power? I don't know. But the thing is that when the match comes to a settling point, he may be a third difference in the arc. Muratov might be here and Petrenko blasted outside his shoulder. And like you were saying earlier on, that has a residual damage that does you harm. And it's how strong
SPEAKER_04: we've just seen uh what alexander could do we saw that at the world right he ran through the the the big men we get to see how friggin strong petrenko is if petrenko just stonewalls his ass what does that say about oleg you know what i mean that that's like everybody's like holy you know again there's the statement of levels but stylistically here
SPEAKER_04: This is fascinating. I mean, it's fascinating because Ali is fearless. He's not going to look for a way around him. He's going to try and just no load blast through you. It's like you build a wall in front of me, and I'm going to run at it, and I'm not going to slow down. He's seeing through the wall. He's seeing through the wall. Do you know who he reminds me? Do you know who he reminds me?
SPEAKER_00: Just think about from the past, a guy that can hit you like a lightning, but if he gets stopped, he can pull like two minutes, three minutes. Svetan Gasevsky. Oh, God. Yeah. He was one of the guys that he would hit you like, boom, you know, but not only fast, hard. And then he would just get stopped.
SPEAKER_00: remember 2001 poland he pulled the bondo and then maximo and then again you know and he pulled with them like one one and a half minute each so what i am just saying that kind of reminds me him that alejan can hit you and then if he stop he can also pull long time of course not not not gachevsky level right now
SPEAKER_00: but i'm talking about the technical aspects and you know that but alijan is very young still very young he's coming yeah and he kind of not many people has that that can hit like a lightning and then can be if when he gets dug into that position even if he is not as strong as petrenko which i don't think he is
SPEAKER_04: start if they wind in slow and just start to rev up the horsepower i think petrenko wins that match but the interesting thing is that's not what's going to happen what's going to happen is that he's going through the wall and it's ha if he can get to the pad i mean put it this way mate you've got a matchmaking test here haven't you because if he blasts through petrenko in that same way
SPEAKER_00: you going to match him with next who are you going to put him with i mean probably probably that he can yeah but he didn't need to be because there is no one else not that way no i mean we will find that one prudnik you know these there are there are some guys but for now good for start neil like people says that where is this guy where is that guy i mean come on i can't bring everyone all the 50 matches at once but we are starting building something
SPEAKER_00: And then after that, there will be challenges, you know, there will be challenges. So on who your money is? I am going to go with Petrenko. So you are saying that Petrenko eventually will stop him?
SPEAKER_04: yes and win him yeah i am gonna go with petrenko but it won't i won't be in this situation it won't be one that if if um it's the same as the the nerd-elect situation you know what i mean in terms of like if alizam was to crush petrenko bam bam bam i wouldn't be like oh you know wow that couldn't happen no it couldn't happen it's it muratov's got that much drive he may just
SPEAKER_04: Put it to sleep. I just feel like if the brakes go on and when the brakes go on, I feel like Muratov won't stop, won't give it up and think he's served into the net and go again. I think he'll anchor down and try and finish the match. I really hope so. And I hope it turns into a screamer. I actually think he might take a pin like that.
SPEAKER_04: think but from doing so maybe that slows him down the counter argument to that is that it does as much damage to to all legacy yeah yes because because because what happens that while you like 60 of your power the guy is
SPEAKER_04: 100 all the time yes you may you may get like damage you know yeah you're right well i was saying earlier the real interesting point for me here is i don't believe that alistan is a strong if they wound in slow but that's not what's going to happen moratov's going to hit him at a frigging hundred miles an hour by the time
SPEAKER_04: Ole gets the brakes on, in my mind, I would imagine he's in the extreme lower third. And it's how much damage, number one, can he pull him back up from there? Number two, how much damage does it do to him to do that? And that's what's fascinating here. We will see. The good thing is about these matches, we are
SPEAKER_00: find it out a lot of answers yes that you know we would never think about it but then and uh that's why i love super much arm wrestling because it's pure we don't have oh but then he ran into the turk or the bulgarian last round last round he had two minutes with this match he was exhausted he was tired there is no excuse this time the guys know the point they know how they pull let's go
SPEAKER_00: okay let's go now to the next one corey west versus jesus and another one that is gonna be are good with side pressure one is wrist based the other one is pronator based so i see real lens for both guys here this is hard because this is hard mate i will tell you something neil
SPEAKER_00: It is totally about this kind of thing. It is totally up to the strength. You and I, we all know the possibilities, but the last last word is going to be said by their power, their strength, their shape today. So, but I can, I can see Arif is just a little bit dropping here and then hitting him sideways quickly, or he may hook in Arif's pronator and not allowing him. So both, both scenarios is,
SPEAKER_04: possible but the the strength you know we don't know their shape and this is this is right arm isn't it this much it is right yeah right arm oh bloody hell bloody hell i'll go with i'm gonna go with corey
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to call with Corey in an absolute fucking screech. I think this is going to be a great match. I kind of feel like if Corey takes like this, he will have the match. If Corey cannot do that, if Arif takes him and then Corey moves like this, I see that with right arm, when Corey loses his wrist,
SPEAKER_00: He is not as effective as left because left has better tornado, you know, like the round one that Cody hit him and then he beat him like this way. I think he has better risk with right, better tornado with the left. So I think that Corey has to control here or Arif needs to enable his risk. The match is going to be, the score is going to be determined right there, that point.
SPEAKER_04: I kind of disagree a little bit. Why is because I think that Arif will try more. Arif is a more versatile puller. I think he will, if he loses the first match,
SPEAKER_04: I think on the second one, he'll nearly get it. And the third one, he'll nearly get it. So this is, and I think because we're in Istanbul and the kind of guy Arif is, he's a really proud, and he's a frigging excellent arm wrestler. I think he'll die to win. You know what I mean? I just think he's going to. Primary plans are the ones that I say. Hmm.
SPEAKER_00: But then if it doesn't work, of course, he's going to, you know, try. I think the guy will die to win Engen. I think he's going to go absolutely balls out like never. But I tell you what, Corey also is very hungry for the international success. And very, very, very, very strong. Yes, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_00: and i think that corey squeaks it based on that i think i think that corey has really anyone is just going fully out that way to fingers no good if you realize that when when alex tried to go that way
SPEAKER_04: He wasn't good, but whenever he holds here, controlling, he went like controlling here and hitting this way, he was more... Yeah. And I think he's going to move to the side with purpose. And I think that that will do damage to Arif. I think Arif will go so hard to hang on to that that he'll stretch the living daylights out of everything. I see it being a good match. But whenever you imagine Arif is
SPEAKER_04: flashing corey or corey is just turning him and beating you are able to picture both scenarios right yeah um yeah i see corey very dangerous early may get a shock holy moment on arif where arif thinks okay yeah this is serious now i gotta change stuff up and he would and would change things up and find a little different angle hit a little different
SPEAKER_04: put more aggression in there, find a spot because Corey would then rush a little bit maybe at the base.
SPEAKER_04: think this could turn into a dog fight because i do believe that i think i think he'll do anything on everything i think if he turns inside with corey i don't think he's going to get any change from that personally um i think corey would would beat him there just because of the it's the thickness of the ham with corey and it's just a different thing he's a freaking monster but
SPEAKER_04: I do believe that Arif's weaponry in the top role with the low hand, with the aggression, the venom, the fact that he's on home territory, he'll be buoyed by the crowd. I'm sure there'll be a lot of local support there. He's a proud man. He's a warrior. He's a firebrand. He comes with real fire. He's a real Turk.
SPEAKER_00: and i think he will can bring it and i think that it's going to be a fight usually usually usually i'm not saying all every time but usually the way to beat arif was to somehow take his hand once arif has his own wrist he is very strong very strong very strong yeah so the way that he loses if somebody especially if somebody is coming into him or you know he's usually
SPEAKER_00: very strong. Even watch with Hermes match, his Hermes goes like here and then top rolls and he's coming back, you know, but Arif is losing his wrist while he's going. You understand? So yeah, this side pressure is strong. Yeah. Let's see another one. Gennady Kvikminia versus Peritos Manla.
SPEAKER_00: You know the story, right? Gachevski and Ferit had to sleep in the airport. Yeah, and yet the event before, Farid looked ironed. Ferit said that he was even in better shape before he went to Chechnya a second time. But he said that finally when they arrived to Chechnya, it was like 4 or 5 a.m. in the morning. And without sleep, they continued the day and they competed. This is what he told me. But I made a video chat with him.
SPEAKER_04: he was really in airport you know it was just with the luggage you know with him you know i think the other thing is with with that you've got to look at with this match is that both men are highly experienced i mean really experienced i think that uh ferret has to has to believe in himself
SPEAKER_00: I think sometimes if Ferit has a weakness, it's not in the arm. It's that he sometimes can doubt himself a little. I think Ferit is better than he thinks he is. But do you know why it is? When you remember the Ferit, the best of Ferit, where do you remember him mostly? Mostly in a hook, yeah. So that is the game that he knows from A to Z.
SPEAKER_00: So the reason that he developed this is because like right now he doesn't, he said that his pain is gone, but he doesn't have time to better here right now. But so it is still, you know, like not A to Z for his
SPEAKER_04: top role same as that so well he's preempted where i was going to go with this because he's going to target that he knows that and he's going to try and take the match there and i think he can do it a number of ways and a lot of this is going to come down to mental strength i think i believe that ghanadi is an unbelievably confident guy
SPEAKER_00: unbelievably confident also this is his strategy that you know he intimidates you know we we do it that the courage everything he shows he also tries to intimidate the the guy but i don't think that it is type of guy to be intimidated
SPEAKER_04: I mean, he may be, but I don't think that he is that inexperienced. He's sort of too experienced and he's past that. He's faced every... Who though? Hasn't he faced? And he's got some aggression, you know? But sometimes the guy... Can Ferit win the match? Yeah, he can win it. Do I believe that he will believe that he can win it? I think he'll believe that he can, but he'll be probably a little doubting too.
SPEAKER_04: And I think he needs to sort of forget that and just hit with abandon to try and be the bully. I think if he showed up and was the bully, he can get a result from this. I do think that Gennady, you won't need to tell that. I think he's going to show up. He's going to try and put it down. And he knows he's versatile. My concern for Gennady is that he overextends and rushes a little. Because if you rush with Ferit and he gets a bite on you, he will finish you. So I see Gennady is favourite.
SPEAKER_00: 60-40 favorite, Gennady. Yeah, I'm sticking with that. I think 60-40 favorite. I see Ferit right now more limited than Gennady. Yes. His ability is more limited. While Gennady was about the same when he started to pull with Hermes.
SPEAKER_00: Ferit is a little bit ahead of that, but whenever I talk with Ferit, Ferit looks very, very confident. He said, just watch me. He said, this is what he says. Ferit at his best is unbelievable. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Unbelievable. I don't know he's there yet.
SPEAKER_04: I think he looks fit, and I think he's on a journey. And the biggest thing, if I was talking to Ferit privately, I would say, look, mate, don't put pressure on yourself here. If it goes your way, great. If it doesn't, don't overthink it. Just keep on the journey. Keep on the path you're on, and it won't be long. Ferit can be right there again, but he needs to just keep believing in himself and keep building the blocks, building the blocks, because he's been there before, and he can be again. He's a great arm wrestler.
SPEAKER_00: and Craig Tuller, David Samusha. For sure, you are cheering for Craig.
SPEAKER_04: I want Craig to win. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We are old friend, you know, probably, you know, him for like 20 years, 25. Yeah. 30 years. Literally. Uh, yes. I want Craig to win. Uh, but I don't want David to lose. You know what I mean? Uh, Samush is a lovely guy. Very nice. Very respectable. What's I mean? Great puller. Lovely guy. Uh, I have no, uh,
SPEAKER_04: ill will towards David Samushi at all. I respect him massively. He's a great arm wrestler. My sort of feelings towards Craig are based on being friends with the guy all over the world for 30 years. And he's sort of from that era. The fact that he's still competing as well as he is now is impressive. He's truly dangerous. And he's very, very, very aggressive hitter. Two hits. This guy can hit, then hit again.
SPEAKER_04: i think that he actually potentially starts as a favorite here you know in the mind of a lot of people i think that might be a mistake i think he's got to arm wrestle like the weakest man in the room i think david samusha is stronger than most people think i think because paul got a result against him
SPEAKER_00: that there'll be a lot of confidence from north america and they'll really believe that that craig is a heavy favorite and and i'm going to say that he isn't i think paul was paul was about 30 pounds heavier than david yeah and it was david's returning match correct after the pandemic you know and the match was very close three very close but i think that samusha is a
SPEAKER_00: will also tell you something for the rest of the world will be the favorite here yeah but since that time i think paul also improves oh yeah without a doubt yeah yeah but if we forget paul and focus on craig yeah i think that craig is
SPEAKER_04: not the favorite in this match i think that craig has to arm wrestle like the weakest man in the room he has to be elusive i think he doesn't want to doesn't don't try and bully david don't try and get into a drawn-out battle because if you do you lose because samusha is very very strong in those long drawn-out dog fights that's what he does best
SPEAKER_04: I think where Craig can win is finesse, speed, aggression, fury. Just finish the thing. Put it to bed. Don't get drawn into dogfights. Just put the thing away. Get rid of it. So you are saying that
SPEAKER_04: david has the edge yeah david is the in my mind david is the favorite i think a lot of the world in north america will see craig as a heavy favorite and craig has some real momentum and he's pulling really really well i personally think that craig is for a number of reasons the underdog
SPEAKER_04: And I think that he needs to wrestle really intelligently. I think Craig needs to bring his technical game to the fore. And I'll tell Craig that when I see him. I think that he should focus on trying to out-arm wrestle this lad. Use the experience. Use that 30 years. Put it to good use here. Imagine you're arm wrestling a man that is stronger than you when this match stops. And if Craig does that, he can win.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, let's go Rustam Bobet versus Pauline. I mean, this is a weird match, isn't it? Because you've got Pauline, who is right now, very current, rising star in the ascendancy, hungry, diligent, professional, does everything right, making the right moves, just climbing the ladder so well. Rustam? Did you expect
SPEAKER_04: paul to dominate campton i'd say to win yes no but not like the media i i never thought such thing you know no i was very surprised i was expecting it you know match you know i would spec i was suspecting uh probably gamtanadze would be the guy making the running so uh for paul to win in the fashion he did it was a bit sandra smart mask it's just not you know it was like what the wow now rostam babaev
SPEAKER_00: if you wind the clock back, there's not been many men more dangerous at his weight. I mean, phenomenal arm wrestler. But just most of the time. He wouldn't have made this match, actually. Zolev has been on record against Rustam, but very close matches. But most of the times, Rustam was more dangerous for his category than Zolev was. Correct. Because Rustam's hand and wrist ability
SPEAKER_00: was more dangerous for top rollers. He had better hook inability. Zole was also very strong too. But Zole was depending on his wrist alone while Rustem was applying inner side pressure and really crushing your arm that way as well. He had a very strong hand. So Rustem may be even more dangerous. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, for the top rollers. Against top rollers, yeah. Right now, I don't know where Rustam is at. Right now, we don't know. I understand, yeah. Somebody was asking what's his weight. If you'd have made this match 10, 15 years ago, I wouldn't have put Paul with Rustam yet. I don't think he's ready yet for that guy. He's ready for the guy that's coming. Like, what, four years ago, he pulled touchings. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that Rustam, even from the top eight, you know. I mean, top eight, Rustam lost, yes, but he was pulling in a... Against the president. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, you know, frigging giants. But I haven't seen enough of or no, I mean, some of the guys, you know, Club Torture, the guys over there, they're training with him, you know, he's pulling with the likes of Paul Maiden and the crew at Club Torture. He may be mega, but there's nobody in that club that's Paul Lynn.
SPEAKER_04: If Paul Lynn rolls up at Club Torture, he goes through that club. You know, he just does. So this is a different level. I don't know where Rustam's coming in at. I don't know how tested he is at this level. I really don't know. If Rustam comes in and is Rustam, Rustam is a heavy favourite. Can I ask you something? Don't you think that Paul may have
SPEAKER_00: better cupping ability than attachings he has has better yeah yeah because because the way that he hooked john i asked john did you go there he hook he said no he just hooked me yeah because he explodes hard to the side same with rambettes you know that guy is very explosive the one thing i would say there though and you know just as a counter shot john
SPEAKER_04: in my opinion john is being honest with you he's not lying but i think john tempers his aspiration and his approach to a match based on who he's arm wrestling and where his confidence is at it's almost like what i was saying a moment ago with the craig touye thing john can go up gears subconsciously you want to make himself more more difficult to get a hold of and he can do that subconsciously
SPEAKER_04: I do feel like the arm isn't there at that kind of level yet for Paul to be able to mix it up with a prime-level rust arm. Whilst Paul is very dangerous, he's not polished enough. He almost rushes it a little. I think Paul is for sure more explosive than Kyle Couchings. So do you know why it is important? Because him to...
SPEAKER_00: reach somehow counter Rustem's explosiveness is more chance, even though, in my opinion, Katashins most likely would beat Paul, my opinion, no disrespect to Paul. But the way that Paul enters a match is, for me, more explosive, you know, than Katashins. So what I am just saying, if somehow the strength level is close between these two gentlemen,
SPEAKER_00: then there is a chance, Paul, to really cause problems to Rustam. Absolutely. Paul could win the match, mate. We don't know where Rustam is. Paul might run Rustam over. I don't know where Rustam is. It's hard. Many people are thinking that it's not going to be, but we need to understand one thing. It's Rustam's guy.
SPEAKER_00: very smart oh he's great very very experienced you know just i mean you can only show a few guys in the world at that level you know that that this guy i mean just ran through everyone for like a decade the other thing is he dis he disables a number of paul's primary advantages against a lot of paul's opponents the explosivity you spoke about a minute ago
SPEAKER_04: if if if paul's an eight rustam's a nine you know what i mean so um if if rustam brings that which i imagine he would at least that element that makes it a more difficult match straight out the gates for for uh paul because
SPEAKER_04: Rustam is used to pulling big men and used to making a long arm from a short arm and finding where he needs to get the match to be. Then once he gets to that position, the short arm does him all the favours in the world against 90% of people. Now, Paul is an extraordinarily good talent, but he's yet to be refined and polished. Paul's next stage is to get to the very confident in a resting position.
SPEAKER_04: arm wrestle confidently and don't rush settle down take a breath and calm yourself and learn to get into the drawn out matches the one criticism i would make of paul is that sometime he is because he's at that stage of his career and he's such a competitor that he can rush for the pad
SPEAKER_04: know and there is an opportunity for him here to take something away from this match win or lose in that if he can settle himself and have almost more confidence in his in his ability and his power paul can be something very special in my opinion he's very very very strong i don't think paul's close to the finished article yet i think he's like
SPEAKER_04: If you're looking at 100% dial, I think Paul is 55, 60 of his potential. I think he's got a huge headroom. I think Paul can get a lot better yet. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: If he has 100, he's 55, 60. I don't think it's more. If he's already 55, 60, if somehow he reaches 100, he should be putting low on. I don't agree. I think that Paul's still very raw, technically. When you see Paul in bad spots, he panics. I don't think that he can get that much better. I don't think he can get that much stronger, Engin, but I think he can get that much better. I really do. Technical aspect, yes. That's what I'm talking about. I will also tell you one thing. He's an athlete.
SPEAKER_00: after certain age that like like let's look at the guys who started after certain age they are technically never becomes like uh so smooth you know like like you don't see you don't see the guy who started late you don't see them reaching like compared to the guys who started as a teenager yeah and yeah
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, by the way, my channel is demonetized, you know, right? Why? For what? For already like 10 days or two weeks because they said reuse content. And I said, on my channel, only the interviews that I have and the videos from the event that I organize. And they said that, oh, it doesn't mean the copyright. It's a reuse. We see the same content, you know, some other places.
SPEAKER_00: And I said, if you see my content at some other places, then you should be asking them, you know, even though I give permission to, you know, some people about certain level, you know, I say one round from each match for each video, they can have 10 matches from east versus west, but not all full match from one, you understand? Like, yeah. But they say, oh, you need to make a five minutes video. And I was like, okay.
SPEAKER_00: like two weeks i'm lazy i didn't even make the video i'm just kind of getting sick of it tired this is the third time they are doing i am sharing everything original whatever i organize and whatever i do interview or my channel there is nothing i don't know why it is anyway so um okay let's go let's go now okay uh corey west versus spirit left arm
SPEAKER_04: I would say Corey West. I would say Corey West. Yeah, I think Corey's really strong on that left arm. Yeah. Yeah, I think Corey West. We'll see. But I think Corey's very big. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I think he's a I think he's a I think he's a big ask there. I think he's very, very strong there. But it's got incredible experience. And he's obviously extremely powerful. He also has speed on his side. But yeah, I'd say how do you see that? I mean, I can
SPEAKER_00: I can see the possibilities, but it is the strength, you know, like we know that their ability to move, what to do, but it depends, you know, whatever they apply and what they are facing when the strength hit each other, then we do not know exactly like, you know, where the strength level. I can see that Corey is going through, I can see that Faraday is just coming here, just hit him and stop him here.
SPEAKER_00: and then tiring him and beating him or somehow Ferid to go and then Corey to, I mean, anything is possible. Like I see Corey winning sideways or Ferid is somehow hooking him. Like I see this possibility. I see the match like 50-50, either is gonna go that way or Ferid is gonna find a way this way or that way.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I've got it 55, Corey. 45 for it. And I see Corey winning it. I think it'll be a drawn-out match and I got Corey with the win. Yeah. Yeah. Big boy. Yeah. Anyway, so... So, OK, let's go last three matches. Start with...
SPEAKER_04: Michael Todd versus Ongarwe. My God, mate. So, the X Factor. Back at the table. The X Factor. Evgeny Prudnik. Pound for pound. As good an arm wrestler. As good an orthodox arm wrestler as there is drawing breath right now, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I said Michael Todd and Ongar Baer, right? Excuse me, Ongar Baer. I said Evgeny Prudny, I'm sorry. I don't know. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't know. Probably I'm tired, you know. Okay. Yeah, yeah, Michael Todd and Ongar Baer, yeah. I should have corrected you because I knew that match was coming. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but whenever I say that... Ongar Baer is very, very good at what he does, but...
SPEAKER_04: I do believe he has to finish the match early because Michael's X Factor, Michael's Kings, and how awkward it is, is going to put a level of fatigue on your arm that is very unusual. And it's hard to emulate. You don't really face people like that a lot.
SPEAKER_04: my question is or my concern is and i spoke to mike the other day mike's always upbeat and positive and my question to him was how was your arm and he said yeah really good i've been pulling you know i pulled on it a little i pulled with corey and it seems to have held up okay i'm gonna pull another event coming up i think this weekend he's pulling a couple of classes so he's obviously got confidence in it now that is not going to give him the same level of test
SPEAKER_04: the same level of stress that he's going to get on that arm, on that damaged bicep when he pulls on Gubayev. Because Kyrgyz Gali is exceptionally strong.
SPEAKER_04: Curtis Galley's got to get around the arm, he's got to hit, he's got to take command of the hand and wrist, and then he's got to come around and he's got to jump on it and press. And I don't know whether he can do that with a great deal of confidence. It's not really his skill set. Anything hanging out and going backwards, I see that he may take a pin early, he may take two pins. I do think Michael, if he can put the brakes on, puts an extreme level of fatigue on his arm.
SPEAKER_04: And Michael's being used to pulling bigger men. So he's used to the feeling of pulling an awkward, because Kurt Eagle is a big guy. He's a long levered guy. So he's used to pulling that longer levered athlete.
SPEAKER_04: And I think if he can get a strap early, doesn't get flashed, gets a strap and can put the brakes on, Michael can take the match. Kierta Galli, I believe, is dangerous off the starts. I think it's critical for Mike. Mike, I don't believe, beats Kierta Galli to the hit. I think he hits fast enough to get the slip and the strap. I don't think Kierta Galli is going to hit bang straight to the pad. I think he's going to hit four position.
SPEAKER_04: I think he's going to hit for commanding position in the hand and wrist from which he feels like he can't be beat. And if he can get that and continue to crawl up the hand and wrist of Michael to take away and flatten the palm off, turn Mike's palm up to prevent that pronator and disable it, then Keira Galley can win the match. It'll be interesting for me to see whether Keira Galley has experience of pulling that style. I don't think I've ever seen Keira Galley against a Kings movie before.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think so. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think I've ever seen him pull a highlight of the Kings. We should say open arm top row, right? Because here you can only go this far, not here, but here only. This is the furthest you are going to go. So, yeah, we should just say maybe more like open arm top row. Yeah, but I was thinking that, you know, Khedr Ghali, until I saw him against Alex Khurdecha,
SPEAKER_00: i thought that he couldn't pull in bad position because he is those type of hunter guy the positions but when when when alex took his even wrist and everything he was still able to fight with joints don't think that it's gonna be easy match no no no i think it's gonna be potentially the longest match of the night hanging a few a few days ago um they were my guests and i asked either galley
SPEAKER_00: I said, are you as good as your top eight shape? And he said, I'm stronger now. And the guy doesn't, the guy doesn't bullshit. Even when we ask him, can you beat him? He said, oh, table will show. And this, he doesn't talk like all that one and a half hour, one hour, 20 minutes podcast. Probably total of the words, not the sentence. He said probably was 20. Jesus.
SPEAKER_00: So he doesn't talk, but I ask him, are you as good as top eight when you will pull against Levan? He said, no, I'm stronger right now. So the guy is good. And Michael is trained for super heavyweights. He has the muscle memory of handling all that heavyweight pressures. So now these two are meeting.
SPEAKER_04: Very interesting match for me. Could be the longest match of the night, in my opinion. I think Kierta Galli is very dangerous in the first, the opening couple of rounds. Really dangerous. I think Mike will find a way to get the brakes on. And when he does get the brakes on, that's the test. Because I think this put... If it comes down to an arm wrestling ugly competition, Mike's winning that. You know? So if Mike...
SPEAKER_04: can get the brakes on and he can draw the match into a long affair, I think the pendulum of opportunity swings heavily in his favour. I think Curtis Galli is very dangerous out of the blocks. I give this one in terms of... The X Factor thing is that injury. That's the one. Because...
SPEAKER_00: mike isn't going to experience the same type of pressure in the same angles that he's going to get from care to galley against a bigger even a more powerful opponent like corey i don't know what's the same stress on michael is probably gonna feel much smarter i'm talking about compared to his superior weight experiences not much smarter but smarter strength application but not
SPEAKER_04: as much horsepower exactly as i see it and different i think different directions different different application of that power and if michael's bicep is fully fit i think mike i give michael the edge uh i think he's favorite he'll get a test of that this weekend to see where it's at
SPEAKER_00: If Michael's fully fit and firing all cylinders, I think that he has the edge in terms of favouritism. I do not see this as an easy match. I think Michael, as usual, is pulling a killer. Why is it that Michael doesn't receive the same respect? I'm not talking about everyone. A lot of people like him and support him. But a lot of people, he has like, I cannot say hated, but a lot of people disliked and they are looking
SPEAKER_00: opportunity to say bad things you know negative things i should say about him while all of his opponents are i would say showing respect and they are never sure of themselves and i'm not talking everyone but people like if you ask to their opponents they are like oh i don't know what to do michael is very dangerous you know you can see that whoever you said everyone is very careful you know because the guy is dangerous
SPEAKER_00: But you don't see the same, like, we're talking about like guys, like very elite guys talking highly about him. And while a good portion in the community
SPEAKER_04: that he's talking, Michael is like nothing and this and that. Why do you think that part I'm trying to understand? It's because of his unorthodox style? Okay. I think a combination of that. There's an orthodox style and Michael also is one of those guys that wears his heart on his sleeve. So you see raw emotion from him. And sometimes that raw emotion can be seen a certain way and
SPEAKER_04: it doesn't do mike any favors and then the whole mike being you know the guy that i mean when all that it was he was under the table you know what i mean the whole uh king's move antichrist movement that went out there and mike was the champion of the king's move at that time he was the he was the guy he was there honestly honestly this is also i hate but not michael but this for me is okay just just just
SPEAKER_04: Just to clear. Anyway, so we have the next one. John Brzee versus Irakli Zirakashvili. Irakli is a more dangerous opponent for John than Oleg Petrenko. Yeah. In my opinion. Much more dangerous opponent. Much more aggressive on the hand and wrist. Will target that more aggressively. As you know...
SPEAKER_04: I find it very difficult to bet against John. If John walked on water, I'd probably be all right with it. When I've seen John do stuff over the years that I've just thought, shut the how, what, where, who. John has done stuff and he shut down guys when they were there, absolute. Guys like when Dima Kochev was killing people, just murdering people. And then John,
SPEAKER_04: bullies him you know that makes a show John is something else and the one thing I will say about Irakli as much as he poses an enormous threat in his best areas he also has glaring areas of weakness and it's whether John
SPEAKER_04: can get to the spots to put the brakes on him and i always feel like john will find a way he will try something he'll sell his wrist and hand into the strap sell his wrist and hand to a degree and just bait off the the the arm apply back and side put the brakes on if he gets the brakes on john will adapt better and he will come back and win the match my money's on john
SPEAKER_00: I see Irakli as a massive threat. Massive threat. Let me tell you something. If I would choose a guy who is dangerous for John, Irakli would be one of them. Irakli is one and Ongo Baez the other. Yes, yes. In this category, in my opinion, because of the age, the signals,
SPEAKER_00: speed to go to the hands instead he is strong but he is not like explosiveness you know and he's not that quick and fast anymore so these guys are hitting exactly there and their specialty is
SPEAKER_04: So that is why this guy is one of the most dangerous guys for John. When we spoke before John pulled Kirtigalli and we were on the phone and you said, what do you think, Neil? And I said, whoa, Kirtigalli is dangerous. Now I know John was ill and I actually want to see that rematch. Yeah, why not? I really want to see it. But I wasn't surprised when Kirtigalli gave him major problems.
SPEAKER_04: Because stylistically, he's a problematic match for John. When we spoke about Petrenko, I didn't see that threat. I do see the threat from Zirakashvili. I do see Irakli being a dangerous match. Stylistically, that venomous, explosive top role is hard to get hang of. Neither John or Irakli.
SPEAKER_00: can control each other's pronators only with wrist power. That is too much for John and too much for Irakli, the hands. So it is going to be more like the outside versus outside. But doing that outside, if somehow, if the position is equal like this, flat wrist. John wins that much. John wins that one with more experience. Remember Liliev.
SPEAKER_00: lily evan john in turkey yeah yeah once he stopped here and then when he stops he can sell his own wrist he can drop his own wrist and he can pull from anywhere the guy's ability in you know what i'm just saying is second you know should not focus on the top role in john he needs to focus on
SPEAKER_00: having some control he needs to have integrity in that hand yes but if john flattens his wrist like this he's fucked that that mash is over because side pressure is and his muscle memory his experience about that kind of pulling is better no matter what what his uh right now current form is he needs to have some of here some if it topples john's totally john is like this
SPEAKER_00: he wins. If John Taupo was him, he wins. If the match is equally like this, John still wins. But as you realize, when Ongarbe and John pulled, it was not like, you know, flat, but you know, Ongarbe had some risk. So if Irakli can put John into that position,
SPEAKER_00: It will be hard. And I think John will do at some stage. I think John gets the brakes on. And I think that's how he wins the match. John, 60-40. So you are saying John is going to win? Yes. Okay. The bad part about this East versus West predictions, I can't really say everything I want to say. I know.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you know, I'm an organizer. Anything I say will be taken wrongly, especially by the haters. So, Jerry Cadaret and Swetko. So you are saying, you are, I'm sure you are saying that it's a stylistically bad matchup for Georgi Swetko, which almost everyone, including me, agrees. But Georgi is not planning to do this.
SPEAKER_00: Nothing is going to be in the hand. He's trained to go in the way that to be Jerry. But you, yes, but you to plan that, you to train for that, it doesn't automatically mean you're going to win, you know, just because you're trading there. It doesn't mean. So I don't know if this short time, two months notice is enough for Georgi to do something. But while we talk this,
SPEAKER_00: The guy is training with Sasho, the guy is training with Krasimir and Bojidar. When you talk about each of these guys, of course they are not close to Jerry, but when you train with these guys one after another, you know, type and they train to the right, right areas. And I see that his shape is big, is huge, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He is huge. And yes, like on the paper, Jerry looks favorite, but you know, okay.
SPEAKER_04: You go now. I pretty much endorse everything you just said. George is pulling with a stable of killers. I think that Jerry Catarat is the most difficult arm wrestler for a super heavyweight to face in the world. I think he's just a...
SPEAKER_04: inimitable individual. You cannot do in training what that guy does. You just can't. And it's hard to find someone to effectively train yourself with that's going to in any way emulate what we're going to see from Jerry. I believe that Jerry guts the match out and wins it.
SPEAKER_04: I believe that George is dangerous. I struggle to see him as a favourite in this. I think he's much more of an orthodox arm wrestler and he beats some guys that might beat Jerry, but I don't think he beats Jerry. I don't find him explosive enough. And I think that Jerry's beaten a more difficult man, in my opinion, in Gennady.
SPEAKER_00: I think Quikvenia is a stronger man than Georgie. A more versatile man than Georgie. As an outside skill. Only outside skill. Not as a complete aspect. Do you think Gennady is better than Georgie? Well, outside? Yeah. No. Pure outside. No. No. But that's not what's going to happen. And I... You are saying that that's not the way to be it.
SPEAKER_00: This is what Gennady said last night. Gennady said, you'll be better win quick. I asked Gennady, before your match with Jerry and after your match Jerry, your opinion change about Jerry? He said, yes. He said before the match, he said, I was in very good shape. He said, I wasn't expecting him to be that strong, he said.
SPEAKER_00: But once he said that I pulled him, if I knew what I know now, he said, he said he would directly go inside with him from the round one, you know. Which is what he should do, yeah. I mean, and that in itself pulls his problems. He said they underestimated him. And then he said, he said that, he said, Jerry is much stronger than he expected. And he puts Jerry in the top four in the world. Jerry's mega strong. He said that Levan is by far a winner.
SPEAKER_00: the ranking and he said ermes jerry and morozo he said that these are top four after levan he said but he said that he doesn't know they are very close to each other this is generally his opinion you understand and that is what exactly he said yeah yeah and and it's there's some validity to that you know that i i do feel like jerry wins this match on
SPEAKER_04: unorthodox factor you've got to remember also jerry has exceptional endurance yes yes people i mean x which will accept you you look at jerry i mean and sometimes you're like okay jerry may die during this match because the goes purple i mean last match i was genuinely concerned about jerry and wagner bortolato i thought okay someone might die
SPEAKER_04: unbelievable. Both guys blacking out. Look like we got anybody here with a defect because there's something bad. But Jerry's commitment to go past that red line just, you know, three minutes, six minutes, 10 minute you however long you got he will out. He will outlast you. He's done it many times. I have I have a very critical question for you. You know, a lot of people. I mean, I can say that most of the people
SPEAKER_00: um respect your opinion including myself anyone who knows our message respect your opinion i hope so i ain't seen the chat there might be people no no i'm not talking about i'm not talking about i say people who know in the chat also people are very knowledgeable people but sometimes some people say some ridiculous things uh we need to ignore but after your answer you may have
SPEAKER_00: some criticism or not i don't know but this is i may yeah i may have some criticism just say le one and jerry they are in strap and le one for a second is late and jerry in just say that 10 better shape than he put gennady and he is somehow puts his shoulder behind and catches the one in this position is there any possibility le one to be stuck there
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, because of the angle. Yeah. So what you are saying that it doesn't matter who you are. If Jerry catches you on your brachioradialis here. Yeah. If he bone lines you. Yeah. Yeah. Because he throws a house on your shoulder. I mean, we know what Levan's working with weight wise, but it's not a pure strict reverse hammer curl.
SPEAKER_04: Jerry's putting you outside your shoulder and he's putting a really awkward spot on you. It's a very, very difficult position to arm wrestle from. He's literally turning you onto reverse curl.
SPEAKER_04: It's a very, very awkward position. So you're not seeing Levan's power. You're not seeing Levan engaged with his... If Levan engages his arm, I believe he beats Jerry at a counter. But Jerry's... We're not talking about a straight-up match, but the pressure that Jerry can apply in his sweet spot pins anyone. Do you know why I'm asking these kind of things? Because...
SPEAKER_00: a lot of people also underestimates Jerry. A lot of people, like saying this. Yeah, when he came into the Gennady match, I was saying that. When Gennady, when I asked Gennady, and then I said, Gennady, your opinion changed? He said again, yes. He was very honest. He didn't find, like, excuses. He said, yes, he had some, like, chest injury, even from the long time. But, like, anyways, it doesn't matter. He said, this guy, Jerry, is much stronger and serious threat.
SPEAKER_00: Then what I was thinking, this is getting out, he said, so people doesn't give Jerry, like before Jerry versus getting the match, you were eating and John came, we sit. And then I said, like, how do you see, he said, if.
SPEAKER_00: Gennady tries to top-roll Jerry, he's going to lose. Oh, yeah. John Brzezinko, John knows. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He said, are you serious? I said, he said, yeah. Just wait. Just watch. Tomorrow, if Gennady goes outside, he said, just watch the match. He's going to lose. Yeah. I mean, what I am just saying, when you talk about Jerry's press, John Brzezinko,
SPEAKER_00: open his eyes open same with you same but but a lot of people are thinking that jerry ah come on he's just like he's mega and he's different he's a unicorn and also he's ace i'm team jerry all night and all day love him yeah yeah yeah yeah the guy and i'm happy that we have someone like him imagine that if jerry didn't exist in our messing i mean
SPEAKER_00: There is no one close to him about that move, you know? Correct. And anybody that meets Jerry Catarat, you spend an hour with Jerry Catarat, you'll be a fan of Jerry Catarat. Yeah. He's a great dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, he's a great character. As I always mention this, if I ask you who is the best top roller ever, I'm sure out of 100, you know, you will see, like I say, 80% John,
SPEAKER_00: 15% cobra, these taras. I'm just saying, you know, just example. Hook, yes, still it will be divided. If you say complete, of course, it will not be divided. People will say John Bersin. But one way, moving, there are a lot of people that you can compare with John. What makes John superior is he can do everything, 10, 10, 10, 10.
SPEAKER_00: while one guy does this 10 the other guy other movies seven you understand yeah so that that is the difference but about if you ask who is in history the the best that this shoulder pressure not close 100 out of 100 will tell you is jerry cut it if they know about our message if they don't know about our messaging i i understand you know gary is mega
SPEAKER_00: And we are lucky to have him. Yeah. Because it is giving us a challenge, you know, another challenge to defeat, you understand? You need to, you are thinking. He's a fascinating character, Jerry Cadaret, and he's always been underrated. I've sort of been a bit of a champion of Jerry for a lot of years. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: People who watch The Fix will know I rate Jerry very, very highly. Yes, yes. Very highly. I predicted him to win the match with Gennady. What a great match. And that's saying something, because Gennady Quitvinia, that match was what I thought that match would be and could be. I thought it would be a war. I set that match up in the WAL. If Colby had not hit, that match was coming in WAL. Oh, Gennady Jerry? Yes, it was set. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_00: you realize that we have been chatting for two and a half hours oh my goodness i'll tell you what oh dude yeah yeah but i i love it and people may be thinking that everybody in the chat is probably pissed off the whole chat will be going were you guys shut though no if they didn't like they wouldn't watch it but um they they may think that we are discussing now but
