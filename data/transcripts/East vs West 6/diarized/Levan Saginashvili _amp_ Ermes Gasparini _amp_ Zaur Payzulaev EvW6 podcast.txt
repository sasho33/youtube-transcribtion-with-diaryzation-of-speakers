Ermes Gasparini: Okay. I believe Vasily and my hands is okay. Okay. Yeah. Crazy. You feel pain here and after? No. Yes, some time I feel this.
Ermes Gasparini: When you started to do this training, yes. Exactly the same thing. Yes. OK. OK, I'm also back, finally. You also turn the phone sideways, and then we can just. There you go. Yeah. Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: So, we were gonna talk about the West versus West and you guys already started talking about who is number one, who is number two, yeah. And... My friend, there are no talking about this. All the people say already Zawar is number one. Zawar is number one, thank you. You must call him Zawar.
Ermes Gasparini: hanging hanging they told the same same man my friend what did i say yes the strap is very dangerous for lebanon listen listen listen i said strap is dangerous that it doesn't make it i said it's our number one i never said that but listen listen listen
Ermes Gasparini: You guys either go this way or totally this way. Either number one or he is not strong at all. There is no middle way. He's not number one, but he's a dangerous guy. I mean, the way that he beat Vitaly, the way that he beat Tulev, he's good. You cannot underestimate him, but he's not number one. He needs to prove this. Yeah. But the question is, Ermes, you are number two or Zar number two? Are you number two?
Ermes Gasparini: Who? You. I'm number one. You're number one? Yeah. You joking or you serious? You can meet this guy? We see. We see next month. Oh. Maybe if I had agreement, we see. But still, there is nothing official.
Ermes Gasparini: Nothing official, official. Where this match? Where this match? Hermes is not the organizer. He doesn't know, but he is ready. So you are joking aside, you think you can beat this guy? Hermes? Yes, why not? But what kind of, what kind of, like any,
Ermes Gasparini: I don't know, just tell us something that we would believe that you would beat him. Like, what do you have? Like, for example. I feel, I take his wrist. You will take his wrist? Yeah. Very, after this, very hard, but his endurance go down and I beat him. Okay, so you go and then boom, and then everything
Ermes Gasparini: He live. He live. He live. He want to win me in biceps, I think. In the hoop? Oh. Yeah. I will tell you something, for one. Seriously. When you beat Dave Chaffee, many people, many people said that
Ermes Gasparini: Levan beat him but if it would go to strap maybe there would be something they said it but so maybe in the strap Hermes is better than you who knows I don't think so you don't think so right
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, but tell me one thing. Tell me one thing. Who did you predict for winner? David you predict Dave Chaffee winner or Hermes winner? Dave Chaffee. Everybody said Dave. He thought Dave actually would win. Yeah, yeah. He thought so, yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: So, do you expect...
Ermes Gasparini: He expected from Dave Chaffee to beat Ermes like he beat Alex Kurdeca, when Dave Chaffee beat Alex Kurdeca. But he was shocked by Ermes, how he basically, when he stopped Dave, he controlled the match. And he was shocked, surprised, and he said that he beat him practically easy. So Lewand said that he predicted they would win against Ermes.
Ermes Gasparini: And now Levan is thinking that he would beat Hermes, but we see that his predictions are not that good. .
Ermes Gasparini: He said that after he met Dave Chaffee, every match that Dave Chaffee had after Levan, practically in the first two rounds, Dave Chaffee was beating all the opponents easy. And such expectation had Levan too against Dave Chaffee versus Hermes. But we all saw the outcome.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah. The question. So can we say that Levan, Hermes Gasparini, you believe Levan that you can win against anyone, it's normal. But can you say that Hermes is the person that who is the most worth to pull against you?
Ermes Gasparini: Anu, it's obvious that you are not the only one in the audience, but do you think that Hermes is better than Hermes? Do you think that Hermes is better than Hermes? Do you think that Hermes is better than Hermes? Do you think that Hermes is better than Hermes? Do you think that Hermes is better than Hermes? Do you think that Hermes is better than Hermes? Do you think that Hermes is better than Hermes? Do you think that Hermes is better than Hermes? Do you think that Hermes is better than Hermes?
Ermes Gasparini: Uh-huh. So basically he said, obviously 100% this match is worth to happen and Hermes is worth the opponent 100%. And he said the most dangerous puller in the elite level, he thinks Hermes is right now. Yes, yes, yes. Because Hermes is not only strong, we need to remember, Levan, that Hermes is coming from middleweight. So this guy from middleweight, his arm wrestling skills are...
Ermes Gasparini: with the quality of the lighter classes but with now with the heavyweight power so he is dangerous and i think he is very technical and smart at the table so i think that you need to be very careful if you pull him it's my opinion yes i know i think so yeah and hermes
Ermes Gasparini: so honestly i know we joke a lot but you are going there to beat this guy yes yes my friend why when every time when they fight they want to win this is the biggest dream for you right to be the world super heavyweight champion the whole world will recognize you after yeah i'm very i'm very curious
Ermes Gasparini: to feel his hand in the first match because for me it's impossible to go in the same way like Jeffy and he stopped him like this. Impossible for me. And if he beat me, he can't take my wrist. He beat me because for arm power.
Ermes Gasparini: much arm power inside you can you cannot take his wrist but i feel i feel i have i can't take his wrist and if i take his wrist his power go down
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, he understands, yeah. Oh, he talk about only wrist wrist. I know, he go and cook. What?
Ermes Gasparini: he's basically said exactly the same thing in georgia he said that we know hermes is saying he's going to take leon's wrist wrist wrist he's completely constantly saying grease but leon knows that hermes will go in hook in first round
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, my friend. Why not? I give you the last match in the hook if you want. The last match you can try in the hook after 5-0. When I 5-0, you 0, yes?
Ermes Gasparini: Me five, you zero. Levan, do you remember? Do you remember, Levan, you have a promise yourself that you said you are not going to give one round to anyone? Remember, right? And but if Ermes beats you five rounds, you will keep your promise because you don't give one round, you give five rounds.
Ermes Gasparini: there's no way he's gonna give him any rounds no no no remember remember this word
Ermes Gasparini: After he lost the first round, he might go crazy, don't understand anything, total panic, and maybe he can't continue the match. Because too much panic inside the mind. You understand, Engie? I understand, but I don't know if Lewand understands.
Ermes Gasparini: He understood that. He said, yeah, it will be like that. Yeah. Yeah. For serious, if Erme somehow takes the first round, then he will be in panic. What the hell? Yeah. But I am not number one. This match is for the top five, not number one.
Ermes Gasparini: Even if you beat him, it's this match is not for top one. So yeah, yeah, no, no. I mean, I mean, yeah, let's be I know. People may have opinions, people may have opinions, but the things needs to be proven, you know, to me, in my opinion, I mean, for sure.
Ermes Gasparini: the number one right now, the rank deserves is Levan for sure. Then we have like dreamers, like, like Hermes, you know, just thinks that he's number one, you know. He's teasing you man. You see, you see.
Ermes Gasparini: Leon just underlined how handsome Ermes is, and being number one for Ermes would fit perfectly. He's so handsome, he will look like a real good man. Okay. Ermes, if you give him the latest model of Ferrari, the car,
Ermes Gasparini: Maybe. One round he's going to give him. One car. One car each round. Only one. Yeah, one car, one round. You're going to give him a Ferrari. You're going to give him a Ferrari. I want a Ferrari Roma. Ferrari Roma. Only one. Ferrari Roma. No, I give you much. Ferrari Roma and much.
Ermes Gasparini: No other car. No Lamborghini, nothing. Oh, Ferrari, probably. No, no problem. One will be enough. And Levan, when he gives you this, you're going to give him the whole match or one round? Yes, yes, the whole match.
Ermes Gasparini: But it's better to show your hard match difficulty, not like this 6-0. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Ermes Gasparini: do you need to give Ferrari to Lewand to win that match? What's happening? The guy doing something and now you are making a deal about it like you need such thing. Oh. My friend, I'm joking now. We see, we see. If there are agreement, we see. Okay. You will see the face of Lewand total white.
Ermes Gasparini: Total wide, wide. I had one choice. I know. I don't want to talk. Hermes, he has personal message for you. Now he's saying in English, in German. That's fine.
Ermes Gasparini: I don't know. He's saying that don't you have like when you are preparing for Levan right now, just to be honest, like to swear on the Bible, you know, let's say, be really honest. Don't you have any like a fear going into this match? That was what Levan was asking. Like when you are preparing for him, you know what's coming. Don't you have a fear? Are you scared, my friend? Huh?
Ermes Gasparini: Giro. Giro? Giro, man. There was a question, yeah. Opposite. Too much fire inside. Too much fire. Laman, you are favorite. Yes. Do you think that if you watch this match from outside, who has something to lose? Who has something not to lose? You know what I mean?
Ermes Gasparini: I don't think that Hermes has anything to lose, but what if you lose? It's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite, it's not your favorite,
Ermes Gasparini: So he understands
Ermes Gasparini: if Lewand wins, people will say, we knew Lewand would have won anyways. But if he loses to Hermes, it will be like as if he fell from the sky from the helicopter or like an airplane and just like crashed down to the earth. That would be such a crash if he loses to Hermes. And then he also said that he invades Hermes
Ermes Gasparini: uh in in such a manner he said that if I was in Hermes place and if it was like vice versa and if Hermes was favorite and I was underdog uh that's what he would prefer technically because he would be way more motivated and like you said nothing to lose but everything to gain yeah yeah yeah I agree so because now you ask him if he is afraid fear so that that's what I am saying from one side yes
Ermes Gasparini: He is afraid, my friend. He is afraid? He is afraid to me. Look at the face. Look. He's saying that all in all, we are joking now, like we are friends and stuff. But when it comes to the table time, you know, like the match, the day
Ermes Gasparini: it will be total war yeah yeah yeah yeah he knows from both sides ermis will be also
Ermes Gasparini: He wanted to make it clear for the audience, for viewers who are watching us right now, that it doesn't matter how good a friendship they have, they are really good friends, but when it comes to the match, he doesn't want people to think, viewers, that since they are talking so much good things about each other and laughing and stuff, that they will take anything less than serious. It will be totally serious, and Hermes and they both will have a war as much as possible, 100%. Listen, my friend,
Ermes Gasparini: These two, they both are very high level at this and they have their dreams. They have their dreams and Levon's dream to write his name on the history with the golden letters, you know, a man that stayed at top, just say 10 years, 15 years without losing even single rounds. That is his dream. And whenever I ask him, you know, sometimes like you want to pull this guy, he says, no,
Ermes Gasparini: I will be 100% ready every match. I'm going to give 110%, he says. So he's taking everyone so seriously. And Lawan, I see, is 100% professional, 100%. And it just shows him how careful he is. And then whenever I look at Ermes, Ermes is very passionate, you know.
Ermes Gasparini: a person and we know how much fire he has in him and he also dreams to be number one and this is Hermes if they set the match he said nothing official yet if they said this match um this is his biggest biggest because just imagine Hermes if Levan is that person that was undefeated 10 years and then I mean he has potential to go you understand
Ermes Gasparini: you would be the one to put a break and stop him you will go in the history the man who stopped leon saginashvili so this is your biggest match ever yeah you are leon's biggest match as of now today right now you are proven number two after you didn't even lose one round against
Ermes Gasparini: Dave Chappie, who is super powerful guy, you didn't even lose the first round. It also proved how strong you are. So this is a huge match, and I have no doubt that you guys will go there. I know we are joking now. At that moment, everything will be like a battleground, you know? Yes. Yes. Telebon wants to say something. Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: I am in a different situation, because I don't want to go back to Aleksandr Tskhurtsevich, and I don't want to go back to my position in the modern world. In my opinion, I don't want to go back to my position in the modern world.
Ermes Gasparini: uh-huh so he said so he said he wanted to point out the one very important fact
Ermes Gasparini: uh he's in totally slightly i would say different position uh than hermes or any other puller and he explained how if hermes hermes is capable of let's say if hermes loses to kudecha or someone else hermes can quickly like progress and beat someone else other guy very elite and quickly gain the position which he had lost from from previous matches for example but in lebanon's case if he loses to hermes or to anyone
Ermes Gasparini: he cannot get back to the position he was previously before he lost because of these non-consecutive wins, no round loss. So once it's lost, it's lost. So he's in a different position. Yeah, so he shouldn't make mistakes. This is where... Exactly, exactly. Yeah, streak and then... Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why there are more pressure. And Levan, you're going to beat this guy right there, the Italian guy?
Ermes Gasparini: He's going to beat this very handsome Italian guy. Very? Handsome. Handsome. Beautiful. Handsome. Handsome. Good looking. Good looking. Beautiful guy. Thank you, my friend.
Ermes Gasparini: Hermes, no one is wondering, are you trying to gain the weight? Are you going to be bigger, like more weight?
Ermes Gasparini: i prefer to to be to be more clean than too much fat because if i want i can i can go to 140 kilo but with the fat more more a lot fat but there are no change because the the muscle is the power you understand yes yes okay he's good
Ermes Gasparini: But the important thing is what do you feel, you understand? Because maybe in my situation, maybe in 140 kilos, I don't have the same power as in 130 kilos. Maybe in 130 kilos, I have more power than in 140, you understand? Yes, it's true. For example, if you look at your weight,
Ermes Gasparini: wow he agrees with you ermis completely what you said he understands and he said that several days ago he was 192 kg that's the highest i have ever heard and then now he's dropping down back to weight like you said not many fat just more muscle and less fat so he's dropping the weight down
Ermes Gasparini: How many kilo he want to come if there are a match? He says he doesn't want to be more than 185 kg, not more than that. But I will ask also maybe what's the minimum, like minimum .
Ermes Gasparini: So, no way below 175, and so it will be Hermes like 175 or 85, like 10 kg plus minus, you know, something like this. I saw him, I don't remember, when he fought with Lality, very good shape. He was very good shape.
Ermes Gasparini: uh he said against a lot of things in 2019 in december yeah i know he was 164. but a very good uh
Ermes Gasparini: uh um like six pack was visible he had like very very less uh significantly less uh fat than he has now like back then it was like really toxic 60 kg he could see his stomach muscles it's 64 it was already visible he said back then yeah wow and and it's better for endurance if you have not too much fat
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You are the man by the end of the world.
Ermes Gasparini: So Hermes, when you said about this endurance, he wanted to say, surprisingly, he doesn't understand how it's happening, but surprisingly, no matter how much fat he has, like how much more weight he has or less, his endurance stays the same.
Ermes Gasparini: said maybe because uh he has done more very very high amount of presses and like arm wrestling movements and it's like already in muscle memory or something he doesn't understand no matter how much weight he has maybe maybe that is because he didn't have any serious test that's what i wanted to say but i didn't say yeah he's too strong you understand when you are too strong you don't really go into the endurance game
Ermes Gasparini: you need to really play something very near to your power so that we can measure your, when you are too strong. I mean, like you understand, even a guy with a good more because he will be facing more power. Like if I can, if I have very good endurance, but my max is 30 kilo, but if all the time, 40 kilo comes my arm, you know, I just get exhausted. You understand? Yes, exactly.
Ermes Gasparini: Yes, that's right. Now, in the form of Iraq, it's like we're going to America, and we're going to have to go back to Europe, because it's not as easy as it used to be in Iraq, and it's a challenge.
Ermes Gasparini: uh so he said he has technically actually such such a sparring partner obviously iraqi and he wants he's so strong in tremendously good form right now how strong he is actually uh he may even be able to take typical that's what he said it could be possible right now uh uh
Ermes Gasparini: I heard mistakenly, Levan corrected me. So he actually, Irakli is in such a good form that he would suggest John to stay in USA, technically, just avoid the match. We will talk about that later. We will talk about later. But what I am just saying that no matter how good Irakli is,
Ermes Gasparini: Irakli is not at Lewan's level, not at all, no way. Irakli is not number two guy, number three guy in the world, not number four guy. Maybe number 15 guy, because there are many super heavyweights. I know he is strong, but he is 100, 500 kg guy. I want to ask Lewan... Oh no, for me he is number... inside in the top ten. Number ten? Nine, ten, like this. And where is John?
Ermes Gasparini: Moralespe. Tricky question, very tricky question was that. Very difficult question. Yeah, okay, okay, then we will go there. I want to ask Lewan first. I have a question for you.
Ermes Gasparini: He asks you, how will be your reaction if you see that Irakli beats John and then John beats Tsiplenko? What will be your reaction?
Ermes Gasparini: uh it would be but just the thing is to to answer this question i need to share my uh predictions about this match and one of the match i am organizing and the other match is somewhere else i don't know if it is right for me to uh answer that but anyway so
Ermes Gasparini: Levan, sorry, I mean, I cannot answer that, but it would be like, Iraq would be incredible. But still, we need to prove it. We need to prove it. And Levan, what was your prediction when Iraq pulled against Tatar-Chinx? What did you think when you heard about Iraq? What did you think that would happen? I didn't think that Iraq would win. But it is clear that Iraq will win.
Ermes Gasparini: Thank you very much.
Ermes Gasparini: so he said he thought iraqi would win he thought iraqi would win but uh after the assumption like conclusion he concluded that uh todzilla is really really uh awkward opponent for iraqi iraqi style like stylistic then he also said that
Ermes Gasparini: Irakli is actually saying that, admitted back then he had the failures, like some many mistakes he did, and now in time he gets better and he fixed those mistakes and Irakli would beat Tozilla this time now, if the match happens. He's saying that Irakli back then and Irakli now, it's like two different
Ermes Gasparini: yeah yeah but john is also someone to not to underestimate you know i'm not saying iraq we will talk about it but before we go there we will start talking about east versus west but the last question for levan levan you said uh like zaur um you said you can beat hermes
Ermes Gasparini: And I know that you are not taking seriously when people make a comment about Zaur is number one. I understand that. But do you think Zaur is a strong guy? Yes, absolutely. I will ask your honest opinion. How do you think about if Zaur and Hermes would pull? There is a chance for Zaur to win or not at all, in your opinion?
Ermes Gasparini: I can't say that this is a bad thing. But I can say that Zauri is the first in Russia. I think Russia is better, but I don't think so. If a Russian sportsman and a Russian sportsman and a Russian sportsman and a Russian sportsman and a Russian sportsman and a Russian sportsman and a Russian sportsman and a Russian sportsman and a Russian sportsman and a Russian sportsman and a Russian sportsman
Ermes Gasparini: I think it's possible that such a person can be found, but he is not in the right place. It is said that Mogo Laletin is a Turk. It is also said that all this is related to the Turks. The Turks have a very different specificity, and the Arphites have a very different specificity. The Arphites have a very different way of living.
Ermes Gasparini: So, there's no doubt that Zaur is strong. He's looking strong, and everyone believes that he is really strong. There's no doubt. But, however,
Ermes Gasparini: There is several different things Lewand talked about. One of the latest he said was Zaur has proven himself in tournaments. Zaur in armfight mode, Zaur in like a Vendetta style of supermatch mode with different rounds, multiple rounds, we don't know.
Ermes Gasparini: We don't know. That's one thing he said. Another thing he also said, since Zaur competes in Russia, and given circumstances, right now Russia is, we know, cannot compete outside of Russia, we cannot determine how good Zaur actually is. Just to compare him to Russian pullers, okay, we can say he's number one in Russia, but we don't know how good he is relative to the rest of the world.
Ermes Gasparini: even though Russia is a very big country in terms of armistice as well. And then he said, this match needs to happen, Ermes versus Zaur. It has to happen, it will happen. And because of this inconsiderate decision of how good Zaur is, he cannot say who would beat who in Ermes versus Zaur. So he's saying that it may be a good match.
Ermes Gasparini: It's a good match. He said this match needs to happen. He started saying it. I also had a conversation with Zaur. I cannot say everything, but Zaur feels confident. He didn't say it, but what I understood is that he feels himself a little bit more prepared for someone like Levan, but for someone like Hermes,
Ermes Gasparini: he said is that Hermes is only 130 kilo and he is not even a super heavyweight and wow he said he thinks that he wouldn't be and then whenever I talk with Hermes Hermes said you know Hermes is smiling right now yeah my friend it's better it's better like this my friend
Ermes Gasparini: It's very beautiful to look at the face of my opponent after they lose with me. Very beautiful. I know that, I know that. Super beautiful. And his face. His face and my head. It's beautiful to look at his face. Yeah. After you beat Dave,
Ermes Gasparini: You guys made a clip and put on social media everyone who said that they was going to win. And then you posted them. You are a terrible person. I don't know why. Let's talk a little bit, Emir. Let's talk about West versus West. For my opinion, it's very strong. It's very, very strong.
Ermes Gasparini: But it's too much difficult to compare with us. Because, yeah, he beat very easy Shilaev, but Shilaev is very, very strong puller, very good person, but his wrist is not very strong. And I showed the training with Denis Tiplenko.
Ermes Gasparini: He started very speedy, then he took his hand very down and... Maybe you can beat me, Jengi, like this. If I take it like this. I beat you too. Yeah. Maybe if I take it like Dennis with you, maybe you beat me in top, bro. Really, my friend?
Ermes Gasparini: You know, my friend, for the top, if they take it down, very down, your bone, wrist, you can open it very easily. You know, my friend. I understand. For me, LeJuan right now proven number one. And then top three is also like some guys, you know, that needs to pull, you know, like some other guys needs to pull. But I cannot say.
Ermes Gasparini: Whatever. Anyway, so somebody is asking you, Lewan, what do you think is the difference between Devon and Hermes? Like I said before, Devon is the Hermes choice. Pluses and minuses. He just said there's a huge difference, big difference. But what are the differences? The style, obviously.
Ermes Gasparini: First of all, style. Stylistically, they are different? Yes, Hermes is different from Devin Danzaev. He is very fast, explosive. Devin Danzaev, obviously, we know, goes from the wrist to the top roll. He is Hermes' top roller. He is very fast, explosive. Devin Danzaev is very fast, explosive. Devin Danzaev, obviously, we know, goes from the wrist to the top roll. He is Hermes' top roller.
Ermes Gasparini: The one we know is not Dr. Guy. Yeah. So speed, another thing is speed is the difference. Well, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Ermes Gasparini: We have heard about the rumors, like people would say, maybe haters, maybe just random fans, that Devon getting old and therefore getting less and less level in the arm wrestling, but he proved those people wrong when he pulled Prudnik.
Ermes Gasparini: on such a high level he showed his number one in that weight category even though he dropped his weight so so basically those two things were the main difference uh he answered he also wanted something to it
Ermes Gasparini: For the Russians, it is a kind of tradition that they are not the only ones, they are the only ones who have their own culture. For example, when I was a child, I used to go to school, I used to go to school, I used to go to school, I used to go to school,
Ermes Gasparini: It was like a bomb. It was like a big bomb. But then you realize that your career is over and you realize that it was a little too late when you were very young, and you were very strong, and you were very young, and you were very young, and you were very young, and you were very young, and you were very young, and you were very young, and you were very young, and you were very young, and you were very young, and you were very young, and you were very young, and you were very young,
Ermes Gasparini: It's not that I don't like it, it's just that I don't like it. I don't like it at all. I don't like it at all. I don't like it at all. I don't like it at all.
Ermes Gasparini: give me one minute i need to change because my telephone is uh okay okay go ahead i change it with the one minute i will i will translate meanwhile yeah uh so um uh he said uh he said that um he wanted to say one thing about the uh russian community enormously they tend to uh
Ermes Gasparini: overestimate and over admire their pullers russian pullers and then he brought the uh example of vital in the latin when he beat vitale in top eight
Ermes Gasparini: uh six zero he said that after the commentaries he read after the match it was like russians were like almost showing as if as if vitaly had like really barely almost there to beat leon which was not the case and then it took vitality's confidence in such level that he also believed that he was really really that much strong that that close to him
Ermes Gasparini: And in time, this had very negative effect on Vitaly. And he met by death when we saw Vitaly was ranked like number two or so, but eventually he fell down and he's not number two right now in the world. And he said he doesn't want same to happen to Zao.
Ermes Gasparini: because he doesn't want to. Right now, Russians are saying Zaw is number one. Zaw is so strong. Zaw is this, Zaw is that. And he doesn't want Zaw to be affected negatively by this overconfidence. I talk with Zaw. I talk with Zaw. Zaw knows that he needs a little bit more to get ready. Yeah, that's good. Zaw is super strong, super strong, especially in the strap. His back pressure and side pressure is super strong.
Ermes Gasparini: but again you know i i think that like but just remember you know every country the people they they also really because the some patriotic feelings get involved same with the georgians same all the time same americans you know like when they wanted like for example they thought that there was there was would be
Ermes Gasparini: morozov but morozov who can beat him so we always a little bit subject not not objective you know about our countrymen so it is kind of normal you know but it doesn't change zaur is a super strong guy but in my opinion is not number one and my opinion if you ask zaur himself would say that leon is number one i don't know i will have interview with him and i can ask him but
Ermes Gasparini: know something needs to be proven proven you know before before we can i can promise you i can promise you when i meet zao i will see six zero you will be yes yeah but but i will tell you something it is normal you think this way
Ermes Gasparini: and you would say listen you would say this about everyone in the world because in your mind not only zaur no no no not zaur that's not the reason why he said it he will explain himself he's really gonna beat him six now he's really gonna beat him six now i understand but is if you ask him is he gonna beat uh hermes five one
Ermes Gasparini: He will say this about everyone. This is not about Paul. This is about everyone. If he ever pulls Paul and Paul beats him,
Ermes Gasparini: he promises this to all community right now we are live he will quit the sport le one will quit the sport if zao beats him if that match happens but my friend you don't understand nothing because i will beat you why can he not pull for the number two you know it's okay normal after you beat le one
Ermes Gasparini: levan and zaur will pull for number two yeah yeah yeah he did not say number one match so yeah did you realize that whenever i asked levan levan couldn't say that he would beat the six zero he says about zaur when it comes to you he is very careful about not to talk you know yeah italian mood scary my friend oh scary
Ermes Gasparini: In Italy, the mood is like this. I love Italy. I love Italy. It will be good. It will be good.
Ermes Gasparini: but weird enough. He says that he understands, like he said, he has a huge interest in the sport and he understands that despite of the Italian national team in football that they could not perform as they wanted in the World Championships, Hermes wants now to make his country proud in armors. But despite that,
Ermes Gasparini: he nah that's not gonna happen what is already in the final italy now no who is in final my country is already in the final italy final of what uh finally with georgia you mean yes
Ermes Gasparini: Oh, he wishes those two countries met in finals in football as well. Because he meant it because most likely because of the Georgi is not that well performing in football as in arm wrestling. So that's why he wished that. Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: Levan, do you suggest Hermes to stick in football instead of arm wrestling? What, Hermes? Ping pong, if you want. Ping pong. Ping pong. I'm very slow. I'm very slow.
Ermes Gasparini: In real life football, he's very slow for football, but in PlayStation football, he can compete with you, MS, if you want, yeah. Call of Duty, I have a Call of Duty. Call of Duty, Moxo.
Ermes Gasparini: my friend hanging started with the serious uh yes yes yes yeah yeah but when levan is talking about you and armresting he cannot be serious he doesn't take you seriously what can i do he doesn't he doesn't feel uh
Ermes Gasparini: My wish, my power, she is never feeling like that. You understand? Levan wanted to give you a message. Engin, stop teasing Hermes like that or Hermes will be very strong in the match and he may even beat you. So stop teasing him like this. Don't make him angry.
Ermes Gasparini: listen listen 99 if they they set this match it's not set i know it's not set yet but if they said i will be dead yeah really yes of course your corner you know
Ermes Gasparini: leon is so disappointing now man i translated that you would also be there uh he asked yeah yeah yeah um i i want um 20 okay after you win okay yeah okay
Ermes Gasparini: you're gonna be the referee or something no no no I will coach him I will coach him after he beat the one I will get the 20 you know anyway so let's let's start with the West versus West um okay let's start with versus left arm uh Levan first of all when Ferit went to uh Chechnya
Ermes Gasparini: two nights he had to spend in the airport because there are problematic flights. He wanted to ask you about that something.
Ermes Gasparini: No, so he wanted your opinion about Ferit's performance because he expected Ferit to do better than that. Yes, but both Gashevsky and Hermes, two nights in the airport, flights cancelled, next night they slept at the airport, he was just totally done. I'm not saying... Ferit, he meant Ferit.
Ermes Gasparini: When we agreed about 20%, my mind stayed there. OK, let's start. Khorivest and Ferit, left arm. Khorivest and Ferit. Inside or outside? Outside. Outside he will go. OK.
Ermes Gasparini: because i think the inside the core is very strong but his wrist is not strong it left her man yeah yeah okay i think it's the same maybe the strap he can go on the hook maybe
Ermes Gasparini: But if Ferit goes very back pressure, I can hope a little bit that he will win. Okay, and then if we go now, that's a very good question for you, Levan. Chen Xiao, David Arabuli. Bye, David.
Ermes Gasparini: Thank you very much. I would like to say that this is a very special period. It is a very special year. It is a very special year. It is a very special year.
Ermes Gasparini: So he said that about David.
Ermes Gasparini: at the beginning of his preparation for Chen's show, they could not see the results of how they actually wanted to see. Davit did not perform well. But lately, these last 10 days, last one week, 10 days or so,
Ermes Gasparini: We are seeing the results of David's performance and it's really, really in a really good shape. And he also teased us that on his YouTube channel, Lewan will upload the video soon, very soon, where he shows this battle between him, Irakli and David. And he also teased he will beat Irakli at some point, but then David beats Lewan. So the video will be soon on Lewan's channel.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, you see that, Ermes? You see that, Ermes? He pulled me one time directly and David beats him. So you're going to win. You're going to win. Don't think so, Ermes, no. I don't know who will win in this fight. Yeah, do you know David Arabuli? David Arabuli was around Sander's level.
Ermes Gasparini: three years ago, around that level. But now, I don't know. He comes usually to watch and to translate, but he didn't really pull. I don't know. Yeah, you don't know his performance. Yeah, I understand. And it's an important match. Alizhan Muratov and Petrenko Levan. Muratov and Petrenko.
Ermes Gasparini: Petrenko is a favorite in this case. Petrenko would win. And Hermes? If Petrenko can stop the very fast movement of Muratov, he will win. Okay, so you are saying that Petrenko is stronger, but you don't know if you can stop him?
Ermes Gasparini: or not. Yeah, because Muratov is very fast. But it's a close match. Close match, right? I will tell you something. Even if you stop him and he goes inside hook, I don't think it will be an easy match because Muratov is inside also strong. Very good match. Okay, so let's go Levan. Gabriela and Barbora.
Ermes Gasparini: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Ermes Gasparini: So his prediction in this case is inconclusive because he has never seen actually how good Barbora is. But he also added that the Georgi, like his community around Levan, everybody is telling that Barbora is a really big deal and very good puller. And so considering how the people say, it's going to be a really good match. But he doesn't know, so it's inconclusive decision for him. So I guess 50-50. Levan, she's...
Ermes Gasparini: 185 and he is 125 kilos. Oh, he, he, she has been stronger than Ernest. And then you, my friend, if you are stronger than me, then you too.
Ermes Gasparini: Levan, she will be the female Levan very soon. One year later, two years later, she will be female Levan. And what's your opinion, Hermes, in this matter? This girl, where does she live? Slovakia. Slovakia. Slovakia. I don't know. I think...
Ermes Gasparini: I think Gabriela is the favorite, but I don't know. Okay, so let's go another match. Craig Tullier, Samushia. Do you know Craig, Hermes? Yeah, yeah, I think Samushia. Samushia. And you, Levan? I would say Samushia is the best.
Ermes Gasparini: Craig Tullier is an American. He was born in 1990, and he is the first American. Yes, that's right. I guess LeBron cannot hear us. He's fixed it. Craig Tullier was born in 1990, and he is the first American. Yes, that's right. If I remember correctly,
Ermes Gasparini: Hey, my friend, look at this. Hermes, Hermes, Hermes, don't scare Lewand. Come on. Shaw me your forehead.
Ermes Gasparini: He's gonna undress him now.
Ermes Gasparini: so uh about craig he was unsure about who we were talking about yeah yeah yeah and then he said the guy with the good haircut or something this is the second time that you know hermes is doing striptease to his opponents
Ermes Gasparini: Ooh, listen. Ermes, Ermes, you're doing like this. Ermes, you're doing like this. The guy is doing like this. Don't bring your elbow to the camera like this. Bring your elbow there. Bring your elbow there. Yeah, okay. Ooh. It's going to be close. Look at the forearm. Come on. Imagine this hand. The big hand, you know, his forearm is... Yeah, but you saw his brachioradialis, right, Levan?
Ermes Gasparini: Is Brachii radialis? He's going to take it. Very smart. Where is Brachii radialis? He said it's combined to the biceps. That's why it's not easy to see.
Ermes Gasparini: He also said, Roman forgot to translate. He said, you will see his brachioradialis when he lifts you up from the table. Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: About this Craig Tullier, he is not unsure if he knows the same person we are talking about. Like a guy with a good haircut and then like a stylistically he pulls really nice. I guess he knows who Craig Tullier is. So I will ask about prediction.
Ermes Gasparini: I don't know, because I don't know the American language, I don't know how to speak it, I don't know the technical language. I would like to say that in my opinion, the Georgi language and my language are not the same, and I would like to say that it is definitely not the same.
Ermes Gasparini: Despite the fact that Samushia is his countryman, he's a good friend, he would say 50-50 because lately he saw this Western Crac Tullier pulling and he said he finds it very good, good stylistic armwrestler versatile and he says 50-50. He doesn't want to show off like encouraging only his country, so 50-50. Okay, okay, that's interesting.
Ermes Gasparini: And then we go Rustam Babayev, Pauline. Rustam. Rustam. I hope I showed the interview yesterday or two days before, I don't know. Yesterday. Two days ago, yeah. Or three days ago. And I hope...
Ermes Gasparini: he is in his best shape. I think he will win. Paulinho is a nice guy, a very good guy, but Rustam for me is a legend in the hook. You remember, he...
Ermes Gasparini: He stopped Dennis C. Plank on his left. You remember? Yeah, when he was tired. Left-handed. Left-handed. He won with the right. It's amazing. And Lewand, how did you see that match? Lewand, I heard Lewand said also bye-bye. I heard Lewand say bye-bye. I heard Lewand say bye-bye.
Ermes Gasparini: No, Pauline is a great person, she is a great person, but it is also very good that Rustam is here and that he came here to tell us about what happened to Rustam.
Ermes Gasparini: yeah he he said paul is a is a very good uh puller very nice guy as well personally but he's so happy that finally seeing rustam competing like bruce i'm getting back he he doesn't let himself to think otherwise that was come bruce i'm gonna win so yeah but i will win this one yeah and then let's go right down very tough to call
Ermes Gasparini: But it's the same as Gerard Mowbray. It's the same as, let's say, being in the airport for two days and having a lot of problems, but it's the same as Gerard Mowbray.
Ermes Gasparini: So he said that
Ermes Gasparini: Obviously, he understands about these airport things, that it fatigued Ferit and did not let him compete in the way he wanted. But he thinks even if Ferit shows off in a better shape than we saw him last time, he still would say slightly Genadi would win, slightly as a favourite.
Ermes Gasparini: But he also said, obviously, Genadi is going to take this match seriously. And if Genadi is serious enough and training enough, in that case, Genadi will win. Well, Genadi is a very strong fighter. He is a very strong fighter. Ferit is a very strong fighter. Ferit is a very strong fighter. He is a very strong fighter. Genadi is a very strong fighter. He is a very strong fighter.
Ermes Gasparini: So he underlined two styles. First style, he said if match goes in hook, if Genadi manages to turn him in hook, no chance for Ferit. And then he said only chance for Ferit maybe if he top rolls and takes Genadi's wrist, maybe. But then he also said that we know Genadi can also flop wrist press. So he still says that Genadi would be victorious in the different. Levan, do you think that possible Genadi to top roll Ferit or no?
Ermes Gasparini: He still thinks that Genadi will not go in that direction. And he also said if he was Genadi's place, he would also try to go inside, not outside. And Ernest?
Ermes Gasparini: I think if Ferit can open the wrist of Genadi, I don't know if he can use the press. Genadi? No, no, no. Ferit. Why he needs to do that? You mean like this or this? This.
Ermes Gasparini: oh okay i don't know if he can use this technique you are saying that even if very top will seem he may have problem to finish him okay i understand yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so how do you see that match close or yeah not you yeah very close but i think another is likely favor yes okay i understand i understand and let's let's go some other matches quickly
Ermes Gasparini: any opinion about this one oh his internet is lagging he cannot hear properly okay hermes sorry aydar khan is from kazakhstan current 75 kilo
Ermes Gasparini: world champion he he beat uh uh daniel prokopchik in the final at waff ah and i understand this year yeah this year yeah very very close match in the final i remember ah not close he just went so quick very fast yeah yeah he's very fast yeah before he must finish yeah yeah i think um
Ermes Gasparini: me the name of minda minda is a favorite he can okay do you do you know do you know uh unfortunately he doesn't know okay he may have seen him pulling but as a name it doesn't come in okay i will go to the last three matches that
Ermes Gasparini: four matches. One is Corey West and Arif Levan. Right-handed match, yeah. Arif. He said Arif. He can even bet like 100% he's sure Arif will win. Arif will win, he's saying. Oh, okay. Me too. Can I ask you something, Levan? Why do you think Arif will win? Why? Like, technically, can you explain why?
Ermes Gasparini: He said that Arif
Ermes Gasparini: experience. Lewand is speaking from his own experience. Arif is really good at taking wrist from top and he assumes that he's going to do the same in this case to Corey. He's going to take Corey's wrist and then finish. That's basically what he expects. And how do you see Hermes? The goal is very fast. Explosive. I think Arif is dangerous
Ermes Gasparini: If you cannot take his wrist, if he has his wrist, then I think his side pressure is very strong. Well, I don't think so. If Zdilov can do it, I think he can do it. But I don't think he can do it. I don't think he can do it. I think he can do it. I think he can do it. I think he can do it. I think he can do it. I think he can do it.
Ermes Gasparini: He remarked that Arif is such a puller, if you as an opponent of Arif are trying to go inside hook, he's most likely end up taking your wrist. And that's why stylistically that's going to happen. Arif has hard times against top pullers like Hermes, but in hook, if you want to go in hook, that's what Arif wants you to do. That's what he said. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Usually that's how it happens during his career.
Ermes Gasparini: so okay let's go last a few matches one ongar versus michael totes but it is 105 kilo yeah i i told this about the kg as well i guess he didn't know here i will repeat myself
Ermes Gasparini: He anticipates both opponents as very strong. But lately, I mean, he watches Michael as well all the time. So he knows that Mike is technically right now in better shape.
Ermes Gasparini: that's what he said so slightly opponent's favorite is michael in this case michael is slightly favorite yes he said mike is your favorite i don't know if michael he's beside his total recovery he said he will be okay you know okay yeah
Ermes Gasparini: How do you see that match? I think maybe Ongarbaev has more hand control, but I don't think he can finish the match. It's a very good war, but I think when
Ermes Gasparini: uh okay somebody said that zaur is in the chat but i don't see him oh zaur said something i cannot read i don't know how to read can somebody translate what zaur said if it is real zaur
Ermes Gasparini: There is one fake Zaur also in community, like fake YouTube channel. Speaks English all the time. Zaur doesn't speak English. One guy wrote here in Russian. He wrote Zaur. I haven't seen. I could technically translate for you. I haven't seen it. And then we can talk about Jerry Cadorette versus Swetko Levan. I think Jerry will. Jerry will? Jerry will do this.
Ermes Gasparini: Wow. And you, Hermes? Jerry is super confident to beat me, Lewa, everybody. Ah, no, he didn't say about his confidence. Yeah, very confident. About you, yes. He didn't say about Lewa. He told in the hoop he beat Lewa. See, I will say something here again. You couldn't find?
Ermes Gasparini: yeah i i i found it i i think this is fake account actually because uh he he was speaking english as well no here it's only in russian i see i i saw he uh he's saying that uh he wants me to tell you that it's actually he like it means like uh okay
Ermes Gasparini: Okay, I see something here. Up there, yeah. He said, he was talking to someone else in the chat. He said that reaction will be actually vice versa when it happens completely different. So it could be referring to any other guy's comment. It's not...
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, I just need to read the whole consequence of the chat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And there's also once he's saying Levan have no chance in English. He's also saying. Oh, yeah. Time will show Levan.
Ermes Gasparini: His imagination has no limits. His fantasy and it's always the fantasy of theirs. And you said that you will beat him 6-0. You promised. And if you don't do 6-0, you're going to quit arm wrestling. If you don't beat him, you're going to quit arm wrestling.
Ermes Gasparini: I just caught at the top of the chat, like it cannot go any further, but the very far away, there's the message he's saying in Russian. When I rip off Levan's hand, then Levan will, he doesn't say Levan, but I assume it's about Levan. He says, Levan also knows Russian. That's why I read Russian. It means when I rip off Levan's arm, Levan will start singing differently.
Ermes Gasparini: So if he really speaks about Levan, then that's what he meant. So he is saying the same name, but Ades assumed it's Levan.
Ermes Gasparini: He's saying that no matter how hard Paisulaev would lose against Levan, they would still come up for any reason, like excuse to say, ah, Paisulaev at some point was really close to him. So no matter how bad he will defeat Paisulaev, it's no difference. OK. I understand.
Ermes Gasparini: Okay, let's talk about the last match, John Burzyk versus Irakli Zirakashvili. Irakli. Yeah, of course. David you say that John better stay in USA and not come here? Or something like that, did you say? Golden boy Zirakashvili. Good Khariro.
Ermes Gasparini: golden boy is winning he said that iraq is gonna beat john and take all jones retirement pension money to home oh you are saying you are john better stay in uh usa that's what basically he said oh this this is you know john john
Ermes Gasparini: doesn't like this kind of provocation if you talk like this john is gonna come i i i don't think if i made to say but i would still say i think john actually started to tease the uh uh iraqi side of the uh arm wrestling world because he said
Ermes Gasparini: john is the most experienced he has ever been which obviously is the truth i love gold but he also said that's only that's gonna be very like enough to beat iraqi so i think he started to tease him um
Ermes Gasparini: One thing Lewand just finds very not pleasant is that John is constantly talking about Dennis, about Dennis match. And he doesn't want Irakli to beat him so bad after such an underestimation. So that's why.
Ermes Gasparini: okay so basically he says maybe john should take iraqi more seriously i guess that's what he meant okay now now i think i think i think zaur is in the chat hello
Ermes Gasparini: So in chat, could you tell us if it was you or not? Yes, it was me. I asked him and actually he said it was him in the chat. Yeah, yeah. That's why I sent him the link. I sent him the link, yeah. Okay, let's go.
Ermes Gasparini: What did he say? He said that he was just spectating how we were judging about this later discussion, and then he just wanted to join. Yes, yes, yes. Can you tell him? Can you tell him? He asks why he cannot see all of us at the same time.
Zaur Payzulaev: You can see it there. Ah, it switches, right? You can see it there, thank you. I also flew here to have fun.
Ermes Gasparini: they are talking to each other just in russian like leon asked about the place where he was joining us in life he's in the car and which car he was okay okay yeah can you ask zaur zaur told me that hermes is only 130 kilo and he's not even he is not even super heavyweight
Ermes Gasparini: So, and was he joking or serious? Zaur, you told Engin that Hermes at that moment is not a super heavyweight, super heavyweight. Were you joking or were you serious? I'm serious. Whoever is up to 150 kg is not a heavyweight at all.
Zaur Payzulaev: So he was serious. He's saying that Hermes is really heavyweight, but not that super heavyweight. So he said Hermes is heavyweight. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Levan Saginashvili: He's saying that naturally, Hermes is not super heavyweight. Basically, that's what he said. Yes, yes. But what did he mean by saying that? He said that Hermes cannot be an opponent for him?
Ermes Gasparini: He's really pushing it. He's saying that against super heavyweights like himself, like Levan, for example, he doesn't have a chance. Oh, Hermes should play in lower categories, not in this league. Yeah, not for super heavyweights. He suggests us to...
Ermes Gasparini: tell him now these words when he will come out of russia his dream his beautiful dream will stop immediately when it will come out of the russia which dream is stopping immediately
Ermes Gasparini: Do you understand, Roman? Yes, yes, yes. Ermes, I wanted to tell you that when you come to the world, not here in Russia, your dream will come true and it will be very unlikely for you.
Ermes Gasparini: when you go from Russia to armwrestling. I don't get it, I don't get it. Your balls will get stuck when you go from Russia to fight other armwrestlers. Damn, I don't get it at all.
Ermes Gasparini: He cannot hear clearly what I'm saying. Maybe because my Russian is not very good. Levan is in the chat. I think Levan is not in the chat at the moment. No, Levan is here. Okay.
Ermes Gasparini: Levan, can you explain to Zaur that Hermes said that, okay, first Zaur said that Hermes is too light. He's heavyweight, but not super heavyweight. And he said, Hermes should play in lighter categories. He is not an opponent for you or for Zaur. This is what Zaur said. And Hermes said, when Zaur leaves, finally, Russia, and then comes to the real world, and Hermes said,
Ermes Gasparini: zaor's beautiful dream will finish can you can you can you tell this to zaor
Ermes Gasparini: Okay, okay. We need another translator, my friend. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no.
Ermes Gasparini: I don't think it's a big deal for me. I don't think it's a big deal for me, because I'm not the only one who thinks it's a big deal. I think it's a big deal. I think there are many reasons why I think that people are afraid of these kinds of things. I don't think it's a big deal. I think it's a big deal.
Ermes Gasparini: I don't know what to say.
Ermes Gasparini: uh so leon actually answered what zao said in georgian so i would just briefly said it and then i would i would translate also to zao uh leon said that uh aramis is completely capable of beating super heavyweights and then he also said they uh when he was 95 kg he beat sea life so he cannot judge him like he's not ready for super heavyweights or something like this
Ermes Gasparini: Hermes is definitely enough for any super heavyweight in the world. Zau, Hermes told you that when you leave Russia, your dream will come true. That's what I wanted to tell you. Let him come to Russia, his dream will come true. He'll be in Italy.
Ermes Gasparini: uh ermis ermis now he answers to you why don't you go to russia and then your dreams will finish i can't they want to come and destroy everybody i want to come but i can't my friend
Ermes Gasparini: He wants to do armwrestling with the guys in Russia, but he can't. I don't know why. I think... The second place in the league is the best in the world. I think it's already developing. $16,000, please come and take my money.
Zaur Payzulaev: Four times a year. We don't have any prohibitions for anyone. Anyone can come. Anyone.
Ermes Gasparini: So he's saying... Roman, Roman, Roman, let Vassily, Vassily is here. Oh, Vassily is here? Okay, Vassily is better, yeah. So shortly he's saying that everyone is more than welcome to come and try their power and prove their worth in Chechnya, plus you're going to leave it with like some money, like for first place there is $6,000 for absolute, there is $10,000, so come on.
Ermes Gasparini: Everyone is more than welcome. And Zaur, how about you and Hermes? If I would just say, offer you a super match against Hermes, would you accept? Can you beat this guy? Levan, if Engin offers you a match with Hermes, will you accept it? And do you think you will win against Hermes?
Zaur Payzulaev: Is this some kind of joke? Does he really think he can win? He was fighting with the Czechs. Tell him he was fighting with the Czechs and somehow, I don't know, he killed himself. He killed himself, I don't know, he almost died. And he thinks he can do something? And he's only 20 grams, tell me.
Ermes Gasparini: does uh uh without any disrespect to rms like but uh as i was saying like that's rms is really things that he can conquer and show something against with zaor he barely won the dave chaffee he gave all his power on the match with dave chaffee yes and he thinks that he can show something against zaor come on they talk about water my friend
Ermes Gasparini: He beat only C-Live. He beat nobody, my friend. He lost the World Championship with the Bulgarian guy seven months ago. Very easy, like butter. No like butter. Yeah? The Bulgarian guy. What's the name? What? Bulgarian guy. He won.
Ermes Gasparini: Gheorghe, Gheorghe is Swedish. Gheorghe, he usually with Gheorghe easy like this. With a batter wrist. Like a batter wrist. And he never try with Cefi, he never try with Genadi, he never try with Morozov, he never try with nobody. Why he talk about war? I don't understand why he talk with us. I don't understand.
Ermes Gasparini: So you are saying that he has no business in this level? You think that he has no business in this level? The first thing is better to try himself with Vendetta, with six or five rounds. And if you beat someone, very good guy, top five like this,
Ermes Gasparini: yeah he came to start to talk something so you are thinking right now right now you think he is not in your level my friend i beat i stopped with him in the in the center and they i i speak with him oh you would you would stop him in the center if you talk with him yeah
Ermes Gasparini: Okay, Vasily, go ahead. Yeah. He thinks that... Well, in general, he's outraged. Why do you say that? Because you didn't fight with any of the tops of today. Silaev, well, he doesn't consider Silaev top 3, let's say, top 5. He said that he will just stop you in the center and will keep talking to you.
Ermes Gasparini: The reality is very soon, my friend.
Ermes Gasparini: He said that we'll see in the end of February how he's going to keep his wrist.
Ermes Gasparini: He says that probably Lewand is going to make a progression like this. Yes. No, no, no. He's actually right now saying about himself and his possible match with Hermes. So Hermes wouldn't be able to even hold him and keep him even for a second. That Zaur will win 6-0 easily.
Ermes Gasparini: No, without any disrespect, he's a powerful guy. But let's talk about the weight. 155 kg against his plan to gain up on 185 kg. Come on.
Ermes Gasparini: and and and before that leon also said that these two guys like hermes and zao are so at each other right now they are uh sharing these words right and maybe we should cancel uh hermes versus leo and put hermes versus our match no no no no no no not my level my friend is better wait wait
Ermes Gasparini: Okay, so Hermes is saying that Zaur is not in Hermes' level, and it is Lewan who is at Hermes' level, so we need to see the number one. Is this what you say, Hermes? Okay, yeah, translate that, Vasili, please.
Ermes Gasparini: No, I don't say that. It's Hermes who says that. Vasily, I don't say that. It's what Hermes says.
Ermes Gasparini: uh it's still not uh he's asking you're gonna come you're gonna compete against each other in february it's confirmed or no about ermes and levan
Ermes Gasparini: Not signed yet. But we expect. My friend is for the number two. You are the number one. You are already number one. You are already number one. This match is for number two.
Ermes Gasparini: Levan also said that right now, in his time, it's really late. Right now, he needs to go. Yes, yes. I want to ask one question, Levan.
Zaur Payzulaev: They can speak in Russian, actually, Vasyl. No, no, we want to hear as well. Yeah. They speak in Russian as well. Ask Levon. Levon, I want to ask you about... I'm just curious. I did 75 for 9 times, pronator, behind the table. Well, like pronator, bog, it was all together. I'm just curious how much he will do.
Zaur Payzulaev: I don't know how many they do. I haven't even seen this video. They only download beats. I haven't even seen them on the Pronator. How many have you downloaded? 75. In short, for a table, on a block, clean weight, 75 for 9 times, well, through Pronator.
Zaur Payzulaev: Any translation?
Ermes Gasparini: He's challenging Levan to show the video of how Levan will perform one exercise for the pronator on the table. If Levan will do at least two reps with the same weight as Zaur is doing, he would be surprised. Yeah, but armwrestling is not all about that, you know.
Ermes Gasparini: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Ermes Gasparini: It's not clear, but everyone has their own strong, how can I say, coals. But you haven't tried? You haven't tried? With the table? I do, but I don't do such a big weight. I pump about 30-35 kilograms. I saw in Dubai, they wrote that you are 88.5, but there is a lie. There is 68.5 or 70, that's the maximum.
Ermes Gasparini: Any translation? And I will ask one question, Levon, then you can go. The first translated Vasily, what do they say?
Ermes Gasparini: Okay, so they're saying about the video of Levan performing one of the exercises in Dubai as well, that it seems a bit fake one, that they messed up with the weight and Levan raised a bit smaller weight, like they show. No, it was...
Ermes Gasparini: 48 it's on it was 45 kg settled and plus added uh four four plates by 10 kg okay i always think that it's uh one plate it's 10 pounds not 10 kg listen listen i will ask one question
Ermes Gasparini: Ermes, can I ask you a question? Zaur, forget about lifting. We arm ourselves right now, right now. Arm lately, like this, my friend. No, no way. Listen, listen, listen. Ermes, I'm trying to ask you a question. Zaur, can you ask Zaur if Zaur is ready for Levan or he needs a little bit more time? Zaur, are you ready for Levan or do you need more time to prepare?
Ermes Gasparini: He needs at least six months because he's planning to get 190 kg. So he says that right now Zaur sees himself as number two
Ermes Gasparini: But he believes there is a possibility to become number one, but not now, a little bit later. Correct? Zaur, do you see yourself in second place now, as he understands, or will you be able to claim first place in the near future? I don't know. I don't know if I'm in second place. He's 125 kg. Let him try to beat me.
Zaur Payzulaev: If not, they weren't in second place as for now.
Ermes Gasparini: So he's saying actually the 100 kg wild horse Matt Musk beat Hermes. Then the first truly heavyweight guy, Kurdesha, beat Hermes easily. So who is on the second place if not Zaur?
Ermes Gasparini: But we know, we know, everybody knows Zaur is number one. He's the real number one. I want to watch Zaur versus Hermes. Listen, listen, Lewan. You said you want Hermes versus Zaur, but we don't know who is number one now. Maybe Hermes is going to destroy you. Zaur is number one. Believe me. Believe me. Super strong.
Ermes Gasparini: first of all you versus Hermes let's see how is it gonna be because I really do not know this guy is strong I think I think both Zaur and Hermes make a mistake they underestimate each other both of these guys are very good and I think these are good opponents for you to play one and if you
Ermes Gasparini: I think that, first of all, you need to face with Hermes. If you beat Hermes, then maybe they can pull, and then we can see if Zaur .
Ermes Gasparini: he's saying that he's gonna set that match up like he's he's now he's his uh target is like he's gonna beat ermis because then he will be able to face zaur and beat him there so that's that's the target now first ermis and then yeah yeah
Ermes Gasparini: Ermest or Zaur, more tougher opponent? Ermest. Right now, as we speak, Ermest is tougher opponent.
Ermes Gasparini: It's not possible. If one or two of them come out, I won't be able to go to Russia with them. It's not like I'll be able to go to the tournament. It would be interesting to see how they will come out in the next round.
Ermes Gasparini: He's saying that right now, as we speak, Hermes is a tougher opponent. Hermes' level is already proven. We already know how tough Hermes is and where Hermes stands.
Ermes Gasparini: But considering how good Zhao is, we cannot determine because he's just only pulled the guys who is also hard to be determined against the rest of the world. So he says that in order to know really how tough Zhao could be, is to just like make a test matches or like Zhao to test himself against very elite good pullers in outside of Russia. That's the best way to know how good Zhao is.
Ermes Gasparini: Vasily, you can also tell Zaur and Levan, my friend. Zaur, Levan said that, well, Engin asked Levan who would be a more difficult opponent for him, Hermes or you. Levan said that it is difficult to judge completely, but technically Hermes, simply because he had already fought with world tops and showed what he was capable of.
Ermes Gasparini: And we haven't seen you in fights with people not from the Russian Federation. Especially in warm fights. Therefore, you must first try yourself, show yourself to others. With someone in your fight, in the top 5, let's say. And there you can already judge how hard you could be for him. Got it, got it. So, Ernest will be the first.
Ermes Gasparini: Okay. So, Ermes is going to be the first one who's going to check how truly is Zaur's power. Ermes, you heard, right? Check, check, check something. Ermes, I have a question for you. If you beat Levan,
Ermes Gasparini: Or if you lose Levan, in any case, you're going to meet this guy. David it make it? I want to stop this crazy man. I want to stop this crazy man. You are saying that you win? It's a fantasy, a big fantasy. So, Hermes, you are saying that you will pull Levan and you are saying that you believe in yourself you're going to win. But do you win or you lose?
Ermes Gasparini: you're going to face this guy and he made it personal. In any case, you're going to pull this guy, correct? Yeah, yeah. After Levan, we can decide. After Levan. You win against Levan or you lose. You're going to pull this guy. Yeah, if I don't have a pain or something, yes, no problem. Yes, yes. And Vasily, can you explain that? Yeah. Zaur.
Ermes Gasparini: Nginz asked Hermes, despite the possibility of his fight with Levan, will he lose or win, will he fight with you? Hermes said yes, of course, because he wants to stop this big man, his dreams, all his flights in dreams, in short. It was great, great.
Zaur Payzulaev: After the match, cry, very cry. Actually, no, actually Zaur said then RMS will wake up and cry as well.
Ermes Gasparini: Now honestly saying he actually his way of behavior and he joins the chess just for fun to make some fun honestly saying uh victory comes only from God that's it like you can win lose victory comes only from God so if you deserve to win
Ermes Gasparini: Yes, with the gut power, you will win. And Zaur is saying that if the match will be settled, he's going to be prepared for 100%. Okay, another question. Vasily, can you ask Zaur, what is the percentage he gives Hermes? What is the percentage he gives Levan? Zaur, in your opinion, what are the chances for Hermes and Levan in terms of percentage? Between themselves.
Zaur Payzulaev: He's saying actually 90% on Levan and 10% Hermes. And 10% only in case Levan's hand will get cramp. Cramp, yes.
Ermes Gasparini: And Vasily, what is Zaur's chance against Hermes? What's your chance against Hermes? 90%. 90%? Well, I hope it's 90% too. Same scenario, same. What? Same scenario. Same, just like 92%. Only 90%, my friend. Two deaths. 90% will be left, it will still be like that.
Ermes Gasparini: He gives only 10% on the way if Zaur Hand will get some cramp, you know. And Hermes, what's your chance against Zaur? Zero. Number one, my friend. Sure, I beat everybody easy. Zero chance. Vasily, tell Zaur that Hermes is making fun with him. He says that Hermes has zero chance against Zaur.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, he knows that you're joking as well and Ermes is joking as well. That's why he wanted to join us and also make some fun, you know.
Ermes Gasparini: Okay, okay. One last thing I will tell to Levan and let Levan go. Levan, what you need to do, my friend, first beat, or not beat, first pull, pull Hermes. If you beat Hermes, then second pull with Jerry. And if you beat Jerry this year, also pull Zaur. I think this is your three, my opinion, this year, your three matches, my opinion.
Ermes Gasparini: uh yeah he understood i have a question for you lewan ernest jerry zaur can you make 18 zero
Ermes Gasparini: It will be extremely hard. But it's definitely doable. No, no, no. Not in same event. In this year, different times. Yes, yes.
Ermes Gasparini: Such a high level vendetta, such a high level arm fights, like three of those in one year, it would be really challenging and really tough to do. But he said that it's manageable and he will do it. And Ermes, you always tell everyone that you're going to finish their beautiful dream. Are you going to finish this Levan's beautiful dream?
Ermes Gasparini: No, please. Together. I am at your corner. Yeah, my friend. No, please. I know my dreams. No. He said, no, my friend, don't do it, Hermes, no. Listen, listen, listen. Listen, Levan, Levan. To coach Hermes, he gives me 20%.
Ermes Gasparini: If you give me 25%, we can talk about it. Very good businessman, huh? Yeah. Organizing. He really needs to go, guys. He's just saying goodbye to everybody.
Ermes Gasparini: it's a huge pleasure to talk with you guys everybody and he wishes you a new year happy new year and he just needs to leave right now yeah thank you take care thank you very much for joining take care guys take care yeah and then the one left so a little bit more talk here a little bit more zaur what are you gonna do
Ermes Gasparini: If Hermes beats Levan, will you change your mind about Hermes? You say he's only heavyweight, not super heavyweight. What if he beats Levan? Then your opinion is going to change? You will respect Hermes more? Will your thoughts change if Hermes wins against Levan? Will your opinion change that Hermes is not a real super heavyweight?
Zaur Payzulaev: Well, I would be very surprised, very surprised. It's hard to believe it, because you don't see what he can win for. I can analyze. I don't see what he can win for. He's used to defending, right? And here, as it were, I don't know, I don't see it.
Ermes Gasparini: he will be really surprised because on his opinion he actually doesn't know how hermes could go through the level because hermes used to defend and here you need to like attack so only maybe in case if le one will suddenly or somehow will lose around 30 kg yeah hermes will have a chance
Ermes Gasparini: But tell him if he can win with Georgi. Why Georgi? Six months ago. One year ago. Eight months ago. One year. He lost very easily with Georgi. Why?
Zaur Payzulaev: Why did you lose to Tsvetkov so easily? I'll tell you. First of all, it was my first tournament abroad. And two weeks before I left, I injured my side leg. For example, my left leg is weaker by 1.5-2 times than the weak one. If you look to the left, no one even took it, just lost by fouls.
Zaur Payzulaev: Although it was almost twice as weak. And the right one, the right one, I just couldn't press the side ligament. That's it. It just inflamed and hurt. And when it was warming up, I was traumatized. It was warming up for a long time and I got hurt. The side ligament just didn't work for me.
Ermes Gasparini: actually two it was first of all it was his first competition abroad and two weeks before the competition uh he got injured a bit his ligament so he couldn't use side pressure anyhow plus he also a bit messed up with warming up before the competition so he totally damaged his ligament on the right hand that's why he actually couldn't use his side pressure as well
Zaur Payzulaev: He lost the wrist, not the pressure. He says you lost the wrist, not the pressure. You lost the wrist. No, my wrist was as high as possible, and I couldn't put pressure on the wrist. I won the wrist, but I couldn't put pressure on it.
Ermes Gasparini: Actually, he's saying that the strap was put so high so he couldn't feel his wrist as well and he couldn't move, he couldn't do the side pressure. He could win if he would fresh.
Ermes Gasparini: so it's actually he's saying that it's uh funny to consider his uh one lost like for like for past two years or something like this because how many times like before
Zaur Payzulaev: Actually, almost two years ago. It was in the beginning of 2021.
Ermes Gasparini: He's saying so. It was 2021 WAF World Championships. End of it. It was about like end of October, beginning of November 2021. WAF is always end of the year. It's not a problem. But what if Jerry beats Georgi and then Georgi beat you? And do you think that Jerry should be also considered one of the top or no?
Zaur Payzulaev: Zaur, if Jerry wins with Georgi, and Georgi wins with you, will you consider Jerry number one? I'll explain. First of all, Georgi is as uncomfortable as possible with Jerry. Because he has a good lutz, a good pronator, but the side ligament doesn't work, he doesn't have the pressure.
Zaur Payzulaev: Jerry Cadareto, although he is weaker, but due to the inconvenience of the technique, he will most likely win Tsvetkov. But if I put money between Tsvetkov and Gasparini, then I would put it on Tsvetkov, because I am sure that Tsvetkov will win Gasparini, because he has a stronger and better planter.
Ermes Gasparini: oh so actually first part of the question is that he thinks that jerry's really uncomfortable opening for a georgie because his way of technique it's really uncomfortable he thinks that he's less powerful but still he thinks that jerry gonna win sweat gold because he's really uncomfortable for him as well and also he said if he would he need
Ermes Gasparini: if he would bet some money on a match hermes versus georgie tvetko he would put money on swedkov because he think he's a powerful one than hermes in some moments as well yeah
Ermes Gasparini: zaur um i have i have known hermes for many years i never seen him this angry he is really angry with you and he will come he will come to you know really really serious preparation for you can you translate the varsity yeah sure uh
Zaur Payzulaev: And judging by this, he can say that Hermes will come after you and will be prepared. Yes, ready for all 100. He has already done the maximum that he could. He has already gained 130 kg. I did not think that he would gain more there, because he is a middleweight. This is his ceiling.
Ermes Gasparini: honestly honestly saying he says that hermes already reached his weight limit uh genetical weight limit yeah because he's not naturally super heavy waiter so he doesn't know what he can do else to be able to win him you are not afraid that zaul you go like this and then enemies top rolls your wrist no possible
Ermes Gasparini: remember my friend remember one things i refer them in the two years ago be easy georgie you remember last year yeah and georgie beat easy this is enough it's a good argument that's a good argument
Ermes Gasparini: now i'm more stronger than when i fought with the reef and this is enough okay did you did you guys daniel i'm not a troublemaker maybe he understands something okay
Zaur Payzulaev: What is there to talk about? If Arif won against Tsvetkov two years ago, and Tsvetkov won against you, what is there to talk about? It's clear. Look, it works like this. If Ivan lost to Konstantinov, and Konstantinov lost to Erles, then Erles is stronger.
Ermes Gasparini: So they say like he thinks that it doesn't work like this. Like, let's say like Levan before he lost to Konstantinov and Hermes. So what do you speak about? Ten years ago he lost with Konstantinov.
Ermes Gasparini: We talk about the two years ago. No, one year ago. Vasily Zaur knows that one year later Lewand beat Costadino in Zloty Tur. He knows that, right? Last time they met, Lewand beat Krasimir. No, but I think Roman, he is also saying that one year later, everything can change.
Ermes Gasparini: it's it's true as well yeah yeah so so okay there is only one way to find out this only one way and are you ready to pull this guy no matter if you beat levan or if you lose levan doesn't matter are you ready to pull this guy
Ermes Gasparini: And does he have any, let me do more trouble maker, does he have any score prediction?
Zaur Payzulaev: What do you think, how will your match turn out? I think I'll have to listen to him. If I listen to him, he'll be like this. He'll be talking to me, he'll probably be like this, as I understand it. With his words. He'll be telling me jokes. That's how the meeting will go.
Ermes Gasparini: He's saying that if we're going to listen to Hermes, it probably seems that the match will be like Hermes will just hold the hand of Zohr and we'll tell him some jokes on the table, you know? Say again, say again. He's saying that if we listen to Hermes, how the match will go, so probably it will be like Hermes will just hold Zohr's hand and we'll tell him some jokes on the table, you know what I mean?
Zaur Payzulaev: But what's Zaur's prediction? What's Zaur's prediction? What's Zaur's prediction? What's Zaur's prediction? What's Zaur's prediction? What's Zaur's prediction? What's Zaur's prediction?
Zaur Payzulaev: I know that he has a strong side there, that he defends everything. But I'll just break through the center, I'll just break through the center and bring it to the pillow. With a broken center, he won't stop. That's what I think. I think so, but how it will be, only Allah knows.
Ermes Gasparini: He actually doesn't know the score. I cannot say exactly the score, but he's sure that he's going to break the Hermes center. And after this, it's going to be hard to Hermes. No matter how good he is in the defend position, it's going to be hard to him. So Zaur will pin him after breaking the Hermes center. Okay, so he says that basically he's going to beat Hermes, and Hermes says he's going to beat Zaur. Okay, so not fashionable.
Ermes Gasparini: I want to try, but maybe he can do something. But Hermes, did you not say that you were going to hold him in the center and talk with him? I'm joking, my friend. Which one is joking? Now or before? Yeah, joking before. So you are not brave enough to face him? Okay, I understand. No, no, I'm brave, I'm brave. I want to try and we'll see if I can do something.
Ermes Gasparini: okay okay if they can't resist the one second maybe he's joking tell us how you really feel inside of you you are saying i'm gonna go and then just crush you inside already come on your nose is growing yeah okay yeah let's now i'm serious
Ermes Gasparini: Who is the strongest will win. Yes, it's beautiful to speak like this, but the results are on the table. Yes, but right now you need to focus only on Levan. Only Levan. This is your dream match, the most important match. You really need to focus there. We should not blur.
Ermes Gasparini: And Zaur, one last question. What is your top five in the world? Levan is number two.
Ermes Gasparini: okay so it says that zaur is number one lebanon is number two he says
Ermes Gasparini: On third place, he will put Denis Cyplenkov, but only six months after, from today, you know? Six months later.
Ermes Gasparini: So he says that number one is Zaur, number two is Levan, number three is Denis, and then who are number four, number five? Who else in the top five? I'll think about it. Chilaev. Hermes on the fourth and Chethi on the fifth.
Ermes Gasparini: Hermes number four, Dave Cefi is number five. Yeah. Okay, so we understand everything and then we found out soon and then now let's focus the whole world to focus on Hermes Gasparini versus Levan Saginashvili. I hope this match is set and then we soon hear. I can't wait because that is Hermes' dream match.
Ermes Gasparini: And then let's see if number one is going to change in the world or not. Okay, guys. Zaur, do you want to say any last words before we close? Zaur, do you have anything to say before we finish? Do you have any last words? I will love... I just want...
Zaur Payzulaev: I want to be happy if he wins at least one or two rounds. I'll be rooting for him. I want him to do something.
Ermes Gasparini: so honestly saying that he would on upcoming match between rms and uh
Ermes Gasparini: Yes, Levan, yeah. He was cheering for Hermes. He was cheering for Hermes to let him use his, not only his words, yeah, besides the table, but use his level of defense and concur something, to show something against Levan. So no matter of what, how the match will go, he will support and cheering for Hermes to let him show something against Levan. He really wants it.
Ermes Gasparini: Thank you for your support. At least if Hermes is going to take one or two rounds, he's going to post Hermes on his page. Thank you. Thank you a lot.
Ermes Gasparini: yeah but unless one round two rounds is not enough right no not enough minimum four rounds and then i i go your corner you give me 25 percent not 20. wait wait it's in that it's 20 and you said it's 20. i mean maybe maybe i get better offer from levan for the coaching you know you and i we go dubai
Ermes Gasparini: And then we go coach trainers for Hermes. Okay? For support. For support.
Ermes Gasparini: uh he said that if someone will provide the ticket cost ticket expenses and uh this one uh house allowance he will go okay the last question i'm finishing um you're gonna pull
Ermes Gasparini: Hermes no matter what the result Hermes and Levan even Hermes wins Hermes loses it doesn't matter you're gonna pull Hermes the next match correct uh
Zaur Payzulaev: If he gets injured, for example, then he won't be able to fight anymore. I'm ready. But if there is an injury, someone will break his arm or he will break it. Only this can stop him.
Ermes Gasparini: he thinks that he is ready mentally he's ready and he's he would like to but for sure everything might happen uh if rms will get injured or something like this and it won't be possible to organize this match you know yeah yeah and every year next year if there are some injuries like this we can organize sure maybe you explain to wendy
Ermes Gasparini: yeah yeah if there are some problems but uh one month later or i don't know yeah let's see let's let's talk about it they have a tournament in april in chechnya yes beginning of april
