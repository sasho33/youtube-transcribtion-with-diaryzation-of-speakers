Paul Linn: three two one got it let me see if i can get on here and read some some comments on my other phone i probably can't oh yeah yeah and that way that's where you'll check make sure i'm alive as well yeah let me get on here
Artem Taranov: all right all right seems like perfect perfect seems like we are alive all right everybody welcome to our actually on this channel it's a second episode on the podcast first episode was done by engin and john zhang but here we are me and paul lin gonna talk about what's up paul
Artem Taranov: what's going on hey so today we're going to talk about uh matches for east versus west six we're going to talk about everything we have on the list and if you don't know something we're going to play it off in some way because i was thinking actually me and paul both are going to be there so maybe i don't know we're just going to go with some blind assumption just so who's going to be right and the loser going to end up buying drinks on sunday okay i'm good with that i'm good with that
Artem Taranov: that's too bad like everything there is good right uh if there was some type of like mega painful experience downstairs in that spa like where you get you like some type of weird wax down in your ears maybe we could do something like that like all right sunday loser go
Paul Linn: yeah dude i got i got we i we got a massage oh y'all went there okay yeah we went and got a massage it was very very interesting i'm not gonna get into that on here though okay
Artem Taranov: well so we can come up with a torture so all right um so we're gonna go for i have this card and i'll pull up for the people just for a second and and so you can get familiar with it too so this is for everybody and for a poll to get familiar with and i'm looking i'll be looking at it the whole thing but we have 16 matches
Artem Taranov: with either i don't know if this is the order this is just like it was depressing the first official list that i grabbed and i think that's i mean jerry and georgie is the title match so it looks like it could be the potential order yeah
Artem Taranov: we all see we see we see a poll work his way from like match number four from the bottom to nash number five from the top baby that's because of the root song that ain't because of me no no no no no you're gonna get some what all right so
Artem Taranov: everybody gets familiar with the matches we got 29 30 people in the chat so that's cool all right so match number 16 paul is epic comic and i'd back beckett so i don't know if you're familiar with i mean i know you're probably familiar with
Artem Taranov: f a little bit yeah i had to do some youtubing right back and he uh he's from kyrgyzstan he has impressive uh showing left-handed at worlds it doesn't say here but i'm assuming the match is left-handed now that i'm thinking but usually they do point it out isn't isn't f8 left right on par with his right
Artem Taranov: that's that's what i'm not quite sure is and the match does not specify that is left-handed but the videos that you see if i back on youtube are left-handed so uh but just so just uh going by those levels they're both competitive right they both compete out there world said that what heavy super heavyweight class i'm not quite sure in fa uh
Paul Linn: What's your familiarity with your, are we just betting against each other? Oh yeah. This is, this one's a little bit of a stab in the dark. I'm familiar with that thing. You know, um, it's hard, like, you know, if I don't know much about a guy and he's from Kazakhstan, I already respect his level. I got you.
Paul Linn: So there's part of me that's like, all right, you know, just based off of that alone, you almost want to give them the favorite. But being that I know F.A., I mean, I guess if we don't know what's a right or left arm match, I think that makes it really tough to predict. But, I mean, if we're picking somebody right now, I would go with F.A. just because he's known quantity.
Artem Taranov: Engin's yelling that we hacked his channel. Exactly what he's saying. Engin's saying we hacked his channel. It's all good, Engin. They're promoting the card. Yeah. Okay, so are you Team Effenden or Team iAdvent?
Artem Taranov: Yeah, I think I think then I'm going back. And so far, we don't know. But basically, at this point, we're going to bet Turkish beer as soon as we're going to see who is paying who. So so far, that this is so this is one we're going to see number 16. We've tried to document this at, you know, how many beers I end up with. The main Turkish beer is actually FAA, isn't it? Yes, I think it's something like that. Yeah, well, again,
Artem Taranov: I bet an FAA on an FAA. Okay, Engin is in the chat to make sure we behave and we know proper names, so he will correct us. Okay, good. So, Engin, tell us, by the way, if it's left-handed. Ertem, can you ask... Ertem, can you ask Paul if he will sign a T-shirt for me? Absolutely. I'm not sure why you want me to, but...
Artem Taranov: Oh man, I feel like I'm in trouble. Okay. Number 15, Robert Baxter and Ahmet Yenerer. So I don't know anything about Ahmet. I mean, I know Robert Baxter and I know Robert's been competing at the world level. Tell us about Robert.
Paul Linn: He's been competing at the world level at the Masters category forever now. He represents Team USA all the time. Well, you can only do it after 40, so he can't do it forever now. Well, how old is he now? He's been doing it for a while. I didn't know. You were telling me about it. Mid-50s. Mid-50s, I believe. Okay.
Paul Linn: And I know, you know, he's just went and got into the whole stem cell thing like everybody else. And as Scott and Mason will tell you, it must be the fountain of youth. So I got to support Robert for sure, especially against an unknown quantity. Okay, interesting. So because we don't know anything about Ahmet and I have to give him support, I'm going to have another beer with Ahmet here. Okay. What are you drinking, by the way?
Artem Taranov: ginger ale okay ginger ale yeah all right sore throat don't judge me okay i love it i love it i'm gonna do the real thing uh all right if you get get interesting here we have match number 14 raymond lippens and that girl coach
Paul Linn: This one is really, really interesting, right? Me and Coach Ray have an agreement that we support each other no matter what. Okay. We, you know, and honestly. It makes it a little awkward knowing what I know. Yeah, yeah. Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you, if you look at it based off a body of work, there is no way to not have Ray as the favorite.
Paul Linn: He went 16-0. His level is improving, I think, clearly. You pulled him, so you know firsthand. Doug has been off since the last WAL season. And he's been training. Doug pulled at a high level for quite some time.
Paul Linn: i got it doug and i've been talking quite a bit i'm gonna go train with doug uh in the coming weeks as well as yourself um so i'm gonna go ahead and go out on a limb and i'm gonna put my fa on doug really okay yes yes yes yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna support i'm gonna support doug uh with the understanding that ray is clearly the favorite
Artem Taranov: interesting okay um so i thought about this match too uh i've talked to coach ray i'm not gonna tell you what coach ray told me about his strategy for dog because that's i can't say that out loud because they're the police might come to the door they're like no you cannot say that so i can't say now but um
Artem Taranov: so knowing as you said like so history of dog for the past couple of years he been competing in the high level but each time he did so was uh a success and not success right he always been at at par versus anyone i think he went against but it always end up on an injury or you know something rather than so there is a you have to take that as a factor and
Artem Taranov: considering how active coach ray have been and though i think the weight difference there a little bit i know doug started arm wrestling it heavier and working his healthy weight down and but i mean i guess i guess the weight is kind of there i think coach could be a little bit heavier but how much is ray right now i think ray's light isn't he
Artem Taranov: yeah i think right now is all the fasting he got going on i think he's fairly in that like uh under 90 kilos i'm saying like yeah i believe like the frame i i think i'm more that's what more i'm referring to i think coach the bigger guy and
Artem Taranov: it is the activity i have to say that uh i mean coach ray has to come there with bringing it to three zero you know i mean that's the goal yeah uh can you uh is it possible or not you're gonna see by practicing his dog in a couple of weeks and i mean if he's there power wise that hey he's there right then i mean i think is it possible
Artem Taranov: Yes, if a dog has not been completely on the couch and he understands levels, I think he can be there, right? But if he's been couch potato for most of this time, it's going to be a rough comeback. Right.
Paul Linn: yeah yeah i mean i i like what you're saying i think i think the weight because doug was normally a bigger guy but i think he's only walking around at like 185 right now right so i'm not sure like how much of a weight cut there's going to be uh i know ray you know like you said with the fasting um i think ray's about 200 normally
Paul Linn: yeah but what i mean when i talked to him last east versus west he was wanting to go down down like way down and he had started the fasting around that time so i don't know how that plays in but i do think frame wise raised a little bit bigger but but doug has the height i think doug's stature wise is a little bit bigger i don't know again there's a whole lot of unknown variables
Paul Linn: You know, the whole idea of being super active and what does that do to you? It means like you're not going to be rusty, but are you injured? Are you 100%? You know, is there wear and tear? Are you ready to peak because of your activity prior? Where now you have Doug who's had a two-year hiatus, there should be no injuries, you know, everything should be working, you know, at a high level. Does that benefit him or does that create, you know, table rust?
Paul Linn: so there's a lot of variables i think the table time is depending there too did you have stable time during all that time was he training at all like what was happening there right i would love to see this match just go into like a deep book and stop and be like great and epic one way or the other that's what i would like to see don't know if we're gonna see it but that would be cool
Artem Taranov: right so okay well we really had our disagreements here so uh so you're going with doug i'm uh with my money i'm going to be scott ray unless a dog otherwise in a couple of weeks here right because i love money all right we have not much number 13 mean douglas and nur dalet
Artem Taranov: okay so so give me the rundown on orderly okay so you do a good research on this one i'm not going first on this one i did my i did my personal video today so it's like the probably the only match i'm like fully like aware about which i did not so
Artem Taranov: it seems like as far as the rankings and the competition goes nordolet could be the favorite here because he like at the recent worlds where they all competed at i think in the august took like six i believe and nordolet was the winner over prokopchuk right so and in the recent years so nordolet basically came to our wrestling from like uh 60 kilos so what 143 and then
Artem Taranov: like i think not year by year but i think he slowly went to 65 one world to 65 then went to 70 kilos and i think won 70 and then 75. so he's been coming up in recent years and so he's been actively competing at worlds kind of every year and doing pretty good and jumping you know five kilo classes and you know so he he's up there with pro cop trick where he beats him and uh i think mean dog is
Artem Taranov: i don't know if my dog is beats prokopchuk i know he is up there where he takes his hand and they always in the war but i don't know who's doing their food but as far as like from what i've seen i believe mindagas has like somebody to beat here and you know so like like meaning he's an underdog here and so yeah i i'm going with like nordolet with 3-0 here if i'm it's going to be 3-0
Artem Taranov: yeah just from looking and like uh maybe i'm not understanding anything correctly but just looking by the power and the styles i'm assuming nordoled is able to top roll and pronate with the buckle and he has the hand control right you know because he's a little shorter i'm assuming yeah and minogue is being taller guy and not having that um i don't know probably that arm to really like create the same pronation movement i believe
Artem Taranov: nor do it can uh really do something here and okay so you you think it's going to be a whitewash three zero yeah oh I mean the old mean dog is he has a crazy pronation and get something in there right and we see in three one but uh it seems like if the internet makes me believe that nor the lead is stronger I was really impressed with Vendagas uh against Justin Bishop in the setup
Paul Linn: like to me that was the separating factor it wasn't power it wasn't hand strength it wasn't like post post go uh adjustments i thought mendagas was really really proficient at controlling like the optics of the setup
Paul Linn: Um, and I think that could be a deciding factor. So is Nordelag going to be able to deal with that in the moment, the misdirection and a lot of stuff that he's doing. Mindaugas I thought was as crafty as anybody in the setup. So, um, I, I'm going to, you know, and I also, I'll kind of go with my gut a little bit on this or my, uh, my, my, uh, yeah, I'll go with my, uh,
Paul Linn: my affinity towards Mindaugas. I think he's a cool-ass dude, and I'm going to go ahead. I'm going to go with Mindaugas because I do think it's going to be a very hard-fought match. And if he wins, if Mindaugas wins, we might be looking at something similar to the Justin Bissett match, something that goes 3-2 and maybe is decided by the buckle.
Paul Linn: Yeah, perhaps. This is somewhere where I believe New Doggis is an underdog, but he has the power. He has the time to, you know, change the score. I think he's a dog, man. Like, all the nine games and the stuff that I've seen him doing, like, backstage and everything, like... Yeah, he's pretty strong. Yeah.
Artem Taranov: we have a falling at our super chat from todd and oleg's love child does this super chat go to engen i sure hope so engen is the modern day and father of our master
Artem Taranov: this is true uh and the money go directly to they go directly to england they do go directly to england so you are correct i'm i'm eventually getting my cut out of it but um you know hey artem don't be telling people that they're not called super chat i got you i got hey i want to make sure we're clear there's no lawsuits let me know here but yes money go directly to england guys so
Artem Taranov: all right so you go women's i guess i'm gonna go with nor the left so it's we kind of have good disagreement here i like it i like it so now match number 12 we got chan show and david aru are a bully okay you want me to go first on this one you're going first
Artem Taranov: You go first because I believe you filled me in. I'm obviously familiar with Chance. I kind of was one of the first people where Chance started arm wrestling. Been there, know that. And Adit is from Georgi. And I don't know his exact level of placing. I know he beat a bunch of people, but I don't know exactly where he's at on his own. So I know most of what I know about Adit.
Paul Linn: is, you know, obviously we were at West versus West and he was there helping coach the Georgi and everything else. So I saw him there, but didn't know really what what his status was as a puller at the time. And then Chance reached out with the Max and Chance, you know, he's concerned and sent some videos to take a look at and
Paul Linn: There's some videos out there where he's pulling with like LeVon in a deep hook and making them work. And, you know, there's like he's doing some impressive stuff in a deep hook. The real question is, can he set that hook against Chance? And we all know how hard it is to hook Chance cleanly. Now, I think if the match goes in a hook, it's to be stay all day. I just think Chance is set up.
Paul Linn: His back pressure, his lock pronation is solid. I don't think that there's going to be a clean hook set. And because of that, I give Chance the edge for sure.
Paul Linn: now the tide could turn really quickly if a stop happens or if a stop happens you know maybe without the hand um and and chance gets dragged into deep water we could see those tides turn uh but i don't i don't i think this is probably going to look very similar to maybe a more fought a more hard-fought version of the zurab match uh-huh okay
Paul Linn: so i'm trying to see is there any footage of david's competing like i have not i'm sure there is i have not done personal research to see actual competition matches i've only seen uh the links that chance sent me um and most of them were practice footage very impressive very very impressive in a deep book
Artem Taranov: yeah because i'm not seeing the what was the actual weight of david if he were to compete in where he competed at uh when i saw when i saw him the eye test would put him at around 260 pounds my guess would be somewhere between 255 270. somewhere around so he if he were to compete he will compete at supers
Paul Linn: I would think, or a guy who cuts to 242. Okay. Similar to chance. I got tricky. So a little bit different, but similar stature to chance. Okay. Short arm, big bicep, a lot of shoulders.
Artem Taranov: Man, for the sake of the argument, I will bet on David just because you're going with Chance. But from just hearing what you said, I have to go with Chance myself here too. Right. Because this is not a blind match where we just don't know we're going to bet. From the information that you guys have received, you just explained to me that Chance is like the clear winner of this one. But again, not knowing true power of David here. Yes, yes.
Artem Taranov: you know i'm good yeah i'm gonna go ahead and say it's three zero for chance because if david's able to beat or win one then yeah then it could change really quickly yeah yeah then i mean it can be three two with chance against winning the first two
Paul Linn: Yeah. And then we take it from there. That's what it can be. Again, we're not too familiar, I guess, on the entire. I think the whole match comes down to a stop. Can a stop be achieved? You know what I mean? Can can can a lane be prevented like in the first second after the go?
Artem Taranov: if not i think it's chances there hold on there's something changing my opinion somebody in the chat said from okay sam said i think our bullet finished top three at 110 kilos at 12 19. okay 110. okay that was that being said i think it's going to be three zero to beat okay just off of that just off of that 110 what's the weight cat do we know uh i don't think chances losing weight for it
Artem Taranov: Right. Yeah. Well, neither will be the thing. I'm just I'm just that's how much credit I give to that's how much credit I will give to WF top finisher. Right. And and with that being said, if chance not beats him three zero, that's really cool. Yeah. I respect that completely. That's where I'm kind of going with it. So 110 makes sense. 110 makes sense. Like thinking back on like his his bone structure, 110 makes sense.
Artem Taranov: All right, hell yeah. All right. So you we both are gonna well, hello is what I know.
Artem Taranov: i'm going with david to go with his chance right okay good good cool cool all right cool i mean i that's just from this but i don't think he made top three he was four left and he's lefty oh don't play with my money like that ah i'm getting my i'm getting my f8 back
Artem Taranov: hey come on that's still are they flying about to be the left-handed oh come on i've got right-handed chance three zero i'm supposed here okay okay and we do we did have 4.99 super child is stating artem's cut
Artem Taranov: yeah thank you for my money thanks todd's and oleg's love child uh justin bishop saying hi uh saying um sup fellas hopefully i can get to destin and see y'all yeah see you soon see you soon yes sir that'll be awesome all right so alijan muradov versus oleg petrenko left-handed
Artem Taranov: I can go first. This one is... Go, go, go. You see what Oleg did with Zurep? Yeah.
Artem Taranov: was great alijan just destroyed everybody at worlds but i was re-watching this footage at worlds he i mean he beat people he's not supposed to be as far as his weight goes in my opinion but as far as the name i cannot know nobody there like i'm not a super wf guy right like to know the competition
Artem Taranov: but there was nobody like that like i know myself personally as a name right so at the same time like i i mean it's impressive but i don't really know how impressive so with that being said like we obviously know without even that without that we know the allergens left is also like it's still it's beastly so humanolic it's it's a tough one um
Artem Taranov: man i don't know i don't know i mean they both performed really really good with the left and
Artem Taranov: uh alexander is coming back of kind of like a two years off i think due to his ban and then well now competing like everybody yeah yeah but now competing now absolutely like you know he's shown that he's able to compete in the high performance at worlds so that's already proven like all right he's he's back and he's back greatly so uh
Artem Taranov: don't know who who you got so i can bet against you see i thought he was going first you can't do that i'm gonna go man well you know what simply due to the fact i already met oleg and he was the sweetest guy ever i'm i'm going with oleg because he performed well he looked strong and i believe his frame could be a little bit bigger i don't know what's allergen's actual weight
Artem Taranov: what's the way cat for this one 105. i don't know what what's the oleg's ranked at is he that 105 class one oh it has to be 105. okay then i'm assuming maybe that so yeah um yeah i don't know how much of allergen's fully one tandem she carries
Paul Linn: that's what i mean like what what did he compete at in in waft he competed at the uh super open super heavy it's like 110 plus i don't think he carries that you know what i mean you know i mean he may be like he may be like 225 guy you know what i mean so i don't know all right well i'll go with alex now because uh it's kazakhstan man it's kazakhstan they're they're savages so you can take a leak
Paul Linn: okay i like holy too i mean he he i agree with you sweetest dude ever okay uh so according to eng in allergen was under under 100 kilos but she put under 100 and pulled the open yeah yeah
Artem Taranov: that's more data that's all i need to know and i'm very comfortable with this now and killed everybody too yeah okay so uh match number 10 and but before we go for the sake of the live stream there they did confirm that david took forced right-handed 110 kilos so so he took force on both left and right okay okay it's respectable
Artem Taranov: very cool it i'm i'm still giving this chance i'm still going this chance as my as my latest uh okay match number 10 the reed osmar lee versus corey west left-handed um corey three zero oh really zero okay um yep i'm go i'm gonna go with farid okay good
Artem Taranov: i'm gonna go with farid because uh seeing what farid and farid's good both both hands but what he is with vitality right-handed what he this life right hand is uh i mean he did to everybody but zaur and he recently well i don't think he gets such a great showing at the recent amc tournament because he just lost to
Artem Taranov: I think Gregorio should beat him. He's the Zlaty Tur champion. You know, I mean, it's also not a nobody, but in a great shape. So,
Artem Taranov: uh farid is a great guy i don't think many people are familiar with him nowadays especially with him taking a pretty big break he haven't competed in like what three more years than that and now coming back in a great shape you know yeah 300 pounds uh no injuries uh i'm gonna go with farid yeah i think you got the experience yeah corey is uh corey's hitting a new level and i think corey is rising to
Paul Linn: um the title that he is getting as america's north america's next best super heavyweight especially left arm you just especially after seeing what pablo just did to corey left-handed nah okay all right well get my beer ready yeah so uh i want an extra cold too okay well i mean you'll talk to the partner 32 degrees
Artem Taranov: will see on the weather in turkey okay okay so we have your boy out here craig tully and david samusha okay do you want to go first on this one hold on hold on hold on
Paul Linn: Or do you want me to hold on? Do you think Corey just kills for it? Oh, oh, I'm like, why are we not even talking how definitely we're going to go? It's a killer. I don't know. Look, look, look, look. I mean, we're, we're talking about, listen, not to take anything away from free at all. I'm just saying that Corey is hitting a new level. He is over 400 pounds. He is getting better. Every time we see him, he has no injuries to speak of. He just treated, um, Cody merit, like he wasn't on the table.
Paul Linn: um and he's still like he's still just sheer power and he's just figuring like set up game and things like he's figuring that out now he's gotten this far without really worrying about any of it you know and i just think his trajectory figuring it out hey farid figured it out 20 years ago
Paul Linn: whatever whatever you need to tell yourself to make you feel better is okay with me i'm just saying get my beer ready and keep it cold i just wanted to know like you know listen i like i like cory too so part of that's coming from the heart the other thing is i really do think that if somebody's going to carry the flag for super heavyweight sports it's got to be him oh yeah for sure for sure
Paul Linn: so yeah and i think he's ready for this stage i think he's you know like like life like where he's at right now is a good place and i think we're only going to see more and more like higher level like he's going to keep hitting new clicks
Artem Taranov: okay yeah i mean i respect it i agree with what you said dude i only disagree in the fact that he's big in farid other than that yes he is definitely the guy so but we'll see yeah i'm thinking that's all i wanted to know but i'm thinking farid beats him in a in a decent fashion i think corey will probably slow it but i think farid smashes him three zero yeah he's three zero okay yeah yeah three zero four equal okay
Artem Taranov: So match number nine. Okay, coming back here with Craig Toohey and David Samushia. I would like for you to correct you going first because you are familiar with those gentlemen. So there's a lot of variables in this.
Paul Linn: so i really i really like samusha like and i and i i train with a guy who's from his hometown in goga um and he says he speaks the world of the beat in that davit has the potential to be the pound for pound best like georgian arm wrestler ever to live like meaning he basically when he pulled me he was all but off the couch
Paul Linn: you know he was heavier he's trimming down now he's in shape he's only going to get keep getting better and i think we're kind of seeing that even though there was a little scare with daniel um but i mean the fact that he was over able to overcome that first round win that made it so much more impressive so i do think that david even though he's losing weight is getting stronger and getting better that said
Paul Linn: Craig Tuye has an arm wrestle with somebody his same size in like forever. So we're going to see an opportunity for Craig to basically, you know, maybe cut a few pounds for the first time since he was pulling them 142s way back in the day. Right. So, yeah, we're going to see an instance where Craig isn't stuffing himself with sushi to try and make 198, you know, get to that level. He's walking around at like 185, 187, and he's smoking everybody around here. And I know what both of them feel like.
Paul Linn: So I think it will come down to a stylistic setup battle. I think Craig has the ability with his surges to surge through David, but the match is going to be won or lost in the setup and the initiation. Initiation not meaning Craig's normal explosive side pressure hit, but rather a positioning, you know, getting to a spot where David is hanging on to him.
Paul Linn: If Craig can get Daveed to hang on to him and then go sideways, I think we see Craig win. We see him win the match probably definitively. If Craig cannot get that in the setup, in the initiation, I think it could go the other way. That said, my money is on Craig because I know his skill set, his tools. The only thing that he doesn't have
Paul Linn: as far as the advantage against the lead is going to be that long lever. He doesn't have a super long lever, but I do have Craig picked in this one. I do have Craig picked in this one. I think we could see Craig, maybe we could see a 3-1 or a 3-2, maybe based off of some elbow fouls, but the added centimeter is going to make a difference for Craig's drag as well on the pad, the added centimeter.
Artem Taranov: is a comment from jason marlowe about how many elbow falls will be called during this match yeah there's a factor with craig and but i think both of them are fairly short as far as the lever goes i don't think craig going to have a problem of kicking that wrist girl and hopping in right i think he can and as you said that extra that extra size of the pad will give him a little extra room to bring it forward and bring it back so
Artem Taranov: i like what you said i think if if the match stops and craig's able to bring his service pretty far down he can be the winner of this match but but you know david dust has the ability to be there it cannot be the traditional side pressure surge if it is straight sideways wrist to wrist david is stopping that
Paul Linn: Yeah. And his shoulder in there. And then the match goes to deep water. And that's not where Craig wants to be. Right. The hit has to be precise.
Artem Taranov: right and craig's style of hooking it's really more like as i said more like a hit on the bicep sort of because like when you see him pull todd hutchings that's totally different thing like that's like they don't work out for each other so yeah might be able to see the same thing here if david's somewhat with the same angle he could be the favorite here but yeah um i'm not quite sure i mean power wise what do you think i'm gonna go you're going with craig here or david
Artem Taranov: going with craig okay i'm gonna go with david just for the sake of the argument yeah and i like i like david a lot man i mean like i'm rooting for this guy in every match except i'll be out there i'll be out there working for craig you know i mean uh as for everybody i'll be on that side of the stage you know helping us to be done i'll do it but for the sake of argument for this yeah when is the beat but uh yeah from what you just said and for what you just explained i can see it going
Artem Taranov: i don't know i guess i don't know how the power matchups it might go three one three two craig with him stopping the match and blasting forward or being able to blast you know without getting caught up and falls yeah but if david stops it then be going with david here saying that's kind of how it's going to go well when we get together in a couple weeks here and we work on the stuff i'm sure we'll talk a lot about you know the the angle just finished yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so
Artem Taranov: going back with two Corey West we got Corey West and yeah yeah that's Corey too you got Corey there okay um I'm gonna go with Corey right-handed for sure I'm pretty confident in it and yeah I'm not he's he's if you
Paul Linn: you gotta this guy's top role proof like he he contains michael todd all the time it's all he does like you got somebody king's moving in your hand and you're trying to suck him down you're going the worst possible lane against the king's move ever all day every day that's all you train against that makes that hand and not to mention it's the size of a grizzly bears um it makes it top role proof so unless you're gonna go at this dude like the only lane is to go at him
Paul Linn: go at his arm go at his bicep take him beside it there is no once he has his shoulder on top of you he's just he's a load and yeah and he's got rotation too i mean more on the left arm he can get in tight and rotate with that left right doesn't have quite as much rotation but it still has the sheer side pressure okay interesting
Paul Linn: um i mean i'll have to agree with you yeah as i said i'm going with corey here as well uh but now now the only factor here the factor here to think about okay if you're if you are right on the previous if you are correct on your previous judgment on the left arm which i am which i have let's say if you are if you are then that becomes a variable in the right arm because we all know what it's like to compete on different arms in the same day
Paul Linn: and if you don't have the outcome especially with your dominant arm previous to your non-dominant arm that could become a factor in this match now if he walks through that first match and he wins that or even if he has a war and wins it i think this one becomes more of a more of a one-sided match yeah yeah energy's everything man mentality energy everything
Artem Taranov: Yeah, but just seeing the way in my head how I see those levels, I'm still seeing Farid walking through Corey, but Corey beating Arif. That's where I'm at. So I do believe it's possible. Yeah, that's interesting, though.
Paul Linn: so okay and now we have this good woman match we have gabriella vasconcellos and barbora okay i i'll go first i will never ever ever bet against gabby okay never never and i don't know a whole whole lot about barbora but you're going you can tell me film me in but i'll tell you right now i just i can't bet again gabby i think she's so first off she's just like the sweetest person ever
Paul Linn: and she's a savage a total savage and she is like female she has women's arm wrestling you know so i can't bet against her in any way shape or form so tell me why i'm wrong
Artem Taranov: Oh, I'm not quite sure. I think, uh, like anger help us out. And I think last time, I think the last time I seen any in common, I think he did mention something like Barbora, like walk through Hill closet worlds, like the super girls, she has killed all of them. So we kind of have to take, that's the main thing they have taken into consideration, right? So she's like way well above your competition. So we got, yeah. Yeah. I mean,
Artem Taranov: uh i do believe here that i'm going with this guy so okay so ankin is helping out us with the stats uh that's that's an impressive stat that's impressive uh barbara is 62 275 pounds okay i you know what if i was 62 275 i might be playing on sundays right i would trade stats with her
Artem Taranov: man yeah that's that i mean that's that's a lot i mean that's it's a great size to be arm wrestling with right like she's i mean you've seen that the way how she can be like she gotta have a long arm right definitely lever lever advantage she's able to put that weight on there as well so
Artem Taranov: so from that perspective it has to be interesting i'm not unfortunately i'm not too familiar with your styles i think that's what will make a difference because gabriella has two holes right you've seen the sarah you able to find stuff is uh gabriella i do believe it might come out stylistically too like because coming back to sarah i've seen sarah make mistakes so and that's size difference
Artem Taranov: and yeah mainly the height you know i mean like because uh gabrielle is not six two right yeah not even close so uh so with that being said i do we don't know gabriella is strong i think we all we have to think about is is barbara able to look at that match
Artem Taranov: of sharing Gabriela and maybe apply and see the same holes that were happening there, right? Because I think that's what I will do. Because that was like the only time recently Gabriela looked like a human, right? Unless you're back to like A1 tournaments where, you know, Gabriela and Irina pulled. But that's what you have to look at and see. And if Barbora is able to do the same angles, I think we might be able to see something. But if not, then yeah, Gabriela. Yeah.
Paul Linn: i'm with it i'm with um that's really interesting though yeah angan said when you guys see unreal you will be surprised with your size i don't yeah well i mean the stats say everything right so but i see what i'm gonna say it might be she she might be like we're talking about probably three three inches on on elbow to fingertips
Artem Taranov: right because there's something there's something about a woman that built like it like big athletes yes I've known so another day somebody was bringing like somebody that I know was dating a woman and they brought this child of them 11 year old with the hand as big as mine yeah 11 year old girl and yeah and is just I mean
Artem Taranov: technically as this build goes your hand is going to be it's already bigger than mine I'm just happened to have like my size overalls an adult is bigger but your hand is non-developed it's the same size I'm like oh wow yeah it's gonna be a lot right so that's that's we might be able to see if your barbarous hand could probably should probably take you by the hand right
Artem Taranov: and to me that's the hardest thing to overcome in arm wrestling is a monstrous hand with strength to go along with it so i guess that leaves me and you were saying if gabriella is able to contain it she'll take it but if barbara can apply the same strategies as sarah i think she has the build to do so she's 22 years old
Paul Linn: oh and is killing us yeah in one year we'll be live on a female arm wrestling oh man and you're the promoter you're not supposed to have an opinion on this now he is giving us very well yeah okay okay that was not a neutral style i know i i know i know i know but i mean i listen if she's 22 that makes her super super impressive for sure however
Paul Linn: then like experience and all that good stuff that has to be in in gabriella's favor too so i mean how technical are you at 22 could you be absolutely you know or could you be so physically dominant for sure you know but i i gotta i gotta think that that kind of favors gabriella a little bit right okay yeah with the with the age difference and experience for sure uh i i just saw your message you're dumb
Artem Taranov: you know while we're on live what's wrong with you guys so uh you know what the kids would be monsters i do i do believe i do believe that the it's what you said being 22. uh yeah i i mean i the thing it takes really
Artem Taranov: that that amount of years and all that to understand how you should approach a match but just saying where the experience can matter here right but if she approaches it properly beforehand yeah good strategy and she sticks to it and god forbid she has power to do so oh i know right that's the scariest part but yeah i can see the experience i think the experience is mostly comes to the tournament yeah
Artem Taranov: Supermatch pooling, if you can pick a strategy and you can pick another one, the first doesn't work out, you kind of look at the same person. So that's where. Yeah, it's a little different, though, too, because you're only got a couple of minutes between like that. So that's tricky experience. How fast can you think and how well? OK, OK, OK. I guess it's technically if you can build an approach properly, experience doesn't have to matter so, so much. Right.
Artem Taranov: you've seen that we're like did some amateur pulling somebody he's not supposed to and all of a sudden he's winning because of that weird thing that she does works but yeah experience does matter here if you're in deep waters and you have to think fast and you don't have ability to think
Paul Linn: Right. To me, I think, like, from my own perspective, the trickiest part about experience and the thing that separates guys like John is the in-match transitions, the in-match adjustments. Yeah. Okay. We all can adjust between rounds, you know, but it's the experienced pullers that can adjust in-match. And John's just masterful at it. And you're also saying, I said in one year, not in January. Yeah.
Artem Taranov: okay thank you for the clarity so he's he's being neutral he's being neutral yeah he's always neutral he's always neutral so with all that being said uh where are we going before we move into the next one huh well what's our verdict on the gabi and barbara i i got gabby i got gabby you got gabby i got gabby
Artem Taranov: I got more now. Yeah, good. Yeah, because you heard LaVon 2023 LaVon. Not in January, late 23. I'll be I'll be rooting for Gabriela if she's in the reporters. But, you know, but, you know. All right, what's the next one? I love it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just I'm just still debating on the on the experience of the debate. But yeah, yeah.
Paul Linn: Cameron is a wrap. Our number six match. Okay. This one is really, really interesting. And I, I, I, I don't know enough about Curtis Cameron. Can you, I mean, like I see it all, like, obviously I follow poor job on, on everything.
Artem Taranov: know and i see him doing some impressive stuff and i hear devin giving his like confirmation of his greatness and everything but have you have you pulled with him artem i know you've been up there man i think we got to pull a little bit in the side table and from seeing what i've seen like personally man i really needed your positivity for here because i'm about i'm about to say that um cameron gonna get killed by the rap and
Artem Taranov: now what i'm saying gonna look pretty bad because paul is not here but from experience standpoint from power standpoint uh zurep is the favorite here absolutely you just missed me saying how i heard it i got my headphones in
Artem Taranov: i heard it give me some positive energy what do you need man uh i'm supporting pork chop team uh curtis is there power wise right she is not weak by any means oh i know i know that he's strong
Artem Taranov: i don't believe he is the rap strong i don't think he beats rap at this point is he there in that weight class yeah he is uh but not in that tier i do believe you might see we might you might see a good match but he's not being to rap uh this this one here is three zero so what i what i want to see more than anything is i because listen we we know that neither of these guys are going outside like
Paul Linn: i would love to see like what i would like to see more than anything is a hook match in the strap
Paul Linn: would like to see it in a strap very similar to like the ron bath match i think if we're going to see a war we're going to need to see them tied together because they don't know what poor chop's hand is like like zorab still definitely has rotation inside and if his fingers get open we could see it be more one-sided than pork chops side pressure and you know heart is going to show i would like to see them both like opt for the strap and go like let's see it for real like so like
Paul Linn: I think Zurab is 100% the favorite. And I like Zurab. And I see him doing these crazy stuff on Instagram. And I love it. You know, I like all of it. I'm telling you, this guy is going to come to the U.S. on a visa. And I'm going to train with him constantly. I love the way he trains. Meathead mentality. I love it. But I want to see them like, guys, if you're listening, go to the Strat. Just tell the referee we're going straight to the Strat round one. And let's see it. Because I think that's where we could see the grinder.
Paul Linn: but i do i have zurab as the favorite but i'm supporting poor chop like i'm hoping devin's like assessment is on point you know what i mean and i gotta support team west but i do think zurab is the favorite
Artem Taranov: i got you well according to the chat everybody in charge convinced it's going to be a close match i don't think it could be and getting refers to that one is 50 50 somebody said 60 40. i unfortunately don't see it this way like if you asked me like hey can this set up uh cameron's rap
Paul Linn: I'm not going to hate it. I'll be sure. Yeah, let's do it. But I think it's 3-0 Zurab. 100%. I think in order to beat Zurab, if you're not somebody like Todd Hutchins, that you have to take the chance to all route. You have to kind of keep him out of his lane.
Paul Linn: And I think poor chop chop is going to like, welcome that lane, go right in it, which I love, you know what I mean? I love that. And like, after Zurab's match at West versus West, he's like, give me Todd Hutchings. Cause I'm going to go right there. And I love that. That's awesome. Like, I love that mentality. Let's just go there and see, you know, I want to see it. Like, I want to see the match stop. I don't want that. I, the last thing I want to see is this, you know?
Artem Taranov: right and zero is funny too another day he was doing like 200 pound wrist curls and i'm like i'm like i thought you're gonna do biceps he's like no no no no biceps is coming let's say wait must be nice must be nice yeah yeah all right so who you got on the score i'm like i said i know you have favorite azura azura but you want to support the best i'm gonna i'm gonna support kurt curtis cam
Paul Linn: I'm going to support him. I can't, I think, you know what, I'm hoping this match is like just, I hope it's so 50-50 and evenly matched that we see like this wonderful like hook war, you know, that is, we all want to see a 3-2, like a great match that goes back and forth. But sadly, if both people are going inside, it's usually one or two rounds and then someone emerges, you know. So I'm really, really hoping that it goes that route and
Artem Taranov: hopefully curtis can pull it out for the west okay okay that's good i'm going with three zero maybe three one for the rep okay yeah i think i think if it goes their abs way it's probably three zero here's a ghost all right we got match number five we got rustem babaev and paul lynn
Artem Taranov: Don't ask me about that. I do believe Rousseau might have slight advantage on the experience here. Yeah. Slight advantage on experience and pretty much everything.
Artem Taranov: no so uh as as okay here's gonna be my assessment of y'all's build right so rostam been considered as one of the worst uh genetics as far as this european can go right he's short small hand small everything pretty much yet that's how he
Artem Taranov: unfortunately that's how we he was able to gain status of a legend of being able to just applaud for his opponents like pauline he's having the same status he has right and that statue that you know desires a lot of stuff but he's able to do the stuff that he's been doing so um man that's a tough one uh i want to know what's your strategy we talked about it before
Paul Linn: We're going to go as hard as we can. We're just going to go as hard as we can. We're preparing as much as we can. Where are you taking us, Paul? As hard as we can. Huh? Where are you taking us, Paul? Were you taking us hardly where? You're taking us hardly outside or inside? Where are the poultry fields? I don't know. I don't know. Plan A, Plan B, Plan C. So you don't know. You don't know there's a plan. There's always a plan. Because if you don't know, because I know Rustam knows.
Artem Taranov: yeah i know where he's going i know where he's going no because i have to go with rust and pull but if you don't know of course you got to go with rustin you'd be a dum-dum not to go with rust yeah but if you tell me that you know where your trade is going to maybe i'll go with paul i'm not trying to convince you well i mean i just want to hear it hold let me ask the chat chat y'all let me know because i'm kind of there's conflict of interest here right like
Artem Taranov: Engin said Rustam is a newbie. Yeah. Engin, don't be trolling us right now. I like, okay, hold on. I like what people are saying. Prime Rustam wins 3-0, but we don't know his current form. Yeah. Performance Enhancing Pancakes just agrees with Engin.
Paul Linn: Can Paul pull through full sideways? Paul. The lane can't be directly sideways. It can't be directly sideways. Right, because we know where Todd Hutchings. Yep. Well, the Todd Hutchings match, when you rewatch that and really break it down, it's very interesting the way he sets up. Rustam sets up differently.
Paul Linn: He sets up with a slight dump knuckle. He's all set up for explosion. Never goes to the strap. It's all initiation. Actually, I thought his setup in that match was masterful against Todd. If you rewatch it, just rewatch it and take a look at his setup. Exactly how he sets up. Where his pressure is applied through the wrist and where he initiates. It's masterful. I don't think that I'm going to get that same setup.
Paul Linn: interesting uh engen just said that yesterday zura predicted this match as paul wins it oh that's because me and zura we're like this means i'm switching my i'm switching my i'm switching my uh my support i'm going with my georgian brother sorry i apologize yeah i give love to those who give love to you zara have all day three zero me and artem switch that up no fa on that one
Artem Taranov: i love the georgians i really do i love the georgians they're awesome oh yeah the rap was awesome so yeah i mean i know you're kind of out of your opinion because i know you probably want to win it uh as far as the chat goes nobody wants you to say your plan and oh i mean i don't know uh hoping
Paul Linn: so just so from what i know from digging around and and um do me some convincing paul well there's no i'm not i'm not listening i'm not on here to convince anybody that i'm gonna win that's not my goal uh but what i've been digging around rustam has been very active he's not coming off the couch at all um
Paul Linn: which to me is what I want. I mean, you could sit back here, you put yourself in my position and say, all right, you know, what is going to give you the best variables to win, the best variables to win. And Rustam shows up like eating Doritos and drinking beer all day, just living a good life in the UK. But that is not, in fact, what he's doing. He's training with Paul Maiden and that team out there. He's training very hard multiple times a week.
Paul Linn: And, uh, according to them, he started in a manageable fashion. He is no longer in a manageable fashion anymore. So that is, I mean, if, if you're going to get the opportunity to face a legend, you want to get them in their best possible form. I don't want no asterisk around that. Like if I, if, if I, if I somehow find a way to win, I don't want an asterisk.
Paul Linn: And if I lose 3-0, I surely don't want to lose 3-0 to an untrained up version of Rustam. So I do think that I'm going to get the best version of him.
Paul Linn: And I have been talking to Paul Maiden and we've been communicating back and forth a little bit with Rustam and he's taking the match seriously. And that in itself is enough respect for me that I appreciate it, that he's taking me serious because I could understand if I were in his shoes and I wasn't gonna take somebody like me serious, I could understand that. There's a case for that. So him preparing for me as if I'm a legitimate opponent is respect enough.
Artem Taranov: So I'm going to do my best to show him that exact same respect. All right. All right. That's that's good to hear. There's a question in the chat where we can take it there. Ertem, if you will pull against Rostov, where will you go for to higher the chances?
Artem Taranov: that's a good question because yeah there is a plan a plan b because plan a i will i will top roll i will go for that i will see what tim bresnan did how defense i will test that hand because i know he has him to be smaller than mine right i know the setup must get feel a little bit different for me and if that doesn't work that's where you kind of have to be like well i mean if he takes it inside you know we're going inside
Artem Taranov: So I'll be just keep trying to roll until it doesn't work and it beats into my head that, you know, maybe trying to open the hook is the best option. But that's just off the rip, right? Just kind of assuming that's, you know, kind of knowing Rustam's career, I have to really watch and see if that hook is even openable, you know what I mean? Maybe it's always top roll.
Artem Taranov: but well even zolo have go in it as well so you do have to see how much predation he engaged in all of that so little details i'll definitely roll first because as a top ruler you have to assume like if you're stronger than somebody and you're just able to roll you're rolling right you now now they have to kind of worry about what they're doing right you just have to worry about
Paul Linn: kick into the hand, kick into the rollout. And if that works, that works, right? But then if it doesn't, then you're playing around that hook. Yeah, the whole hand drag open top roll that Tim Bresnan applies with everybody is a very interesting avenue for sure. That's just very tricky to replicate. His pronation comes from a different place. Shoulder driven through the thumb pad. Yeah, it's interesting.
Artem Taranov: I pulled with Tim enough to know, but that's definitely has to be in the game plan. Well, I'm excited about this one. I, you know, for the experience standpoint and how much I love you, Paul, and I am representing a little arm shirt. I'm going to pull it. I'm going to.
Paul Linn: i appreciate the vote of confidence i would rather have you say 3-0 rustem because i like to be the underdog just saying i like you know what you know what i mean that just means being pulled in realistically there we go that's what i need that's what i need that's what i need
Artem Taranov: i'm gonna give you the good adam wrzynski treatment because every time adam asked me i'm telling you he's getting smashed and he and he prints it out puts it in his bathroom and over dominates that's that is what football players do give me locker room material please well i can i'll send you some pictures it's all good
Artem Taranov: Well, I mean, I would like to hope to see a good match, right? Obviously, if I'm saving my money, Rustam smashes you, but... Well, that's the ultimate goal. At the end of the day... I would like to see a 3-2 pull in. I want a 3-2 pull in. Win or lose, we want to put on a good show. Okay. One way or another. It's the ultimate goal. Match number four. Farid Ismaili, Genadi Kvikvinia. Hmm...
Artem Taranov: that's we discussed it with uh angin and travis the other day and skill going pretty deeply in here and it's going to be interesting uh it's pretty even match and again i think i'm a farid fan so i'm as a fan i'm just going to go with farid but gennady i think can win adjust as well yeah i'm going to go with gennady i'm going to go you're the team georgia today right yeah i am team georgia pretty much all the time
Paul Linn: like them guys but yeah i'm gonna go i'm gonna go with ganadi because i think he just has a huge heart i think he's just like he's a savage when like the match with dave and he's just a dog so whether whether he is the favorite or not i'm gonna root hard for him for sure because it's hard not to root for a guy like that you know bang and said at some point
Artem Taranov: i think we were talking about the locker room material oh what do you say that's something yeah man this is going to be interesting so yeah um
Artem Taranov: Genadi and Farid, got you. So you're going Genadi and Farid. I'm going with Farid. It's right-handed. I understand, you know, as Engin was breaking it down, I know like mine and Travis' pace was changing. So it's going to be interesting. That's like the top five.
Paul Linn: we get into some hot mad go either way. So, but yeah, just for the sake of argument going with Farid, but you're not, you're not. Huge telling match for like the top guys, like there's so much data being told in these, these top two matches at West versus West, you know, there's, there's so much like, as far as like how people would perceive rankings that are on the line with these next couple.
Artem Taranov: Oh, I think, I think, I think, and, and he was making fun of Andrea. Cause Andrea, Jack, the lot that said, I don't remember Rustam ever losing his hand, maybe against the town and then engine. Correct. Okay. Right. Funny. Okay. Match number three, Michael Todd and kid, they're going to buy it, man.
Artem Taranov: you go yeah i've so i've talked about it and i think me and you've touched maybe on some other time before too where you know as i've said for me a lot of times not the biggest fan of the uh you know king's move or just something else type of fight not either however uh there's so many every time michael todd brings new variables right it's a different weight yep
Artem Taranov: Great. Ongarbaev is also such a different, interesting build. How is he going to approach it? He has enough lengthness to go up high and maybe be able to bring that cup. But does he have enough of that cup to help with that lengthness of his? I don't know. Yeah, it's funny because I was at Monster Factory with Mike. Right before I left, we were talking on Sunday and the match came up and
Paul Linn: And I made the point that, like, you know, you have to understand why people would have you as the underdog. Like, he was talking about everybody thinks I'm going to get smashed, blah, blah, blah. You have to, like, look at it objectively and understand why people are giving you the underdog in this match. It's because we have a known quantity with Ongarbaev. You know, we've seen him against John. We've seen him come back, like,
Paul Linn: We know his form is good enough against John. We know all his previous data. He's hovered around the same weight classes, you know, and we know he has that post-cop role deep cut that can potentially be a problem for a Kings move.
Paul Linn: so we those are known quantities and then you enter michael and michael has just lost a mega amount of weight he's gonna be pulling not at 250 but 231 um he's coming off the bicep thing you know we we just there's a lot of i don't knows you know so it's like if if vegas is making the line vegas is going to make agrabah of the favorite because of the known quantities and that's all they have to handicap it off of
Paul Linn: now for me i'm a big believer in michael todd's like heart and we also have the extra centimeter on the pad which i don't care what you say with michael's move and the way he operates that's a big deal um so there is part of me
Paul Linn: that understands that Ongarbaev is the on paper favorite. But I think like understanding Michael Todd's body size, like his body composition, he's been pushing himself to be a super heavyweight at a six foot one and a half, six foot two frame for a long time with a smaller hand, without the genetic abilities to, you know, predispositions to be able to compete at that level. And yet he's still done it through heart and through his move and mastering it and all that good stuff.
Paul Linn: um now he's coming down in weight closer to his natural body weight i would think the power loss or whatever would not be as much losing the weight so i have michael todd favored in this one i do not i do not think it is a sweep i think that michael stands the chance of potentially being flashed early
Artem Taranov: or having issues early on. I do. I also think though, the minute he can sink that, that King's move and anger bias risk gets compromised. It's all over. Okay. That's interesting because I do see considering seeing how kidder golly put John, there is an option, I think for the risk to go. Right. But what's interesting of seeing people pulling Michael, that's how they approach it and how they change the styles and what they're going for. Right.
Artem Taranov: like pushkar likes go for like that explosive stop if something happens there's an elbow fall right i think trubin was going for like more of a climbs and stuff so peter galley has that height as we said so he i mean can that hand go with mike's king's move absolutely can but
Artem Taranov: does the lengthness of his arm helps him maintain the wrist in and climbing over that's what i'm not sure so i'm not quite sure if i would call michael as a favorite here exactly but man he yeah he does this is such an interesting match at the end of the day this is super interesting and it could be one-sided either way but leading up to it it's super interesting let me shut this door
Artem Taranov: yeah i got you but i mean so with you saying ballsy michael i i see what you're saying i see that michael can do it but i don't know what i don't think i can say michael is the favorite here so no no no no no one paper agrabah is the favorite i got you i got you well uh who you got as a score then
Paul Linn: i i have it i have it three one three two three one or three two michael okay for michael yes uh-huh okay so i'm betting like let's say vegas gave it two to one odds i'm going with the dog i got you okay interesting um that's a hard one for me also but i'm gonna do i see michael as a winner
Artem Taranov: didn't i don't think michael could win this one now uh i see i don't know yeah this is a good one to disagree on this one it is so i mean that being said i'll go with kidder golly yeah
Artem Taranov: uh i'm gonna have to go now if i'm be if i'm betting in keter galley i'll have to go with uh three zero score i can i cannot give right michael if i'm going with skater galley right i agree i agree if it goes if it goes under vibes way it's probably gonna be three zero okay either way around yes but yeah and for the sake of our argument we go here if michael wins it am i mega surprised
Artem Taranov: i'm pretty surprised i'm pretty surprised michael rented but if he wins it in the fashion where you said yes i mean i can definitely see the lane of
Artem Taranov: I guess I'm really contradicting myself, but I kind of do see kindergarten losing that hand, right? It just whether it can he could pull without it? And will he pull through without it? Right? That's the only concern that I have. Because other than that, I have kindergarten reading it. It's just I keep the Michael King's move at that weight can be a problem for sure. So yeah, for sure. But yeah, kindergarten.
Artem Taranov: uh and chat seems to be agree with me uh number two john brzenk and iraq if you allow i'll start it here because i feel like i'm the only person that kind of goes with what i'm saying
Artem Taranov: i don't really see iraqli as a favorite as everybody i don't know i feel like everybody i talked to feel like that uh you know john is in deep waters here but i'm going with john as a good 3-0 here
Artem Taranov: uh maybe maybe the attitude of the chat will change right now we will see but usually so far the chat been kind of correct with us okay somebody so far said 50 50. there's jump zank uh i don't know if there's big arachnophants here gonna say they're actually gonna but
Artem Taranov: i've okay so far the chat is like hold on what planet is iraq the favorite but no yeah yeah yeah that's what it felt like to me from seeing commentary from all these people timmy turner says 50 50. richard gamrat says uh very match let me ask you this how tall how tall is uh agrabah
Paul Linn: Ongarbaev, I don't know, but are we talking to Rackley? I know, but tell me how tall Ongarbaev is. Oh, I don't know. I'm assuming he's from Kazakhstan and he rides horses to like 7'1". Okay. He's got to be taller than Rackley. His lever length has to be a little bit longer. I think Kidderghali Ongarbaev showed the lane of John's vulnerability. I think that he showed it, and I don't think that Rackley can simulate it.
Paul Linn: based off of his style. I mean, he is pseudo post top roll a little bit of dump a little bit more whole hand, like his strong hand back pressures crazy. But I don't I just I don't. And that that that post lane that the kid or golly kind of exploited through like that top knuckle. I just I don't think that Iraq we can do that. I don't. And I think that I mean,
Paul Linn: i don't know john's just getting better and better and better on his comeback tour like i i just i don't see i don't see this being where the buck stops you know and and we know we know like listen john's not gonna lose three times the same way unless he's totally outgunned in the setup so there's a chance there's a chance that that um iraqli uh takes a round
Artem Taranov: maybe even two you never know but I I don't see John losing I think John was just saying yeah John does has a history I guess so like losing one or two and you know readjusting are we gonna referee taking control uh oh really I thought
Artem Taranov: i really thought ungar biaf is really really tall i thought he i think he's like six three or six four in here six three really i thought he's much taller than that so engen says my guess is six two six three and he says and he says that iraqli is six three also yeah iraqli iraqli is surprisingly taller than expected
Paul Linn: until i met him when i met him i realized oh okay i see why you're going towards that 105 110 range because he does have the structure to carry yeah because all of a sudden you have to look up to him a little bit right
Artem Taranov: yeah yeah he's tall he ain't short yeah it's for sure okay I feel like his lever his lever like elbow to fingertips doesn't look as long yeah well and I think he's kind of jacked too you know I mean that forearm is big so I think yeah the bigger you are the shorter you look like you it could be perspective yeah perspective
Paul Linn: drop good 20 pounds of arachnid he would look like he is seven foot tall probably just like you know we've seen arachnid pull other smaller guys that we know you know in the past that lighter weights and he just didn't look he didn't look in those matches he didn't look as as clearly big as he is in real life maybe it's the way he sets up at the table i don't know
Paul Linn: Yeah, so something I've learned, like, so Rockley is, like, way bigger than I thought. Especially compared to John Gabayas. Yeah, he's big. But I still don't see him winning that one. I mean, I... I grabbed him. His hand is strong. His thumb pad's thick. But we're not talking about a John hand. You know what I mean? We're not talking about fingers. Each one looks like that, you know? With a thumb pad the size of a softball. And that hydraulic pronation. I just don't... I mean, to me...
Artem Taranov: i do believe he is able to sneak a win or two they will be i think that's that's fine i don't think it can be three zero i think we do talk about maybe three one maybe three two here but yeah john wins this one but this one was actually uh i would say iraq can bring in a good match i think so i think it'll be entertaining one way or another it's not gonna be quick
Artem Taranov: i do appreciate engines being with us here the whole time providing all the secrets and yeah it makes a solution looks less dumb right yeah yeah yeah well look at this too i'm gonna fire them off the show who gave them access to this youtube channel we're revoking we're changing the password yeah next thing you know i have to i have to ask the password every time i'm here yeah oh man
Artem Taranov: all of a sudden the qualifiers are no longer in florida and new jersey either do it on travis okay so main final match we have jerry catarat and george zetkov yeah uh i've heard for for many people that tell me yeah tell me about georgie
Artem Taranov: Well, I've heard that Georgi might have a problem with that lane over Jerry's. That's not the best matchup for Georgi, right? He's kind of a... Is that inside information? Because a lot of people are saying that. It's more like...
Artem Taranov: commentary and some inside information when i hear from like bulgarians themselves it seems like but i guess so as far as the match goes it's not in his favor but power wise you know we don't know power wise we do know that georgie is competing he's active he's uh winning worlds he you know
Artem Taranov: He's in a good shape. So we're going to see if the power lane will align. But according to, you know, bigger dudes and from seeing the stylistically, Jerry is the favorite here. Yeah. I mean, I feel like it's Jerry's such a tricky style that it makes it hard to make Jerry a clear favorite because that lane is so weird. You know what I mean?
Paul Linn: So, like, you could have a guy that has accolades that has done so much more, you know, but yet that lane is just so weird. So us understanding that lane, we're taking that and saying, OK, Jerry's the favorite. But like, who's the more decorated arm wrestler? Who's the more current in the moment? I don't know. It's hard not to say he's not like more established in the current moment. But I think knowing what we know and knowing how tricky that lane is for so many arm wrestlers,
Paul Linn: Yeah, I have Jerry as the favorite too, but it's hard for me to really make him the favorite. Like, I think he's going to win, but I don't think that on paper he is. Like, when you look at, like, common opponents, you don't take into style. Like, take into account style, like so many people do. Like, puller A beats puller C and B, you know, and you have that weird thing and you just assume because this person beat that person that they can beat the other person that they beat.
Paul Linn: that is not the case with a guy like jerry and that's where rankings and things like that gets so weird and hairy he poses a stylistic problem for certain pullers who may be quote unquote at a higher level so yeah i mean i i think jerry's gonna win as long as he's healthy and he's he's over the injury yet okay well yeah i agree as long as he ordered an injury
Artem Taranov: we see the healthy version of him and that style yeah i mean we'll have i will have to see pretty crazy match i'm assuming and people in comments reassuring us that georgie knows his disadvantages and he will come correct and he will not go for the pure top roll that you know you can't go that go into your quarter so that's good i mean yeah but but who are you who are you using at practice to emulate jerry well well i don't
Paul Linn: yeah we all know like don't over rotate like we all know like somebody can give you simple instructions against gary and say don't over rotate and don't expose your arm but like it's easier said than done until you like well it's not necessarily i guess at this point about as a
Artem Taranov: really having the somebody to practice this knowing the plan right knowing to make sure you're not going for the pure top role but plus your is built it's pretty interesting right he has a big forearm big biceps he you know if he's going inside he might be able to have enough meat on him to block jerry's press too yeah it has to be wrist to wrist you gotta have the balls to go in there with him
Artem Taranov: has the balls you have to have the size and you have the size so yeah that's where it gets interesting man that's where it's so hard to be like all right jerry's the favorite you know yeah i see what you say yeah for sure but uh if i guess we're all speaking from general like stylistically boy perspective right if style or style
Artem Taranov: technically yes but that's where we're gonna see if georgie is a well arm wrestler meaning can he adjust and if he can and he's a good arm master then you're gonna see how much power he has so those adjustments as well right so and able to you know go through the angles that he is required to when pulling somebody weird like jerry so
Artem Taranov: all see i'm um and you're right like jerry is a weird one to to go against right like i've practiced jerry once and uh obviously everybody is silly because everybody thinks they can just beat him right because like oh it's jerry you know it's practice you know yeah the wrist always goes but like yeah it's a little different in the tournament but
Artem Taranov: yeah it's four grams long right you think you got the top roll but you'll run out of the pad and he's doing it like that you know the wrist is just about to go and you already have no room so it's kind of it's a tough one to deal with so um well assuming georgie is able to switch up the styles and do something different i we can go with jerry three two one
Artem Taranov: yeah i i like jerry at three three one or three two because jerry will find to make he'll find a way to make it interesting one way or another it'll be a war it'll be a great finishing match for sure yeah and he comes in a great shape and georgia happens to smash him it's great you know what i mean absolutely so uh i'm excited i'm actually a great card so anything you want to say paul i know we took a lot of your time today before
Artem Taranov: it's good it's good okay we we need to we need to outro this thing maybe we can cut this and put it up front maybe give give it we didn't really introduce the channel ask for subscriptions and do all that all right well hey guys if you made it all the way through y'all being at east versus west our message channel please make sure like and subscribe it's uh we have paul here as a guest paul's link to his channel is under your description

Artem Taranov: right hey before we go there has been a uh request for honest opinion of uh and i'm not sure how you've been following and so i've been following i just did a video on my channel about it um with uh
Paul Linn: with uh pradeep um so yeah i did follow the i did follow that zaur right now to me is the most interesting prospect for levon um it doesn't mean that i think that he is ready to defeat him it to me stylistically stature wise skill set wise like genetic wise he poses the most interesting opportunity i do think that we need to see him compete in at least one super match one-on-one
Paul Linn: but i feel like zaur right now is a more interesting matchup for levon um than our mises personally just based off of what i saw at the amc tournament total dominance
Artem Taranov: but okay i'll go a little deeper because i've been following zora since about 2014 probably 2015 when he just first was competing and starting to beat everybody overall said anna's tournament the mosque tournament that were happening in russia and means that would happen to be from the same home state as well we were from region uh so i have a little homie feeling right so
Artem Taranov: Uh,
Artem Taranov: i've been i've been a follower so now it's actually i've been probably i mean it's i'm actually not gonna say what i was gonna say but i like i do knew i knew about him early on and it's cool to see him actually pop off right now to everybody hey like you know they were like yeah i knew it was over before everybody else you know or like it's cool to see him pop off and be the guy and he does look like the guy you know how everybody's like oh that's the guy that's not like who sees the work
Artem Taranov: uh coming to the tournaments bringing that shape even though his problems did have covered before this amc tournament right and he still came and crushed right so that's interesting to see all of that and he we don't really know how well he can match up with the one but it's clearly that he's probably the guy to get that shot
Paul Linn: Right. Yeah, I agree. I agree. It's going to be really interesting, especially when these guys are able to compete in West versus West in the coming months here. So we'll see if they're able to compete in the matchup. It'll be super exciting and hopefully we'll see him at the table somewhere here.
Artem Taranov: I got to go to the bathroom, so I'm going to go ahead and let's close this out. Like, subscribe, and share. Thank you, Ertem, for having me on. Thank you, Paul, for being here.
