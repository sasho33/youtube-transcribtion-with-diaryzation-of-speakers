Engin Terzi: Hello, Engine Turbo. Hello, Victor. These guys are forever, forever fans. Let me check what... Yep. Okay, Leonardo Torres.
Engin Terzi: Hello, hello, hello. Engin Terzius, phone charger. Pulseo TV. Hello, guys. Alvaro Laguna. Hello. Levan Rexviyashvili. Uya Gagnidze. Hello, guys. Hello. Mason. Hello. Dylan Lemonlime. Hello, guys. Woodsman.
Engin Terzi: Hello. Good morning to you. Good evening to me. Arm Wrestling Emiliano. Hello, my friend Benji. Hello, my friends. Yep. Guys, if anyone can share our, we have trading cards. Can you share? Do you know the link, Benji? Maybe I can also, but anyways, Joe Kennedy. Hello. Hello.
Engin Terzi: You're welcome. And thank you. Thank you for supporting. Thank you for watching. Thank you guys. And hello. Today we will have today we will have special special guests. Sorry, my friend, I cannot read what we wrote. It's probably
Engin Terzi: russian but i don't know what it means and ethics hello hello my friends um yeah today we will have rustam in my opinion is like one of the greatest
Engin Terzi: pullers of all time easily in either top five or top seven, you know. Yeah. Who will Pablo pull? I don't know. There is no match set for him. We have 16 matches. We will talk about them. Alvaro Laguna, Pablo is in incredible shape. Yes. Joe Kennedy, Engin, do you know if Rustam has been active or inactive? I think he had been inactive, but
Engin Terzi: plus probably for five months he started to train. And you know, when you are, I mean, 20 years at the top of the game, to come back, I mean, as long as you don't wait for like five years, 10 years, to come back is not, it doesn't take so long time, you know. Yes, Rustam is great. Rustam is one of the greatest
Engin Terzi: of all time is a legend, no doubt. And his opponent, Pauline, he started armwrestling late, but he's just killing it lately. He's coming to here overseas and, I mean, he's doing great. And the way that he beat Irakli Gamtenadze was impressive, impressive. And we will see, we will see.
Engin Terzi: Alvaro says, yeah, Rustam moved to UK recently in training with club. Was that torture? Yeah. Yeah, I know he's England. I didn't know which club he's training. Um... Um...
Engin Terzi: We don't know, we don't know if Michael cannot cook anyone at 105 kilo, my friend. All those, all those rates are for people's own category. But just for your information, even before he went up, for example, in 100 kilo, he was the second in the world in 2002 to waft in Illinois.
Engin Terzi: So maybe you make your own cars and you do do your own ratings and then you try to sell them. Anyways, so we are waiting our guests to come. They have four minutes. Were you surprised that Bristol lost to Tim Bresnan in top eight? No, no, Dusty. I wasn't surprised because talking about
Engin Terzi: one guy, normally he walks around 95 kilo against a super heavyweight. So I don't think it is any surprise. Yeah, Ruslan Bobo is for his weight category. He used to dominate everyone. Thank you. There will be more cars. And interestingly, we will have
Engin Terzi: All those 30 guys who are competing West versus West six events, we will have their cards. Everyone will sign their own cards. Also, we will have, most likely we will have a wooden box for them. It will look very special. And Denis Splenko will have his card too. But we will put Denis Splenko's prime shape card into that, and he will also sign his card.
Engin Terzi: No, Levan, you're always right. I'm a newbie, you know. I just started. Yeah. Yeah, Pauline came.
Engin Terzi: very cool idea with the cars i showed to devon larat and neil pick up uh my rates for uh dennis's prime time you know uh rates and he said they said like um devon said dennis is one of the smartest guys he said that he probably didn't pull anyone smarter than or
Engin Terzi: it may not be generally but in that event he said that dennis was super smart you know and then whenever i talk with neil pickup neil pickup said that uh maybe his speed rating should be lower than what i was thinking this is but instead the rest of them um they agree with me um i'm i'm focused on uh
Engin Terzi: my event chance show is pulling uh david arabuli on january 21st we'll talk about another event a month later it's kind of disrespect on this program i don't know if that's your intention or not um yeah wouldn't brian yes wouldn't by the way hello hello hello paul how are you my friend good hanging how you doing good good good good i was just chatting
Engin Terzi: with our brothers in armwrestling. Brian, wooden box for the cars. Yes, my friend, we want everything to be top notch. You know, we want, because armwrestling deserves. We are not anymore the orphan of the world sports. Yeah, we are not. We will prove them. Hello, Todd and Oleg's love child.
Engin Terzi: And you really the same manufacturer as poster because poster is very high quality. Yes, it will be we will be picked them the highest quality and plastic cards. And then the printing everything will be super good. He will not be getting out the color, color will be I made sure I talked with the guy, the most expensive ones we are making, you know, and I'm

Engin Terzi: You remember me from Hungary, Europeans 1999? Yes, yes, remember. At that time you were junior, junior, right? Junior 65. Junior 65, yeah. Oh, but you competed senior as well? Senior 2001. No, no, no, no. In Hungary, did you compete senior? Ah, no, no, no, senior. Oh, okay.

Engin Terzi: From 1999, I do final match, you are at the side, you watch it. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes. I remember. And how is your shape? Good? Your power, good? Good, good, good. What percentage? But different preparation. I don't know how. How good you are?
Rustam Babayev: how wrestling in start how start oh okay and hello paulo hello how are you good good good you know you know rustam right yes i know rustam
Paolo: Paolo is from the same town as Oleg Dzhok. Oleg Dzhok. I'm from Rovno. Oleg is also from Rovno, but not far from Rovno. Okay, we'll be friends. We saw each other at Zlotn recently, not so long ago, in 2019. Were you with Borodoy?
Engin Terzi: yeah okay can you can you tell uh rustem that i i want to tell him that probably he understand anyways his english is much better than last time but still you can translate you will understand perfectly uh that we started to doing this east versus west and looks like you know people enjoys in the community and to
Engin Terzi: Rustam says that when they started ISV, it turned out that everyone loves him very much.
Paolo: He says it's a shame that one of the best armwrestlers of all time, that is, you, wasn't there, and you weren't enough. And he says, well, now everything will be fine. It's nice to hear. It's nice that you haven't forgotten for so long. It's my pleasure. I'm glad that you did not forget me yet. No, no, never, never, never. There are a few guys, John Brzenk, Zolev Hajimrat, Rustam Babayev,
Engin Terzi: Zubatan Gashevsky, Dave Patton, Cobra Rose, this, I never forget, you know, this. Can you, can you tell him, like he, I asked him, but he understood my question, but he was having a hard time to express himself. What is his shape right now? And, and then like,
Paolo: Can he give us a percentage? How is his training going? How long he has been training? Well, I will say that the preparation is going in a completely different way.
Rustam Babayev: Everything has changed. It's not the same as it was before. It turns out that I train in different gyms, in different gyms. And it turns out that I got 100% better at certain exercises. Not even worse than it was. A couple of percent, maybe even higher.
Rustam Babayev: I haven't done any exercises yet. I still have to go out for a couple of weeks. I'm doing everything on a regular basis. Maybe it's even for the better. We'll see. Who knows. Other opponents are working differently. I want to see how it will be. If necessary, I want to make some adjustments.
Paolo: uh okay he said that uh preparation is going pretty good and uh he's gaining their form in some of the it's a little different because he's different he's using a different equipment now in a different gym uh because of the situation uh in Ukraine and uh different sparring partners
Paolo: But he said in some of the exercises he's at 100%. Some of them even exceed 100%. Some of them need some corrections. But he said, you know, this match will show him where he needs to put some corrections and what the actual form is. No matter if he wins or loses? That I did not ask, but I can.
Paolo: He doesn't even think about losing. This mindset is winning.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah no what i'm just saying that i understand that but you always learn but sometimes we learn more when we lose we lose we learn less when we win but that's i didn't mean that you know but you know paul is here as well you know he's probably thinking the opposite way is there any way on your mind paul what's your mindset paul
Paul Linn: I mean, the same mindset that I come in with any match. Obviously, the ultimate goal is to come in and have success. But when you get the opportunity to arm wrestle somebody of Bruce Dom's status and caliber, the experience itself is success in itself. So obviously, I'm training and preparing with the intention of having success.
Paolo: but i'm just grateful to be on the stage against such a high caliber athlete and a great person uh
Paolo: Thank you.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so what I'm just thinking, many people are, they are thinking that, like, for example, when Paul pulled against Gamtenadze, personally, I expected a closer match. I didn't expect that domination. But Paul really dominated him. And whenever I asked Gamtenadze, he said he is in the best shape of his life. So
Engin Terzi: when rustam is not training where he used to train and he had some off time of years even but he's probably my guess is he's training for five months you know and so he thinks that there is like on his mind he said that he doesn't even think that is it is any chance to lose but you see um like
Engin Terzi: Some people are thinking that because he's not in really prime, like, for example, Zurab Tavberidze said that Paul is going to beat Rustam. And what does he think about these opinions? Okay, let me try.
Paolo: Some people think that because you took such a break in armwrestling, and Engin thinks that you have been training for only about 5 months since the moment you started coming back. For example, Zurab Tavberidze even believes that Paul can win from you. How do you perceive such comments?
Paolo: Do you think that there is such an opportunity, because you had such a break, that Paul can win? Because Paul won from Tamburinze with such a big margin, and he said that he was in his... Camtenazza or Tamburinze? Camtenazza, I'm sorry. Camtenazza, yes. And he said that he was in the best shape of his life.
Rustam Babayev: Well, of course, it can be anything. I haven't performed for a long time myself. But we are all people. You can get sick tomorrow and lose your form. It's a clear thing. But, in principle, I think that judging by the way I fight there, I look at the opponents who are here, I understand that they are lower level than they were where I trained before.
Rustam Babayev: Well, in general, I look at the form on the iron. The form is normal, but as I said, I made a statement at the beginning that I want to look at it from the outside, because I haven't had such a situation before. Naturally, I don't tune in to the negative,
Rustam Babayev: There are opponents who are uncomfortable and comfortable. There are a lot of factors that can play in any direction. Therefore, since I have already performed so much and I know all this, I understand what I need to prepare for, what options there may be and how to change my actions along the way.
Rustam Babayev: not only at the table, but also in the training process. I look where it is better to recover, where it is better to slow down. I want to roll it all up. In this case, where I am and see the difference in preparation and what the result will be.
Paolo: Okay, let me try to translate. So basically Rustam is saying the life is life, but based on his experience,
Paolo: uh previous experience he been uh there are so many times that he knows the process and how to make adjustments uh he knows how to train uh to prepare for exact opponent let's say and where to make an accent uh he said by the lifting weights he sees that he is in a good shape very close to what he were before
Paolo: uh it's a different it's a different spying partners where he training right now and they are uh a couple levels below from the partners he used to have but uh anyway it's uh some of the signs that he's in a good shape and he said listen uh we will see he said mindset is that it should go fine but yes you're right there was a break and who knows we will see
Rustam Babayev: And what does he think about his opponent? What do you think about your opponent, Paul Linn? To be honest, I watched his videos where he fought. In general, not bad physically. Technically, I see his mistakes, I understand it all, because I have enough experience.
Rustam Babayev: New generation, young, strong. We'll try to figure it out along the way. Do you know how old you are? Up to 30, I guess. 41. Really? I didn't even know that. I mean young, not in terms of age. I got it. Fresh athletes. I'll translate it, yes.
Paolo: uh first of all it's a little funny uh russam did not know how old paul is and he felt under 30 so i make a correction everybody knows everything now uh yeah he said that uh he been looking at your videos and you're physically very strong and uh as an arm wrestler you're good arm wrestler but you're still making some mistakes and he's seeing them
Paolo: and uh based on his big experience you know he he may analyze them and uh use them against you so he's been watching you and it's uh very respectful i think uh so and he said that young generation you know it's a stronger generation i'm like hold on a second and he make a correction uh that's probably probably the same age maybe paul is one year older
Paolo: Paul is a little bit older, probably three years. How old is he? He's 42. He's 82, 40, and Paul is 41. Yeah, one year.
Paolo: uh so he says young generation i'm like hold on do you know how old he is he's like okay we make a correction they're fresh athletes he said okay so yeah but he's that's that's what he said he's watching you and uh he said it's nice what you're doing in your form and physique is very good thank you yeah paul this is so good that in a very respectful way but in a very honest way he is saying that in his own because we asked him
Engin Terzi: think that of course this is how he thinks you know he is very experienced and then of course that is the way that he's gonna attack he's gonna attack where you where he thinks that you are making a mistake and then he's gonna use this against you but as always the last word is said by power you know that's what it is and but you have been analyzing rustam as well absolutely absolutely yeah yeah what do you think about him that not only like how great he is
Engin Terzi: Because we don't need to talk about this guy is one of the greatest arm masters. But how do you see when you analyze him? How do you see that technically, you know, or just like speed, explosiveness, hand control, his abilities to pull in different ways? What's your analysis about him?
Paul Linn: I think the most impressive thing about Rustam is the physical stature and, you know, hand size, his ability to overcome all these things and pull at such a high level in open weight categories without all the genetic gifts that the larger people have. So going through previous matches, I've seen multiple different setups, multiple different adjustments. He's fast. He has endurance. He has just about everything.
Paul Linn: except for all those super crazy physical numbers like you know thatcher so for him to be able to the rest of the world is lucky that he's not built like that oh my goodness yeah are you kidding me if somebody can compete at his weight in top eight you know and have the success that he has had yeah yeah imagine if he was 190 and 120 kilo rooster he would be wow huh
Paul Linn: you're good you're good i mean he's unbelievable i've seen multiple different setups through different matches against different opponents um so his ability to analyze and adjust is i mean he's great for a reason yeah so did you find the edge do you know do you have a plan how to win i mean i have i have options i had a plan against you too pablo
Paolo: Paolo, you are lucky that I was not at his corner that night, that day. I know, I know, dude, I know. Okay, let me translate for Rustam a little bit, because we're talking like, you know. Rustam, yes. Well, he was also asked what he thinks about you. Well, Engin says, just like that. He says, stop praising, we know everything. You say, like, what to do, how to win. Well, it didn't work out. He said yes.
Paolo: He says that all the equipment is available, and despite the fact that the physique is awesome, he says that the length of the arm, the height, the weight, he says that he can fight with super heavyweights, with any sportsman, he finds ways to fight. He says, well, respect, but I interrupted him, I say, in short, come on, come up with how to beat him.
Paolo: He, well, of course, deviated a little from the answer. He says, listen, well, there is a plan, of course. And we recently fought him at Monster Factory. I had a super match with him. Well, I won. He says, well, I had a plan against you too. Well, it didn't work out. Well, in general, yes, we laughed a little bit. So, well, he, yes, respect to you and all that stuff, yes. Well, he's planning something there.
Paolo: he said that uh yeah paul a lot of respect to you too and he very respectful to the uh uh sportsmen who can win and who can properly lose because i told him the situation i translated everything basically okay yeah somebody wrote here that uh
Engin Terzi: Paul was 240 at the Monster Factory. He's going down. No, as far as I remember, Paul said he was 227. Is that correct, Paul? 227 force feeding. Yeah, 227. Yeah, as I said, you know, 227 he was. So he's not going down from 240. And I'm sure that even 227, he was not even dieting. Were you? I don't know. I was eating as much as I could. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so, yeah.
Engin Terzi: that's that's incredible yeah i can say that two of the uh most uh respectful guys and doesn't talk a lot of but goes to table and do all the work there it's it's incredible yeah yeah and then can i can i translate you very fast to rostam and ask him what his weight and the what the plants weight wise he said 97 98 but you can ask him again okay
Paolo: Rustam, yes, well, they talked about how much Paul weighed in our match, and he was 227 pounds, which means about 103 kilograms, it turns out. But he ate, scored specifically for me, because I am heavier, I was 110. Well, a question to you, how much do you weigh and what is the plan? Well, I weigh 98 plus or minus a kilogram, in general.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he said, yeah, you're right. It was 97, 98 kilos. Gained strength and yeah, dropped a little bit. I didn't hear, I'm sorry. No, no, no, not here. I personally asked him by private message. I said, do you want to stick with 95 or do you want to pull sometimes 95, sometimes 105?
Engin Terzi: He said, I'm like 97, 98 without diet and eating everything. So he said that he would like to be at 95 kilogram category. Yeah. Rustam, you know, this is for the West versus West professional world title. You know, right? He said, you know, this is for the West versus West professional world title.
Paolo: Yeah. And Rustam, what is the percentage of you putting the helmet and holding the shield? He says, how many percent that you will wear this shield and helmet? Percentage? I have to fight. I haven't fought since 2019, since the end.
Paolo: Yeah, he said that, you know, I didn't pull since 2019. And he said, Well, we'll see. But you know, I'm coming to win and say 100%. Yeah, I mean, both since both of them are very respectful guys. I am
Paolo: like doing also in a respectful way to provocate them. You understand? Yeah. I know. I know you. Yeah. The first couple of podcasts when I was supposed to translate this provocation, I'm like, Oh my God. And I have to translate it properly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But now, yeah. And Paul, you came here twice.
Engin Terzi: both times you had opponent from georgia first david samushia second iraqi but this guy is different level you know it but finally you have the possibility you know opportunity to reach that helmet and shield you know like whenever whenever you come and watch the event
Engin Terzi: Like you ever thought that, you know, I'm going to put that on me someday or? No, I mean, we all have hopes and dreams, but I mean, long term goal. David you ever feel like, did you ever want to put that on you in the future? David you like when you saw?
Paul Linn: And, you know, it's funny when I first started arm wrestling, I found arm wrestling and, you know, I got a good group of buddies from college and everything. And and they were like, I remember right when I started getting I want to go to go to a tournament. And my one buddy said to me, like, well, what is your goals? Like, I think you could be pretty good, like maybe in Pennsylvania, but like national champion, like be realistic, you know, world champion, be realistic, you know. And I remember thinking to myself, like, I'll show you.
Engin Terzi: Nobody can limit our goals or dreams. Never. People call you delusional or something. Who cares? We all once called delusional when we had big dreams, when I was getting beat by my mother and my sister. And I said, I'm going to become world champion. Yeah, they call me delusional too, but I did many times. So go ahead. Yeah, it's motivation. And you fast forward six years.
Paul Linn: Like there was no, there was no point in my mind starting off where I was even thinking about anything like this.
Paul Linn: But in the back of my head, it's long-term goals. So, you know, with every step along the way, those goals became a little bit more realistic. So, again, I'm just blessed to be here six short years. And at age 41, I'm just happy to get the opportunity against another legend. So, as far as percentages and things like that, I give myself a low percentage. But I wouldn't want it any other way. I just need that one percent, that puncher's chance.
Engin Terzi: I just need the Rocky Barbora. That's it. Yeah. But you are not intimidated, right? No. I've been around. That's the most important part. I've been around. I remember in 2001, I went there. I didn't know that Dave Patton was there. And I asked Cobra, what do you think? I mean, I can beat him or something? He said, you're going to beat him. He said, just don't be intimidated. Don't be like, oh, he's great or something. I said, no, I'm not intimidated.
Engin Terzi: So as long as you are not intimidated, then there is a possibility to win.
Paul Linn: At the end of the day, as much of my energy and my emotion that I put into the sport, it's still just arm wrestling. What's the worst that can happen? If you're afraid of losing, you're limiting yourself, your opportunities to win. So I'm not afraid of losing. I'm not afraid of an opponent. I mean, what's the worst can happen? Maybe an arm break or an injury. We'll heal from that. So no intimidation, more just gratefulness for the opportunity. But I will tell you something.
Engin Terzi: I will tell you something, there are a lot of people, they stay in their country and they call the competition. I'm not talking about, I'm not pointing fingers, but there are people like that they will know themselves. They organize world championships in their country. I'm talking about PES and only they compete their country and they call themselves world champions. You understand? And whenever there is something big,
Engin Terzi: They don't come, they like to sit at home, say that, hey, I'm world champion, I'm this, I'm this. I respect these people. I mean, in fact, I respect people who comes to win the toughest event, win or not, just say it took fifth place. I respect this person more than those others who choose some events easy and pretend like they are the best.
Engin Terzi: they never step up where they were the greatest where the strongest are so this i don't say i don't this i i don't respect them but people who are i mean you will never be the best if you are afraid to step up against the best you know so that is the thing you know i mean like you are just satisfying yourself you understand that where you are you know what i mean i'm not going to use that word but you know what you mean you know what i mean yeah so the more
Paul Linn: The more intimidating thing to me is a really hungry underdog or a guy that's not supposed to beat you or a small tournament that you're supposed to win. I'd much rather go against someone I'm supposed to lose to and learn along the way. Because you like to prove something. You like to prove. You like to prove people that you can do it. When everyone says you're going to win, you're going to win, you're going to win, you are like, how can I be motivated? Anyways, rush them.
Paolo: David you watch any of these West vs. West events? Have you watched them? Have you been following them? Engin, give me one second, I'll tell Rustam approximately what you've been talking about. Okay, probably I understand.
Paolo: Rustam, did you understand what they were saying or tell you a little bit? Well, I didn't understand a little bit. Yes, well, they mostly talked about, well, asked Paul, he says, you won twice at West vs West, now you have the opportunity to fight with a different caliber of athletes, how do you feel, or are you a little scared, are you very worried? He says, listen, I go out like an underdog, well, like a
Paolo: The second number says, well, listen, I only need one percent, I need a chance. He says, will I take advantage of this chance or not, we'll see. Well, in short, it was such a pleasant conversation, you know, like Engin later told about people who always fight there only in their own region, never go anywhere, win small competitions in comparison with those who are trying to achieve something, go to big competitions, well, such a conversation, you know, such a normal one.
Paolo: I like him as an athlete, I respect him. I'll tell you myself, he's a cool guy. And then he asked you whether you follow the ISCS West, or you watch it on pay-per-view, or how it turns out, or you watched all these events.
Rustam Babayev: Some of them have been able to watch live and pay-per-view, but if not, they've been watching
Engin Terzi: majority of the matches afterwards uh yeah he likes it very much and he said please be healthy uh be successful and please grow up it's very good i i want all of us to grow up you know these guys superstars you know everyone would know everyone should know you know these are i mean i'm i understand that you know there are other sports other superstars but these are
Engin Terzi: are superstars for me just say sorry but just rustam baba john burzing for me more superstar than ronaldo messi i understand for their sport they are but this is our sport for me this is the messi this is the ronaldo you understand rustam is there john is there just say i mean levan is there when when after paul beats rustam and then paul will be there you know i'm joking
Paolo: He talks about superstars in different sports. For them, Ronaldo is their own superstar. For us, it's our sport, and we have our own superstars, such as Kostan, such as Levan, such as Can Brzenk.
Paolo: By the way, Paul, if you grow a little bit more, you will be like Ninja Turtles, my friend. Your trapeze and everything soon will be ahead of your, you know. I just came from the gym. I was shrugging, you know.
Engin Terzi: Pablo said, stop struggling with straps. So I had to do it. Yeah. I love my community. Again, these are our heroes. And I'm happy to serve our community. I hope I grow. The more I grow, the more I serve them. The more I serve them. I passed my prime, everything. I cannot train so many injuries. But at least I can do something else for the sport.
Engin Terzi: um so he said that he has been watching and he likes it yeah that's good i'm happy um because there are i mean i i respect everybody's opinion but but for this kind of people's opinion weighs a little bit heavier than you know some others you know and um so rushtem did you have a chance to check the other matches did you look at the other matches on the card
Paolo: He said that he read them all. Maybe he does not remember them all on top of his head, but he said it's a lot of very interesting matches there. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: and probably he will not know some of them because a lot of people from west at the beginning especially didn't know about the colors from the east as as long as it's not like superstars and a lot of people from east didn't know the western pullers so maybe he wouldn't know some of them but let's start like for example how do you see i think yesterday you were you were talking but here i will also ask your opinion too paulo
Engin Terzi: My friend, you are not, you are not only translated here, you know, so I know it is the truth, you know, and that they like, um, but, but Douglas are rich versus, uh, right. Most of the. Uh,
Paolo: So, Engin, I'm sorry, the first one was Douglas. How do you say Doug Erlich, Paul? Doug Erlich, Doug Erlich. Yeah, he told me, in fact, Erlich, Erlich.
Engin Terzi: He said it's like that. But yeah, yeah. But Doug, Doug Erlich versus Raimonds Lepkins. Florida. OK, let's do it this way. The ones that you don't know, you don't give your opinion. Even, you know, one of the guys, if you don't know the other guy, how can you compare them? Yeah. So let's go. This one I will only ask to Pauline. So I think I think coach, I think Coach Ray is the favorite.
Paul Linn: um but i think doug has a serious puncher's chance and i'll be rooting for doug i'm going on january 7th i'm going to fly down to florida i'm going to train with doug and craig touye and justin bishop yeah good good team west like we're going to try and get chance there too yeah see if we can build up
Paul Linn: So I think Doug's in good form. It's a similar scenario to Rustam. Doug competed about a similar previous time, like 2017 or 18. So he's had a layoff too, which makes it really interesting about his form. But I have a feeling he's going to come in really, really top notch. This is a big deal for Doug. I think that gives him a little bit of an edge.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he just sent me a message I saw at the corner. I couldn't answer because I'm on a live show. He said that his passport will be ready on Friday. He's so happy. Yeah, yeah. And pork chop versus rap. Let's start with you, Paolo. With me? Yeah. And then you can ask Rustam after that if he knows pork chop. OK. OK. Yeah. I think that pork chop has a slight edge.
Paolo: on the uh power and leverage and uh possibly even on the sneakiest and uh knowledge because of devon of his training partner and uh yeah uh if if if zurab will be able to hook him deep deep close to him then zurab but if not if he will prevent it from that if porkchop will prevent zurab from doing that
Engin Terzi: he will win so i would say like 60 40 for portrait because you are saying that workshop probably will get the advantage and then we'll put zura out of position with this yeah yeah i see it probably 60 40 the other way um and i'm only going off of zurab's experience
Paul Linn: You know, and the lack of data that we really have, uh, one poor job against like international opponents.
Paul Linn: So I'm rooting for Portchop. I'm rooting for Curtis. I'd like to see him win, you know, Team West and everything. But I feel like Zurab's like activity level and the fact that I don't think Curtis has a whole lot of outside options. Pablo makes a good point about Devin being his training partner, not being an advantage. I got to agree with that. But my gut just tells me that Zurab is going to come in in his usual form.
Engin Terzi: uh but in any case would be a huge a huge test for workshop and i would love to see nothing more than him to get the win and kind of emerge as another north american guy do you guys think that do you guys think that i should make a big trophy because some of the matches are east versus west some of east is by counting only the matches as east versus west the ones that
Engin Terzi: And then at the end, you know, the one who has the most wins, if it is equal, the wins, and then we can count the rounds. And at the end, they go to the stage and they are like with the trophy. I say absolutely yes. Absolutely yes. That would make it so much more cool. But then I'm really into that team thing personally. So I don't know if everybody else would be as excited as me. Yeah. No, I see that. I see that more and more. More of you guys come here.
Engin Terzi: Can you ask Rustam if he knows who Porkchop is? Rustam, do you know Porkchop, Canadian Curtis? No, I don't know. Okay, does he know Corey West? Do you know Corey West? No, I don't know many of them.
Rustam Babayev: Let me ask him time to time. Let me ask one match that he would know them. Ferit Osmanli, Genadi Kvikvinia. What do you think about this match? Ferit Osmanli, Genadi Kvikvinia.
Rustam Babayev: Is it good match? Good match. Good match. Interesting. Very interesting. Yeah. And who is winning? Who is winning? Winner. Who better preparation. Okay. Yeah. And you can say in Ukrainian if it is easier for you. Your opinion.
Rustam Babayev: He's saying that they both have approximately the same, but the winner will be the one who is
Paolo: taking this supermatch more serious and will bring the most prepared form. Yeah, because he's saying that both have a chance to win, but their shape from that day will determine the winner because both can win. Okay. Exactly. In your opinion, Paolo? I would agree with Rustam exactly. Yeah. It all depends on preparation. And Paul? I think it...
Paul Linn: i think it's really close to it's a tough one to pick for sure um i i would think that gannatti's preparation being that all he's really doing right now is east versus west that he's training and peaking for these and these only i think that gives him a play edge plus i love him i like the georgians so i gotta root for him for gannatti but i think it's close yeah i mean if your first two matches
Engin Terzi: against georgians were like lost then then it probably would you wouldn't be feeling the same i'm joking i like it i like them yeah anyways rustam uh another one that you would know mindaugas tarasaitis do you know this year 75 kilo waff winner the kazakh guy you don't know right you remember yeah
Rustam Babayev: I can't say for sure because he doesn't know their strength and power and he does not really follow them. And your opinion? Paolo, do you know them? Yes, Tarasaitis will win. And Paul?
Paul Linn: I think Nordelet's the favorite. I think it's probably 60-40 Nordelet, but I've just been so impressed by Mindaugas as far as his composure, the little things that he does mentally, and his setup game, I thought, was really, really impressive. I think that that's an edge for him, but I think he does come into the match a slight underdog. Yeah, yeah. The guys are saying that Ferit beating Genadi
Engin Terzi: would make the rankings even more confusing ah guys just just wait for the april event that is all i will say just wait for the apple event and then then yeah you will probably thank me anyway so no more i'm not gonna say anything more uh obviously this one this one rustam would know petrenko versus alicia murado
Engin Terzi: Muratov, I don't know who it is. Don't tell me you don't know Muratov. Muratov, he was 95 kilos. He won the super heavyweight. Wow. The Kazakh guy. From Kazakhstan. Muratov, you don't know? Alizhan. Alizhan. Alizhan Muratov, now he doesn't know him. Rustam.
Engin Terzi: You did not leave the sport only physically, you left the sport mentally too. Come back, come back, Rustam, come back. Yeah, he's coming, he's coming back. Alizhan is 95 kilos. This year he competed in WAF, super heavyweight. Easy win, gold medal.
Rustam Babayev: Alizhan won, he's a 95-kilo guy, and Vav won super heavyweight, left hand, easily. Ah, Alizhan, I got it. I know what it is. It will be interesting, yes, Petrenko, in general. I think if speed, speed always has an advantage, that's what I'll say. You were saying that the speed,
Engin Terzi: having always a big advantage so uh yeah petrenko is slow you know i mean not fast yeah and so we will see we will see and how do you know this all i mean i know i know uh just kind of what uh artem and i talked about and you corrected us in the comments uh but i think you watch him did you watch his performance
Paul Linn: I watched a little bit after the last live that we did, and what he's doing with that weight, left arm, is incredible. So, I mean, part of, like, I'm rooting for Oleg because, you know, he's such a nice guy. But after seeing what I saw, I think he has to be, I mean, he has to be an underdog. Very good matches, very good matches. Okay, Rustam. I don't know. Michael Todd and Ongar Babayev. Rustam.
Rustam Babayev: I think Michael Todd and Ongarbaev will be uncomfortable. Not the same category at all. 105 kg. They will both weigh 105 kg. They will both weigh 105 kg. Michael Todd goes down to 105 kg. How much did he weigh? 120 kg. Well, even more than 125 kg.
Paolo: no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Paul Linn: But both in the same category, Ongarbaev. Okay. Yes, yes. Okay. And how do you see that match, Paul? I think with all the unknown variables around Michael, meaning the bicep injury, the big weight cut, I think he has to come in as the underdog. I think Ongarbaev's style, back pressure, top knuckle, you know, stylistically, too, it creates a problem. But I believe in Michael's heart. If he can get a stop,
Engin Terzi: in any of the first three rounds i think he pulls it off yeah but just remember even when you stop on that way you remember alex kurdecha and on guardway alex took and on guardway was still able to win this guy can also pull in any position so even the match stop i will i won't be sure about who is winning that yeah yeah i think i think hunger buy is the favorite but um i'm i'm picking michael yeah
Rustam Babayev: Rustam, did you watch Ongarbaev vs Brzenk? Yes, I watched. Was it a surprise for you or normal? Maybe yes, it was a surprise. But you can expect everything from Brzenk now. He's old already.
Paolo: He's saying that, yes, it was a little surprise, but he said in John's age, there is too many factors which can have some impact on his form and his performance. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I'm going to ask you the same question, Paolo, but before that, I'm going to ask Rustam. Rustam, who is the greatest arm master of all time? Rustam, who is the best? Well, the strongest or the best? The best. Brzenk. Brzenk, right? Brzenk, yes.
Engin Terzi: Technique, strength. Berzing, number one. And number two is here. 40 years, Rustam, 40 years. Yes, yes. He is still one of the best.
Rustam Babayev: What? Ever, but he's the best ever. What's that I didn't hear you?
Engin Terzi: You were cut. You're getting cut. Yeah, she said that maybe he's not the strongest ever, but he's the best ever. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a different thing, you know. Talking about 90, 95, 100 kilo guy, you know. Maybe Rustam remembers John Burzing had the PAL super heavyweight title and PAL 95 kilo title. And John, I mean, John had these titles and John was going 86 kilo for Rustam.
Rustam Babayev: The situation was different. The official situation was my fault.
Rustam Babayev: The truth was a little bit different and he said that
Paolo: the match was cancelled because of the other circumstances and right after... This is how Igor told us. This is how Igor told us. Yeah, but officially it was called that match was cancelled because of his injury. And? What was the truth? The truth was that match was cancelled before his injury
Paolo: For different circumstances he didn't say why, but after that he was injured and that was the most comfortable way to present why. I understand, yeah. And they are asking Rustam, who was the strongest armwrestler ever? Who was the strongest armwrestler? I think Levan so far.
Rustam Babayev: So far, Levan. Levan. So, best of Levan, best of Denis. Who wins? Levan is genetically more gifted. His indicators are completely different. For Denis, he would definitely not be comfortable. Denis is strong, Denis is strong, Denis is powerful, but it seems to me that he would not pull Levan anthropometrically. No.
Paolo: okay so he's saying yeah that uh still the one uh because he's uh he's a genetic uh he's he's more genetically gifted than dennis and that's why uh dennis yeah he's powerful he's strong but he is uh genetically not as gifted as the one so then he said that levan is better and and and paulo how do you see on garve and michael
Paolo: uh i think that uh everybody is right and because of the weight cut uh it will uh put uh michael's underdog uh which corner i am in in michael's corner and i want him to win but i think it's uh it will be tough match for him because of the weight cut i understand um
Paolo: Let's talk about some matches. These ones, they wouldn't know. You guys would know. Corey West versus Ferit. Paolo. It's a great matchup. Corey West in constant climbing up. Ferit is standstill. And if Ferit will bring their good form, at least 90-95%, it's going to be a great match. Great match. Because it's power over power.
Engin Terzi: uh if he will be at the forum he brought to amc last time uh then cody west will win yeah i will tell about something night before i called perit okay and yeah he i did a video chat and he and glashevsky were spending the night at the airport because since the war all the flights to russia is very problematic
Engin Terzi: so there was delay postpone and this whatever you know just and then with the languages they were they were sitting on it was after midnight and they were in the airport and they were trying to get rest so uh i think that they had very terrible nights and the guy that won 85 kilo uh one and a half month before the event
Engin Terzi: Gachevsky beat him at Dubai events, and this event he just flashed Gachevsky. I'm not saying he wouldn't flash or something, but the outcome was way too different, you know. So that's what I wanted to say. Sure. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying. It really depends on many factors. International events are hard to participate because of the travel, because of the form, the weight loss or not weight loss.
Paolo: and uh time change and stuff like that it's made it may differ up to probably 10 to 15 percent and that's may make a huge huge impact yeah rushton do you know barbara and barbara versus gabriella who is winning there oh yeah
Rustam Babayev: I don't know. I can't say. I don't follow girls, especially in these categories. I just haven't been able to watch it for a long time. It was not really a possibility to watch and follow everything. He cannot comment on this. He doesn't know. I understand. And do you know anything about Barbora?
Paolo: i don't i follow her uh instagram and i'm i know a little bit uh she she's strong and uh i don't think that her experience will allow her to win with gabriella but it may be a very close match i understand yeah and i think yesterday paul you said you you are favoring uh gabriella
Engin Terzi: yeah so yeah so rustam doesn't know and paula and paul says that gabi wins for me it's 50 50 tingle both ways you know both blues are incredible here and then yeah a while ago chance wrote that uh chance show wrote that probably uh rustam wouldn't know about me either uh rustam do you know chance show
Paolo: Rustam, do you know who is this young American? No, I don't know. He's wearing a Hawaiian shirt. And I have to follow. Chance versus Arabuli. Do you know David Arabuli? You ever heard of him? I heard of him. I don't know. I cannot answer. He was at the Sunday's level. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, but I cannot answer.
Paolo: I want to tell you something that chance show every time I see him, he bringing to the table more and more tools. Yes. He's constantly growing technique wise. And I believe power wise too. And he's, he's in a better shape every time I see him. So I will. Yes, exactly. That's why I cannot answer if you're going to win, but I want to tell you that chance show is climbing that ladder.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, I agree. Yeah, very dangerous shift. And Paul, anything to add?
Paul Linn: I think stylistically from what I've seen and talking to Chance, I think it's going to be very tricky to get Chance in that deep hook lane. I think Chance's hook defense is as good as anybody we have over here. So I think stylistically he's a favorite. And just like Pablo said, he takes these West versus West matches very, very seriously. So he's going to show up in great form. I know he's training and he's getting better. He's still young.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, this is very, very hard to hook him and beat him, you know. Once he has this, I mean, he's so deadly, you know. Yeah. And Corey West versus Arif, Paolo? Yeah, I will give Corey a slight edge here. He's constantly climbing, and that power and size, plus he already has some good experience there,
Paolo: I mean, he's very, very strong, powerful, and deadly. Yeah. I would give him a match. Yeah. And Paul?
Paul Linn: Yeah, Corey's our future. Like, Corey's our future super heavyweights over here. I mean, we got a lot of guys that are on the rise, but Corey's, I think, just ahead above everybody. And again, like Pablo's saying, he's only getting better, you know, and the genetic tools and gifts that he has, the ceiling is so high. I really expect him to come out to West versus West and show his best form with both arms. Yeah. He also asked me to pull both hands.
Engin Terzi: The pullers asked me to pull both hands. I set them and then I get the shit, you know, from people. Why you set them? Yeah, but I will, but I will do, I will put probably, there are 60 matches. I will put about 10 matches between two matches. Last time I couldn't do it because both of those matches were very, really tough matches. Like it was so hard to put Ermes versus Dave Chaffee title match.
Engin Terzi: to the beginning of the event, you understand? Yeah. And if I would use the left arm match first, and then both Hermes and Morozo could complain that we put in two matches while you put our left arm match first, while our right arm guy is going to. So I calculate everything, in fact, you know, but whatever. And, oh, this is very important now, Rustam. Listen, this one. Rustam Babayev versus Paul Lim.
Rustam Babayev: Who will win? The table will show, as I said, one of the armwrestlers will show the table. I just don't want to say anything like that now, because I respect everyone and I have my own opinion, and I think that I will treat everyone with respect, I will not jump out.
Paolo: okay and again he's very respectful to everybody and he said the table will show and he doesn't want to say i i i and he said the table will show us okay and pauline probably is gonna the same identical way
Paul Linn: only thing i like it from other side i'm like so thankful that you know not everyone is like you because we couldn't promote the event sorry sorry only thing i can guarantee is at the end of the match there'll be a handshake and a hug one way or the other oh yeah what a promotion i can do i'm sorry can i pull the winner hey can i pull the winner
Paolo: At 95 kilos, yes. Yes, why not? No, not at 95. I am not dropping. I am too old to drop to 95. How old are you? 42. Oh, you are very old. Too much older than you guys. Yes, a year from one, two from another.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so let's talk about the match of the gods. Irakli, Zirakashvili, Rustam versus John Brzenk. Rustam? John Brzenk, Irakli, Zirakashvili. Who will win? Brzenk, John Brzenk. John? John, John, winner. Winner? John is winner. Will be. Easy or?
Rustam Babayev: Okay, heavy favorites or his favorite, but not super heavy favorite? I think it's not super easy, but it's not going to be hard. I think so. Because he has breakdowns in these places where he can crush in that place.
Paolo: he said he said that maybe it's not will be like very easy but uh he will not have too many problems because uh iraqis still have some uh uh problems in some small points where john can actually push through yeah i understand you and paul
Paul Linn: Yeah, I had a little bit of doubts and concerns about Don versus Trinko. And of course, he set them to rest. So I've learned my lesson as far as Don Jordan.
Paul Linn: I think it could wind up being a good match, not a quick one. But I think John will be in control. I think Irakli, you know, this is the biggest opportunity of his career. So, I mean, that's a motivating factor that's probably going to bring him in top form as well. But I've learned my lesson in questioning John. Rustam, were you surprised with the outcome of Petrenko-Jombrzyn?
Engin Terzi: David Petrenko and Jean Bazin surprise you? No, no. I thought it would be something like that. Plus or minus. Yeah, he said not really. Yeah, he said not really. It was approximately what he thought it was going to be. Yeah. There was a word in the past that somebody said, I don't remember who said this, but somebody said football is a game that everyone
Engin Terzi: plays at the end germans win or something you know and like can we say the same thing about like of course there are losses too but arm wrestling is something that everyone does at the end you know with john that's that's what i said to uh to everybody you know he will find that edge and possibility how to you know yeah yeah yeah yeah can you translate to rustam
Paolo: He showed it to us. He's perfect.
Engin Terzi: yeah and and uh what's your opinion about this match paulo john will win i will start from beginning yes uh let's say what do you think about uh iraqli and underbite right yeah exactly john will win yeah but iraqli on that wave is like this and then if on that way with john then it didn't really equal from your
Engin Terzi: way or method to find out you know it kind of because you said iraqis on that way i did like this and then john and then when i did this you equal this that uh john is gonna be exactly john will probably can but not with that methodo you know
Paolo: I would agree a little bit with Rustam that travel may put some adjustments on John's performances. And I don't believe that John lost to Ongarbaev in good health and good form. It looks like he just for some reason lost his guest out. It's not guest out, but it's just he was...
Paolo: If something was wrong, okay, in normal circumstances, he would not lose. Anyway, so, Craig Samushia, you start, Paolo. We don't have to. Samushia and who? Craig Tullier. Craig Tullier. That's, oh my God. That's like 50-50.
Paolo: And again, Craig Tudor most likely will hit him to the bed. And I strongly believe that. But Samushia is not a slow puller too. So if it will go deep in the hook, then Samushia will win. So it's 50-50. I don't know. It goes one direction for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So if the match stops, it depends on where the match stops.
Paolo: no it depends for sure yes but uh yeah if you say this way if the mass stops in total equal position it would favor samusha even if uh it's gonna be a little bit losing position for samusha but not too deep you know if it's if it's this far from the pad it's hard but if it's a normal normal so you are saying that even from the halfway halfway he's still a chance
Engin Terzi: yeah so you are thinking that samusha may be stronger one but craig is the more explosive one yes that's correct okay so craig is be he's gonna be able to do his best he will hit if it is enough to put samusha out of position then craig is gonna win saying that he better not get couch you know yes exactly yeah okay exactly yes yeah uh
Engin Terzi: Paul, do you think that Samushia, it was Samushia's first match after pandemic. I mean, like since the pandemic started. So do you think that this guy may be also getting better and better? Oh yeah, I think he's better for now. I think he's definitely better even at a lighter weight now than the guy I faced.
Paul Linn: but i i still i chalk it up to like craig never pulls his own weight he's always pulling in the 90s or the 210 class or whatever walking around 185. so this will be the first time we get to see craig tuye pull somebody his own weight or maybe actually cut a few pounds which i think is is an edge for craig um even though samush is probably a little bit stronger now it's going to come down to if if craig can hit that lane
Paul Linn: correctly with a little bit of up pressure and hand control just a little bit um if he if it's if if he goes if he hits straight sideways and samusha stops and his shoulder in and his hips turn i think that it favors samusha but i think craig's going to be able to create the lane and probably finish quickly yeah if both uh brandon elsa sword and samusha if both were 90 kilo
Engin Terzi: How do you see, how would you see that match? Samushia, both 90 kilos Samushia. Yeah. I would probably favor Samushia slightly, just because I don't- Is there no possibility that Brandon would take- Maybe, there is. Prokopchuk was able to stop him here. Remember last, first round? Yes.
Paul Linn: Even the other rounds, you took him, but Samushia beat him. Yes. I would slightly favor Samushia, but give Brandon a good chance of being able to compromise his wrist. If Brandon could compromise his wrist, then we're going to thoroughly see before. But it really just comes down to how you set up with Brandon. And if Samushia could figure that out quick enough. Yeah, because Craig wasn't Craig's hook inability, you know,
Engin Terzi: know so good he just do a forward move and go around but he was not able to do that again yeah i mean i i see the guys gym performances he times time he post so the guy is a strong guy yeah so he's strong and i see that more he pulls
Engin Terzi: he is also transferring that power more and more to the table with more uh experience you know so that yeah yeah that could be also and what do you think about adam morzinski like is he ready if he's like 95 kilo fully he was 92 kilo last event if he is like fully 95 kilo and just say that if if samusha is 95 kilo or he is 95 kilo zurab goes down to 95 kilo
Engin Terzi: Like, how would you see those matchups? Zurab and Adam? Zurab is about 101 kilos or something. If he goes down to 95, and then...
Paul Linn: I would favor Adam against Samushia at 95 just because of how we saw the Bojadar match go. His staying power in there, I think he would probably outlast Samushia. I think I would slightly favor Zurab at 95 just because the added horsepower. But both of those matches are very interesting. Yeah, I was thinking the same way.
Engin Terzi: Everything is going on my mind all day long, you know, not only this limited, about 100 matches is turning. So that is why I was thinking. And so we covered and then there is Ahmet Yenerer and Robert Baxter. These guys have been in the same category for a few years. Last year, Robert won. This year at Grand Masters, Ahmet won. So they are very close.
Engin Terzi: It was very close, but we will see. I said to them, this is both guys in the grandmasters category, and they will pull. So since you guys don't know about Ahmet, and so this is hard to predict. Another match, the last match is Efe versus the Kazakh guy. So these guys were in the same category. Kazakh guy won gold. Efe took third place in the WAF. But the first round, Efe took him, and then the guy lost on fouls.
Engin Terzi: So he came from B side, and he won the gold. In fact, Sanders beat him. There was some protest. They checked the cameras and give the gold later to the Kazakh guy. So they are going to pull. So since you do not know about the other guy either, the Kazakh guy, hard for you to probably guess anything. Yeah. Anyway, so Rustam, sorry for taking so long. It is one hour and 20 minutes.
Paolo: is there is there anything you want to add is there anything you want to say my friends and we're gonna see you in three weeks and anything you would like to add before we finish
Rustam Babayev: Well, as it was said, mentally and physically I was far from armwrestling. Now, I hope, I will go to the show and I will be closer to armwrestling. And mentally and physically I will get used to it. I will get used to it and find out what armwrestling is like today. To be honest, I haven't officially started it for a long time, but they still put their mark on it.
Paolo: Yeah, he's saying that, yeah, you're right, I was far physically and mentally from armwrestling, but hopefully now...
Paolo: But hopefully now, during the preparation and after the event, I will be all in again, mentally and physically. And he said, yeah, you're right. It was a long time when I officially started some official tournaments for Supermatch, but now I'm all in and we'll see. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it will be good. And if he beats Paul, who does he want to play against?
Paolo: I will ask him to do the polling job. He said, I don't like to look that forward. Let's get it finished. Step by step, huh? Yes, yes.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah. But still, I will talk about something. You beat Tarkashins. You beat him in 2005 Zloty twice in 86 kilo. And then you beat him in a super match. And this guy doesn't know how to go to strap. And he came here also Zolev beat him because he couldn't go strap.
Engin Terzi: But lately, Rustam, this guy learned how to pronate and go to strap. So do you think that if he manages to go to strap against you, next time he may have a chance if you ever pull him? Okay, he says you beat Tad Hatch in 2005 in the 86th category, and then you beat him in the Supermatch.
Paolo: Zaloyev won, but he didn't know how to break through and get into the trap. That's why everyone always won. How do you think, recently he learned to practice and get into the trap. How do you think, if he gets into the trap with you, will he have a chance? I think that in the trap with or without there will be one fight.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he's saying that it's going to be approximately the same arm wrestling because in a strap he can even feel better sometimes than without the strap. Okay, Rustam says that he feels better in strap. Yeah, but the problem maybe, maybe, this guy maybe feeling much better in strap, so maybe.
Paolo: he's saying that i did not pull for a long time so i have to learn it from the beginning you know whatever come on come on he can write the book of arm wrestling yeah anyway so
Engin Terzi: uh and paul after you beat rustem who do you want i only have one date on my calendar and that's the 21st that's it oh yeah yeah i tried to provocate but no no one no one fells into my traps anymore you know you can translate paula
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so thank you very much, guys. Thank you, Paolo, very much. Thank you, Paul, once again. And we will see you in Rustam. My friend, it will be first time and I will be very honored to see you here.
Engin Terzi: Again, you are one of the greatest armistice of all time. To have you here for me is a big honor.

Obviously, you're one of the names that all of us newer guys have followed on our way up. So I appreciate the opportunity and the honor to be your opponent coming back when you're coming back to work. So I appreciate that. Hagen, thank you for setting it up. And I'll do my best. Trust me, nobody enjoys
Engin Terzi: what I am doing more than I enjoy. You can be sure. So I thank you guys. Yeah. I love arm wrestling. Thank you. And this is for me, it's just dream, you know. I'm having big time, you know, except that sometimes they trolls attack me, you know, just like, oh, you don't know anything. You don't know much about it. I'm like, should I answer or not? And then if I answer you, they're like, you are not so humble. Yeah, but I mean, come on. I don't even know who you are. You're trying to teach arm wrestling. If I answer you,
Engin Terzi: Now you're saying that I'm the guilty one and I'm not humble, you know. So I will try to ignore them. Block them. Block them. Yeah, that's what I did. Thank you, Paolo, as always. Thank you, Rustam. Thank you, Paul. And thanks to everyone who watched us. See you guys next month. Take care. We will have a great time. Paolo, we need qualifications, huh? How many?

Paolo: just put them in how many qualifiers do you want me to win one or pre-qualification and then the one that finals the tribes will organize and then you come to istanbul how about this i will i will how about i will win them all two places i'm just kidding that's not a joke
Paul Linn: If the guy shows up to all the qualifiers, he's going to screw everything up. Just give him a match. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're the guys that want to get in. Yeah, after you win your qualification, level one is waiting for you. Don't worry about it. Take care, guys. Thank you. Bye-bye.
