Engin Terzi: So he's asking me what, Ferit Cans? Okay. Paolo just said two minutes. My computer is stuck. Oh, he's coming. Oh, he's asking me if Ferit or Genadi will win. Oh, it's interesting. I should be the one who is asking him.
Engin Terzi: Okay. Hello, Paolo. Hi, Engin. I'm sorry, my computer. It's okay. It's okay, my good friend. It's okay. You're always very helpful. Your addition is always so positive. Thank you for joining. I and Zaur, we tried to communicate a little bit, and we couldn't. But now everything will be fine, hopefully.
Pavlo (Translator): Hello. My name is Pasha. Pasha? Yes. Pavlo. Pavlo. Well, from Ukraine, yes. Pavlo, Pavel, Pasha. Paul in English. Pavel, right? Yes. I understand. You will translate, right? I will translate, yes. Excellent.
Engin Terzi: Okay, people told me, I didn't understand what he was telling me. People told me that he was asking my opinion about Ferit and Genadi match and tell him that I am the one who is going to ask about that and he's the one who's going to share his prediction. That's why we are making this program, you know. Can you tell him that? Yes, Zaur, you asked what he thinks about
Pavlo (Translator): OK.
Engin Terzi: Can you ask him how he has been doing right now? Is it off-season for him? Or is he still training? How is everything going? Yes, they ask if you are now in the off-season or are you training? How are your trainings going? No, now I'm in the off-season. I'm small now. I can go twice a week.
Pavlo (Translator): I can do anything. I can do anything. It's off-season for now, and he's going to the gym a little bit, maybe two times a week, and doing whatever, light weights, shoulders, lats, biceps, triceps, you know, whatever. And how is his weight now? How much do you weigh now?
Engin Terzi: 169 kilos 169 kilos yeah i understand and there there has been a lot of a lot of arguments since he won those uh chechnya events one after another and people often
Engin Terzi: started to say that he is the guy who can be a serious threat for Levan and some people said he is number two guy in the world while a lot of people said that tournaments and super matches are different and Zhao needs to prove himself in super match format. What does he think about all this?
Pavlo (Translator): Okay, Zor, look, he says that many people, after you won two AMC tournaments in Chechnya,
Pavlo (Translator): Many say that you can be a serious opponent for Lebanon now, and it is quite possible that you are now the second in the world. Some say that no, because the tournament, the tournament grid and the supermatch format are very different, so you still need to look and so on. And the question to you is what do you think about all this and what is your opinion?
Zaur Payzulaev: I think that in order for their opinion not to change, I have already understood that for them Hermes and Dave and Jeff are like two top players who are in the top three, top five. That I need to beat some of them so that they already know that, as they say, who is here.
Zaur Payzulaev: I don't know who the contender is. I don't know who the contender is. I don't know who the contender is. I don't know who the contender is. I don't know who the contender is. I don't know who the contender is. I don't know who the contender is. I don't know who the contender is.
Pavlo (Translator): he's saying uh listen uh yeah i want to prove myself uh on a supermatch format
Pavlo (Translator): And he said, I already admit and agreed to pull either Hermes or Chaffee. And he said that right after that, we will see. And he is very confident that they will not be able to, you know, to hold his arm up and he will win.
Pavlo (Translator): either or uh and uh and then she said we will see i i she said i'm not saying that you know who is top three whatever just let me pull any of those and and i'll prove myself so everybody who is uh saying or commenting uh will have to admit that yes i'm i deserve uh to uh fight for a number one spot okay so he's basically saying that by beating some of the guys that
Engin Terzi: at the top, he said that he will deserve to pull Levan. He said that he realizes that he needs to beat some of those really top guys. And then everyone will agree with him that yes, this guy deserves to pull against Levan. So that is his target. Okay. So he is not really flying high and saying that, you know, I'm already there.
Engin Terzi: like i should directly pull levan or something he realizes that he needs to do something in super much format before he faces uh levan okay that's what he says yeah he said no problem i understand chafee and yeah hermes i'm ready to pull them all yeah and and another thing i want to ask a lot of people are thinking that he they are thinking that his end rules is no good and
Engin Terzi: they based this on when he pulled Dennis like three, four times, and then he was just getting caught. So people are thinking that like, not sure if I super, super agree with that because you don't beat someone like three, four times, you know, in a row. But that may be true as well. So does he think that he has a little,
Engin Terzi: Enderest problems and does he think that he can do that adjustment for the upcoming supermasters?
Pavlo (Translator): Well, again, everyone saw your practice with Denis, and Denis is always there, or Slava, it doesn't matter, they say different things, but everyone watched when, and everyone also discusses, they say that you may not have enough endurance, and maybe you need to pay attention to endurance.
Zaur Payzulaev: Please comment on this practice and what happened, and what do you think about your endurance as well? Everything is simple. At first, I knew that it would be like that. After the competition, I have the experience to fight. Usually, this injury comes, because when the hand is already after the competition,
Zaur Payzulaev: I understood that I would be 10 15 maybe 20 weaker and I will have these micro-explosions it's always even in Russia when I didn't win everyone easily, I had micro-trauma because I was a sharp jerk and then
Zaur Payzulaev: For a long time. I'll put it this way. As for endurance, people don't understand that you can't judge by this sparring, by my endurance. I'll explain why. Maybe I have some problems with endurance. But not as much as in the video. Not as much as I have problems. I just want, if Denis and I agree,
Zaur Payzulaev: When I will be in good shape, when he will be in his normal state, and then I will meet him, and then I will come fresh, and then if it will be so, then yes, then I will only agree that I really do not have endurance.
Zaur Payzulaev: Okay, what he's saying that it's very hard to, you know,
Pavlo (Translator): make a judgment but that particular uh practice uh because he said listen first of all Denise is not weak second of all uh I was after the tournament and for sure I have some micro uh micro injuries and maybe not that micro you know even I was uh relatively easy winning I was starting really uh hard
Pavlo (Translator): and uh they're you know they're serious athletes there who i was winning for uh and he said about my endurance uh yes maybe i admit that i may have some problems with endurance but it's nothing like you saw on that video because first of all it was right after tournament second of all all the travel and the stuff and yeah
Engin Terzi: it's it's all making an impact so they're trying to work with dennis something up to meet up fresh and fresh and do some uh another practice and and he he mentioned uh two names he mentioned uh hermes and he mentioned uh dave cheffy uh how does he see his chances against these two guys
Pavlo (Translator): in specific explanation. Thank you for the answer. You said earlier that you named two names, Ermes and Dave Chaffee. How do you assess your chances, more specifically with Dave and Ermes? Let's take Ermes. Ermes, I noticed,
Zaur Payzulaev: He has no speed, no attack. He's trying to use his pronator to sprain and pull it to himself. But I think he won't make it. He won't do anything, just because I... My tactics are not comfortable for him, I think. I hold the fist, I hold everything, I hold the lead. I just hit him with a bat. If I just... Even if I compare the facts,
Zaur Payzulaev: I remember Vitalik was on the same level with Sheffield. I even said that Vitalik was stronger, but he went there all killed. After the tournament, his hands were falling off. I wrote to him, he still went. Well, okay, then he'll show everything, you'll see.
Zaur Payzulaev: He can't hold on to this start mode, because I'm still pressing all my muscles. Urmes doesn't have this. He doesn't have this push-up. He only has a pronator, and then he starts to suffer, he starts to get bored.
Zaur Payzulaev: It's hard for me to imagine how he can catch me. It's very hard. I just don't know how much time it will take for him to catch me. But if I'm in shape, I doubt it. I see how if I push Dave Chaffee almost to the end, right to the pillow, he just clings there at the end. But if I go with such a mass, he won't have time.
Pavlo (Translator): Okay. I will translate, we discuss Hermes in details. I will translate Hermes first and we'll come back to Dave so I'm not losing the details, okay? So basically what he said that Hermes, he have his
Pavlo (Translator): posting his wrist and his pronation and that's his main move but he doesn't really have a start move which uh which zaur said that his start is uh that
Pavlo (Translator): faster and powerful to decide that their mass will not be able to do anything uh with uh you know his style so because because of his back pressure and the side pressure yes yes that's what zara said and he said listen i am holding my wrist and fingers too it's not that i have weak point there but my very strong point is my impact on the start and my side pressure and my mass
Pavlo (Translator): is that great that he will not be able to catch it because he he start uh uh comparing to Dave chafing where Hermes been catching him pretty close to the pad uh Dave chafing is lighter and he said with my mess with my start and side pressure he said I I don't don't see how Hermes will be able to catch this to pronate and bring bring it back and change the angles with a posting
Pavlo (Translator): So basically he's saying that Hermes doesn't have enough side pressure to match his starts. Yes. Yes. Okay. And he said, I don't know. I have to not train for half a year, you know, to lose the start and not have enough side compared to Hermes. And he compared them to Vitaly and Dave. And he said, they're very, very close. Plus she said, Vitaly was on a,
Engin Terzi: Vitaly was not in his best shape after tournaments, whatever, tired. And he said, Vitaly... Oh, you're saying that Vitaly, because of the Chechnya event? Yes. Before that one? Yes. Especially those tough matches with Ferit, you know, he had this... Okay. You're saying that Vitaly was not 100% when he pulled Dave Chaffee? Yes. Yeah. And some people say the same thing about Dave Chaffee when he pulled
Pavlo (Translator): about air mass but just i mean we need to i mean when you show up right you pull i mean so there is nothing it's your problem if you 100 or not i agree but let me come back and ask about me okay and i will be back to you okay uh okay so
Zaur Payzulaev: I think Def is stronger than Gasparini. If he prepares, he is more powerful, stronger. I looked at him, I think, after the year, he was also tired. In my opinion, he agreed within a month. He even went to replace someone.
Zaur Payzulaev: I'm not sure, to be honest. I can't say. I remember that there was a small break. Yes, it was quick. Everyone knows, everyone says that he was out of shape. He's just a guy who's ready to fight with everyone, but he doesn't think that he needs to get to this point. He just fights and that's it.
Zaur Payzulaev: He just fought today, fought for two weeks. And he will prepare well, I think he will win. In this regard, it will be a little more difficult with him, but I think when we meet with him in the tie, it will be enough for me to beat him in the center and that's it, I will beat him too, because he will collapse.
Zaur Payzulaev: Okay. Okay. Okay.
Pavlo (Translator): Okay, we've been talking about Dave, and he said, you know what, I believe that when Dave met Vitaly, he was not his 100% also, because it was, in his opinion, short-term notice, and Dave didn't have enough time to get 100% ready. Anyway, he said that Dave is a harder opponent than Gasparini, but he has a plan.
Pavlo (Translator): for that uh straps he said yes traps I believe that Dave doesn't have uh uh much chance because of my uh posting and side pressure power and uh that's that's the plan for Dave basically but he said that Dave is a very serious opponent and uh I think that I think that the reason that he sees Dave uh very dangerous it is because
Engin Terzi: both have very powerful starts at the center both Zaur at the center is very powerful also Dave at the center is very powerful you know because Zaur's technique is just like it's like one silver bullet you understand that is how it is we don't really see him in long matches so the one that who is
Engin Terzi: very very good at the center and that that that has chance to stop him yeah Hermes also believes that Hermes also doesn't think that uh Zaur can do much to him uh Hermes thinks that uh not to steer the pot but I would like to hear his opinion he said like
Engin Terzi: Revas, Genadi, you know, Morozov, I think he meant, like, Dave Chaffee, you know, all these guys, he believes that he's favored against Zaur. Can you ask him his opinion about this one? Yes, sir. If that is the opinion, let him think what he thinks about this one.
Pavlo (Translator): You were also discussed with Hermes. Hermes is more or less sure that he will be able to win.
Pavlo (Translator): But we also discussed the level of athletes who are now fighting in IS vs. WEST, such as Genadi Kvikvinia, Rivas, and even Ertem Morozov, in my opinion, they mentioned. He says, well, I don't see that Zaur will just take it like that, come and immediately win for everyone. He says, well, it's kind of under the question a little bit. You have to fight and watch. What is your opinion on this?
Zaur Payzulaev: I just want to take... It happens in the crowd. I want to take the loudest one, the one who makes noise. I'm just joking. I want to take the strongest one, whom they consider to be strong, and just do their job. That's it. I don't even need to say anything. Just give it to me, and that's it. And then you'll talk. And then you'll talk.
Zaur Payzulaev: Okay.
Pavlo (Translator): uh okay and the answer was like this listen uh there is nothing to talk about much uh yes maybe but give me the best one or whoever talks the most and uh set up the super match and uh i will prove yeah he said no no need to speculate a lot yesterday he's ready
Zaur Payzulaev: So if anyone would trust himself, he said, let's go, you know. He doesn't want to talk, but just want to do it. That's what I understand. That's exactly what he said, yeah. I would like to add. Ideally, it would be good to make a vote, right? For example, with whom Zaur should vote? With Chaffee, Hermes, Cadorette, or who else? Just make a vote.
Pavlo (Translator): Okay, again, if somebody can set up the open poll, and just, you know, just make a list of the opponents, he said, whoever on the top whoever, whoever deserves, you know,
Pavlo (Translator): to be named to the top and let the poll choose the opponent. And he said, I'm ready. Anyone, anyone who will, you know, who people thinks that we need to pull against too. He said, I'm fine. I'm fine. No problem. Set it up. I'll prove. I understand. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe, maybe we make a poll and then see what the chat thinks, you know, who should is our,
Pavlo (Translator): He said, whatever you say is good.
Engin Terzi: Whatever you say his opponent is or whatever the poll you will create will say his opponent is. So he says that he's ready. I understand. He basically says, Engin, I trust your judgment. Define my opponent. Just define me. Let's stop talking cheap. Let's do the job.
Pavlo (Translator): more more walking less talking yes so that you would understand that also what my point is here okay so i will ask zaur
Pavlo (Translator): Can you ask Zaur if we saw the list of the West vs West matches?
Pavlo (Translator): Yeah, he saw the list. He said, maybe I don't remember on top of my head every name. No, I will ask him. There is one question for him before we go there. One guy asked him right now, as of now,
Engin Terzi: It doesn't matter 5%, 10%, or 50%, whatever. Who are the guys that have chance to beat Levan?
Pavlo (Translator): But if you explain, not that he would think that he would beat him, but like he has some chance, possibility to beat Levan. Zaur, look, the question is this. That is, it doesn't matter if it's 5% chance or 50% chance. They ask, who do you think will get on the list of people who have a chance to beat Levan?
Zaur Payzulaev: Well, if in general we take the close ones, who are generally positive winners, right? Or in general? Well, in general, those who have a chance, at least a small one. Well, I sincerely believe that there is a chance, let's say, for Denis Tseplenkov, right? With proper preparation, Denis Tseplenkov can win him. It will be easy enough for him to catch him in one of...
Zaur Payzulaev: to catch everything, to stop everything. Then Denis is already very tenacious, persistent. He loves these long fights. But he really needs to gain physical strength and weight. I think 140 kilograms, at least he should be as clean as before. In this case, I am sure that he can
Zaur Payzulaev: I'm not saying that 100% will win, but the chances are very high. Okay, I won't even say how much. Let it be 50 to 50. The chances are very high. I also have chances. I'll take 50 to 50. I won't say not 45, not 70, not 30. 50 to 50, I also have good chances. I know what I'm stronger in, I know what I'm weaker in.
Zaur Payzulaev: I understand very well what I need to add. With Hermes, I will say, there is a chance not only to win, but I will say, there is a chance, let's say, I would say, to take some round, well, due to the hand, maybe, something there, somewhere. Well, let's say, let it be 10%, right? With Hermes, take 10%.
Zaur Payzulaev: It's possible, it's possible. I see him motivated, I see him preparing. I really want him to at least one round, or at least, even if he doesn't win, to show such a good mood, a fight, so that the audience feels good.
Zaur Payzulaev: And now I have to think about it. Yes, Jerry Kadaret is somewhere on the horizon, Artyom Morozov is probably somewhere on the horizon. So, I remind you. By the way, about Artyom Morozov. Artyom Morozov is producing very well.
Zaur Payzulaev: I believe that he still has a year to train, to gain a little weight, to get used to this weight. And he can also, even if not in the first, not in the second, but in the third, already start to cling to it and already start to fight. He is such a strongman, as if young, he still has a lot ahead of him.
Zaur Payzulaev: Do you remember all this?
Pavlo (Translator): yeah i'm making notes you know you you are einstein man einstein i am making notes because i knew that i will not remember making notes okay so okay so uh he started with dennis
Pavlo (Translator): and he said that uh not today but if dennis uh will be able to put some quality mess on and his opinion about 140 kilos total uh he uh have a very good chance to stop the match and if the match stopped then it's dennis favorite because he have a good endurance and he likes those uh prolongated matches uh in a different positions but uh he said probably 50 50
Pavlo (Translator): He is saying that if Dennis comes back, gets in very good shape, 140 kilos, and then 50-50, it would be a good match, you see. Yes. The next one was himself, Zaur, and he said, I understand my weaknesses and I understand my best points. And he said that some of the moves are better and some of the moves are worse.
Pavlo (Translator): but i understand those uh weaknesses and i know how to fix them uh i need a prep time but uh his chances and his opinion about 50 50. so but he's saying that not as on air when he is totally ready to face him yes yes okay yes okay the next name he said ermis uh he said that uh
Pavlo (Translator): his chances are not that high, but he would like to say that he may take one or two rounds, or at least he wish that he can show some interesting arm wrestling. But he said that his chance still chance, like 10% chance. Okay, the same as yesterday, that was it. 10% chance against that one, yeah. But he wishes that
Engin Terzi: he is going Hermes is going to find a weakness in Levan so he wishes that there is a way to do something yeah against his wrist and he believes that it's a possibility that he may win one round
Pavlo (Translator): okay so uh and uh one more name he mentioned uh he said i would not put his on the list right now uh he needs another another year yes yeah he's a little bit too young but his progress his uh speed of his progress and how he built and that he is very powerful young kid uh he said that uh maybe in a year uh he may lose the first two rounds but like in the third round
Engin Terzi: he may start stopping him and then we may see him uh yeah same thing same thing whenever i asked morozo i said morozo like would you pull lower and he said i need time i need to get bigger though he said that those guys like levan zaur said that they are too big and too strong but he never said that
Pavlo (Translator): He can never beat them. He just said he needs a little bit more time. Yeah, he's very young. Let me translate two words to the Russian, okay? Engin also said the same thing you said about Hermes. Larratt said the same thing. They talked about it just recently. He gave Hermes 10% that he has a very small chance, but he has a chance.
Pavlo (Translator): He also talked to Ertem, and they discussed you and Levan. And Ertem also said, he says, no, I'm not ready yet, give me a little time. And it is quite possible that I will be able to fight at this level. I still have to gain weight and prepare well. But I will probably be able to compete soon. He will be able to, but later.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I mean, also I want to add that, in my opinion, everyone on this earth is heavily underdog against Levan, as we all accept this fact. But I also believe if anyone has chance to do something to Levan right now, as of now, for sure, Ermes is one of them.
Engin Terzi: I'm not saying Hermes will be able to do something, but if anyone can do, for sure Hermes is in that conversation. And I think that as of now, Hermes is the one that deserves the shot the most, you know, against Lewandowski. I think that's a very well deserved super match if they pull, which I believe they will. Do you want me to translate to Russian with Toru? Yeah.
Pavlo (Translator): Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.
Pavlo (Translator): Who are the armwrestlers on the ground today? Hermes is one of those who deserved the right to fight Levan. I'm not saying that he has some very good chances or something else, but he definitely deserved to try to fight. I agree, but he kind of went through a number of opponents and, as a fighter without rules, went through and then reached the first contender.
Pavlo (Translator): What happens for the match Gasparini and Jerry? Jerry got injured?
Pavlo (Translator): Jerry, while he was doing very heavy bench press, he got his shoulder injured, yeah. Okay, okay. Yes, Zaur, yes, he was injured. Jerry was injured when it was supposed to happen. Yes, he squeezed some kind of heavy pressure and injured himself.
Engin Terzi: Zaur says, yeah, it would be interesting to see those two steal the match. Because of the style, right? One is outside, one is, you know, diving there. And I don't think that if Hermes would pull against Jerry, he would just go totally outside.
Engin Terzi: I think he would be training for the center from the downside of his hand. Because, I mean, if you do this, you are really, really heavily gambling. You are going through somewhere that hundreds of people went and they didn't like it for sure. Even if some of them won, most of them didn't like to go there. Absolutely. That's why Jerry likes it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: anyway so maybe maybe yeah in in my opinion in my opinion um if there would be a match to choose number two there are a few a few candidates for that matchup but for sure Hermes and Zaur for sure if they would pull you understand right now we don't know who is number one we think it's Levan but they need to pull
Engin Terzi: so before we they pull it is not writing to talk about you know any other match for levan and hermes you can talk about it but not to setting you understand openly it's not right you know because they both will have a match so everyone should focus there first then other than that but if they would pull i don't think that everyone i don't think anyone would say oh this this match doesn't
Engin Terzi: deserve like for number two spot. You know, I'm talking about Ermes versus Zaur. So if we just go, another question I will ask him. He is also planning to compete Chechnya event in the beginning of April. And I know that that event also will be in Ramadan while he is fasting. I know that he would be fasting
Engin Terzi: And so I heard that Vitaly Laletin will go there very well prepared. How does he see his chance against Laletin? Because last time they met Laletin and Slayev had about 20 seconds long, you know, match. Is he confident that the similar thing will happen?
Pavlo (Translator): if they meet next time again. I know that Zaur is planning to perform in Chechnya again at the competition in early April.
Pavlo (Translator): And I also know that it will be during Ramadan and I know that Zaur will be fasting. At the same time, I also know that Vitalik will be very well prepared for this tournament and he will come in very good shape.
Pavlo (Translator): I understand that I will be weaker by 10-15%, because it is impossible to be stronger if you can't eat and drink during the game.
Zaur Payzulaev: How many hours does it take? Well, 14-20 hours, of course. But I hope I have ligaments. I mean, I will train. I want to train in Chechnya. For 2-3 hours there, I don't know, the night is longer, let's say. And I want to keep the ligament. The muscles will sink, of course, but the ligaments, I hope,
Pavlo (Translator): he understands that yes he may lose about 10 to 15 percent uh compared to his best best forms in life but he have a plan
Pavlo (Translator): uh how to make it he will finish his uh training in chichina uh which is uh giving him another two or three hours uh non-fasting time yeah yeah yeah i will have to not drink not eat for like whatever 14 16 17 hours he won't be able to eat for 30 days you know 30 days so yeah it is going to affect his power
Pavlo (Translator): yeah yeah so he said yes i understand that but uh he have a plan and he said yeah my muscle uh muscle uh probably will be suppressed a little bit but he says the tendons and everything else most likely will not suffer from this so he said i'm pretty confident i'll be fine he said that he's gonna win uh he said yeah with the help of allah yes
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I understand. So, yeah, I wish him the best. I know it's a disadvantage. Seriously, I know it as well. You know, when you don't drink or eat at all, like 16 hours, 17 hours a day, and you work during that time, it is hard to maintain the strength. But I have
Engin Terzi: Like whenever I fast, I train like two hours after I start eating and drinking, you know, and somehow in Ramadan, like my performance is going up. I think that the reason is I think the body, the toxins, everything is just, I think cleaning during, during that time, your body rest. And, and I don't know why, but my performance is increasing.
Engin Terzi: But of course, it is very hard during the day that I'm expecting him to not to be fasting on the competition day. That's what I mean. And it is so since he said that he is losing 10%, 15%. So it means that he doesn't get affected in a very positive way. So
Pavlo (Translator): Yes, Engin said that he knows very well how it is, because he does it too. But he says, you know, I got used to it, I trained during Ramadan two hours after I started eating, but all my
Pavlo (Translator): all my body, yes, it says, somehow it was so rested, it says, all these toxins, it says, are being released during this period, it says, but I was so fresh, it says, so, it says, yes, I felt that I was losing a little muscle strength, it says, but the overall state was better, it says, and at the competition, it says, I showed normal results. I see, well, I also want the same example, that is, I have part of the weight gone, maybe 100 grams there,
Pavlo (Translator): yeah he said yeah i understand that and the plan is pretty much the same as you you've been doing and he said yeah probably i'll be like seven to nine kilos lighter but uh hopefully the attendance strengths and uh conditions will be the same so yeah so loud
Engin Terzi: During the daytime, you sleep. During the nighttime, training and eating. Yes. Anyway, so let me ask him some messages that he would probably know about Atlas.
Engin Terzi: Does he know Corey West? And if he knows, what does he think left arm match against Ferit Osmanli? What do you think if you know Corey West and Ferit Osmanli left and left hand? Yes. Who will win? Who will win, right? Yes, who will win, yes.
Engin Terzi: He thinks that Ferit will win the left. And he thinks that right arm is tougher match for Ferit against Genadi.
Pavlo (Translator): 50 to 50 percent. For me, they are close to 50-50. Okay. Yeah, he said that I want to see this match very much. And for him, it's like 50-50 match. He's very interesting. Can you ask him when he's going to Chechnya exactly? When are you going to Chechnya? I think before...
Engin Terzi: Okay, so let's go another one. Corey West, Arif Ertem, right arm.
Engin Terzi: Zaur, do you know Alizhan Muratov? Do you know Alizhan Muratov? With Oleg Petrenko.
Engin Terzi: Alizhan is 95 kilo, Petrenko is 105 kilo. And the category is 105. You may say that why I choose Alizhan. Alizhan just won the super heavyweight. This guy is good enough to do a title match.
Engin Terzi: Do you know who Paul Linn is? Yes, I saw him. He's a strong athlete from the US.
Pavlo (Translator): yeah he knows pauline he saw him many times uh he's a very strong uh sportsman from usa to win uh he said yeah he's a legend legendary arm wrestler and yeah sometimes legends lost as well but
Engin Terzi: if he is close to prime he he looked favored on the paper but legends we can't say that they they always win but yeah yeah that his uh experience will uh will do the thing anyway yeah um okay then let's talk about
Engin Terzi: Does he know about Lightweights? Does he know Mindaugas Tarasaitis? Yes, I've seen him. He's from 1975. Yes, he knows. Okay, but does he know Nurdaulet Aidarkhan? Nurdaulet Aidarkhan is the current 75 kilo WAF champion. And he and Mindaugas is going to do for the world title match. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: It is good that unlike many of the other heavyweights, super heavyweights, Zaur is closely following
Pavlo (Translator): the many categories. That's good, Zaur. Very good. Good armwrestling fan. Good armwrestling fan. Zaur says he's different from all the other superweights. He says he watches armwrestling very closely. He says he knows all the athletes very well. He says, well done. He says, thank you very much. Yes, I watched all the European and world championships very closely.
Pavlo (Translator): Yeah, he said that I've been watching all the clips and I've been watching all the European Championships and World Championships. Okay. And let's go to another one. He says Nurdaulet is going to win. And does he know Barbora Bajciova?
Zaur Payzulaev: This girl won in weightlifting. I'm against Gabriela. It will be with Gabriela. It will be interesting, because this new one, she has been progressing well for 3-4 years. And she is now such a stable champion, wins the championship. But Gabriela is just an explosive power.
Zaur Payzulaev: I would like to put 50-50, but here Gabriela with his power. I like the technique. I think Gabriela will win. I think the technique is similar.
Pavlo (Translator): yeah he said that uh I want to say that it's 50 50 but it's probably not and he said that Gabriela was your start and it was your powerful uh side uh technique he said I yeah I still think that Gabriela will win
Engin Terzi: uh he was watching barbara and he said he she she's getting pretty stable and she's uh winning a lot of tournaments now but he said probably gabriella uh is uh you've got more experience and yeah i understand yeah also strong very strong stronger you know um i want to tell something to the chat now guys um my as you know that my intention is not to entertain you guys
Engin Terzi: but also I try to bring different categories and some unknown superstars of armwrestling to your attention so that armwrestling community would get to know these guys and these guys would get opportunity to be known by your fans. So I would, if you guys like what I am doing, please support the event because
Engin Terzi: I want to continue doing what I am doing, not only entertainment, but together at the same time to bring the spotlight on these guys at the main stage. But I will be doing this as long as you guys support these events. If you guys think that we should only promote what is already famous and
Engin Terzi: only the big guys, then we can do that way as well. But trust me, the sport is not going to grow with that understanding. It will be like the old times that it will be circling around five, six guys all the time. So if you really like our sport to grow, if you really like what I am doing, continue to support.
Pavlo (Translator): Let me translate real fast for a Russian speaking audience. I will translate it very quickly. He just turned to the audience, who are writing comments in the chat. He says, I really love what I do. And he says, thank you all for your support, continue to support. He says, but I do it not only for entertainment, to entertain everyone. He says, I also bring athletes to this.
Pavlo (Translator): who are already stars of armwrestling, but who are not so public, you know, inflated and advertised. He says, I want these supermatches to happen. I'm interested in your opinion, if you want to see only entertainment in this, and then it will be just a circle of five people, which, in principle, will never really change.
Zaur Payzulaev: What do you think about West vs West? What do you think about West vs West? What do you think about West vs West? What do you think about West vs West? What do you think about West vs West? What do you think about West vs West? What do you think about West vs West?
Zaur Payzulaev: So interesting. I just watched. And before that, in the top 8 or there, I have never seen such fights. There were so many very interesting pairs. That is, really, the eyes are happy to watch these fights. Just with pleasure. Popcorn, right? You look at the camera and that's it. Well, just cool, in general, pairs. It's better not to invent, I don't know.
Zaur Payzulaev: I wouldn't even think about it now. It's just, it seems to me, not even one person is thinking about it, it's just a team work, it seems to me. It's hard for one person to think about it.
Pavlo (Translator): uh uh giving you a huge compliment from his uh side and he said that uh this event how the actual
Pavlo (Translator): arm arm fights the actual super matches are set he said i never saw in my life that somebody can choose the super matches better he said it's like a blockbuster you're getting your popcorn coke and you're just watching that's my intention
Pavlo (Translator): and he said this is an eye candy to watch those uh arm fights he said i never saw uh that somebody somebody is getting any better arm fights or super matches uh than it's done he said i don't know it's uh probably teamwork or maybe he said maybe i'm mistaken and doing everything by himself but he said this is amazing yeah thank you uh
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he said that all the fans from all the world will say thank you for sure. It's just amazing. I also thank everyone for supporting. Tell Zaur that I have won many world, European, so many titles I won.
Engin Terzi: Every time I won, it was in our tiny, tiny bit world. Nobody was aware. I came with gold. I came home. Nobody cared. While some people plays balls deservingly, they get incredible recognition. But compared to them, we shouldn't be
Engin Terzi: 0.1%, you understand? We shouldn't be that unknown. So that always for many years, it hurt me. And now God gave me opportunity to serve this sport. And now I'm doing my best. I'm trying to bring arm wrestling where it deserves to be. So that is kind of my reaction
Engin Terzi: for all those years. So I couldn't get that attention as an athlete, as an elite athlete. But now I have opportunity to serve the athletes. So I do my best to treat them as superstars. As you realize, I do trading cards for them, this and that.
Pavlo (Translator): Let me translate, Enge. Yeah, let me translate that. Okay, he's like that, yeah, a little bit. He says, listen, I was an elite athlete for 30 years, and I won many different titles, and world championships, and European championships, and all kinds of tournaments. He says, I came back, he says, with gold, he says, but no one really had it before, you know, he says.
Pavlo (Translator): No one really knew about it. We were just hanging around in our little armwrestling world, and that was it. God gave me the opportunity to bring our favorite sport to another level. I take advantage of this opportunity, I enjoy it, I try to support all of our athletes as much as possible.
Pavlo (Translator): Why do people who play football come back and the whole country jumps and jumps, and Armwrestlers don't? He says, we're not worse, we're maybe better. I'm trying to do all this at the maximum level and bring our sport to the maximum star level. It's noticeable that the soul is invested, that it's really what you like. You can see that the person likes what he likes,
Pavlo (Translator): Yeah, he said that anybody can tell from the side that you put your heart and soul into this. And yeah, it's recognizable, right? You like it, you love it, and you're so into it. Yeah, let's go to some of the next matches. What does he think about Michael Todd versus Ongar Bair?
Zaur Payzulaev: What do you think about the match between Michael Todd and Monster and Ongarbaev? I think Michael Todd has a good chance. He has a good chance, but I think Ongarbaev can fight in different techniques. He can fight in the jump, he can fight in the triceps and in the top.
Pavlo (Translator): Yeah, he said that Michael Todd has very good chances, but Kydyrgali is a very complete athlete. He can pull.
Pavlo (Translator): hooked up whatever he can transition from top into triceps and stuff like that so he said I will not be surprised if Michael will win but uh he said I think that okay so he is saying that Michael is dangerous for almost anyone to win but there are some athletes are capable enough to figure out how to beat Michael and
Engin Terzi: Ongar Babayev is one of them, but it's not 100% that he can do it because, yeah, last word is said by Zaur. I don't know much about Zaur. We didn't spend time together. And also there is a language barrier. But we tell him that I am impressed by his knowledge and
Pavlo (Translator): point of view, say that I'm impressed, you know. He says he doesn't know you personally well, he says we didn't spend much time together, he says, well, plus the language barrier, we can't talk so freely, he says, well, he says, I'm just surprised, he says, and impressed, he says, with your knowledge of armwrestling and your point of view, how do you see it all, he says, very nice.
Zaur Payzulaev: Yes, I studied the techniques very carefully. I can already analyze how the fight will go. And how many times it turned out in practice. You rarely get so excited when someone wins.
Pavlo (Translator): Yeah, he said, thank you. And he said, yeah, I spent time to watch technique of different athletes. And by now, he said, I can do some pretty good judgment and analysis of the matches. And some of my predictions are good because of the spent time and understanding. A lot of people are just so much focused on themselves. They don't so much care about
Engin Terzi: What do you think about John Brzenk and Irakli Zirakashvili?
Zaur Payzulaev: I see that Irakli has a very good upper hand, but it's not clear what he's going to do, because as I watched the match a long time ago, when he was fighting Samushia, I thought he would win, but in the end he won one round and quickly lost, and then he lost in the end.
Zaur Payzulaev: And here it can also be the same. I think the twin will still win. Technically, he can even lose the first two times, but then win three times. He'll just find the key. The twin is the person who finds the keys. That is, they can even hold on with a broken brush, while the person hits, and that's it. And then, as it were,
Zaur Payzulaev: like a predator, let's say, like a python, on a suffocating take, and then it's already in its own swamp. Yes, in the spirit of the element.
Pavlo (Translator): Okay, he said that, yeah, he said that he'd been watching both of them and Irakli, his gains are impressive and he's gaining constantly and his top is very impressive. But he said, I'm not sure what about endurance still, because his endurance wasn't too good before. So he said that he may win even two rounds.
Pavlo (Translator): uh but uh overall supermatch berzing will win and he said he will find the keys and he will find the edge and then he will uh how to translate it exactly um he's like a python will uh you know bring him into his swamp
Zaur Payzulaev: Brzenk will win, I think. He has a very strong hand. He has very good control. Yeah, yeah. He said, yeah, Brzenk will win because of his strong sides and... 55 to 45 for Brzenk. With a small...
Engin Terzi: 55 45 for breathing i understand and before before i ask uh jerry versus swedco match i would like to ask him um he is like so much focused on that incredible back pressure followed by an incredible side pressure
Engin Terzi: to finish the match. It's very good. You know, it is possible that our athletes like this, that like, like not totally the same way, but just like really incredible right by the start, direct is bad. Like Travis versions are in the, I used to be similar way. And of course I have done hook everything, but, um, can you ask, you see,
Engin Terzi: also planning like making any plans just in case if a match stops because he from outside no disrespect to him from outside he looks so much like dependent on that one incredible move very powerful and almost perfect yes that's there but does he have any plan
Engin Terzi: if the match stops he does not look so effective if the match is balanced so far this is what i see you ask him like what he thinks about this okay uh
Pavlo (Translator): The movement is amazing right from the start to the pillow. We know a lot of such athletes. Even I was once with the same technique, start to the pillow. It looks like you're a little dependent on one powerful movement.
Zaur Payzulaev: And the question is, do you have a plan and do you have the technique in case the match will be more balanced with your opponent and he stops somewhere? I think you don't need to change anything. I will just strengthen this movement. And if something stops somewhere, I will just make a fold to push the train back again.
Zaur Payzulaev: how to say in the pillow, that is, something to change the technique, something there for a long time, there it takes to work, it takes you to pull, that is, but so much so that it stands there for a minute, this is not mine, that's how Pushkar fought, yes, how he fought with his son, just explosive force, this is my nature, this is my nature, and so to fight with
Zaur Payzulaev: I don't see the point of such a weight. It's stupid. With such a weight, with someone to fight with, you will always be weaker than others. Therefore, I will use the strength of the pronator, the key, due to your weight. I will just do all the work with all the weight. Even if they stop me, I will not lose strength there, I will just make a fall and break it again.
Pavlo (Translator): uh uh okay he said uh well there is always a plan but he said I'm not gonna change anything in my technique because this is my technique and that's what I do that's what I'm good with uh and he said I don't see really a uh a sense uh for a long prolongated pools uh or arm wrestling a minute or half a minute matches uh
Pavlo (Translator): he said if if there is a situation that I miss something or uh you know I couldn't win right away there is always a possibility to fall out and restart or anyhow restart the match uh and he said that's probably the best technique for me because it was my weight if I will get into prolongated match I will guess out and I can't he said I can pull longer but
Engin Terzi: just don't see don't see the sense of it no no not the pull during the match but just like more like control type of training like hand control instead of only flash
Pavlo (Translator): does he train like just to get positioned you know to have the full control sometimes from what i understand no but let me re-ask specific question um
Zaur Payzulaev: To be honest, I didn't feel anything at all. I mean, I was doing exercises on a 60-centimeter bar, and it was both on the wrist and on the side ligament. I mean, I was doing push-ups from top to bottom. It was like a push-up.
Zaur Payzulaev: One exercise on the block is the first stage, when I hit the center. The second stage is the push-up. Push-up. You just train the impulse, you just hit it, and then push-up, push-up, push-up. That's what I trained. I trained the wrist and the side there. But this exercise hurts me more often than I used to do it two weeks ago. Now I do it once a month, and the rest is auxiliary.
Pavlo (Translator): he said that uh yeah he's doing a little bit uh he's doing let's say uh uh here we handle 60 millimeters and he's uh pulling towards him and uh like straining finishing uh of the arm wrestling with this move he is bringing it to him and then to the side he's all the way to the bed
Engin Terzi: but uh it's painful for him so he doesn't do that often uh but other than that he doesn't really uh accent on a uh you know control yeah it looks like he is he's mostly dependent on his brachioradialis and pronator and then tightest strap and then pin the guy by you know making the guy weaker with this tightness yeah he's very very strong there if he adds
Engin Terzi: a wrist that is just like super, super soft, which is look already very good. But I think that because of his incredible back pressure is also lessening the pressure that opponent can apply him because he's just so much pulling from here, the strap, the other side of the strap is just pulling the guy's back pressure. So the guy is not so much able to apply pressure to his hand because he's helping so much to his hand to not to have the pressure. And
Engin Terzi: yeah i'm just saying that if he builds a hand that doesn't get at all like this and like he's doing very well against slave against ferret against uh relating then then he will be really big threat for levan but as of now i see like him and levan him going and then maybe possibly levan is
Engin Terzi: maybe taking his hand, you know, right now. I say maybe, not this maybe, as of now, I see this, but I don't want to disrespect, you know, so that's this.
Pavlo (Translator): Well, he commented in such a way that, you know, from the side, he did such an analysis of how you fight. He said, well, what he showed, he said, you have a very powerful movement, here, here, through the hand, you pull the opponent out on yourself, and then you just kill him in the direction. But, he says, when you start fighting now, well, already, perhaps, with Levan,
Pavlo (Translator): He says, I would probably recommend Zaur to add strength to his wrist. He says, we haven't seen that you're losing it so far with the opponents you were fighting with. He says, but with Levan, I see that if you leave, Levan can slow down your wrist and maybe it's a little compromised. So he says, I recommend you, if you can, add a little to the wrist.
Zaur Payzulaev: I have already started, I have already built a plan for myself. And I know what to add to the brush. To add a brush, a brush, fingers. That is, not just there, I will already...
Zaur Payzulaev: work, most likely, behind the table, in certain corners. Since I don't have sparring partners, I start with the brush behind the table. Because it's good, then my impulse stays in my head. That is, when I fight, I already imagine all the training, and I already have it on my own. In any case, Ivan's brush is stronger than mine.
Zaur Payzulaev: Levan has a stronger wrist, but his fingers are stronger. I've never tried this exercise in my life. It's called Mazurenko's Hand. I don't even know how much I can do. I need to prove it somewhere. It's interesting. I know I need to develop it. I need time.
Zaur Payzulaev: Well, I've analyzed it for a long time, I've already understood. What I didn't need from others, I needed everything from him.
Pavlo (Translator): yeah thank you engine and he said yes i already uh uh wrote my uh working workout plan and preparation plan and he said yes i already put it put in what you're saying because i know that levan's wrist
Pavlo (Translator): and levan's fingers are better than mine stronger than mine and he said yeah i did not need it for a previous opponents but yes i will need everything for levan and he is already addressing those uh uh those weaknesses uh in his new uh preparation plan so yes thank you yeah okay and then let's go to the last match jerry cadaret versus george swedco love jerry kadaret
Zaur Payzulaev: I would like to see Tsvetkov win. Tsvetkov is very strong in the pronator, the bow is incredibly strong, that is, his hand is very good, he takes the brush, the hand is big, he takes the brush, the bow is good. But the minus is that there is no pressure, there is no pressure, he cannot press. And in this position, who is in the triceps, for him it is like an Achilles heel.
Zaur Payzulaev: That's it, he puts his hand on the mat, and it seems to me that there is not enough endurance. It is Cadorette who is the most uncomfortable opponent for him. Cadorette and Michael Todd are two such opponents who will be the most uncomfortable.
Zaur Payzulaev: Because he doesn't have a normal pressure. I think so. And, unfortunately, I would have liked to win against Chetkov, but I think he will win against Fezaretov. He will just beat him. He will get dirty in one round. Even if he loses in the first round, he will get dirty in the second round. And that's it. One round will load him and that's it. And that's the end.
Pavlo (Translator): okay yeah he he said i want to see this with golf winning because he have very strong hand very strong pronator very strong top row but he said uh that the upside pressure
Pavlo (Translator): yeah he said that he doesn't have that uh finish side finishing siding side and triceps pressure which is needed uh for cadarete and uh cadaret and uh he said that most likely cadaret will uh just uh take his endurance on the first round and maybe he will he will even lose that first round jerry cadaret but uh he said that he will he will take so much out of him that following rounds uh jerry will win
Engin Terzi: I understand, I understand. Another thing I want to ask you, how tall is Zaur? Zaur, how tall are you? 1.88 meters. 1.88 meters, right? It's 1.88 meters, which is like... So it's about 6'2". 6'2", yeah. Okay. I understand. Yeah. I also want to tell to the guys that, guys, we have trading cards.
Engin Terzi: It is just the credit card quality material. I think it's called Plexi card. And those trading cards will be on them. There are 30 pullers, but there will be 32 cards because two guys, Ferit and Kory, will have also left-arm cards, like two cards, right and left. And then we will have Prime, Dennis Ciplenko, and Prime, Travis Bashan.
Engin Terzi: and we will give in a nice wooden box if you are interested. Maybe one of the moderators would put in a chat room. Anyway, so Zaur, thank you very much for being part of it. And I hope to see you someday in Istanbul.
Engin Terzi: I wish you the best. And also, Paul, I thank you very, very much for this translation. As always, you are, I mean, doing a perfect job. I mean, it is not because only you are translating, but you are, as a person, you are a mature person and also very knowledgeable about arm wrestling. Also, yourself is world-level puller and your presence is always a big, big, big, big plus. Thank you very much, Paul.
Pavlo (Translator): Thank you, Engin. Let me translate. Thank you, Engin. Let me translate. Thank you, Engin. Let me translate. Thank you, Engin. Let me translate.
Engin Terzi: okay he said thank you very much and we will we will follow all the super matches yeah yeah one last thing one last thing uh uh when when devon saw dennis with alex kurdecha and devon said that dennis may be the number two guy in the world and then zaur
Engin Terzi: train with Dennis, even though Zaur just pulled a super match, not super match, a tournament two days before. But yesterday Devon said that Hermes has more chances against Zaur. And just a curiosity, how does he see himself against Devon Larratt?
Pavlo (Translator): Devon Larratt made a couple of comments there. First, when he saw Cyplenkov with Kurdech, he said, well, maybe Cyplenkov will be number two. Then he looked
Pavlo (Translator): Your practice with Denis, he says, well, in short, I don't know. Then he says that, like, Hermes probably has more chances against you, that he, maybe Hermes, has a little more chances to win. Engel asks, he says, what is your opinion, what do you think, if you fought with Larratt yourself? I think Larratt, I would be uncomfortable.
Zaur Payzulaev: Because he has such a technique, I noticed. In the first round, he tries to catch on a stretched arm. That's how he catches parts there. Waves it out. At the end, there is a little bit left. Here he is all poor there already.
Zaur Payzulaev: He holds it for a minute, like a blow. He is the most, most tenacious armwrestler in the world. I think he's tenacious. He can hold everyone. He drags his own water. Once he gets caught, that's it. That's it, he's caught. But I think it's the same with me. I just turned him over through the table. I don't see that he can catch me with this movement.
Zaur Payzulaev: I just push the explosive force, because I lose weight myself. That is, my weight and his weight, in what direction? I just analyze, I see how he fights. He also beat Prudnik, just in the first round, he takes, catches.
Zaur Payzulaev: I held it a little bit at the end. But Levan doesn't have such an explosive technique. He fights in a different way. He fights with strength there. And I'm more on speed and push.
Pavlo (Translator): yeah he said that uh yeah devon is probably the uh uh arm wrestler with the most endurance in the world and he said yeah he's uh trying to catch the athlete with uh his uh whatever straight arm or king's move near the pad he's struggling for a minute but then
Pavlo (Translator): When everybody is gassed out, then Devon is in his waters, you know, and then he's very comfortable. But he said, I don't see that happening with a possible match with me because my explosiveness and my mass, my body mass will not allow him to stop me somewhere near the pad. No, he sees that same outcome like Levon versus Devon.
Pavlo (Translator): His technique is different from Levan's technique because of the... No, no, no, the result, the same outcome. The same result. He will beat him all the way to the pad every time. Yeah, but is he not afraid that, you know, Devin may exhaust him even before the start? He says, well, maybe he says yes, but he says, what do you think, maybe it's because Devin will beat you, because Larratt will beat you even before the start?
Zaur Payzulaev: No, I'm not going to do it. He's trying to do it. No, I'm cold-blooded. I already have everything on the machine. Judicial arrest, rupture, everything. And I'm going to get my water.
Pavlo (Translator): yeah he said that's uh that's uh that's uh very unlikely because he said i already know that he's gonna try to do that and i i will say yeah old mind that i will go to the ref's grips sleep strap bed okay so he doesn't give chance okay i understand yeah anyways once again thank you paulo thank you zaur
Engin Terzi: As-salamu alaykum. Thank you everyone on the chat. Thank you guys. Thank you for watching. And tomorrow I will have Ali Can Muratov and Oleg Petrenko, hopefully. And then, yeah. Oh, Oleg Petrenko and Ali Can. Yeah, Paolo. Paolo, he's gone. Yeah, I need to reach him again. You take care, guys. You take care.
