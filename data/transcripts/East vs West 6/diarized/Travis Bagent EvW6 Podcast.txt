Engin Terzi: Tell me I'm the greatest. Would you honor our event by coming to Istanbul and being part of the crew? Let me think about it. I heard that you have some special powers that you can
Engin Terzi: even read the mind and then understand all the proposals one thing we do know is i can take power from people and give it to other people right we know that listen travis in less than five weeks you coming to istanbul are you not afraid to remind me those things
Engin Terzi: no no i know that's why i'm glad we're doing this thing on live listen you gotta know you have no remorse by any of that stuff here yeah so my memory is now uh erased till 2006. is that okay it was in 2005. nice okay okay
Travis Bagent: Hold his gun. Yeah, well, I can tell you that I am super excited to announce to the arm wrestling world that I will be in Istanbul, Turkey, working with the media staff and or whatever Ingen would like me to do between January 19th and January 21st. I will do my best to bring as much energy to the event as possible. And I'm super looking forward to it.
Engin Terzi: thank you for the invitation and um i'm looking forward to hanging out with everybody yeah it is it is our honor my friend to have you here and um you deserve to be here and um it is it's a plus for us you to be here and i really hope that
Engin Terzi: uh in when did we chat yesterday right you i am yeah you you joined artem and i yesterday and here we go okay the question did you change your mind since yesterday about
Travis Bagent: I did not. I feel more. I feel more. I feel more anxious to not compete now more than ever. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I will tell you this. I can't I ain't gonna let nobody keep eyeballing me over there either now.
Travis Bagent: What do you mean? If I see somebody looking at me like they don't think I'm the champ, I might step right up right then and there. After pool, before the competition, in the press conference. Just make sure that you know that I'm day to day if somebody looks at me. If Niazi looks at me a little bit weird and he wants to go at it. Or what about Dersif? Travis, we love you. You know, right?
Engin Terzi: will dorsen be there too under no i don't know i don't know okay i'll take a match with him too that's like the first today today today i talked with arthur morozo and he said that he would beat the out of you in april
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I need to start backing up with all that trash talking that I've been talking about those boys. I had no idea I was going to see him face to face here this early. So I'm super impressed. I can't wait to meet Ertem. I hope that he is...
Engin Terzi: as uh as amazing as it seems when i'm watching the video but uh yeah he's not in this card he's not in this he won't even come he won't be there as a guest i don't know we will see we will see okay listen listen you watch hermes gasparini versus arthur morozov with left arm yeah and i just want to ask
Engin Terzi: one second i first the super chat silky wilkie thank you my friend for your super chat get on the table travis we need you at the press conference that's what he said i have okay question just tell me 100 from your heart trust please you saw arthur morozov versus hermes what did you think about prime travis versus arthur morozov with left arm
Travis Bagent: not not very close i think i would yeah i would win pretty convincingly like even that initial drive that ermy had to compromise the hand and wrist i'm i would have been a little too much and um i would have won 3-0
Travis Bagent: pretty easy now the problem is is the next the next time that i would see artem in the time after that um but yeah the first time very susceptible to getting that hand taken um and i'm sure he's gonna get better and better as time goes on but um yeah that confidence the last one you saw artem was the
Engin Terzi: like the one that you think that you can conveniently beat him 3-0. We are not talking about February. We are talking about not even four weeks ago. So what I am just saying that that is the best that we could see till today. So that we are talking about, of course he may improve, but how much that is the thing, you know? And I want to have a, I want to have a,
Engin Terzi: conversation with you about about your future plans so we can talk about it. But people people says that arm wrestling leveled up so much. And so do you think this is the case? Or do you think this is the case only for maybe super heavyweight? Like people like Levan? But other than that, do you think that arm wrestling just
Travis Bagent: leveled up so much or you think that guys from like john is 58 years old i mean we see that you know he's just like i mean still where you know i mean top i believe that it is an absolute opinion and that it could change easily the more you involve yourself in arm wrestling so it probably has leveled up the problem is is as long as you still know the level
Travis Bagent: then we can all as human beings get there. As soon as someone benches 500 pounds, 30 other people started benching 500 pounds. The same with the four minute mile, all that stuff. So there's a chance LaVon maybe has taken it to some weird place, but if John is still in the top,
Travis Bagent: nine 12 that's where he's always been depending on what his weight was um so i mean i think there's a good argument if i if i was arm wrestling a lot right now i would tell you that they've leveled up since i'm half semi-retired i'm telling you that it ain't as good as it was back then
Travis Bagent: that's because it's all personal how would i if it's leveled up to a crazy place then how can a guy like me get back in it wouldn't it be way safer for my brain even if it is leveled up to pretend it's not and to um and to know that you know i'm just a few months away from i mean listen i know i'm a few months away from being
Travis Bagent: The last match, the third to the last match, I mean, most of these guys ain't really that good. I mean, so, you know, I don't think it would take much for me to have a war with guys like Reza and Prudnik and those guys. Whether you could ever beat LeVon, you know, maybe, maybe not. I got to see LeVon. I got to touch him.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, the thing is, Chance Shaw and you, you get along? Yeah, I guess. I mean, I like him. I like him. Okay, but you may not like him after I read you his comments. Yeah, but that's okay. Yeah, listen, Chance Shaw has taken a lot of abuse by me verbally. I'm sure that he has some things. First comment he said, there is one bomb
Travis Bagent: and one legend in this show maybe he called me bomb maybe he called you but i wasn't sure until i saw the second one he said listen here's what we do here's what we're doing hold on when we get to turkey and me and you and chance are together yeah us three and we're in this room together let's ask him which one he caught a bump
Travis Bagent: He'll tell us. He'll tell us. In Turkey, he's not going to call me one person. I mean, so then he's going to call me a bum, and we should videotape that, but make sure that he says it to my face. I want to hear that. Maybe he's joking. Anyway, so he says, so is it Brandon El Cesar bigger than Travis, and Travis is bigger than Arthur Morozov?
Travis Bagent: So he is messing with you. Yeah, no doubt. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure. Listen, man, chance to get chance every once in a while. I will say something that I'm sure if you're in chances camp, it ain't cool. So I love chance. I have no problem. Chance is good. What would you say negative about him? People very good with John, people very good with Pat Hutchings and
Engin Terzi: He didn't pull bad against Andres. These are all really high-level athletes, and he beat Zurab, and then he beat just beat the...
Travis Bagent: bj bj he just beat yeah bj his name yeah the chance is real good you know i agree i there's no doubt that he is good but he has also lives in florida and every time i say something about him artem gets all crazy so it's just the way it is you know i mean i i have no problems with chan shaw i think that besides corey west he's probably him there corey west probably the future of
Engin Terzi: american heavyweight arm wrestling no problem bronze people he says thank you for your super chat hello ending can you ask travis if he agrees that devon is top three in super heavyweight still today
Travis Bagent: Yes, I think so. Only recently with John Brzenk giving me the feedback that yes, in fact, Devin is at another level that John was even surprised at. So I also understand why there's five other guys that think they can still beat Devin that are in the top 10. I have no problem with them thinking that because they very well should think that.
Travis Bagent: I mean, you think that, I believe you think Genadi, you think Hermes, you think Morozov, you think Rivas, you think Levon, and probably three, four others. You could think that if you're in their camp or you're their trainer, you want them to think they can be Devils. I mean, yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I mean, Farid would love to pull, I believe, Devin left or right-handed right now and see what his chances are. And I bet you that. You know what I think about Devin? Do you know what I think about Devin? I cannot, like, Devin that pull Levan in Dubai may very well be the second place guy in the world.
Engin Terzi: I can only say this, if Devon is heavy enough, he has chance to beat anyone on this search. How much chance? I don't know, 50%, 60%, whatever. But except Levan, I think he has chance to beat. Nobody can say that this guy would 100% or like he would beat Devon for sure. There is nothing like that. But there are some other guys that may also beat him. But
Engin Terzi: one that i saw in dubai was a dangerous one and and that is why lebanon also said that you know i mean people you know how it is travis i don't know if follow or not there are there are like some people like to the death you know they are like devon haters and then they are the ones then they they like almost like worship him of course the majority is not like the majority is even it's devon fan
Engin Terzi: He can talk, you know, like say that this yes, this no, he can say. But there are some things that one side is 100% hater, the other side is 100% sporter. I know a lot, Ingen, about the haters.
Travis Bagent: I know that Devin now from a social media standpoint has taken what I probably went through 10 years ago on the Northeast board at another level. But yeah, I agree with that. But, and I too in the past have been more of a Devin hater
Engin Terzi: and without john berzink's reference i probably would still think that there were 15 guys that would like that opportunity but the real is there's only a couple dudes that want to mess with that guy yeah yeah yeah yeah i i can say that there are three four or five guys that can be dangerous for devon and then we can be dangerous for them yeah yeah but that is what i think about how lady gets too
Engin Terzi: how light he is. The lighter he gets, the more people. The lighter he gets, it's becoming near impossible, you know. Like maybe 105 kilo John, 105 kilo Devon, you know, same weight, or 105 kilo Prudnik versus 105, not 115, because
Engin Terzi: Brittany just push himself to be 114 15. While probably next day, Devon was over 120 kilo in the evening, you know? Yeah. So yeah, so the category gets like between 105 115. The guy is very heavily favorites against anyone on the surf, you go 105, he may be getting a little bit weaker.
Travis Bagent: understand and then then maybe someone like ongar webb you know you know or john or even even the big guys like rebus and michael todd they don't want they don't want to pull devon if the weight's unlimited but if they run into the devon that is trying to make weight with prudik that's when there's just a few other people and how about dennis where are we at with him
Engin Terzi: I mean, Dennis, I don't know, Dennis is coming back. You know, Dennis is going to pull John. I mean, my honest opinion, I would no disrespect to anyone. Normally, because he is just making a comeback, I would just say like this.
Engin Terzi: But after I saw him after pool, did you see him with Alex Kurdesha after pool? Yeah, it looked real easy. I mean, Alex Kurdesha is a very, very, very, very strong guy. Problem, he's a problem. Alex Kurdesha is a very strong guy. And I don't think that Dennis is even ready to compete. So if he is like this in November and then February, I am expecting Dennis to be,
Engin Terzi: much stronger. That's just my opinion. That guy, I kind of think that if he comes, if Dennis comes back as strong as before, just say one and a half year later, if he tries to hook Levan like this, he will lose for sure. But his new style, that way, like rolling his elbow, the open arm top roll, I still give
Engin Terzi: big chance to live on just say 70 but there is a some percentage of possibility that when leon is going he may be stuck there you know yeah yeah yeah the place is going to go crazy if that happens um
Engin Terzi: I mean, it would be good. I think that Dennis Dennis should go slowly, my friend slowly, he should just go, john, if he can be john, we don't know if he can because john, you can underestimate you know, you're talking about john, you know, I mean, after I, I saw only petrenko left arm. And then I said, I said to my friends that, you know, I'm the biggest john Penn, but I think he will get destroyed, you know. And
Engin Terzi: Yeah, that night, last month. But he just does it, you know. Yeah, come on, Travis, I will tell you something. I think that Devin's visit to John's house
Travis Bagent: Yeah, was eye opening to John to that. Hey, whatever I'm doing, whatever my method is, I need to step up a little bit. And I bet you it helped because John's not the type of guy to just allow things to be the way they are. You're talking about a human being that is capable of tremendously more than what meets the eye. And without knowing that Devon had taken that step,
Travis Bagent: You know, once John has that information, he's a different person. So that could have been why, you know, guys, you know, why it was a little bit of surprising. And I think that don't be surprised if John clicks a couple more times just because he knows that it's needed. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dark Armor, thank you for your support, my friend.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I think I think it will be. It will be incredible and I think that very bright future. Is waiting. For community or outlets, you know, I think that I think that we are finally coming. We are still far, but we're getting closer and closer to where we. Deserved to be. Do you agree that Travis? I mean, this is definitely the first.
Travis Bagent: time that we have reached altitude that actually, I mean, like you said, it's like we cleared like the first layer of clouds.
Travis Bagent: that no one usually gets to. So, um, you definitely have a tremendous opportunity and it seems like the world is, um, pretty sold. Um, so that's awesome. At least the entire arm wrestling world, to me, I'm sure you're still getting some, some hater mail, but from the outside where I, my perspective, I don't see a ton of haters. Um, and usually that's a difficult task to overcome too.
Engin Terzi: I understand. I understand. As long as listen, I mean, of course, it bothers me. I have thin skin, but I care more about the people whom I respect. You understand? I listen to you, what you say. I listen to John, what he says. I listen to Devon, what he says. I listen to Levan, what he says. You understand? Or many others. It doesn't have to be like the most popular guys. If community in general is supporting,
Engin Terzi: I continue, understand? I will do my best. That is my motivation. Money is important. For you, it's more important. For me, it's less important. Important, but for me, it's like more is important. The motivation that is coming from these people, they are like, okay, let's go and do it all together. By the way, there will be some... Prime Travis is old news. Today's Travis loses to Gabi, Chen Xiao says.
Travis Bagent: Does Chanchal have a job or a girlfriend or somewhere else he could be right now? No, he's a friend of yours. Chanchal, he should get his GED. He should not be messing with us. I mean, oh, okay, maybe he joined the chat late. Maybe he didn't hear the beginning of the chat. That's why he's talking like that. He didn't hear me apologize. Chanchal.
Engin Terzi: I was is coming to January events, I just bought his tickets, I just bought this ticket, so you be careful about what you're saying right now. hey chance i'm gonna see you me you and then go be in a phone booth and you don't tell us which ones above. yeah yeah Travis is that Travis Travis is people may not know.
Engin Terzi: but what is okay 10 years ago 15 years ago we were smaller smaller like community was smaller and but what is like today like devon is 15 years ago 16 years ago it was travis agree do you agree that i mean about the popularity popularity
Engin Terzi: oh even five years ago okay you know better you know after like 2013 or something i stopped following oh man are you telling me you don't remember man no no five years ago i i was just like i i start to come back after pandemic that that's why people think that i'm new or some some people think that way the other day other day someone who i just checked his profile with 1 190 subscribers he said that
Engin Terzi: i should be thankful to him and people like that because they made me who i am today he told me this and i was like i i i don't know you i don't even know you you know who are you i mean just yeah because they also think that i'm new one yeah um he said the chain show says that penguin that is perfect now i can take him in person continuously
Travis Bagent: I don't know what that means. I don't know. Yeah, we're going to find out. We're going to find out exactly where you're going to take me when you look at my face and tell me that Engin's a legend and I'm a bum. I cannot wait until that second. I hope you're at the airport. Travis, you still will be in Istanbul just
Travis Bagent: yeah right at the press conference i will bring the mic right over the chance and say uh who's the bomb and then right here you you say it and if he says it you are the bomb travis he's gonna say no he's gonna say i was talking about it again somebody's gonna kill him off with his head and it's gone
Engin Terzi: I love it. I love it. I love it. Who is Chance Armwrestling? Oh, Chance Armwrestling, the training partner of Levon Saginashvili. Okay. David Arabuli. David Arabuli. Who is David Arabuli? David Arabuli is someone around Sandri's level. So ask him if I can be in his corner against Chance Shaw.
Travis Bagent: I will massage, I'll do the massage, you know, the arm like that. See, see, Chance still says, I will tell you the world, you are a bum. That's two, that's twice, that's twice. That's two times. I can't, if I come to Istanbul and strike three, if I hear strike three, it's on, it is on.
Travis Bagent: What's on? I have two strikes. That's two strikes on chance. That's two bums. Nobody ever, I've never been to a third bum ever. No, I like Chance, man. I know Chance knows that I'm not really his daddy. I'm just kind of his daddy. So he's trying to get over that. I think that you guys are just teasing each other. I'm 100% sure that as a young, you know,
Engin Terzi: rising star you respect him and i'm sure that as a legend
Engin Terzi: you are, that he also respects you, that that's what it is. I mean, listen, yeah, we have a we have a unique relationship. I love Chance, so it's all good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He also said the same thing, like love or something. But I don't I don't tell you that. It's hard to mix in that. It's hard to mix in when you see BUM in Latin, when the word BUM is in capital letters. It's hard to miss it in the whole thing. I got you. I got you.
Travis Bagent: we'll see uh is there alcohol will there be alcohol in in turkey when you know in the when you know in istanbul they have it why you need that okay i'm saying because after i have two shots then i'm gonna have a chance again to call me a vote one more time one more time ah i love it in in in the venue we don't allow but
Engin Terzi: Outside, it's all up to you. In the competition, we don't want to. Yeah, it'd be fun. I'm going to walk in anyway. No drinking, just walking. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really, it will be good. As I told you in your program with Ertem, there is a missing part with this big arm missing puzzle, and that was you. And I'm very happy that you're coming back. And I support you 100%.
Engin Terzi: not like I support you against a specific person, but I support your comeback, you know, and I really can't wait, you know, seriously. And I'm 100% sure that there are a lot of people like me, because people are kind of tired of you having that wind
Travis Bagent: with the what you did from like years years years ago so it is history again deprived it's called you have been deprived and arm wrestling though interesting is not the same without its most prized possession ladies and gentlemen you are welcome the beast is back yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean
Engin Terzi: you guys you watch from the most of you watch from the videos but in mid 2000s you know he was literally after beating his opponent on the stage and making people get up and tell him that he's great we're gonna we're gonna do a great thing there at the press conference i got it all planned out for you i'll run it by you first whatever you talk make sure to back up
Engin Terzi: hundred percent no problem i already know i'm gonna have to walk on eggshells over there so i mean back your words when i said back up i don't know if i said the wrong right word but yeah i got you yeah okay yeah yeah yeah it'll be fun but i i need to talk with you privately yeah yeah we can talk and then probably have all kinds of rules and regulations that i gotta find by
Engin Terzi: no no no no no no no that's not about that it's about most like you know your participation as an athlete okay yeah yeah anyways yeah of course me too me too me too uh engine what does it need for travis to be top five in the world again mark meyer he only needs to want
Engin Terzi: that is all i have to do is want it that's all i got and listen top five i don't like i mean listen i'm either the champ or i'm coming for the champ i'm the champ or i'm coming for the champ i don't know i don't know like travis with me you have all the credits as long as you come here prepared that is why i give you
Travis Bagent: this much guarantee this month january this month this month for winning april this much for winning i don't want to you know who did that what so igor mezarenko tells me that he'll give me um you know thirty five hundred dollars to arm wrestle uh alexey bovoda left-handed
Travis Bagent: And then two days later, he says, if you arm wrestle Pushkar right-handed, I'll pay you another two grand. And I'm like, man, are you crazy? You at least got to pay the same 3,500. He said, no, no, Vovoda's bigger name is for championship. Pushkar is still the number two contender. You beat him, you get to, you know, right-handed, whatever. So I'm like, ah, man, I don't think I can do it. I said, I'll tell you what, what's the bonus for busting both of them?
Travis Bagent: He said, Travis, I'll give you $5,000 to come pull them and $5,000 if you beat them both. Yeah, I saw. That's why I had to beat them both. Same deal in Dubai. People ask me, why would you false start and manipulate the grip against Farid?
Travis Bagent: Because I had already beat Andre and I knew I was going after that $10,000 bonus. I'll do anything. I will do anything to win. Ferit is still burning with the revenge fire. Make sure you take care of that, man. Tell Ferit that I cannot wait to see him. I love him. He will be there in Istanbul. 310 pounds.
Engin Terzi: no doubt and i will have a box of cigars for ferry yeah you you you never beat him right arm though you know right he beat you both ever just we only pulled one time right no he beat you one in vegas one in zloty i don't know if you beat him in overall or not but
Travis Bagent: I did it. I did it. Yeah, he did win that. He's 2-0. The only good thing is he ended up losing to Pushkar, and then I ended up winning the overall. That was sick. Yeah. He and Pushkar killed each other. Pushkar and him. In the same event, he also beat John.
Travis Bagent: Yeah. And, but you know what, if you replay both of those, there were some starts with both of those guys where all three of us were pretty close that day. Like even, but the thing is, is when a guy wins the early match,
Travis Bagent: I believe that that gives him more credit than at the end when there's all kinds of problems. And once I realized that those two were going to have to pull possibly again in that overall, it was pretty easy to make that decision, you know, and not be afraid to go from the losers bracket. I mean, John and I split all that money for that entire event. We needed to win that overall in order to make that trip profitable.
Engin Terzi: I understand. Anyway, so this is I have 20 minutes to join another one. And Travis, thank you very much for accepting my offer to come again. You are an important factor for our sport. And I'm very, very happy that you're making a comeback. Can't wait to see you. Nice. Let me know, too. I need to know all my responsibilities.
Engin Terzi: mean you want me to ref commentate i i i remember your your your your uh comment or just your answer message you said yes yes i will make you do all of them let's go if you want to buy the t-shirts travis's signature will be on that too yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: all right that sounds good are we done oh chance a very good offer for you before we close he said i heard travis's travis is moving to florida after his son gets drafted by the jacks and he said chan show is gonna give you a discount on his training program
Travis Bagent: what is chance's program what is chance's program he will teach you arm lesson oh okay no problem well listen chance you better tell him hey the second practice you in trouble the second practice you ain't going to invite me back for the third one and then he will be losing his wrist right oh no listen man here's the problem with chance shaw is that he's too young
Travis Bagent: too young right now i he don't want to see me at practice i'll have that man it'd be too insecure after he leaves yeah you know how i grip them you know how i grip them they ain't never happy they're never happy when they get that that connection with the beast but listen chance y'all all jokes aside
Travis Bagent: Your ass is grass. As soon as I start climbing, I'm going to beat up people like you on the way to the fight. Just remember that. And it's going to be painful from a verbal, emotional standpoint because of the way that you kind of decided the best thing to do when I say something crazy is smirk.
Travis Bagent: but you already like to type and all that. So just remember that on my way up there, trust me, I didn't come to this thing to beat you, right? I'm coming to beat the dude. You just happen to be a little, a placemat. And I appreciate the fact that you understand from a marketing standpoint,
Travis Bagent: that being in any sort of verbal confrontation with me is good for your YouTube channel. Just remember that it's painful three or four rounds when I start talking. Once I start talking, it's a problem. Yeah. Silky, milky. But listen, I started to see someone from years ago again, someone competitive, not like someone is
Engin Terzi: in a sleeping mode you know yeah you you are now again you are like that's that first hey that's that first trt treatment we got last week kick it in right now yeah silky wilkie says welcome back travis we'll see you soon he says yeah anyways guys thank you very much for being part of it
Engin Terzi: and alaikum salam ta and hope to see you guys again with another live tomorrow i have jerry cadoret and george swedco for the live podcast
Travis Bagent: Ask Georgi, look in Georgi's face and ask him, have you changed some things up? Or are you taking the same situation into the Jerry match? No, no, he's training different. Yeah. But you know what? Stylistically, it's bad for Georgi. But...
Travis Bagent: This is stylistically, but generally, what do you think about Georgi when he is in his best form? What do you think about that? Listen, I saw Georgi. First of all, when I got to Moldova, when I arm wrestled Georgi left-handed, that could have been the best shape of my whole entire life.
Travis Bagent: If you look at my body, the fat, the muscle, weight ratio, I was an absolute, listen, I have never been paid as much as I was to do those two Moldova events.
Travis Bagent: so you must know in that seven months the first yeah yeah but you know that match was originally set for right arm no doubt i'm telling you that i got ready for about 11 weeks as hard as i could both hands and then had that problem with saving and when i got there left-handed i'm just telling you that i was awesome and i watched georgie beat ferret
Travis Bagent: um saving john brzenk every one of those guys he beat easily right and left-handed right after we got done and it was impressive so i'm not telling you that his left hand was ready for that match but i'm telling you his left hand was the second best left hand in the building okay i understand a question for you
Travis Bagent: if you are not injured did he have a chance to beat you right on oh yes he had a better chance after what he told me that of course you know the thing with saban was interesting because saban was at our at our house for 10 days i probably arm wrestled saban about 42 times before we got to that competition because we were training the whole week we traveled together me him and ryan and
Travis Bagent: whatever happens that injury but i also believe that if ryan's not refereeing and there is a certified set gripping referee that saban 2 can't find my hand and he is done 3-0 it was only ryan tap tap turn turn and then said go out of nowhere that i got caught in that hook in round two but the truth is is saban
Engin Terzi: from what I heard was not as strong as Georgi at that time. So yeah, it was clearly, yeah, clearly that Georgi had an extremely good chance. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chance show, I say the last message and we go, he said that Travis is too far behind me in arm wrestling, so I may as well, no, yeah, I may as well challenge him in something else.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, like a fist fight after you call me a bum one more time. That's it, that's a bare knuckles, boom, boom, boom. That's what the hell we get ready to do. The next time I hear that word bum ever come out of your mouth and I can see your mouth.
Engin Terzi: not in istanbul that's perfect you guys will get in trouble in istanbul doing that yeah don't worry i'm not i'm good yeah yeah okay anyways thank you very much travis once again and then talk to you later and then all right man we make plans okay thank you everyone who watched us and see you tomorrow with another life you're the man yeah you too
