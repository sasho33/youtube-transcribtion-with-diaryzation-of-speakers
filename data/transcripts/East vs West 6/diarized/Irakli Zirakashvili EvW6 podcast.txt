Engin Terzi: Hello guys. Hello, hello. Is it possible that you turn the camera sideways so?
Engin Terzi: Hello Victor, hello Engin Turbo, Andrew. Hello, music editor. Hello, Jake Linn. Good evening, Richard. Good afternoon. Thank you, my friends. Same to you and your family. Hello, I love AOC. They're way more interesting than
Engin Terzi: Okay. Hello, Brian. So, I won't be able to chat with you guys so much. I will be more concentrated on our guests. So, okay. Anyways. So, hello, Irakli. Hello, David. Hello. So, how is everything? Good, good. Very good. Good. I'm happy to hear that, yeah.
Engin Terzi: So normally we could do this as two guests. David Arabuli is also part of the West versus West six. He will pull Chance Shaw. But now let this be about Irakli and then maybe you and Chance at the same time you'll be my guest, David. Yeah, it will be good. Yeah, it will be good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so how is everything going directly? You are almost ready? Yes, yes, yes. All is going good and soon he will be ready for all. Okay, okay, that's good, that's good. And what did you think about
Engin Terzi: john's uh statement about like your destiny is already written and he says that you know like he means that you're gonna lose you know it's already a known fact can you ask david what did he think about this johnny
Irakli Zirakashvili: Well, you know, Santukhar was the one who said that everything was under my control, and I think that there is no such thing as control in the book when you read it. As the legend says, but for me, it's not as bad as I said, there is no such thing as control in the book.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yeah, that's what's on right for their match.
Irakli Zirakashvili: and he respects him too much. There is another thing that only experience is not really enough to win with Irakli and he thinks that he will not have enough power, that experience was enough for him. He respects him one more time, just early to talk about the predictions, that is not good for him.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so he's saying that he has so much respect for him, but he's saying that John is not good about the prediction that he has and Iraqi is probably saying that he's going to beat him. Yes, yes, thank you.
Irakli Zirakashvili: I think that John's prediction is not correct. All the experience is not enough for his power. That's all. But does he think that his power is much more than John's power? Yes, of course.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yeah, okay, okay. He's young. He's young. That is all. That is enough. Yeah, Petrenko was young as well, but... Petrenko's style is very similar to mine. John Sikmiadzo, Petrenko, Sadatsko, Lazieri, and John.
Irakli Zirakashvili: uh style of peter corey style of your act is so different difference and style petrenko is what's need john you know he he attacked with john where he's john plus and uh his uh style is the difference with peter yeah yeah no i know i know that i know but what i'm just saying that sometimes the age alone may not be because he said he's young you know it is not always
Engin Terzi: enough either like experience is not enough and then sometimes being young is not enough but i think that john now had a stem cell therapy for his injuries you know and then i don't know maybe he will he will feel stronger this event
Engin Terzi: yeah all is possible um you know he was very confident uh tell him that i i will be like pure uh open with him you understand and so i want to yeah he was he was confident against takashi as well and now he's confident against john and uh
Engin Terzi: what has been changed since that time to now.
Irakli Zirakashvili: David you have a relationship with Tordzila? I had a relationship with Tordzila. I had a relationship with Tordzila. I had a relationship with Tordzila. I had a relationship with Tordzila. I had a relationship with Tordzila. I had a relationship with Tordzila.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yeah, you know, there's one thing that after when he lose with Tozilla,
Irakli Zirakashvili: all talk about that sirocco is so weak or something like this but he he changed you think that he changed because after the tozilla he didn't lose any matches and he read like barbosa and he did not think that's barbosa is weak sportsman or something like this but after that the the meanings are same that's all the talking that seals with tozilla but
Irakli Zirakashvili: noah talking about his winning matches and he had some problem technically or physically and he think that this problem is denied and he is the better shape and he feel better of course and this is their much his matches is accept this yeah yeah yeah and and does he does he um i would say
Engin Terzi: Like, does he feel like whatever he has is already enough for John? Or does he feel like he needs to, I would say, a specific way of pulling for John? Yeah, that's a good question. I think John is right. But I don't think there is a specific way of pulling for John.
Irakli Zirakashvili: I think that John Stromogo was very much like John Z. I think that he was very much like John Z. I think that John Stromogo was very much like John Z.
Irakli Zirakashvili: He thinks that there is no correct way to think some specific ways for John because you can't win with John with experience or some another way. Just think that he has the same style, like correct style, and just he needs more power. And there is only one way. Just be stronger than John and have correct style. And he has this both. So he's saying that
Engin Terzi: His style, naturally, is good for Jones' style. He will think for another ways, he will lose. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I understand, I understand. And what is his weight right now?
Engin Terzi: 107 kg 107 yeah okay 107. and uh what was his weight when we last time saw him against uh krasimir 93 93 yeah yes
Irakli Zirakashvili: Like his natural weight with the like with food and with what he dressed it was 93 kg. Okay so he is now 14 kilo heavier than the time that we saw him against Krasimir.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Before the preparing he was 99.
Irakli Zirakashvili: like before the now preparing and after that she gained 7 kg 7 8 kg and he feel good now there is comfort comfortable weight for him and he think that she will join maybe more 3 kg but after the training he will lose maybe 105 his natural weights on the competition okay but uh
Engin Terzi: his weight is heavier and does he see the same difference with the weights that he is lifting? Or he sees the difference at the table? Like the weights that he is lifting are also increasing or
Irakli Zirakashvili: He doesn't focus on that one. He focuses mostly on the table. What is his strategy?
Irakli Zirakashvili: He thinks that before now he is training too hard and now he is working on the table to use this power correctly.
Irakli Zirakashvili: training is important training is important but he now is focusing on the table so he's saying that he trained he get the inner force power now he transfer that power to the table
Irakli Zirakashvili: like now in georgia like in the world he's really like power no only i and leon and uh
Engin Terzi: leon talk about how he progressed last two or three months and uh all world will see his uh which shape he's now yeah yeah and he he has good good and who does he train with like at the table which have daughters like this david and leon oh leon and david okay yeah yeah and and david what's your rate
David Arabuli: 120 I am now. And how is your shape? Like I feel well, like I training too hard, like last four years, maybe I training too hard and I'm in the shape where I have never have been early like this. I understand. I understand. Yeah, we will talk about it.
Engin Terzi: in another program chance here now now we are focusing for him yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's good that's good yeah and yeah and um it actually looks like you will be around this weight uh time to time do you want to also pull in 115 kg or only you are only focused for the 105 kilo right now
Irakli Zirakashvili: Do you think it's possible to do it in 2015? No, I don't think so. I think it's possible to do it in 2015. I think it's possible to do it in 2015.
Irakli Zirakashvili: like you think that his body have the resources to be on that way to be like one of one of the not one of the best or best of 150 kg before like on the next year so but but next year he wants to be at the 115 kg it means like 2023 or yeah this year yeah yeah yeah yeah
Irakli Zirakashvili: So he wants to pull in like two categories, sometimes there, sometimes there?
Irakli Zirakashvili: uh if if there will be some interesting uh opponents for him prudnik or someone he will accept all the matches there is no problem which category will be this what are the interesting guys for him who will be who will be the best
Engin Terzi: on the trade category the best is there so so if he if he beats john who does he want next to just forget
Irakli Zirakashvili: uh the the sportsman who is the best in the 105k category like he did not think he did not think like some concretely uh names he need to pull with the best if uh on that time will be the best kiddie valley he will he he wants uh okay right now
Engin Terzi: There are four guys, two matches in January about that category, John versus Irakli, and the title match is Ongarbaev versus Michael Todd. So first of all, I would like to ask him, what does he think about Ongarbaev versus Michael?
Irakli Zirakashvili: It's very interesting, it's very interesting, it's very interesting, it's very interesting, it's very interesting, it's very interesting, it's very interesting, it's very interesting,
Irakli Zirakashvili: He thinks that's really like his legend. He's a great sportsman. He has respect to Todd.
Irakli Zirakashvili: and he thinks he has some problem or this problem is his age or Trump's or something like this but he thinks that he has not the same power
Irakli Zirakashvili: uh which he had early because he was beating more stronger guys than now and last some matches he have not shown himself so well but this is normal if he will pull this this category with our kidder valley he will win
Irakli Zirakashvili: because the opponent was heavier last opponent his last offensive was heavier and he's now 105 kg and he thinks that's todd will win or he thinks that todd is going to beat on that way yes yes and how should we see about this prediction
Irakli Zirakashvili: uh like he did not think that this is 100 but just he's he has this production in mind and and if he beats john so it means that he wants to pull michael next to jones he needs the winner between them i understand
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but but so he this is why I'm asking it because he thinks he's gonna be John. And he thinks Michael is gonna be on guard where so automatically he's thinking that he's gonna face my microphone. Okay, I understand. I understand.
Engin Terzi: And after he, if he wins, you know, like if his dream is to win the, not the dream, but his target goal to win the title, it means that after that, then he wants to pull Devon in 115 kg. Yeah. Yes, yes.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yeah, that is correct. I understand. Like in the last of 2023, he thinks it will happen. And does he think that he can beat? What is his chance at the end of 2023 against Devon? How does he think? What does he think about Devon? I don't know.
Irakli Zirakashvili: I think he thinks that he needs to train hard. That's what he has in mind to take what he needs. But he realizes that Devon is a strong opponent, probably if especially Levon said that
Engin Terzi: Devon is the second place guy in his opinion. Not that Devon at this weight, but probably that Devon that he faced, Devon facing Dubai, according to Levan was the second guy, you know, is the second guy in the world. So probably it actually has a good information about Devon from Levan. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: yes yes right some people here they call uh iraqi mark iraq is delusional my friend you can not be at this level that iraqi is and not to dream about becoming number one it is not being delusional my friend it is
Engin Terzi: possible or not possible, but when you are at that level that, of course, you are going to target and, especially if you are very young is this very normal that you're going to target you know. Beating the the the best guy you know that's very natural my friend. Anyway, so. that's nice.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Like, for example, I was 16 years old. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Irakli Zirakashvili: I think that there is nothing more important in sports than the fact that my father, who died a long time ago,
Irakli Zirakashvili: John and Larratt are legends, and I don't want to say that I'm not a fan of them, but I do want to say that I'm a fan of John's songs. And all of this is because we are all in the same world, and there is nothing we can't do.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yeah, Irakli wants to say that in sport nothing is impossible, you know, because when he started armwrestling, Lara Stone was already a legend, you know,
Irakli Zirakashvili: think and recognize that that's uh maybe sometimes you will meet them like physically and there was not thinking about matches or something like this but now there is time that he have much with john and for this he is thankful for you because you give him this chance and uh
Irakli Zirakashvili: Just he wants to say that if you have some goals and you want to work for this, impossible is nothing. Yes, I agree. I agree. I was 16 years old. I couldn't beat my sister, my mother in armwrestling. And I wanted to become a world champion.
Engin Terzi: I was probably delusional for many people, but I became. So every time you want to do something more, people will think that you cannot. Maybe you cannot, but there is nothing more normal than dreaming and working hard as long as you pay the price for that. That's why I think that it is normal. And there is a question.
Engin Terzi: I mean, of course, I mean, we need to, we need to really encourage, you know, this, this newcomers, you know, you know, whenever I look at arm wrestling, I mean, we all, how to say, we all are from a nation. We all are from a nation that, you know,
Engin Terzi: automatically, you know, we support, you know, but we need to be happy when we see the newcomers are coming, new stars, future stars, future legends are arising. I mean, we should be happy no matter where they are from, you know, because, you know, John Brzee is from the United States and he is the hero of, I can say that 99.9% of the
Engin Terzi: people from all different countries. And so, Iraq now is there, Ermes is there, you know, the many Morozov is rising, you know, just, it's just, I'm happy that these people are coming. And we will see, we will see how it will be. Okay, so
Engin Terzi: We talk about it. So you are saying that your short term goal is to win 105 kg category at the West versus West. And then middle term, I can say that beat Devon and win the also the heavyweight title. Yeah. And do you think that your style is more effective against Devon?
Irakli Zirakashvili: than Prudnik's style against Devon. Physically, Devon has too long hand for that style, like how Prudnik wants to win Devon.
Engin Terzi: say again sorry about it like they won't have too long hand for that style how prudnik want to win devon so basically he's saying that his style is more effective against devon yeah yeah yeah of course i understand yeah so so if we go forward
Engin Terzi: People are asking me that I should invite John. I already invited John, but John wasn't available. I will also do a different podcast with John and maybe at the end I can invite both guys. But this is also good that these athletes can express themselves better when they have more time.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Erati, is this your like dream match? At least one of the dream matches? Yes, yes.
Irakli Zirakashvili: uh for his age he think that's more big matches and better matches and better concrete he did not like think about it like he's the best chance for him and this is the best opponent for him
Irakli Zirakashvili: He respects to my John. I think that's
Irakli Zirakashvili: uh what john does enormously most of the sportsmen if he will do half of them this is the big thing for him yeah yeah yeah i agree um the question his respect for john will affect his performance in negative way
Irakli Zirakashvili: Is there anything else you want to say? No, I don't want to say anything. It's a sport, I'm a man of my word, I have my own opinions, but with Magida, everything works out and it will be great. It's a sport.
Irakli Zirakashvili: this is the sport and disrespect and he think that all is and other things like disrespect and other things but when they will be in the table all of this will differently and there will be war for winning yeah yeah so he is so dedicated about fulfilling his
Engin Terzi: dreams and like and john is now on his way and he will be i'll say so determined to the win like he will not be like the respect will not affect him that's what i understand yeah
Irakli Zirakashvili: I think it's important for me to be able to do what I want to do. I think it's important for me to be able to do what I want to do. I think it's important for me to be able to do what I want to do. I think it's important for me to do what I want to do.
Irakli Zirakashvili: yeah like he he's first thing that's he have goals and there is no means who will be his opponent on this time there is the first thing what's you think i understand yeah um another thing i know that he changed his style more he is now arm wrestling more and more
Engin Terzi: probably going a little bit more sideways instead of pulling back after Tatachink's match. And stylistically, not about power, stylistically, is John harder or easier opponent than Tatachink's? I'm not talking about power, just the way the style, you know, that they are pulling in.
Irakli Zirakashvili: I don't think you will be able to do it. I think you will be able to do it. I think you will be able to do it. I think you will be able to do it. I think you will be able to do it. I think you will be able to do it. I think you will be able to do it. I think you will be able to do it.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Like, no, I think that John's style is not easy for him than Totsila. I think that style, John is more difficult than Totsila. Yes, he lose with Totsila, but style, John have difference and the best, maybe. No, no, I mean, I'm not comparing if John is better armwrestler or if Todd, but, you know, when you take Todd's wrist,
Engin Terzi: Todd will still rest like this so strong. I mean, I don't know if that will be the case if he takes. I don't know if if somehow Iraq we can take Jones risk. I'm not sure if John can be as effective as I know, John Campbell this way as well. But I'm not sure it can be as effective as Todd's in that position. So that is is why I was thinking.
Engin Terzi: and in my opinion it is very important in this match that iraqi's hand and wrist here because he already has here very strong so in my opinion iraqi's hand finger wrist you know this this will be the key for his result uh does he think same or differently what does he think okay i will ask him one more time
Irakli Zirakashvili: I don't know if it will be possible to do it in the future, but I think it will be possible in the future. I don't know if it will be possible in the future, but I think it will be possible in the future. I don't know if it will be possible in the future, but I think it will be possible in the future. I don't know if it will be possible in the future, but I think it will be possible in the future.
Irakli Zirakashvili: I think that the situation is very difficult. I mean, if the situation is difficult, it is natural for us to know what to do. Of course, the situation is difficult for me, but I don't want to be in such a situation where I am alone.
Irakli Zirakashvili: He thinks that the key for John is to take his wrist.
Irakli Zirakashvili: But this is too difficult, you know, this situation when someone will take John's wrist. And for Tozilla, like there is too much people who take Tozilla's wrist, you know. And for that time when he meet with Tozilla, he have not enough situation and hence preparing to win him.
Irakli Zirakashvili: but uh for the technically john have a more problematically technique for him than taji i understand and you think that's like if he will take john's wrists he will win 100 percent that's what i meant to say you know like once once you put john to that position your chance is more
Engin Terzi: then when you put Todd to that position, you know, you can put Todd to this position still may not be enough. And that's what I wanted to say.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yes, just like this is problem which he had for that situation.
Irakli Zirakashvili: just he like just denied this problem because after that there was two sportsmen who used the same technique with the dead wrist and all can see that's what's happened with that supplements in with that style like there was Barbora and there was Laclan on the third round who used the same technique but this is not working at all
Irakli Zirakashvili: Okay, is it because he is just more controlling opponents for Nader? Yes, like he said that you give him the correct outside.
Engin Terzi: wait a minute like he didn't uh lose his position to take hands back and he had control center better one and this is uh because you give him uh advice yeah advice for your advice yeah yeah yeah i remember i remember after he lost to tatashi she came to me and he was like again what am i doing wrong you know and then i told him you know the way to pull you know because he was only
Engin Terzi: was only pulling this way he needs always always all times you just go yeah yeah but the guy is just putting all kind of pressure because the guy has this angle but if if it actually would just turn here he cannot put the pressure but if the guy has here and then now he can put the pressure so that is why i think that more iraqi will be strong here more he will be effective it's my opinion
Irakli Zirakashvili: Now he's ready physically for this. When he's sparring with Levan, he doesn't think that he needs to back. When he has sparring with any sportsman with Levan or with
Engin Terzi: now yeah anybody else he yeah yeah he working to be more center or something like this yeah yeah i think i think it will be a tough match you know i think i'm telling you i think uh john cannot control iraq's tornado he cannot there is one way john to go is to take iraq's wrist if iraq's wrist handles the pressure you know here he has chance to win
Engin Terzi: If Irakli's wrist doesn't handle the pressure, then they will both stay like this, both, you know? And then I don't know how the match will go from there, but John is more used to pulling the side pressure even. I mean, as long as he has pronator, if he makes his opener's wrist flat, if both has the flat wrist like this, I think it will be a good match. It will be a good match. But if the wrist stays like this, flat, flat,
Irakli Zirakashvili: I give the edge to John, because he's much more experienced in that way. But if Iraq totally takes John's risk, then Iraq is going to win that one. And if Iraq loses the head, . Yeah, he thinks the same.
Engin Terzi: yeah it will be it will be a breathtaking match for me i will just sit there i probably i will not sit and i will just watch it you know it will be incredible incredible yeah a future future legends versus uh the greatest of all time that match will be wow
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but just directly, this guy is 58 years old. We don't know when he's going to quit. And we don't know how long he's going to go. So I hope he goes like five more years. But just remember, this may be your one and only chance to face this guy.
Irakli Zirakashvili: You are young. You are young. But he is not going to pull 10 more years. Yes, yes.
Irakli Zirakashvili: He thinks that there is only one time when he has the chance to have a match with John. And he thinks that he will use this chance and he will win. Yeah, yeah, I understand. And John is planning to compete against Denis Sivlenko after this.
Engin Terzi: and many many people are thinking that if if john is planning to pull dennis and if he's bringing his shape to that level they will say that like he will not even feel directly this this is some of the people thinks that way what does he think about this um
Irakli Zirakashvili: I also think that people should be aware of the fact that when you play tennis,
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yeah, you know, like there's no more how that's people thinking.
Irakli Zirakashvili: but this is for him, this is the better, because he know that for that match, John will be more better shape, and he will be seriously preparing for him, and there will not, after their match, there will not some meaning that maybe John was not preparing enough for something like this, and his win will like...
Engin Terzi: More valuable, more meaningful. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's what he's saying. Okay, I understand. Yeah. Yeah. And my opinion, my opinion about this that, like, John is all about table time, his training. I mean, in the past, he was totally and now even mostly, he's doing table time. So when the match is close, his endurance is very, very good.
Engin Terzi: So in my opinion, I think Irakli will need a lot of table endurance, especially for his hands. But he already said that he's more focused on table now. So he knows what he is doing. Let's see how it will be. Then I will ask him about some of his predictions.
Engin Terzi: yes yes the the worst part worst part you know when you are pulling and the power is close you are the one that who is saying boom you know and then you cannot power anymore
Irakli Zirakashvili: You know, it's just that the... Well, it's just that... It's just that... It's just that... It's just that... It's just that...
Irakli Zirakashvili: I think more like wrist position will be more important of the match than some and other things. Just wrist will be show who will be win. That's all. Yeah, I agree.
Engin Terzi: I mean, almost, it is almost, almost like, it's very hard to do this to John. To do this to John is very hard. West you can do is just have the back pressure, keep his wrist flat, and then control here a little bit, a little bit, and then hit in this way, like Ongar Babayev did. Anyone who tries just like fresh match, just try to control John's grenade, John will hang them and beat them like nothing.
Engin Terzi: Remember the round one that when John had the control and then even Ongar Bey wanted to go inside, he just hold him. Like when John has you like this, then it is very hard to beat him there. Very hard to beat him there. Anyway, so...
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yes, that's right. John was the first person I met. I met him afterwards, too, and I was very happy to meet him. I was very happy to meet him, and I was very happy to meet him. But in fact, John was the first person I met, and then I met him, and then he told me something.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yes, he was like much longer by when John he see like closely of this match and he think that's first round.
Irakli Zirakashvili: uh john win easily easy and he think that's next matches john can beat him but there was some problem maybe uh john think that it was too easy and you don't preparing so well for next matches than the first i understand i understand and uh like uh i know they don't like to talk these kind of things but we know that
Engin Terzi: levan just started to train just started to train you know just like prepare for the next year and he is not 100 yet and first of all can you ask him which which like shape levan is like if his best shape how we pull against devon is 100 where is he now
Irakli Zirakashvili: Um, um, well, let's pick up. So.
Irakli Zirakashvili: It was in a normal form. Everyone knows that Levan was born in the month of Shedjibri. There is no doubt that Levan was born in the month of Shedjibri. He was born in the month of Shedjibri and then he was born in the month of Shedjibri. He was born in the month of Shedjibri and then he was born in the month of Shedjibri. He was born in the month of Shedjibri and then he was born in the month of Shedjibri. He was born in the month of Shedjibri and then he was born in the month of Shedjibri. He was born in the month of Shedjibri and then he was born in the month of Shedjibri. He was born in the month of Shedjibri and then he was born in the month of Shedjibri.
David Arabuli: like uh he's now in normal shape like just uh that one is not this uh person who we who have the same maximum you know he's progressing all the time and he's just training hard and um
Irakli Zirakashvili: he like um now he is the better than early like uh when he started early preparing now he's the better one just uh he he's not his maximum but he is well shaped like we can't say that he just started he's not ready so for something okay can can iraqli when when leone is waiting only waiting can iraqli give him some trouble
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yeah, like, it's that.
Irakli Zirakashvili: yeah he's uh like outside um he think that's um uh he's good shape because when he has five with leo one he's he have like sweet uh i'm not sweet uh like he have uh sweat yeah yeah yeah yeah he's sweat at the time he's sparring yeah okay so he makes leo one sweat yeah yeah yeah
Irakli Zirakashvili: Okay, so that's a good sign for him, yeah. Yes, that's a good sign. Leo, I would like to say something in Turkish. I would like to say something in Turkish. I would like to say something in Turkish. I would like to say something in Turkish. I would like to say something in Turkish. I would like to say something in Turkish.
David Arabuli: When Levan was in Turkey, he talked with Kudric and he said to Levan that Levan has no sparring partners and he must spar with the people who like this grip. And he was smiling.
David Arabuli: i must show him like like take his in georgia and show him how sparring partners i have and then he will he will know that i can sparring with them like this yeah yeah yeah so you are saying that le one cannot be directly from holding low and no of course you can't
Engin Terzi: cannot okay okay he can beat him easily but not like this okay i understand yeah yeah yeah i remember one time leon was telling me that like you know it is very very hard to control exactly you know he said that he cannot wait you know if he waits longer longer longer longer and then iraqis
Engin Terzi: uh becoming very uh difficult to control yeah okay so let's let's talk a little bit more about uh the other matches before we finish okay i will ask him his predictions and then he can tell us we we already know uh that uh he thinks uh michael is gonna beat on garber and
Engin Terzi: He thinks he's going to beat John, right? These are two predictions already. Okay. Okay. Another thing, but honestly, not because of respect, not because other people are watching. Right from the heart, what is the percentage of, I mean, he's thinking he has, you know, a chance against John.
Engin Terzi: I don't know if he knows all of these guys, but they used to be his category as well.
Irakli Zirakashvili: uh did he did he follow the waffles any any any final videos or any categories did he watch yes like minimum finals you're always watching yeah and we are gonna have the lightweight world title between
Engin Terzi: Nurdaulet Aydar Khan from Kazakhstan versus Mindaugas. And how does he see that match? Aydar Khan will win. Aydar Khan will win? Yes, yes. Okay, I understand. And does he know Craig Tullier?
Irakli Zirakashvili: It's an American company. Is it an open company, or is it a private company? It's a private company. It's a private company. It's a private company. It's a private company. It's a private company. It's a private company. It's a private company.
Irakli Zirakashvili: yeah like when when you write that's much with some lucia you just uh know if you check on instagram and uh you know like see this person for the first time yeah okay okay okay he's he's like he's he has been playing about 30 years you know and in 2000 i i had a final with him it was my opponent in the final 22 years ago
Engin Terzi: I won, I won, yeah. Of course. Anyway, so does he think that Craig has any chance or not at all? No. So he thinks that there is nobody can beat Samushia under 85 kilos in the world?
Engin Terzi: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Irakli Zirakashvili: And he will be ready. No one can beat him. Okay, I understand. So he's saying that if Samushia is ready, nobody under 85 kilos can beat him. Yeah. Was he surprised when Daniel beat him in the first round? Yes, yes, yes. I don't think so. But I think Samushia wasn't ready.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yeah, he thinks that Samushia wasn't like ready for that match because a sportsman who has a hook, like who is hooker, when he will take Samushia's wrist, then this is different things, you know. Okay.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so let's continue. Let's continue with the other matches. There's a very important match I will ask him now. Ferit Osmanlı vs. Genadi Kvikvinia. It's a very interesting match. It's a very interesting match. There's two, like, well match is waiting.
Irakli Zirakashvili: And he wants to see this, but he thinks that 60% of Genadi will win that match. And how does he see Genadi winning that match? Does he see Genadi to top it or does he see Genadi to hook it? I don't know. I don't know.
Irakli Zirakashvili: what she can go they come for tuleva he said he think that's gonna have both sides he can pull how need uh for his opponent with the table and how will he feel he sense then that will be the k for you i understand yeah anyway so let's continue more uh pauline versus rustam pauline had a very
Engin Terzi: dominant victory against Irakli Gamtenadze. And I didn't expect it. I mean, I expected it to be a tough match. I didn't know who could win, but I didn't expect that kind of domination. And does he think that Pauline has a chance against Rustam Babayev or Rustam Babayev is going to win? Because Rustam has a bigger name. But while he has been away from armwrestling for some time,
Irakli Zirakashvili: so he's coming here maybe like four months maybe preparation and how does he see this match this is the world title for 95 kilo
Irakli Zirakashvili: When you write this match, we talk about it, this is a tough match, but Babayev will win. Babayev will win? Yeah. I understand, yeah.
Irakli Zirakashvili: But is his surprise or power of all in his performance against Irakli? I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
Irakli Zirakashvili: like there's too much time that's come cannot they don't compete like and for this reason he didn't know like which form he was on the competition and like he did not think that's comfortable to win or lose just you he he just uh see that's much and that's all i understand yep
Engin Terzi: Okay, Gabriela versus Barbora. Oh, very good match. Yeah, this is this is probably the biggest woman match in the world. Yes, yes. Gabriela is very strong. But Gabriela, my opinion is that Gabriela has some drawbacks.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Gabriela is too strong, but he has a problem with the wrist. He thinks he doesn't have enough power to beat another name.
David Arabuli: barbara yeah he can't barbara yeah he can't beat barbara like when he see the love competition barbara you think that's uh with him he held the best sparring partner for him because barbara is too strong yeah barbara is incredible and then we will see that the woman uh whenever i set a match david like yeah if people don't know they are asking me
Engin Terzi: Engin, I don't know this person. Why do you set this match? My friend, I mean, if you don't know this person, I mean, it is because you don't know much about armwrestling. Not because this person is not good. That person is good. Like, for example, Barbora. Barbora is incredible. So they should be, in fact, you know, thankful to me that I am bringing this unknown but super elite pullers
Engin Terzi: to do their attention so that they get to know. That is how they get to know, you know, many of the people that I am bringing to West versus West, because many of the West guys don't know the West guys. Many of the West guys don't know the West guys. And like, for example, Barbora, I mean, incredible. The woman, if Gabriela beats her in January, she has chance to beat her, but I am afraid that it will be the last time she will beat her.
Engin Terzi: Because this guy, this girl, Barbora is still young, very young. She is 20 or something, 21 years old. And imagine her like five, six years later, while, I mean, she's built so big. She is like 185 something. And she's like thick, not fat. She is like athletic. You know, she's like, you know, like how to say,
Irakli Zirakashvili: Almost like Levan of the male arm wrestling, you know, for females. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: What is her weight? Her weight? Yeah. Barbora, I don't know, but if you ask my opinion, I would say, like, I don't want to say, but minimum 110 kilo, or maybe.
Engin Terzi: maybe maybe maybe but she's not fat you know of course that we have unnecessary yeah but but she's not fat you know she's like thick you know she's just strong she's like a like a uh how to say like athletic you know woman and then i don't know she's and she's not like typical girl arm master like there's no disrespect but the female hand and wrist is
Engin Terzi: created a little bit like sensitive for men you understand the woman you know yeah you know but this girl is not like that this girl almost was like this this you know i have seen directly i have seen uh barbara beating christo in hook
Engin Terzi: strong woman yeah yeah but i think it was left arm but still you know not bad you know um i don't know maybe maybe maybe maybe he was tired but that girl is no joke oh gabriella is no joke either gabriella if we count if we count her junior titles
Engin Terzi: together with the senior titles she has more world titles than the number of the world titles that she has is bigger than her age so she thinks that barbara has the edge or she thinks that you know close match how does she see how does he see
Irakli Zirakashvili: I don't know if it's going to be an easy match or something, but I think it's going to be a very good match. I kind of see 50-50, but today.
Engin Terzi: one year later i would give the edge to barbara but now i see uh 50 50 so another one we have um who do we have i'm i'm like getting kind of tired okay corey west versus arif artem
Irakli Zirakashvili: Well, I don't think he's a very dominant player. But I think he's a very dominant player. But I think he's a very dominant player. But I think he's a very dominant player. But I think he's a very dominant player. But I think he's a very dominant player. But I think he's a very dominant player. But I think he's a very dominant player.
Irakli Zirakashvili: like uh early like yesterday do you think that's uh dominant on this march is uh arif but uh today he saw the video like yesterday corey had a match in usa yeah
Irakli Zirakashvili: like if um like
Irakli Zirakashvili: early how complete corey west then um arif will win there is no and other things but um if he have like the same transformation on the right hand uh to like left he had then there will be tough much yeah okay he is saying that if corey's right arm is as good as his
Engin Terzi: This is 50-50. Yeah, but if there is a difference, then Arif is better. And Koryves with Ferit Osmanli's left arm? I'm not sure about Ferit's left arm. This is a very interesting question. Ferit's left arm...
Irakli Zirakashvili: He can say it's Will Ferit or Will Corey.
Irakli Zirakashvili: will win korea but like fred is good shape like he didn't um video for him so good shape because he saw his match with uh with uh and he is wonderful yeah so what is his i didn't understand his prediction it is 50 50. you think that's uh this much is 50 50. you can't say that's
Irakli Zirakashvili: Okay, okay, I understand. And now, Irakli, a very important match. Chen Xiao versus David Arabuli. David Arabuli was the one who said that he would be able to translate everything into Turkish.
Engin Terzi: he said that i must win or if i can't win i will be on the translator in turkey then that's all yeah okay i understand listen directly if this guy lose then leave him in istanbul don't take to georgia yeah and
Engin Terzi: From now, only translator. No more arm wrestling if he loses. I'm not a good translator. Maybe I will be better arm wrestler than translator, but we will see this one. And David, how do you see this match? Like my match? Yeah. Like I see it, I must win. You feel that way?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, of course, of course. But same at Irakli, you didn't pull, you didn't compete for some time. What do you think about this? Do you think it's a disadvantage for you while Trans Shaw is competing all the time?
Irakli Zirakashvili: The difference between my situation is that all of this time when I didn't compete, I was always training hard. I was training with arm wrestling, it is not only fitness or something like this.
Irakli Zirakashvili: LeJuan with Irakli and I think that they have progress for this time and the difference between my shape and their shape that is the same what was like four years ago and like I see this situation like this because like I didn't like I compete in the Georgi national champion like there was
Irakli Zirakashvili: uh like two years ago or like less uh but i think that's now i'm best uh like armwrestling better than i ever want yeah i understand yeah let's see let's see let's see how it will be because um that this is gonna be a uh top one yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: then do you do you uh how do you see the match between chan chow and uh ryan bowen ryan bowen invited him to australia to pull him uh my opinion or your opinion both both just you just give your opinion i'm coming yeah
Irakli Zirakashvili: Okay, okay, what's the opinion?
Irakli Zirakashvili: okay we will we will um like send angry
Irakli Zirakashvili: chance of to Ryan and like their our prediction is that Ryan will lose in the same in his country. That's all. So you are saying that it's a mistake that he might chance. Just tomorrow. Yes, yeah. OK. OK. Now very important match again.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Very important match. Alizhan Muratov vs Oleg Petrenko. Left arm, 105 kilos. Good match? Yes, yes. Very good match. Yes, yes. Thank you. I think if Muratov didn't make it to the start, if he didn't make it to the first round, he would have had a very good start.
Irakli Zirakashvili: He thinks that if Petrenko can stop his first attack, then there will be a tough match. But there is a lot of...
Irakli Zirakashvili: Petrenko's goals must be to stop his first attack. You are saying that there is a possibility for Ali Can to win quick, but if Petrenko stops him, then it will be a very good match.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah because because iraqli if you remember alijan can pull also one minute two minutes in hook maybe you remember in 2017 in hungary and he and my students muhammad in the youth category it was at that time my student i don't train him anymore but at the time i was training
Irakli Zirakashvili: They had a match more than one minute. They had a hook match. So Alizhan can also pull long time. Yes, Alizhan is too strong. And he's too smart. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Most of the Kazakh guys are very smart. Yes. Yeah, we talk that there is, well, like in West and West, there is more and more Kazakh sports fans than the army. But it is normal, you know, when you look at the WAF for many years, they are also one of the successful. Yeah. Russian is dominant. The Georgi and the
Engin Terzi: the Ukrainians, and especially Kazakhs, some Turks, some Bulgarians, you know, we know, we know, you know, I know, you know who are these guys, you know, yeah? And Polchop versus Zhurav. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Irakli Zirakashvili: There is the same situation. He didn't know that sportsman. When you write that match, he just searched on Instagram that sportsman. He thinks that Zurov will win him. That's all. Okay. The Canadians are thinking that he's going to destroy Zurov. I don't think that Zurov is going to win. Well, it's not like that. Zurov is a very hard-working sportsman.
Irakli Zirakashvili: maybe he's he's strong guy but destroys rob is not possible he's not possible you know because he's he's working hard and that's all so you want to know how much how much is difference between the weights like because this guy is about 115 kilo around or maybe
Engin Terzi: like 250 pounds about like less than 115 more than 110. okay okay yeah this is yeah andrea said that alijan had a minute long war with drop two he lost that time i think you're talking about the year that you know alijan won the the the youth category that i was talking about my friend and uh
Engin Terzi: He only four days ago, he had those minute long boards and then he competed the seniors and then he took third place there. Anyway, so, and then another important, very important super heavyweight title match between Jerry Cadorette and Georgi Tsvetkov. Oh, Tsvetkov, that is so good. He called Cadorette Nuggets.
Irakli Zirakashvili: From this position, do you think Tretko will win? Because for that position, Tretko's style is more open.
Engin Terzi: uh and the this position is better for jerry so he is saying that he is opening himself and that's why jerry can yeah yeah so iraqi thinks that um george should focus more on side for this match um yes yes people people are asking to
Engin Terzi: Irakli, on this earth, who has the most chance against Levan? I know Levan has the most chance against anyone, but between all the other guys, who has the most chance against Levan?
Irakli Zirakashvili: I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
Irakli Zirakashvili: He thinks that no one is even close to him.
Irakli Zirakashvili: because like we see his domination to all sportsmen and see that these sportsmen have tough matches between together and they are on the same level and Lewand's level is the difference so about Lewand he is saying that anytime soon
Irakli Zirakashvili: we are not going to see an exciting match with him. No exciting match for Levan, huh? We didn't think like this situation, but how you think he want to ask you? Not like, like, like sportsman.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah yeah but but just remember i'm an organizer yeah yeah i i i want to say you're not organized yeah but yeah you say that just as an athlete but it doesn't change like say say the name who is who have more chance uh okay okay there are there are a few guys i think i think i mean i i don't know that i don't know that but uh for sure hermes is one of them
Engin Terzi: Like right now, I think that Ermes is the one who deserves to pull Levan. How much chance he has? I don't know. The Ermes that I saw in Istanbul against Dave Chaffee doesn't have big chance. Yeah. If he can do something more, I don't know. But Ermes that I saw in Istanbul, in my opinion, cannot beat Levan.
Engin Terzi: But it doesn't mean that as Irakli is changing, Hermes can also change. But I don't know if he can, how much he can, and if what he did will be enough or not enough. But right now, the only problem is that we have a guy who is very, very strong, and this guy needs to compete. You understand? People criticize Levan.
Engin Terzi: for not pulling so often, but it is also the guy doesn't have so many opponents. You understand? Like it is very hard to find an opponent for him. This guy is almost too much, you know, for everyone. So, I mean, we can put, but the match may not be so exciting, but Hermes is the one to me is the closest one now. Who else can do?
Engin Terzi: I don't know, maybe Zaur Pajzulev, maybe they should pull. He looks good, but I don't know. If you ask me, I mean, if I have to bet, I don't bet, it's against my religion, of course I would bet on Levan, you know. But what to do? You know, this guy is just too strong, you know. Yeah, just like, that is not correct if we will tell that if there is some names with who we can tell that they are strong guys, like Levan beat all of them.
Engin Terzi: Yes, but life doesn't stop. You beat them, but life continues. The guys are coming. You understand? If you go five years ago, Lewand wasn't like this. Lewand also improved, improved, improved, improved, improved. So other guys will also improve, but time will show. You understand? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Because if everything was the same, Levan beat this guy, it finished. No. Maybe some guys are still progressing. Young guys. Yeah, but the name of these guys who can have more progress than others. Maybe Morozov? Maybe Morozov? Yeah, like there is some young sportsmen, you know? I mean, it should be the young ones, my friend. Because...
Engin Terzi: The older ones are very, very good as well. Very, very good. But I don't expect a very, like, huge progress. Yeah, yeah. A guy 45, 50 years old, he can get better. But I don't think he can go like skyrocket, you know, like this. They may get better, but it would be like this. The young guys, just imagine, you know, February 2022, Morozov.
Engin Terzi: And then November 2022, Morozov. I mean, it's changing. The guy is changing. He's getting better. So we don't know how much potential. Older guys are about the end of their potentials. The younger guys are still progressing, but we do not know how much they can progress. Like Levan progressed a lot.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so that is another match. We have Ahmet Yenerer and Robert Baxter. I am not sure if you guys would know their name. These guys had the final in the Grand Masters last year at the WAF. Last year, I think Robert beat him. This year, Ahmet beat him. Ahmet is from here and Robert is from the United States. You guys probably don't know them, right?
Engin Terzi: No, maybe, I don't know. Doug Erlich. Doug Erlich. I asked his last name, how to pronounce. He told me this way. Doug Erlich and Raimonds Liepins. And you guys know Raimonds probably, but you don't know Doug probably, right? Raimonds Liepins. Yeah, that's correct. That's what I expected, yeah. Because, I mean, whenever I ask, like, for example, David, Arabuli.
Engin Terzi: If I ask to Western guys from America, they will say, I don't know. Same situation like us. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Same, same. That is why I do this West versus West. So like if I would ask them nine months ago, who is Zurab, they will say, who is this guy? And now he pulled with Rambet, he pulled with other guys. If you say Zurab,
Engin Terzi: like 95 of the north america know about zurab so that that is one of the reason that i want to do this to give chance because those waft guys are very very strong guys you know iraqi knows you know just very strong the competition is very strong competition and but they don't take so much attention like what finals 1 000 people watch it's free 1 000 people watch live
Engin Terzi: understand yeah if if i would do live for the east versus west if i could somehow uh cover the expenses if i would do just pre-live live broadcasting i'm sure that there would be like 50 000 50 000 people would watch that so but it is almost the same guys who used to pull in the waft with some americans of course but so that is why i do this so that people would know
Engin Terzi: these guys like you guys so that uh the community would be this anyway like they have their world arm wrestling world and we have our own you know situation when you can meet yeah yeah yeah there we are all together we are all together and this is now the real world you understand real world yeah because we have only one world but we are we were divided now we are all together so it will be
Engin Terzi: very very good and this guy you you georgian guys are just like for like months and months and months all the time bako saginashili bako saginashili bako saginashili okay tell me about this guy because even even lewan said that
Engin Terzi: This guy is very strong. He told me one time on the live broadcast. He also told me privately, but you know, there are so many guys to set match. So it is not that easy to find a place. So how strong is this guy?
Irakli Zirakashvili: Okay, like he's too strong.
Irakli Zirakashvili: really too strong because he we know this guy when he was for 40 years old and like he's too strong he he competes in the world competition in aeroplane competition he always winning the both hands just uh he's strongest guy in georgia who is under like maybe
Irakli Zirakashvili: 20 years old like less um just like if you will think maybe school boy like you will take school boy maybe of both hands he can't win to saginashvili like that is what siraklu said because he is incredible oh oh yeah he is saying that schoolboy needs to do with two hands
David Arabuli: yeah come on even iraq can not beat scuba like he's smiling you know we have the cure level and he's smiling like he's going to talk much you know because both sportsmen are younger and to check like how strong this georgian guy but he's only 95 95 kilos scuba is about 120 kilos
Irakli Zirakashvili: i think that's different we think that's changed between the weights there's no problem for georgia guys uh ask that about chan's shop
David Arabuli: I think that Zurab is for the difference between the weights. I think there are stronger guys. When you ask him if he needs to compete or not,
Engin Terzi: like to think like problems or difference or something like this if you need to beat heavier guy then you beat if you lose then before that match whenever i i asked all the georgian guys the georgians guys said that they were his rap was gonna beat the show anyway so uh the about the bako how do you say is them bako or bacho
Engin Terzi: Pacho, I think only competed one year to do international. It was 2019, under 15 years old in Greece. And I think he must be now 17 or 18. Yeah, like 17 or 18. Yeah, yeah. I think next year he will be 18. Yeah. I mean, right now, you know that I cannot invite the Russian pullers because WAF doesn't allow the Russian pullers. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: But once, I will push. I'm already pushing for April. And then, yeah, why not? I mean, if I can get just, let's see. Let's see. Yeah, okay. Schoolboy versus macho. But if schoolboy beats him directly, I will remind you this. Just two hands. Okay, okay. Approved.
Engin Terzi: okay anyways maybe maybe i would find him someone do you guys remember the guy the beat bojidar the adam borzinski yeah you know he beat bojidar yeah iraq do you remember okay yes yes how do you think bacho versus him
Engin Terzi: yeah there's no problem do you think he can beat adam yes okay so it means that macho now can be bojidar as well automatically uh like he is really strong guy you know yeah because like
Irakli Zirakashvili: uh we see his progress and um like he has his own trainer like you can or anyone can talk with him and um like with the opponents i don't think that she will have a problem you know what's his weight right now yeah 95 95 when i saw him he was 15 years old
Irakli Zirakashvili: in 2019 European Championships in Greece. And how tall is he right now? Like height, yeah? His height? Yeah, yeah. Like 185. Oh, 185.
Engin Terzi: That's why he was 15 years old. He's like quality, you know? He's like shredded guy. Okay. Like, yeah, he's muscle guy, 95 muscle guy. Okay, okay. One more question. Do you think that he can give trouble to Samushia? I know he beat Samushia left arm, but with right arm, how would he be?
Irakli Zirakashvili: uh like he don't think that you like he didn't compete like samusha didn't compete on the right hands and he had a prediction but what is your prediction
Irakli Zirakashvili: You know, that's competition. Bacho win like left and then right. Just on the right hand Samushia didn't compete. Yeah, I know. What's your opinion? Do you think that it could be a good match? Yes.
Engin Terzi: yeah okay yeah yeah okay just meet two georgian guys east of the west that is not interesting much it's really better if you will find someone uh for like for us for ginger no no no no no no no i would never said to georgian guys no i'm just trying to understand his level like yeah yeah yeah so i would never do that unless i will do two country guy at the east versus west
Engin Terzi: only if it is a title match if those guys are better than anyone else you understand they beat everyone and then nobody else so they need to pull each other but until that time no same country guys you know i will not do that yeah like uh we can we can like basically easy to know his level like um he's always in the shape uh by like maybe we know he's um like um
David Arabuli: level like six months ago and now he's different level you know but he has his own trainer and like he likes school you know armwrestling school in georgia and that is too easy to know his level i understand so and if i set him for uh april he will have another four months
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah but i don't i don't promise i will see yeah yeah yeah okay anyways guys thank you very very much i i love talking with you guys and thank you being my guest and i wish you the best iraqli against john and to you david against chan show and hopefully hopefully i will have you as my guest as well okay thank you guys thank you and thanks to everyone who followed yeah thank you
