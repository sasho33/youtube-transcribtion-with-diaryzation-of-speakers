SPEAKER_04: You guys are the ones that are supporting the sport that I always loved and I gave my life. Are you still competitive? Are you going to grip up with some young armwrestlers? When I'm ready, yes, I start training. It is kind of getting a little bit better, a little bit better. I'm getting a little bit used to, but where am I?
SPEAKER_04: Maximum 60%. Yes, Andrea, he was incredible. Emil versus Alan. Emil's hand, wrist control, everything was amazing. But Alan has so much horsepower, my friend, so much horsepower. Yeah. Yep. Soon my guest will come.
SPEAKER_04: Back pressure in trading cards or delivery? No, anything back is outside to me. Anything in is inside. And then shoulder pressure and the side pressure, I didn't want to do it. Yeah, so much. Mark Meyer, Emil from Armenia is in Senya. He's very strong.
SPEAKER_04: There are many good guys. But I will tell you guys something about the bad performance of both Gachev and Ferit. Since the war, since the Ukraine war, the flights to Russia and flights from Russia are very weird, you know. There are a lot of delays, a lot of, like, postpone, you know, things like that. And when I called Ferit night before the event,
SPEAKER_04: he and Gachevski were at some airport and together and they were spending the time in the airport on the seats they were sitting you know they spent all night at the airport yeah yeah Hutchings will have a super match in April um see somebody is asking me what do you think of Zurab's static curl training style Benji says
SPEAKER_04: we can ask that to Curtis. Hello, Curtis. How are you? How are you doing, my friend? How are you? Good to see you. Good to see you. You too. You as well. Zurab said that can you use your phone sideways so we can... This way? Yeah, yeah. Now you are bigger, but maybe you lift a little bit up so we can see you totally. Yeah, I'm trying to fit in the screen here. Yeah, your opponent told me that
SPEAKER_04: If he could do this one hour later, and I said, no, we announced already. He said, Engin, I am on fire in the gym. Fire. Yeah, I see him. He's training a lot, lifting crazy heavy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, hello, hello, Roman. Hello, my friend.
SPEAKER_04: hello my friend but the guy that you're gonna do translation will be five ten minutes late he he just can't stop training he's just so focused on workshop that he just wants to destroy him you know i know he knows he knows he's got to be really strong for me yeah he realizes that right he realizes that i think so yeah yeah this this is this what i'm thinking yeah it's
SPEAKER_04: It is a very, very big challenge for him. And some people, Canadians, they say easily you will win. It will not be even a match. And some other people are thinking Zurab is going to win. Some says it's a good match. And I am one of those that, you know, have no idea about what's going to happen. And I think that your offense is very good, my opinion.
SPEAKER_04: And if Zurab can catch you, stop you, then I think we're going to watch a good match. I don't think it's going to be an easy match. I don't expect him to sweep Wim from his side, but maybe from your side it can happen. Other than that, if the match stops, then we will see who has more horsepower. How do you see this match? Who is that? Is that really Devon?
SPEAKER_04: four four pig noses yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he's such a troll but devon devon if devon was a good friend he would just come and support you you know so i don't know what to think about him
SPEAKER_04: Oh, his schedule is pretty crazy. I know, I know, I know. I'm just still trying to provocate him so that maybe. There'll be lots of guys there. I'm sure that I can get my corner or whoever there. Yes, yes, yes. So. Low justice spectator of my number one training partner, Devon says. Devon, Devon, you and I, we need to talk. I have some news that you won't even believe hearing about that. It's not directly about you, but we need to talk, my friends.
SPEAKER_04: Anyway, so people were asking me what I think about Zaur. I saw Slayer. I saw how big he was, how dominant he was at the beginning at least. And then I saw how Zaur beat him. Zaur may be the number two guy in the world. And in the strap, I would suggest Levan to be careful if the match goes to strap, you know.
SPEAKER_04: That guy in the step is different, different, different guy. Okay, Devon is talking something. He says, I don't know what he's talking about. Devon, you want to join here, my friend? I can send you the link. Come on in. Come on, Devon, join.
SPEAKER_04: Of course, he says, of course. Wow, I thought that he wouldn't. Just, okay. Curtis, can you send him the link? I have to go into Moscow. I don't know how to do while, like, it's on. I'd have to cut and paste it, I guess, and send it to, or forward it to him on Messenger would be the best bet. Hang on here. Just forward the message.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I'll see if I can do this. I'm so bad with technology. There you go, Devin. Roman, some exciting things may happen. I can't say, I can't share, but some, like, if that thing happens, then like,
SPEAKER_01: it will be something historical that like and i i love every time i see excitement in your eyes man it's like i know that something big is coming you know so yeah i'm sure when time comes we will get to know so did you send him yeah i think so i think it just sent there now i'm just trying to look here trying to navigate through yeah i sent them the answers i sent them the link so we'll see what happens
SPEAKER_04: okay there we go oh there should work i sent him the link on the messenger and facebook so hopefully andrea he says engine stop teasing us sorry my friend i will be teasing you guys some long time very sorry very very sorry
SPEAKER_01: So, yeah, it's going to be interesting, me and Zurab, because he's very similar to me. And a lot of the top guys in Canada that I've pulled, like the Rex, the Ryan Espy, they're all big, giant pop rollers, right?
SPEAKER_01: So it's nice to get somebody that's kind of similar. He'll be coming at me, not really running away as much, trying to roll me. So it'll be really stylistically, it's a really good match for me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's got all his hand, his levers kind of similar, so. How tall are you? How tall are you, my friend? I'm five nine. Five nine. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Probably he's about 5'8", probably, is my guess. Yeah, I think he's a little smaller, not a whole lot, but I'm around, I sit around, I'll probably be like 250. I'm using 250, 255 competition. He will be probably 220. Yeah. He used to pull 80 kilos. Okay, okay. And then last time he pulled at the Waffle, he was 85 kilos.
SPEAKER_04: he looks so much bigger he's just thick you know his arms he's big dude yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he he he one of the videos he said that you know uh canadians know the georgian power and i don't know what he meant but i mean uh anyone has any idea
SPEAKER_01: He also said to ask Devon. He told Devon about Jordan Power. Hopefully I can even up the score there against Zerab. You're going to kill him, Porti. We all know it. I'm feeling really good, buddy. Yeah, I know you are. Training hard three times a day. Oh, three times a day. Wow.
SPEAKER_01: More arm wrestling specific. I used to be a big gym guy. I mean, I could still go in the gym and lift a pile of weight, but I'm more just simple. Everything's repetitive, simple, simple, arm wrestling specific. That's it. Yeah. Devon, what do you honestly think about this match? Do you feel like Polk Sharp is going to just go through him, you know, just destroy him? Or do you think you expect any stop on that match?
SPEAKER_01: Do you agree that Porkchop will be the one who will be offensive with the start? I think a lot about this match. Obviously, you know, Porky and I are good friends and we train together like sometimes even three times a week. But, you know, I'm busy, he's busy, but we get together. I mean, we've been getting together for years and training. I think I'm really well aware of how good he is.
SPEAKER_01: i think that this is an excellent excellent match for for porky i think uh you know it's his first serious international super match this is his first one and the thing is with curtis is a lot of people don't realize so he's a very good arm wrestler i'd say for for a guy who's been arm wrestling just about five years maybe five years in march
SPEAKER_01: he's a very very good arm wrestler he can arm wrestle in every single style competently um but but the problem is when you arm wrestle curtis is he's so strong he's so strong so so what happens is if you do the wrong thing he will murder you he will absolutely murder you like when i watch curtis arm wrestle
SPEAKER_01: like he can make if if when when he arm wrestles people and they do he they they just look silly against them like he just destroys them so i think that zurab is really good and i will tell you all those weights you see zurab lifting in the gym that i think that curtis is capable of doing all that and more but i think his technique the way he trains is really dialed in
SPEAKER_01: i put i believe there's a victory for for curtis i'm super biased obviously i'm so i know i am i'm super biased but i can't help but think that curtis is a naturally bigger better technical and better conditioned arm wrestler even for a guy who's been arm wrestling five years i think it's gonna be awesome i think curtis is gonna i think the first couple of rounds might be interesting but i think by the end it'll be very clear that uh
SPEAKER_04: okay one second one second you said first couple rounds may be interested if it is interested enough so it is gonna go down to endurance well not necessarily endurance well endurance will be a factor but i think it'll be you know like the main thing will be technique and strength i think that will be the main thing it'll be stops and then if you see a war then it will be all about who
SPEAKER_04: lost more energy during those those fights you know the one that who has better endurance will perform better if the fresh rounds are interested it means the power will be equal or near equal but that is why i cannot see a scenario where zurab pounds him i can't see i mean stop for sure but but do you see courtesy is just like running over
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it's going to be a run over myself. I think that it's going to go in the straps. And I think that Curtis is going to be in a favorable position. Oh, so then we expect... Maybe not full, but more than Zurich.
SPEAKER_01: so so the drop you'll be guessing out more because of a little i think you'll be a little bit turned over i think zurab will be trying to go inside and and um and i think that curtis is going to just hold a little bit more of the important parts of arm wrestling and he'll be in there too if he wants but uh i i see zurab just being in poor position
SPEAKER_01: and and ultimately ultimately we'll find out that curtis is just too strong everywhere anyways but uh that's that's the way i see it i'm excited it's it's the match i'm obviously the most excited about for uh for this card coming up it's normal your your closest training partner is part of it so
SPEAKER_04: It's very, very normal. Amazing, man. It's awesome. Can't wait. Yeah. I'm so excited. Yeah, we are too. I mean, I love that, you know, that they, I mean, I hate it, you know, for many years that, you know, there are like super guys, both from East and West. They are finishing their careers without even meeting each other. This is so sad. You know, we are not living in different planets. It's not like Jupiter and
SPEAKER_04: earth or something you know and then now i mean you are there from canada very very strong and this rob is also very very strong and then you i mean this is at the end we all are human beings we just arm wrestle but it's good to have this kind of competition it just yeah what you're doing is amazing like getting everybody the best our muscles around the world together you know it's just it's awesome yeah let's say this way what we are doing is amazing
SPEAKER_01: yeah i've been watching them since the start to the like the from the beginning to now and they've gotten better each time each event has gotten much better you you're getting the bugs out of the event like the commentating the intros everything's just when i watch them it's like wow this is amazing i'm going to be there you know yeah it's surreal yeah the only thing is that
SPEAKER_04: When you are limited, your time is limited, everything is limited. If it was up to me, I would be just organizing every week or every two weeks or something. Yeah, for sure. But you cannot really make people excited about it when you do that often. But we are doing our best. And listen, this is a good opportunity. So use it good. Absolutely. Yeah, use it good.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm showing up. I'm ready. I'm going to be ready. I'm training hard. I'm showing up the best I can possibly show up. I'm not taking it very lightly. I know he's a warrior. I've watched all his matches, his war with Ron Bath. I know what he's capable of. He's stubborn. He's got great endurance. He's strong. So it's going to be good. Yeah, it will be very good. And he is just going to join us in 14 minutes. I told him to be late, maximum five, 10 minutes. It's 14 minutes.
SPEAKER_01: Devon, he said that he is training, he's on fire. Can we do that one hour later? I said, I announced everywhere on social media, we can't. But I gave him five, 10 minutes, it's 14 minutes. So it's- Yeah, do five extra bicep curls. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's an interesting match. You know, when you look at Zurab and you look at his history, he's got quite an interesting history to watch, even just at East versus West. Forget all the other stuff, you know?
SPEAKER_04: ron bath that was incredible incredible i still that's one of my favorite matches ever yeah i agree the war john brzenk is interesting it's interesting yeah well i can ask you something when you think about round five you know those two rounds he was trying to sleep and second round even john accepted that same thing to the level but the oh okay i think this man came
SPEAKER_04: There he is. What a surprise. Yeah. Yeah, at the gym. Look at this guy. Right from the gym. Yeah. And. Can you OK, let's see what he's. Oh, I told you last time to not to put your legs like you know.
SPEAKER_04: yeah do you think that like do you feel intimidated do you do you like change your mind no i'm not intimidated i feel like i'm looking at myself i'm a pretty oh yeah
SPEAKER_00: Zorab, you are 15 minutes late, my friend. Yeah, he's down to pay some fines if he wants like a ticket or something to pay fine because of the late latency. He's in the middle of a workout right now. He's in the gym, as we can see.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. I told Curtis that I said, Zura, his lady is in the gym. He needs to train. And Curtis said that, yeah, it's very understandable. He knows that he needs to train more to be competitive against him. Can you translate that? Zura, .
SPEAKER_00: I will repeat myself, sorry, because of the audio delay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I told everything.
SPEAKER_00: And he said likewise, because of how tough this match is for him as well, he anticipates it and that's why he's working out right now. And how does he see his chances?
SPEAKER_02: Of course, he anticipates his opponent. Of course, he believes he's really strong, extremely strong. But regardless, he doesn't want to show up like a very...
SPEAKER_00: big headed guy but he thinks he's gonna be like 70 30 70 for him and 30 for curtis even though he anticipates him and knows that he's gonna be a really strong guy he has a slight internet problems i believe 30 you're gonna kill this guy curtis you're gonna murder him i only got 30 on this one
SPEAKER_01: Curtis, he gives you only 30%. Yeah, we'll see, man. This is the same percentage that he gave to Ryan Bowen. I'm not Ryan Bowen, I can tell you that. I'm not Ryan Bowen. I got a way stronger hand also than Ryan Bowen and wrist, so we'll see. Yeah. Guys, I got to run. I just wanted to come on here and say hi.
SPEAKER_00: Hey, Porky, am I going to see you tonight? I'm going to come. Yeah, I'm going to come. I'm going to hang out. One second. Devon says that Curtis is going to destroy you. Just answer him before he goes. .
SPEAKER_02: That's what Deon and Curtis are doing. Deon and Curtis are getting married, right? And Deon is going to get married soon. They are getting married. I don't think Deon is going to get married. I agree with you very much. And Deon is going to get married. He is going to get married.
SPEAKER_02: Unfortunately, Devon is going to disappoint you big time. He's going to really disappoint you. No matter how hard Curtis will work out and prepare for this match, Devon will be disappointed. That's his answer. You can tell a lot. You can tell a lot.
SPEAKER_02: Roman, let me ask you, is it possible to say that Kourtis is very aggressive when it comes to sports?
SPEAKER_00: So he wanted to first of all tell you guys that he really respects both guys, obviously Devon and obviously Curtis. He really wanted to make that clear. But in this match, we're going to see Zurab's version as aggressive as we have ever seen, like the most aggressive version of him. Like we're talking about powerful and really well prepared, but also aggressive. That's what he wanted to say.
SPEAKER_00: Just tell him one last thing. If he beats Curtis, will he feel like he beat Devon as well? Curtis will beat him, but he won't be able to do that. I think he will beat Devon, but I don't think he will be able to do that. Will he beat Devon? Curtis will beat him, but I think he will beat Devon. Will he beat Devon?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's going to consider like so because of the big speech that Devon has done to Curtis when he said he's going to destroy Zurab.
SPEAKER_00: now he says that yes he will consider that he's gonna be he's gonna say hello to him after he beat cortis he's gonna say on the microphone live tell tell tell zurab i want him i welcome him to come at me
SPEAKER_04: come right at me what's that this will never happen right you will never allow him to have that microphone and say hello to devon right you this will never happen right no i mean you're gonna beat him right you're gonna beat him
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's going to be. It's going to be 3-0. I know this. I'm going to win. I'm coming to win. That's good.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to say something about the competition. It is very interesting to see how the athletes compete with each other.
SPEAKER_01: can you tell to tell people to be quiet is it is it coming he's doing it right now yeah devon do you want to say anything before you leave yeah sure okay so again i'll echo zurab's words and say with the utmost respect for everyone i'll say you can learn a lot
SPEAKER_01: as a senior arm wrestler just by standing close to someone just by shaking their hand sometimes all the information you need and you know if there's a rock and there's an egg the egg can be the most prepared it ever wants to be the egg can train and prepare but when the egg and the rock come together it's always going to be bad news so
SPEAKER_01: I wish you the best, Zurab. But unfortunately, there's a big crack that's going to happen at East versus West 6. And I'll be so happy to watch with all respect to the Georgian people. Devon said it's an egg compared to Curtis and Curtis is right. I got to go, guys. I'll see you tonight at practice. I love all you guys. You all are the best. I'm going to keep killing it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'll translate what you said, Devon. Take care. Okay. Thanks, brother.
SPEAKER_00: Klaucitschio, Kherson, Kamuartin, Ladamia, all of them, all of them, all of them, all of them, all of them, all of them, all of them, all of them, all of them, all of them
SPEAKER_00: But I want to ask you, Deon, specifically, what is the name of Kvartsxhi? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
SPEAKER_00: And whoever loses that match, that person is going to roll down from the stage just like Egg would do. After Egg. He said that he would never say such a thing, but since it's like getting more exciting.
SPEAKER_04: yeah he just asked for who is egg and who is the rock yeah analogies are great say that devon in his analogies eh i love it yeah so so we will we will hear the go curtis ready boom and then we will find out we will find out who is egg and who is rock that's right
SPEAKER_04: I'm coming to fight too. Like I'm not taking anything lightly. I know Zorab's going to come right at me. I expect that. So I just, hopefully I'm ready. I know I'll be ready. So I wish him to come right in there. Like huge respect for both, both you guys, like from my side and I need to really, uh, promote the event and, but just remember that I respect both of you guys and I, I,
SPEAKER_04: I haven't met you yet, but I see and I understand how strong you are. But I have met him. I know exactly how strong he is. And I think it will be an amazing match. And I will be very amazed if one of you would dominate the other one. I am expecting a very tough match and I just can't wait. It will be incredible. Incredible. It's going to be awesome. It's going to be great.
SPEAKER_01: you know how nice it is to arm wrestle a hook guy and not a big giant top roller it's just gonna be awesome yeah yeah and i know you wouldn't want to tell your strategy but do you expect that match to go inside or you think that maybe not it depends like if round one i go through them then i'll probably have fun but i feel like i'm a more complete arm wrestler now the last
SPEAKER_01: year i've really got my fundamentals my top roll my back pressure i'm not just a hook guy anymore and i feel like i have more than one option and if i can win in other ways i will yeah yeah yeah but but just because now you are more well-rounded it doesn't mean that your hook is any less than before right no if you can control the outside you can usually control the inside so wow
SPEAKER_01: I'm just thinking if I should draft this match, you know, to just to watch that close, that close. We're so similar, like both of us, our structures, like everything. Yeah, yeah. Your forearm is also huge. Yeah, it's getting there. My hand's gotten bigger, much bigger the last year. My hand's grown substantially. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Zorab. Zorab.
SPEAKER_04: um like you pull rambat then you pull john brzing then you pull uh chan show and then you pull ryan bowen do you think that this match is more likely to be close to rambat match or how do you expect compared to other matches how do you expect this match
SPEAKER_00: Good question.
SPEAKER_00: uh if we are speaking to like uh if we ask him to compare either of those matches he thinks that it would be more likely wrong bad match yeah this is what i expect yeah this is why how old are you curtis pardon how old are you i'm 36.
SPEAKER_00: 36. Yeah, I've been arm wrestling since 2018. Somebody is pulling it. would like to show you guys, but I still translate it.
SPEAKER_00: 32. Okay, Curtis is four years older, yeah. How long has Zareb been arm wrestling for? Since 2012. Ten years. Ten years. Decade, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: and yeah he also started late then he started 22. it's interesting yeah i was 31 when i started oh yeah yeah and can you ask him his weight yeah
SPEAKER_02: If you want to win, you have to win with your own hands.
SPEAKER_02: I weigh 10 kilos in Shedji Brist. I don't weigh more than that. I weigh 10 kilos in Shedji Brist. I weigh 10 kilos in Shedji Brist. I don't weigh more than that.
SPEAKER_00: so recently he was up to 102.5 but every time before the match he takes a break obviously like everybody else and he's awake he's dropping down but he assured that it would not drop like he assumed that it would be like 99 100 kg during the match like at the match yeah
SPEAKER_01: uh and he also asked curtis how how how much kg are you right now 115 hundred i'm about 112 kg myself i'll drop to a little bit of weight before the match i'll probably be
SPEAKER_04: 260 and then i'll drop down to 250 to 253 usually by the matches 253 is exactly 115 kilo yeah i'll be pretty much right about there so your opponent is 15 kilo heavier than you and you still think that you know he has 30 30 chance
SPEAKER_01: he's 15 kilos heavier than you and it's usually a lot of my opponents are much heavier than me like up here like ryan espy uh rick heiderbeck all those guys all are way bigger than i am yeah i haven't other than todd zilla which i didn't win he's been my lightest opponent in a long time yeah
SPEAKER_00: Zura, oh, he's showing us, obviously. I'm Jordan . I will translate. Zura, .
SPEAKER_00: 50 kilos of meat is enough for you, right? That's only 30% of your weight, right? That's enough for you, right? 30-35?
SPEAKER_00: KG is not scaring him. So he's not afraid of how much KG heavier you are. Todd's yellow is a perfect example of weight to size. Look at what he does to get big guys. So it doesn't really mean anything in the end, really.
SPEAKER_01: If you beat him, he won't say that you beat him because you were 15-gauge heavier. He's going to say that you beat him because you were stronger. No, I know that for sure. I don't expect him to say that at all. He's a warrior man. He doesn't care. Whoever's in front of him, he'll pull them. I have a question for Zurab.
SPEAKER_04: Yes. Since weight is around 99, time to time, would he consider to pull 95 kg as well with 105, 95, 115, but 95 as well? Would he consider? Right now, he's 101 kg. So I will carry on translating. I understand.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, it's impossible. Yeah, yeah, it's impossible.
SPEAKER_02: Gupro is a very strong competitor of mine. It will be released in 2015. It will be released in 2015. It will be released in 2015. It will be released in 2015. It will be released in 2015. It will be released in 2015. It will be released in 2015. It will be released in 2015.
SPEAKER_00: okay and he said that his main goal is to uh get heavier obviously it's gonna take time but uh he will also show up in like 115 kg uh guys like he's gonna put those guys in this weight category right now his next target is 105 kg
SPEAKER_00: uh so his his target is to go higher but he also said that currently like in in the near future he's also um okay with pulling uh very established well-known 95 kg guys and it okay he gave a 30 chance how much chance you you give him curtis jarab yeah i mean you and him yeah
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to go a little less. I might give him 5% chance. Out of respect. I respect him. My mental state is I just don't see myself. My visualization, I don't see myself even going this way. It's my mental state. I'm coming to win. Okay. So in your head,
SPEAKER_04: in your heart, it is 100%. But yes, I believe I can win 5%. Okay. You know, I am. I think it's good that you bought really, you know, like 100%
SPEAKER_01: i mean in you believe that we're both the same type of guy we're both warriors and yeah we're gonna arm wrestle man and we're gonna see you like this that's good yeah and and he only says thank you
SPEAKER_00: Well, let me translate. I think that we have a lot of opportunities, and we have a lot of opportunities, and we have a lot of opportunities, and we have a lot of opportunities, and we have a lot of opportunities,
SPEAKER_00: Obviously, before I remember, I just repeat myself. He said that because of this poor, like a warrior spirit, he respects Curtis. And he expects him to believe that he's going to come prepared to be victorious.
SPEAKER_00: uh so lately curtis is as of he also um kind of um uh discovered that his hand is also not going this way although it looks like it looks that looks like four days right at the middle you know nobody is going this way we'll just look at each other right now that's it there you go there you go huge forum yeah
SPEAKER_04: wow wow wow that will be when the radio comes boom lightning oh yeah i mean i'll be totally impressed i say this is bigger and then i look at cortices i said this is bigger and then i look at here again i think it's bigger so it is both big you know that's all i can say you know yeah if you talk about the rest of the card you know i i will just get your
SPEAKER_04: Predictions and then we can end it. There are some matches. Curtis, first of all, Curtis, you are from Team West. Do you think your predictions will be totally realistic or a little bit biased? It's hard to say like I'm still new to the sport, so I'm still getting familiar with all the pullers, so I'm not familiar with a lot of the East guys.
SPEAKER_04: so you'd have to drop names for me to no but do you do you think that do you think if you know about the match you know you will give a little bit more to the west guys just to support your teammate or you think it will be 100 realistic no i'd be it'd be pretty realistic i i'm a pretty realistic person yeah but i wouldn't really favor you know yeah
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and is there any moderator? Boston is asking about the pay-per-view. Yes, it is in the chat now. If somebody can post on the chat. Okay, let's start. Doug Ehrlich versus Raimonds. Do you know Douglas Ehrlich, Curtis? I don't. You don't know.
SPEAKER_04: okay if you don't know one guy if you only know the other guy so you will not who's the other guy who's the other guy right right today i'm not too sure who they are sorry i mean even if you know one guy you can have prediction if you don't know both guys you know yeah i don't know who they are i think i wouldn't know him either um but okay then let's start corey west versus ferret osman do you know ferrets i i don't but i do know corey is a beast so yeah
SPEAKER_02: tired to bet against that guy after I've seen what he's done. Yeah. And Zorab, left arm, Corey West and Ferit Osmanli. Bogor sports manager Ferit Osmanli. Corey West is a club, so he's the second best in the country. He's the third best in the world. He's been in Salvatore since 1992.
SPEAKER_00: So as a sportsman for Zura, Ferit stands a bit higher, higher level as a sportsman. But right now, he is not sure how good shape Ferit is. And about Kory, he knows how good Kory is. So because of this unsureness, he would say 50-50. I understand, yeah. And this one, I'm not going to ask you. Just both are from the East.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to ask Zurab, . AIDAR KHAN is moving. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win. AIDAR KHAN will win
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, 100% chance. And Curtis, do you know Alican Murado? No. This guy was less than 100 kilos and winning the super heavyweight world title at the World Championships about one and a half months ago, or maybe two months ago. Yeah. And maybe Zurab would know.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry, Engin. He wants to tell you something. So he's saying, Engin, he just wanted to tell you like Murato has lost in championships only two times and both times were against him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it was when he was a youth puller and he was in the youth puller
SPEAKER_04: he had two minutes match against my student in the youth, two minutes, and then he still took third place in the WAF. 2017 Hungary, I remember.
SPEAKER_04: he's impressed but only four days ago he had minutes long matches minutes long matches in the youth category and then he wouldn't want the youth category and he came to the senior and then he took the place yeah yeah he understands yes yes and what does he think about petrenko versus alijan today uh i this paper because of the allegiance the tranquil i've heard that that guy's strong yeah the pattern is the one that pulled with john brzenk
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah that guy's scary yeah i didn't ask you because you don't know his opponent it's hard for you to compare them yeah but i'd put my money on him if he's one of them yeah he's really good yeah but other guys also if you would yeah you know the guy uh res serdekian the armenian guy
SPEAKER_04: know devon always trains from california the armenian guy lightweight you know that you don't know if i've seen him probably i've probably seen him but i just can't think of him right now oh the rest res you should know with john devon just put his video training video with him left arm long long the small guy he's very strong guy
SPEAKER_04: okay i'm so busy training that i haven't really been you know focused on too much other than working out and getting ready for the ride but when i say he just put it like a montague or something okay i'll check it out tell us tell us your prediction uh sorry again i i could i could not catch it uh between who prediction people
SPEAKER_00: Petrenko, you've never seen the card? No, no, no, no, I just... You are part of the crew, you know, you are part of the crew. I know, I know, I know all 16 matches, I know. OK, OK. Anu, Muratov and Petrenko are going to win. I don't know, I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: You can do it with a barbell, with two or three people. I will start with the back of the biceps. Yes, the back and the back. Yes, this is the most important part of the biceps. And this, I will start with this. I can do it with a barbell, I can do it with a barbell, but I can't do it with a barbell. Because I can't do it with a barbell.
SPEAKER_02: Muratov is probably the most popular title, but I think Petrenko will win in 3-2. Petrenko won't be able to win. I'm not going to argue with Petrenko. I'm going to argue with the two of them. This is my prediction. In the second half, it will be clear. Nebismier will win. Petrenko has a chance in 3-2.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, before Roman comes back and translates, people are thinking that Curtis doesn't know those guys' names, you know. Sometimes it's Roman.
SPEAKER_04: you don't pull internationally you know you don't know many names like i'm slowly starting to like i watch a lot of videos and i do yeah yeah i'm slowly learning but like i'm under five years right so yeah and maybe i pronounced the name different than you would remember like if i seen a video i'd probably like oh yeah that's the guy you know what it is if you saw the video i'm sure you will remember but not the name for sure guys from east may not know some of the american guys either
SPEAKER_04: um anyway you'll have to send me a list and i'll do my homework yeah yeah don't worry about it don't worry that that is the reason i am organizing these events my friend to bring absolutely when you are here once you wash everything then more and more we will learn you know that is absolutely my intention is to
SPEAKER_04: instead of focusing on very already very famous five six guys you know there are a lot of good players they are waiting to be motivated understand so we bring them to the stage they are motivated they can show themselves so that next time they come uh everyone will know oh i know this guy so you know zura because he has been here a lot of guys know from here pauline
SPEAKER_04: Of course, people knew already, but some of them get to know when he's on this. So we are unifying. I remember when I first, the first match I seen Azarab was against Ron Bath and I went, man, I'd love to pull that guy.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And what did you say about this match, Roman? About this match, he said that 60 to 40% to Petrenko. Petrenko would lose 60 to 40. But before this prediction, he also said that because of his injury, he couldn't perform as he could have done against Petrenko. But he knows both opponents. He could draw the good assumption. And he says that 60% to Petrenko to 40%.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, tell Zurab that I'm a little bit upset with him about this subject. About injury, right? Whenever he pulled, he pulled Chen Xiao and he lost. He told me that right arm had a problem, set him a left arm match. And then I set him a left arm match
SPEAKER_04: And then he pulled and he says that his left arm is short, set him right arm much now. So tell him that if he ever gets injured, tell him to tell me to cancel the match instead of pulling injured.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, for sure. Zura, let me ask you about the fact that when you told me that you were going to travel to Marjana Khelz, you told me that you were going to travel to Petrekostan, and then you said that you were going to travel by car. Yes, that's right.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, he would. Yes, he would. Yes.
SPEAKER_04: injury is normal injury is very natural the problem is when you are injured you can say we can cancel the match and we can replace the match and then whenever he hears we can set him again you know but i don't want anyone to pull there when they are injured you know
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I see. But what he wanted to say is that he, if he was not ready, he would have told you. So he did specific procedures and he was ready. That's what he wanted to say. From the round one, we told that he was hurt already. And then looking at each other and then I'll translate.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it didn't look like... I mean, it didn't look like...
SPEAKER_00: So in future, he will do exactly like you said, obviously. Only one way that we understand, if he shows us double bicep now, then . No more big, heavy bicep curls. You've got to be ready.
SPEAKER_00: Zulab, Curtis tells you not to lift so heavy before the match. You need to be ready. He says that he doesn't want any kind of excuse when you lose. That's what he says. Zulab, Curtis told me not to lift so heavy before the match. He says that he doesn't want any kind of excuse when you lose. Zulab, Curtis told me not to lift so heavy before the match. He says that he doesn't want any kind of excuse when you lose.
SPEAKER_04: after this week after this one we passes no more heavily okay okay then tell us curtis do you know who rushtan babaev is yes rushtan babaev and pauline oh man i like them 95 kg world title you know people underestimate pauline but pauline beat rambeth
SPEAKER_01: I know it's awesome. He lost the last time. What's that? When's the last time Rustem's competed? It's been awhile. I mean, I've seen that guy against monsters and now he's against the guy his weight so like. Oh, I love Paul in. I want Paul when Paul in to win, obviously, but I don't know man. Rustem's got the edge on that one. I think inside.
SPEAKER_04: we will see we will see because even inside pauline gave time to john and john john's inside i mean you realize that he who can beat corey west you know inside right armory he caught him whenever i i gave him on the trading cards eight for his explosiveness people are oh he's too old and you still give him eight he's if he was so young i would give him ten he was very explosive
SPEAKER_04: People think that this is explosiveness, the flash, but no. Even this is explosiveness. Absolutely. The reaching your max power is explosiveness. What do you think about Corey West? Do you think Corey is a slow guy?
SPEAKER_04: Corey is very, very quick guy, very fast guy. And John was able to move quick enough to catch him. So to give him eight is like people, I don't know what they talk about, but I mean, just because he gets older, he doesn't make him become a turtle or something, you know? I like that. The whole card thing, that's pretty cool. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It will be very nice. It will be very nice. I mean, we need to do something to bring this support to some level. You understand? The fans are ready. Fans are ready.
SPEAKER_04: So the organizers needs to be ready so that we can show the world. They can also probably show the rest of the world that they are arm wrestling fans and this is the sport they are fan of. So that is why we don't want to show so much all the time. In the past, it was even worse. It was a bar sport in the very past, you know, I'm talking about. Oh, sure. Yeah. So you are saying that Rustam has more chance, right?
SPEAKER_02: I would give him the edge. I want Paul Lynn to win, but I would give Rustin the edge. Rustam versus Pauline. You saw Pauline against Camtenazze. He was strong. For me, Pauline is the most important player in the game. Rustam is the most important player in the game.
SPEAKER_04: since we have not seen rustam quite a long time now and since we also take an account how pauline has been performing lately 60 to 40 to pauline wow interesting wow and and now let's talk about araboli you don't know curtis i'm not going to ask you about araboli david araboli but but i don't know about david araboli versus chan show
SPEAKER_02: She used to pull David quite long, very long time.
SPEAKER_00: after their last uh let's say uh practice pools and really heavy trainings uh since then david is now even better shape so that makes uh him uncertain about this match so it is 50 50 for him yeah yeah okay now this one coaches michael todd versus
SPEAKER_01: who's he going against on that way you know oh yeah i know who i got i'm going to go with hunger by of on that one yeah i think so yeah i don't know depending what shape michael todd's going to show up is he still kind of injured a bit i don't know but i'm going to give that one to ungambayev sorry about the pronunciations no no no you do very well on that way yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah so you won't say no is the favorite of this match from i think so i think he can i mean can todd stop him in the kings maybe but i'm gonna i don't know yeah yeah i'm i'm live show live show what this is i just translated what is what you have said about this match
SPEAKER_01: He beat John Brzezink, correct, didn't he? Yes, yes, yes. So it's hard to bet against that guy. He's really good. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And how do you see that, Zorab? Zorab Sheroz, Fikropo, Ongar Bairuida, Michael Todd. Michael Todd is a very good player.
SPEAKER_00: Since Michael Todd has dropped the weight significantly and in this weight category, Kyrgyz is quite comfortable. He would give a slight edge 55 to 45 for Ungarbaev to win.
SPEAKER_04: 55 to 45. Okay. Curtis, have you been following all of the East versus West matches? Yeah, I watched quite a bit of them. I'm watching more as I go. Do you know Samusha?
SPEAKER_04: is the 85 kilo champion and he he lost pauline but he was in heavier category he was 87 kilo but he competed at that time we did not determine the weight categories yet and paul was 100 kilo it was a very close match three two pole one
SPEAKER_04: and then he pulled against bojidar for the title match 85 kilo he beat bojidar simeno and then last event he beat daniel krokopchuk and then he defended his title so this time he is going against craig tuller you know craig tuller craig julier yeah yeah he just pulled uh what's his name el sasa right yeah yeah yeah yeah but it was a little bit heavier classes but this time he's 187 85 kilo
SPEAKER_01: and but do you remember david samushia or no no but just from the info you told me and i kind of know craig if you said he beat uh what paul in and that so i know pauline beat social oh he beat him yeah but he was very close match three two he beat but pauline was about 30 pounds heavier than samusha yeah he's strong then obviously that guy so julia will have his hands full by the sound of it
SPEAKER_00: from just from the info you gave me. OK. And Zura? ZURAVILLE BOCHENKOVY- For him, if it's KG limit, like 85 KG limit, Samushio will be favorite in the entire world.
SPEAKER_04: he is saying that at 85 kilo in the world nobody can beat david samusha exactly that's what he said can you ask zurab does he think that if if if hamza comes back he would be a good match with samusha
SPEAKER_04: He remembers how tough Hamza versus Samusha was the battle for Samusha. He would really love to see that. Just tell him that when Hamza and Samusha had one minute match, before that match, Hamza had more than one minute match with Bojidar and need one and a half minute match with the Kazakh guy. I forgot his name.
SPEAKER_04: um so he had minimum minimum two minute matches before uh he pulled samusha samusha was like this you know his draw was he won easy and before hamza and hamza and david pulled one minute match hamza already had longer than two minute matches you know
SPEAKER_00: He wants me to know that this WAF and ERO arm like European and world championships
SPEAKER_02: Any category, any match, he knows by heart. Hamza and Bozidar. Hamza and Bozidar met each other. They struggled. Basically, he said what you said. Hamza had a long battle against Raikhanov. Hamza had a long battle against Raikhanov.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly. And hey, who knows, who knows, maybe Engin Terzi comes, 85 kilos, maybe dangerous, maybe, maybe, maybe. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: that's you that's because i mean you are out of the question because you are in a legendary category so yeah that's why when he said how would someone say his favorite whatever you want old old man old man everybody is like that everybody is injured so you're good to go no no no not everybody i pulled 30 years i pulled as much as your age
SPEAKER_04: he knows okay let's let's go the other one and so you said that he's gonna win that one that one and i'm not gonna ask you that but let's see do you know who barbara is curtis no i don't all right yeah this is so horrible barbara barbara barbara gabriella barbara gabriella
SPEAKER_00: Barbara is about 120 kilos and she is about 190
SPEAKER_00: and yeah yeah yeah gabriella can gabriella can be a tight here in this angle very very tight so maybe that that's the edge yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah enough and then he said that okay jerry cadoret 30s
SPEAKER_04: His name is Georgi Svetko, his opponent. Do you know him? Probably you don't know him. What style is he? Hook, top roll? So he's rolling, Jerry. Yeah. I mean, people beats up people who cannot roll Jerry. You roll Jerry, but Jerry is fine with it. That's what I mean. If he's trying to roll Jerry, I'm going to have to go with Jerry.
SPEAKER_01: yeah because because whenever you go out with him yeah jerry you don't want to really top roll him too much you kind of got to be in the middle of both hook and roll kind of right yeah yeah yeah yeah you're given jerry you know flop press
SPEAKER_02: swedco win personally but 70 percent jerry gonna win 17 because because he thinks that whenever you top roll jerry goes like this and then yeah yeah yeah so
SPEAKER_00: Shvetkov needs to go more like sideways, right? Not uproar. Shvetkov needs to go more like sideways, right? Not uproar. Shvetkov needs to go more like sideways, right? Not uproar.
SPEAKER_00: If Tretko goes more sideways, it will be even better for Cadourette. That's what he's saying. It will be even better. Then in that case, Cadourette most likely will go in hook. Yeah, but protecting your pronator sometimes. Got to be Jerry's shoulder. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He has mastered this style that he has. And basically, he's targeting. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: this style there is not no one better than him there is no one you know i mean yeah and and curtis john bersing versus iraqi zirakashvili oh man good match that's a good that's a good match oh i can't bet against the goat on that one but man
SPEAKER_01: I'm glad that you know Georgian Iraqi Curtis. I'm glad that you know him. Yeah, I know that guy. That guy's really good, man. He's really good. Yeah. I'm going to pick John on that one. But I mean, geez, if it's going to be a war, I think it's going to be whoever's got if it stops. Yeah, I'm going to give the edge to John on that one. Yeah, but how is stuff if it stops in a flat wrist? Yes.
SPEAKER_04: if john is like this i think john will be better like more like side pressure maybe possibly you'll have to do some kind of like hutchins style in a way yeah yeah yeah i'd beat him i think i see it kind of going like that maybe what would you say like this natural like this john wins that one yeah if john tupples still john wins yeah if exactly tupples iraqi wins if you don't try to hook fresh round iraqi wins these are my possibilities
SPEAKER_04: I agree with that. I agree with you there. If he wants to win, he needs to really dominate the hand. He really needs to dominate. Not in equal positions. Because if the match is like this, John will have much stronger... Absolutely. I agree 100%. Can you ask Zorab?
SPEAKER_00: And I will also translate what you guys just said, okay?
SPEAKER_02: If Iraqis do not want to play in this neutral position, Johnny will leave like this, right? And you will have to decide what to do next. I think Robert Scarfelli will play for Iraq, but I think Iraq will play a role in Johnny's game.
SPEAKER_02: But when it comes to the fight, it's the same as the fight against Irakli, but when it comes to the fight against him, it's the same as the fight against Joni. And there is no doubt about it. In the year 50-50, it's the same as the fight against Irakli, but when it comes to the fight against Joni,
SPEAKER_00: As a Georgian, Zurab obviously wishes and would love to see Ivalky become victorious, but he's saying that top
SPEAKER_00: Iraqi has advantage and he believes that Iraqi will take at some point John's wrist. But in side pressure, he had felt John's side pressure. He knows how good he is and he said that John is better in that case. So because of that, he's like 50-50. He's unsure because they both have possible advantages over each other. So one is better back pressure. One is better side pressure.
SPEAKER_04: a good match man i can't wait to see that one yeah yeah yeah yeah it will be incredible it will be incredible yeah imagine all these matches will be one after another and you versus thinking about it what's that i get goosebumps thinking about those matches like that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you will be incredible trust me last time we had the top camera i didn't know that it was that far i made sure that this time the top camera will be so close
SPEAKER_04: that they will show all the knuckles, all the wrists, all the shoulders. Oh, that's amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's what we need. That's what we need. But I realized that it was not like what I was thinking after the event. And they didn't show it long time. They just show it three seconds and then went away. This time, I want them to stay there and they show everything, you know.
SPEAKER_04: so many people like i talked to they want to see that camera angles of everything like that you know yes yes yes yeah i mean no matter what you are uh trying to do it's important how you how you package you understand that that's very important yeah yeah another one uh i will ask you to zoom up because you you probably don't know about arif uh arif versus corey west right arm
SPEAKER_00: Arjun Akhelik or Arif? Arif Moiris. 100%. He said, Arif, we're going to be confident. Arif will win. Ah, OK. I understand. And maybe percentage, you will also tell. 100%. When he says be confident, he means 100%. OK. And the other one I will ask, this is important.
SPEAKER_04: um yesterday there was an event in chechnya roman and i know because of the the flights after the war with ukraine the flights they're problematic to russia and inside and outside so when when i call ferit uh he was sleeping trying to sleep on airport because although the flights were messed up delayed and everything you know and he and gashevsky
SPEAKER_04: together, they had to sleep in the airport. So next day, they both were like this. So I asked what happened. He said that I am gosh, actually, we both were like, destroyed, you know, exhausted, totally, you know, I don't know, we cannot take away anything from the opponents. But I for sure, I made a video chat with him. They were trying to sleep on the like,
SPEAKER_04: seats like this put in there yeah yeah yeah it affects for sure but i don't know how much so he probably will think that maybe ferret is weak or something but what does he think about gennady versus ferret uh am i allowed also to translate briefly what you just told me about it because the guy who won 85 kilo there he was also in dubai events earlier
SPEAKER_04: Gachevsky beat him there, this time he beat Gachevsky like this. I'm not saying that he cannot beat Gachevsky like that. Maybe even Gachevsky had better sleep, everything, he would still beat. But there was a case also to be considered that both these guys were not 100%, you know. Yeah, for sure. Zurov, you mentioned that Gennadiy and Arif fought, but what did you think?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, that's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true.
SPEAKER_00: I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that
SPEAKER_02: Lias Shuktan Tsaago, a Russian, in Chechnya, in Georgia. He was ex-patriot. He was not a prisoner. He was not a prisoner because of the Genadist debate, and he was not a prisoner, and he did not do anything wrong. I am very sorry for him.
SPEAKER_02: No, not at all. But in 1955-1955, he won the World Cup.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so I translated a lot of things that we talked about and he said that he also watched that match in Chechnya and he saw how close it was against Grigory is his name, I believe. And he said maybe it was because some effect was because of the traveling issues and stuff, but
SPEAKER_00: Regardless, he knows how good Gennady is and he knows roughly compared to him where Ferit stands. So he says 55 to 45 for Gennady to win. I understand. Like slightly. Anyways, Curtis, we have been here for 1 hour and 20 minutes and this guy is ready to destroy you in Istanbul.
SPEAKER_04: and he wants to take the microphone and on the live while devon is watching he's gonna say hey devon look at look at look at your training partner what i did to him are you gonna let something like this to happen not gonna happen buddy no no right yeah that's what i wanted to hear yeah yeah i'm gonna bring my rock my rock and i'm gonna set it right on the table
SPEAKER_04: yeah the egg will come and hit and then get crushed that's it hit the rock and smash so he can he can continue dreaming for more weeks and that's all he can do right tell him he's got to keep doing heavy bicep curls
SPEAKER_00: okay i'll tell you i also translate the egg and rock as well yeah everything i said as well everything exactly like we you both talked uh
SPEAKER_00: It's a very good idea, and it's very motivating. In short, it's like, I'm going to die, and I'm going to die, and I'm going to die, and I'm going to die, and I'm going to die.
SPEAKER_00: That's what I'm saying. It's not like that. It's not like that. It's not like that. It's not like that. It's not like that. It's not like that. It's not like that.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's liking this confidence you have, Curtis. He likes this confidence that you have. You've got to believe in yourself. Yeah. And Zurab believes that he's going to make the speech after the event, right? After the match.
SPEAKER_00: No doubt. He has zero doubts. No doubt, right? No doubt. No doubt. He just said that beforehand, he was preparing only for Curtis. But since we talked today, now he's preparing for Devon as well.
SPEAKER_04: so in that day he's gonna beat they want to buy by the uh performance by beat by beating curtis he will be beating both of them but he said he has no doubt he's gonna make microphone but i heard if i my memory i'm getting old tell him that i'm getting old that i saw there was like 30 percent doubt
SPEAKER_00: That 30% was because of sake of your personal respect.

I gave him squat advice the other day. Did he like the advice I gave him on squats? Squats? You mean like a video you sent? No, I just gave him advice on footing, footwork, wear flat shoes or squat shoes. Don't wear spongy running shoes. They're no good for stability.
SPEAKER_00: It'll improve his squat tremendously. And tell him I haven't squatted in over a year.
