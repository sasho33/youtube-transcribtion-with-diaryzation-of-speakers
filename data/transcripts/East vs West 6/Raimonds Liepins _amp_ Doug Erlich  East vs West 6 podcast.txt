Eight days later, in eight minutes. Oh, not, yeah, eight days later, yeah. Eight minutes, East versus West will be starting. And then it will be starting with the guests that I will have today.
SPEAKER_02: um raymond liepins and gaping i think uh with douglas early here is the man the the provocator he provoked hello marco yesterday douglas and i don't know if you guys saw that but he anyway so i didn't let them talk about it i
SPEAKER_02: I invited Artem Taranenko. He said, no, no, no, I don't want any part of that one. I don't believe you. What's that? Give me a second. No, no, no. It was my volume. OK. You can hear me, right? Yeah. Hello, table. Hello, Marco. Hello, everyone. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He said, no. And I asked, come on, you know. He said, uh-uh. He said he's sorry.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to tell Doug everything that Artem told me about the practice. He told me everything. I know everything. Oh, and then Doug is going to kill Artem then? It's not my problem. Why would it be my problem, you know? Artem will never trust you again. You should never trust Artem, so. Oh, Artem, you were live at 8 p.m.? Oh, I didn't know this.
SPEAKER_02: But I announced this yesterday. I don't know. I don't know, guys. I'm just so incredibly busy. I apologize, Pradeep, for that. I never knew about it. I'm like, brain is like... What was announced yesterday? What happened yesterday? Oh, I mean, I announced this already on social media, everywhere that you guys... Okay, okay. But now I hear that RMS News will be live at 8 p.m. I didn't know about that one, so I apologize.
SPEAKER_02: break out the 2010 quarter microphone yeah let's see let's see how everything will be yeah i mean i can't wait people people get so much used to about this level of event and then
SPEAKER_02: if they don't see the same exact level or a little bit lower they are like ah you know just i'm just imagining if i never organize this first and if i would just come up with this one first and then it would like yeah but you know human nature you know just always probably wants more and more and more and more you know but you worry too much everything everything is fine everything is awesome you worry too much
SPEAKER_02: every time every event is better and somehow this is going to be even better than the last one absolutely guaranteed um let's talk that separately and privately then you will understand anyway so let's go uh where is what time is it oh he has four minutes he said four minutes yeah what did he say he's gonna scream to your face
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he's going to scream something in my face, which is hilarious. After he says he beats you, probably, right? That's what he meant. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It would be weird if he screams when he's getting pinned, but that's exactly how it's going to be. Let's see. I can't wait. I know he's strong. I don't know what exactly his level is, and I don't exactly know where he is at this moment.
SPEAKER_02: I know you have been doing very well for all year. And let's see. Let's see how it will be, you know. Let's see what the guy is serious. The guy is serious. He says, he told me he's going to humble you. He's going to make you humble at the table. I'm already the most humble guy there is. It's like...
SPEAKER_01: should i stop winning or something you know people like yeah you just you're acting like i'm like i'm winning what's supposed to act like you know if i'm losing then you know and bag is not going to be the guy he's not the guy there's some other people so you are saying that you know you may lose but but not to douglas
SPEAKER_01: of course everyone will lose eventually, you know, it's just like, like last year somehow happened. Like I didn't expect it to happen. Like just after, uh, like on September I was like, Hey, I haven't lost the match. I'm like, Oh yeah. So there's, you can always, I can always fight Levin and lose or you and lose, or, you know, someone stronger than, you know, bigger, you know, way more accomplished and you can lose, you know?
SPEAKER_02: But sometimes you win. I just don't think Doug is the guy. How do you feel, Engin? Do you feel good? Do you feel excited? Or are you tired? I'm excited. I mean, I decided to enjoy more than worrying. So whatever happens, it happens, you know.
SPEAKER_02: so and i'm gonna continue giving the community what they ask from me and how do i understand what they ask from me uh by the official numbers you know if they want like engine focused on a few elite guys and that's all or engine
SPEAKER_02: try to create a league with different weight categories like ufc and then introduce us all those unknown super elite guys and then we get to know more about arm wrestling this is this is what they will choose how am i going to understand what they choose it's by the support the the the paper view that i will understand it okay the community wants me to
SPEAKER_02: serve to arm messing to bring the arm messing to a different level you know or community is asking me thinking forget about them just bring us this this and this guy and that's enough for us so that that is that is not what i will decide i will only follow only follow uh the community community yeah they will just say just three guys four guys just bring us and then that's enough for us
SPEAKER_02: Or show us the lightweights, show us the welterweights, show us the middleweights, show us the left arm, show us the woman, you know, all of them. And then make good official world rankings in different category to bring the arm wrestling to another level. Because if you organize three, four matches, I do continue that. In one year, I can organize 12 matches or just say 15 matches.
SPEAKER_01: Engin, you are a fan of armwrestling. Think about this. What you like in armwrestling, most people will like too. We're not talking about brand new fans that just put their nose in. They know this much of the iceberg that is armwrestling. They know this much. In my opinion, and this is like someone goes, oh, I don't care.
SPEAKER_01: Their opinion doesn't matter. What you like, most of us like. What you've been saying for years is something you should be doing. Like, I wouldn't do anything for anyone else if I wouldn't enjoy it. You've been saying this for years. You've said it for years. We need lightweight matches. We need to bring our people. Don't even talk about making smaller events. Don't even think about it. No, I'm just saying that I can do this
SPEAKER_02: only if the community supports me. If the community is supporting one single uncompetitive match five times more than very competitive, like 15 matches, there is nothing to blame. All I can do is to give them what they want, because this way,
SPEAKER_02: If I don't see a progress, then, then I need to accept the reality that community is not ready. It's nothing to blame anyone. If community says, okay, as an arm wrestling sport of arm wrestling, we are not ready for that. Just entertain us. Then that, that is, that is what I can do because I am not gonna do that with my power. You know, I am only a bridge between defense and.
SPEAKER_02: what they want to see i'm only a bridge i'm not gonna tell them okay you don't want this but i'm gonna yeah yes i do that didn't i do in last just look at the last one years yeah i know i know i was there i was there i was there 27 years at every event 87 you are there even from the first event
SPEAKER_02: yellow can you guys hear me witness sorry douglas i i didn't cut it okay not not to be rude because this was a little bit hot topic don't worry about it it will get even hotter like this you know i just didn't know if you knew i was in yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um anyway so
SPEAKER_02: But as I say, we will all together decide. It is not like there is no bad guy in this story. That is our community. They are probably not ready for such a dream of mine. We all know the formula. I think everyone knows the formula. Formula would be like, you want to keep doing this event. You need at least three big matches that will bring the pay-per-view numbers.
SPEAKER_01: And then people will be exposed to more armistice, like every event does, and create new fans for many more armistices. Like, Sanders became a big star just because of East versus West, in my opinion. Like, he was doing great, but that just, that match versus Matt Mass just, you know, and that wasn't even the biggest match of the card. And it's going to happen, but, you know, I think the formula is right. I think...
SPEAKER_01: East versus West needs to become a league. It needs to become more professional. It needs to be something like UFC, and there will be a huge future for it. Yeah, this is my dream. This is my dream. You know it's my dream. It's a reality now. It's reality. You're on it. You're on it. I'm on it, but let's see. Let's see. It doesn't look like it is just... We will see. We will talk also privately with you. Hello, Douglas.
SPEAKER_02: change the name yeah it is because you're gonna school him at the table right he's gonna show me uh what he calls technique so i'll be very interested in that yeah we will see we will see that look look and look at his tongue intimidating already you see that those arms you see those four arms yeah
SPEAKER_03: and and you know he's just making a comeback and he still has eight days and you know what's gonna happen to you you're gonna scream at his face douglas oh yeah yeah this is this is a long time coming you know the we've been chatting about this for a little while and you know he doesn't a lot of people don't realize there's been some
SPEAKER_03: private you know conversations as well so i have never seen this man in my life i saw you i saw you in uh poland i didn't know who you were why you didn't know because he wasn't that good yeah i said he was carrying janice's jockstrap oh okay
SPEAKER_02: okay so let's start it started it started thinking imagine the first match of the night is the most heated match wow wow this should be the main event but you know unfortunately raymond is another commentator you know yeah yeah i'd like to i like to get it out of the way because it's going to be such a great show i'm going to get to watch it you know that's you know as a fan of what you've got going on it's going to be it's going to be good get it out of the way
SPEAKER_03: make him 16 and one, and then go and watch the show. It's funny that it'll be so hard to watch it with tears in your eyes. It's going to be all distorted. Most likely you're going to be in your hotel room just crying in the shower and just like... Just find a backup commentator because he's going to be pretty shook. He's going to be stuttering a lot. You're going to need somebody that's going to be able to enunciate the words and stuff on the microphone.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I don't know. We will see. Travis can fill in, you know, because I'm too drunk to celebrate. I'll be, you know, just pop champagne right there on the stage and just like going crazy. Engin's going to be angry with me, but it's worth it.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah what to do you know what to do come on let me let me celebrate your saying let's see how big you'll be but that douglas is serious while you are taking like so relaxed so easy you know like so confident while douglas is ready to take your shoulder you know this is how i see you know well hang in and i take it i see that's the thing you know
SPEAKER_03: I'm not a big social media guy, but, you know, I've been reading some comments lately and there's people that are trying to paint Raymond Ray out to be this humble. Oh, it was just a playful video. You know, we there's been there's been more said behind the scenes. But what's what's more disrespectful being direct?
SPEAKER_03: know talking trash to somebody directly or being passive aggressive and making light of the light joke knowing there's truth behind it just so that when the person gets offended by it they can say oh i i was just playing you know i wasn't being serious so they can play victim really it's just that passive aggressiveness is just yeah but he said that there was some reality what what he said that
SPEAKER_02: like he said that he heard from the first person that the things he or he was trolling me you were trolling me raymond or yeah i was trolling uh i sent a message to artem i'm like artem give me all the information and he said doug already thinks i'm a spy and i said okay yeah i mean in uh mine and artem's uh our text group i changed his name to coach ray spy
SPEAKER_03: don't worry he he's gonna tell me everything he's like but there's there's not a lot to tell so yeah there's not a whole lot to tell it's gonna go it's gonna go one way i promise you and all these fans you got all these fanboys you got that are cheering ray ray ray you know it's i'm i hate to break it to them but it's going to be who are you you know asking who's doug who's doug arm wrestling truest know who i am like there was people i've read in the comments when engen
SPEAKER_03: was doing this there was people asked didn't know who engen was saying that they're lucky he's these athletes are coming to his events and stuff i'm like this dude's a legend and it's this big social media boom over the last um you know few years where it's brought a lot of trolls and it's brought a lot of new guys into the sport that don't know that don't know who who a lot of the guys are so i'll show them who i am
SPEAKER_02: Good, good Douglas, good, seriously. I like the approach that you respect in what you are doing and you have respect in your goals and that is the thing, you know, you're just straightforward, not sneaky like Raimonds just making, you know, imitating and intimidating or something. I'm joking, Raimonds, don't get angry. Have you seen me angry?
SPEAKER_03: I find it funny because somebody made a comment on the YouTube post where Ingen screenshot what I said to you and they're like, oh, he loses his shit over something like this. I'm like, that comment isn't losing your shit. Read all the comments, Doug. Just read all the comments. Go under every video, every post. Just read the comments. Soak it all in. Oh, it's motivation.
SPEAKER_02: That's motivation, man. I love it. I can see that Douglas is a pure arm wrestler because he didn't cut the screen from his arm side, hand side, but he cut it from the head side.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah see he has the full arms but you know not the top of the head because he knows what's more important right like this yeah oh yeah oh yeah that's some forearm yeah yeah see he's sweating you see he's just like cleaning his forehead you know oh he's not he moisturized before all this he's got his you know his he probably put one of those facial masks on and pretty good i like it yeah
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we will see. We will see. I can't wait. You know, that is he beat, uh, Ryan Bowen. Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I saw that, you know, that's his biggest win though. So, you know, um, I don't know. I don't, I mean, no disrespect to Ryan, but I don't remember the last matching one. So, um,
SPEAKER_03: And I know he's, you know, he's solid and whatnot, but he also cut a lot of weight. Ray was 90 plus kilo at the time. So, which I'm assuming he's not going to be this time, just from discussion where I put on a little weight since me and him. And I put on a little bit since me and him pulled, and I'm right there at that 85 kg mark. So, I mean, we might as well step on a scale right now. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And you are confident he's going to just go one way? Yeah, I'm not going to be on the B side. I know, look, he's a good arm wrestler. Like I said, I'm not going to be able to show him nothing he ain't ever felt before. But what he felt by those guys beating him is what he's going to feel for me. You know, I'm...
SPEAKER_03: call it cocky call it overconfident i was cordial coming into this justin bishop did a interview with me you know i was complimentary i was um you know expressing my um respect for him and then everything that's come out of his mouth since was i'm beneath him you know
SPEAKER_03: I'm beneath him because he has a huge YouTube following. I've got bigger wins than he's got under his belt. You know, he's... Who did you beat? Just to inform people? Well, just... Almost everybody over here. But, like, when I went to Poland, it was a rough showing after my match with Vlad. But... Or after my match with David...
SPEAKER_03: do you say his name um no no no i broke my thumb in a match versus log i uh tried to slip and he didn't let go of my thumb and i yanked out really hard and he and he actually broke my thumb down by the base where uh it was like on the interior
SPEAKER_03: yeah and uh the problem was i didn't even get the slip so i ended up having i didn't get the straps because i elbow thought at the same time the micro files that are called as lottie is tough um another question i want to ask where are you compared to uh when you were active right now i'd say i'm like on the power side i'm pretty close i'd give myself 80 85 um
SPEAKER_03: It's up there. Just judging off my lifts, it's tough because I lift, I train completely different than I ever have. So I'm doing a lot different lifts now and more table time. And what did your training partners say when you train with them last week? Did they think that you have good chance of beating?
SPEAKER_03: uh right there there wasn't a person there that said they wouldn't put money on it if it was on arm bets like guy that no one there thought i would lose this match so um he's going to be proving a lot of people wrong if he does um it it's definitely definitely going to be um interesting in the first grip you never gripped up with somebody before
SPEAKER_03: uh you really don't know what you're gonna what really no you as much as you train for that person you really won't know until you get a hold of their hand so you feel it you'll find some holes yeah do you think that how do you see douglas compared to your match with uh ryan different
SPEAKER_01: Different style of puller. His back pressure looks super solid. His hand is kind of wobbly from the matches that I have seen in the previous. If you go inside with him, he's most dangerous there. That's pretty much most likely that's where I'm going to go. I don't have a plan like I had with Ryan where I said I'm going to toe-crawl him. I'm really excited. I want to see how strong he is, how strong he comes out of the gate. But...
SPEAKER_01: Even if he comes out too strong, best of five, I'm not worried in the slightest. If I will feel like, oh my God, there's too much, and even if I change something and that doesn't work, then I'll be very, very surprised. I have a lot of weapons now. I'm pretty much in the best shape I have ever been. I spend this whole time just preparing for this match. I have taken off
SPEAKER_01: two days of training one was because i was sick and one was because i needed to take it off uh since pretty much since my last super match in december so uh that's all i'm doing uh i i like i give respect to my opponents like i train hard i take like this is my last match this is the most serious match i had uh
SPEAKER_01: right now i feel my right like he he needs to be extremely strong like i know exactly how strong he needs to be to to to show me something that i haven't felt before and i'll be very surprised if he is and i hope i hope for a good match i uh if people buy this i want them to see a good match and i always bring out good match if it's uh if it's close if it's not close you know it will not be right so you are saying that
SPEAKER_02: Douglas to beat you, he needs to dominate you. And you don't expect him to be that strong enough to dominate you. And you are saying that if it is not domination, then it's going to be closer. And once it's closer, once you get engaged, then you're going to win that match. Is that correct? If I stop the match, I'll win it. It doesn't matter which round it is. I'll win it. I'm 100% sure of it.
SPEAKER_01: uh if he if i can't stop him like you know he's just too that much for me that's you know that's arm wrestling that's fine but i just don't feel i don't feel like it could be like that i'll he he will learn he will learn on 21st of january we'll talk so but like i'm giving like that i'm giving you like i i i trained so hard for this like really like i trained like there's no excuses coming from me
SPEAKER_01: i feel excellent my right arm is pretty much best it's ever been i feel really strong that is my gift to you like you don't want to face someone who's shitty you want to face someone who's strong and i know you've been working hard and i hope we will have a good match if it's one-sided either way it's a bad match in my opinion if we can have a war we'll have a war
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, my plan is just to step on your head, though. Like, I don't plan on losing at all. So, you know, I think if you win, it's going to be in an absolute dogfight. I just don't see the match stopping.
SPEAKER_03: You know, I wouldn't be training as hard as I have if I didn't respect you, though. Like, I'm not coming into this match and taking you lightly by no means. I'm just that confident right now. And I just, you know, I know everybody doesn't look the part. I just don't, the eye test doesn't,
SPEAKER_03: There's zero, zero intimidation. I don't feel just the matches and everything. So I'm fully, fully confident coming into this. You know, I was able to train with Artem. He's pulled with you. I kind of can get it. I know you won that match, but I can kind of get a little bit of a gauge of where you are. And I expect you to be a little stronger than you were then, but he is well, because that was quite a while ago.
SPEAKER_01: know and i think it's i i think that you're saying you don't really have a game plan coming into this and that you plan on going inside i just i have a game i have a game plan my game plan is i'm going to put my technique on your technique and we'll see where the balance lies i have a game plan for sure and i will change it if needed to but it's not like
SPEAKER_01: I'm not going for your weakest link. I'm going for your strongest link in this one, to be honest.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think you know what my strongest link is, though. That's the thing. That's the benefit I had of not having footage out there over these last couple years. Doesn't mean I ain't been in the gym. Doesn't mean I haven't been training. You know, there's people that said, what did I do? Does it deserve to get a match like this? Well, then they just don't know. They just don't know. And I don't have to prove myself to them at all. They can watch what's going to happen in a week, and they'll see why I got this match.
SPEAKER_03: know forcing uh your technique on me but then i hear a lot of once i stop the match i get i get what your plan is you want to stop the match and try and gas me out um and you think that inside is my best um yeah i think i think you're gonna be um and it may be that may be where i go so i just don't think the angle
SPEAKER_02: You're really going to know the angle that I'm going at until you grab a hold of me. Then you're going to be like, oh, shit. Nah. It's not going to be oh, shit. The only part, Douglas, I didn't understand with this. You are saying strength-wise, you are at your 85% and you are this confident. If you were close to 100%, I would understand. But when you say pretty close and 85%, the 15% is...
SPEAKER_02: I mean, how to say, in the Olympic weightlifting, people lift 150 kilo, and then when they add two and a half kilo, which is 1.7%, they go, and then they stay. So even that the 1.7% is making that difference, either calculation may not be right when you say 85%, or you are thinking that this is the weight
SPEAKER_03: that you are lifting but at the table you are more effective i don't know i didn't understand that part is it the second one yeah i'm way more effective at the table and applying what i don't know what i've said yeah yeah yeah but as far as power goes i felt like i was that far ahead of where he's at right now anyway so 85 still going to be enough now if he got me in the april event
SPEAKER_03: there would be no chance. If I had a couple more months under my belt, he's getting five, he's getting what? I had seven weeks of training, five of it, heavy training, and 10 days of that I spent with a sinus infection, sick as a dog. No excuse, because that's not even, I was just letting you know how- Why did you bring it up? Why did you bring it up? You told me you were sick. You just said you were sick. Let's rewind the video. You just said you were sick. Yeah, I said I was sick for one day. I was sick for one day. Okay, I
SPEAKER_01: i'm sorry i brought it up my point is my point is four weeks five weeks six weeks you're still getting this version you better beat me now because you won't beat me in three months i i can't wait till that's like and you give me a rematch i need a rematch i'll be that much stronger no they will they will not be in a rematch this is the shot you guys have you guys wanted this match and i said it okay now no more shots
SPEAKER_02: This is the shot, eight days later. What time is it? 8.24. Eight days later, this time it will be probably round two or round three, because yours is opening match and it's 8.24 here. Ada Kulov, the match is going to start exactly eight days later. We are about to find out, unless it is a dogfight that we don't know what's going to happen.
SPEAKER_03: he goes three two then he will not end it in 24 minutes for sure so after this match you're gonna after this match you're gonna have to throw somebody at me like bozeder or something like that i'm actually coming for something bigger ray is going to be a good stepping stone okay okay he is just the beginning beginning to warm up just back into it i mean john took the i'm nowhere near what john is but i'm just off his trajectory he took a step with chant shaw back in then a couple guys and then he grew to getting back to where um
SPEAKER_02: you know, arguably the top guy in his class again. That's where I'm headed. That's, you know, he's, Ray's just the start of a big 2023. Yeah, good comeback. Yeah. I can't imagine that eight days later, right now I'm closing my eyes, trying to, okay, here is the stage, and Douglas there, Ray is there,
SPEAKER_03: I just can't see what's happening. I don't know. Hey, what he's gonna hear when I bust his hand back is, Opa! I'm gonna yell it out so that he can feel what it feels like to be on the other side of it. You should say like, you should say like, like how to say, you should say like, imitate me or something, you know, just, you need to say, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: yeah see like for example for example like uh like Devon Lara kept calling Evgeny like even gay even gay you know all the time yeah yeah intentionally and now the other other other other program with Ermes he called him like erm not arm s s equals s arm and arm you know yeah
SPEAKER_02: So I told Hermes, if they ever pull, you know, just, you know, if we can get the position, I say this front of Devon as well, just to left, you know, just to steer the pot, you know, I say, Hermes, if you get in position, you know, tell him what's my name, what's my name, you know, the same as Muhammad Ali did it, you know, the guy was calling him like clay, clay, clay, and then he was just beating him. He's like, say my name, you know, say my name.
SPEAKER_03: I watched that podcast. I watch all your podcasts. I saw that interaction. It was pretty good. It was insanely funny. I died. You go to King's Move, I break your arm, my friend. He's like, what? I go to Canada, end your career. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to break bones in your elbow. There's trash talking between me and Ray, but
SPEAKER_03: You know, there's a lot of fake humbleness out there. There's a lot of people that are, you know, they tell you they want you to win. And then behind your back, they don't. There's a lot of people that act humble. In reality, they're not. And we've seen it with some recent guys that are these polite, I'm honored to be on the table with you. And then they scream in your face when they get on stage. And, you know, no matter what happens with,
SPEAKER_03: my match with ray his first beers on me i'm coming to compete with this dude i want to rip his arm off this isn't i'm not i'm not up there to make i'm not up there to be his best friend on stage and i'm gonna pat his head when we're done and then i'm gonna go buy him a beer i'm gonna destroy you so bad man all right i'm sorry i i feel bad i i i i don't want to be the mean guy but oh my god i'm just gonna
SPEAKER_02: it's not going to be good guy good guy doug is a good guy he's going to buy you that he's treating you not that i support alcohol i don't drink alcohol but you are drinking your champagne alone it's my champagne it's my victory
SPEAKER_02: yeah let's see let's see oh i can't believe you know just only eight days let's go whatever it is i enjoy it i saw our mustang and it will be getting only better and let's enjoy it so can we talk about the other matches a little bit if you don't have anything to intimidate each other yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: You just say that you're going to destroy him and then Ramos is just like always classical. He doesn't get angry. Oh, man, I'm going to destroy you. He's nervous. That is nervousness of what you're seeing. That is not confidence. Ray has gotten too big for his britches. I've had a lot of people message me saying humble Ray, and I got all these people in the comments that are his fanboys talking about, oh, he's humble already. This dude lost his shit over a playful video.
SPEAKER_03: I'm not here to go be friends with him before this match. Me and him have even talked about that. After the match, it's all good. Right now, I want to rip his freaking arm off. So this is, you know, that what you're seeing, he's nervous, 100% nervous. And I know this for a fact through multiple third parties. It's not me. What I hear is he said he's going to destroy you.
SPEAKER_02: that's what i mean i heard from you guys i'm using those right from the first day the first thing about the prediction from his mouth i said can you beat him he said oh i'm gonna destroy him and the first thing i heard from you i'm gonna humble him so that that is why only those two words i'm using is harmless and so well just the other day you told me he was scared of me and
SPEAKER_01: I'm just messing with you, dude. I had to get that look out. He's like, did I say it? Did I actually say it? I was like, why would I say such a thing, you know? But you like the stuff sometimes, so I wanted to hit you with one. Yeah, yeah, it's good, it's good, it's good. Yeah, because I always use the stress of the athletes and throw them.
SPEAKER_03: well it's good that you have extra energy for me yeah that's good yeah i'm super pumped but a lot of these guys you have on here are afraid to say what they truly feel you know they want to be they want to show the respect and i'll give him all the respect afterwards i'm not going to like it's not i'm not going to make a show of it you know that's not what it's not what this is about this is about this is how i get myself ready for a match this is how i get myself ready i tell you what what if
SPEAKER_02: Those super heavyweights were like as good trash talkers as you guys. The arm wrestling would just boom to the roof. There was only a few guys up there, you know, just doing that very well. I mean, not everyone has to do. Khabib doesn't talk trash, you know, that we need those calm guys as well. But you two are, you know, amazing.
SPEAKER_01: uh yeah okay i'm gonna ask you guys wait wait wait wait wait wait doug said i'm nervous of course i'm nervous you know i'm nervous that keeps me humble the nervousness that keeps me humble have you seen your videos lately your videos ain't humble yannis even had to get on the ground with his camera facing up saying you act like you're on some type of mountain right now looking down on everybody
SPEAKER_01: Old Ray was humble. I'm super humble. Old Ray was humble. There's no chance he will beat me. There's no chance he will beat me. You'll ask for a rematch. You'll ask for a rematch. You'll ask Engin. Engin will say no. Then someone else, and they're like, ah. And I said, I'm like, maybe for a million dollars. I'm too humble to pull for less. He will ask for a rematch.
SPEAKER_02: all the time i will say no no i will end up blocking right right exactly exactly and that's the last we've heard of doug well we don't have to worry about that scenario so we're good good thing as humble as like uh i created the small mountains and the bigger ones stayed came from my father who passed away or something so there was there's a a
SPEAKER_03: I'm a private conversations that happened when this match was getting set up and I won't divulge because they're private and I don't do that, but there was a reason why I said I wanted to humble him and I had legitimate reason. So, um, you know, that is conversation between, uh, parties that, you know, like I said, I will keep private, but this is which he was involved in. Um, you know, and he knows, he knows why I'm saying this and it,
SPEAKER_01: I have no idea what you are saying. I have no idea. I'm not going to say it. I'm not going to say it. You said you're going to destroy him or something probably. I have literally no idea. Oh, yes.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah, this is Yeah, this is conversation conversation for another time. But guys, come on, come on, come on. Where are we going? Just come on. Just just pull and just get everything at the table. You know? Yeah, let's go. That's the plan. Let's talk. Yeah, let's go. Let's talk some matches. Listen, listen, Ramos. You think Douglas is humble? No, of course he's not.
SPEAKER_01: he's telling stories about guys with these bees that are more accomplished and you know it's i'm more about it you're more accomplished amazing more accomplished yeah yeah okay great okay wow wow wow wow i can't wait it's already i'm stressed wow and you are only 106 in next week
SPEAKER_02: let's start some of them i'm not going to ask you douglas the reason is i know i know most of them oh really wow okay it's good it's good you are you are a good professional i know nothing about those matches i follow no one he doesn't see you provoking him we cannot finish the program but i'll talk about everybody else so humble
SPEAKER_03: everybody else you don't know who I am but I promise you in eight days from now you're gonna know who I am I'm gonna be it's gonna be nightmares man after this this is gonna shut down that 16 and 0 streak where you've been riding high on this cockiness and I promise you you're gonna feel something from this weight class that you ain't never felt you better put on weight you better not walk in there at 83 kilos like you said you are you better come in there heavy and cut I promise you that
SPEAKER_02: Wow, wow, wow. I'm good. I'm really good. I'm really good. I just hope you don't pick up another injury, you know, because you've been famous of getting those in some big matches. So stay safe. Stay safe, Doug. Okay. Let's start. Start with you, Ramos. Efe Klemek and Efe. Efe, in fact, is sent to B side by Efe. But with two fouls. I think...
SPEAKER_02: I think I've had the position, and Eitbek fouled out. But Eitbek ended up with gold medal after the camera check with fouls against Sundays. Is there a weight limit? Is there a weight limit? Are they pulling 115? There is no, but I think that they both are about 115, a little bit over or something, you know. Left arm, I'm thinking, I think he'll be way better there, so.
SPEAKER_03: So how do you see? FA as well. I think, you know, this was one of the matches I'm not super versed on, but I like to be educated when I come into, because I knew we were going to have these conversations. So I talked to Paul about FA and his opponent, and he knew more about FA. And I did a little bit of research, watched some video. I do like FA in this one.
SPEAKER_02: I love that, what you just said that you told me Paul and he tells you this. See, I love that. I love that. Do you know why I love that? It is because East and West just getting like this, they get to know each other. They go back, they talk about what they experienced. This is what it is. This is what I wanted to accomplish. I hated all those North Americans to pull there forever, except every selected ones. While we all pull here in WAF,
SPEAKER_02: with together and only the again the selected ones meet each other but now the things are changing this is the beauty of the world we have only one world and we are this like this i love it i love it yeah and now new guys are coming more yeah already already brandon assessor will be competing again yeah yeah i mean everything is up but listen i i'm not the like
SPEAKER_02: um how to say savior of the world or something i i'm limited more the community supports me more i can serve you understand i'm i'm i'm depending on the community if they like what i do let them support me if they don't support me i will be limited it is not like some oh are you threatening us like like how stupid you need
SPEAKER_02: to think that I'm threading. I'm just saying that I will give to you as much as you support me. This is very clear. I'm not a millionaire or something. Anyways, so. Oh, this one is very interesting. Just I ask with the percentage. I don't want you guys to get detailed in this. I don't know if you know these guys very well, but Douglas versus Rymond. I'll let you take the floor.
SPEAKER_03: 100% Raimon. 100% Raimon? And this is the humble guy, right? He just said, I'm so humble. I'm humble. And 100%. Not even 1%. At the same time, you want him to be not fake. See? You don't like him when he is totally, you know, himself. That is fake, Engin, to say I'm humble and then not be humble. My point is... My point is, you know...
SPEAKER_03: I'll say 99%, okay? I'll be little less humble. I'll be a little more humble than him. I'll say 99% of one. 99% one? Just because you want to be nice to him, okay. Yeah. Okay. Because I'm humble. I think I stopped being nice. Yeah, he's humble. I'm not. Clearly, I'm not. Okay. I'm 1% more humble than him. Yeah. Okay, let's go with Curtis.
SPEAKER_03: Cameron versus Rob Calvary. This time I go with Douglas first. So this, it's a tough one. This one's a tough one for me because I watched a lot out of, and I've seen, you know, I've seen him pull Todd Hutchins. I've seen him practicing with Devin. Devin has a way to make everybody look like superheroes at practice though. So that's tough to go by practice footage or anything Devin does.
SPEAKER_03: He likes to go inside. Zurab looks big right now. He looks really strong right now. And I'd say if Curtis is anything what Devin says, if he comes in better than he was when he pulled Todd Hutchings, it's going to be an absolute war. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: it's definitely going inside i think zarab has a shorter a shorter lever so if he can if he gets down on his forearm some and gets him in a deep sunk in hook i think they're up wins if you are saying a little more you're just pushing me out of angle like this then drop may lose but if surabhi is totally locked himself like this you are saying that drop has more chance
SPEAKER_03: Oh yeah, if he's coiled in, I'm going to go, I'm going zero. That's why I think it's probably 50-50 until I see that first go, you know, the first match. I think Curtis has a really strong bicep and he's got a lot of side pressure. So if he can keep it center table, I think that's his best chance. Yeah, for a second, I want the chat to, you know, appreciate. I mean, it's not, you don't have to, but this guy sold Arun.
SPEAKER_02: is our graphic designer. This guy is a great guy. This guy is a very professional guy. So in front of everyone, I want to thank him. Thank you, Sol. Thank you, my friend. And Raimonds, how do you see this one? So port shop is unknown factor for me. I have seen in full, but on the video, just like Doug said, it's very hard to pinpoint where the strain gap is, in all honesty.
SPEAKER_01: But I'm going to pick Zurab as my favorite in this one. We'll see after the first because you really don't know. You just don't know. Zurab's left looked insane. It's left arm, right? No, right arm. Oh, right arm. Okay. Oh, yeah. Because I was thinking it looked insane versus Efe and it looked terrible against Petrenko. It looked insanely good against Ryan Bowen. But...
SPEAKER_01: yeah okay i'm gonna pick zero a slight favorite maybe a few percent and we'll see i i think it's gonna be a war i think they're gonna end up here i think uh europe has great endurance and he can pull for days and we have seen it before so should be a good match and raymond you may know the turkish guy i know you know probably robert baxter and do you know ahmed no yeah i don't know
SPEAKER_02: By face, by face, by face, I know. Ahmed is the guy that won Robert Baxter's weight category in Grand Masters. Okay. Yeah, yeah. And the previous year in Romania, Robert was the winner. Yeah, this time Ahmed won and they are very close. So now they are going to face each other. It's an interesting match. We'll see. Yeah, it's going to be interesting, right?
SPEAKER_02: was that it's a legend match or no it's a i mean it is just just a match you know just just like yes yeah this is for legend category i don't see a lot of people on this earth like it needs to be like cobra rose sharon remez like gary goodrich idar ellen fisher dave patson you know this this
SPEAKER_02: um maybe maybe lucky's here soon he's making a comeback so maybe lucky yeah yeah i already asked not kiss but he he was not available then he he was not he was like right after the kobe time so there was some problems about kobe so probably he choose not to but okay do you you have any idea about this match like this the backs the robert baxter one yeah and i'm a general yeah
SPEAKER_03: i got robert as a slight favorite i have a feeling that this means a whole lot to him um he's i'm i'd say the patriotic side of me is what sways that just a tad uh because i think they're so close but like 55 45 you know um robert robert is one of the nicest guys i don't know if you ever met
SPEAKER_02: the in the communities yeah super nice super nice guy super honest guy super i don't know like i like one of the best guys that i met i ever met in the community and very very strong guy he's not super super muscular but he's built big tall and he's very technical very explosive you know he's very very good very good guy and he and he's pulled him before so he he he's not coming in
SPEAKER_02: like me and Ray are not really having no clue. Same for Ahmed as well. Ahmed is also, he started armwrestling very late, but he couldn't do something in the senior categories internationally. But in the masters and grandmasters, he has won titles. So he's also very strong, very strong. We will see, you know, we will see. He's my countrymate. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He's like my brother, but as an organizer, you know, I'm just not sure about this. So let's go another one. Chance Joe, David Arabuli, Rymond. You know, you know, you know, David? Yeah, I know David. David, like, I'm... Chance is looking insanely good lately. I love him.
SPEAKER_01: He's a great puller, but I feel like Georgians will come in really ready. And I met David in King of the Table in Dubai when 11 and 11 match was going on. And he was like already like getting better and better and better. And I think he was there with Vitaly also. Yeah. So I'm picking him as favorite in this one. No, no, no. But he pulled on table with everyone and he just, you know, he
SPEAKER_01: he was versatile and i i feel like he's you don't mean the qualification event you're talking about no no no no no no super no no no just just he was there when was it when was it which one was it i think last time i met him was vitaly and uh and dave pulled so oh okay okay okay yeah yeah yeah i i think lately he said david david
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he said he thinks he's going to win. You said you think to beat him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Slight favor. But chance is looking better and better, but I don't know where his motivation right now. He's facing Ryan, and I think he will prepare crazy not to lose to Ryan by any means, you know. So he will come in great shape. He's always explosive. He's always good with that top roll. But I feel like David is better than Zurab was.
SPEAKER_02: And I think he will... He has better... He's about 20 kilo heavier than... Yeah, and he's also bigger. Also bigger. But the only problem is where he is going is like stylistically is the best spot for Chance. Once Chance has his wrist curved and someone is diving in, the guy is just like a wolf. I don't... What? I don't think Chance loses a match. I think he wins his 3-0.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. I don't know who's going to win. But stylistically, if David is going inside, stylistically, I'm not saying that nobody can hook and beat Chance. But going, diving in against Chance, I mean, I saw John try to jump in. I saw Tatashins went there and then Chance was beating Tatashins and then
SPEAKER_02: Tab's pronator stopped him while he's going, his wrist was started like this, not because of his arm. If Tab didn't have so good pronation, even when he dive in, he still protected his own pronator. So Chance couldn't control Tab's pronator, but attacking here wasn't effective against him. So just going inside there, I mean, that is, if David does that,
SPEAKER_02: that he will be doing incredible job but we don't know maybe they are showing us like this and maybe he will go outside i have no idea you never know you know where i mean whatever video they put on youtube may not be representing the game plan so that's just what i am thinking but we will see we will see like it's a very good match but we will see and and david may be stronger than chance but i'm just talking about stylistically
SPEAKER_01: and Gabriela versus Barbara Ramos. It's for me, it's hard not to pick Gabby as the favorite, but I'm kind of like I'm supporting Gabby in this one. But I think Barbara is the favorite, just the frame and on the build and everything else. And she's been so dominant and just just looks ridiculous, just makes super heavyweight women's class look easy. And I saw like
SPEAKER_01: In the last championship, Gabi, it wasn't that easy for Gabi. It was when she got the strap and everything else, but her wrist was giving up. So we'll see what Barbora can bring. I would love if Gabi would win.
SPEAKER_02: I would love if Gabrielle would win. That would be amazing. But I think Barbora is the favorite. If you just make a poll, I would bet you that 90% will say Gabrielle is going to win. People don't know about Barbora. And some people are showing Barbora some table practice from one and a half year ago with Egle. This guy is only like 22 years old now. And he's just progressing like...
SPEAKER_03: Crazy, you know, and those polls are mainly, those polls are mainly popularity contests, not, you know, 90% of them, you know, and I'll prove that next weekend. Oh, is that why Ramos is leading the poll against you? He's got 100,000 subscribers, of course. Most likely. Most likely. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Mbora, for me, in that match, uh,
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to, I'm going to go with Gabby slightly with the experience, but if Labora has a, if she posts really hard, it's going to be real. It's going to be really hard for, for, for Gabby. She's so much shorter and so much in that lever length. And, but I think, I think Gabby's got a, a few tricks up her sleeve. I just don't, um,
SPEAKER_03: I see it being a war though. Like it's not going to be easy. It's either, it's either going to be before like, like is just that good and goes right through her or it's a war. And if it's a war, I'm going to go with Gabby. I was normally Gabriella Ramos is going like more like sideways. The last video that she posted for training, she was doing, you know, you know, outside move, you know, and I mean,
SPEAKER_02: if that is the way that she planned to compete against barbara she did the right job because i don't see i mean if you go sideways maybe because they got douglas this girl whenever you see her like face to face you will be very impressed very brave yeah yeah you will be like wow you know she's
SPEAKER_02: strong she's like six two about 125 kilos these are the numbers she gave me again hang in there remember gabi is sitting next to doug yeah oh okay yeah i don't know i don't know what why why that matters but if that's the request i will do it but but grimos do you realize that the way that bible see let's accept the truth that the woman and men are
SPEAKER_02: pulling different men is like more with wrist and the woman is more like the next joint is really created more sensitive and so that's they often ended up with fingers but this girl marbora is one of those a few with the arm muscles like a man you know
SPEAKER_02: Sorry, but I see men arm wrestling a little bit more higher quality than women. So don't attack me, any woman on the field or something. But the girl, even when she goes hook and everything, she's just arm wrestling. I mean, so good. She knows what she's doing. And it's a good opportunity for Gabriela if she beats her now. A year from now or two years from now, I don't think that anyone
SPEAKER_01: the earth will be beating her i say this because it's for the future so i'm not taking side because i talked about this match is very very close match but i told this job also gabriella you know a year from now that's pretty much right now is the last match of female armors on that uh you know for for the top of the crown who's the 11th of arm wrestling female you know like after that match like
SPEAKER_02: Whoever wins, and if it's not the close match, what do we do, you know? There is only one thing that if Egle White could gain some weight instead of 83 kilos last time, or Gabriela also told me that after this match, she will be targeting both categories, 80 and plus. So if she goes 80, and Egle versus Gabriela at the same weight,
SPEAKER_02: is good match another good match is sarah beckman versus eglet which i am planning to set yeah that's good anyway so let's go to the next one next one next one next one all those matches are incredible i don't know where okay craig toller versus david kamushka
SPEAKER_01: it's hard to see the david samushia loses like i think he's just that much strong like craig is insane his hit is insane but there are there are things that david samushia can do to most armistice that's very hard for others to do but craig looks insane like craig's looking better and better and better and better and that hit is just vicious i i have to pick the champion as the favorite
SPEAKER_02: i have to pick the champion but i think craig is dangerous like you you can't deny that craig is ridiculously dangerous in this match yes yes if he pulls in right direction explosive enough there is a chance like the way that the way that pauline pulled against samusha even though he was heavier but that direction the point very explosive i'm sure that paul also shares everything he knows
SPEAKER_01: with uh craig another question you are saying that david is gonna win this one who on the earth under 85 kilo can beat davos in your opinion then blood in good shape it's gonna happen in eight days i think blood will can be ah doc just chill man we're not there we're not there i i don't think you are talking about me and you
SPEAKER_03: not talking about me and you and i do it oh i do understand the levels what do you what what what are you saying that doctor is saying that in eight days we will see yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: he's beating guys that we're losing in that we're losing in wal so like it's not like we ain't pulled the same levels brother like yeah i know i know you see here you go again with the this levels thing like what there's a lot of guys that have gone over there and been successful and a lot of guys that have come over here and not been successful so we're talking craig two year i just practiced with the dude okay i've practiced with ron i've practiced with you know all these guys i've practiced i've
SPEAKER_02: The way Craig feels right now is stupid. 60 strong, right? 60 strong. If I had money to put on any match on this card, myself, it would be on this one. Wow. Craig's going to win. Wow. It would really shake the world, you know, because on the paper, he looked underdog. But from the videos that I saw,
SPEAKER_02: Drake looks very, very dangerous. I see the potential. That he can win the match if he pulls explosive enough to the right direction, then there is a, you know, chance that he's gonna go. I think it's going to go whatever direction he wants it to go. And honestly, I think I think with somebody in his weight class with a similar size frame to him.
SPEAKER_02: i just don't underestimate david oh no no no no david's insane he's insane i just feel like any dimension he wants you know when you talk like that i hope i i hope that craig craig is not gonna think that way because the guy is david star misha is six strong you know six strong you know
SPEAKER_03: The direction they both want to go in is what I'm getting at. They're both going to go in a fairly similar direction. It's right into Craig's power. And I just feel like he can shut off your pronator so well that even in a hook, you know, your pronator, your riser, and all that stuff does come into play. And if you can control that aspect of it,
SPEAKER_03: then it changed. Look, when I was in Poland, David won the class I was in. It was a nightmare class. We had Shimbolat, Magdan Shamaev, we had Monta Szymonas, David won, and then Sarunas, what's his name? I think he's from Lithuania. Yeah, he got second. The class was so deep. Carlos Tiete put Magdan Shamaev on the B side first round.
SPEAKER_03: And he had to come back through just to get, like, fifth place. I mean, that class, 78 KG class, like, 32 guys, and it was a nightmare that year. And David won the whole thing fairly easily. I don't underestimate David. I pulled him left-handed. He's unbelievable. Don't get me wrong. I'm not underestimating him. His left is just, like, alpha of his right, yeah. Oh, for sure, for sure. I'm not comparing those two. I'm saying I just ripped up with him left. That was it. But he...
SPEAKER_02: his he went right through everybody right-handed pretty much he didn't even get hung up so i'm by no means underestimating the beast yeah yeah i just think craig's that strong right now yeah yeah i see that i see that he's very strong and craig is super experienced super experienced you know great match set up on that one okay raymond's corey versus very don't spawn the left arm
SPEAKER_01: I haven't seen Fedez pull lefty in a long time. I've seen him pull righty when he's returned to AMC. Corey looked insane. I have to pick Corey in this one. The fighter is so experienced. He knows how to pull. I expected it to be a war and not only like hook war or some technical war as well.
SPEAKER_02: i like i think corey is ridiculous and i think i mean i mean it better be not a war for corey physically if it is a war the ferret is known with his endurance especially if he can go joint so i i see corey is like his chance winning his explosiveness and ferris chance of winning is just making the match going into the
SPEAKER_03: uh endurance for this this is just my my opinion yeah and and douglas i think it's one of the few matches that's going to go three two i think uh you know and not to say that the 30 matches are lopsided because you know there's you know sometimes it's inches that decide you know 301 way or the other but i think this is going to be one of the ones that goes three two possibly
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. I'm leaning towards Corey just because of the, one of the reasons is the layoff. But this is Farid right-handed, you said, or left? No, left, left. Farid's right-handed. Yeah, you know, I know Farid's big right now. So I just think, you know, that Corey's last left-handed match really gave him a whole other level of confidence.
SPEAKER_02: and and uh raymond uh hang on i have 10 minutes i have to do some stuff still yes okay i will i will ask you first then then you can go alijan petrenko i asked you the first your opinions and then after you leave we asked you douglas i'm the biggest fan of alger murato i think alger murato takes it i think he's one of those insane
SPEAKER_01: humans insane armors are on the planet as strong as petrenko looked against zurab what alijan did in super heavyweight class and he wasn't even preparing like people gonna pull there was insane i think i think he takes it in a deep cook i don't think he gets pressed i think yeah if petrenko beats him petrenko's left is way way stronger on the strongest on the planet petrenko's win
SPEAKER_02: I mean, like WAF left arm super heavyweight doesn't really represent the very best of the left arm in the world. So, I mean, to say that Oleg Petrenko to beat Alijan would make him like one of the best in the world. I think it does. I think it does just because Petrenko won 95 kilos, but it was like a few years ago.
SPEAKER_01: And there's not that much left arm pulling happening right now. Alijan just showing that he's under 100 kilos can go up to super heavyweight class of the biggest, where it doesn't mean maybe sometimes the strength, but it's just difficult because of the arm size and everything else. He's just different human.
SPEAKER_01: would say national like jock at this point i'm i'm very excited to see him pull and you know maybe maybe i'm wrong but i think he's up there with the best of the best left arms on the planet he showed that when he pulled 80 kilos he destroyed the competition so easily it was ridiculous yeah yeah and and uh i i think that's insane back i think
SPEAKER_01: everything's going to happen in that match i'm i'm picking no winners in that one except the community because it's going to be one of the best matches ever i think so i think absolute war i think it's going to be where do you expect the match to go i don't know i don't know everywhere i hope it's everywhere i hope it's inside outside flop wrist press everything i hope it's not sure i i think ferret is just only try
SPEAKER_01: go outside. But I don't know, maybe like he can get inside, but like if that doesn't work with Gennady, but Gennady can pull in any position needed to. We know that. Yeah. Yeah. Even if he loses the hand, he's still going to stay there and try and then try to get in. And, you know, I just hope it's going to be. What's going to happen if they both go outside? Who is going to survive? I feel like I feel like
SPEAKER_01: ferret's wrist is going to survive like there hasn't been a boring genatic within your match ever in all the super matches like think about it like every match you pull is insane match win or lose so i hope it's the same i hope we don't break the streak there okay let's go to another one rustam baba and pauline ruslan it's hard to bet to get one of the greatest of all time you know and uh
SPEAKER_01: I don't think anyone can disagree, you know. Paul looked insane versus Samusha. He looked insane versus Gantanaza. But it's still a long shot between those guys and Rustam Bobaio. The only thing that is against Rustam right now is coming back from quite a retirement. Not retirement, but taking a break. But every time he, like, he was so bored at pulling at 90, 95 kilos, he went up to face super heavyweights.
SPEAKER_02: not super successful but not a lot of guys can do that i don't think i don't think he was so bored but there was good probably opportunity in the uh top eight that that's i don't think he was bored i saw him also losing against an expression it's just an expression oh okay okay okay i thought that you meant it's okay uh
SPEAKER_01: I think Nur Dalet is the favorite. I want to see fire in Mindaugas' eyes. If that happens, Mindaugas can... He has endurance. He has, you know, his crazy arm strength. So, we'll see. But I think Nur Dalet is the favorite in that one. So, you are saying he's going to top-roll him? Yeah, yeah. If anyone tries to go inside in the same weight, at 75 kilos, against Mindaugas...
SPEAKER_02: probably big mistake you know right to try to hook him in that that category is not many people pro nature is insane I saw him I saw uh Kerkasov tried to hook him at the Moldova event third round he just hold him like this like beat him like this and and only I saw Arthur Makarov probably five six times beating him and one time lost anyway so let's go to do another one uh
SPEAKER_02: the God versus Heraclitus? John. That's it. John Berzank. You confident? No, no confidence. Your mind is talking? The mind or the heart of Rimon? Both. Both, okay. So you are saying... I have seen and I have witnessed the truth. I know, I know exactly
SPEAKER_02: what john brzenk is and if he comes in healthy it's a bad day for every single person on this planet so question for you you were there how did you feel before right they announced oleg petrenko versus john brzing i i still thought that john was going to take it i still thought the job after you saw petrenko's performance against did you not feel like you know oh no
SPEAKER_01: yeah but i i kind of felt that zurich was injured i thought zero wasn't 100 so i yeah yeah but of course i'm like oh god he looks insane but john john has made everyone look weak for years i really thought that i really thought that i think i was gonna destroy
SPEAKER_02: john i was like oh how dare you hang it again like at night you can't go to sleep because you you had that thought in your head you're like how could i how could i even think about it listen listen you i mean you see the guy the guy is like a machine and then john john you say okay this guy is incredible but physically he's not as he used to be oh no you say and then you are like oh okay okay yeah what do you know you know just like
SPEAKER_01: It's because we are fans of him, you understand? Heartful fans of him. It's still, it's because I'm a fan and just because what we have witnessed in the previous year and just John doesn't look like he's getting better and better and better. Better and better and better. And like, I know it actually has that one acid weapon and John can pull even if he loses his hand, he still has the pronator and back pressure. It's going to be a bad day for Rockwell. Corey West versus Arif Ertem.
SPEAKER_02: the last one jerry versus swedco jerry how do you expect the match you expect an easy victory or war i expect i i jerry's gonna lose his hand get it if he loses his hand he will get on on on uh
SPEAKER_02: So it goes on and just stay there. He's going to be all stretched out like this and then he's just going to finish it and longer the match goes, more to favor Jerry. Do you think that Raimon, do you think that Georgi made his game plan the way that you describe him? You think he's good going outside like that, you know, to beat him? Or do you think that he may go over Jerry's front either?
SPEAKER_01: like if he's like he's smart puller he knows it's the best scenario like of course everyone's instinct is to kind of run away but you will get trapped by jerry's shoulder and his press so i i think jerry is just that good dealing with those kind of pullers and i have like i have seen the wars that uh georgie has had and washed you know where it's
SPEAKER_01: let's be honest, it's not the same with the super heavyweights. The level is not the same. We all know that. The level is the same only when Alijan is competing? I said I might be wrong. I might be wrong as well. Tell me if it's not impressive that a 100-kilo guy can go there and just do that. It's insane. No, no, no. But what I am just saying is if Alijan or Petrenko beat Alijan, you say that he must be like
SPEAKER_02: one of the few the best in the world but i'm just saying not not few i would say top 20 my it's my top 20. top 20. and then and then oh no that's for sure you know that's for sure anyways so the last words are you gonna kick this guy's ass next week no i'm gonna i'm gonna beat his arm i'm not going near his ass okay yeah before we kick this guy out
SPEAKER_03: Do you want to say anything to him? Looking forward to it, Ray. I'm going to prove those doubts that you've been having. I'll show you why you've been having those doubts. You'll know. But no, I'm definitely looking forward to it, man. It's been interesting, to say the least, these last few months.
SPEAKER_02: It's happening. I definitely appreciate you hanging for putting it together. Give me a chance to... We will continue talking with you. The last predictions, we just couldn't handle this anymore. We cannot make him out. I'm too nervous. I'm also too nervous. I have to be. I need to stay humble. You know what? What is his darkness? He saw you. He saw your arms. He saw your confidence. And he just can't wait to go and train more.
SPEAKER_02: This is not easy. He's got to get bigger. This is what it's going to look like when I arm wrestle Ray right here. This is the size difference. Oh, okay. Damn it. Okay, guys. You are intimidated, Ramos. You take care of yourself, my friend. Yeah, I'll see you guys in Turkey. Bye. Yeah, next week. Okay, Douglas. Give me a second.
SPEAKER_03: that's your daughter yeah that's uh that's little douglas that's little douglas come over here real quick this little little dog oh little douglas yeah look just like me yeah hello hello i love you too son just saying hey all right okay i'll be done soon go ahead okay what was the last one you you predicted
SPEAKER_03: Let's go with Mendoza and Nurdale. Yeah, I think that's where we left off at. I'm going to go with Mendoza. I think I like he's a dog. I love that. I like his confidence. And I think. What we saw with him and Justin, I truly believe Justin was the stronger guy. Again, short preparation, not having
SPEAKER_03: The stamina, if I was Justin in that match, I would have laid down. I honestly probably would have strategically laid down that fourth match because the buckle was deciding that match every match. And they had like two or three restarts in that fourth match. And I think that was the deciding factor for the fifth match.
SPEAKER_03: Now, Mendoza has a crazy hand and knows how to get in the right position to give himself a chance at every match. So you never see him really just get run over. I think he stops the match and grinds it out. It's going to be close, though. They're both pretty evenly matched. Yeah. And John versus Irakli?
SPEAKER_03: I don't see John losing to this style of top role. I just. It's not going to give. I think it's actually going to be. I mean, it's going to stop because John hasn't been. He's not been explosive like that to the side. He's just been.
SPEAKER_03: hand control, gaining control, controlling center table, and then finishing the match. And he's even said it himself that he's changed his style over with this supermatch pool and the way he's been doing it over, you know, since he's been coming back. And I think he's figured something out. You know, I think he's made, as crazy as it sounds, for somebody, the GOAT,
SPEAKER_02: I think he's technically gotten even better strategic-wise. So I think this is another, I think it's a 3-0 match. I mean, technically, John being better, I mean, it is like against anyone in his category. I mean, there is nothing to compare. The only way to beat him is to dominate him, you know, with strength, right direction.
SPEAKER_03: and you know we will see we will see i think it's going to take a much bigger hand and a bigger frame person i think arachnid's frame like although he is carrying a lot of weight i just don't see his frame being that big he seems like a you know he's like an 85 kg frame guy 90 kg frame guy but with a lot of muscle and i think
SPEAKER_03: yeah like his frame yeah but not he's not his muscular about six three you know right yeah i know he's tall but it's just like his the broadness and the size of the size of him the physical size of him um i know he's not little by no means i just think john john's frame his hand strength and control is just going to be too much i don't think he's going to flop john over that's the only way he's losing that match
SPEAKER_02: I mean, sometimes, I mean, it's scary even to think the memory that John's arm has been experiencing, you know, that that arm handled, felt the pressures of Richard Lapkus, Gary Goodrich, Kulivdin, Alan Karev, Travis, Devon, Perich, Denis Diplenko, Andrei Pushkarsh, best in peace,
SPEAKER_02: And imagine the record, the muscle memory record that he has, you know. So if the guy is, I mean, he has always been too much for his category. The only reason the truth that today we are talking about if John wins or someone in his category wins is because the guy is today
SPEAKER_02: 58 years old, he's still very, very strong, but not like, let's say, 2006 prime, you know, the incredible shape that he was in. So, but still, if the guy is anywhere, if he can get a form anywhere close to where he was, the guy is the most dangerous man on the earth for his category, at least right now.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we'll see what happens with those stem cells. I mean, you see the way John pulls in the straps and even when somebody kind of... I don't know if I should say or not, but he said he feels his shoulder better. That's awesome. That's great to hear. I think the percentages go even up. But, you know, you say you see the way John's been pulling, the way he's pulling in the straps, even when somebody does get his hand, he's able to, the way he's using the straps, he's able to get it back. But you say that if shoulder is handling it,
SPEAKER_02: And yeah, it doesn't allow the arms to go. A lot of people think that it's just about arm, but this is your arm can be in the same angle, but it can move that way. It's all about the you know. Being able to being able to maintain that side pressure. That's one thing I I felt from that last practice that we had that. Yeah, we had. I forgot to ask you. Rhymes about Michael Douglas on that web that is.
SPEAKER_03: He did a prediction video of that on his YouTube page. He did a prediction video of that match. What did he say? I'm pretty sure he said he's going with Mike. Oh, he's going with Mike. Okay. How do you see that, Mike?
SPEAKER_03: There's a few things. There's just so many, so many outside factors that are playing into that match with where's Mike's bicep and they've been tested. He's cutting a lot of weight. And I, for one, know when you cut that kind of weight, the integrity of, you know, just the lack of, um, support around the muscles and pendants there.
SPEAKER_02: does change things. I think his rehydration process is going to play a huge factor into it, how he rehydrates. I see him today, just say like 260, like some time later he said he's 240, you know. So I think he is so much used to that, I think he's going to weigh 231, and I think he's going to pull minimum at 250 the next evening. This is what I am just expecting him. But
SPEAKER_03: would it still bring everything back? I don't know. It does. Does Angar Bhai have the tools to finish the match? Finish it. And I know he's a grinder. He's super strong. It's a toss-up for me. It's 50-50 to me because if Mike can stop the match at the pad, obviously before the pin, it's going to be...
SPEAKER_02: It's going to be an absolute war because I don't know if he has, if Ungarbaev has enough in that press. And I know he has a press. Can he finish it? The only thing I know about Ungarbaev, this guy is smart enough to handle that move. The question is, is he strong enough to finish that? But he's smart enough.
SPEAKER_02: Trust me. I mean, if I would pull on Garbev, I would be more afraid of his brain than anything else, you know. The guy is very, very, very, very smart guy. And he is very versatile. I have seen him poking Slayev. I have seen him with the dead risk beating Kurdesha.
SPEAKER_02: Alex Kurdesha, I have seen him top roll. I mean, the guy can pull it any direction. And the other day when I asked him on live show, when Michael was there, are you as good as your top eight shape that you pull with Levan Saginashvili, Alex Kurdesha and, you know, others. And he said, I'm stronger now. So that is now the things are very interesting. I don't know. Anything can happen.
SPEAKER_02: i think mike has some mike's got some of the strongest pronation out there people don't realize that just because he's just because they see the king's move they don't realize what he's doing while he's doing that he has some unbelievable pronation and of course someone like corey west is like having a problem against michael corey west right wrist is just super super strong when when john bernsing wanted to go outside directly he couldn't he was just like copying him you know like
SPEAKER_02: and and john had to go inside to catch him because he trust me if john could top roll him he would top roll him john trying to hook people you know 200 kilo people because he couldn't if he could get out of the hand of course john hook him but it is because john realized that he cannot go outside and then he is smart enough some people understand after they fail some people are smart enough to
SPEAKER_02: know before it's too late so john is of course one of those that you know realizes you know where he should go and where he shouldn't go so but i'm just saying my point if michael is taking courier's risk and of course the guy has incredible connection incredible yeah there's no doubt and i will never understand that you know people that uh doesn't give any credit to uh
SPEAKER_03: michael that that's that's interesting i don't understand that's just the social media stuff man mike mike mike's lost a couple matches after it but the matches mike's losing are not to chunks like those were also wars you know you've been the best guys in the world and they're talking about it if he loses again he needs to retire like what kind of crap is that the dude is competing against the best the best so yeah i mean those those guys are all of them and those are worse
SPEAKER_02: You don't see anyone going through, Michael, there's a wall. And as long as his shoulder is not here, but table level, I mean, I don't understand why people would give him shit for open arm top roll. Open arm top roll is perfectly fine. The problem is that if you go like here, and then the arm doesn't go, but as long as you're here, when your arm can come to the bed level, the open arm is also one of the styles of arm wrestling, you know. Anyway, so let's go to do,
SPEAKER_03: I like this one. And part of me wants to go, Yorgi, because he picked me to beat Ray. But people don't realize, like, so you've been talking about, you've been in some of your interviews and predictions on this match, you've been bringing up the fact that Yorgi might
SPEAKER_03: come here and instead of a full outside like yeah but whenever i said come here i'm not talking about hook right you still have your tornadoes and then yeah like yeah yeah but if it gets in there where jerry doesn't lose his wrist jerry's got one of the strongest hooks and like in the game people don't realize that still you didn't get my point just because you call somebody's tornado you are not in a book if you have stuff for later sure
SPEAKER_02: yeah i mean you you can you can just do this and beat people you don't have to give your tornado to be to be that to be in hook you need to turn in like this but if you are like this if somebody is trying to control your tornado but you just keep his wrist neutral like this and then turn his tornado and beat him the guy can never engage so what i'm just saying there needs to be a fine you know
SPEAKER_02: balanced you know that him to control here but not give his own pronator and then moving sideways
SPEAKER_02: of what dave used to do to him he would grab him low and control his wrist in in the past he was just going like this dave he was talking about dave chaffee but now dave is more like pronating pressure he's doing uh after he got toppled a few times so he realizes that you know okay you go here and then i go here so dave is not really using his wrist anymore but just grenade grenade it
SPEAKER_03: side pressure he's pressing you with the thumb side here jorge is going to have to keep dave out house outside his shoulder even with his shoulder outside his shoulder on the start he wants to be center table with him yeah if he if he lets dave get in here jerry jerry jerry i don't know my bad i keep that yeah yeah yeah i had i just mentioned dave so why not chatting normally yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, if he can separate Jerry some and get him outside his shoulder, he can finish him out here. He can. That's the interesting part is can he control center table? Can he get him to his side? That is where we understand where the match is going to go. You take Jerry out of his shoulder, there is a chance. Jerry puts his shoulder behind.
SPEAKER_02: That's where it's going to be. And this is one of those instances, what I was talking about with it could be, you know, it's a game of inches sometimes from 3-0 to one side and 3-0 the other way. Wow. That's going to be fun. I can't wait. I will just sit down and enjoy. Douglas, I don't think that we ever chat like this before in person.
SPEAKER_02: and it is it was very nice to uh discuss about arm wrestling with you and can't wait to meet you my friends next week and with you good luck same i wish raymond's good luck i'm organizer cannot take any sides and i know whose side you're on
SPEAKER_03: No, I appreciate it. And like, I really do appreciate the opportunity. It's the biggest stage in arm wrestling right now. And I think, uh, potentially, um, if it ain't already there, the biggest that there has been, like, it's, it's, it's, it's special what you're doing. Like, this is, um, I know you were talking about it earlier and there's going to be complaints. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, right? You're the guy that you're the guy right now that's making the best show out there. And there's going to be people complaining that it, you know, I, you,
SPEAKER_03: There's been mention of, oh, just having, you know, certain big stars pulling and then, you know, selling more people being more interested in. But guess what? WL did that. They rotated a lot of guys, same guys over and over. And there was people complaining that there wasn't other guys coming in. They're always going to complain. They're always going to find a way to complain. So why isn't Devin on this card? Why isn't, you know, and then people will complain. And then when he's on every card, they're going to say, well, when are we going to see some new faces?
SPEAKER_03: So they're always going to complain. What you're doing is amazing. I think you're in the right direction. And, you know, the adjustments that will be made, you'll make them. And you're doing the whole world, you know, the whole arm wrestling world a huge service in doing this right now. I do my best. But, yeah, the only part I disagree is that when you say, like, you doing it, I disagree. Even you, you show this support.
SPEAKER_02: and encouragement is just making you a part of it because we are doing this all together. The fans are supporting, people like you are being part of it and supporting. You know, the only thing that we need to do is just some of the athletes needs to realize that just being the best in the world sometimes in today's professional sports may not be enough. You really need to promote yourself.
SPEAKER_02: you really need to make like create a fan base understand so that that is how i only give you the stage i do promotion like crazy i am all day on social media everywhere promoted but atlas needs to create their own fan base so when they are pulling their fan base will say okay we are here for this guy you understand but it is some of them they are still trying to get to know that
SPEAKER_02: they need to also promote, promote so that this token can go in it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. And there's characters, there's characters involved too. But the, the, the thing is everybody can't just get up there and shake hands, be best friends and, and, and arm wrestle and then walk away. It, it, it, there's not, there's no substance to that. You know, Devin creates a lot of drama and there's a hundred guys out there. There's thousands of guys out there that want to see him lose, but then there's thousands that want to see him win. It's like Floyd Mayweather. People were buying all his pay-per-views because they wanted to see him lose and he never did.
SPEAKER_03: know you got you you you know ray's got some buddies and some followers that might not like what i'm saying right now but i i guarantee they're they're over there hyped up ready to see me get my ass well you know they wanted they they're ready to see me lose and um that's but that's just this part of it you know yeah yeah yeah yeah so i i
SPEAKER_02: wants to see the character of the person. I'm not saying fake. Whatever you have in you, just express it. They want to get to know the person. They want to know who is Douglas, who is David Camuscia, who is Ali Can. But if they see them only at the table for 20 minutes, that is not enough. They want to get to know the guy's personality, how he takes everything, how he trains, what he thinks.
SPEAKER_02: what are his feelings, thoughts, you understand? So if you create your own fan base, people will start following you. Otherwise, they will just come watch 20 minutes and they will just, okay, say it was a great puller, yeah, but that's all. It doesn't make people addicted, you understand, to yourself. Like look at Devon. Devon is caring. I'm not saying everyone can be like Devon, but everyone can do their own best and people doesn't have to be like Devon.
SPEAKER_03: I'll be speaking your mind. I feel like there's so many. It's the it's the kind of fake humbleness, though, that I mentioned earlier in the in the episode that like the people want to portray that they're this respectful, you know, humble sportsman. When in reality, if they spoke how they really feel, they they really felt it would be a lot more polarizing. You know, be honest.
SPEAKER_03: you think you're gonna kill this dude tell him you know tell him you're gonna kill him you know when you get on the table you obviously don't do anything but arm wrestle like you don't disrespect them um but this this sitting down everyone has their own ways you know i mean right some people are thinking that they don't want to be treated that way and they don't treat that way that part i understand
SPEAKER_02: But even this, they can express. I mean, they can make their own social media. Right, right. That's what I'm saying. I look at the life in this way. And this is the way that I see the competition. And this is my view, point of view, you know. And then people who shares the same feelings, same thoughts with him can follow him as well. They need to know something.
SPEAKER_03: who this guy is other than just i'm not saying everybody has to talk trash what i'm saying is just be honest just be honest yeah but yeah it's it's gonna it's exciting there's a lot of exciting matches on the start yeah anyways my friend tell tell your kids uh my family say hello to all of them and then hope to see you next week my friends
SPEAKER_02: my son even knows who you are now so yeah yeah he likes to look through my news feed and stuff you know what i will do those cards the trading cards one package 34 of them we will have very nice wooden box and then i will present gift to each athlete
