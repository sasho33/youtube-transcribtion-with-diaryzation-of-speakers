SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yeah, but people doesn't understand the shoulder position in winning and losing position. They are like, Oh, your shoulder is below you. They don't understand it by the advantage in the like, not losing and then winning position. Here you are, your arms still can be open here. But here, it cannot open anymore. But some people just knew. But when they when you are new, it's okay, there is no problem. Okay, Devon is here. Hello, Devon.

SPEAKER_01: I'm in range right now to hit the 105 any time, any day. You want me to hit the 105, fucking smash that class. I try to tell people that I bet that you are not losing any muscle at all. The only thing you are losing is just like your body fat percentages, I think, going down.
SPEAKER_02: i think that there's a good chance that a lot of the weight that i'm losing is actually in in brain cells brain cells yeah probably most of it yeah why would it be well just you know when you get older you just get a little bit dumber and you know you start to lose brain cells oh oh good babkin's here too

SPEAKER_03: weight and now he's 115 kilos what do you what do you think about this what do you think about the fact that devon is constantly losing weight and now he weighs 115 kilograms well it's even like this honestly i think he's just probably afraid and and just the toilet disappears the main thing is that the weight hasn't disappeared
SPEAKER_00: he's saying that he probably scared and that's why he's losing so much weight and he's slowly disappearing just make sure you're not disappearing completely you're melting like a snow that's okay all the more glory to the smaller man who crushes the big giant right
SPEAKER_00: He says that when a small person defeats a giant, that's the glory. I agree, I agree. Of course, I'm joking. I understand what he's counting on. So everything is fine, everything is good. I have to be ready for it. Denis says that he's joking and he understands what you're doing and what's the plan. And he said, I will be ready for that.
SPEAKER_02: joking i didn't make any jokes no no no he said he's making jokes about that you disappear making jokes oh yeah yeah yeah yeah he never answered how his family was dennis never answered about how his family was doing
SPEAKER_01: uh yeah he said that all the relatives and mother and father and sister everybody is good everything is fine that's good that's good and and dennis you said you said that you know what devon is doing by losing weight and you are prepared for it can you share with us what you think that he is doing
SPEAKER_00: Denis, he asks, you say that you know why Lorat is losing weight, and you can share your thoughts with us. Without a goodbye. I'm out. Sorry. It will be drier, more durable. That's what he's aiming for.
SPEAKER_02: he thinks that uh devon is losing weight to uh have even more uh endurance yeah this is what i was thinking but i just wanted to hear from him is that true devon i i all i do is sit on the couch and dream about destroying dennis i don't even need to train endurance not training endurance
SPEAKER_02: I go downtown and I arm wrestle with like cooks and roofers and teachers and non-athletes, you know, but people with a lot of soul and this is how I get strong.
SPEAKER_00: How do you want me to translate all of this? You are asking me. My training partners are way cooler than Alera. Yes, he says, I go to the center of the city, I fight with people who make roofs, with teachers, with electricians, but these people have souls, and that's how I become stronger.
SPEAKER_00: Guys saw you training your endurance under coach by the meditations. That's right.
SPEAKER_02: On the bed, on the bed. Knockles up, knuckles up, knuckles up. Instagram actually removed that video. Instagram took it down. Only after I lost like two thousand followers.
SPEAKER_02: hey but you know like we can talk about all sorts of things we can talk about the match and but i'm so curious these days i'm thinking about all sorts of things and and about what what you need in life you know and i was wondering if i was just wondering how much does dennis need like how much does he
SPEAKER_02: i don't want to use the word love i would rather use the word need bad kid i will translate without problems if you know uh
SPEAKER_04: You haven't enough, you know, words to talk with me when I talk to you. I'm just curious how much, I'm just curious what Denis thinks, how much he needs you. He needs, like friend,
SPEAKER_04: like normal people oh i wasn't saying anything else oh you guys are friends okay i didn't know why you all time negative you want to change everyone what's happening what are you talking about don't i'm not asking you about how much you care for each other enough it's not your business oh it's a secret no but this is
SPEAKER_04: in our relation, not depending from you. I didn't know you guys had a relationship. I'm sorry, I just wondered, like, I mean, he seems like he's helping a lot with the film. I have relations with you too, if you remember, if you forget, normal relations. But you trying, you know, mix everything. You sometimes using yourself. Did you ask me yet, or did he, does Dennis know what you're saying?
SPEAKER_00: you can uh because everybody have to know and uh paulo if possible to translate this yeah paul can you translate what does dennis think about bobcat this is what devon is asking yeah that's all i was asking about you didn't need to take it all crazy like denis uh devon
SPEAKER_03: Well, he appeared in my life together with my coach, Kater Azmadze. At first he came, trained, and then we went to Poland very well.
SPEAKER_03: armfight with Devon. Well, to be honest, Babkin treated me like a good friend, a great friend. I always try to be with such people, to be close, to be friends, to communicate. With such people, as they say, well, as they say, to cover the rear, right? That is, you can trust him. And I don't
SPEAKER_03: I feel sorry for the fact that he is close. Even in the case of arm fights, when they started to appear, he did a lot for me in the field of armwrestling, in the continuation of all this. Because he supported me a lot when I had an operation. One of the few. He was close.
SPEAKER_03: I kept the doctors on guard. All the doctors there were afraid that something would go wrong. But somehow he proved himself super right, super good. I appreciate this in people and he is an integral part of my life. He helped me a lot, helps me and will help me, I'm sure.
SPEAKER_00: The answer was that Babkin showed up in my life before the Supermatch with you in Poland.
SPEAKER_00: come up and train together with Dennis's trainer and ever since he was a very good friend he cared about Dennis and he helped him a lot to you know improve his arm wrestling career and when actual surgery happened with
SPEAKER_00: not too many people who showed up and give him a full support. He was controlling the doctors to make sure they are not doing any goofy stuff. And doctors was under the impression that they have to do all the proper things and they are under control and somebody care about it.
SPEAKER_00: and ever since there became very very tight friendship and he's very good uh friend and uh he's a very good human being and then he's trying to surround himself with people like him i think that's beautiful i think that's a beautiful story and uh i congratulate you guys on your partnership because it seems like it's doing very well and uh
SPEAKER_02: you know, in this time of need and connection, I think it's great that you guys are helping each other out so much. I can really see a difference and it looks like you're absolutely glowing right now, so. Yeah, the part that, you know, when he had his surgery and then when Bob Kim was,
SPEAKER_01: uh by him that those are important moments there are there are some important moments in our lives you know and then we really need at that time we find it uh true friends and it's good that uh dennis is a grateful person there are a few super chat his uh family guy thank you for both atlas how are your emotions today compared to 2018 build up peace be with engine and all atlas and guests
SPEAKER_02: How do you feel? What's the difference, Devon, from 2018 till now? I mean, the emotions before the match. Totally different. Totally different. 2018, you know, quite honestly, I felt like I was doing a service as a honorable member of the armwrestling community. I felt like I was bringing the legacy hammer to its rightful owner. That's the way I viewed the match.
SPEAKER_02: I viewed it, you know, I really wanted it to be right hand. It was insisted upon that it be left. So I was like, okay, I'm going to do the right thing. And I'm going to bring this hammer to the guy who's supposed to be carrying it. Now is totally different. Now what this match is, is we can talk about number one, you know, but we all know right now, no matter what the rankings say,
SPEAKER_02: Levon Sagnashvili is number one until he gets beat, even though he's injured. But this is the match to determine who is the next guy to have the shot with Levon. And the truth is, Dennis is incredible. He's an incredible specimen, a testament to sacrifice. And I see the work he's done, but the truth is, is
SPEAKER_02: You know, it's been five years and I never stopped while he had some major, major speed bumps. So this is a different match. This is not the same. I am not the massive underdog like I was last time. This is it's not like that. This is this will be a good fight.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the thing is, the thing is what you said that this is a match to determine who is going to face Levan. Yes, but there is something I think that like to me at least 10 times more important than that, which is a long weighted match with right arm, like more than 10 years. And then like when you were number one in the world and people were saying that, you know, like it's like it should be
SPEAKER_01: denis you know and you never get to meet each other i don't think there has been any match in the history that has been waited like this long and now it's like people are like crazy like like we have been waiting for this and i want to ask the same question to dennis dennis what is the difference
SPEAKER_00: Let me translate a little bit because Denis was sitting and he did not understand what we were talking about. Let me do my job.
SPEAKER_00: Devon said, well, I congratulate you guys. In fact, it is very nice to see that you are close friends and together you manage to do all the tasks that arise much better than if you were alone. And he says, well, all the best. It's very nice to hear that. Then there was a question from our super chat listeners.
SPEAKER_00: How do you emotionally approach the upcoming match compared to the one that happened in 2018?
SPEAKER_00: And Larratt replied, he said, it's a completely different approach. Then, in 2018, I felt like part of it. I wanted it to happen on the right hand, but it happened on the left, which is also good. I understood that I was an underdog, that you were the leader in this match. But I also wanted to start this whole mess with Legacy Hammer, with this hammer that you now own.
SPEAKER_00: incredible, you know, such a word.
SPEAKER_02: holy padlo do you have some kind of a photographic memory or something how do you do that that was like that was like a half an hour talking that's why i'm here though that's incredible
SPEAKER_00: Yes, and he says that you are an incredible athlete, but this time, since you had such spells on the way to this match and everything was not so smooth, he says, I think we are close and it will be a very serious fight.
SPEAKER_00: then he said thank you that was a nice speech uh then uh give me a second hold on you've been talking for 10 minutes it's taking me 30 seconds I'm making the things shorter yeah what do you think babkin is it going to be like that again
SPEAKER_04: Of course, there will be little difference because you grew up, we understand very good about this. We respect your power, your mission, how you grew up. Before this, your name of Contradaction, when you start to be more Contradaction.
SPEAKER_04: Contradiction. What does contradiction mean? I don't even know how to translate it correctly. Contradiction. I'm contradictory? Contradictory, yes. More contradictory. I'm contradictory?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, more now, because before we haven't like this moments, but now sometimes really I don't understand you. Like I'm talking like friend, not like, you know, people who looking around, you know, looking from the other side. I'm feeling in my most sensitive moments and that's why. And of course, I believe you are really now is very good shape.
SPEAKER_04: and really it will be a good fight in November. If you will continue many, you know, negative things against Denis, I have one recipe, you know, one, we have to do something with you in November.
SPEAKER_02: what what is it what do you what do you want to do punch you no no no you know what i will do knowing about what you want now after how you got all angry about the last question now i don't know what you want anymore babkin
SPEAKER_04: I will explain. Don't keep silence, please. You know the name of... Ritual. You know Ritual?
SPEAKER_04: Ritual, yes. Ritual, yes. Ritual for shaitan or somebody inside you. You know what is this? You know, because inside maybe some person you have or... Oh, there's a demon inside me? And I have to... And we will, you know... Like an exorcism.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, we will make exorcism, you know, this is not magical moment, this is religion. I am Christian and we have some praying for this. Really? And Dennis, with him, he will hold you below pillow, because for running you couldn't run from this situation, and I will pray for you.
SPEAKER_04: And after I hope this shaitan will go out from you. Really. Are you saying you're going to hold my head into a pillow or my hand into a pillow? No, no, no. You know, he's talking about an impact. He's going to bring your hand into a pillow. I was like, you want to hold me into a pillow? Yes, when Dennis will put down your hand.
SPEAKER_04: below your pillow, we fix it, and this time I will pray for you, to go outside of, from you, this shaitan. Devon, Devon, did you understand what he says?
SPEAKER_02: he's talking about pillows and holding me down. Pin pad, pin pad. He's going to bring you the pin pad. Why does he say pillow? It doesn't matter actually because it's the translation from the Russian. Does Babkin train dentists with pillows and holding them down? I'm surprised they wouldn't read me about your English. Are you getting held down into the pillow?
SPEAKER_00: down into the pillow and you need help and we will send help
SPEAKER_04: . . . .
SPEAKER_00: Okay, guys, let me finish my job now. Your conversation is over, and I will interrupt you. Engin, what was that question to Denis from our super chat? How he feels? Yeah, how he feels compared to 2018 match, like build-up, before that match and now? Denis, how do you feel about this whole stage compared to the matches of 2018 and the current ones?
SPEAKER_03: To be honest, I don't care. I'm just trying to... I just know myself. I'm just trying to go in one direction and not pay attention to anything. That's how it is with me. So, sorry if you didn't like my answer.
SPEAKER_00: uh dennis says that uh basically and he starts a little laughing i don't give a he said i have i have my thing to do i have my tunnel and everything outside that tunnel doesn't really bother me so the tunnel is there anybody else in this tunnel with him
SPEAKER_02: he said aren't you there with him aren't you supposed to be helping him out all the time we'll leave him alone like that that's not what a good partner does good partner always together together
SPEAKER_04: Listen. With the pillows. Listen, Devon, you have to think about yourself. Don't think about Dennis, because you have problems. Listen, I'm having a hard time not thinking about the two of you right now, because I feel like I'm learning so many things. No, no, don't. If you ask, I will learn many of the other things. Don't worry. Only just ask me. You think about you have now more problems than Dennis. Believe me.
SPEAKER_04: What problems? Do I have problems? What problems do I have? Because one day you want to be woman. One day you want to... What's your real name? Tonight you are Susie or Madonna or which one your name? Second one. What would you like me to be? Your name. Because I have to know about real your name. What would make you happy? I don't care.
SPEAKER_02: You don't care. You just asked me what my name was and you say you don't care. You have to be happy, first of all. If you will be happy... I'm happy, Babkin. Don't worry about me. I'm a happy guy. But how can I love you better, Babkin? How can I get myself up to Dennis level? I think it's impossible, Dennis. It is. Can you tell me what makes Dennis such a great guy to love?
SPEAKER_04: His kindness, you know, he's human. Because you, I know you are the same, but now I don't know from where it's coming inside something, someone, or she coming, or I don't know what's happened. Who's coming? Or she coming inside. She coming?
SPEAKER_04: she she you're you know from oh yes you're the other person who inside you really i think uh it's big problem i'm worried about you really and you know uh i i support you everywhere i support you and i if you feel um you feel this you know if or not
SPEAKER_02: Well, I feel like I'm in the middle of learning all sorts of things. I feel a lot of things are coming out right now. Yes, it's good. It's very good. You are a sensitive person and I feel it too. I feel it. I'm right there with you, Babkin. I feel it. I just, I want to make sure things go slow, okay? I've been hurt before. From whom you are hurt?
SPEAKER_04: From me. It's my heart. It's my heart. You have to be slow, okay? Dennis, yes, of course. Even with you, he will be very, you know, very slowly, very respectable with you. Don't worry. He will do the best. You will not be hurt so much.
SPEAKER_04: Did you ever worry that Denis might hurt you if he didn't go slow? Because I saw in 2018 how the situation was being. If you remember, we walked together. Really, I want, and Denis wants to be, you know, some... We wanted to somehow smooth things out so that it wouldn't hurt, say, Denis.
SPEAKER_04: In 2018, we tried very hard to make him feel the pain of defeat. We tried to support him in a friendly way.
SPEAKER_00: Back in 2018, when you lost, they were trying to make a closer friendship to make things smoother, that it's not so painful for you to just make a friendship out of it. But as of right now, Babkin thinks that you're not really
SPEAKER_02: really into it and you don't feel that way. Well, I'm not just some guy you can buy and sell, okay? I'm not just this guy that you can, you know. It takes a little bit more to get me on your side and, you know, showing me pillow tricks. It's not just that easy. No, no. Don't worry, my friend. We are without illusion. We're coming. Believe me.
SPEAKER_04: without delusions. We're coming for real war. We respect you and we will show the great matches. Believe me. Did you say that or did Denis say that? Are you guys like able to complete each other's sentences? Listen, if you want, if you're talking with me now and that's why I answer to you. What's the problem? But this is not the Babkin show. I'm just curious
SPEAKER_01: Denis, there is a super chat for you. Denis, will you let Devon win the last round like in 2018?
SPEAKER_00: Denis said that, you know what, as of right now, I don't know. We will see what's going to happen in Turkey. Yeah. And Devon, when you hear this kind of question, does it really make you...
SPEAKER_02: uncomfortable and change the things you know on november 11th even more i'm really just so curious i'm so curious you know because i watched the match with john and it gave me a lot of questions to me i i'd like to know what was dennis doing in the match was was dennis playing
SPEAKER_00: Was Dennis playing the whole time? Did Dennis ever try against John? He says, all this leads me to these thoughts and questions. Your match with John, he says, I have a question for you. And you say, did you play with him all the time? The whole super match or not?
SPEAKER_02: It's that let it be a secret. Oh, that's so disrespectful. To who? To John. I can't believe he would do that to John like that. Did he say that he did such thing?
SPEAKER_02: That's what silence implies. You know that, right? When you don't answer, there's a lot of answer there. If he was actually trying hard and fighting hard, he would have said, no, no, John was very strong and that was a good match. No, instead, he subtly, passively disrespected John. That is Rajan Dwargan. On to Dennis. His current right-hand status with respect.
SPEAKER_01: But we're not going to answer that? I don't know. Dennis, did you mean to disrespect John?
SPEAKER_00: Denis, you say you don't respect Can, because they think... It's not my question, this is Devon's question. Devon thinks that the answer to what you said, I won't comment, that yes, you played with him, because if it was a serious fight and a serious fight, you would immediately say, no, Can was very strong, it was a very serious fight, it was very hard, he's super, super strong.
SPEAKER_00: And since you said that you wouldn't comment, it immediately prompted him to think that it was very easy for you to play with Can all the time, to say that you stopped respecting him.
SPEAKER_03: No, not at all. I'm telling you again, I'm a big fan of John. He's my... I don't know how to explain it. I just think that... Why? Let it be... Intrigue. Yes, let it be intrigue. Let Devon think the way he wants to think. I'm even curious what he thinks. Let him fantasize. Yes. Then that's it. I'll tell you later. Well, not for Devon, but...
SPEAKER_00: uh devon he said that uh you can think whatever you want to think uh and uh dennis said he that he's respect john present very much and he is his uh favorite arm wrestler of all the time and uh he is his kumir basically and uh yeah hey look i'm wearing a shirt yes i get it yes yes everybody respect john but i but i heard clearly you said that you played with them
SPEAKER_00: He did not. He said, I will... He did not say that. He 100% said that. No, he did not. Well, he said it because he didn't say otherwise. I understand every word in Russian. What did he say? As close as possible to the original. And he said that he will not comment it. And maybe he will tell the full story of this match later on, but not to you.
SPEAKER_02: yeah but pablo when somebody says that that means that it's true that means that he did because that's our thoughts or our imagination but he did not say that well you know a perception that's your conclusion in reality you know like if i perceive it to be true then it's true and i think that he's disrespecting i think dennis is actually quite disrespectful
SPEAKER_02: i know that you know babkin thinks he's the greatest guy in the world and you know i don't know what they do but um i don't know that he's as nice as you think he is badkin you might be getting your heart broken in a couple years do you think he he also meant disrespect to you when you just you know in the yeah of course
SPEAKER_02: And then he's also disrespectful. No, no, no. I'm talking about 2018. When the seventh round, you know, extra round, he also meant disrespect to your team? No. 2018 was totally different. No, no. In the last round, I'm saying last round. I know what you're talking about. A beautiful display of sportsmanship. A beautiful display of sportsmanship. So much has changed. And I know what it is.
SPEAKER_02: and it's the guy on the it's the guy on your left hand side you talk about an exorcism you talk about an exorcism dennis you need an exorcism but it's not it's not with you hey dennis is it worth it is it worth it dennis is it worth it translate that badkin
SPEAKER_02: say say dennis am i worth it listen even english people didn't understand your english just say dennis is it worth it am i worth it about what like that paulo what did you understand that paulo i'm sorry is it worth what yeah you know what this means
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, money, money, yeah. But is it worth for what? Can you do more? Just look deep in the eyes when you ask the question. Am I worth it? Am I worth it? Yes, you maybe make song about this. It will be good. Like rap. Maybe, but I'm probably busy. You will find some new job, maybe.
SPEAKER_04: New job, yeah. Or kindergarten. I'll probably need one. I'll probably need a new job, too. Make this song. Not serious, Devon. Really, it's not serious. No fear. You're like a teenager, you know? You're doing like a teenager. You know, teenager? What does it mean? Yeah, I have a couple of them at home. I got a few of them here. Yeah. Yeah, good. Very good. Tell me...
SPEAKER_00: Be a good example for your sons. Really? That's going to be hard. Hey, do you guys watch Sesame Street? Do you guys have Sesame Street in Armenia and Russia? What is it, Devin? Is it serious or what?
SPEAKER_01: Sesame Street? Children program. You ever watch Sesame Street, Pablo? Oh, I don't know what it is. Oh, it's very famous. Sesame Street. I don't watch TV. Yeah. Let me ask you a question. One second. To Dennis, your current right arm compared to your 2018 shape or your prime, how is it?
SPEAKER_00: Denis? Question to Denis? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're asking, you know, his shape right now compared to his prime. Denis, right hand. They're asking from the chat, guys. Right hand. The condition of the right hand now, on this day, compared to your best condition.
SPEAKER_03: With the best or after John? With the best. No, in general, in general, if you take a fight with John, then there is already a pro-race. Everything is fine, nothing hurts, everything is fine. Let's move on.
SPEAKER_03: And with your best condition, do you catch up? Well, here, damn, you know, comparing by weight is less. That is, all the same, a number of exercises that I did, I can't do now, I can't compare. Because I can't do some basic things, heavy things. That is, at the table, well, something approached my own.
SPEAKER_00: So compared to the super match with Gian, it's better. How much better?
SPEAKER_00: better he said better okay better compared to the jump super match uh he said compared to the best form ever he said it's a little bit hard to make a comparison because his training changed and he's not lifting uh for the base as heavy as he used to lift so he did not those uh bases but he said on a table i'm getting there it's under still but he said that it's getting closer
SPEAKER_01: and then when there is a question like what do you think about the weight difference is it gonna do any any effect no no not not too much i don't think i mean i'm not really worried about the weight um no no the weight's not going to make a difference when i have a question for you
SPEAKER_01: you know the Dennis that we knew like he was holding low and he had like this kind of movement you know he still was able to do this but now it seems like he doesn't have that cup and the side pressure anymore but he is all with the thumb you know and then rowing you know with lats like stylistically stylistically which Dennis was
SPEAKER_02: more dangerous for you right now like like his his old style the holding and going side pressure or the dentist in my opinion he's better now like he arm wrestles better now i think his training is more dialed in now uh he has babkin as a mentor so babkin's helping him so this is a big change um definitely worth it uh
SPEAKER_02: i mean that's probably the biggest difference so i mean i definitely respect i'm talking about for your style well yeah yeah no no he's better now he's more better for you better for you yeah he's better better he's a better arm wrestler now than he was no i'm not talking about that which dennis would be stylistically more dangerous for you because the other one would be i think i do think he's better now i do i think i think that he's embraced this
SPEAKER_02: instead of like look at when you look back at dennis's matches i mean he would open a certain way however if he got in trouble he would he always had this you know open style of top roll
SPEAKER_02: But he used it more as a secondary. And now it seems like there's more of a primary. But you never know because look at what we see in practice. This is Dennis holding people. And it's like you can't say that this is how Dennis is arm wrestling when his back's up against the wall. And, you know, it's all on the line. We haven't seen a lot of that. We have we don't know exactly.
SPEAKER_02: I believe that Dennis has capability to arm wrestle with his shoulder in an open top. And once a match is stopped, he has an ability to transition through the full spectrum. So look, I think Dennis is a great arm wrestler. It's just not enough. I'm going to beat him. I'm going to beat him.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. I am. I am. Okay, go ahead. Denis, so Engel asked Larratt, does he think you were more dangerous for him before, in terms of style, or now? Larratt says, I think Denis is much better at fighting now.
SPEAKER_00: And he says, I think he's a more dangerous opponent for me now than he was before. He says, well, I've changed. And he says that Denis is an amazing armwrestler. He can fight like with an open hand in such a Paul Kings movie, so to speak, in the middle of the table. He says, he can go from stage to stage if necessary in the process of the fight. He says, we don't know, because we see his sparring training. He holds people and says, we don't know what.
SPEAKER_00: he is really capable, he says, we'll see, but he says, but it won't help anyway, I'll still win.
SPEAKER_01: This trading card is Dennis's. Dennis, right now your rates are not super high because we saw you against John.
SPEAKER_01: This match will change the things in either positive way. I don't think it's going to be negative way. But the Devon stats are naturally higher. Guys, if you want to purchase, yeah, this one. Yeah. Also, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Denis, he compares your two cards and Larratt's, and says, well, you have your indicators, those that are on the card, they are a little lower, it turns out, after the match with John, he says, but it doesn't say anything, and apparently after this match they will improve. Tell me, yes, tell me, on Devon's card, they did it right, they said, this is the eyes after the match.
SPEAKER_00: And Babkin says that on your card, your eyes look like you were shocked after the Supermatch with Denis, and your eyes were shocked by his power and strength. It's always so touching that you notice my eyes, Babkin. Thank you so much. I'm truly happy the way you look at me.
SPEAKER_02: yeah but i don't forget put your hair hey and listen another thing we haven't touched on this yet i'm not opposed i'm not opposed to going in the back room afterwards and sorting it out left hand i'm not opposed to that
SPEAKER_04: go somewhere in the back room, well, that is, somewhere far from the eye, and figure out what to do with the left hand. Yes, the only thing is that Denis needs to figure out with the left hand. His pain will end. We told him, I already wrote to him, that when he sets his left hand, he has a problem on his shoulder.
SPEAKER_03: You need to take pictures, you need to learn what the real problem is. Sometimes he holds someone there, the light guys, but they don't give him a load. I just pump it up, check it. The crunch, in short, is very, you know, a bad crunch in the shoulder. You need to check it. Just after the fight, I want to go and check my leg and shoulder, to see what's going on there and try to do it.
SPEAKER_00: okay Devon as uh as Bob can uh and then he says for you before they have no problem with uh uh pulling you left-handed but uh then he's currently have some problems with his shoulder and in his leg right hand he will take care of those things he will start training left as as as soon as it became healthy and he can pull it they will accept your challenge for the left hand
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we'll sit much. Don't worry. I'm not the guy. I'm not the guy. I'm not the guy who you need to set a match with. I'm merely like a drifter that can probably beat you sometime. You are like a kid, you know? Yeah, I'm like a kid. You don't need to set a match with a kid. I'm not... No, no, no. He said cat, cat, not kid. Cat. No, I'm like
SPEAKER_02: the string, not the cat. I'm the string, Babkin. But you told me one day I want, one day I don't want. Like belly dancer. Like belly dancer? Babkin, I'm not a belly dancer, dude. Get that stuff out of your head. There's boundaries, Babkin. When you're in a relationship, you shouldn't be flirting with other men, okay?
SPEAKER_02: You should keep your language so that you're not leading other men on, okay? Listen, you understand? I'm a ballet dancer and talking about my eyes. You have him right next to you. He's right next to you. I can, I can by hand. It's not good behavior. Okay, Karl Granat. I know you will win Devon. Every veteran leaving or past it will be on your side.
SPEAKER_01: says thank you for your super chat another one has any of devon's children inherited his endurance who is the current top five left-handed according to devon up up he wanted verna thank you like your your children has the i mean i i felt i felt aaron he he's also like you need to really you know endurance
SPEAKER_02: is not my gift it's not obsession is my gift and obsession is the thing that is causing your endurance because you never give up right okay i understand right now top top left-handers not that i'm really paying close attention but in my opinion it's fatali and levon
SPEAKER_02: and i don't know is dennis in there is morzoff still healthy yep he's coming back and and then it's like um you know the fifth spot gets very very open to any number of people whether it's alazan or you think could they show maybe in the conversation oh 100 100 yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: Wow, that's great, yeah. I will ask something to Denis. Denis, but just honestly, did this match become more than a sport competition and personal right now?
SPEAKER_03: Look, I'm going back to Shor and the horses. I'm going, I'm not paying attention. And I'll say it like this. I haven't watched any of Lara's videos. Fortunately. For me, yes. I'm getting ready for the competition, as always.
SPEAKER_00: I already mentioned that horse was you know in a tunnel in her own tunnel and he said no this is a still just a sporting competition and he said I don't really pay attention to whatever videos are out there or has been sent by Devon or by
SPEAKER_01: yeah but he said that he doesn't pay attention anything and then he's the one that showed me that the clown thing you know and and by the way people think that like it has anything to do with me but he also clarified that i had nothing to do with it you know so contradiction full of contradiction
SPEAKER_01: no no i mean i don't mean that i don't mean that like like dennis is great guy but i kind of feel some level of
SPEAKER_03: personal you know about this great guy but great guy but you say you don't watch anything but you still showed a little bit no let's do it like this they are all provocateurs honestly honestly you basically drag me here you think i want to mess up you ask of course for the respect of kengen i'll talk
SPEAKER_03: And what is happening now is also straining me, to be honest. I don't want to see it at all. And so when it came to clowns, it was in Turkey. When they show you everything like this, in the face. Well, of course, I react somehow, I joke, I laugh, I talk. But here, I don't do that. I'm alone and there's no one else.
SPEAKER_00: you know what yeah it's uh it was a clown that's happened uh in turk and uh you know what when somebody is showing your phone to you like this you know look at this look at this he said yeah for sure i have some reactions to this but in the normal circumstances when i'm in my
SPEAKER_00: uh habitat uh back home i don't do this and uh he said yes you know what all this conversation is not really uh pleasurable for me too i'm here because of uh huge respect to engine you guys asked me to have a podcast i'm here i'm respecting you know this is needed but all of this is not really pleasurable for me oh okay okay and can you ask him what does he like to talk about
SPEAKER_00: Denis, is there something you like to talk about? Denis, one second. What did he expect a podcast with Devon to go? And how did you see, how did you imagine that this podcast, this conversation with Lorat would take place?
SPEAKER_03: Again, I kind of don't understand. Look, he speaks English. I don't really know English. That is, already, like, half-baked. You translate correctly, beautifully, in the right place. Everything is fine. In fact, well, I...
SPEAKER_03: Well, I don't react badly. I mean, I'm just like that. I'm in the mood to react to everything well. That's all. I don't think something bad is happening. It's just that Lara works in her own format. She does everything as always. She creates a show. That's how I feel about it. I mean, I don't try to...
SPEAKER_03: I don't need it, I don't want it. I don't see myself in this, in this, as they say, in this, as they say, in this mess.
SPEAKER_00: uh Dennis said that uh he did not expect anything other than this and he said you know what it's not upsetting me uh Devon doing his thing he's creating the show he's creating the hype uh he said that that's all cool with me he said I don't do this stuff I don't see myself into making this uh you know hyper and conversation I'm answering questions that's it we're talking
SPEAKER_02: I understand. I feel like I learned a lot today. Even though this conversation might be painful and difficult, most painful and difficult conversations lead to a greater understanding of yourself and the people around you. I feel like I've learned a lot about Dennis, about Babkin, about relationships and about training and how people help each other.
SPEAKER_02: i i just i'm filled with a sense of uh amazement and uh newfound respect for your openness and and the love you have for each other so cheers
SPEAKER_00: He says, I learned a lot today, I learned a lot about your friendship, and I think I also learned a lot about Denis. He says, the most difficult conversations actually give the most positive knowledge in some field.
SPEAKER_00: Pavel, I hope you're doing a good job translating, not like Babkin. Listen, I'm trying to do my best. I'm not a professional translator. I do know Russian very well, the same as Ukrainian. I speak a little Polish and I speak a little English, and I'm trying.
SPEAKER_01: That's interesting. At the beginning, whenever I was doing polls, you were heavily favored, like 60-40 around. Lately, when I check the social media, people think that like right now,
SPEAKER_01: 53% Dennis and 47 you after 1400 volts. I am I'm curious, is it because you are losing weight and people think you're losing power or because of Dennis's recent videos? We will see Anthony Bowman Devon let Dennis find out how powerful the cosmic punch is on the 11th.
SPEAKER_01: And Engin, hope you feel that building up and let a lot of people watch that amazing event. Thank you for your super chat. Why do you think that people started to, like whenever you were going to pull against Levan, you were like 40% and Levan was like 60%. At the end, you were like 56% and Levan was 44%. And now, I don't know what happened in the last one month.
SPEAKER_02: and then people started to think that dennis is favorites or at least like i think that they probably start to realize that dennis was born when chernobyl blew up and that he was like filled with like cosmic rays and gamma radiation and you know and is dennis even a man or is he something beyond a man like i think that people are starting to recognize that dennis is
SPEAKER_02: he's we don't know what he is but he's not a man he's something else so yes you are right i know like i'm trying to catch up i'm trying to catch up
SPEAKER_00: The good will always win with a bet, you know. Really? Who told him that? Who told you that? Did your mother tell you that?
SPEAKER_04: I didn't ask nothing. Who is good, who is bad in this conversation? Babkin's good. Babkin is good? The rest of us are bad. No, no. If you saw personality Denis and now Devon, of course, Denis is like Saint. Like Saint?
SPEAKER_04: Saint, yeah. Saint. Saint Chernobyl. Yes, if you like like this, no problem. I was closer to Chernobyl than Denis.
SPEAKER_04: You're scared. You're scared, Denis. You're scared. I'm terrified. It's not just scared. I'm completely terrified. My grandfather saved people in Chernobyl when everything happened there. So maybe there's something there. He brought dust from there.
SPEAKER_01: dennis said that his grandpa was uh saving and helping people when this uh catastrophe you know happened he said maybe he brought some dust from here who knows listen devon when when this chino building happened you know like i remember i was like 13 14 12 i don't remember but this was a big trap tragedy and even even many people
SPEAKER_01: around there the countries even my country was affected you know by the by the radiation um does does dennis get hurt and offended when when he hears about this chernobyl thing paulo denis uh
SPEAKER_03: No, of course not. Why be offended? I don't get offended. Why is there such a thing? I don't know either. I'll tell you, the Krivoi Rok is even worse than Chudnoby. You can check out what we have there in Krivoi Rok. Open quarries. I lived right next to the quarry. Yes, there is radiation there too. So what? As it is.
SPEAKER_00: because he said the town where i'm from it's even worse than chernobyl they have open minding and the radiation is through the roof always and you know do you remember like how many people died there in chernobyl yeah
SPEAKER_00: Because of that incident? It was in 1986. I believe from direct impact, it was over 20,000 people. It was the next 20 years. It was much, many, many more because of the development. I was 100 miles from Chernobyl. How old were you? You were born then?
SPEAKER_01: I was born in Rovno. It was about 100... No, no, no, no, no, no. The year. How old are you? Were you born then? Six years old. Oh, six years old you were. Yeah, okay, okay, yeah. Six years old. It was April of 26, 1986, if I remember correctly. Jamie the Bastard. Devon, I am going to send you extra copies of The Art of Armresting. You can give one to Dennis when you want to help him to get better. He needs it. Maybe you should send him 10 copies.
SPEAKER_02: okay are there but you got to add pictures that pictures in the book the hunter your guy is this the most meaningful match of devon's career you know the hunter yeah he's the best that guy is the best one of the best promoters in arm wrestling hunster he makes the best arm wrestling art hey hunster saint chernobyl right dude
SPEAKER_02: there's there's some artwork right there saint chernobyl and listen i was getting somewhere with the sesame street thing babkin is actually the count if you listen if you listen closely you can hear the count in his voice so when dennis is doing reps one two three that's babkin if you listen closely
SPEAKER_02: It's all good poster. He's asking you the most meaningful match for you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is a very important match. Big match. Big, big match. Very excited. Everything about this match for me is wonderful. My opponent, the date, the venue, the time of my life, what it's for, how long we've waited. Big match. Big, big match.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, there is Weld Mishref. Bobcan should understand that athletes barrier and during a fight isn't the same different after the fight. Question for Dennis, any future match? Any future match one second. For with Vitaly for the hammer, all the best guy and keep it up. Thank you, my friend. Do you plan any left arm match with Vitaly?
SPEAKER_00: Or are you planning a match with Vitaly Lalitin in the near future? Maybe you will give him the hammer or will you leave it to yourself? Is it about the left? About the left. No, let's fight back, and then we'll think and decide. I would like to appear after all.
SPEAKER_03: Well, until the New Year at the doctor, who will look at the shoulder. I need his conclusion, to understand already specifically what to do next. If you can somehow cure it all with medicines and some devices, then we'll fight, we'll see. And so, if something happens, of course I'll give it away. I didn't get into it with all my hands. Once we have such a format, as they say,
SPEAKER_03: foreign foreign foreign
SPEAKER_00: um dennis said that uh uh let's let's let's finish with this super match we have right now and he said i hope before the new year i will have uh i will see the doctors and i will have on all the answers i need if there is a possibility that my shoulder is will be fixed with some you know medications or stuff like that i will be back on the table soon if it's not yeah
SPEAKER_00: not actually if it's not possible to fix it you know with some uh minor intrusions but then uh he said no problem i will give the legacy hammer uh to somebody he did not specify to who but uh give it give it away if that's the protocol he said no problem i'm not holding that or hiding that but yeah did you know that dr mark is coming here i heard that
SPEAKER_01: Right. Vita salad, so good. Yeah. Rob is a gift. Rob is like God sent, you know, for this community. Rob is a great guy. He's supporting everyone and he
SPEAKER_01: I and him, sometimes we talk like the other day, we talked like four hours. And on the phone, really, I never in my entire life talk, but we just talked about everything about life, you know. And then I told him about Dennis's left shoulder. And he said, yep, it is for Dr. Mark to come, you know, it's time. And then he will also support, you know, me for the elbow and everything. But it is also saying to you, Devin, that you are the one.
SPEAKER_01: no no no come on come on come on come on there is a chain there is a chain you know we cannot deny no no no let me let me translate this to dennis that's maybe no there is no already oh okay okay there is no already bob can told the rob wrote me a message both in russian and english i also forwarded them pasha
SPEAKER_01: Dear Engin, please remove Babken forever. Cheers for Devon and Dennis, great champions. My friend, Babken is my friend. I'm not removing anyone. Babken is my friend. Dennis is my friend. Devon is my friend. Paolo is my friend. We are not doing that. We can just go back and forth, but we all are the reality. And I call that maybe they wouldn't accept, but for me, we are all friends.
SPEAKER_01: servants of the sport not the anyone but we are serving maybe i should say in different way my english is no good but in many ways you know uh you may like bob kent you may not like bob kent but just remember dennis wouldn't put any videos on uh social media you know if bob kent wasn't doing that for him and i think it is adding a big color you know because i don't think dennis would ever uh promote himself he's not that type of guy
SPEAKER_01: And from other side, Devon is the guy that is just the best promoter, best ambassador of our sport. It is good. We may not like each other or something, but we will all exist. Yes, and we are not human to like or not like, my friend. I think this is important for a Russian-speaking auditorium. Let me translate this real quick. Denis.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, someone asked Engin, he says, can you please remove Babken, and say hello to Denis and Devon, and good athletes. And Engin replied, he says, listen, we are all friends here, and Larratt, and Denis, and Babken, and Pavel, these are all my friends. He says, I will not remove anyone. He says, yes, if we have any questions and disputes, then we are here for this. Babken does a lot of work.
SPEAKER_00: by promoting you, by entering all social networks, and so on, and so on. And he is my friend, a very important person, so no one takes anyone anywhere.
SPEAKER_03: I even think why this message had to be announced at all, to be honest. In fact, if it weren't for Babkin, I probably wouldn't be talking to you here right now, because he provides all this, he negotiates with me, he translates, negotiates with me in English, if it weren't for him and Arfa, there would be no Slar.
SPEAKER_03: Some nonsense people carry sometimes. I just don't know why to raise this message from the phone. I think he has to. I won't ask again. When they send a superchat, they send 5 or 10 dollars, and he tells them to read it aloud. I got it. Well, in short, explain what Babchin is. In the history of East-West,
SPEAKER_00: And the King of the Table is a very important person for me. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here. Denis responded, yeah, Babkian is a very important person in the whole East vs West, King of the Table, my history. He said, if not Babkian, I would not be here with you guys. Babkian is promoting me, he's making all the conversation, he speaks English, he translates, he's promoting me in all the ways, you know.
SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't be even here if he is not here. No, I mean, we would still invite him for sure, you know, we would still invite him. But with Babken, of course, he is just being more understood by the community. I don't know why Devon is laughing. Every time it's about Babken and Denis, Devon is just like there. Why do you think Devon is laughing, Babken? He have complex, you know, I think he have some...
SPEAKER_04: It's very important to tell the truth, Babkin. What do I think? On the line, you are tiger, you know, but offline, it's not like this. No, in real life, I'm very soft. Yeah, I know, I know. Ali Riza, I'm glad to see some left in the mix. Great watch after all five of you held
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what that means, but ask Denis for his chances. Zero, 50, 100. What's your chance, Denis? Denis, how do you assess your chances in percentage? Honestly, I'm in the mood. I think I'll add more. We still have three weeks. And because I've added more,
SPEAKER_03: I understand that I have a good chance. So I'm in the mood to win in combat.
SPEAKER_00: okay this they said if to be honest uh I think the uh I have a good chance uh training going well he gaining after the John super match and he said I still have like three weeks of training so I will gain even more and he said yeah my mindset is very good uh and uh yeah mindset is to win and he thinks that his chances are good this was the answer
SPEAKER_00: Can I ask him, that good, does it mean better than Devon's chances? Just say yes or no.
SPEAKER_00: Denis said that he will speak up for himself, and he said that my chances are good, I feel good, and I'm ready, and mindset is there. And he said, I don't know what the chances Larratt has. Ask him, he can speak up for himself. What's your chance, Devin?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I'm going to destroy you, Dennis. I'm going to win. You know, the thing that is going to be so nice for me is I'm going to get to witness a moment from one of my favorite movies ever. It was one of my favorite movies, and it was actually my favorite character in the movie, and I'm going to get to watch it unfold right in front of me.
SPEAKER_02: um the movie was the never-ending story and there was this big rock giant he used to push this thing around and he was so big and so strong he had these great big hands and he was trying to hold on to these little creatures and the nothing came and took everything away from him and he's looking there and he's looking at his hands and he's and he's not understanding how he's actually weak in the face of the nothing
SPEAKER_02: And I feel like I'm going to get to see that in Dennis's eyes when he faces me and he's not going to understand what happened over the course of five years, because five years ago I was a child to Dennis and five years later, I believe it will be very different.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know how Pablo is going to translate it. I can translate this. Can I tell Devon something? Not as a translator. Devon, for mercy, I will win your left hand because you win. I have to translate this. Pablo, I will break you into a million pieces and I won't even train. I won't even train. You don't even need to translate that. Anytime, anywhere, you show up in my house and I'm going to rip your wrist off.

SPEAKER_04: All the best to you in November. That's like a passive aggressive. Are you calling me stupid, Babkin? Stupid things. You can do stupid things. So you're calling me stupid? No, no. He says stay away from those things. What does that mean? That means he's calling me stupid again. If you want to understand like this, I will explain you when I will see you face to face. Not online. I don't want to see you. You stay away from me.
SPEAKER_04: And you run, of course, you all the time. You stay away from me. You and Dennis Vogel. When we are talking seriously, of course, you all the time running from me. I know this is not new.

SPEAKER_04: And Babken, you were serious about taking the demons away from Devon and save him? I hope, yes. We will do it. Yes, we will do this. We will pray. My friend, I know some Christians praying will not help. You can, you know, Muslims do the same. You can pray too.
SPEAKER_04: You can help me. If it's possible, we have to. Are you sure that Devon has demons? Are you sure?
SPEAKER_01: I think yes, because how he changed. Three demons. Look, look at him. Anyway, Devon, you just go to your practice and then less than probably three weeks. No, about three weeks, a little bit more than three weeks. Get bigger, Dennis. Get bigger. You need to get bigger, Dennis. Hello, Judy.
