SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah of course of course and training like last time when when you talk i told you that's i will try to don't join too much too much weights because you asked me if i can lose 110 so like 150 right sorry either either 115 or 105 but probably 115. no no you you told me about the opponent like that guy from usa uh yeah he there is the categories 105 and 115 i think he can go
SPEAKER_00: 105, yeah. What's your weight right now? Like now I am 112, 130 maximum. Yeah, yeah. Because like...
SPEAKER_00: I told you that this guy, when we talk about this guy, he told me that maybe I can cut from 110 or maybe to be better for 105. And I told you and this guy that same thing that I will try, but I don't know. But now I don't try too hard to like don't change. Normally I feel good.
SPEAKER_00: you need to know the match right the date and everything just so that you can yeah yeah yeah yeah like the about the weights we can we can talk there's no problem for me now but like for 105 you know for me to lose 105 like the that is to change my weights or if there will be someone in 115 maybe this guy or like 110 i can
SPEAKER_03: I understand. Change the weight class. I must think about it. The other day, Gennady wrote me. Gennady wished me the best because of my health problem. And then I talked. He said he is now starting to train. And I think Reva is also starting to train because he had a broken finger. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and
SPEAKER_00: And Levan is going to start where he should probably, in what, two weeks or something? Yeah, all of Georgian athletes will start. The Georgians are coming back. Yeah. Let's wait. Let's wait. Yeah, it will be great, yeah. Like, there is a surprise, no? From Georgian, there is three super heavyweight athletes and all of them have been injured. One time. What's that?
SPEAKER_00: like from georgia that is three top super heavyweights athletes this is revas gennady and levan and 40 times all of these athletes have the injuries oh yeah yeah and these are easily they were like
SPEAKER_03: top five top six you know yeah yeah same time you know yeah yeah yeah if you will cut these three athletes this means that uh like top athletes top 10 athletes least will be difference you know yeah i i think in top top 10 you know uh we have two kazakhs morozov and uh yeah and okay someone came
SPEAKER_03: Who is that? Oh, it's Irakli. Hello, Irakli. Classic Georgian podcast style, you know, from the car. Yeah. We cannot hear you. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And hello, Rustam. Legend. One of the most successful arm masters in history with 20 world titles, WAP titles. He was like a machine every day, every year. I'm sorry, you know, this is coming. Hello, hello, Engin.
SPEAKER_03: Hello, Irakli. We hear you now. Yeah. How are you? Rustam, you hear us? What? No. No, I was talking to Rustam, you know, if he hears us. I hear you. Oh, you hear me? Okay. Rustam, can you turn the phone sideways? You too, also, Irakli, if you can. Rustam, how long have you been in England? How many years?
SPEAKER_03: How long have I been living in England? Yeah. One year. One year. One year. Yeah. So you're learning English slowly. Slowly, slowly. That's good. That's good. Hello, Vasily. Good to see you. Hello, Mr. Engin. Pleasure for me as well. Pleasure for me as well. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Yeah, it's great. Yeah. We have a great...
SPEAKER_03: matchup for the East vs West 10. Irakli Zrakashvili and Rustam Baber. Irakli is our rising star and one of the best pullers in light heavyweight and
SPEAKER_03: Exactly. Every time you come to the East versus West, you compete one of five kilo category, but you are always like 99 kilo, 100 kilo, you know, never, never really 105. So I think it is the right decision, you know, just like what is four kilo, you know, just go down.
SPEAKER_00: Like what's your weight now? 98? What's your weight? This is a question for all of you. When you were watching this video, we all thought that Sasho was 10kg and Kargi was 15kg. What do you think about that?
SPEAKER_02: Now I weigh 10 kilos, I don't know how much I weigh, I don't know how much I weigh, I don't know how much I weigh, I don't know how much I weigh.
SPEAKER_00: um so you have to say hi to everyone like he is now um 100 kilo but he did not start cutting or something like this normally he feel like normally his weight is now 100 kg
SPEAKER_00: And how does he feel? Feel the same? If he will not try to gain, he always the same, like 100 kg. Yeah, I understand. Hey, he doesn't have so many days, you know, left. Only two weeks, he needs to lose five kilos. Better start.
SPEAKER_00: for him there is one one week is enough for lose the five changes normally lose weights is the more easy for him than the jane like how it's here and in rustam uh you made a comeback against pauline you were winning to
SPEAKER_03: and then Pauline decided to go inside and then you got injured from your chest and people have been asking me how is it now they are asking like how is the chest how is your form so uh
SPEAKER_01: Well, in principle, in training it does not interfere with me, I have already kind of recovered, I feel that it does not interfere much. But according to how it will be at the start, how it will be at the maximum tension, I do not know yet, so I want to see all this at the competition. I will hope that it will not interfere with me, I will hope so.
SPEAKER_01: I was preparing for this, in principle, a little time has passed, but in general, in training, I seem to be experiencing angles, everything seems to be working well. We will try, we will check.
SPEAKER_03: So he thinks that during the training, it doesn't disturb him too much. But how it will be after the start, yes, he's not sure. Because during the start, you might feel the maximum pressure, way more than during the training, yeah? But he would like to check how it will be. But during the training, all of his angles, he feels okay.
SPEAKER_03: Does he think that the risk will be maybe even minimum because this is most likely not going to be a deep hook match? No, whenever I say, just don't get me wrong.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, it may be a deep hook match by Ruslan, but we know that Irakli mainly is not a hook puller, but of course he can also pull in hook, but that's not his main style. Yes, of course, Irakli is not a hooker, but he can also fight in hook.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I will say that the hand is ready, the hand is strong. All the indicators, in general, are maximum. If suddenly there will be more power in the uracle, then I can let go of the hand in that direction. But we will fight, we will check, we will try. That is, there is a competition for this, we will fight.
SPEAKER_03: I will try to do everything to win. He will try to do his best to win. His hand is ready and it's very powerful. But if Irakli's hand is going to be more powerful, then there is no other way for Rustam than to give it. But the thing is, that's why exactly there will be a competition where you can check
SPEAKER_03: your abilities so he's waiting for it i understand i understand and rustam besides the injury your form is better than the last time you came here rustam yes
SPEAKER_03: Yes, his hand became more powerful and his hope that that injury will not disturb him to show it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, I understand. Thank you. Irakli, you are going to compete against someone that, in my opinion, is one of the greatest arm wrestlers of all time.
SPEAKER_03: And he is known to be a top-roll killer because of his hand, wrist, and the side pressure. But from other side, you are... The matches that you lost were against the top-rollers. But whenever you pull against the guys that mainly going inside, like Krasimir and like Lachlan, you were...
SPEAKER_03: So how do you see your chances against Rukhtam? Do you agree that you are doing better against the hook pullers than against the top rollers? That's what I'm saying. You can say that from my point of view, in the history of the club, one of the best clubs in the history of the club.
SPEAKER_00: And we have to understand that there is a combination of advantages and disadvantages. One of which is that there are advantages and disadvantages.
SPEAKER_00: But you can say that if you are able to do something, you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with all your strength and if you are able to do it with
SPEAKER_02: Well, in general, I had a lot of problems with my biceps, but it's not a big deal. I think I will continue to work out, maybe I will continue to work out as a sportsman, but I know that there is a lot of pressure on the biceps. Everyone is interested in it and is very interested in it.
SPEAKER_02: I was interested in the whole thing and Rustam was sitting on my bicep and I was very interested in the game and I was very excited to play with Rustam.
SPEAKER_00: um yeah so so he said that yes this is true like uh with the hookers who is the hooker you have to feel more uh well and comfortable so but um this is the question for him too and he's telling that he is the thankful for you engine because when you when you ask to directly to meet with rustam this was the answer like question because you always to
SPEAKER_00: I think, can Rustam hook him or not? He was thinking that before? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was the question for him. So this much will be answered for his question. But he thinks that guys like they are top hookers who meet already with Irakli. But Rustam is another level. Another level with the hand and wrist and side pressure.
SPEAKER_03: and um and this is the why he heard the questions but if we will take top rollers who cares top rollers and who cares who cares is uh better for yakli so yeah another question for iraqli when iraqli came to watch east versus west two after the match he pulled with uh prudnik and i saw him even in the hook he was very competitive
SPEAKER_03: But after that, we didn't see him, you know, in training or something, not so much. Just in case, just in case he cannot top roll or hang Rustem's wrist on his pronator, is he ready for a hook war as well?
SPEAKER_00: As I said, when I first saw him, I thought that we were going to fight each other. And I thought that if I hit him on the biceps, he wouldn't be comfortable and I wouldn't be able to fight him. And I thought that if I hit him on the biceps, he wouldn't be comfortable and I wouldn't be able to fight him. And I thought that if I hit him on the biceps, he wouldn't be comfortable and I wouldn't be able to fight him.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think? In this case, as a person, there is no special biceps, very strong biceps. Well, I would say that strong biceps are not a problem, there are no injuries. The main thing is that the biceps are strong. I think there is no problem with the biceps. Dimash, tell me how you feel and how you feel about my biceps.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, of course, he thinks that maybe he's not too strong, but in the sparring, two times the sparring or in the trainings, he feels that his hook is not weak, you know? But competition, he didn't need to try to hook someone.
SPEAKER_00: But if someone will hook him, he thinks that his hook is not weaker than others. Is he training hook as well? Yeah, he told that in the preparation times, he can do biceps trainings as well. Do you guys still train together?
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah so you know as well the answer yeah oh yeah he told me already that yeah yeah no no i mean if if you are training with him he you know all of the times all of the times like in my right sense i am more hooker than top roller so i know how he's powerful how his hook is
SPEAKER_03: So, I will tell my opinions that Hisuki is... In your opinion, Davit, in your opinion, is Irakli gonna be as strong as when he pulls 105kg category two weeks later?
SPEAKER_00: yeah in my opinion like uh like last time when we talked with iraqli there was you asked him maybe he will try in 95 and my opinion is the same and he said he told both us that he will one more time trying to try uh in 105 so in my opinions when he's like when we see all of that matches where iraqli beats his opponents he was down in 100.
SPEAKER_00: so why why why not because like there is difference between the levels like 95 kg guys and 105 kg guys so he like he will he will know like how he feel in my opinions his shape will be better like iranian shape will be better in 95 wow and uh the another sports fest i think so the their level will be the like in one in one level you know
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but the big people at the 95 kilo usually smaller guys than the 105 kilo guy. Yes, yes. But while Irakli will be a big guy for 95 kilo, this is... Yeah, yeah. Also, also Irakli can pull two categories. He is 100 kilo.
SPEAKER_03: Sometimes 105, sometimes 95. So another question I want to ask to Rustam, almost the same question in opposite way, you know. Rustam, we know you as a, like with this bottom of your hand and this, especially this lower resendant and this side pressure, you are incredible. I think probably you are best in the history about this kind of way, but we also see you
SPEAKER_03: We also saw you top roll. You are able to do all these three. And do you think that other than your main technique, which is hook, the side pressure and the top roll may be an option in this match? Rustam, everyone knows you as the king of this move.
SPEAKER_03: You also train side pressure, top pressure. What do you think, are all these three options at the same level? Or... I got it. I think it's more or less the same, but in different situations there are certain
SPEAKER_01: The ability to use every movement. There are situations where I can't use, for example, the side movement, I go in more with the help of supination. There is an option where you can't go up, because there is no high efficiency, hands are not enough. If there is an opportunity to win or to fight well,
SPEAKER_03: he's saying that plus minus actually it's equal but in different situation might be different income for example uh
SPEAKER_03: If he cannot do the side pressure, he's trying to do the supination. If he cannot go through top roll, it might be because his hand, it's not enough long, length, yes? So, in different situation, might be different income. But everything is ready? Every option is ready with him? Yes. Yes, he is ready for that. Okay, okay, that's good.
SPEAKER_03: I talked with Pauline Iraklis and you know that you and him were going to pull in next event, right Iraklis? Yes, no problem. But I talked with Paul. Paul said that he would pull you.
SPEAKER_00: only if you beat Rustam. And he said, if Rustam beats you, he's going to pull Rustam. OK. And Rustam, if you beat Irakli,
SPEAKER_03: Are you willing to pull a rematch against Pauline? Rustam, if you win Irakli, will you want to take the challenge and compete with Pauline? With pleasure. With a great pleasure. With a great pleasure. Okay, that's good, that's good. Let's go Irakli versus Pauline. And then, and then, probably,
SPEAKER_03: then the winner will pull the world title match. Because most likely, if John doesn't make 95 kilo and then pulls his 100 kilo, then I think Sasha will still remain the champion if win or not, because it's not a title match. So if then I think the next match, regardless of the result of Tata Sings versus Ongar Bey with 105, it will be Sasha versus Ongar Bey.
SPEAKER_03: Todd Hutchings match and then so okay the winner of this match will pull Pauline and then the winner of that match will probably pull the winner of Todd Hutchings versus Sasho match yeah can you explain uh
SPEAKER_00: Yes, okay. The current situation is very bad. I would like to say that the Consciousness program can be used, and the program that can be used can also be used in real-time in real-time.
SPEAKER_00: If Johnny doesn't make it to the top, he won't be able to make it to the top in 2015, so he won't be able to make it to the top. And we hope that he will be able to make it to the top in 2015.
SPEAKER_00: And in the future, if you want, you can go to Oulinso, and if you want to leave the country, you can go to Sashosa and Totachi. Yes, that's right, that's right. Totachi is in the north of Magden in the 1950s, right?
SPEAKER_00: uh uh oh you actually have one question like todd hutchins is will compete in 95 or and this will be 95 kill against sasha world title match if john brzing doesn't go down if john goes down
SPEAKER_03: and pulls Sasho and then beats Sasho, then it will be Tatasic versus John Brzezinski in 95. But it looks like John probably is not going to make 95 because he's already ripped. I think he's not going to, but he didn't tell me his decision. But this is my opinion. I think he's going to be 100 kilo. So what is going to happen is that Irakli needs to beat first Rustam.
SPEAKER_03: And then Paulin. And then the next match will be world title match. Either Sasho or Tatasins for the world title. Or Rustam needs to beat first directly. And then Paulin. And then Rustam versus Sasho. Rustam versus Tatasins. Rustam, I had a podcast with Tatasins. And he wants to try against you one more time at some point.
SPEAKER_01: Rustam, on a recent podcast, Engin had Todd Hutchings, and he said that he would like to fight you again. One more time. Well, we'll fight, we'll fight with everyone who wants. We just need to prepare for everyone. We will be step by step.
SPEAKER_03: he would like to pull with everyone but like the thing is he needs to prepare to everyone as well so yeah let's do let's do it and let's focus step by step yeah first directly right through some yeah yeah rustam you are what 41 years old 41 41 41 41 yeah
SPEAKER_03: Look at John, 59, still competes. So you have many years. John, legend. Yeah, you are too. You are too. Like John is here. John is here. And then you, Zolev, Gachevski, in my opinion, you know, like these are also many legends there, you know. But John is here.
SPEAKER_03: Rustam, how do you see your chances of winning against Irakli?
SPEAKER_01: I have never fought with Irakli. I can't even say who will be an uncomfortable opponent for each other. I'm going to win. I can't say anything about it yet, because there was an injury and I don't know how the chest muscles will behave where there was an injury. Therefore, I don't even want to talk about it now.
SPEAKER_01: It's hard for me. I just don't want to, so to speak, not fit in.
SPEAKER_03: okay the thing is uh as for now he don't wanna overthink about the possibility how he previous injured my effect on the match but he is going to win he's going to win he's preparing to win the thing is that he never arm wrestle with iraqis so he cannot surely say who is going to be more uncomfortable to who iraqli to rustam or rustam to iraqli and yeah
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, okay, that's the answer. So he's coming there to win, but he doesn't know everything because he never pulled directly before. But he thinks he's going to win, but he will feel it who will be more comfortable once they grip up.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, everything is correct. And Irakli, what is your winning chance against Rustam? I'm going to ask him, what's your winning chance? Is that all? Everything?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what to say, I'm a big sportsman and I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say, I'm a big sportsman and I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_00: uh there we have the same situation he told that he never even grip him so he don't know how it will be he will he will go in eastern in east versus west for win to win but he think now for his opinion there is 50 50 so let's see i understand i understand and there are two superchats three four says rustam will win
SPEAKER_03: He would beat Paul if he was not injured. This is a super check by Trip War. SG Records, Hello Engin, Mukitsva, Chemgan, Kartvel, Lomeps. What did I say? This is to say hi for Georgian Lions. Okay, okay. Okay, Rustem.
SPEAKER_03: Generally, what do you think about the East vs. West X-10? Do you find it a big card, exciting card? Rustam, in short, what do you think about the East vs. West? Do you find the cards cool? Yes, the opponents are well selected, the pairs are well selected. I think it will be interesting.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying his opinion is going to be interesting because the couples combine in a good way. So it's going to be nice to see. Is there any specific match that you know is interesting other than his own match?
SPEAKER_01: I would watch almost most of it. It's interesting to watch Kamila Yablonskaya and Matyushenko. Kamila Yablonskaya and Matyushenko? Interesting for you? For me, yes. I'm a friend of Kamila.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, you are friends with Kamil, yeah? Okay. And how do you see, what do you think about this match? Who is winning? I don't know. Long time, not wrestling with Kamil. Okay. Everyone, yeah. No, no, no. Eight months. Eight months. Okay. I understand, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I understand. Maybe we talk about the predictions and then, yeah, let's start about the predictions of the matches. Let's start with Irakli. What do you think, Irakli, about Kamil versus Ivan Matyshenko?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what to say. Matushchenko. Matushchenko. Matushchenko is going to win? He is a very good player and there is no doubt that he will win. There is no doubt that he will win, he is at his best.
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that Ivan is too smart and he just thinks that Ivan will not give the chance to use the power to time the match. So he says it's too fast, right? Yeah. I understand. And Rustam said he doesn't know, right, about this match. Vasily. Rustam, is it right that you don't know how this match will go or what do you think?
SPEAKER_01: Well, I think Kamil can win. Ivan versus Kamil. Prize, Ivan. This is his opinion. Oh, Ivan's favorite, he says? Who will win? I will root for Kamil. The match will be good. Kamil is my friend.
SPEAKER_03: Considering that Kamil is his real good friends, he will do nothing rather than cheering for him. And he hopes this match is going to be good. And on his opinion, at the end, Kamil can surprise Ivan. Okay, okay, I understand, yeah. And let's talk about Egle versus Sara.
SPEAKER_02: He thinks that both of them are too strong, but he thinks that Sarah will win. And you, Rustam? Rustam, what do you think, Egli or Sarah? Well, I know that Sarah is very strong, so I think that Sarah should win.
SPEAKER_03: Is there a problem with his connection? Yeah, it's very strong. Vasili, you're getting cut. We don't understand anything. We don't hear you. Maybe you tell us. Do you hear me? Now, yes, but often you are getting cut.
SPEAKER_03: No, no. Yeah, maybe it's accidentally. He's saying that he's sure that Sarah is very strong and she's supposed to win. Oh, she's supposed to win. Okay, okay. And then Fia versus Rosa Acosta. Do you know Rosa Acosta directly? Rosa Acosta sits on a bone, which I'm supposed to not understand. No. No. And Rustam, do you know Rosa Acosta? No, no, no.
SPEAKER_03: You don't know. Okay. Okay. So it's hard to predict when you don't know. Rosa took second place in the WAF heavyweight division, while Fia is 70 kilos. Fia was originally set to pull against Gladkaya, but Gladkaya couldn't make it. And she's going to make it, but not this time. So let's go another match. This is an important match, exactly. Artem Taino versus Fasho, left arm.
SPEAKER_03: Exactly. Sasha. Sasha is going to win, you think? Yes. And you, Rustem, how do you see this match? I think Sasha. You think Sasha is going to win? Yes, yes. Okay, okay. And Frank Lamparelli versus Matt Mask. Exactly. Zero.
SPEAKER_03: Lamparelli. Matt Mask. Matt Mask is going to win. And you, Rustam? Lamparelli. Lamparelli will win, you say. And then Matt Mask, Irakli says. Okay, okay. Engin Terzi versus David Samush. No, no, no. It's just canceled. It's an old record. Yeah. That was good. Good form, but...
SPEAKER_03: Anyways, Irakli, do you know Tuzliyev, Abdulmanap Tuzliyev? Do you know him? Yes, yes. Yeah? And Tuzliyev, in fact, more dangerous against the top bowlers because his style is too fast hooking, you know. And his inside hook is also incredible. Do you see Tuzliyev having chance to beat Samusha?
SPEAKER_00: I know you are from Georgia, but what do you think about this match? First of all, I would like to say that BGO is a very strong team. I would like to say that it is a very strong team and they have a very strong style. But how do you think, when you say that Georgia is strong and Samusha is also a Georgian team?
SPEAKER_02: The real question is, what kind of problem can Davitsov solve? Well, I would like to talk about this, because I don't know Davitsov, I don't know Samu, and I would like to talk about it. The first thing I would like to say, Davitsov, is that the first thing I would like to say is that Samu is such a great man, and he is a great man.
SPEAKER_02: You can't do it in the gym because you have to go to the gym and you have to do it in the gym. You can do it in the gym because you have to go to the gym and you have to do it in the gym.
SPEAKER_00: uh yeah like uh you actually said that's uh david and he training together for this uh east versus west so he had sparring times together and uh two days ago they talked about it when david said him that his opponent will be that guy you actually think first time for first things what's here i think that's
SPEAKER_00: uh david's hand is uh so like high higher and uh style is that's that um when they will start the hook position will be more better for david than the his opponent so he said that's this guy have the really strong hook but david's hand is so specific so he think that's there no there is no problem for david so directly you are teaming up with samush against me huh
SPEAKER_00: He was training with a very powerful top roller. Maybe I'm lucky that I didn't have an accident.
SPEAKER_00: I think it will be better for both of them because Dawid's opponent is the same time and Irakli's opponent is the same time.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it was a good hand training for Samusha and good pronator training for Irakli. And Rustam, how do you, do you know Abdulmanap Tuziev, Rustam? No, no, no, don't, don't know. You don't know? No. Okay, okay. Abdulmanap Tuziev is from Kazakhstan and incredibly fast, explosive and very strong hand wrist and
SPEAKER_03: very explosive guy and i think last year he won the waffles and this year he won and the wow finish and they did protested after the event by the camera you know they said that his elbow was out and they gave the winners to win to the uh
SPEAKER_03: so the guy is very good but you know also samusha is um iraqi is there anyone that can beat samusha on this earth under 85 kilo probably uh
SPEAKER_03: He have not idea and this question is in his head. Oh yeah. He cannot think anyone, yeah. Yeah. Exactly. This event, Dr. Mark who did stem cell therapy to Levan is coming to Istanbul and he will do stem cell to me and then Samusha will be
SPEAKER_00: Travel. Problem. The person who brought this message to America is now in Turkey. And he brought it to me. And now he lives in a very big city. No, it's not like that. I don't want to talk about it now. But everyone in the city, no matter where they go,
SPEAKER_02: I don't want to talk about it, but if you're in a relationship, you can have sex.
SPEAKER_00: like here closer that's honest honestly uh if even someone can beat david in his opinion the first place is yours because like when when like everyone we talk with the david that's we always talking about that that's you are a most dangerous guy for for him so because of the style
SPEAKER_00: Coordination? For me, this question is for Irakli. I will ask Irakli about it. No, no, no. This is what Irakli says or you are saying? No, no. I said what Irakli said, but you ask me.
SPEAKER_00: yeah and iraq is thinking that if anybody has chance it's me yeah if anybody is if even he's imagining that someone can beat david this is you and the first place is who you are and he talked about about your and his budgets you are the most dangerous guy for him and and and what is your opinion do you think i have i david uh i david and iraq this is our
SPEAKER_03: our meeting you know we told you all the same way yeah yeah okay okay so let's talk about uh sasha versus john rustam rostam and sasha match is like john is 100 kilo sasha 95 kilo it is not the category match it's like no title match
SPEAKER_03: And what is your opinion if John is 100 kilos and Sasha 95 kilos? And what if, small chance, if John goes down 5 more kilos and 95-95, does it change anything? Rustam, well, look, it's a complex question. The fight about Sasha and John, right? Sasha will perform at 95. John, most likely, at 100. Inge, are you sure John will be able to lose 5 kilos?
SPEAKER_01: Will he be able to show himself with 100 kilos or will he lose 5 kilos and reach 95? You interrupted a bit there. You meant that if he loses 95, will Sasha win? Is that what you meant?
SPEAKER_01: And so, and so, how will he show himself with 100 kilograms, yes, as he is now? And how can he play, is it good for him or not? I think that 100 kilograms will be more comfortable for John. In any case, age can give its own when racing. Well, for Sasha, of course, John will be very unpleasant, very unpleasant. Because he will be very difficult for him. I think that the advantage is on John's side.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that... My friend, your connection is very bad. Okay, let me try. Let me try. Translate like this, yeah. Because...
SPEAKER_03: Yes, can you translate? Now better? I mean right now, yes, but we will see. Yeah, so he's saying that for John it's better to keep the 100 TG because his age and lost weight at such age can be difficult and harmful for his body and for his condition. But anyway,
SPEAKER_03: John is going to be a very tough, hard and uncomfortable competitor for Sasha because of his strong hand and wrist as well. I understand. Okay, and Irakli, how do you see this match? Sasha versus John, who's winning? John. John winning?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the journal will read it. And what's your opinion? I want to say that his battery is low, so he will online on the...
SPEAKER_00: After what? After 10 minutes. His phone battery is down. Because we are finishing already, so he better be quick. Yeah, he said that he will stay online and his phone will turn off. OK.
SPEAKER_00: Ask the same thing, like the difference between 100 kg John and 95 kg John. Like 60% for 40%, he thinks that John will be beat both situations.
SPEAKER_03: even in 95 kilo yeah okay okay and there is a super shed uh iraqli who is winning sasho or samushia in 85 kilo thank you as your records
SPEAKER_03: He has no idea about this. 85 kilos? Yeah, yeah. I asked him, but he has no idea about who will be the winner. And Trip is asking Rustam, who was his toughest opponent during his career?
SPEAKER_01: And then let's go to the other match. Last F.E. match. Zaur Pajzulaev versus
SPEAKER_03: Georgi Svetkov, Irakli. Georgi Svetkov. Georgi Svetkov is going to be... Okay, and you, Rustam? I think Georgi Svetkov. If he will be in good form. Okay, okay. I think he is in good form, yeah. And by the way, Rustam, your right side looks very big, your shoulders, your...
SPEAKER_03: everything you know i said no i don't know i don't know oh yeah show some bicep oh yeah ask exactly if he's intimidated
SPEAKER_00: Size is no matter. He cares about here, right? This is all he needs. Yeah. You actually want to ask him what is his weight? 98, 99. 98.5? 98, 99.
SPEAKER_03: 98, 99? Yes, yes. Wow. You both are a little bit heavy. Okay, let's go Irakli. Ongarboe versus Tatasins. And you are the best person to answer this because you competed against both guys. How do you see this match? I don't want him to tell us this guy wins. I want him to tell us some details.
SPEAKER_00: Now, as you said, there are a lot of people, all of them, who are interested in this topic. But I don't want to talk about it in detail, because I don't want to go into too much detail.
SPEAKER_02: Well, for me, it's an interesting match. It's an interesting match, because there are two players in the team. One of them is a very talented player from Hungary, and I don't want to say that he's a very good player.
SPEAKER_02: and there is no doubt that Goni is a man of his word. I think everyone is interested in this scene.
SPEAKER_00: uh so we actually said that like this is the most uh most like best best match in this event so he's uh he will be happy to see this he think that's uh like both of them the have the specific style so there is 100 that's ongar by will work more and more technically and to try try it all all of the techniques
SPEAKER_00: But I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: And Ongarba will try to not give the chance to Tozila to use his power, but he has not a reason why he thinks like this, but he thinks that Tozila will have more endurance and he will beat like this.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, he will win. So he thinks that Todd is going to win. Yeah, he thinks that... This is an important opinion. I'm not saying I agree with him or not, but important because this guy pulled both of these guys. And also John pulled both Ongar Bayev and Todd Hutchings. And John also thinks that Todd is going to win. And many people think that
SPEAKER_03: Ongarba is heavily favorites, but in my opinion, it is very close match 50-50. But if anyone has good based opinion, it doesn't mean that he is right or wrong, but at least his opinion based on something, you know, his experience, and he thinks that Todd has more chance to win.
SPEAKER_00: what he says right david yeah yeah he says he said that like it will be tough much tough much and it will be like that's ongar by will use all of the techniques all of the like all his power and he will try to don't give the chance to the toji to use his full power but somehow he think that's up there is no matter like endurance will will give the tozilla to beat ongar by
SPEAKER_03: Okay, and Rustam, how do you see this match? I think 50-50. 50-50, yeah. I also think the same way. One is very, very technical. He can do many things. The other one is incredible side pressure. Rustam, do you realize that Paul is a little bit different? In the past, he was, you know, like this. Now, he protects the pronator and he more pressure with the pronator.
SPEAKER_03: And do you agree that to beat Tatashins, you need to control his, you know, pronator and make him like this, like make his palm up?
SPEAKER_03: Rustam, look, for his career, Todd changed the way of fighting. First, he fought like this, and then increased the strength of the side pressure. Do you think the right technique will be chosen to beat Todd like this? I think the technique will be correct. In any case, Todd will lose more strength with each fight.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, in his opinion, it's going to be the right technique because with each round, Todd will lose his power. Plus, he's almost like a double-edged Kedar Galis, so it will make an effect as well. Yeah, but he's still known to be one of the best endurance players.
SPEAKER_01: But even at this age, he is known as one of the most outstanding. I think it will be so, if he breaks his wrist. Qadar Ghali can give side pressure. If he takes the upper position, it will be easier for him to push and the opponent will be able to wear out his hand faster.
SPEAKER_03: If Kudrygaly will be able to set the higher position, it's going to be easier for him to make Todd Hutchings' hand faster, make it tight faster. Let's go to the most expected match in the world.
SPEAKER_00: Irakli, Denis Siklenko versus Devon Larratt. Devon Larratt. That's all you will say? No detail, nothing? For one minute. You can ask the same question to Rustam, and he will back, OK? Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if I can make any predictions, but I'm sure I'll be able to win.
SPEAKER_00: This is like most interesting match for him and he don't give like who will win or something like this, but he think that Stevan has more chances. Okay, I understand. And you Rustam, how do you see this match?
SPEAKER_01: I want to say yes. I think Devon took into account many nuances of the last fight and can also present an additional surprise, prepare the movement. Therefore, I think that maybe...
SPEAKER_03: So the thing is Devon, he got noticed his minuses, his weak points from the last match with Dennis. He will come prepared.
SPEAKER_03: uh ready and i think he can surprise and make it 50 50. so the match now is 50 50 because devon progressed from the last time to this time yeah he made uh he made uh work he made work based on his previous match with devon yeah who is dennis and and where does he think that dennis is right now compared to five years ago
SPEAKER_03: What do you think about Denis' form now and five years ago? How far is he from that form? I think we are all not young, so I think that the form was better then. But it seems to me so.
SPEAKER_03: We are not becoming younger with each year. And the thing is, on his opinion, surely his form right now is not the same as it was before. We are not getting younger, but just remember, Denis is 41-42, while Devon is the one who is 48. He said he progressed a lot since the last time, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, we don't get younger over time, that's true, but Denis is 41, and Devon is already 48-49, under 50, so here too, you know. Yes, well, there are different data, that is, Denis won more due to strength indicators, it is very important for him to have great strength. Devon won due to
SPEAKER_01: In his genetic data, technically, it seems to me that Devon uses his levers a little better. This is my opinion. And here, to be stronger, Denis should be just physically stronger. And Devon, he has an advantage in his hand, he has an advantage in the fact that he is resilient.
SPEAKER_03: so the thing is yeah it's true about the things that they're age different but uh we need to take a consideration of different things such as for example denise used to win through the power and right now for him to win he need to get the same level of power which he used to have before what's on his under some opinion it's quite harder rather than
SPEAKER_03: devon is becoming more experienced and he used his advent things like for example like his little arm is longer yes and he's more enduring and he's more endurance so the thing is that's what makes this match 50 50. okay so basically iraq is saying that devon is gonna win
SPEAKER_03: Rustam is saying it's a 50-50 match and you Vasily how do you see this match? Oh I know both of them, I agree with both of them. I'm scared of hand of Denis but I think Devon is gonna show us some surprise and he become prepared for it. I would say 55-45 to Devon. I understand. And you David?
SPEAKER_00: um i think there's 50 50 because that is the question of the both both side sides that's uh if the good shape uh is the dennis and uh uh how much strong is the like um outside maybe maybe then this is the stronger than the day one now in the somehow but uh they won't have like another case to for winning so this is too much questions to predict this much so it will be just
SPEAKER_00: see if then it will be enough powerful to beat him easily or if it will be tough much and there will be different techniques and do you guys talk around you know david in the gym you know what does generally people think
SPEAKER_00: like there is in our gym that is too much on russells and most of them is the fun of the devon larynx so if you take take the votes like votes that's the devon is the uh i i i i i'm curious that but you know devon devon's two recent laws are only to to georgians
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you're not the only one. Yeah, you're not the only one. But the people in the gym are the fan of Devon. Yeah. Like the if if the Dennis will from Georgia, then the question will be more to answer this question will be more easy. But no, no. But what I'm just saying that, you know, like, instead of their guys, they are a fan of Devon.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Like Devon, I think that's... No, no. Instead of Gennady, instead of Levan, they are fans of Devon. That's what I'm trying to say. Oh, you're going to repeat me? Like the question, you're going to repeat me? No, no. You said that the guys in your gym are Georgians, but they are Devon Ladak fans. While in their gym or around there, two guys, Levan and Gennady, are the ones that actually beat Devon. So instead of being Levan and Gennady fans, they are Devon Ladak fans?
SPEAKER_00: no you know yeah yeah they they you know and i i don't know how but they won't have something what like young arm wrestlers uh like like the one you know like where we are to the gym where we just now have preparation time that is like 30 30 like young arm wrestlers and uh i know that okay who do they support who do they support when gennady and devon was competing who were they supporting
SPEAKER_00: You know, there is someone smiling, you said, maybe in the hearts they will find out more about Devon. Wow, that's interesting.
SPEAKER_00: But Georgian, how to say it, if we will take that they are Georgian, if we will include that they are Georgian, this is the same thing. But if we will cut these things that's like Georgian nationality, what it means, then their meanings is more for cyber. I understand. I understand. Anyways, guys, thank you very much. Rustam, do you have a last message?
