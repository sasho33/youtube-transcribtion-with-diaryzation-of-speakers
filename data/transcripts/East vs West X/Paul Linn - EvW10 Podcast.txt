SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm tired. I'm tired, but also... No, if you have good genetics, if you're a smart guy, you know, why not if you love so much, yeah? Look at Takashi started at 35. He's still killing it. No, it was 80-kilo category. Also, tournament matches will not affect the Supermatch results from now on.
SPEAKER_00: tournament and um no call can I already announce that um yes you are right Clarks yeah hello arm wrestling hello um we will probably see school boy yep we saw before and we will see again and
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I feel fine, I feel fine, just tired, but... Hello, no, you just make it the normal way, but on the, on the, yeah. Like this? Yeah, on the stream, correct, you know. Okay. How are you? Good to see you. I'm good, how about yourself?
SPEAKER_00: I'm good, good, good. A little bit tired, but I don't know. I will come here. My tongue is coming from you. What's that? No, whenever I talk, I also hear my voice from your side, back. I don't know. I also have the comments showing over the screen. Okay. Yep.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, echo. That was okay. No, it's still coming, sorry. Here, let me come back in. Okay. Thank you, Adnan.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if he has the headphone. Okay. He came. Sorry. Late reaction. How is it now? Any better?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And your voice is also was, volume was so low. Now is everything is okay. You look like you're gaining some weight. I won't be surprised if you say you are 230. I'm 220. Yeah. 220? You look like 230. No, 220. About 222, right around there. Right where I normally get during football season. So how is everything? Can you train? Yeah. Do you have time to train? Yeah. I still train.
SPEAKER_00: I still train. Where there's a will, there's a way. You can always find time. Yeah. Did you have a chance to watch Irakli and Rustem? Yes, I did. I just watched it last night, I think. Yeah, they are ready. I told them, you know, how the things are going to work. Because, I mean, you know, originally you and Irakli agreed to pull, but, you know,
SPEAKER_00: It is normal and better idea, the winner to pull against you. Yeah, I'm good with it. Whatever, whatever happens. I mean, it makes it, it makes this event a little bit more fun to watch for me because I got a fight now. It is, it is tougher and tougher. And we will see probably the most intense event.
SPEAKER_00: that I organize because of the tension between Dennis' side and Devon's side, you know? Yeah. Yeah, some people think that there is no tension at all, but there is tension. You can sense it on the live feeds and on the podcast. You can sense it. Yeah, yeah, but you sense only like 20% of it. I know more. I bet.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah but it all will be uh in the sportmanship and everything i already made sure and i will continue making sure everything will be fine yeah yeah what do you think what do you think how do you see them you know like i don't know about preparations you know how do you see i don't know um obviously you know you want to support the guy from the west you know i definitely
SPEAKER_03: support Devin and everything. Um, but it's interesting. I've been talking to a couple of people about how like the online perception is changing. Like Devin came in as the favorite and it's slowly shifting. Um, and I think people don't realize the, the, the global popularity of Dennis. You know, like I was talking to Pradeep about how often Dennis is Googled as it compares to Devin. It's more than, more than Devin.
SPEAKER_00: Yes. It's unbelievable. Um, I don't know. Constancy is important, you know, like, like it needs to like, because Devon is always there for years and he is making every day, every other day video, you understand? When like, sometimes people are curious or something or someone that they don't know deeply, you understand? It's a new thing, you understand?
SPEAKER_00: So we will see how it will be like going this way or is it going to be a temporary, but as of now, Dennis looks like is the most searched, uh, puller. It's unbelievable. He looks to be in phenomenal shape too. Like he's lean, he's leaned out. Um, obviously he's not in his biggest form, but man, he looks good.
SPEAKER_03: that age do you think he is a little bit like for example like more ripped than his prime or a little bit maybe maybe i mean i think he's leaner i mean obviously that's what i was saying yeah he's definitely lean and you know that's a tougher thing to achieve the older you get
SPEAKER_03: you know with metabolism slowing down and everything so i mean it's a testament to the to the the preparation that he's putting in for this match i think uh
SPEAKER_03: I think he's taken it incredibly seriously. And that that I mean, it has to be it has to be in his favor that he doesn't really have other matches set down the road. He's only focusing on this one. Devin quite often had, you know, he's booked a year out. So for me personally, I know I operate best when I only have one date on my calendar.
SPEAKER_00: nothing else to worry about so i think that he is also missing something by doing this uh less than devon is doing because um like like devon is trained when i say train i'm not talking about outside of the competition he is trained at the table you understand he has he had so many matches while dennis is just i don't know how comfortable
SPEAKER_00: he will feel at the table when you are pulling that seldom. Also, like some advantages and disadvantages. This is what I want to say. Of course, one main focus. But Devon is the type of guy that is just somehow he's handling everything, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's unbelievable. He's definitely special in that aspect. I couldn't imagine living his life. I wouldn't want, I wouldn't want that at all. He's got so much going on. It's constant. Uh, but it's the benefit of being able to live arm wrestling too. I mean, that's, that's what he lives and breathes right now. And you're right. The experience level, those repetitions competition that's invaluable. You can't replace that. Do you, do you realize that how fast the things change?
SPEAKER_00: about the perception of people, like about Devon, that only not long ago, he was labeled as someone who is afraid to pull against the Eastern guys. And now he's just pulling one after another, one after another, one after another, like no one has done except John Brzee, you know, that he also did it a lot, you know. And he's still doing it. John is still doing it, you know. Absolutely.
SPEAKER_00: I can say that I think John has pulled more international supermasters than anyone else in the last two years. Probably. I wouldn't be surprised. He's been all over the place too.
SPEAKER_03: When you talk about that stigma that surrounded Devin about not pulling the Eastern guys, I mean, that's one of the cons of the WAL. Having folks under contract there, only having a small group of people that you can compete against, having no choice in really who you're competing against, and then the divide between WAL and top eight. Top eight's over there, and everybody perceives that that is the standard, and here we have a couple guys, WAL guys, that
SPEAKER_00: you know believe they can compete that's the beauty of you know the climate that we're in right now um people didn't understand that no people people compare this with something that is the opposite intention and opposite case you know like like totally like different you understand the one is dividing one is unifying people didn't understand it but i know that time will show that like
SPEAKER_00: you know, I don't want to talk about it, but just sometimes you just need to, you know, and just, just let your works do it. You know, the things, I mean, how can you argue with lies and things like that? You know, you just do your job. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's a wise man once said, never argue with fools because at a distance you can't tell who's who. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So yeah, the actions, actions, yeah. And how is your form now? You are like, I'm sure you are not pushing the limits. You are saving it for the right time because how is it going?
SPEAKER_03: I got the stem cell treatment and I took four weeks off. This is the first time I've taken off from the gym. And that was like the only thing I could train really to stay away from my shoulder was hand, wrist, pronation, anything elbow down. So I did all that. Did you not do anything to your elbow? No, only shoulders. Okay, but if I do it to my elbow, so I won't be able to even train that one, right? Well, I mean, Devin doesn't take any time off.
SPEAKER_03: you know he does he goes you know everyone has done this so many times i think yeah i think devin i figured you know with the amount of effort i put into the stem cells i was going to follow what they what they advised and they have i they advised four weeks of of no heavy lifting so i did that um and that's the first time that i've i've stayed away from the gym for longer than a week how much did you lose a lot but it came back yes
SPEAKER_03: I mean, you got to think, Ang, and I've been in the gym five days a week pretty consistently since I was 14 years old. That's just what I do. How are your, like, injuries, pain, like, is feeling? I don't know yet. I don't know yet. I've just gotten back into kind of heavy lifting, you know, like the movements that bother me, like bench press and shoulder press. My numbers are coming back very, very quickly. But you are not pushing right away, right? You are just... No. No, I'm at it.
SPEAKER_03: So I'm doing, like when I do bench press, I do reps of 315 to avoid injury. Like when I'm at peak, I can do around 20. And I started at 10, each week I'm adding one rep, three sets. And, you know, so I'm climbing, went from 10, 11, 12. So everything's going good. Okay. Okay. So, but so, yeah, so you lost a lot. When you say you lost a lot, you're talking about size?
SPEAKER_03: No, not really. More like just the gym movements, just the gym movements, the gym-based strength. Is it because you cannot do it or you prefer not to do it that high? I don't know. I mean, I think I did lose endurance, you know, like it took me two weeks to get the endurance back. Now I'm back, you know, but this is new. This is uncharted territory for me taking this amount of time off. But I think, you know, everything I don't know yet, like
SPEAKER_03: I know the stem cells can take, you know, they can be active for however many months. So I'm no worse off than where I started. And I'm hoping that it's slow progress and pain. Table-wise, after that time off, I've been doing one or two sessions a week now. So my elbows are... Did you also start slowly for the table time or you just right away pushing? Yeah, I went right back to it. Someone like you, so professional.
SPEAKER_03: when you love so much when you miss so much even you cannot control yourself no yeah and i get in that from now i won't call you 100 professional 99 yeah i'll tell you when like i we've had some guys come to practice and everything i've gotten to pull with el cesar and uh some of the other guys and actually ian carnegie from canada came down so when we have some some good guys in a big group i i can't i can't help myself
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but when you choose those training partners, it's hard to, like, if you choose them to train with, then, of course, you're going to push the limits. But if you choose some, like, junior guys or something, you could just go easier. Yeah, but it's been good. I've been traveling. I've been traveling. So Saturday practices with my guys, Thursday practices in Maryland. I got to pull with Paul Talbot, a bunch of guys meeting up down there. So it's good. I'm nice and tender, though. I'm tender. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: okay but how did the elbow like everything else feel at the table i mean my my shoulder is not something that stops me from arm wrestling um i'll feel it but you know when you're pulling you don't feel it feel it yeah it's the next day and then when you go to the gym and everything the range of motion but no i mean like right now it's just you know taking four weeks off of the table i didn't realize how much elbow conditioning i would lose
SPEAKER_03: Like, I'm back to those beginner pains, like, you know, the break your radius pains, like the ache. I'm kind of enjoying it in a way. How did you perform? Good, good. How it happens, because you rest so much, you are strong, but then because you are able to push so much,
SPEAKER_00: damage also is uh big you know yeah soaring it sore in the in the in the in the it's good soreness it's not bad soreness there's not the injury type yeah no i feel good i feel good i still feel good strong and feels good so yeah yeah yeah yeah a good event i already said about 10 matches for the east versus west 11. 10 already like i am like i'm like like
SPEAKER_00: i wish i wish i could set like 16 17 and the community wouldn't complain about it because like there are a lot of guys that i really need to you know uh fit but like i feel guilty when i can't invite someone that you know i should invite you understand but then then i look at the numbers from top down and i'm like yeah and you have passion for this because like i mean you understand i want to like
SPEAKER_00: Do it. I feel guilty. I feel like I am disappointing people when I cannot invite as many as I can. But just the reality is there that it takes like five hours then, you know? And then people get bored. Were you there when Jerry and George Swetko pulled? You were there, right? I mean, after all those 15 matches, I think it was 16 matches again or something. I don't remember. And then because of the level of the event, like,
SPEAKER_00: when like if you would put jerry versus georgie as like like fifth match of the day people would lose their mind yeah but because all the adrenaline was like done you know we were like watching like no emotions you know like like nothing left well in like every match especially when there's good matches too yeah like if there's a good match and everybody's yelling it's almost like an emotional dump afterwards too so yeah yeah it
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I love it. I'm like in my element. I can't get enough of it. But I understand the perspective of like, oh man, how long are people going to watch? I'm just, you know, like when I don't go, I buy the pay-per-view and I go about my day. I watch the matches and then I re-watch it, you know, watch them one at a time.
SPEAKER_03: uh and i find that to be the most entertaining is when you can say all right i'm gonna watch this match tonight you know yeah um thank you for the super chat thank you i didn't read i'm trying to read j mania
SPEAKER_00: Engin, you're amazing for all these matches, so thank you. Paul, you are a beast and love watching you climb, but how did Devin's right arm feel when you pulled? I pulled Devin a couple times throughout his process to get where he's at. I pulled him right after LeBron, and then I pulled him again
SPEAKER_03: um not not too long ago let's call it like a couple months ago and the second time he was an absolute different person a total different human being um so i can only imagine where he's at right now in preparation for dennis because i know how serious it is but the guy i mean his pronation is is unreal
SPEAKER_00: unreal even when he lets out a lot he lets out some rope and lets you get where you want to get he is unreal and i pulled him throughout i pulled him out in years past as well um and i gotta believe this is the best version um sg records roman brother paul seems to be kryptonite to georgians iraqli may put streak to an end so paul slow it down a bit i want to bet on georgians next time
SPEAKER_03: Roman, Roman. We got it. We can't count our chickens before they're hatched. We have to see if Arakli beats Rustem. We don't even know. And I mean, I have the utmost respect for Arakli. So if I can even compete with him, that pure top role, how clean his back pressure is, his back pressure in general, I would just be honored to just be able to compete. Hopefully I can slow him down.
SPEAKER_00: you versus him would be also interesting match but you we don't know who will be your opponent yeah um because iraq has very good back pressure while rustam has an iron hand um can i ask you something about how did rustam's hand feel hand when you try to go outside um like so it's interesting because like in the setup
SPEAKER_03: in the setup like usually when you're feeling somebody's hand out his hand itself didn't feel intimidating in the setup it's it's after the go like the shutdown like the clamp on your hand when you're trying to hammer curl or drag because i even tried a low hand open topple um the match looked so bad because of the the lanes i was choosing he just shut down completely um can you say that like
SPEAKER_00: Around those weights, like, he probably had one of the strong hand and wrist, if not the strongest. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That lane, like this, like this downward snapping into your pronation and into your back pressure is something I feel at the heavier weights. Like, like... But that's the case with everyone. Yeah. Nobody could top roll him, really, you know. In his prime, like, he was just, like, he would just...
SPEAKER_03: What kind of movement did you feel? Did you feel the movement like this or more like side? Only wrist and then side or mixed with that? Mixed? Down. I felt down. So, like, people a lot of times will say, like, people, I feel like people confuse down pressure with supination because they go hand in hand. But the clamping down here and then the fluid, boom.
SPEAKER_03: like yeah there's situation to it but the pressure is coming through his fingertips down and then there's this tendon the the bottom tendon here yep the bot yes the bottom tendon i heard you reference that too i think he probably has and that's a thing you know i think that's a thing that's where my strengths are even though i spent years top rolling and working on the top tendon my genetic strengths come in the bottom tendon
SPEAKER_00: Yep, yep, yep. That's why I'm thinking that this is very, very hard for a top bowler to beat you. Very, very hard. I'm not talking about a specific person, but just, like, very, very hard. You know, if someone is trying to go outside with you, his chances are lower than a very strong hook bowler. You know, this is my opinion. There is another one. Jeffrey Lutyens.
SPEAKER_00: Always positive energy around Paul. Soon champion again. Hopefully one day. I try to keep it positive and productive. Yeah. 44% stronger is curious about Devon's challenge to 95 kilo. I would answer for Paul, but he will answer for himself as well. Don't take that seriously. Devon will never go down to 20. 95, guys. Yeah, like
SPEAKER_03: Like, Devin is a large human being. Now, could he do it? Yeah, maybe he could do it, but it's going to be for a split second. Devin would weigh 95 kilograms for all of about 15 minutes from the time that he gets out of the sauna and steps on the scale. For him to continue to come back to that is not realistic. I mean, even years and years ago when WAL was at 225 and everything, Devin had to –
SPEAKER_00: Sorry, Bob Brown just called me. I'll call you back, Bob. I cannot hear you. Hold up. Can you hear me now? We're low. Can you just touch the volume down and up or something? Bob Brown called. And it messed it up. Ah, okay, okay. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_00: Any better now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear you. Yeah, yeah. They are asking if I saw Dennis' last photo. Yeah. The guy looks so ripped. You know, he's just... I don't know. I don't know. I really don't know what's going to happen with that match. I don't think it's going to be easy. No, I don't think so either. Yeah. Endurance. Endurance will be important. Some people think that
SPEAKER_00: Devon's endurance is not good anymore. They are judging by Gennady match, but we know that Devon's inside endurance wasn't good in that match. And outside he couldn't pull because he didn't like the way that Gennady was countering. So he had to pull inside. And we saw for many years that if Devon is pulling 100 times outside, you just see him once in a while that he's trying to go inside.
SPEAKER_00: except lately. So you cannot expect him to have the inside endurance as good as his outside endurance. While this match, I don't think that he is going to go mainly inside. Even if he goes mainly inside, Dennis will not be pulling him in the same way that Gennady was pulling. He will be more like bicep, you know, from Dennis' side. This is a very interesting match. I really don't know
SPEAKER_00: Some people think that Dennis' endurance is not good. The guy, trust me, has crazy endurance. He regenerates so quick. So is Devin. I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know. Yeah, it's hard to predict. I think the most interesting part about it is we're not going to see, I don't think we're going to see a fast match either way. Like,
SPEAKER_03: I think that it's not going to be one sided like you can look at the Devon Hermes match. And, you know, there was a lot of there was a lot of time spent in the setups, but the matches themselves were quick. I don't think we're going to see that. I think we're going to see some grinding matches for sure. I just don't I don't see I don't see it being a one sided match at all. No, no. I mean, people, people sometimes misjudge us.
SPEAKER_00: when they look at the score trio they think that it's a one-sided match you know yeah i mean like it is totally up to how the match went there may be three matches both all of them are wars and then like the score doesn't always represent the difficulty of the the match here anyway so i can't hear you now
SPEAKER_00: so you are focused on 95 kilo as we spoke and do you you said that maybe time to time you may be open for 105 but you are on a mission is that correct what how i understood you yeah yes yeah yeah i feel like
SPEAKER_03: I feel like I've made a home. So my body, like even when I'm in football season and I'm not eating as clean and my life is jumbled up and I don't have the structure, like I still, my body doesn't want to be much more than 225. So like 225, I could be, I can like, it would be hard for me to walk around at 105 without being uncomfortable. But I would like to take matches in that weight.
SPEAKER_03: I just might be a little bit under. But I think that my sweet spot for where my body is most suited is 95. Yeah. So you are saying that if you are going to pull, you would choose to pull a match that is serving your dreams. Yes. And there's a piece of it too. Like I've tried to explain to people in the past to talk about cutting weight. They're like, why do you cut weight? Why don't you just gain weight and not worry about being fat?
SPEAKER_03: You know, 95 and I've, I've almost gotten to the point where I don't want to say I enjoy cutting weight, but I see it as a part of the process. Um, and of course it's not easy and it's uncomfortable, but I try and live my life in a way where I'm putting myself in uncomfortable situations, you know, and trying to be comfortable with it. So like when I go over to Turkey, like, yeah, it's not fun, not eating, watching everybody else eat everything else. But when I step on the scale and when I, you know, when I've done that, you know, eight weeks lead up and preparation.
SPEAKER_03: and prepared, when I make weight, I feel like I already won once and I already build up some momentum. So to me, it's part of the process and it's part of being a professional. And I think if everybody, if all the arm wrestlers that we see right now competing, I think that their true weights, you know, where they would be optimal at a lot, or a lot of times they're going to be 10 pounds lighter than the category that they compete in. Like, I think if you want to see the best at a weight category,
SPEAKER_03: you're probably going to have to have guys who are willing to be professional and cut weight. And you look at, like, the other sports, boxing, MMA, that is just how it is. Just cutting weight is just part of it. And if you want to be the best, you have to find the weight class that you're going to be the best at. And, I mean, we've seen guys like George Rush St. Pierre do that for years, you know. And we're talking about people who look at the weight cuts that I do and say, how do you do it? I'm like, no, no, look at these MMA guys.
SPEAKER_00: I'm cutting 15 pounds, 20 pounds. These guys cutting 35 pounds, you know? But if you want to be the best in the world, I think that's part of the process and part of the sacrifice. So you are saying that weight cut, like, does it affect power? I don't know. I think that the most I ever lost in sauna or something was like,
SPEAKER_03: just say like seven pounds, six pounds, you know, I never, but I don't know the other way that, you know, you are drinking, drinking, drinking, and then, and then, yeah, then the thing I know it, but I never done it, you know? Yeah. So I think if, I think when you start talking about the extreme cuts, there's definitely detriment. Like when you start talking about 25 pounds, 30 pounds, I think the recovery is going to be harder, but at East versus West where we have, you know, the 24 hour, 30 hour,
SPEAKER_03: recovery time, I don't see anything. I don't see any drop off. The other point is the mental piece. For me, when I go through that process, it's almost like a mental purification. And when I get done with that and then I start rehydrating,
SPEAKER_03: The body, you know, it's almost like on overdrive in absorption of calories and carbohydrates. And when I've restricted myself for, let's say, eight weeks in carbohydrates, when I give myself carbohydrates, it's almost like an energy burst, you know? I actually perform the best I think I have in my career, like throughout my career when I've done a solid weight cut.
SPEAKER_00: So I don't know, like, you know, the numbers wise, if I'm losing power or not, but I'm definitely performing optimally when I cut. I mean, compared to pulling above class is still, you know, you are, it's better to pull the lower class, right? Like, I mean, there is a, there is a difference between power, you know, sometimes 95 kilos.
SPEAKER_03: Sometimes, sometimes. And I think, I mean, at the world level, I think it's a little bit more prominent. Sometimes in the United States, if you go to a big tournament, you could find an easier way to a first place at the higher weights. But I think at the world level, there has to be, there's definitely clear increments of power as you go up. There is a super chat for you.
SPEAKER_00: Top World is asking, is it possible for Paul Lin to pull Engin Terzi at 85 kilo after down with 95 sometimes in 2024? And how does he see this possible match technically? Paul is 100 kilo, almost ripped guy, you know, him to pull 50 kilo. I know, I know the question is not to me, but just like, am I right? You know, like, yeah, it's just like, yeah, like, you know,
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I could do it. Like, I could make that weight, but it's like saying, Devin, make 209. I could do it. Yes, I could do it. But for me to do that, I would have to lose probably five to seven pounds of muscle mass, which I'm not interested in losing. You know what I mean? You would lose significant power. Yeah, I would lose. I could do it. Like, if I was looking at making 187,
SPEAKER_03: because i know i could do it but i'd have to do it like if i'm walking around at 220 now i'd have to be walking around more like 202 and that means i'm losing probably seven pounds of fat and seven pounds of muscle and that is not something i'm looking forward to doing but you know who knows if somebody said you know somebody said the perfect thing in the world
SPEAKER_00: The comment says that ripped pole is 20 kg heavier than ripped engine, and that's true. Like me, ripped, trust me, 165 pounds. You can be sure of that. You ripped probably 209. Yeah, yeah. 209, 205, 209, 205. But see, when I go to 93s in 2000... Yeah, I know, that's pretty... Yes, I know that.
SPEAKER_03: it's like you the two people that i think about when i think of like the lightweight pullers and like the the weight difference it like craig tia always comes up to mind like craig pulled like 143 back then didn't he too one one he even yeah i think yeah maybe he won't pull 132 143 years when i pulled him raw final he was 143. yeah yeah it's unbelievable and i see craig at like 205 and still ripped and i'm like what
SPEAKER_03: Is he really 205? No, no, but I mean, he has been. I've seen Craig. Is he around 190, walking 190? I would say 190, 195. It all depends, you know, at that time of year and how he's eating. He's very, very disciplined too. But like in the WAL days at the 205 weight class, I know when he pulled Rob Vigit Jr., he was 205. And he probably dropped a few pounds to be 205. So that guy, and he was still lean.
SPEAKER_00: And then I think of like 143, I'm like, how is this possible? Yeah. But I, I never, I never can make like 200 pound ripped or something, you know, like around my belly right now is I think 40 inches. Yeah. Yeah. 100 centimeter. Yeah. The thinnest part in the morning, empty stomach. I have seen it like 77, 80 centimeter.
SPEAKER_00: So if I'm that ripped, and I have seen you, every time I weigh in you, you are totally ripped. If I would be ripped as you, as the guy said here, like 165 maximum. So let's talk a little bit about the event.
SPEAKER_03: What were you expecting if the match wasn't canceled? My match? You were expecting Samusha to dominate or you think that I could give him some trouble? No, no. I mean, I talked to you. What? I talked to you enough to know better. You know what I mean? I don't understand. You're laughing and talking at the same time. What was it? I talked to you enough.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I talked to you enough in preparation. Yeah. At the same time, you know, listen, I, I know, I know where your head was at in preparation for that match. And I know the decision process process behind taking it earlier rather than later. So for you taking it earlier.
SPEAKER_00: rather than waiting another round or another event. Do you know why people started writing that, you know, it is unfair to his opponent, you understand? To just... replacement like 10 days before the event is too close. So I didn't... you're talking about my decision? No, I'm talking about your decision to pull Samukhia at that date.
SPEAKER_03: i'm talking about like not needing another tune-up match or another match like to me to me that says that says you're ready i thought you were talking about my accident yeah okay no i'm talking about your decision to do it sooner rather than later that speaks to me because like that means that you know something that everybody else might not know no no no you're wrong about this do you know why i'm crazy
SPEAKER_00: You understand? I always tell to myself, I mean, you have been inactive, you are injured. You should be ready and then set a match. And then every time I say that, but I find myself in a position that I set a match and try to be ready for the match. You understand? So that is wrong. If I was young, yeah, it's good. But right now I still am not like you can be a hundred percent and still
SPEAKER_00: May not beat Davut Samushev. We are not talking about a regular guy. This guy is rock, you know. He only lost to you, but you were heavier than him at that time. It still wasn't easy, you know. So to be 187 and beat this guy is looking not possible, you know. And we will see now that Tuziev is there, but I don't know. So I don't think that like I knew something.
SPEAKER_03: I just like to... No, no, no, no, no. I thought that this would be the biggest event in history, and I just wanted to be part of it, you know? But, listen, you can get a lot from talking to somebody about how they feel, you know? And when you're picking these matches and stuff, and you're also an arm wrestler, and you get to talk to some of the other arm wrestlers, a lot of times when I make a prediction or if I have a feeling about a match, it's based off of the energy that I'm getting.
SPEAKER_00: from somebody you know what i mean and i got the energy i got the energy from you that you were ready so i don't think that that match was going to be one-sided and i don't think that samusha was gonna i will tell you only one thing that if if i knew that top rolling him was gonna be enough to beat him then yeah that match would be mine that's all i can say like taking his wrist if it would
SPEAKER_00: give me the guarantee of winning, trust me, that I will just say I'm going to beat him 3-3, nothing. But that is not the case. You need to be prepared more to control his pronator so he wouldn't stay like this, but like this. This and this, different story. Yeah. So the same thing about the touchings. You can take his wrist, he will be going. But if you do like this as well,
SPEAKER_00: then it is not that easy anymore, you know. You need to really, like, the way that Prudnik beat Todd is the way to beat Todd, you know, because he had the cup, you know, he had the wrist control. Just doing this, no way he will hit you like a train, you know. But he sets the strap in a way, too. Like, people love to criticize Todd and say he's just side pressure. I think the guy is an absolute technician.
SPEAKER_03: You know, he knows exactly what he wants. He, he, he has a spot. Like a lot of people want that bottom strap way low down here. He doesn't, he wants it. He doesn't want it too high. He doesn't want it too low, but it's higher than most people. But he has, he has an entire process behind where he wants that thing. So that if his risk goes that, that strap doesn't move and he keeps his pronation. That's why, that's why he's able to pull the way he does. And it's, it's, it's tough to bet against him too.
SPEAKER_00: know yeah yeah there's certain guys it's tough to pick against yeah yeah that that's that's uh did you hear about those three matches that i announced which ones before the east versus west uh 10. i'm not sure yeah there will be three uh left arm world title matches oh yeah yeah yeah but the morozov kurdecha maybe
SPEAKER_00: changed, you know, maybe changed, you know, I can tell if it changes, I will tell, uh, and then I will tell the reason as well. Um, but for now, for now there are, there are some good matches and today, today, just today, I said, David Arabuli versus Lachlan Adair. Yeah. That should be a good one. That should be a good one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's going to be a good one, yeah. And there will be some other matches as well. And then we will see. So, Ruslan Mirakli, what do you expect from this match? Your next opponents? I don't know. I mean, you know, it's the classic hook puller versus top rope puller. So, it's going to come down to basically, you know, if Mirakli's pronation can hold up, you know, and throughout all of the rounds. I mean...
SPEAKER_03: The closest thing I have to compare it to is watching Iraq a couple years ago against Sasha. I think Iraq could potentially steal around. But if Rustam gets that down pressure on there, we might see a one-sided match from Rustam. I have a hard time predicting this one. I've never pulled Iraq. I have pulled Rustam, and I know how his hand feels. But I also do rate Iraq extremely highly.
SPEAKER_03: Like as far as global elite top rollers, like he's, he's right there. So if Russum can contain that, that's, that's unbelievable, especially after some of the time that he took off and everything, and now coming off that injury. So the injury too, we don't know where that's at. I know he said he's, he's back. He accepted the match. So I gotta believe it's, I gotta believe it's good. Um, but that's another X factor. So I don't, I really don't, I don't know. I don't know. I tend to, I tend to, I tend to root for Russum.
SPEAKER_00: because I would like to put, I would like to pull them again. That is your spirit is very high level because, uh, this reason, that reason he got injured, but you want that match and you want to pull him again. You kind of feel like you owe him this match. Like when I saw him, like give him this match, like give him this opportunity again.
SPEAKER_03: And also you kind of feel like you need to prove that you can do it, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think, I think it's more even like, if that's a match that Jerusalem wants, then I feel, I a hundred percent feel like I owe it to him, you know, as far as, as far as giving him an opportunity, you know, to write what, what, what potentially rightfully was his.
SPEAKER_03: You know, and then the flip side is I want to prove to myself that, hey, I did belong to be there. Yeah, I did belong to be there. And, you know, now I have a little bit more data too. So the approach would be a little bit different. Yeah, I understand. People think that John is very heavily favorites against Sasho. Do you agree?
SPEAKER_00: With that, or you think that Sasho may be dangerous? We know that Jon is very strong, but we know that your performance against Sasho is also based on your explosiveness. You are just probably one of the most explosive guys. I mean, I hardly follow with my eyes how fast you go to do that.
SPEAKER_00: pin pad with your dragon, you know, and then, and so since John is not that explosive, I expect Sasho to engage more than he could do against you in early rounds. Yeah. So do you think that John is really that heavily favorite or like it will be closer than what people thinks?
SPEAKER_03: So, so I think John's a favorite, but I don't have it. I don't have the margin really broad. Um, and there's a couple of reasons for that. Um, we, we, we saw, we saw Todd and John. And I know Todd's probably in best form of his life, but what, what Todd was kind of able to do with John, um, and that side pressure and everything, which Sasha is, is, is very similar as far as like side pressure style, you know?
SPEAKER_03: Like if that lane's accessed, if Sasho can access that and get a little bit of cup, then it's going to be side versus side. So, um, but then the other piece of it is, is John's John's hydraulic pronation. Like even when you turn John, even when you have him pull him up, he quite often, he, his, his pronation is statically and slowly coming back as you surge. And as you hit.
SPEAKER_03: He's taking more and getting more and getting more. And I've never felt any type of static pronation from a supinated position like I felt with John. So it leads me to believe that it's going to be a close match or it's going to appear close. You know what I mean? Even if it were, you know, 3-0 John, I don't think it's going to be quick. So again, this is a tough one to pick. I do have John as the favorite, like if I had to bet money on it.
SPEAKER_03: I would probably be betting on John because I just think he's so savvy and he has so many weapons and so many options. But there's always variables around John, like how healthy is he, you know, the age and stuff. It plays a part. And Sasha was only, I mean, he's a baby. He's only in his mid-20s. So structurally, he's at that physical peak and John's, you know, at the tail end. But I think it's going to be, I think it's going to be a really good match. It's going to be a really good match.
SPEAKER_03: It would be incredible either way it goes, I think. I agree. It's going to be a tough one. And Tatashins versus Ungar, where? Oh, my goodness. I love Todd. I love Todd. This is a tall task, for sure. Because, I mean, when you look at Irakli, or not Irakli, but when you look at Ungar, especially when you get to see him arm wrestle live,
SPEAKER_03: like in person, it's like, it's like watching figure skating or something, you know, like he's unbelievable the way he moves. I think he is possibly pound for pound, the best pure arm wrestler on the planet. And, you know, I know Devin made the comparison of best technician versus worst technician. I think that's garbage though. It's garbage. Like Todd, Todd is so much more technically savvy than people think.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's a tough match. It could potentially be a tough match for Todd stylistically when we see that phenomenal hand control, the smooth rotation, all those things. But on the flip side, Todd has had some of the biggest wins and most success against those pure top rollers throughout time. Whenever you look at Ongar Webb, I mean,
SPEAKER_00: you see you see a top roller yeah but you see a much more than a top roller that this guy hooked him live and beat him this guy pressed michael todd this guy was losing iraqli here he brought it and he did that ninja move you know were you there when he did that
SPEAKER_00: I was like, what the hell, you know, this is not the practice that you are doing against the somehow mature or something. There's Iraq, this is a cash wheel, you know, and then you are trying to, you are not dominating the match and just didn't fantasy or something. You are barely surviving from a very bad position. The guy is just like what I just tried to say that the guy is more than a topple. Like you may even take his risk. Have you seen him versus Alex? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's a warrior. Yeah. Yeah. This is what I am saying that he is much more than that. Like, like you really need to dominate him, you know, with the pressure, which Tatashin has, but will it be enough or not? I don't know. Another big question mark, you know. I think, I think, you know, we have to look at it from like a black and white perspective. Um, you gotta make Angrabaya the favorite, um, but.
SPEAKER_00: Like, I think Todd Hutchings has way more than a puncher's chance. Like, I like the match. I think if Todd stops it, that's the beauty of it. I just want to see Todd stop it, and I want to see it get ugly, you know? I will tell you something. You say, like, you want to see Todd stops him? Like, I kind of think that it may come to a point that Ongarbe may need to stop him because of the pressure, you know? Right.
SPEAKER_00: I don't see anyone is dominating anyone like this. I think that if Todd goes strong, and then Kidergali is going to stop him here, or Kidergali goes like this, Todd is going to... I don't... I may be wrong. I may be wrong, but I kind of see that the power level technique, everything here goes, and then it says no domination. It will be... Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: somewhere, you know, before the pad, you know, either way, you know. Yeah. Yeah, I can't wait. I can't wait for this card. Same feeling I have for Dennis versus Devin match. Like, I don't see, like, I don't see anyone. It's going to be a grind. It's going to be a grind. That match is going to be a grind. I don't think anybody, I don't think either of those guys is in a position to finish it quickly.
SPEAKER_00: You know? Yeah. I mean, I can say in my opinion, honest opinion, like about arm, Dennis is stronger than Devon. My opinion. But about the hand-wrist coordination, I think Devon has more experience and more capability. But whenever I see
SPEAKER_00: Dennis, even in the trainings, his finishing power compared to the past is like he has more control, less finishing. Less, yeah. Yeah, yeah. In the past, he was more attacking people's pronator and dragging, you know, beating. Now he wants to pronate. So his pressure from the downside of his hand over the pronator is a little bit less than before, but outside is stronger.
SPEAKER_00: So he is stronger. He may have the position to finish him. Finish Devin, it may not be easy. Devin may stop him at the beginning, but to finish, you know that you need to finish Dennis really quick, you know. Once he engages, and then his left will be like a tractor, you know, he will be pulling
SPEAKER_03: just step like this and at the same time is also pronating so i see a war and then but dennis needs to be careful to not to be open like this because we know that devon has that domino present well that that that to me is an interesting point too because when when we look at devon most recently uh the biggest struggles he's had he's had and even self admittedly is with people who can execute a committed dead risk press
SPEAKER_03: So, I mean, I wonder, you know, if Dennis, if they're both in that dragging open style, if there's going to be a window where Dennis can, like, you talk about the lack of finishing power, is Dennis going to have to come forward and give his wrist a finish? And can you do that? It depends on how open Devin is. If Devin is open, trust me, Dennis has that kind of power to press him. If Devin is that open, if Devin is closer,
SPEAKER_00: then he may block him with his elbow joint. But when you are open like this, it is weather. And since it is against the rules, neither of them will be allowed to go like this. The best position, they can have this. Nothing like this. If it is in a neutral and losing position, so I don't know. I expect a war. Did you know that we will have the spectators on the stage? Spectators on the stage?
SPEAKER_00: On the stage? On the stage, yeah. There will be at least 100 people on the stage. It will be like a U, you know, where the LED will be lifted up to like two meters. And then there will be three steps, you know, the spectators eight meters. Yeah, like a pitch. Yeah, like a U. Stadium seating. Yeah, stadium seating, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's cool. That's a step in the right direction. It's what WAL was trying to do. At least 100 people, because many people from community, they were complaining that, you know, and then whenever I watch it, I'm like, yeah, this is just like, it needs to be, you know, Paul, people think that people are not allowed to come to East versus West. You know it, that people are, like, people think that there are not many people. There are 300, 400 people.
SPEAKER_00: But it's just a big auditorium that everyone wants to sit, you know, separated from each other. They don't want to sit together. You see 30 people there, 20 people there, 30 people there, 20 there, 30 there. But this time on the stage, you know, yeah, they will be sitting together and it will not be 100 people because a lot of people are going to come. So I think auditorium will have at least
SPEAKER_00: 300, 400, maybe 500 people. So I think there will be a lot of people. We will see. In the future, I have better plans for the future, but we will see. So let me get this right. When we're cornering people, you tell us to get off the stage, and now you're going to put 100 people on there? Yeah, but it's just different reasons. Those are spectators. Those are spectators, you know, yeah. Yeah, I say one people, you guys go there, five people. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: The arm wrestlers in the corner can't be on the stage. What's it for random people? Yeah. We will do. Even the trainer will not be... I think I'm going to put those couches between the corners of those three. I don't know how it's in English. And then the trainer will be behind the couches.
SPEAKER_00: seat you know so we will see we will see like all together we're gonna talk more and then we're gonna make everything even uh better and better and we will see yeah yes sir yeah i mean either meaning there are so many good matches yeah yeah january 20 january 20 yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: Yep, I can't wait for that too. So we're going to the playoffs. We have a bye week and then we have a playoff game. So at a minimum, I have two weeks left. If we win, maybe another week, maybe another week. But it's at the tail end of football season. I can go back to doing double days and traveling a little bit more for arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_03: You can still train, right? When you go playoff, you can still train, right? Yeah, I still train. I like to do double days. I like to do a morning and an evening. I like to split things out a little bit differently. So I do singles now. Okay, when you do single-day training, you feel like you're not training enough, huh? Well, I do the same volume. I just do it all at once. But when I can do, like, all right, I'm going to do this, this, and this in the morning, and then I'm going to rest.
SPEAKER_00: And I'm going to do this, this, this in the afternoon. I feel like Frank, you know? That's good. That's good. That's good. Wow. Complete athletes. I know. I know. Like, like I remember there has been times that even in my prime, I was just doing one, two, three, four with table time, five trainings in two weeks. Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. That includes even one general body training, like chest and everything, which I usually don't count as a training. You don't count that? It is necessary, but I kind of dislike it. I like to train. I got you. I'm kind of the opposite, though. Yeah, you like to do all the benching. I was on the bench. You like bench more than pronation?
SPEAKER_03: yes and i'm not i don't even like bench to be honest i mean i do everything i do everything but uh yeah what's your favorite training uh well i mean like back in the day i used to do the explosive lips like the power cleans no no today today today today oh my favorite my favorite day is is back day and shoulder day
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, back and shoulders. I can't believe that this guy is right there in arm wrestling. His favorite day is the shoulder day.
SPEAKER_03: Can you believe that? Hey, shoulder is a big part of the chain. It's a big part of the chain. But nothing tastes like forearm training. Oh. I do it all. I do it all. So, like, if I'm doing a set of military press, I'm doing my rising pressure in between. Every set of regular gym lifting I do, I do a set of arm wrestling specific. So, I get matching volume for all arm wrestling specific movements along with general strength.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Okay, before we finish, show us your bicep and I will see where you are. Ah, good, good, good. Like, I really, I mean, think that you are what people don't realize because you always have that smile on your face. People doesn't realize how dangerous you are. But people who knows arm wrestling, they know it. I know arm wrestling, I know how dangerous you are, how
SPEAKER_00: hard you can hit somebody's pronator with your wrist and side pressure and that dragging you know it is very very very dangerous you know i got it i still remember this still here like tell me what i can't do it tell me what i can't do yeah it was one of the unforgettable moments in the east versus west history yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: That was fun. Pure emotion. That's the beauty of competition, though. And I love starting over in this sport because I can be more positive. Do you miss it? Do you miss being there? Oh, my gosh. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? I love it. No, to me, this is great. I love the rebirth from my background into this sport because it allows me to take some of those things that maybe I lived in a too negative way
SPEAKER_03: in the past and now i can be more positive but that doesn't mean when it comes time to compete that i can't flip that switch the switch flips competition is competition and you know if you're a competitor um you can be as nice as you want but on the day of competition you're probably not going to be nice yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah anyways we miss you too and hope to see you very soon and thank you for joining and
SPEAKER_00: Always a pleasure, Angus. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I miss chopping it up. I'm going to try and get on the fix tomorrow, see if I can swing that with my schedule. But, man, I miss it. I feel like I've been starving here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways, very, very soon to see you. And just take care of yourself and watch that match very carefully.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, sir. You know I will. You know I will. I'll buy it now. I'll be able to replay it. I won't even look at it on YouTube. I'll look at it on Core Sports. You bet, dude. Yeah, absolutely. You need to set it up where people can buy like they can get a yearly subscription. So we don't even have to do the process. Just like click the button that says I'm buying all of them from now on right now.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, all year, right? We should do that for next year. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, my friend. Thank you very much for being our guest. And it was great to see you and keep in touch. Yes, sir. Yep. Working on that one too, ain't it? Yeah, yeah. It looks great. It's great. Take care, brother. Take care. Thank you. Yep.
