Engin Terzi: Hello, John. Hello, Ingen. How are you? I'm doing good. Good? Much better than last week. That's good. That's good. That's good. Yeah. I can't remember where the damn camera is. All right. All right.
John Brzenk: i'm at my uh grandkids house in uh in utah so i don't have my um my uh laptop so yep so so how have you been you said you are better than last week yeah well as you know i thought i thought i got another scare of uh
John Brzenk: covid um i called you what friday saturday morning just like oh my god i can't believe this is happening to me but as it turned out it was just uh i think a little little flu bug bug or common cold so definitely over it um don't have the body aches anymore just have the the sinus and the you know the little chest congestion still but yeah a thousand percent better than i was uh last weekend yeah very very happy to hear this last week yeah i thought that you know you couldn't make it
John Brzenk: Yeah, no, I didn't know what to do. You know, I, you know, that night I had the chills and fever and the next morning I could just was numb. I was like, are you kidding me? You know, what do you do? You know, a week away, you don't want to, you know, or two weeks away. I didn't want to, you know, let anybody down by, you know, having it get worse. But I'm glad I didn't didn't kind of stuck with it and crossed my fingers. I'll get it over with, get done. Mm hmm.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I was just training. It just finished. I just finished it. Oh, you're doing some training? You're working out? Yeah, yeah. I want to pull it in November. I'm in the gym now. Big match, too. Strong guy. I don't know if I'm going to pull it. How does it look? Good, huh? Not bad. Yeah, no, no. Way better than mine. I wish I had that for you.
Engin Terzi: because of this wall people think i'm in the restroom i'm in the gym actually oh okay nice gym really nice gym yeah sometimes you need to come a little bit early or a little bit late go back and yeah you need to come and maybe
John Brzenk: I showed you the gym. Yeah, it's been a long time. You know, it's been, what, shoot, I think probably 25 years where you were showing me all the different crazy exercises that you did and all the very innovative devices that you had, you know, with the wrists and stuff. So I'm sure that you've been updated on even that kind of stuff. But yeah, no, you need to do that.
John Brzenk: How is everything with the wrist and thumb? It's a little tender still. I've been doing everything in my power, absolutely anything and everything I can do to rehab little aches and pains I've had. I told you I went and got some bloom performance in Phoenix. I'm getting needling with electric stem and infrared.
John Brzenk: know massage and just doing the pt stuff for my shoulder and hand and wrist and um i've come up here to salt lake city before i'm leaving to dubai and uh an outfit that i've done the nad trip i did it yesterday i'm planning on doing it again today and then i'm going to do it on monday so um i'm doing everything in my power to be 100 and getting healed up so we'll see we'll see how it goes see if it makes a difference
John Brzenk: yeah yeah yeah yeah i think i'm well i'm well rested yeah you're arrested i'm well rested so i mean if i get rid of this little congestion in my head i'm going to be a thousand percent yeah yeah yeah um i train with arif you know him
Engin Terzi: yeah oh yeah of course how's it going man good to see you yeah he's giving me training so far all right yes show him how to get bigger he's bigger than me no no yeah this is this is this is like my like like almost like own brother you know just he gives me training to uh get ready so that i can be ready uh yeah i know it's like that's something bigger and stronger than you to really push you
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah yeah and he's just like like um we just checked something it was very interesting i don't know if you can see it here but let me do like this maybe you will see but can you put your hand but look at how tall his his hand is oh wow wow yeah i know he's a bigger individual for sure yeah yeah he's so like yeah but that's what's that that's what's made you really good uh
John Brzenk: And again, I classify you under the same kind of build as a Todd Hutchings. Big hand, strong hand, but short forearm. I mean, compact. I mean, so that shorter leverage allows you to apply so much more side pressure, you know, your stability. Yeah, but you need to have a very strong hand, strong hand to control the guy. Otherwise, it's going too far. It's no good, right. And you have that combination. You have short forearm, thick forearm, but strong hand. Yeah, strong hand. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: so this is how it is we will see november 11th and you you have november 11th also another one and then so we better not announce now so we need to focus first on the legendary yeah yeah this match i hope people understand how important how big this match is that like like you are the biggest name in our sport you are the like hands down like by far the
Engin Terzi: coach and while alexi is like how to say like he's like a more like he just he came made a big impact and just left and then since that time people talk about him like for 20 years what if i let you come break what do you want yeah yeah yeah yeah
John Brzenk: I bought into all the excitement and hype. I truly believe that Alexi probably is the most gifted athlete arm wrestler arm wrestling has ever seen. And not that he hasn't put a lot of focus and energy on the sport, but that he but yeah, he's he's just to me, he's he's got the full package. He's not only strong, big hand, big forearm, wide palm.
Engin Terzi: Very explosive. So, I mean, he's got everything. Yeah. I kind of believe that this guy could have been world champion in multiple sports, like different, because the guy is just so gifted. I was in Dubai to pull against Ray, and he was there as a guest. And the way that he is moving, he is over 40 years old.
Engin Terzi: but he's just like 20 years old guy, you know, he's just like, you know, I saw him how he was- Very, very agile, like you can't- Yeah, yeah, how the way he kicks the sandbag, how he punches, like you could see that this guy is just, I'm there, just make me a boxing champion or just a judo champion or arm wrestling champion. The guy could be something like almost like not,
Engin Terzi: everything but like many things he could have done he did already with the bobsleigh he would become only the champion and you know yeah right yeah and then it is like neither of you in your like prime but but the the value of this match historically to me is just like like like highest level of the legend legends like i don't know if i can really um
Engin Terzi: put his status as legend. He was so short time, but sometimes you do something so unforgettable that, you know, that like, like his 2004 performance, you know, at this law teacher, what, what, what was your, your condition at that time? I remember you were suffering. Definitely.
John Brzenk: i was i was basically giving up on the sport when the pulling john crew came around um i i hadn't been pulling for maybe a year year and a half uh just had chronic uh tendonitis in the elbow and i just decided it was time to to call it quits but because of them i ended up
John Brzenk: getting back in the sport and fighting back and um um yeah when you saw me at that zloty tour final uh of course i i lost weight i ended up weighing in at 95 kilos i wasn't a very big guy um at the time and uh so my condition was was so so i mean it wasn't um it wasn't the worst condition i've ever been in but um it wasn't by far the best condition that i've ever been in either so um i'm hoping that for sure this this even though i'm
John Brzenk: 20 years older, I'm actually in better prepared, better condition this time around than I was back then. What do you think about his pluses, like his hand and wrist? Oh, his hand and wrist are incredible. Yeah, I know. And he's so explosive that it's just really hard to deal with that hard hitting sweep that he has. It's kind of the open hand explosive top roll that Cobra had.
John Brzenk: So, yeah, I think, you know, seeing or thinking about what made me good are kind of the similar traits, but he's just bigger. I think maybe a little stronger, a little faster. So I know what's effective against me. So I'm hoping that maybe employ that against him, but yeah, he's, he'll be a tough, definitely a tough challenge, especially after the go, just, just stopping the matches would be,
John Brzenk: know 99 of it if i could stop it then then i think i've got chance yeah yeah do you do you expect him to be
John Brzenk: like uh how how good do you expect him to be like well i you know we talked about this before i mean he's he definitely you know his last comeback i don't know how much he trained um how how what level he got to but he didn't get embarrassed by tim bresnan but i don't think alexi likes to lose and um getting defeated by anybody um
John Brzenk: I think it's definitely lit a fire under him for this go around. I don't think he's going to be unprepared at all. I think he's going to do everything in his power to be completely unprepared. So I expect him to be quite a bit better than he was when he had his comeback with Tim Bresnan. But we'll see. I don't know if he's going to be able to achieve the level that he had at the Zloty final, but we'll see.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah it will be very interesting and and like how do you what's that how do you see your chances
John Brzenk: um honestly i honestly i don't know all i know is that i'm you know i i prepared as best i could prepare for this my diet's been good my training's been good um i worked out hard i had a really hard match with todd hutchins so my tendons are i mean i think hopefully they're healed up from that because they're a little little tender still but i mean i've done everything i can possibly do at my age to be be prepared for this so i mean
Engin Terzi: That's all I can do, you know, and I, you know, it just depends on what kind of condition he comes in and what kind of genetic freak he really is. Yeah, we'll know in a week. I understand. Yep. There are some other matches like Rambet versus Matt Mask. And how do you see that match? Usually Rambet is beating Matt Mask, even though it's a tough match. He's beating with the dead wrist and the side pressure.
John Brzenk: It all comes down to weather, how conditioned, how strong, how well
John Brzenk: uh what ron bass hand strength is like i mean i think he's still got plenty of arm strength plenty of press um if he gets his hand taken out of position by matt then it's going to be a long hard day for ron but if he can maintain any kind of position with his hand and wrist in or out of the straps i think i think ron it's probably the stronger arm you know arm wise side to side
John Brzenk: Uh, so yeah, it'll be, it'll be exciting one, you know, Russ getting up there though. I saw some photos of boy, even on the promo video of the king of the table, it's like, where the hell did you guys get that? Did you Photoshop it to where he's 80? I mean, it's, it's, uh, you know, so we're all getting up there in age and it's, that'll be a factor for sure. I, um, I know, you know, what is, is, uh, Matt, he's, he's not any spring chicken either, but, um,
John Brzenk: i think he's probably at least 10 15 years younger than ron so yeah we'll see we'll see how the old guys hold up usually matt approves him and ron still beats him with the yeah he still has that capability if he's tied if they're in the straps and that happens i don't give up on ron i still think he's got the ability to probably push through matt yeah yeah yeah let's see let's see let's see how it will be but um we saw matt i think matt is in a very good shape
Engin Terzi: uh as of now but do you remember the match that rambet had against chan show that recently beat him not recently but like maybe like less than a year but he is still being much still was able to beat him yeah yeah and then like three rounds or right
John Brzenk: so yeah it's not easy i put chance on a very very high level i know he had like a little hiccup with uh oh like for trinko but um yeah he's he's proven that he is top top top gut level guy yeah yeah top and arm strength so um yeah so that makes me believe that ron runs and still pretty damn
Engin Terzi: damn good shape for his age yeah yeah yeah yeah i kind of see like maybe i give they normally i don't do prediction but it seems it's not my event so i'm a little bit more comfortable like i give the edge to mad match but still like 51 49 52 48 i won't be surprised if rambet beats him it goes either way right yeah it should be it should be a hard fought match so yeah i'm excited to see that one for sure yeah yeah there are some other ones too lachlan versus krasimir
John Brzenk: all right um yeah you would think that would be an arm strength hook war right i mean i don't think krazy unless he really feels something unusual with uh lachlan um i mean i i wouldn't put it past pressy to be able to top roll if he if he had to go there but i think he's probably going to try to prove prove himself prove to the world that he's you know one of the top hookers in the world but he's up against a really good guy against you mean krasimir will try to prove that he's still there or you
John Brzenk: i think i think if he gets in trouble or he feels something that he doesn't you know doesn't like he's going to be able to maybe switch to that i mean i'm not putting it past him i've seen krazy try to top roll um which left obviously left on each approach right arm is all inside it just stays in there he's gonna die die with the hook yeah it's gonna be a good match lachlan definitely has is seemingly yawning gotten stronger right it keeps getting if size makes a difference um which
John Brzenk: don't have any reason to believe that you know size equals more strength he is what he is and he's getting bigger so he's obviously uh he's he's obviously going to be stronger so it'll be it'll be a tough challenge for uh krasimir so when you say that this is top challenge for krasimir does it mean that you give the ash to lachlan
John Brzenk: I think I see the match, Lachlan being a little more explosive, maybe getting the match on his side of the table a little bit in the hook. But Krasi's got that stopping power, that defensive hook and with great endurance. So if it goes anything longer than 10, 15 seconds, then I'm going to start placing my money, you know, on Krasi. So you are saying that Lachlan needs to kind of dominate him. Dominate him, be explosive.
John Brzenk: one like joint versus muscle and then then cross him yeah yeah yeah he needs he needs to really jump on it hard and fast if you can get him out of position um and maintain a really good position then maybe he can outlast him but um i would i would if i was lachlan i would definitely have a little bit of urgency in my in my style and making sure it gets over with as quick as possible yeah
Engin Terzi: will see we will see that that is that is very nice event we will see how it will go and there will be transfer versus kalishenko don't know um other one i just saw him pull with matt i mean it's uh
John Brzenk: Yeah, that's another great matchup. I mean, those guys. People don't understand. People think that the card is not special. To me, it's very balanced. Very, very well. Very balanced. Whoever set these matches up knows arm wrestling very well. Do you have anything to do with that, Ingen, or what? These are all really close. I mean, as much as I hate to say it, I think my match is probably the biggest mismatch.
John Brzenk: Oh, come on. But we'll see. We'll see. We'll see. Maybe I can surprise a few people. I don't think that you are underestimating yourself as much as you are saying now. I think that you are not like that inside of you. Yeah. I think that you believe in yourself more than what you are showing right now. I know in my mind that I'm physically as prepared as I possibly can be. So that's all I can do. Yeah. Yeah. But you don't know what you are going to meet.
Engin Terzi: yeah no i don't i have no idea what alexis bring gonna bring to the table but i'm i'm as prepared as i can be let's see let's see it will be nice even even just to see to all you coming to the dead table yeah just like like amazing amazing yeah i don't i don't really care sorry but i don't care who wins there i mean i hope it's gonna be a good match and like
Engin Terzi: Everyone knows that I am a drum bruising fan, but I hope it's going to be good. But that's not my point. My point is that you two meeting after 20 years, coming to that table, it is just like... So give me some advice, what should be my approach? Because you know how I am with endurance. I normally like to get set up pretty quickly and don't really fight too much on the start because I'm really trying to...
John Brzenk: conserve every ounce of energy that I have, but with Alexi, it might be the one guy out there that I could possibly maybe screw with a little bit and, and gain a little bit of an advantage. I don't know. I mean, obviously he's probably in a way better, um, lifting, uh, gym condition than I am. Cardio is probably way better. Uh, but you know, based on, based on explosiveness still is based on explosiveness.
Engin Terzi: If you can, with your pronation, just like make his wrist like neutral and stay in this position, you know, people could depend on hand and wrist control. Once they cannot have the full control, now they are in a different battlefield and then they are not experienced because they
Engin Terzi: I feel for myself as well. We like to dominate. We like to dominate. Once you cannot dominate, then the things are changing because the person is so much used to playing that game while you are not because you are so much dependent on and you dominate 98 times, 99 times, 98% of the times, 99% of the times, you really dominate.
Engin Terzi: But the one or 2% that you cannot dominate and your wrist is like in a neutral position, stays like this. And then that is the time that you are in trouble. So if you can put his wrist to the, you are so much used to pulling like this. I have been lately. Yeah, lately I have been. I remember like you have been doing this, even the time that you pull against,
Engin Terzi: Tata said you couldn't hook him. And then once you realized that you couldn't hook him, you were just turning, pronating, even you didn't have full wrist control, you were still pronating, right pressure open. And then you did that to Denis Cyplenkov in Vegas, like you were still pressing him like this. I think that you have that muscle memory. If the match goes there, you're a favorite. If you bring the match to there, I don't know, we will see. We'll see.
John Brzenk: I think you're right. I think I need to somehow flatten that dominant hand and wrist that he has, which will be the big question how to do that. I'm going to try without the strap at first. I think he'll be easy to set up with. I feel like I'm going to have that ability.
John Brzenk: whether or not that's an advantage for him or not um i question whether or not i could take away a lot of his advantages by getting into the straps i typically don't feel as good in the straps as i do out of the stress but he's completely different individuals i mean he's i i i see him as a as a me but bigger and stronger so i'm thinking that he possibly would also feel probably a little bit more um uncomfortable in the straps than he than he would without the straps
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he's so much dependent on his copy. And trust me, he has very good one, very good Henry style. No, I don't want it to neutralize like like Tim Breslin was able to do that. Right. And then then then the things can change like your biggest weapon.
John Brzenk: can be your biggest weakness because you are so much dependent there. Once the weapon is taken away from you, then you are not that effective, yeah. But I've changed. I'm more in the last six, seven supermatches I've had because of my shoulder and I don't want to be super aggressive. I rock back into that almost just concentrating on hand position and back pressure than I do attacking with a good cup and going to the side, which hopefully will help me in this match.
John Brzenk: How about the dry needling going? Dry needling's been good. I mean, the truth will be next weekend. I really haven't done any arm wrestling practice to really test to see how it feels, but it's definitely relaxed a lot of the muscles. I mean, initially when I was doing it, I was getting a lot of spasms and a lot of, you know, it was triggering a lot of crazy cramps and stuff. And the last one I had,
John Brzenk: wasn't so bad so i think that area has definitely calmed down quite a bit but uh but we'll see it's definitely tender i mean it feels like uh you know it's been under you know on daily life daily life you don't feel any difference at all um yeah no i mean it's it's um it feels like someone's punched me i mean it's it's the muscles are tender after dry needling yeah yeah yeah
John Brzenk: did you feel anything relaxed more there? Yeah, I feel like I have more mobility right now. I feel like I have better stretch. Whether or not that's going to translate to being able to fire that muscle and keep it tight and as far as strength goes, keeping my elbow close to my torso, the test will be on Saturday. I'm not going to mess around or try to test it now. I've done
John Brzenk: no no no recession so i don't know exactly but i've done done that with along with electric stim so they've been going pretty deep and then applying electricity to it to really to really loosen it up uh yeah i think you need some time to also rest it as well you know you cannot yeah i'm doing it all the time yeah and people are asking why we are not on the same screen
Engin Terzi: i made a mistake if i would do this directly from youtube it was making a like a perfect uh split screen but i i did through zoom and when you zoom when there are less than three people it is just going one person at a time you know so they explain to people yeah yeah sorry yeah yeah i'm i'm happy i'm happy that you're feeling good both as like health you know and then and the shoulder um
Engin Terzi: Devon't forget about the Kinesio. Kinesio tape also for back. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that helps me so much. I use it, and after the, like, match, like, I have sometimes back problems, and then, you know, it is not allowed to put on the arm, but, like, here, shoulder job is allowed, you know? And whenever I use it, after the match, I feel like, you know, wow, like, I don't have pain. You know, maybe I shouldn't even use it. Right.
John Brzenk: take that off and then i start feeling pain you feel looser right because yeah it takes the pressure away some some yeah even if it's nothing more than just mental that's it's definitely uh it's definitely can't hurt right so i'm definitely gonna like i said i'm not leaving anything um last on the you know on the sidelines i'm going to use everything yeah what you could do right yeah yeah yeah yeah but it's not psychological trust me it helps you know so much yeah
John Brzenk: I don't know. I don't know. We will see. We will see. And we just can't wait. What's your weight now? 105? A little above 105. 235 this morning. So almost 107. Yeah. So as bulky as I feel comfortable getting.
John Brzenk: Like you said, November, we're talking maybe I'm going to have to go on a strict diet. I need to really maybe do the things that I always say that I'm going to do, the cardio. But it'll be nice to be forced to do that, and we'll see what November brings, see if I can be a little leaner, meaner machine. I have another question. 2021, July, you made a comeback.
John Brzenk: and it has been a little bit more than two years. How do you see yourself? Like you are here or you are here or you are here? Like to me. Yeah, I think the first year I made some, you know, definitely noticeable gains. Hand and wrist got stronger, tendons in the elbow, everything like that shored up a little bit fairly quickly.
John Brzenk: As I progressed and gotten actually better and able to put more pressure side to side, it's definitely caused my shoulder to be a little bit more unstable and sore. If I can figure out how to,
John Brzenk: get rid of that, get that healed and tighten back up where it doesn't just turn to jello. I mean, I think I can continue to get better. It's the limiting factor for me right now is that rear shoulder. So if I can get that sorted out, I think even at my age, I think I have
John Brzenk: you know, the ability to be a little bit better than I am currently. But I'm pretty much, I think, hit the ceiling now as far as, you know,
Engin Terzi: um as far as the hand and grip the forearm goes there's small things john that's small things like small injuries something you know it's not small it's not small yeah but it makes so much difference john yeah like one well yeah and then then completely you because people don't understand people talking about using stuff or something using stuff is just something different this is we're talking about some part is missing that it it changes everything if your arm is just
John Brzenk: moving here without so much resistance to keep it here. I mean, it makes so much difference. So once it is fixed, it is adding you 15%. Well, I mean, I even hate to think about it or bring it up about it. It's almost, oh, it'll be a year in January, I think, where I ended up hitting that ditch and running my thumb back on a snowmobile on my wrist. That still is tender and sore. I mean, I could be in the best shape of my life
John Brzenk: But one little, little, you know, little reminder of injury. It completely shuts me mentally down. Like, oh, you know, I'm, you know, especially the wrist. And the wrist actually feels really good going outside. But when I get put into a hook, just that turn down, that stretch of being, you know, down on the wrist, it throws a little jolt of lightning. Like, wait a minute, something's still sore there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: They don't understand. Once those unhealthy parts become healthy, if it's possible, then you are a completely different person. The problem is figuring out the therapies and the supplements and things that I...
John Brzenk: are available to make me heal it's i you know um well you'll see as you get older but i mean it's not the same as in the 20s 30s even 40s i mean um it's just little little injuries that would be gone in a few weeks uh are lingering now for months you know it's just like yeah but it is what it is i mean i'm i accept it and i'm
Engin Terzi: I'm doing everything I can to deal with it and we'll see. Listen, we are, we are, we are so happy that you are part of our mercy. I don't care. Yeah. Yeah. I don't care what people say. And you know, all the time says positive things about John. Come on. I mean, if anybody is deserving, this is the guy, you know, and like when you are in a, in an organization, everything is just like so much fun. I appreciate that. Thank you for that. Yeah. I mean, I, I, I mean, I take,
John Brzenk: some of the criticism to heart like yeah maybe i should retire and quit but
Engin Terzi: But then again, why? I mean, I am who I am. I'm the same as the other thousands of arm wrestlers that are out there. John, come on, come on, come on, come on. Like, the guy is that, like, I mean, you are still head-to-head with anyone that weighs as much as you do. Yeah, as much as, like, we don't even know. Like, Kata Shinks, even after he beat you, he said that John is a guy that, you know, you beat him, and then he finds out, you know, what to do. He comes back and beats you. Even he knows it, like...
Engin Terzi: like you could prepare prepare yourself differently it's not the first time he beat you he has beaten you before you come back and beat him as well so this is nothing else to do like you lost against iraqli come on that match was a hell you know for both sides just like so you are still competitive as long as you don't pull the super heavy weights like those giants as you used to pull you don't need to do that and i kind of believe that you shouldn't do that because it is really kind of limiting
Engin Terzi: It will maybe shorten the picture of our message. Yeah.
John Brzenk: maybe maybe so but i still enjoy it i mean if if i can even have like a one in a hundred shot i still i still like no okay yeah i wanna i want the shot yeah of course of course if there's if there's a glimmer if there's a glimmer of hope at all i'm i'm for it if i if i feel like i'm going in and it's just going to be destruction then i'm not so
John Brzenk: yeah but just don't don't think that he may cause some more serious problems because yeah no i i'm i'm i'm seasoned enough where i'm not gonna do anything stupid i'm not i'm i'm i don't feel crazy enough to put myself in a well a knock on wood i say that i mean everybody probably wants you yeah no i twisted myself up pretty good with the rack lay i guess now that i think about it
Engin Terzi: listen you are not you are not as normal as you are portraying yourself you are also a little bit you know i remember how you were trying to go down to 86 kilos to beat rustam uncle rustam got injured and the match was canceled you were going for the third title now we talk about like devon may have the third title by beating on guard but we need to remember that you were 95 kilo and over 95 kilo was open category when you had the open there was 95 105 115 and
John Brzenk: now probably you could have at that time like four categories maybe yeah have you have is the uh the november card you haven't announced all the competitors for them no i don't know i don't know i will announce this is a good card good card okay you saw it you saw it right yeah i saw it it's super exciting i mean yeah and i'm glad that you've changed a couple of matches to make them
John Brzenk: Tyler Gordon?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 2?s
John Brzenk: NAD, yeah. NAD, what's that? Well, it's a big, long, nasty name that I can't pronounce, but it's kind of the latest, greatest cellular rejuvenation, you know. Oh, for your injury? Well, it's actually done by IV, so it's throughout your whole system. Oh, okay, okay. Let's go, let's go, let's see. If it is good, just let me know. Yeah.
John Brzenk: it's um while you're doing it it's uh it makes you very nauseated and ill it's very uncomfortable but um i did the first session uh yesterday um and for sure i definitely felt way more um alert and had a lot more energy so we'll see i'm actually doing three sessions i'm gonna do one today and then on monday before i head to dubai yeah just just write me this all right
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I will read two superchats we have and then I let you go. Michael Workspace, Engin and Goat John, two super legends. I am a big fan, he says. Logan Misiak, I have a question for the goat. John, are you going to try to crack his wrist back? This might hinder Alexei's side pressure and pump his arm.
John Brzenk: I mean, I don't think, I don't know if I would ever be able to crack his wrist back to actually fully top roll, Alexi. I just don't, I don't envision that. But like we talked earlier, as long as I can keep his wrist straight. If I can keep it straight, then I can turn into a Todd Hutchings maybe and just supply enough side pressure to actually finish the match with both hands flat and, you know, yeah.
Engin Terzi: in a flat position perhaps. I think that's the way to go. Going inside, as you said, that you may not be able to use your shoulder as you used to be.
John Brzenk: Yeah, I haven't pulled really strong inside for months now. Um, I mean, I, I of course try to do it in practice, but it's been uncomfortable before my wrist when I'm turned down that hard and I find myself actually protecting it. Um, and when I'm in a hook to actually be, be pronating to try to top roll, even though I'm in a hook, we'll see. I mean, we'll see, maybe I can possibly do that against him. Um, I don't see it happening, but yeah.
Engin Terzi: John, just to explain to the newcomers the importance of the forearm that you have been competing for more than 40 years. During these 40 years, what are the times that you felt a pump in your hand and forearm? And how many times do you remember your biceps pumped?
John Brzenk: Yeah, well, I think, obviously, you know the answer. Well, I'll tell everybody else. I know, I know. What normally causes arm muscles to give up or to quit or to fatigue or to basically go away, it's not the pump of the upper arm. It's the pump of the forearm. And it's not only that you're losing your hand and grip, but it's really even difficult to keep your arm at a strong angle when the forearm's gone.
John Brzenk: so um yeah because you're good it's so important for even just maintaining an angle so um yeah obviously conditioning in the forum is is big huge key in the sport of arm wrestling yes yes yes like once once your hand finish your predator finish once you're finished your arm bicep let everything finish your head give this and then
John Brzenk: you are this type of puller. And even do this test, which I'm sure you've done before. Pump your forearm up to the point where it's just gone numb with doing wrist curls or whatever, and then try to pull somebody in a hook. So you're not really relying supposedly on your hand and wrist, right? You don't need to hang on anybody either. They're actually staying wrist to wrist with you. But let's see how effective you are pulling when your forearm's pumped even
Engin Terzi: No, you cannot. If people are thinking that the hook is about bicep, it is not. This is about you need to control the pronator. You need to control your own pronators. You know, this is all about like, how can you, I have a pronation machine. If my hand is pumped, I cannot even turn that thing, you know, because I need to have a proper grip. I cannot do
Engin Terzi: pull up without that i cannot do roaming i cannot hold the dumbbell you know like if the hand finish everything finished but whatever behind it only only if you have a strap then maybe you know you can just with the arm string you can hold it yeah yeah anyway so uh any any any message to the community any message to your fans or any message to your opponent
John Brzenk: just just you know i'm excited um i'm heading out to dubai on monday i i guys i'm as prepared as i can possibly be obviously there's there's the the factors that i have no control over um like little little sickness bugs and things like that but um i'm i'm going in excited and optimistic and and as prepared as i can be so wow yep anyways thank you john for uh spending time with us and
Engin Terzi: Have a good week, you know, until the competition. All right. All right. Talk to you soon. Take care of yourself. All right. Take care. All right. Bye-bye.
