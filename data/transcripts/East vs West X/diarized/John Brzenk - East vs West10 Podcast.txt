Engin Terzi: brain to the rest of the body here. The trapezius, especially where I hit. Backside of my shoulder, I feel like. But tomorrow, tomorrow we will see. Hello, hello, Jorge. I'm missing Titan. Hello, after Eastward 11, we will see Qadir Ghali. Whenever Evgeny is ready, he's going to pull. Evgeny has been injured, has been injured, my friend.

Engin Terzi: Why don't you organize arm-wrestling events in India? My friend, I don't organize arm-wrestling events in China, in Japan, in Kazakhstan, in Africa, in South, everywhere. I don't organize. Artem you talking about qualification events? Qualification events are not exactly my events. Those are already existing events that their results are used as qualifications.
Engin Terzi: I can ask, yeah, if I don't forget Victor. Salma, Salmi, Merhaba, yeah, yep, Merhaba, correct. Elbow is feeling right now a little better because I didn't train for one and a half weeks.
Engin Terzi: So it is rested, you know, it is rested. Vladimir, hello to Bulgaria. Hello, Andreev. Hello, I feel a little bit better, my friend. Thank you very much, Bosia. Will we ever be able to get
Engin Terzi: more prime john card sign when john is here invited as a guest or as a commentator yes for sure but if he's coming as a competitor we're gonna use his current uh current uh stats i don't know we will find out if john is gonna make 95 or not um
Engin Terzi: What do you think about Devon's little injury, Paul Koenig? I don't know. I privately chatted with him. He said he will be totally fine. That's what he said. Yeah. Let's see.
Unknown: OK, I need to second. I think my brain is just not good. I forgot to send John the link. But still, he has four minutes, anyways.
Unknown: Hello, guys. Hello, hello, hello, everyone. Let me try to check the chat from here. I have bigger... Okay. Super chat. John Joseph. Thank you. Best event in all our messaging. I may
Engin Terzi: open to public, my friend. How do I get in? Who would I talk to? You need to come to Green Park Hotel, Pendik, Istanbul. Unlike people, I don't know. Just ask, you know. There has been many spectators from outside of the country just came and have been watching. This time, we will... John came.
John Brzenk: Ah, now we're back to this angle, huh? Yeah, this is, listen, this looks that way, but whenever on the computer, YouTube, we are like side by side. Oh, okay. Yeah, no, I'm just used to having the phone being on its side instead of upright like that.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, you are advanced than I am. You have East vs. West 9 t-shirt, I have 8. Ah, I didn't even know, I realized I had 9, yeah. How are you? You don't look small. I'm doing good. You look great. Yeah, I've been on the fat, the under 500 calorie diet ever since Alexei. Can I see the bicep? Let's see, I will decide. No, it looks good. It doesn't look like...
John Brzenk: The abs are the trick. I'm starting to... Wow. That is better. Healthier you look. I'm a little lethargic right now just because I'm on such a calorie deficit. My plan was to get here as quick as I could to try to get my body used to it and then maintain it for a while until the match. But
John Brzenk: I don't know. I'm kind of on this kick now where I'm debating. My mind's starting to talk to me and say, hey, keep going. You can make 209. It's just not a wise choice for me, though, to be quite honest. If I'm a practical guy that I normally am,
John Brzenk: I don't know what my chances are at 100 kilos like we agreed on. So to challenge myself, to kill myself to make 95, I think is just like shooting myself in the foot. But I still might do it just for the hell of it. I don't know. We'll see. I don't know. Everyone is just riding. Just do it, John. Just do it, John. People don't realize. Well, maybe some people do. I was almost 240 or 237, I think, when I weighed in.
John Brzenk: alexi so that's 30 pounds and that's i mean um you know that ain't easy ah you're gonna be like 28 pounds down and yet that 237 was just a little bit pushed weight you know yeah yeah no of course yeah it was push weight so yeah but yeah but the last 10 15 pounds has come off easier than i think the next 11 12 will come up that's the problem yeah but anyway you look like you know you lost good amount of fat
John Brzenk: And I see that there's stomach and then arm, you know? I've been trying to, I have some eggs in the morning and then a little protein drink in the afternoon. So almost all my calories have been protein. So I've been kind of trying to nibble on protein to try to maintain some, you know, not have that muscle wasting thing going on with the deficit. Yeah, but you need some carb as well, you know, some simple carb, like potato maybe, you know? I haven't had a carb since.
John Brzenk: three weeks ago don't you feel weak don't you feel weak oh yeah yeah no but i i think you get you know when you get in that catese or ketosis or ketesis or i don't even know what the name is the ketosis mode um i've just gotten used to it now so it's my normal function yeah i mean sometimes i recognize it when i get up and do some menial thing i think oh boy why am i why was that hard to do but um now i've gotten used to it i feel i feel comfortable walking around in this do you have space do you have scale with you
John Brzenk: no i don't i'm in a hotel room right now i've got one more week left in uh atlanta before i head home but how do you know your weight um i went home last weekend and um yeah in the evening i was uh 222 223 in the morning i'm 220 so yeah yeah yeah i know i know i'm close so and after here now the podcast you're gonna go training
John Brzenk: Mr. Todd Hutchings should be knocking on the door in about an hour's time and we're heading to Paul Passmore's house to pull with Ron Bath and the Georgi gang. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm expecting your power to be good. About the endurance, you know, we will see. Without the carb, you know. Yeah. I haven't completely made up my mind to do that, to do the... I mean...
John Brzenk: Like I said, the practical me, it makes more sense just to see if I can put, you know, see if I can do anything with them at a hundred kilos. I mean, why, why, you know, there's always a chance if I, if I beat him at a hundred kilos, then I can say, okay, well, I'm going to go and really,
John Brzenk: know test myself and get down to actually the 95 kilo for the for the you know a title match in the future i know this is a big uh east versus west for you it's a big 10 celebration and you know a lot of all the super matches but i mean um no no this matches listen you're you are i can even make a poll about you are bigger than world title so yeah okay yeah your presence is already great this is what we want that like you do something like
John Brzenk: age of you know late 50s and still like the man you know the best in the world you know yeah yeah well so my chances would be better if i just try to maintain this and and then go in at that uh you know the 220 and then see see where it goes so um i'll know more after today's practice if the guys throw me around
John Brzenk: you know, beat me up and throw me which way the other in practice today, then I'll realize, okay, that's enough weight loss. I'm not going to, I got, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to go there with zero chance of beating this guy. So tell, tell Ron to try this. Yeah. Instead of this, because Sasho can top roll as well, but it's not the way that he's probably not. He wants to pull Artem Taino first before your match. Oh, okay.
John Brzenk: That's the left handed match for him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Left arm match. Yeah. Yeah. And Taino is also very, very strong. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I've, I've watched a few videos of Todd Hutchings. He's looking like he is ready to kick some butt. So I'm curious to see who walks through the door here and see how, how strong and big he is for a Kudagali match. So I know he's probably taking it very, very seriously.
John Brzenk: of course of course how can you not i i what do you think how what are the chances boy i'll tell you what if uh todd's aggressive is as aggressive as he was with me and and knocks criticality off center um i don't know i don't know if he can pull you know todd back to center i mean i'm sure that he can manipulate the hand and wrist and he's going to have better position
John Brzenk: But boy, once Todd gets a little bit on his side of the table, it's like Jerry Catarat, plop, press, press, press. I mean, it's hard to bring that back to center. You just can't imagine the side pressure that he possesses. You know, for me... You stop him. You stop him. Early round, you stop him. You stop him and hold him for some time, you know. Do you think that, like, Kydyrgali has less or more endurance than you do?
John Brzenk: Oh, more. I'm sure. I'm sure more. Yeah. I mean, yeah, for sure more. So, I mean, yeah, if he can with, but boy, yeah. So if he's just got, if he's got twice the endurance I do, then he's going to be in the match and he might turn it around. But, uh, yeah, I was in great shape, uh, going into my pulling Todd Hutchings match and, um, he manhandled me. So I, I, oh, I just, I can't, I can't see, I can't see him losing.
John Brzenk: Oh, so you think he's going to win? I do. I think he'll win. Wow, wow, wow. And if he wins that, and then if you are not making 95, even if you are making 95, I already promised him that his next match will be 95. You know, that's another excuse or reason that I kind of just want to avoid even trying to make the 95 kilo class, because I don't think I would stay there. I mean, there's just too many...
John Brzenk: You know, Todd Hutchings in particular is way more apt for making that weight than anybody. And I can't beat the man when I'm 105 kilos. Why would I try to stay down on that weight class and have to have a match with him at 95 kilos? Yeah, but what was his weight when he pulled you?
John Brzenk: I think he was less than me. I was probably 230, 235 because I was just trying to prep for Alexi. I think he said he was two and a quarter, maybe 220, between 220 and two and a quarter. So he was 10 pounds less than me. But yeah, no, I'm just trying to...
Engin Terzi: How about if you stay longer around this weight? You think you will get used to and be almost as strong as when you are two-thirds? Because it looks like you're losing fat, you know? You didn't look small to me. You know, the arm didn't look small.
John Brzenk: Yeah. No, um, I mean, eventually I think I could get used to it. I mean, I used to be able to, well, even in my, my prime, I would walk around at two 20 and then struggle to make two Oh nine. So it's, this isn't enough. This isn't anything new for me. I'm, I'm where I was at, you know, 15, 20 years ago. So, uh, yeah. So, I mean, I, but you know, I don't know. Waterweight cuts never really seemed to affect me too much unless I was doing really extreme stuff. But, uh,
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I just don't know if I foresee myself even wanting to stay at that 95 kilo, but we'll see. Yeah, if you make it, then you have like at the East versus West, the weigh-ins are Friday morning, competition is Saturday evening. So one and a half days. Yeah, yeah.
John Brzenk: I'm a little more after practice. And then, like I said, next week, I'll step on the scale and see. If I've only dropped another pound, I go, oh, shit. Because I'm already pretty sucked up. I mean, obviously, a lot of the weight was just all that garbage has been, you know,
John Brzenk: overeating oh my god you know so like I said the next 11 pounds will be way tougher than the last 10 pounds were so I'm already I'm already pretty sucked up so are you gonna pull or you what are you doing tomorrow tomorrow after my accident I didn't do anything
Engin Terzi: And yeah, I talked with Paul, Pauline. He said that in the American football, you know, they have these kind of things all the time. And they said that like, it takes about a week or five days or something. But after that, he said, you need to do first a small training. And then, yeah, just to see. But I didn't do even so small training. I did a little bit blood pumping. And then tomorrow, I will do one table time. And then I will see, like...
John Brzenk: I will see how my head will feel and how when I hit, you know, is it connected? You know, I don't know what's happening, you know? Yeah. Well, you're already, like I said, you gave me the same advice. You're already in great shape. The two weeks or whatever it's been now might have done you more good than bad. So I wouldn't worry too much about your power. And I mean, you know, by this accident happening, you're definitely probably very well rested as long as you just kind of
Engin Terzi: Mask sure your, you know, your head's right. Yeah, healthy. Thank you. Yeah, I mean, if I'm healthy, the power that I already have is good, not bad. If you're not healthy, there is something, you know, the coordination would make us special. Our coordination, if there is some weakness,
John Brzenk: the link on the chain, then everything messed up, you know, because the guys are young, strong, you know. Yeah, no, no, I've been, you know, I've had that situation happen to me quite a few times the last year, year and a half of like,
John Brzenk: oh do i go i'm you know i got this or i got that or i'm sick or that but then i keep thinking back of like michael jordan when he played in the nba finals while he had the flu and he he performed better than he ever performed so you just never know i mean i don't know i i think it's better just to put yourself out there and give it a go no matter how you're feeling or what you what doubts you have in your mind just say yeah i'm just gonna do what i'm gonna do and
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah afterwards but anyway there is no shame of losing you know this is I don't think there is anything tougher than the stage at this versus West you know so you win you lose there is nothing to be ashamed you know it's like I mean yeah yeah I mean yeah yeah anyway what was that yeah no go ahead no no just you just say
John Brzenk: I was saying off the subject of arm wrestling, you know, we've talked before about Travis's kid, Tyson. He's starting tomorrow for the Bears. So it's so exciting. I'm going to actually jump on the plane and go watch the game live. I'm happy that you are excited for your friends, you know, son, and then you're sharing the excitement here. I was going to ask you, are you, if you lose down to 209, are you
John Brzenk: how much water cut you plan? Like I said, I'm already, I've already done, um, three weeks of pretty much fasting. Um, and now it's like not coming off very much at all. So if I, if I go another week or two and I've only lost a pound or two, it's going to be 10, 11 pounds of water weight that I'm gonna have to cut. So. Artem you simply like familiar, like,
John Brzenk: I've done 10 pounds before, but I'm not sure I've done it at the state that I'm in right now after, you know, already losing 20 pounds, you know, so it might be, it might be a real strain. Like I said, I haven't really had to do anything strenuous, so I really don't know how bad I feel right now, but, um,
John Brzenk: Yeah, if I feel halfway decent and I've got decent energy, then we'll see. I don't know. I know some guys can do 15. I think Hutchings has got it down to a science, and he's done almost like 20 pounds of water weight cut. That would probably kill me. But 10 pounds, I probably could do. I don't know. We'll see.
John Brzenk: Like I said, the practical me, it doesn't make any sense, right? Especially with the incentive, with the monetary winning. I mean, I'm going to lose weight and possibly lose my winnings prize for what? To prove something? So the practical side of me says,
John Brzenk: Why, John? You're going to risk possibly losing if you make 95 kilos versus... Oh, okay. So you are saying that at 100 kilos, you would have a better chance. Oh, way better. Yeah, I'm going to have a better chance. But listen, let's say 10 pounds of water cut.
Engin Terzi: one and a half day before i'm sure that i my opinion you will be 225 by the time you pull it oh yeah how much power you think that you're gonna lose by losing 10 pounds of water you think you will lose a lot you think that's that's for the experts i don't i don't know i you know you know you know a lot like whenever the athletes want you know i bring hotel a guy that does the the iv with all that vitamin b whatever they think that they
Engin Terzi: Mineral, vitamin, yeah. Yeah, I did that before. They would ask, like, two of them, you know. Okay. Yeah, yeah. I can do that. Morozo, Morozo. Give me real quick. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. What I'm just saying, if you need it, you know. But for every athlete, every athlete that they need it, and you just bring your child, and I'm bringing the guy, he comes, and then, like, whatever it is. I don't exactly know. Magnesium and potassium and all kind of vitamin B, C, whatever. I don't know exactly, you know.
John Brzenk: No, no, no. Renee and I did the drip in Dubai, and it definitely, whatever was in it, I think it was basically the B vitamins and all that stuff. Yeah, yeah. A little bit of niacin. I mean, it definitely, like, even just a couple hours after doing it, I was like, wow, I actually, I can feel this. This is something I feel better. Yeah. So what I'm just saying, after water cut, if you are thinking, those kind of things will be available. Available. All right. Yeah. Perfect. Great.
Engin Terzi: Malakis TV, can you ask John if he thinks Denis is already in the top five as of now, even though he has not proved much yet? Yeah, probably. I mean, just from- Artem you following him? His videos, are you following? Did you follow the last two with the Dadikian? Normally, Dadikian was taking him here because Denis is training every day, it's so tough. Right. And Dadikian-
John Brzenk: You don't know what to believe and what not to believe. I mean, it could be just for, you know, to get in Devon's head. You know, so it's hard to say. I mean, they're really going full out. The last one I saw was maybe not with that account, but when Alexi was pulling, I guess Alexi's back up there and training with him.
John Brzenk: And yeah, I mean, Denis looks really good. I don't, I just don't know. Denis still pulls kind of, well, it's his style, but it's sloppy. And he just doesn't have the cup, I think, to turn around.
John Brzenk: Yeah, yeah, yeah. This way. He's got he's going to stay this way. And I just can't imagine anybody beating Devon if he's, you know, they're still this way. And then his lack of being able to shoulder roll or press with a tricep, you know, he always stays outside. Well, I guess I don't see him, no matter how strong he gets, being able to overcome. You are saying that Devon is going to win. The leverage advantage that Devon is going to be able to take on him is going to be tremendous.
John Brzenk: Denis also has great endurance, but you're going up against the guy that's probably, you know, the best endurance in the game. So I don't see Devon, you know, wearing out as far as the endurance game goes either. So, um,
John Brzenk: Denis is going to have to be strong enough not only to maintain his hand and wrist, but also cup it and then roll. He cannot cup. He cannot cup. He doesn't do it. He doesn't do it. But they both will be like this. But what if Devon also has this because of Denis's…
John Brzenk: Devon is very comfortable pulling like that. You mean like moving his wrist like this? Yeah, almost a little bit of a king's move. He still keeps his knuckles high even if his wrist is bent back. And he's fighting and he's got great endurance and great power there. Do you think that Denis' arm may be opening? It might be a little stronger, but I don't think it's strong enough to beat Denis.
John Brzenk: beat Devon. I think the guy that could possibly beat Devon is going to have to be super explosive and beat him right away to the pad and control his wrist and turn his wrist up. And Denis doesn't have that. I mean, the only guy that could possibly do it or that has done it is LeVon, right? But that's what I'm saying. That's the kind of guy, maybe LeLayton could do it if he really committed to saying hi with Devon and then really be able to come up and get that position. But
Engin Terzi: Boy, yeah, I don't see any way for Denis to win this thing. Okay. Kevin Tom K. Hi, legends. What is more valued or harder title, win or prestige title? A WAF title or Zloty title? Is Nemerov and Zloty the same thing? Yeah, Nemerov and Zloty are the same thing. One was the, it is called amateur title. This is WAF.
Engin Terzi: was with a doping test and zloty tour is a was a professional one and with no tests the professional ones as of now still don't have it we should have it um i don't know what john thinks yeah i mean if it can be done it can be afforded i heard talks that um another league was gonna possibly you know do that uh the testing part of it as far as what's a better or tougher title
John Brzenk: Um, you know, WAF is definitely a lot deeper. I mean, you have to navigate a lot of, just a lot of matches, even if the competition isn't as good. Um, and they're very strict at WAF. So you have to really know what the hell you're doing, or you can easily be fouled out at home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Very, very, very sick. Very, very, very sick. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, let's see. But do you agree that there has been no time in the history of armwrestling
Engin Terzi: Like today that like almost all the top pullers are involved in the same league and pulling regularly with the rankings. Like today, you know, every one and a half months, you know, there is like 10, 15 matches, King of the table over here, you know, and then more and more in the past, the rankings were like 20% based on the results and the 80% of, I think this way, you know, right now, like less, oh, I think this way.
John Brzenk: more based on the the results that we are regularly you know yeah no it's uh i i mean i i was a little critical of the super match format uh you know seven eight nine ten years ago but um i mean it's it's worked out to be you know the way right i mean nobody's doing open double elimination tournaments hardly anymore um it's way more exciting um
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I mean, it gives guys a chance to really train and challenge themselves in the rankings and everything. Yeah, it's definitely a good time for arm wrestling. Yeah, I mean, like boxing, MMA, when you go to their roots, amateur weight, you will see tournaments in the boxing as well, in the Olympics, in the World Championship, all tournaments. But when it comes to the professional,
Engin Terzi: level then we see them one on one you know in just like like you don't see boxing tournament with tyson and louise and this and this compete you know one match can be tougher than the other one you know and then you know it's just that is right and that endurance factor has been fun i mean it definitely has changed has changed the sport up quite a bit to have to be and not only just super powerful um but also you know have that endurance so
Engin Terzi: We will see. We will see how it will go, but it looks like this is going to be getting better and better. You got a hell of a lot of medals behind you, Inge. Wow, you won a lot of stuff. Come on. I mean, probably a quarter of yours. How long has it been? 40 years?
Engin Terzi: Oh, I started when I was in pro tournaments when I was about 18. Yeah, so 41 years now. 41 years. Mine is around, first one to now is 31 years. Yeah. Yeah, it was my first national championships. I took second. I was 18, yeah. And, yeah.
Engin Terzi: mine is 31 years yours is and there is 10 years between us so it's normal you know let's see if i can be if i will be able to arm muscle when i come to uh late 50s but i don't think so but this is very very hard to organize this event yeah if if mentally you still want to do it you're going to be able to do it again i truly believe that the mental part is the the tough part is trying to figure out how to negotiate all the
John Brzenk: little aches and pains you didn't used to have, you know, but once you've come to terms to come to terms with with that stuff and and just, you know, forward your head.
Engin Terzi: You know, the problem is that like, like every time this event lasts for five days, I am having like a few hours sleep every night because like, like early and I was late. It's just another challenging and you're going to have to deal with it. You want to compete? I'm not strong enough. I used to like one time I traveled from Vancouver to Missouri, like six to eight hours by bus. If you just put me on bus for 10 hours now, I would be like this. You understand?
Engin Terzi: So what I'm just saying, the more I get exhausted, you know, damaged, older, just body cannot handle. See, last few days I had stomach pain and then I could sleep, I slept very bad. See, yesterday I didn't have stomach pain.
Engin Terzi: pain so I slept like 15 hours my body needed yesterday my end was like so like light now I feel here like rock again you know those those muscles and everything you know so once you are you get good rest you are becoming a little bit different the sleep is I think that cannot be replaced by any other thing you know with nothing you know just sleep is very important how is your sleep can you sleep good
John Brzenk: I still sleep like a baby. To be honest, the weight loss has definitely made me more energetic. I could sleep 12 hours and be tired in a couple hours and go take a nap and sleep the rest of the day. But with the weight loss, I definitely feel more energetic. And it gets a little tougher to sleep at night when it's time to go to bed. I think, oh.
Engin Terzi: normally don't lay here for an hour thinking about fall asleep but yeah so it's definitely changed my energy level a little bit yeah let's talk about some of the matches uh like rustam babaev and iraqli you have pulled both gentlemen uh rustam many years ago and iraqli recently and iraq team losing
Engin Terzi: But he did very well against the hook pullers like Krasimir and Lachlan, you know.
Engin Terzi: and makaro but he lost his wrist against you he lost his wrist against ongar and recently too i think daddy kian also didn't he didn't have the hand control but rushtam is he can go rushtam can also go outside but rushtam is mainly going inside and even though you took his wrist like we know that iraq his arm is not weak you know he's uh so how do you see this match yeah uh
John Brzenk: know rustam's a special guy he doesn't he doesn't rely on his hand strength to be able to make that hook he uses his back and his tricep to to stay high and then come just almost come down with the you know downward forces of the wrist so it's going to be uh kind of about timing and rustam has been super effective to being able to do that to you know the very top top top so i think directly is going to be um
John Brzenk: have a tough time. Not saying that he can't win, but I think if Rustam's in really good shape and he's back to healthy form, that he's going to be a good match. Boy, if it goes inside, if Rustam hits it wrist to wrist, then it's, you know, in my opinion, it might go down really quick, right? So, directly he's going to have to
John Brzenk: not be fooled by the setup of rustum um not be fooled by what feels like a top roll and just be very conscious of you know still going back hard um you know getting getting that getting that wrist away from rustum because um he can definitely come crashing down on that wrist so you are saying that you are saying that rushtam has the edge or
John Brzenk: i'll let you know i'll let you know after i see rustam i mean if he like i said if he's healthy and in good shape i mean the last time we saw him uh when he pulled paul in um he was you know not looking like the guy that i saw in meldova so uh yeah i mean we'll see what kind of shape he comes in at but uh
John Brzenk: Yeah, so that's that. What is that? Is there a cap? Is there an 8695? Your future openness? Right, another reason to stay out of the class. 105 is easier. Yeah, well, it is for me, because it's a more natural way. I mean, I can actually go in and be, you know, not be like, completely, you know,
John Brzenk: Well, King of the Table said I was 5'11". I'm not 5'11", guys. I'm 6'2". Let's watch that rumor that I'm 5'11". It's not easy for me to make 95 kilos. Yeah. Artem you...
Engin Terzi: Were you taller than 6'2 when you were younger or you were 6'2? Because when we get older, we get a little bit shorter, a little bit. Yeah, of course. Maybe 6'1 now or still 6'2. You measured? I don't know. I haven't officially measured to see exactly where I'm at, but I can't imagine...
John Brzenk: losing that much. 5'11 is Todd Hutchings. I don't know, but even a full inch is a lot. I mean, my discs, I know, are compressed a little bit. I've had back surgery because of compressed discs, so I've probably lost a tiny bit of height, but I can't imagine it being a whole inch, so I'm probably still fairly close to my normal, original height. Yeah, yeah. So you are saying that Rustam has the edge, Todd has the edge,
John Brzenk: Devon has the edge, correct? Yes. Yeah. And how about Sasho versus John? Boy, I don't know. Yeah, I've been trying to rehab my side pressure, my shoulder. I'm trying to be a little bit more aggressive off the go. Quick question, quick question. Sorry for cutting you. How is your shoulder after the recent different type of therapies? You feeling any better? A little bit, maybe.
John Brzenk: I mean, I felt okay. Yeah, I mean, it's a more of a mental thing. I mean, if I prepare myself correctly with the painkillers and do all the things I need to do to try to to to mask that it still pops and still cracks and I still I still rule it every day and it goes thinking that it's gonna eventually heal what I'm probably just aggravating it. But yeah, no, if I can
John Brzenk: I can't afford to do what I did with Todd and feel like I could outlast him by toppling his hand. I think I need to be more aggressive like I pulled Zurab and have that aggressiveness to my side of the table and get him stretched out a little bit. And if I can do that,
John Brzenk: I think I got good chances. If he ends up keeping me center or taking me off center and I got to fight to take his hand and try to outlast him, the way he's built, the way his structure is, I imagine he's going to be similar to my match with Todd Hutchings and it'll be a very difficult day for me. But we'll see. Maybe I'll surprise myself and my endurance will be a little bit better being
John Brzenk: 20, 30 pounds lighter. But, um, yeah, I, you know, I'm excited. It's not going to be easy. Um, I'm looking forward to it. Yeah. Usually, usually, um, when Sasho loses, he is losing on or his pronator. Yeah.
John Brzenk: So, and I haven't done that very often. I've been staying outside and just pronating myself until their hand completely blows up. And that won't be a tactic that works very well against him. I see him still staying tight and having that side pressure like Mr. Hutchings does. And so it doesn't end well for me if that's what happens. So I need to be aggressive. I need to have my cup.
John Brzenk: I need to be able to turn his hand upright and be aggressive off the start and not let it get into a long match. The way he's built, he's going to have better endurance and be able to outlast me if the match stops. Anyways, we will see. Very soon we will find out. This will be your last training today? Yeah, I think so. I'm going to do a little...
John Brzenk: maybe like a warmup little, uh, photo session probably next week. I told you, um, uh, men's health is coming out, um, to do a little article and, uh, they were saying they were actually going to come to the practice today, but then they, uh, decided that it was going to be a little too short notice and difficult. So then we're going to come to the house in, uh, in Arizona next week. So I'll do probably a little bit of stuff next weekend, but just super, super light. Uh, but yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Today. Today.
John Brzenk: Today will be a hard practice. I don't want to overdo it. I mean, there's going to be guys there like Todd that I'm going to try to not really get in his way too much. I'm sure those guys know that you are going into like a big match and I'm sure that they will just be there just to give you training. Yeah, well, they're preparing also. So it's going to be everybody's going to be wanting to do their best to prepare. They have a short term
Engin Terzi: match coming up there? Well, well, Hutch Hutchings. I mean, no, no, no. I'm not talking about Hutchings. I'm not talking about the guys that don't have any short matches. You know, I mean, this is how we do over here. You know, if the guy has a match, we do table training. I give him the training.
John Brzenk: If I have a match, the guy gives me the training because I am the one who needs to be ready. Not for ego satisfaction. It's easy to say it's hard once you start getting into battle, especially with guys like Hutchings and Mr. Ron Bassett. Well, Ron's a little bit easier going and slower. I can kind of pace myself and not feel like I'm going to get one of them.
John Brzenk: breathe in hits like todd occasionally i always have to be careful with him because you know he can all out of the blue just come up with some little movement or or hit an aggressive thing and like oh oh that hurt how many how many table times did you have after i actually match one
John Brzenk: uh yeah just once a week after the match i well no i pulled last weekend too so two matches i i did like a little warm-up the week after um not nothing very hard and then i i went back home last how was last week last week experience how was it because i felt okay um you know the guys felt stronger for sure than before i left the pool alexi but uh um yeah it wasn't too bad it wasn't horribly bad so
John Brzenk: I understand. So I'm just trying to calculate. Do you think that from now on, because of you getting used to, you will be even feeling stronger and stronger? That was my plan. That's, that's the reason I kind of had the rush. I didn't really do it a slow cut. Um, I decided that I was going to try to, you know, cause I have better, um,
John Brzenk: results with doing almost a fasting if i try to just cut my calories just a little bit i'm always thinking about food i'm always hungry where if i kind of starve myself and let myself get past that point of no hunger pains anymore i'm i it's easier for me to not eat uh and so that was my plan to try to cut as hard as and fast as i could to get yeah near near the proper weight and then try to
Engin Terzi: Get used to them for a couple of weeks. Smart plants. And today, if you don't feel so good, then you are going to eat some carbo. So you will be a little bit feeling stronger, and then you're going to make 220. But if you feel good, then you may cut it. This is what I understand from what you're saying. Yeah, I might try to play the water cut game just to see this week when I get home to see how it does. How it does?
John Brzenk: Yeah, I'll try to flood myself with water on Monday, Tuesday, and then see Wednesday, Thursday, and no water and see exactly what kind of results I'm going to get out of that. So I don't want to keep the calorie deficit and then realize coming up close to the mass that it's just not going to work out to make that water cut. So I'll do maybe a little test bed. Mm-hmm.
Engin Terzi: Kevin Tom K is asking, saying, I think Sasho Andreev is the best pound-for-pound arm master in the world. I put him above Prokopchuk even. However, I will always cheer for God Brzenk. Thank you, sir. Yeah, no, I agree with you. I mean, he's proven himself to be quite a formidable powerhouse. So, yeah, I'm excited.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I mean, Sasho is for sure one of the best, but he didn't have losses like he... Like recently, I mean, when I say recently, right before the pandemic, I have seen him like 2019, he lost to... He lost to... As far as I remember, he lost to Zolev...
Engin Terzi: And not the other brother Zolev, Spartak Zolev. And then he lost to the same year in the World Championships. He lost, I think, no, he lost to Spartak Zolev and Sasho, I think. Also, he lost to Zolev, Ajumra. So in that year, I think with right arm, he has like two losses, three losses, as far as I remember. Of course, he is for sure one of the best, but not like untouchable, untouchable, you know.
Engin Terzi: But he has defeated Ongarbaev in one of the events in Croatia, but maybe it was 2018 or something. It was not the same Ongarbaev. What do you think about Ongarbaev?
John Brzenk: I mean, he's hard to get through. He's strong enough to not be able to beat unless you have total control of his hand and wrist. And that's the difficult feat, right? I mean, you have to beat his hand and wrist and then you can beat his arm. But without your hand and wrist, you're typically not going to
John Brzenk: be able to overpower him. He's that strong to be able to stay in the game, and he's proven that he's got great endurance, so he can wear almost 99% of the people out. Will he be able to outlast someone like Devon? I just don't think he's going to be on the same power level as someone like Devon, so I think he would definitely be the underdog in that match. It doesn't matter even if the match is at 231?
John Brzenk: I think, well, the latest videos I've seen of Devon, he almost looks like he's getting down to 230, 240. He's looking lean. So I don't know what his thought process is or what his idea is going into the Denis match. But yeah, I don't think Devon's going to lose a ton of strength by losing the weight. I mean,
John Brzenk: What I felt from him recently, it's, you know, and it just, it shows in how he's able to train. It's really not about the muscle and the water anymore. It's his tendons have just gotten just ridiculously strong. So he can just hang out and hang out and hang out. Um, it, it doesn't seem to wear on him. So I can't imagine, um, a big weight loss really affecting him too much. Hmm.
Engin Terzi: okay this guy just victor is asking does john think he can be double champion 95 and 105 within six months oh well depends on who the 105 champion is um i definitely would love to pull directly again i would definitely love to pull
John Brzenk: uh, uh, criticality if I'm going to buy a beats, Mr. Todd Hutchings, which I don't think is going to happen. Um, I think, I think I could, I think I could do something with criticality. I think I have a good chance to maybe achieve that one Oh five title. If he's the, if he's the current champ still, um, if it's Todd, I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to do some more rehab and figure some stuff out. And, um, I'll definitely be the underdog going in. Uh, but
John Brzenk: Yeah, I mean, it's possible, I guess. But double champion, 95 and 105? Well, it just depends on how it works. I mean, if I cut to 95 and then have four or five months to gain back up to 105, then, I mean, obviously, yeah, for sure. But if you're asking me if I could be 105 champion weighing 95, no, that's not going to happen. No, no, no. Why would you do that? I think that even before the match, you will be 225 minimum, and then you will gain some weight.
Engin Terzi: I mean, I'm telling you, if Friday you make 209, I'm sure Saturday evening you will be 225 already. And then if your match is three months later, you will be 235 in no time, you know? Yes, yeah, of course. Anyway, so you are, okay, Zaur is pulling Georgi Tsvetkov. Yeah.
John Brzenk: Zaur's all healed up. His bicep injury is healed. I haven't seen any recent footage of him pulling or training since his injury, but boy, I can't even hardly speculate on those big guys. Corgi or Georgi or whatever his name is, big guy. He's obviously very difficult to get a hold of. He's such a huge arm, similar to Lamont. The size just makes it difficult, but
John Brzenk: Zahra, I mean, if he's healthy, he's shown that he's got tremendous power. I mean, he's able to, you know, in the last practice session before he got hurt, you know, be able to control Denis like that and just bring him right to the pad. And he was like two days or one day after he pulled the AMC event. He pulled, then he went there and then pulled Denis the next day or two days later or something, you know. Right.
John Brzenk: Yeah, but Denis wasn't the Denis right now, you know. Right. Well, that's, yeah, you would think that, but I mean, it's still very impressive. So I would have to give him the edge. I would think that he's going to be the guy, if I was going to just bet blindly, thinking that he's going to be the favorite. I mean, what's your feelings? Oh, you're not, you're not, you're running the tournament, so you're not going to. No, I'm not. I'm not. Whenever I say something, see?
Engin Terzi: He's holding the guy's side. I hate too many haters, you know, so I'd rather not say. It is very, very unfortunate because I kind of consider myself one of those authorities that have good opinion, but like the community. I'm so critical against, you know, critical of guys that
John Brzenk: are experts or so-called experts based on what they see versus real-time experience so it's really difficult for me to also say you know oh this guy this guy is better than this guy right you know because all i'm going by is the footage that i see i mean i have no real you know concrete real life data to yeah to have an opinion so um i'm i'm careful that to not
John Brzenk: be that guy like oh yeah this guy he's gonna oh he's gonna kill or he's gonna dominate just based on you know what i've seen on youtube or the internet you know it's yeah yeah just never been at that table never been at that level like yeah
Engin Terzi: like three four decades the guy comes oh you know nothing you know right you're the expert from watching videos from your from your uh your closet your hotel room right yeah from my grandmother's basement you know i'm i became the the the biggest expert but what to do you know it's the reality we need to we need to uh handle but this is just like the youtubers are most of them are the same you know just because of
Engin Terzi: boys and you know and then acting like he knows a lot you know things like that but so what to do you know it's just like unfortunately or i should say maybe you unfortunately the reality you know yeah and anyways john so we have kept you for 45 minutes soon you will have you will have your guests knocking your door yep he should be here any minute yeah i was hoping he'd show up a little bit early we could you could crash the podcast but
Engin Terzi: I haven't seen him or heard from him yet. Yeah, I wish you safe training. I hope you will feel good. And if you make 95, it's great. If you don't make, it's still great. I'm telling you, you are bigger than world title. And I can say this only for you on this. Yeah, John Bersink is like bigger than world title. You cannot ask him how many titles. He doesn't really care. You know, he...
Engin Terzi: he beat world champions more than anyone else. You know, they were just going and winning the world title and you were pulling and beating them. So, so you were just saying that this is, I am, I am bigger title. Yeah. Well, like I said, I'm, I'm also very practical as far as, you know, the professional aspect of just, you know, the,
John Brzenk: It's my, it's my side hustle. So I also have that consideration, you know, I have that consideration of, well, what's, you know, what's the best thing for me to do approach. And it's obviously, obviously easier for me to maybe win this thing, uh, you know, being a little heavier than, than,
Engin Terzi: just challenging myself to you know some crazy thing just to have a title so yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean i mean your title is good but just something else needs to come with it you know so that like this is this is this is the most normal thing you know like about the professional you know profession as far as i know english is not my uh mother language but professional is coming from profession right you make living with it right right right right yeah so you need to really
Engin Terzi: really to call it professional you know you really need to be making good money especially if you are the best it needs to that that is like very very understandable normal thing you know when we were young we all had we were ideal idealistic we were just like i want to win there win there win after a point you write everything you just okay now different levels yeah now business yeah i have a family to take care anyway so thank you very much john
John Brzenk: and have a great flight and see you here thursday thursday yeah 5 p.m okay yeah um yeah hopefully uh we'll get some footage out maybe today i'm sure someone will have a camera and we'll be able to yeah yeah yeah a little bit of the practice session yeah it would be good it won't be me because i'm too lazy to start someone to do this send me i will put on the on the social media okay okay sounds good okay all right thanks thank you thank you see you soon
Engin Terzi: See you. Bye-bye. Okay, guys, maybe 10, 15 minutes we also chat together. Let's see if anything else.

Engin Terzi: But this is how it is normally. Whenever I chat like this, I try to talk with everyone, you know, about every, but whenever I have the guests, I need to more focus on the guests. And then if there is a super chat because of the, you know, the rules and everything, you know, ethically, you know, I have to answer. So it's not because I only answer the super chats. You know, whenever I do alone, I try to answer almost everything, you know.
Engin Terzi: If you buy East vs West 10 t-shirt, Jerry, you will receive it after Atlas comes, they sign, event finish, we come home and then we ship to you. But it is not possible to ship all of them at once from our side. So, no, Isaac.

Engin Terzi: You are welcome, Belmonti. Thank you for your support. Yeah, yeah. John Bersink was our guest for about 45 minutes and he left. Okay, guys. I also a little bit feel dizzy.
Engin Terzi: And because of my accident, you know, just better just rest now. So tomorrow I have another podcast with Tatasins and Ongarbaev. So thank you for being. No, Ongarbaev cannot speak English, but we will try to find someone to help us. You all take care, guys.
