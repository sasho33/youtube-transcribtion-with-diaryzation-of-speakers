Engin Terzi: You and I, we will be close friends and you will become a Lilia. I don't think that becoming a close friend with me will make you Lilia. It's all up to your hard work, your genetics, your intelligence, understanding all the sports.
Engin Terzi: hello to Portugal I will never get anything from my hello to Italy Mustang I already explained you know hours ago I wrote on the

Engin Terzi: Hello, Gabrielle. Hello to Germany. Hello to India Preet. Hello, Michael. I'm also excited. I love it. Just don't think that I'm being prideful or something. It has nothing to do with me, but we all together do all this, and it really makes me so excited that every one and a half, two months, we are having these kind of events, and then
Engin Terzi: regular base we see how you know good those athletes are you know if you are in your prime will you want to to topple no Devon is too big I have no doubt in my mind that if we were similar size I would beat him but but the guy is just so big it's impossible
Engin Terzi: the guy is near 2 meters he is ripped under 20-25 kilo just totally ripped you know while I am fat 90 kilo if I would be as ripped as him you know I would be maximum 75 kilo so he's probably like 45 kilo muscle mass just much taller just a giant guy there is everyone is their limits hello Suman
Engin Terzi: Tolzen Olex Lovechild, hello your chest looks strong I mean I'm training everything you know I'm training everything I will only get better because before I wasn't motivated to train now I'm training non-stop training non-stop when I said non-stop like like on the days that I should train I'm not missing training hello Tomber hello to England
Engin Terzi: You think Devon is willing to face Vital anytime soon? He isn't seem to call him out. I mean, why would Devon call him Alan? You know, just the guy is the champion and he is set to pull against Denis. Devon's goal is to take care what he promised to take care.
Engin Terzi: will be pulling anyone I don't think like just guys remember like before you call in Devon like he is afraid of this he is afraid of that I mean there is no one that to be more afraid from you know than Levan this guy pulled Levan and I'm sure he's willing to pull Levan again you know for one year two years we all thought that he was scared of Hermes he just came and pulled him you know so it was like before I'm not saying Alain you are saying that he's scared or something but
Engin Terzi: know the guy is just pulling you know i think he's the most active puller as of now just how many guys did he pull he pull like in last 10 months let's let's count he pulled prudnik and then he pulled
Engin Terzi: and then he pulled Hermes. So in, what's that, 10 months, he pulled five supermatches. I'm not even counting the left-arm ones. With the left-arm ones, he pulled also, I think, Sandri's left arm, and then Jordan Sonev's left arm, and then Kalinichenko's left arm, and recently he pulled Georgi Tsvetkov's left arm. So the guy is just the most active, you know.
Engin Terzi: Like, one may like him, may not like him. You know, just this is what it is. The fact is fact. Hello, Barcelona. Hello, Tonga. Hello to United Kingdom. Hello, Benger. Hello, greetings to Germany. Yeah, Brian Travis is dangerous for anyone if he's just ready.
Engin Terzi: Greetings to Denmark, Christopher. I'm sorry if I miss anything. Luka Engin, make a great job for the sport. Thank you. Thank you. Just remember, we do this all together. Without your support, I cannot do anything. Hello. Hello to India.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I mean, for me, the best version of John was 2006, my friends. Yeah. Just, just, guys, just be patient. Yes, Adnan. Yes, big arm wrestling family. Just be patient. And X1348, good morning, Engin. Blink once if Devon won.
Engin Terzi: Or blink twice for Georgi. I'm joking. My friend, they did not actually tell me. I asked Neil. I asked Devon. I asked Georgi. They all said that. Engin, we cannot tell. And I said, even to me, they said, yeah, we cannot tell. But from the way that they behaved, they gave me some ideas about who is winning.
Engin Terzi: Hello, Michael Workspace. They gave me some ideas about who won. I kind of guess, can guess. Akimbo just reached me recently, my friend. Both Oleg Cherkasov tested positive. I feel really sorry. The guy is just... Thank you, Trey. The guy is just like a legend. He made a mistake. He took a medicine.
Engin Terzi: alaykum salam Saud and Denis and then he was provided medicine it is not it has nothing to do with the like a steroid or something it's just like a vertigo medicine that makes your mind you know together you know and the guy probably didn't know and that not to use in fact I also experienced vertigo
Engin Terzi: What is that? Like some months ago, like just say like what, four months ago or something? I don't exactly remember. And I also use the same exact medicine because you cannot even stand, you know. And so he's now technically tested positive for the doping test and I cannot invite him. But I really like, I mean, feel so sorry. The guy is just legend. I have huge respect for Cerkasov. Cerkasov is incredible athlete, you know.
Engin Terzi: Anna and Sarah going on today then Lopez I mean in my opinion Sarah looks favorite but both are my friends I just wish both the best hello hello to South Africa Raymond your country is one of the nicest places that I have ever seen I had been at the Kruger National Park
Engin Terzi: me there about 10 years ago it was a nice experience okay so yeah Jerry versus Vitaly would be a nice match yeah
Engin Terzi: What about doing East versus West qualifiers in Central and South America? I think we did South America last year, Gabriela did. And this year, I think there will be two of them. One will be also in Argentina. As far as I heard, these things, you know, James Reid and Pauline, they are taking care of these things. Akimbo, Akimbo also reached me.
Engin Terzi: Hakimbo reached me he said Engin can I film at your event and I said limited yeah limited way and from limited place we can talk just come you know and I said if you are also thinking to compete just let me know as well and I'm sure he will let me know if he is ready to compete as well. Hello Undergrove hello hello hello.
Engin Terzi: next match for Jerry Jerry needs to totally feel good we are in touch I just asked him how he has been doing and then Jerry's match is always ready Jerry one of our superstars I think Devon is taller than 6'5 I think he is around 6'6
Engin Terzi: And I think Vitaly is taller than 6'8", probably. I don't know. I have been training. Thank you, Mr. Matrix. I'm not the real god of arm wrestling. The only one god is John Brzenk, and it's by far. And salute to Canada.
Engin Terzi: Thank you, my friend. Thank you. I hope you are well too. Arsene Lille will be coming as a special guest. I have been trying to convince Arsene Lille to compete East versus West. But he was ready. He was going to get ready after the war started. And then he lost his own because he was reserved. He was...
Engin Terzi: there was a possibility him to be called to the army. So, and now, like, I cannot convince him anymore. He's like, you know, sometimes come close there, he's like, Engin, like, trust my word that if I ever come back, it will be to you, you know, you will be the first person and I will come to your event. And, but so what I did, I have been using my,
Engin Terzi: political experience so what I did just call him and I would say this to his face as well not behind that I said come here as a special guest and he said yes so my hope is him to come here as a special guest and then be inspired and then go home and start training so that is but it's not the reason like even when he was gonna compete then I also invited him many times as a special guest
Engin Terzi: Arsene and I we have been friends for a long time you know um so showing in how many percent is one I I use my own stem cells you know from the belly fat so I help some and but not not super like um it is an innocent strategy innocent strategy and
Engin Terzi: i don't know my friend i don't know yeah pauline is incredible what is the status about what at the moment what do you mean my friends uh school boy i i offered him a match against uh bacho but his brother said that they have they were doing something you know around these times you know
Engin Terzi: Gabriel, I already, I mean, Travis was coming already. I didn't like stop working with Travis. Travis's son was gonna play, he played, you know, already for Chicago Bears, you know, his first match. This is what I was told. And that was his first professional match, as far as I understand. I don't know much about American football. And Travis wanted to be with his son on the same date, so
Engin Terzi: It was very understandable, you know. Yeah. My friend, vertigo medicine help. Yeah. But my type of vertigo was like about like sudden getting up from the bed, you know. So I had to put those crystals back. There are some type of exercise. So I did them. Yeah. All together, it was good. I need to be careful when I get up.
Engin Terzi: from the bed you know hello MCS God bless you and respect from Switzerland hello to Switzerland I don't know why I'm doing that I'm going back on the chat I don't know I can do something special yeah I should do something I'm incredible I think East versus West five six and the last one they were very good yeah
Engin Terzi: think six was very good too six was so good that at the end there was no adrenaline left you know even though it was a so close match jerry versus georgia match like we were like thank you guys uh michael thomas versus west 10 in which category i know michael todd is coming here for comment commentating yeah
Engin Terzi: Your competition? I hope so. I hope Voivode will compete next year, my friend. We are talking about it, but it's totally up to the athletes.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I'm also happy to see Alexey Voivoda. BKC Artem, if the East versus West champion lost in King of the Table, will he lose only the King of the Table belt? I don't think King of the Table has belt or league, but also these, we are talking with Devon Idris. We are talking about this. We are talking and then we will finalize something.
Engin Terzi: There are a few matches that he needs to pass, but I think that it should be a great match. I haven't decided if I should go. I want to go to Dubai. My friend,
Engin Terzi: I don't share my opinion about the matches that I'm organizing, but it is a very good match. It could go either way. I can see Devon winning that match. I can also see Denis winning that match. We will see. Second round of Devon versus Ermes. Yeah, that is...
Engin Terzi: I don't know what you are exactly asking, but I want to tell you guys something. When Hermes took, Levan took Hermes' wrist, he was like this and hanging on Brachii radialis. When Devon took Hermes' wrist, later he also did this cupping and cut this connection, so Hermes couldn't really press so much. He was putting pressure here as well.
Engin Terzi: and yeah looks like i mean we planned it travis is gonna come yeah i mean it can be maybe 2009 shape maybe earlier shape victor i don't i don't exactly know but 2006 was like a machine you know
Engin Terzi: Tournament format, I don't know, my friend, East versus West. I talked one time about it with John, and John said, John is thinking that, yeah, I'm getting ready, Team Turner. I'm getting ready. I don't know where I can reach. I don't know what level I should pull. Should I just go a title match on November 11th, or I should just, I don't know, pull someone a little bit,
Engin Terzi: Like, below that level? I don't know. I think the September training will tell me. I don't think Reno and Levan is comparable. Reno is like his hand and everything, and then Levan, that... I'll say the structure is different. It's not about your weight, but...
Engin Terzi: Gennady will return whenever his bicep is healed up, he had a surgery. I think Derek should go a little bit lower level opponent slowly.
Engin Terzi: Um, I think Nur Dalet will not be defending his title in November, but probably something in January because there is World Combat Games at the end of October. And... I don't know who's winning. Sadie Sorino. Um...
Engin Terzi: I don't think Denis said that. When did Denis say that he doesn't see Devon causing a problem? I don't know. I did the interview. He didn't say such thing as far as I remember. Yeah. Denis versus Hermes would be a good match, yeah? Why Voivoda will fight with Birzing? Because the match is set. The match is set that way. When the organizer asks two athletes and
Engin Terzi: Thank you T-Rex. Thank you. Hi Engin. Hi Engin. Can you get Travis Bergen to commentate on upcoming cars? He is a good speaker, helps to match and talks about a lot of interesting things. My friend.
Engin Terzi: Like, I always get Travis. There is no time that after once he started, he always came. On the last event, his son was going to have his professional match with Chicago Bears. And Travis wanted to be with his son. And then I said, okay, Travis. It was understandable. And then that's what it is, you know. Like, Travis is coming. Did he say he's not coming or something? I don't know. Then it sounded like, don't give me
Engin Terzi: Denis knows how serious opponent he is. I mean, I'm sure Denis is very smart guy. And I have no doubt that he knows how dangerous. If anyone saw Devon versus Ermes match and not taking Devon seriously, that cannot be a smart person. And trust me, Denis is a smart person.
Engin Terzi: yeah the part that I don't understand how people like how people like thought that you know he was uh small Devon was small like whenever you saw him like how big he is um like when he was making his speech like I mean like how can you think he's
Engin Terzi: Look at the shoulders. Do you see how wide the shoulders and everything is? Long ago, we tried to have a match right-handed for decades. It's been... Some people even thought that my arms were bigger than his, but it's not true. Clerks, I have plans, like...
Engin Terzi: and whatever the plan is uh decided you know just results you won't be um you won't be disappointed you know of course Ivan will compete again like guys I will tell you something uh you believe or not I am more of an arm wrestling fan than any of you out there trust me and this has been like
Engin Terzi: organize an event I'm just making my dreams come true you know whenever I said this matches you know so of course there are some other things I am also like other things I also consider when I'm making this event you know there are some East vs West qualifications at that's coming from there because we cannot be just like elite elite you know and then no connection with the rest of the
Engin Terzi: everywhere, you know, and then, then, um, so, um, Bill Collins and I, we talk, um, and Bill Collins and I, we agreed, but then, I mean, the last message he didn't answer. He wrote me if the crew is ready. I said, yes, as we agreed, but maybe I need to, um, check with him again, but Luke cannot come. Luke said that he is committed to something else on the same exact date.
Engin Terzi: know and then so so look won't be there I just talked with Barbara Barbara
Engin Terzi: And I offered her a match for January, and she accepted. And she asked me what matches we will have at the East versus West 10. And I told her all the matches that are finalized, and she was just so happy. She was like, yeah, she's one of our superstars.
Engin Terzi: um why michael workspace why was devon was so mad with dennis in his last video in last video i don't think he was so mad like previous some a few before you know it was because dennis called him a clown you know last video last video i don't know i didn't see another video the only video i saw
Engin Terzi: He was saying that go to his channel and tell him that it is not 2018 anymore. Did he post anything else again? I don't think he posted anything. No, march toward death. I didn't see any anger there. Not with the previous one either. I don't know which video. You need to ask Hermes.
Engin Terzi: We will see my friend, we will see everything. Cyprus, Adem Erdogan, Cyprus, Cyprus. Do you want to say Cyprus, brother? I came to Cyprus before, I came in 2012. Thank you, brother, you can.
Engin Terzi: We can do it. Oh, Cyprus. Yes, I came in 2012. Wonderful. My home country. Greetings to everyone. Greetings to our brothers in Cyprus.
Engin Terzi: Travis, I think, training Andriy Volkov. I think he's training. And... He's getting ready. He's getting ready. We will see. We will see. Davit versus Ongarbaev, great match. But for now, we set Tatachins versus Ongarbaev. But all these matches will be set, my friend. All of them. All these matches. All you need to do is just...
Engin Terzi: watch the next one support and enjoy have fun and then the next one next one and next one as i said we will be providing all these matches for you guys as long as you guys support us we will be doing this
Engin Terzi: No, my injuries are big injuries, my friend, chronic injuries. Joshua Weeks, Vitaly versus Morozov. Yeah, I invited that, but Morozov first needs to get back to his health 100%. I just wrote to him two days ago or something, and I said,
Engin Terzi: don't do anything until you are 100% healthy. Yeah, I mean, if this event came to this point, it is because of those people who supported us with pay-per-view, with the merchandise, you know, this is how it is growing, you know.
Engin Terzi: Justin, where would you put Adon's current level? Adon has a long way to go, but he has good potential, and the most important is he is in safe hands, and he is in very knowledgeable hands, and also the most important, he has desire. He has desire. Mask, last pay-per-view? Yes, it was successful.
Engin Terzi: Michael workspace very excited to see Zaur versus Georgi thanks Engin yeah thank you thank you for your support my friend um as you guys like understand that like the reason that we are doing this we are trying to bring to your attention uh many of the Atlas whoever is giving hopes on this Earth
Engin Terzi: We are doing our best to bring that to this stage, to your attention. In the past, they were saying, you should focus on a few guys. Why are you spending money for the other matches? Why are you spending? Just focus on a few guys. We cannot grow the sport that way. We need to give opportunity to everyone who has desire and who has potential to become the next superstar.
Engin Terzi: Like, we cannot do that. We need to involve as many. And then you will have a lot of arm masters to become the fan of. You don't need to wait two months, my friend. This 23rd of September, the return of Alexey Voivoda, for me, is a very, very, very important match. Very important. Alexey Voivoda versus John Bersink is incredible, you know.
Engin Terzi: If John wins, it's incredible. If Alexi wins, still incredible. It will also show that, you know, Alexi can reach to higher levels, you know.
Engin Terzi: No, Ongarbaev vs. Hutchings, my friends, is set for the East vs. West 10. Originally, it was like Sasho, it looked like Sasho, Hutchings, yes. But if you guys remember, if you go back to last East vs. West 7, Ongarbaev vs. Tata Hutchings match was set...
Engin Terzi: if you guys remember and then it was cancelled because uh not cancelled but postponed or you can say cancelled it was because of um if you guys remember takashi said an accident and because of because of that accident you know um we had to cancel the the match let me try to find
Engin Terzi: um sorry for taking your time but i want to remind you guys yeah right here see east versus west seven tatachins versus this match was set but then after uh tatachins had the um accident um
Engin Terzi: Tata Shing said no matter what the result is I will set your next match 95 kilo world title match even if it is Sasho or if someone else before that beats him or like the guy is gonna pull for the 95 kilo world title you know that's my word to hello family guy to Tata Shing you know
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I asked John Brzenk. John said that it is a very dangerous match for Kidirgalı. It's a very dangerous match, yeah. Arif Artem, I think, will have surgery soon, if you think from my left hand. Yes, Timide, there are a lot of great athletes still.
Engin Terzi: why i think the dwarf is very important it's like a it is just a factory outlet factory it's just yeah um no we filmed the uh rule meeting the only the thing is that last east versus west nine
Engin Terzi: i was very very exhausted i need to really i really need like three months for every event so that i can improve the things yeah let's see let's see tatachins versus ongar where will be incredible
Engin Terzi: Devon't answer if you don't feel comfortable. While he's back, I have no idea. Why would I not be comfortable or not comfortable in my workspace, you know? I have, I mean, I have no idea. I'm not informed. Thank you for your support, chat. I have no idea. Yeah, yeah. Bacho, Bacho. Bacho, yeah, needs more time, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Vitaly will have a match. I don't know when, maybe November, maybe not. We will see. Nikolay, I think I would suggest myself and you guys that if these guys have another match, I think we should focus on them. Because...
Engin Terzi: Like, I think, like, why are we setting these matches, my friend, if we are not going to focus this? Like, I kind of feel, like, if I bring the same event, Denis, Levan, Laletin, Hermes, Vudevan, John Brzing, Ongar, everyone, I kind of feel like,
Engin Terzi: like people will how about this guy what about this guy how about this matchup like I mean why am I even setting these matches if we are not gonna focus and get excited about these matches like are we gonna like why would we get excited about something that may happen in the future while we don't even talk
Engin Terzi: that part i will never understand i think that like some people think that it is just like a like a game that we write names and like oh it would be fun you know no this is actual thing you know i understand that community is so much used to about dreaming for many years but now is different time now we are making everything come true so i would suggest people to focus
Engin Terzi: Do you know when Michael is coming back? Justin Ben, thank you for your superchat. I think Michael will be ready end of this year. I don't know if he's gonna pull or not pull, but Michael is like ready. But I don't know which level ready, which category ready. My friend, I don't know about Alonzole. Many matches would be good for him.
Engin Terzi: but Alain Zoli now um needs to be allowed to like get out of Russia first he is in military school he cannot yeah yeah Ustino defeated Tarasaitis and then Tarasaitis also defeated him and I think Ustino wasn't in the final yeah it was left arm um
Engin Terzi: Yeah, we don't enjoy the moments, yeah. We just, like, if I said, like, if there is Devon versus Denis, and then people will come and say, how about Devon versus Devon? How about Vitaly versus Devon? Okay, then, let me cancel this much and set that one. I'm sure some of you will come and say, how about Denis versus Devon, you know? That part I don't understand. No, but I don't understand that people talk more about
Engin Terzi: an imaginary match-up than what actually we have, you know?
Engin Terzi: No, my friend, I like, I mean, I hate to give up. I hate losing more than winning, you know. Maybe I should have quit it if it didn't come to the point, you know. But yes, your sport usually is quiet but constant and strong and whenever it's necessary.
Engin Terzi: Michael Walkspace, when and which city will host East vs West in North America? It's not decided, but it's going to happen. Yeah, Hutchings vs Sasho will happen in the future. By the way, in terms of ranking, Denis vs Devon does not make sense. Yes, my friend, but which ranking Jerry headed when he just suddenly came and beat Gennady and win the title?
Engin Terzi: which ranking Ongarbaev had it when he came and beat John and then got the title and still defends. He was away since top eight, only competed Asian event and that's all. He just came and won. So I don't really care about ranking if, if, if athlete has already proved himself, you know, and is smart enough experience and knowledgeable enough to, um,
Engin Terzi: bring himself back to the stage, you know. No, Steven, I don't do that. I don't do that. I don't believe that, like, requests should be something about, like...
Engin Terzi: Paul or something, you know? And I don't know how many of them are pay-per-view buyers. No, I never pulled Taras Iwakin. Taras was much heavier category. About that, I...
Engin Terzi: plan to work together with Devon to organize an event in North America. Top eight was long ago. Top eight was 2019. It was three years ago. Three years ago. So you are saying that three years of absence is not long.
Engin Terzi: on three years to be fair um i'm not sure sean hello sean good to see you my friend i don't know why notifications have stopped working for you but um i want to go to i want to go to um dubai but i haven't decided 100 yet we will see
Engin Terzi: Yes, John Bursink, I don't know. His opponent we will soon decide, you know. I and John have been in touch all the time and we will decide together. Hutchings versus Ongarbaev is happening. East versus West, 105 kilo world title, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Dimitri, with all respect to Bob Ken, does he intentionally mistranslate Denis' words? I don't think he mistranslates, but he is also adding his own opinions because he is not there as a translator. Bob Ken is very close friend of Denis and he is kind
Engin Terzi: you know he is like or like together they are together and then so he is like i cannot say exactly how to um how to um describe him but he is like a very close friend of dennis and yeah
Engin Terzi: More than 10, 15 years, yeah. You're on top of the King of the Table. You'll be great. No, no secret match for me. Is there an athlete that hasn't been here for so yet that you want most? I mean, Levan, Denis. There are many of them. Like, I am crazy about arm wrestling, so I want to see. All I care is just to see these athletes together.
Engin Terzi: I don't want them to be divided to two parts. Yeah. Topple is for smart. Joshua Weeks asks, is there any athlete that hasn't been issued yet that you want the most? Good question. Yeah, yeah. I mean, Levan, Denis. Yeah. Can you upload the full Devon Erso? You upload three rounds, three rounds in your YouTube shorts.
Engin Terzi: I don't know if he filmed all of them. I don't know if he filmed all of them in a vertical way. Yeah, Levan was already set to pull Morozov if he didn't injure his wrist. Yeah, we will have the official ranking. Yeah, we have the official ranking. We need to update. There are a lot of things that we need to do and we are doing already.
Engin Terzi: For Ali Can, you want to know who is the best challenge? Abdurrahman for 105 kilo Brudnick. If he wants to pull 115, it is Ivan Matyushenko. If he wants to pull the super, I think it is Vitaly Laletin. Yeah, Ivan versus Ali Can would be 105, 15 kilo world title match, for sure.
Engin Terzi: how last event does it it was good it was good my friend it was as expected thank you Abdulmanaf we will see in your prime you focus more table or weights more table my friend I don't think you can become a good arm master with the weights you can become strong but it will never be replacing the
Engin Terzi: table time table time is where you become a better arm master Hermes was 0-5 my friend because we agreed um that we agreed that it was gonna be five rounds Hermes didn't pull last five but he also agreed yeah so that is technically how we talk yeah um
Engin Terzi: I don't know. Get out of the road adventure travel. I don't know. These things are not as easy as you are thinking. What do you think of Larry vs Leonidas coming up soon? I think it will be a good match. I think in my opinion Larry will win because both are very strong while Larry became really good armwrestler recently.
Engin Terzi: I will tell the total roster after the or near the king of the table you know we want to why does Devon complain about the ref at the beginning of the match so much I don't know if he complained this time but I don't know
