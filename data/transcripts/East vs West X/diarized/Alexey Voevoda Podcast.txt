Host: Hello, guys. Hello again.
Engin Terzi: I see your photo only, Alexi. Can you hear me? I hear you, yes, but you need to click the button. I know, I know. No problem. How are you? Good to see you. Thank you. Thank you, man. I started a few minutes early. Normally I start...
Engin Terzi: little bit chat together with the with the viewers fans and i think it will be a few more minutes for um paulo the translator to come so how are you fine thank you thank you fine
Alexey Voevoda: yes how big yeah no it's just small small no no no it looks good yeah my weight 112 kilos just does this a lot more yes maximal 11 12. yeah yeah but your your weight that you lift very heavy
Alexey Voevoda: My lift, yes. I think I'll be stronger one hour later because my...
Alexey Voevoda: rocks not not rocks yes yes uh stay stronger stay stronger it's um the process uh uh for this process i must i must i must have one year and after uh a little little uh a little bit better for the wrestling yeah yeah yeah so one one year later you will be even stronger yeah
Alexey Voevoda: Yeah, that's good. It's automatically. It's automatically because Muscle, it's power. It's born, what is it? Born, born, born, yeah. Born, not power for 100%, maybe 80%, 100%. Oh, okay. Yes, because when I'm training arm wrestling,
Alexey Voevoda: All time, all time, much weight, all time wrestling, boxing, and I have a strong bone. I have a strong bone, yes. When I swim, I just like this, like rock. Yes. Then I stay in a bobsled. I have to make my body a little bit...
Alexey Voevoda: faster or elastic elastic maybe elastic oh yeah yes yes more static right more static yes yes yes yes more static yes more dynamic in the bobsled and i try um learn and you training programs
Alexey Voevoda: I make all and I stay faster than I am in armwrestling. But my bone is a little bit...
Alexey Voevoda: I try to understand you. When you're competing in armwrestling, you're born, it's like this. Very, very strong. Another sport like this.
Alexey Voevoda: Oh, okay, okay, okay. So you are saying that your proportion from the bobsled to armrest, it will take some time for your bones. Yes, yes, yes, yes. In the bobsled, my bones have more airs. Yes. But armrests must have low airs. Then my...
Engin Terzi: Much better. Fix it. Pavel, we don't need you. I didn't know that Alexey was speaking English. Everybody in the chat room is like, wow, Alexey is speaking English. Everybody. No problem, bye. Okay, see you later, Pavel. Hello, Alexey. My name is Pavel. Hello, Pavel. Hello, Pavel. Nice to meet you.
Alexey Voevoda: Yeah, maybe there are some words that you couldn't find, Alexey. Maybe Paolo can explain, if you tell him in Russian. But I understood everything, maybe small details. Okay, okay. Pasha, look, I also told them that the training in bobsleigh is different from the training in armwrestling. And if in armwrestling you need the density of the bones, that is, it turns out that the density of the bones goes,
Alexey Voevoda: This is a consequence of such heavy training with lifting such quite heavy weights, shock loads and so on. In bobsleigh, more flexibility and less bone density. In order to get into the crew, there are two people in the crew, they run 220 kg together with the equipment. And you need to lose weight, and you can lose weight with bone density, it is lost quite well.
Alexey Voevoda: So, Engin, Alexey is talking about the density of the bones.
Paulo (Translator): it's uh different because of the different sports require different training so uh bobsleigh require different training because you can reduce your density of the bones because you don't need the muscles to be that strongly attached uh with the tendons to the bones there is a limit there is a limit weight limits per pair so two on a bobsleigh supposed to be 220 kg with uh all the
Paulo (Translator): keeper you know with all dressing and and uh in arm wrestling it's completely different training so basically you lifting weights you lifting heavy you're doing some impacts on your bones and your bones uh uh getting uh more dense so they weigh more and uh your tendons uh holding your muscles that's interesting yeah that's very interesting yeah very interesting and he says that he says that he will take a year
Alexey Voevoda: One year his bones will be ready. This is what he told me before you came. Alexey, you said that it will take about a year for your bones to be ready for the right warm-up, right? Well, look, just the compression of the bones is such a long factor. Since I am now training on the verge of sports and physical education,
Alexey Voevoda: For me, health is more important than anything else. What can the sport give, because it has already given me Olympic medals. I was at the Olympics in armwrestling. It's cool, great, but then it didn't happen. In principle, this is the life of any athlete, it's a fall, so I'm more for health now. So, to correctly
Alexey Voevoda: to gain bone density, that is, they solidify for quite a long time. Plus, there are also age parameters. Although metabolism up to 50 is about the same as in 20 years, depending on your motor activity,
Alexey Voevoda: Therefore, in order to properly tighten them, in order to make, let's say, your hand really heavy, a heavy hand. Why? Because it is so dense. This density is given within one or two years. If I remember how I started training armwrestling, the first year was
Paulo (Translator): Alexey is talking about bone structure is basically slow working material, so you need a lot of time to change density of the bones.
Paulo (Translator): and uh right now alexey is for a health uh he already was at the top of the limp and at top of the arm wrestling and he got it all but uh as of right now the major factor factor for him is his health so basically his training is somewhere uh between a light fitness and the actual sport not to damage his health so the process
Paulo (Translator): uh the process of that uh changing the density of the bone structure and tendon structure will take time so when he was starting arm wrestling back in the days uh the first year was pretty light training second year it became the heavier trainings and he got to the density he wants to see on the third year of the heavy of his training and it was a very heavy trade
Paulo (Translator): So he said, yeah, one to two years is required to bring the density to the level. And he said, yeah, age is a factor too, but he believes that his metabolism is still there. He's saying that metabolism doesn't really much change between your 20 years and 50 years, but it will change. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When I saw him in Dubai,
Engin Terzi: the way that he was walking everything he was just like you know 18 20 years old guy you know he was just yeah thank you yeah that's true i thought he was gonna just start running you know suddenly he just couldn't stop you know yeah yeah yeah i i saw you also that how you were punching and kicking the sandbag you know the guy could do any other sports you know then i mean and become the best uh as he did in both places and there are some super jets alexi gb19 thank you for your super chat he's asking
Paulo (Translator): Does Alexey plan to pull long time, no matter win or lose? Should I translate, Lyosha? Yes, yes, translate. I got the detail. Yes, someone from the Internet asks a question like this. Artem you going to fight now, after your comeback, for a long time or not? And does it depend on whether you lose or win? Well, in general, the question is, of course, interesting.
Alexey Voevoda: Actually, Engin signed me for this adventure. This is the first moment. He called me and said, do you want to fight with John? I said, I'll think about it. A month passed, I said, in principle, you can. The scales went, it became interesting. Since I have a lot in common with John, and he is really one of the most respected sportsmen in armwrestling, the only one, probably, most respected by me is John Brzenk.
Alexey Voevoda: I always wanted to look like him when I started armwrestling. And so it happened that we met only once, that is, the first was a breakdown, then in ties, and, in principle, he got into the movement that I actually trained. It just happened. And neither he understood anything, nor I understood anything. That is, to fight this legendary person, I want to more than to beat him. This is to beat John.
Paulo (Translator): It's not an achievement, but it's an achievement to fight with him beautifully. Will I succeed in the future? Will I perform? I don't know, but I liked training with weights. Okay, Engin. The answer to this question is that, listen, that's all Engin's fault. He signed me into this adventure.
Paulo (Translator): But listen, listen, listen. But Alexei said that, yes, it's his pleasure to pull with John Brzenk. And it doesn't matter win or lose, actually, in this match. When you first called him, he said that he will think. Then he will start lifting slowly. And in a month, he saw that weights are growing pretty fast and he feels good. So he said, yes, let's do it.
Paulo (Translator): And, uh, with John, they, you know, they tied with that one, uh, one time they met and, uh, the match, uh, was sleep strap. And then John actually was in a position where, uh, Alexi was very strong. He was actually training that part where John hit that's, you know, was the quick win. And he said, we did not understand what's going on, neither John or me.
Paulo (Translator): and uh yes he's absolutely ready to uh pull john and arm wrestle with him to understand what's going on and where they are but uh he's not sure if he's gonna continue actually arm wrestling or not at this point uh but he will for sure keep training with weights he likes it okay so he will decide later yeah yeah yeah i mean whenever listen i have never been an organizer
Engin Terzi: But during the COVID, everything stopped. So I started to organize. And when the things are going well, I wanted to invite all the legends to come back, you understand? Come back to the sport. Because like many years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years on the social media, Alex and I say, what if Voivoda comes back? Can Voivoda be this guy today or not? You know, like 20 years, there was like on social media. And I was like,
Engin Terzi: I mean why were they still very young and he's still very strong so let's let's ask him, you know, and then, if he wants to come back, you will be great. It is like you know, like all the time you think about it, you talk about it, but you know that it will never happen, but now it's happening, you know, but people needs to understand that this is very important moment for our mercy or.
Engin Terzi: legendary god john bersing pulling legendary alexey voivoda it's it's incredible event for me it's like dream event and i think that people will understand this um better and i think i hope that they will pay the attention that it deserves yeah yeah it's it's good and there was there was another another stripper chat for him
Engin Terzi: Kaan Turk says, my two favorite arm masters, heavyweight goat and pound for pound goat in the same screen. I am so excited. Salute to both of your legends. Thank you very much, Kaan Turk. And so, Alexey, your weight is now 112 kilo. And I see that you are in very good shape. I had a podcast with Bob Ken and Denis, and you were there as well, Paolo.
Engin Terzi: and and they say that dennis said that you are physically ready your power is there but you didn't pull for a long time you know you didn't compete and so dennis also has the same question are you mentally ready for that stage psychologically and
Engin Terzi: So, some people say that, hey, listen, he is an Olympic athlete, you know, Olympic athlete. So, of course, he's psychologically ready. If you compete in the Olympics, yeah, that's the answer, yeah. But, Alexey, don't you think that, like, physical combat sport is a little bit different? Like, you have an opponent, he's trying to win against you. There is a physical contact. Is it a little bit different than what you did in the Olympics? Let me tell you a little bit about it.
Paulo (Translator): In the beginning, we talked about the podcast with Denis and Bob Ken. Bob Ken said that physically you are 100% ready, that is, the strength comes back to you very quickly. And Engin has a question like this. How do you think, mentally and morally, will you be ready for the fight? Because you haven't fought for a very long time. But then he remembered that you are an Olympic champion. He says, no, well, Olympic champions should always be mentally ready for everything.
Alexey Voevoda: But the fight is different, I understand. He said that the fight is a little different, because you still have contact with the opponent. The fact is that if you take my two disciplines, armwrestling and bobsleigh, they are completely different. But everywhere you need to concentrate on the moment, the moment. Everything happens in a moment, here and now.
Alexey Voevoda: And if you know how to catch this moment, in fact, then you, in principle, caught both the movement and the run and the landing. Any element, if you lose, in the sense that you did something wrong, you lose. There are actually too many inputs to perform at the Olympic level in bobsleigh.
Alexey Voevoda: Here I am like in my own water. For me, armwrestling is like a quiet harbor, like my own home. And for me, armwrestling has always been a kind of community, some kind of family. Yes, there are strange guys, characters, but they usually come and go.
Alexey Voevoda: But normal guys, as they fought, they still fight. This is exactly what John and many other guys think. So I can say that mentally... I'm sorry, I'll interrupt you. Will you stay a normal boy in our family now? Will you continue to fight with us? Did I become an abnormal boy? You ran away from us, you didn't fight with us. I didn't run away from you.
Alexey Voevoda: First of all, I got bored, I had no one to fight with, objectively. Second, I had the opportunity to show myself in a different discipline. I was not stopped as soon as possible. Let me answer this question first, finish it, and then talk about it. Mentally and physically, I am ready for armwrestling fights. I will repeat myself.
Alexey Voevoda: There is something that you gradually gain in the fight. This is the density of the bones. This is a factor that few people take into account. Therefore, I do plyometrics, that is, the striking method. I have static dynamics. I have a very extensive and wide training. I don't show it much. I tried to demonstrate to people.
Alexey Voevoda: As it turned out, it's more interesting who won who in the match. Although it doesn't give anything, it doesn't show anything. One is tired more, the other is less. One is sick, one is too nervous. As a result, one is bad at throwing, the other is good. As a result, this one is stronger. In fact, this one is stronger, because this one will rest and beat the one who fights well in training. It doesn't give anything, but people like movement.
Alexey Voevoda: That's why I stopped showing my training, in fact, yes, all that volume. And I can say for sure that mentally I am ready, because this is, again, a quiet haven, this is the very family from which I never, in fact, left. I have always been with you. I always tried to help the guys there. I have a bunch of students, the guys who always came to me for advice. I always gave, well, the most professional advice.
Alexey Voevoda: I showed absolutely everything and told everything that I know in this sport. Therefore, it is not scary for me to perform mentally, it is not scary for me to perform physically either. I am ready in terms of weight. I have a fight, another point. To fight, you have to fight. And you have to fight often and a lot. Previously, I fought for a week, hours, probably, not to lie, a day for three hours. This is a constant carousel.
Alexey Voevoda: And I fought 7 days a week. Count it. That's a lot. That's almost a day a week. And of course, I just put my hand and that's it. And I understood everything right away. Absolutely. Now, of course, it's not like that yet.
Alexey Voevoda: And I don't know if I will be able to spend as much time in wrestling, due to the fact that I have quite a lot of water circumstances. But mentally, I repeat, I am also ready. Because armwrestling is my favorite sport. Translate it somehow so that everyone understands. Thank you. Okay, the answer was very long. I will shorten it up a little bit. So Alexey is saying, yes, absolutely, I am ready mentally.
Paulo (Translator): and uh physically and physically and he said because arm wrestling is my base sport in my home basically i'm returning to my quiet and comfort sport where i used to be very good and i'm still good yeah absolutely it's making a little bit of the difference because of the uh difference in uh trainings he used to pull about three hours a day seven days a week
Paulo (Translator): right now he cannot do as as much of the pulling uh but he's still training people he's still pulling at the table uh and uh he he's a little uh a little bit worried maybe about technique maybe because he's not pulling as much as he used to but he's not worried at all about his mental or physical readiness so he's absolutely ready physically and mentally
Engin Terzi: Also, he's training, sparring with very top-level athletes, training together with Morozov, with Dadikian, and those guys are at the top, so training with them also gives him some advantage. This is what I realized, yeah. Let me explain. I'll translate it for those who don't understand. Go ahead.
Paulo (Translator): Engin says that you still have an advantage, because you have the opportunity to train and sprint with such top athletes as Dedikyan and Morozov. And so, of course, by sprinting with such guys, you gain your form faster.
Alexey Voevoda: I would probably say differently. Of course, it's a plus to spar with strong guys, but it's also a minus. It's also a minus. Let me explain. If you, for example, came to sparring, but you came tired, you couldn't perform well in sparring, you couldn't keep your body angles normally, and you have a slight feeling that you are just a bag with bones, you can't fight normally.
Alexey Voevoda: There are nuances everywhere. When I was preparing for those competitions in 2004-2003, I had strong and strong sportsmen. I had a whole base. I had my gym in the 8th school.
Alexey Voevoda: such conical, normal, these dumbbells, a little rusty, soaked in sweat and blood. The table was all covered with our elbows. That is, not that soft, good leather, or some kind of leather. No, we just had some kind of, let's say, a hard bedside table on top. And we broke our elbows on this hard table.
Alexey Voevoda: And I fought with the guys, they helped me prepare. Ordinary guys, not some world champions. They just helped me keep myself in all corners so that I could perform normally. If you are a thinking athlete, this is enough for you, in fact, in a good way. You understand, you did this, this, this. Boxing did so much, biceps so much, weight so much, pronation so much. So, okay, fight, not enough. What do you lack? Yeah, you worked from the wrong angles. Okay, let's work from other angles.
Alexey Voevoda: Now you don't hold me like this, but like this. And I will pull you out of here. Okay, okay. I tried once, I did it. What should we do? Why is everyone fighting on a pillow? Why do we need pillows? We even need them. We remove pillows. We removed pillows. You see, this is such a creative process. Training has always been for me.
Alexey Voevoda: Therefore, I will say that sparring with good sparring partners is definitely a plus. But, I repeat, in such a long training process, I believe that even if you don't have good sparring partners, you can adapt the entire gym to you if you have brains. And the result will not be worse. Okay, let's try to translate.
Paulo (Translator): Okay, so Alexey's answer is like this. Yes, absolutely, it's a big plus to have somebody like top athletes available for your sparrings, but there is also a minuses because if you're having them constantly all the time and you, let's say, get to the sparring training
Paulo (Translator): not ready, or tired, or something like that, you know, not just not ready for this table time, then you will feel like a bag with a bones basically, like, like nothing because you cannot hold your angles, you cannot do anything can you cannot basically finish your spine. That's why Alexi remembering almost sounds like a nostalgia for his preparation in 2003 2004. He used to have a gym school number eight, where was your
Paulo (Translator): a little right you're getting caught we don't hear you uh a little stinky okay give me just one second now it's good yeah yeah so he used to have his gym with uh two three guys uh
Paulo (Translator): arm wrestlers not not very top of the level but he could use them and yeah whatever two hands two hands to give just to train purposes traps yeah traps and etc etc and he was working the perfect angles needs for himself so that's that's the answer but he said yeah absolutely sometimes absolutely it's very good to have a top athlete to sparring Chris
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah i agree i agree yeah i mean like i also trained with the super heavyweight guys here like with ferret and with arif and then they just hold me they are stronger than me they are almost twice size you know and they give me training because they can control i say like a little bit more here a little bit less here so probably alexi was doing that with those guys with the two hands you know and doing the same thing yeah yeah it's very good training i agree
Engin Terzi: I agree. So, Alexei, you don't know if you are going to continue or not. You don't have any goal at all, like to, like,
Engin Terzi: reach somewhere or you just see this like a nostalgic match, a historical match, or like, do you have any goal right now? Your weight is 112. Do you have any goal to become the best in just say maybe 115 kilo or no, no goal at all. You will just pull for whenever you want or just like enjoy, or can you also explain in better way, Paolo?
Paulo (Translator): Yes. First of all, he commented that it is good to have such trainings. And he trains himself. Arif and other superweights come to him. And he trains with superweights. They are, of course, stronger than him, because they are twice as big as him. And he says, what, in what angles, hold it here more, hold it here less. He says, yes, one hundred percent. Of course, it is much better to train in this way.
Paulo (Translator): And then he asks you, do you have any goals for the near future in armwrestling? Or will you just come and fight for now, and maybe you will fight from time to time, just to get this pleasure? Or is there still some goal, for example, to become the best in 115 kg?
Alexey Voevoda: That's a good question. If I have a goal, you know, in fact, I need to start. And then, in principle, you can ask this question. I repeat, I like to lift weights, and I think that in general we need to create some kind of federation, to bring out about 6-7 exercises.
Alexey Voevoda: We have arm lifting, strict lifting on the biceps. We need to do pronation in a certain way, bok, biceps, piramid, I don't know, solar plexus, something else. A couple of such exercises and make an international federation for multi-sport. What is it for?
Alexey Voevoda: There is such a term as lowering the entry threshold to sports. What does it mean? It means that we create a precedent in which we have, let's say, roughly speaking, there is an armwrestling federation, there is an armwrestling federation.
Alexey Voevoda: Any guy can come to the gym and try to lift weights and figure out at what level they are. Anyway, lifting weights correlates with physical form in a certain way.
Alexey Voevoda: Of course, this is not a one-hundred percent match. I lifted 100 kilograms on the biceps and won everyone in the biceps. No, not a fact. But there is a big chance that if someone with you gets into the biceps and you lift 100 kilograms on the biceps, then, of course, you will win a person who lifts 80. And he will fall into your angle and vector. Therefore, we need to form some kind of legal activity, make an international federation.
Alexey Voevoda: And in fact, it will be very interesting. It will be world records, it will also be juniors and grandmasters. This is the kind of movement that is also needed to lead to our wonderful armwrestling. And that's probably what I would be interested in doing, developing something that we still have, even in the beginning. What is not enough. Tell me, Lyosha, I'll just ask you to collect all this information correctly.
Alexey Voevoda: Do you see it as a part of armwrestling? No, it's a separate federation. The armwrestling federation has been discrediting itself a little lately. To be honest, I'm disappointed in some aspects. I'm talking about the international one. I say that we need to create a new international institute, an international federation that would help to get the guys out of the street.
Alexey Voevoda: pull them into such condos, normal, clear gyms, under common rules, under common concepts and with a common idea. Because in fact, in practice, I can say that armwrestling is a good genetic filter. If people have good hands, most likely he has strong legs. This is actually 95%.
Paulo (Translator): Okay, so the answer was like this. Let's start first, and then after we started, we will decide. And he said that he repeated himself that yes, he likes to lift weight, but
Paulo (Translator): the ideas in his head is not actually to continue as a big athlete which is possible but he will start and he will decide later but to create uh a new international federation we're separate from uh arm wrestling federation but very correlated to it basically uh like a power lifting federation but uh arm wrestling related lifts pronator biceps uh maybe side
Paulo (Translator): maybe some other lifts you know correlated to specific to arm wrestling to bring more people into uh sports in total in and into arm wrestling and basically this sport uh this lifting uh federation or arm wrestling lifting federation whatever will be like a filter uh or like an entrance point for a bigger arm wrestler
Engin Terzi: So he is suggesting that to create another federation and there will be like same as like bench press, like barbell curve for the power lifting. So for arm wrestling, we will have the pronation lift, riser lift, wrist curve, you know, okay, I understand. That's interesting. That's very interesting. It's going to be a new world record and it's going to be a new people who is most likely going to be an arm wrestlers also because it's very correlated to arm wrestling.
Engin Terzi: It makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. That, that, that we should consider as well. Yeah. We need to make the things, uh, more exciting for everyone. Yeah. I agree. And I like to see you, you come in as a special guest for Istanbul on November or not. Maybe, maybe it will be honored to have you here. It will be honored. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: For November also, Devon Saginashvili and Arsen Liliyev coming. And we would be very honored if Alexey, if you would come as a special guest, we would be very honored here. And so, Alexey, so you have less than two weeks. You have only 12 days. And thank you for accepting to be our guest. And how do you feel right now? Only 12 days.
Engin Terzi: The preparation finished or still training? How is your method? How close to the event do you continue training? When do you stop arm wrestling? When do you stop lifting heavy? And when do you stop lifting light? He says that there are only two weeks left. And he asks the following question. How close to the fight or to the competition do you stop? And now concretely went to fight for the table.
Paulo (Translator): And how close to competitions do you stop lifting weights and training at all? And how long does your mental breakdown take?
Alexey Voevoda: Look, I haven't done anything for two weeks in general. I just moved slowly in order to have such an active desire to act. When my muscles start to shrink on their own,
Alexey Voevoda: The first sign that I have a top form, because the body wants to get some kind of load, that is, it has recovered. Whether this is good or bad, but in principle, practice shows, according to my own and Babsley's speeches, that this is exactly the top form. I need about two weeks to do nothing. For a month I had to
Alexey Voevoda: 10 days ago, I had to do good hard sparring. But it so happened that I got up from the sofa and spent a week on the back after that. Amazing. That is, I did a stand-up pull 320 times.
Alexey Voevoda: I did 107-109 kg on the beam. I just did it, did it, did it. I took a big dumbbell, 150 kg, lifted it with one hand. I do everything here in the gym. Instead of a dumbbell, I just do a barbell. I don't have such a big dumbbell. I want to order everything custom, but I just can't.
Alexey Voevoda: And everything was fine. And then just once, at one point, this evening I was supposed to have training, I get up from the sofa, my back is flat, and that's what happened. I don't know. Most likely, I overloaded one side, I didn't load the second one, I spasmed somewhere, stretched it out somewhere. And now I have one old trauma. So, I picked myself up now. Accordingly, I worked on the start recently. I have
Alexey Voevoda: My student, who is now the second in the world championship, on the right hand, 85, Davit. He arrived, he is a good starter, we started with him. He already lives in America. And somehow we worked out the start with him, and that's it. This is basically all the load that I will do now. Little by little, somewhere in percent, maybe 30-40, I take 40-50 kilograms, I make a side one at a time, so that I can just drive the blood.
Alexey Voevoda: I don't do heavy weights anymore, because there is no point in it. You need to recover from the ligaments. From the ligaments, bones, and, accordingly, mentally, you need to approach the competition with a desire to fight. With a desire. And with the intention to win. Or at least show a beautiful fight. Okay. I understand. Engines. So, basically, the time of rule is two weeks.
Paulo (Translator): do nothing absolutely nothing uh complete rest uh you know uh alexis said that uh uh he wants to be at the table or at the tournament with a big will to pull or to do something so his body needs those you know those extreme uh pulling uh loads so he wants to do uh but
Paulo (Translator): training technically he already done with any heavy training and for the last week uh she doing a light blood flow he said 30 uh you know she said 40 50 kilos you know some biceps curls and stuff like that for uh repetition uh before that he did uh very heavy trainings like another week before so basically a month to the uh to the event he did a very very heavy stuff like 320 kg
Paulo (Translator): uh uh deadlift for uh repetitions uh like 107 kg for uh uh angle you know and uh and he he'd been lifting uh 150 kg with one arm uh the barbell and he said that uh like next morning or a couple mornings later he woke up and he felt something not good with uh his back
Paulo (Translator): So he did not do a last table training, which was supposed to be about a month before the event. So because of the small injury at that time, but now everything is fine. He put the things together and getting ready mentally to, you know, to want to want to be on a table.
Alexey Voevoda: Okay, I understand. So two things, nothing, absolutely nothing. One more, please, one more. Another very important thing. I'm just listening to my body. Just add it.
Alexey Voevoda: And when there are some strange nuances, it seems that I had to do something else, but suddenly my back gave up. I think that, most likely, fate tells me that it will be enough. Therefore, I decided that it would be enough and worked only at the start. Translate it like that. You need to listen to yourself.
Paulo (Translator): so uh and alex adding something that's very important to listen to your body and listen to yourself and he when when when the back started to hurt he said probably that's enough of heavy lifting and heavy stuff and he just uh let it go and uh he works uh uh just uh you know start with his uh training partner who is actually uh took second in the world on this world so he's
Paulo (Translator): in 85 kilos and he's very fast at the start so david so they worked at the starts and he said you know what i will listen to myself and uh that's probably a sign to be enough and to work yeah yeah lighter and something else
Engin Terzi: I agree. I agree that the mind shouldn't be static, you know. We need to listen to body and make decisions according to what our body is telling us as well. There needs to be some basic things, you know, plan, but there needs to be some changes, you know, according to the situation. No plan. Just move. Yeah. Small plans, yes. I do make plans, but if I see as your back horse, oh, yeah, this is a sign. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I agree, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Alexey, a lot of people are asking how you would compare yourself today to your prime time.
Alexey Voevoda: to your best form then, probably in 2004. What percentage or how would you rate it? You know, it's a very bad habit to look for similarity in a person in 20 years, at least. To highlight some percentages, again, I repeat, to focus on sparring.
Alexey Voevoda: I'm different. I've become completely different mentally, physically and morally. I went through quite a serious school. When I fought with Tim Breston, a lot of things became clear to me, including about the fans.
Alexey Voevoda: about how they can troll you in one second, I don't know why, in fact. Although I never showed anything and, sorry for the expression, did not make a comment to the judges. I never did this, but, accordingly, there was a situation. I understood a lot for myself, and now I'm just a completely different person. I'm not very concerned about what they write about me, what they say about me.
Alexey Voevoda: I am more concerned about how I will meet a person I respect, how I will fight with him. And to be honest, Larratt recently said a very good thing. I respect him so much that I don't want to win, you know. I just want to fight. And John is the same person with whom, you know, I want to fight from the bottom of my heart. To feel the strong and weak sides, you know, for real.
Alexey Voevoda: to reveal the whole potential of the fight. It is John who can give it to you. Well, in any case, the John that I know is a great, smart and professional John. Therefore, it is important for me now not only to be thought about, to be told, but also to assess the percentage of what I was yesterday and what I am now completely different.
Alexey Voevoda: Now there are completely different indicators. Now I'm just looking at some things that appeared on the table, this straight weight, straight blocks. For some reason, they do not fix the shoulder, that is, the elbow does not fix the shoulder, it hangs, raises the weight. They do not save on shoulder bags.
Alexey Voevoda: From the point of view of traumatology, you can be traumatized in such a way that in life you will even lift a spoon with effort, unfortunately. And some of the records that modern armwrestlers set, armwrestlers of today, they are quite controversial from the point of view of
Alexey Voevoda: Traumatization, I would say so. Therefore, I am now trying to repeat the exercises that LORAT does, but LORAT does it through the elbow. He actually disconnects the shoulder. Therefore, I would say that I am different, I am not weak.
Alexey Voevoda: If you take my bench press, I press for 200. I pressed in my best physical form, I think, 225 or 235, I don't remember how much, twice with a narrow grip. Now I press for about 205-210, but I just practice the bench press once a week, that is, I don't try to press more.
Alexey Voevoda: Therefore, I can say for sure that I am very strong physically, but I am different morally, morally, ethically. In general, in principle, I am a different person. I am more mature, more conscious and less focused on the fact that I am being trolled, or asked to do something, or asked to comment on something else. Something like that, probably. I don't know, try to tie it all together. You are a smart guy, I think you will succeed.
Paulo (Translator): So answer was complicated and pretty long, but I will try to shorten it up. And Alexey doesn't want to compare his actual percentages to what it was and what it's now because he's completely different human, completely different mentally and physically.
Paulo (Translator): His training did not change much, but he's very closely watching the modern training and modern lifts on social media. He was trying to do the lift which Devon De La Rapp did. He said that lift is relatively okay because at least he was fixing his elbow to his leg or to his knee. But otherwise, people now lifting without fixation, heavy weight without fixation the elbow.
Paulo (Translator): all the weights is damaging the shoulders. And he said, I'm not doing this goofy stuff. He said, I'm not weak for sure because in my prime, let's say I did bench for, he doesn't remember exactly, 225 or 235 kilos for two. And right now he's benching once a week and he's benching about 210 kg for two. Almost the same.
Paulo (Translator): Yeah, it's comparable weights. It's maybe a little bit less, but not much. It's very, very comparable. But otherwise, he said, I'm not weak, definitely.
Paulo (Translator): and uh yeah he said but it's not only about the physical power i'm also getting the mentally and he said i have so much respect to jump to this man that it's almost that i don't want to win with him i just want to enjoy a process of the super match and i want to just arm wrestle you know not to make it quick but just enjoy the process
Engin Terzi: I understand yeah so and yeah and and the other thing that people are asking like do you ever time to time train with Denis Alexey this is people are asking probably 300 people asked already or the same guy is all time asking I'm not sure
Alexey Voevoda: Do you train with Denis sometimes or not? Well, let's put it this way. Denis now has his own trajectory of movement. In fact, it's difficult for us. I live in Sochi, he lives in Moscow, in the Moscow region even. If I even come to Moscow, he lives in the Moscow region. If you know, he has been to Kazakhstan now. As a matter of fact, he is a well-known person, and, accordingly, he is in demand. He is constantly somewhere.
Alexey Voevoda: And so that we can always go somewhere together, it needs to be planned in advance. And, unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. When I was working in Moscow, it was easier. In any case, in two or three weeks I will come. In three weeks I will be there too. Now it's a little different. Now I'm mostly in Sochi and I'm training at home.
Alexey Voevoda: So did I train with Denis? I trained with him before, but mostly I trained for him. In fact, all sparrings we did in order to exclude any weaknesses and nuances in Denis' wrestling. Because I didn't perform then. When I started preparing now, unfortunately, not a single sparring has been held yet. Again, I repeat,
Alexey Voevoda: It is very wrong and strange to rely on the movement that you see in sparring. There is absolutely no logic in this, because I have a rich life experience, I have athletes who carry everyone in the gym, they keep me in the biceps, they just keep me.
Alexey Voevoda: They are taken out into the biceps by those whom I don't even feel in the biceps. The question is, how does this happen and why? Again, I repeat, it's a different story, a different approach to training. For me, training is training. I will just get out in the most uncomfortable positions for me, pull myself out from the most uncomfortable angles.
Alexey Voevoda: I train like this. I have such a story. And I don't look very good on camera when I'm sparring. For me, this is a competition. I just understand that no matter what happens, you have to do it.
Alexey Voevoda: And the training is not comfortable, I take care of myself. Why? Because training is a process, and competitions are the result of this process.
Paulo (Translator): Unfortunately, no, in a recent time they are not training together because Denis is living in Moscow, actually in Moscow suburbs, not in actual Moscow.
Paulo (Translator): And Alexey is living in Sochi, so it's a distance. Plus, Denis is very popular and very wanted man in the industry right now, so he's traveling a lot. Plus, they have a completely different training, not training process, but training point because differential of the time, you know.
Paulo (Translator): I'm actually having a super match and he's getting ready for now, then he's getting ready for November. So different stages, basically. And the people not really paying much attention to a training sparring because this is a training.
Paulo (Translator): And it's exactly what it means. It's training, so you're trying to get better. You position yourself in different uncomfortable angles and trying to work out from those uncomfortable angles to get better. And you probably don't look good on camera. It's not for camera. It's for training purposes. The actual super match or actual tournament, that's the result. And that's the end result of your training process.
Engin Terzi: where you yes at your best and at your maximum and please watch those not training videos yeah yeah yeah i mean training videos people enjoy to watch we cannot really stop them but as he said you know that is what matters is the competition not the training training you may just may not look good but that's the like all you're doing the training
Engin Terzi: is for competition. So the most important is the competition. And Alexey, now you have been following arm wrestling. I'm sure you are also following East versus West matches and King of the Table matches. How do you see today's arm wrestling? Like, how do you see the level of the arm wrestlers? And also, what do you think?
Engin Terzi: are there any arm masters that are taking your attention? What is your general view about all this today?
Paulo (Translator): Alexey, I'm sure that you watch the events in armwrestling, because it's your sport, your secret haven. What is your general opinion about these competitions and about modern athletes and armwrestling in particular?
Alexey Voevoda: So, well, probably right away, step-by-step, question number one. I can't check for 100%, because I can't pay for broadcasts sometimes. I'm sorry, in principle, it never works. As a result, I watch either already post-factum, unfortunately,
Alexey Voevoda: Or I can do it, but through some kind of resources. Unfortunately, this is how it comes out, and not always in good quality, not always they show. Sometimes the fight comes and then it is interrupted. Therefore, King of the Table and East and West, of course, it is necessary to do something so that fans in Russia could at least watch these fights, because I am still in Russia.
Alexey Voevoda: We also have other AMC tournaments, where you can easily pay, they quickly send you a link, you watch and basically enjoy the process.
Alexey Voevoda: Of course, they shoot more beautifully. East and West and King of the Table are geniuses in shooting beautifully. No questions. I really like how they shoot. Regarding the overall level. You know, it's very difficult. In general, in principle, there used to be a grid. Everyone fought in the grid. Now the top fighters are fighting with the top athletes. But the grid has its own magic.
Alexey Voevoda: That is, there is a magic in wrestling in the net. This is both endurance and high adaptability. If you prepare specifically for one person, you can understand some of his weaknesses, strengths, and overcome them. When you fight in the net, all the gunpowder of this net, there is an ordinary competition in armwrestling, which was professional,
Alexey Voevoda: It is impossible to foresee everything. This is also an interesting story. And it seems to me that we also need to do the grid somewhere. Because the grid is such an interesting mixture that somehow gives something.
Alexey Voevoda: I don't know, when I was preparing for the TETKA, you probably catch more jim-jim than if you were preparing for one person. This is true. Yes, well, that's how my jim-jim is now. In jim-jim? Well, I don't know, listen, try to explain.
Paulo (Translator): Okay, Engin, so basically the answer is
Paulo (Translator): it was a little bit too long. So unfortunately, he's in Russia, and he cannot usually watch live stream on pay per view, because he cannot make a payment and stuff like that. But he's, he's very often watching afterwards when it's, you know, available platforms, YouTube, and so on. So he said that
Paulo (Translator): uh absolutely your uh uh show and your camera work and presentation is great yes the you you and yours and the king of the table he also watching amc uh about general level of the arm wrestlers we did not talk much because he said you know what uh to be honest i like a regular tournament uh where you know
Paulo (Translator): open uh double elimination tournaments where we can uh face everybody and anybody at the same time and that's more attractive for him and uh it kicks more adrenaline in his body and stuff like that but uh uh unfortunately that's that's where where the arm wrestling is going and uh unfortunately uh but he likes that open tournaments more like amc and he's watching also in following that one
Paulo (Translator): So that's what approximately I commented on this. I know I'm an only translator here, but yeah, I'm start missing the open tournaments too. I start my career with a super professional career with a super matches and I'm missing the tournament very much.
Engin Terzi: It's definitely my thing too. I love it. Yeah, the only thing is that like many of the sports like boxing or like when it is in amateur level, it is all tournaments. But when it comes to the professional level, like you go Olympics, boxing is a tournament, like quarter finals, semifinals, finals.
Engin Terzi: But whenever you go to the professional boxing, you don't see that. You see one on one. So this is the natural process. Also, the tournament has good size and bad size, like you and I.
Engin Terzi: We are the absolute favorites. We may, round one, kill each other. Two minutes. And then someone will come and beat you and beat me and then win the event, you know? So it is good. No, no, no, no way. No way. I'll let you win, Engin. I'll let you win. Listen, if you are not one head above everyone in tournaments,
Engin Terzi: there is always risk. You may have a one long match, and then the other guy has an easy draw in the second round. You pull two minutes earlier, the guy just boom, and then you pull him and he beats you. Pressure, pressure, beating. And that's the key. That's not the key, that's the luck. All the time you have to squeeze your butt. That is the luck, my friend. But if you are super good, if you beat everyone,
Engin Terzi: No problem. But if you are closed, anything can happen. You know, Alex, I also competed for like 25 years, you know. I remember you. You and I competed in the same events. We competed in 2003 in Germany, Hanu. And then we competed in the Ottawa Worlds in 2003. And then I think the next one was Gdynia or Gdansk, 2004? Gdynia. Gdynia, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: I remember you had some with Pushkar, rest in peace, you know, he had some, yeah, and he got injured. You remember, right? I think it was final, he got injured, yeah. Yeah, yeah, you turn in and you beat him like this inside. Yeah, I remember, yeah. Yeah, it was a good time. You ever heard of Klimenko, Alexey? After that time... Have you ever heard of Klimenko?
Paulo (Translator): When he started performing for juniors, he was quite famous, but then he disappeared. He said when he started in juniors, he was pretty famous, but after that he didn't hear about him.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, I understand. Anyway, so, Alexei, it was very great, great, great to host you here. And hopefully, we see you in Istanbul. If you come as a special guest, if you accept, we will be very honored. And do you want to, anything more before we finish? Do you want to give any message to the community or your opponent, to John Brzenk, any message, anything you would like to add? We would like to hear.
Paulo (Translator): You're getting cut, Paolo. We don't hear you. Paolo?
Paulo (Translator): It's bad, bad, the connection is building up. And there may be some message before... Yeah, that's it, that's it, now it's okay, yeah, that's it. It's okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's okay. It says that it hopes that you will receive an invitation to be a special guest at E-SW and asks if there is something to add, or if you want to add something, or maybe some message to give to John.
Alexey Voevoda: I can only say one thing to John. I will be glad to see him. This is the first thing. And secondly, I will be glad to fight with him. I am glad that I can do it.
Alexey Voevoda: Thank you very much, Engin, for your hospitality and for asking questions. It's interesting to answer those questions.
Paulo (Translator): to john it's uh uh his pleasure that he can and have opportunity uh to arm wrestle with the legend uh huge respect to john uh to me thank you for translation yeah and alexis alexis they are also asking you about your diet
Engin Terzi: They are saying that, Andy, how did Alexei Voevoda change his diet to return? Is he drinking soy protein instead of milk protein? And is he thinking about going back to meat for a while? He says, after all, the meat is power. What do you think about your diet? You know, just shortly, if you can tell us. That was interesting, that's why I asked you. Not short, it's impossible. Okay, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
Paulo (Translator): Go long, go long. It's okay. Power.
Alexey Voevoda: The second point is that there is very little protein in meat. Overcooking meat is a toxic process. Next, do I consume protein? Yes, I increase the amount of protein, but through seed proteins, there are a lot of good vegan proteins that really allow the body, that is, these are the dietary fibers that activate the gastrointestinal peristalsis. In general, if I
Alexey Voevoda: I will go into the depth of dietology, it will be a conversation for half an hour. In fact, if it is short, then there is no energy in meat. We have monounsaturated acids, not proteins that everyone thinks we need protein. Monounsaturated acids are actually in any food, including vegetable ones.
Alexey Voevoda: And no, I'm not going to go back to meat, because the risk of oncology increases many times if a person consumes red meat. The World Health Organization published a report 15 years ago.
Alexey Voevoda: Do I want to get sick? No, I don't want to. I don't like going to doctors at all, really. And I don't advise anyone. You need to take care of your health. Therefore, I say, I try to go somewhere between sports and physical culture. Here, on the edge, on the edge. Therefore, I say, that is, if I can lose or pull out a joint bag, a shoulder, I will not do those weights where I am already really scared for my physical health.
Alexey Voevoda: If I understand that in order to swing the bar up, for example, I need to put on a vest of 20 kilograms, because then I have more powerful inertia, and my hands are in the corners, in principle, they hold.
Alexey Voevoda: then I can throw 160 and 170 like that. The question is just why should I do it, my lower back will suffer. This is also a minus. I don't do it. That is, I can do 140-150, but I won't go further. I don't see any point in that. On a pip-pip or on Scott's bench, you can do more, there is at least some logic.
Alexey Voevoda: First of all, there is no energy in the meat. Second of all, in the meat there is not too much of the protein.
Paulo (Translator): Third of all, oncology, eating meat may bring the oncology into your body. So, Alexei usually drinking organic or non-dairy proteins from different
Paulo (Translator): not proteins not not not not enough english i'm sorry guys so with different nuts and other products but non-meat and non-dairy products so no alexi is not planning to go back to meat eating because it's not necessary for him and this is his lifestyle and that's what it is
Paulo (Translator): uh also yeah yeah go ahead also about about he said i'm very very much here about my health right now and uh it's you know and as he said he's somewhere between fitness and actual sport in that range so uh he said i can lift probably with some special equipment like curl uh cheat curl like 170 kilos but why would i do it because it's a problem with my lower back
Engin Terzi: 150 is enough. That's it. I will stop right there. Yeah, because same with the diet. And diet is a lifestyle. Yeah. And the final question, Alexey. Okay, no problem. November 11. Denis Cyplenkov? Or Devon Larratt? Who is winning? Hard question.
Alexey Voevoda: Well, in fact, if all the input data is made, just the sum of factors, Devon fights well, that is, he loses once, then he specifically prepares for a check and wins. But knowing Denis, his fingers, wrist and ability to withstand long loads, even in open or closed corners, will be a good fight. I hope friendship will win.
Paulo (Translator): Wow, it's a short answer. Okay. It must be a political answer. I will try to deliver it as it is. So the answer was like this. Devon is very good, but sometimes he's losing to the guy and then he will get ready for this guy and he will win.
Paulo (Translator): uh and alexi knows how dennis's fingers and wrists are strong and he can hold on to uh very serious loads for very prolongated times even in the open angles then he make a pause and he said i hope that the friendship is gonna win
Engin Terzi: Friendship. I told you. I told you it's a political issue. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much, Alexey. One more time. Thank you very, very much for joining us. And Pablo, thank you very much for helping us. Thank you. Yeah. And then thanks to everyone who has been following us. And you take care of yourself, Alexey. And good luck. Good luck in Dubai. Also, good luck to John. Whoever is the better, let him win.
Host: And hope to see you next time, my friend.
