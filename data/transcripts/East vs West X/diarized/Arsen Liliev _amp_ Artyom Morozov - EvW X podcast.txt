Engin Terzi: I'm joking. I'm joking. I think you should stick to your weight category. I know, but in the US, inside the United States, there is not too many people on my weight class who can challenge that. Yeah, I agree. I agree. It's normal. But whenever you say that I'm going to challenge
Engin Terzi: Morozov, I'm going to challenge Laletin or Levan, then that little bit looks a little bit, yeah. No, no, I'm not. I'm not flying high. I mean, I'm working on the ears. Yeah, yeah. I think Arsen Liliev just came. Yeah. Artem, did you like the super matches on the East versus West side? Yes, yes, good match, good match. Good matches, yeah?
Engin Terzi: yes i i want to see this event yeah hello arsene how are you arsene i think he didn't fix the sound yet yeah yeah he is now you hear me now arsene привет арсен слышишь нас арсен микрофон включите пожалуйста
Paulo: I think maybe he doesn't hear us. Do you hear us, Arsen? Yes, it's connected. It's connected. Do you hear us? Yes. Can you hear us? And now? Mask it louder. Great. Okay. Turn the phone to the side.
Engin Terzi: Hello, Arsene, how are you, my friend? Hello, hello again. Thank you, and you, how are you? How's your shape now? Was that your internet is a little bit sometimes lagging? What did you say? So give me one minute. Okay, okay, okay.
Artem Morozov: Artyom, which is your favorite match? Before that one, people are asking how is your stomach, is it better now? How is your stomach? I can't keep a diet at home because I live with my parents and they cook what they eat. And I have to eat everything and suffer.
Artem Morozov: But I drink medicine. I try to stick to it when I eat myself. No, everything is fine, in theory. Everything is fine. And I slowly gave up on bad habits. Everyone knows. And it's okay. And I'm training. As for now, there is no desire. No, there is a desire. There are just a lot of ideas. I can't implement all this in training.
Artem Morozov: I think we have few hours in a day and few days in a week. I need more.
Paulo: uh yeah he said that everything is going forward everything is much better uh there is a little uh issues because uh artem is living with the parents and parents cooking a lot and everything whatever they eat and it's very hard for him to be strict on a diet because you know there is a lot of members and like to eat them so he's eating
Paulo: everything but uh medications and still dieting so he's much better everything is fine by now he doesn't eat junk anymore and he is getting rid of his bad habits he's saying that training wise
Paulo: you have so many ideas that there is not enough hours in a day or days in a week to you know complete all the ideas you have training wise i think can you turn your phone impossible yeah
Engin Terzi: I have a question for you, Artung, before we start everything, you know. I remember when we did a podcast together, I think there was Bobcan, Denis and you, and you were just challenging Devon that, you know,
Engin Terzi: destroy you and remember those things you know you were saying and then and then and then you were saying like what was it you were saying like tell me something tell me I'm the greatest or something remember you were saying I know my question is my question is after you saw Devon with Hermes did your opinion change about Devon being an easy opponent for you
Paulo: Let me translate a little bit so that everyone understands who is watching us and who is speaking Russian. The question is that you said in one of the streams that if Devon will not fight Denis, then I will fight you now and you are a jerk. And the question was, has your opinion changed after you saw the video on Kiosr?
Artem Morozov: Well, it's clear why we're talking about it. Because there's no place without this trash talk. Although I don't welcome it. I'm very ashamed of myself later when I say such things. And most likely I won't say that anymore. Because I've already agreed. But of course, even then I understood that Devon is a very difficult opponent.
Artem Morozov: To warm up my interest in the fight, I had to speak like this. I understand perfectly well that Devon is a strong man. And with him at the table, you can't do what I say.
Paulo: okay uh again the answer was like this uh listen it's uh you know it's part of the deal and part of uh uh the arm wrestling that uh uh we doing some trash talk sometimes and he doesn't like it but to warm up some interest to uh the following super matches he did he always understood that devon
Paulo: is a very serious opponent and on the table it's not really possible to do to him whatever artyom says but you know anyway he always knew that he's a serious and strong dude yeah does it mean that artem can not beat him um
Artem Morozov: It depends on many factors. If I have a fight with him, I will prepare. And there, as it turns out, of course, I will be determined to win. I will try to do everything for this. But it doesn't just depend on my strength, it also depends on some, I don't know, maybe higher forces. And it depends on the preparation, on the form of Devon himself.
Paulo: so uh yeah i'm saying that uh if if there will be a super match between him and devon uh this will be a very serious preparation he's not gonna just take it uh in you know whatever out of the uh coach uh he will have to
Paulo: really ready and he said it doesn't mean that i cannot win because anybody can win anybody it's very much about some preparation of each side and stuff like that and maybe maybe even more than that uh some different you know uh uh circumstances uh but yeah he said that you know
Engin Terzi: he will require a very serious preparation but who knows you know depends on his preparation arkham's preparation devon preparation i understand there is jeremy coleman hello everyone pablo please ask morozov if his fiancee top rolled pooped and or pressed his heart i'm so happy for them
Paulo: Someone says, please forgive Artem, or his fiancee went to the top and pressed your heart. And then he says, I'm very happy for you, congratulations. Thank you very much. Why do I wear it on my middle finger? Because now I lost a lot of weight and it started to fall off. I had to change clothes. Let's hope that I'll put it back on.
Paulo: Artyom says he put it on a middle finger because he dropped some weight and his finger, his ring finger got smaller. So now you have to put it on a bigger one. But he said I will gain again. Okay. And Arsen, how are you, my friend? How is everything? Yes, yes, my friend. So how is your shape now? How is your shape now?
Engin Terzi: Listen, you are the guests. I'm asking the questions here. I'm joking, joking. No, no, no. You're my friend. First of all, you're my friend. I can ask you about your shape. I know. I know. I'm just joking. My shape is good. I have still one more month. And after one month, we will see. And after one month, I will also rest two weeks. But I'm not feeling that bad. But I don't know. Normal, normal. But we will see. Hopeful. Yeah.
Arsen Liliev: And do you think I have a chance? Oh, I think it will be one of the interesting match for me because you will compete there. And I don't know how. For me, it's a surprise. John surprised me. Now you can surprise all of us.
Engin Terzi: The tough thing is to organize the event. Event is so big. And to organize and also focus is divided. It's very hard. But it's okay. If I wait, then I cannot compete at all. So how do you see that match? He's going to hook me?
Arsen Liliev: I will probably translate it into Russian, so it will be easier for me to explain. I welcome everyone. For example, Artem, I also welcome you. We were not personally acquainted, but we probably know each other.
Arsen Liliev: As for the match against Engin, I don't know what will happen. It's a classic top roll against a very strong hooker. It will definitely be interesting. I don't know, I'll say it again. For me, the maximum Engin was on Nemirov in 2009, if I'm not mistaken. Now I don't know what it is, but we'll see.
Paulo: arsene says that it's uh the most one of the most interesting matches because we have a classic top role against a very very strong hook and this is very very intimidating and interesting and he said that uh the uh prime ending for me was in 2009 at zloty tour and then after that yeah and after that he said i don't know depends on uh your uh form what you're gonna bring this time so very interesting
Engin Terzi: I understand. And how about you? Artem you training? No, my friend. You know why I bring you here, right? I'm going to bring you here and then you will watch it very close. You will be in the atmosphere and then I will make you promise me and then you will go and train.
Arsen Liliev: So, Engin, I want to say one thing. Translate it, please. I'm starting to forget Armrestnik. He's already coming out of my life, absolutely. And at this moment, Engin must definitely appear with some interesting idea that I'm starting to think about. I sleep badly at night. This time he invited me, for which I am grateful to the guests. Therefore, thanks to Engin, Armrestnik will never come out of my life.
Paulo: He said that I almost, almost start to forget in-car wrestling. And I almost get my sleep back.
Paulo: and I slept fine and now for sure you showed up in my life again and you remind and you have all of these cool ideas and now you invited me to this big event which I thank you very much for this but now I cannot sleep again and I cannot you know think straight and I'm thinking about arm wrestling and that's it it's part of my life again I said there are there are some people you know can do big things globally
Arsen Liliev: You are one of them. And then you went to your sleep too early, my friend. It's too early. I'll tell you honestly, Engin, one thing. Today, even after we talked about the invitation to your event, I went today, just in case, made a heart rate, made a cardiogram. I think, I'll see what state my heart is in, if I decide to start training again.
Paulo: He said that after you invited him and after everything was good, today he went to the doctor and check all his heart, his ATG and scan of the heart to make sure that if I will decided to go back, that my heart is good for it. And how was the result?
Arsen Liliev: He said that everything is fine. There is some minor things which everybody will have, so yeah, he's good. Okay, then you understand? You know, but listen, why did you go doctor? Because already here and here. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Good. If you are already there, when you come to Istanbul, you are mine, you know. I will just come in here. Yeah, no escape, no escape. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be here. You know, Arsene will be
Artem Morozov: I didn't even train then. But when I started training, I started watching videos where Arsene fought up to 70. I don't remember, he was very small. And then I watched a video, one of the last ones, probably top 16, where everyone just passed. Top 8. Where his hands were like his waist.
Artem Morozov: Two separate people are two hands. I'm waiting for him to come back. I really hope that this will happen. And the heart, that there are some...
Paulo: okay and arkham saying that uh yeah he was uh not even training when he first time started watching carson and he said that he was following a lot with him and he remembers the one of the last videos with a top eight and he said your arms was
Paulo: this big and they looks like two separate uh human being and he said yeah it's gonna be very very nice if you're gonna come back and he said about those small things in your heart it's just there was a lot of arm wrestling in your heart so come back they'll they're gonna be fixed yeah yeah yeah that that's why it is you know it is just your heart is just like give him arm wrestling give him arm wrestling you know yeah and pulling omer
Engin Terzi: Engin Hocam, your program looking amazing. We are looking forward to East versus West 10. Good night, everyone. Thank you, Ömer. Thank you very much, my friend. Okay, so let's start talk from the last event. Arsene, how did you just talk about like Hermes versus Devon? How did you find that match?
Arsen Liliev: We even discussed it with you. To be honest, as it is, I'm so wrong in my predictions that I'm scared to predict or think. For some reason, I was sure that Hermes would win, but we saw the complete domination of Larratt.
Arsen Liliev: The question is not how he achieved it. Someone says that it was due to the fact that he was captured. Whatever it was, Larratt dominated. I was sure that Hermes would win, at least because I support Hermes. I have long said that Hermes was the next one for me. Unfortunately, as it turned out, so it turned out. In general, in this forecast, I was 100% wrong.
Engin Terzi: Before you translate, Arsene, can you do like this to the camera? Right arm. Like this, yeah. Yeah, looks big, yeah. I think you're a little bit training, no? No, no, no, Andy. В этом году 10 лет. Юбилей, как я перестал тренироваться.
Paulo: Engin, it's 10 years this year, anniversary when he stopped training. Oh, okay, okay, yeah. So he said that, yeah, from now on I'm even afraid to do any predictions because I'm doing so many mistakes and he said I was pretty sure that Hermes was going to win.
Paulo: And he said, we saw domination from Devon. And he said, it doesn't really matter why Devon dominated. Everybody's saying because he was cheating, you know, on the setup and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. He said, it don't matter. But the domination was there. And he said, yeah, I was cheering for Hermes because I thought he's the next one, but didn't happen. So Devon on a very good level. Hey, Arsene.
Engin Terzi: Devon is talking about getting 105 kilo title from Titirgada on Garve and imagine yourself like in your prime shape 105 kilo and against today's Devon if he goes down to 105 kilo who would win? Your best shape or if Devon?
Arsen Liliev: I'll answer you differently, Engin. If I was still fighting, I wouldn't wait for him to go down to 105 kg. I would come after him in the weight that he weighs now. Because Engin knows better than anyone how I liked to fight heavyweights. So I wouldn't wait for him to go down to 105 kg. I would come after him at 130 kg.
Paulo: Engin, he said, I would answer you like this. If I would still arm wrestle up to this time, I would not wait Devon to come back to me to 105. I would go for him. Wow. Yeah, that's good. That's good. You know how much I like to pull super heavy. I want to remind Engin, the very first match I had with heavyweight, I fought Travis at his event.
Paulo: your event the third the very first super match or match with uh super heavies on your event he was pulling travis beijing yeah travis beijing was like a basketball player he shouldn't even come there okay i'll tell him yeah yeah he knows it he knows it he just came for uh
Engin Terzi: patience you know hey he's coming back travis is coming back yeah i hope so i hope he does uh yes anyway so and then now if we if we look at the but you know i said we want action not not not so much you know like in the past i was good and this and this come and prove again listen how old are you how old are you
Engin Terzi: 36. 36. Pat Hashing started armwrestling at your age. You have pulled so many years. How old were you when you started armwrestling? I think at 15. 15.
Engin Terzi: And then when you quit, you were 26. So what I'm just saying, you have incredible base, 11 years of this level of armwrestling base. If you start now, soon it will come back like nothing. You know, there are some capabilities doesn't come after certain age. That is why Tatashinsky is not like incredibly smooth, but he's still very smart, very strong, but not so smooth because he started armwrestling very late.
Paulo: but you have that smoothness because you started early so you start now all you need is just physical power everything is here and here ready my opinion yeah i did my comeback at 38 um
Paulo: Then I didn't fight anymore, from 28 to 38, very little. So seriously returned at 38, but now I'm 43, I'm fighting slowly. You are 43 years old, you look very good. Thank you. Well, not at your level, but still, I'm fighting. Yes, I saw, I saw, yes. So come back.
Paulo: Emgen, I told Arsene that I did my comeback at 38 and I'm 43 right now. I'm still pulling slowly, but I'm pulling. Not on his level, but I'm there. There is one guy, what's his name, let me check again.
Engin Terzi: Rascal Poland, my friends, this event, the upcoming event, is around, I will tell you how much, it is about 30% more expensive to organize than the previous one, my friends. 30% more expensive than the previous one. So we had to really...
Artem Morozov: Artem, did you start training? Yes, I started. Where is your shape now? 50%? 60%? From your maximum. I understand. It's hard for me to say, because I work out biceps, 10kg dumbbells, you know, bodybuilders.
Artem Morozov: If I take, for example, some special exercises, then I don't do it at all. The last time, on Monday, I only did a little push-ups. That is, you don't work with weights, you just drive blood, right? Yes, I drive blood, because against the background of all this, all these injuries have come out, as it were, and the elbows hurt, and the shoulders. Therefore, I am now trying to
Artem Morozov: Artyom, I'm sorry to interrupt. Is it because of the poisoning? Yes. I stopped working out and my weight dropped. And all these pains... Yes, it happens. While there was meat, everything was fine. And now...
Paulo: okay yeah he said that uh he started training a little bit but he cannot uh you know tell you what shape comparison percentage wise because he's working with very light weights he's just doing a blood flow okay he's not pushing his limits he's just making a base
Paulo: yeah he's healing his uh old injuries and he's uh dropped some weight so all the old feels now so he he want to take a little bit of time to heal it and you know blood flow and then he will start as soon as he knows he'll let us know
Engin Terzi: Ali Riza, thank you for your support. I am only beginning at 46 and tennis elbow started flaming up pretty quickly. Any recommendations for old guys or forget about it? My friend, for outside of elbow, I do. Emir, can you bring the flex far? And the other thing as well, the bison.
Engin Terzi: like I would suggest you to do like some uh extension you know with the wrist with the fingers you know like I put sometimes rubber bands and then do this I think you need to train uh the outside of your elbow as well my friends um like I do like these kind of things regularly just not so high tension but this is really and then the back way and then
Engin Terzi: this way in the opposite way like then i hold this way and then i hold this way i do this kind of things this this helps my elbow also this is uh my friend uh joshua augustine grant uh is uh suggested me you hold like this and then you do and then let it go like this and this this this is also good for the uh outside of your elbow to heal up
Engin Terzi: I have one of those, I'm doing that too. Yeah, it helps and it also makes you stronger on the outside. Another super chat, Furious Engin.
Engin Terzi: Fereshteh Ganjavi- Remember, when you were reffing jamboree singers are some big in 2010 remember when you were shocked by arsons flash been on john will it happen if I say came back today what will happen, you know exactly like like if they would pull periods or.
Engin Terzi: Would I be shocked in ref? I don't understand exactly because I wouldn't probably ref at my event. A few times I wanted to do it, but they say it wouldn't be a right thing to ref. But if Arsene comes back, yeah, that's for sure. Arsene, if you come back, eventually you will pull the drone, right? One more time. Come on, man. Come back, you know. Just come on, man. Come on.
Engin Terzi: My friend, we have to discuss this one-on-one in Istanbul. We will talk in Istanbul? Yes, he said, when I come to Istanbul, we will talk about this one-on-one. Okay, one-on-one we will talk, yeah. That's good, that's good. Okay, Artem, what did you think about John versus Alexey Voivodamesh? Artem. I understood, yes. Were you surprised?
Artem Morozov: Yes, it's a big big surprise. I thought Alexey would win, but damn, the corners, of course, were set up. I don't know, I cheered for Alexey, but as practice shows, John is like wine, only better over the years. I noticed such a trend among people who have been in armwrestling for a long time.
Artem Morozov: When they run out of resources, we see that John is not so successful in the hook, he does not fight without a wrist. He has only one movement left, he practices it, and it only gets better and better. This is the top, and few people can pass it. Damn, it was a huge surprise. I was rooting for Alexey, but again, John did not write off from the account.
Artem Morozov: I knew the weak sides, the leaders, but I didn't tell anyone about it. Well, John ate it all up and showed a decent fight. Well, I will hope that Alexey will continue to train and show the level.
Paulo: said that yes this was a very very big surprise and uh he was cheering for alexi and uh uh he said but listen john like uh vine with the age he's getting better somehow and uh he said yeah he maybe lost the ability of being that powerful in the hook but his uh top row and back pressure is very good and he's uh training that and it's getting better and better
Paulo: and he said yeah i knew that alexi have some holes in his arm but i didn't tell anybody but john figured that out on a table pretty fast and uh it was a very good surprise win uh he said i thought that john may do something i did not completely you know
Paulo: with Jad's abilities aside, but he said, I was surprised that he did it. And he said, but I hope that Alexey will still do his comeback and he will still be trained. At the table, Alexey was before the match, during the match, after the match, Alexey was very respectful to John.
Engin Terzi: and he didn't lose that respect at all from beginning to the end after the match it was all steady same respect it didn't change like and i really like that yeah and arsene how did you think about uh what did you think about the alexi versus john match who did you think that was gonna win and what do you think about the match
Arsen Liliev: First of all, I was rooting for Alexey Voivod. I was 100% sure that he would win. But if you look at it this way, I always like how Denis approaches it. Denis says, I'm in shape when I weigh 135 kg.
Arsen Liliev: Alexey in shape, when he weighs 120 kg. 111 kg is still not enough for him, apparently. He can be in good physical shape as a whole, but apparently strength indicators and strength at the table require more weight. And so, of course, there is little to say about the surprise. I was sure that Alexey would win, and I cheered for him, of course.
Arsen Liliev: And John, a lot of people have already said about him, how cool he is. I don't know. We'll see. If Engin convinces me, then I definitely want to play this match. Because I won a good, healthy John in 2010. Let's try to fight the old man.
Paulo: uh yeah arsene said that uh yeah it was uh he said i was cheering for alexis for sure and he said that yes big surprise uh i was almost 100 sure that alexis gonna win this match but it didn't happen and he said yeah john surprised us
Paulo: and also he said that he very much liked the approach of dennis ziplinkov to his uh physical form and he is saying that if i am over 135 kg that means i'm in a good shape and good form for a super match and he said probably the same works with alexi he needs to be a little over 120 to be powerful enough to pull on a table properly
Paulo: he also says that uh uh yeah if engine will convince me to come back to arm wrestling I really really want this match because in 2010 I was pulling Prime basically Prime John and I won and he said yeah absolutely now I I want to try it again with the older John why not guys no
Engin Terzi: Endo 2024, it will not be $30 or something. We are not going over $19.99, my friends. That was just remember. We always try to increase the production. And also, I will tell you this way. Yes, first pay-per-view was...
Engin Terzi: the whole cost was $80,000. This time it is almost four times more. So that's all I will say. I don't want to go into the details, but almost four times more expensive this event.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, if you focus on the next card that is upcoming and we have many matches, let's start with Artem. Artem, you know Frank Lamparelli, right? Yes, I know. What do you think about his set against Matt Mask? What do you expect from this match?
Artem Morozov: I think he's in very good shape now. Pavlo will confirm it. Sergei Kalinichenko fought great with him, despite the fact that he lost. I watched him fight with Ron Abbott. He did a great job. I like how Matt Mask looks and fights.
Paulo: I think he will win this time as well. Maybe not a dry one, but he will win. He said that he very much likes the shape and form of the Mad Mask right now. He said he was following and he saw his matches with Kalinchenko. He was, but he said incredible match with Rambert.
Paulo: great shape so he said i very much like how he looks like and how he performs lately so he thinks that uh he will take this win he said maybe not three zero maybe a different uh score but uh he believes that the mess can win this one um arsene about this much yeah yeah frank lamparelli
Engin Terzi: You know the Italian puller, great top roller. I kind of think that they are like Frank and Matt Mask is like similar shape, similar style, you know?
Arsen Liliev: Well, I'm not very familiar with the Italian fighter. To be honest, I don't remember how he fights at all. As for Matt Mask, his usual fight is a lot of energy, a lot of passion, but I don't think he has a lot of strength. I can't say anything about this match. Who wins, wins for health.
Paulo: he said that i cannot tell much he said but matt mask have lots of energy and uh probably not enough power uh but he said i cannot predict this because he is not following uh for the frank and he doesn't really know his style and how he will i understand and and and how about uh sasho versus artentino left arm arto
Artem Morozov: Here, I think that, like at the World Championship, in my opinion, when it was in 2021, I think that Artem will win. Because... Because Sasho started to play with vegetarianism. Artem, he's charged for victory, I think. He's now scored. If they don't have a weight limit, then I think that Artem...
Artem Morozov: will win easily. Well, not easily, that is, he will hook him and, taking into account his ability to use different techniques during the fight, that is, he can jump up and from there somehow jump into the triceps, and from the triceps he can somehow jump up again. It turns out very beautifully. I think it's not easy, but Artem will still win.
Paulo: Yeah, Artem says that Taitinov probably will win.
Paulo: He believes that Sasho start playing with vegetarian stuff and stop eating meat, and Artyom believes that that will not play a good role. And he said that Artyom is very technical, I know, and he can use different styles and different pulling and transitioning smooth and fast on a table, and because of that,
Artem Morozov: He believes that he will take a win. Not easy, but will take a win. Can I continue for a second? Again, why did I focus on vegetarianism? Because, damn, now sports, given the different supplements, vitamins, are not in place. And here you have to eat.
Artem Morozov: a cow a day and weigh a lot to dominate over all. It's hard to do it on vegetables, although it's very cool and useful.
Paulo: Artem made a little statement here that he said that sport is not sitting at the same place and because of all of the supplements and all of our vitamins and different farm support, we need more food, consuming more food. He's joking about you have to basically eat the whole cow a day to be top performance. But he said...
Engin Terzi: vegetables is very healthy and it's very good for your health yeah but top performance athlete he believes it's not a good idea but he's saying that basically we need to eat red meat a lot of red meat he says yeah and Arsene how do you think it's Artem Taino versus Sasho last time they met it was 20 21 walls waffles and uh Artem Artem Taino won
Engin Terzi: Um, he tried to top roll him and then, you know, Sasho was in this position, long battle, and then suddenly Artem tried the shoulder pressure and then he beat him. And in the final match, he didn't allow him to sleep. He just right away while Sasho was trying to sleep, he got pinned and this was the result. But I remember before they pulled the first match.
Arsen Liliev: I think Pylamen and Sasho had a long left arm match right before their rounds. How do you see this match?
Arsen Liliev: He has a different form, different hands, different muscles. He fights in all directions. I really like the way he fights now, his form. I think he will have the same domination as Arata with Hermes. I don't think there will be an equal and interesting fight. I think Artem will win for sure.
Paulo: Arsene saying that he would a little bit disagree with Arkham and he believes that Arkham Taynov will win relatively easy with the domination. And he said he saw him back in July, not too long ago, and he said he looks incredible, completely different muscles, completely different form. He said with his ability of pulling in all the styles and transitioning, he will pull the very dominant win.
Engin Terzi: Interesting, yeah. Okay, okay. So, let's go to another match. And what do you think about Irina Gladkaya versus Fia Ayseg, Arsene? Oh, I don't know what their form is now. They used to be very cool athletes. Well, of course, they're still fighting. It's hard for me to say.
Arsen Liliev: I will always root for Ira. I hope she wins. But as far as I remember, the Swedes have always been dangerous. Especially for Russian athletes. There were problems with Irina Makeeva. There were problems with Ira Gladko. So I don't even know. It's hard for me to answer. At least... Yes.
Paulo: Arsene says that he cannot predict it very well, but he said that they both are very, very high-level pullers, and it depends on the form. And he said that Swedish girls always was a problem for Russian girls.
Paulo: he for sure will ensure a cheer for irina but he said that uh you know on this card ladies matches will be the same interesting as a man's matches and he's very interesting cannot wait to see this match yeah me too it's gonna be a great one i believe so um okay let's go to
Artem Morozov: Ivan Ivan Matyushenko vs. Kamil Jablonski. Artem? I think Ivan will win for sure. I follow Kamil on Instagram. We've seen each other. I see how he fights. It won't be a problem for Ivan. Kamil has just started.
Artem Morozov: Let's say, he still has everything ahead, but Ivan will win.
Paulo: Artem is saying that he's following Kamil Jablonski and he's watching his style. But he said that it's not going to be a problem for Ivan Matyushenko because of his experience. He's going to pull a win. But he said, listen, Kamil is very young still and he will progress and everything is in front of him. But this time, it's not. Next time.
Engin Terzi: And what do you think, Arsene? Ivan Ivan Matyushenko had been your teammate for many years and he's gonna put against Kamil Jablonski. Kamil Jablonski just defeated Dave Chaffee 3-0. What do you think?
Arsen Liliev: To be honest, with the same experience as Ivan, with the same strength, with so many years of fighting and winning, I don't think I will have any special chances. Ivan is at a slightly different level.
Paulo: He said that, yeah, with the luggage that Ivan Ivan Matyushenko has, with all these years and, you know, all this experience, Kamil doesn't have much chances to win, unfortunately. But he said, yeah, I think that Ivan Ivan Matyushenko will win, convincingly. Engin, sorry, sorry. Yeah. Engin, sorry. Pavel, I think Kamil needs, like in the film Hulk,
Artem Morozov: Artyom says that like in the movie Hulk there was his
Paulo: same name camille blonsky or camillia blonsky who is transformed to some big animal and if he will do that then he will have a chance interesting perspective yeah anyway so uh arsene also you know these two names very well you want to know my opinion about camille
Paulo: i saw it i saw the match between camille and dave oh yeah yeah yeah you tell us your opinion yeah yeah sorry about it i was there yeah and uh i know ivan matushenko i've been following him for a long time and there is only little if ivan needs to be on fire speed fire camille is very very fast and if he will take
Paulo: five centimeters off the center of the Ivan Matyushenko, it's maybe a big, big problem for Ivan Matyushenko. Yeah, it's going to be a very interesting match. And it's very well maybe that it's not going to be 3-0. Kamil may... Kamil have a very good chance, let's put it this way. If Ivan will not fire up at the goal, it's maybe... Yes, that's correct. And only like three months before that match,
Engin Terzi: Kamil took third place at the East versus West qualification in Istanbul. Yes. And he lost to Hutchings from Ireland, who lost against Brett Grundy. Yeah. And he also lost to Kalinisenko. But then... Styles make matches. What's that? Styles make matches. Yeah, this is what I am also saying. But...
Engin Terzi: because of his injuries and everything, you know, like, and he goes like this way, Shafi now, while Ivan is hitting on pronators, you know. I think Ivan's style is more difficult for Kamil than a top roll. When you top roll, you know, you know, it is, you are more vulnerable to the press, you know, but we will see.
Engin Terzi: he needs to be fast if he will be slow i mean very very fast yeah camel is very fast and matushenko is also i think matushenko has the maybe the fastest wrist like his you know his wrist did you see his match with david araboli yes
Arsen Liliev: I mean, people made it like 0.25 feet. It was still like this, you know. It's very fast. Right, Arsene? Even wrist is very fast. I absolutely agree with Engin, yes. Because I fought with Vanya, probably, three or four times. Do you understand exactly what the whole problem is? That is, it probably works a little differently, this speed in armwrestling, right? I had some.
Arsen Liliev: He exploded with his whole body, I don't know. And Engin was right to say that he has some kind of brush. Even if I was stronger than him, he still went into the groove. He is very sensitive to the brush. If he doesn't even insert the bone deeply, the ligaments, then the brush still manages to work.
Paulo: Yeah, Arsene agrees with you in that his wrist said, maybe I was fast too, but I was explosive with the whole body. But Ivan Matyushenko's wrist twisting is very fast and he even put Arsene in a hook when he was pulling. Yeah, I think he even beat Lalecin in a left-arm supermatch two rounds. I think he lost 4-2 or something. It's very, very hard to hook Lalecin.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so Arsene, is Sarah Backman versus Egle White-Coutet? People may not know, but these two ladies pulled exactly 10 years ago at my event when Krasimir and John also pulled. And then at that time, Egle beat Sarah 5-0. But that Sarah and this Sarah are different Sarah. So now I am expecting very close match. How do you see that, Arsene?
Arsen Liliev: Do you know what it looks like now? Do you remember how it used to be? Who is stronger, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone? Here it will be about the same. Because for me, Egle was number one in the world of armwrestling when I fought. Sarah added from year to year, from year to year. But the last time I see Sarah, it's a completely different level. And I don't know what form Egle will be in.
Arsen Liliev: It will be a very close match. For some reason, it seems to me that it will be a long match that is not characteristic of women's wrestling. And I am very interested in the female card.
Paulo: Yeah, Arsene said that like 10 years ago he would say Egle because Egle was for him like number one in female arm wrestlers. But right now he said Sarah was progressing all the time constantly and she's a completely different Sarah right now. And he said that he's waiting for that super match and he wants to see it because...
Paulo: he think that it's going to be very very close match and it's most likely going to be a prolongated match which is not uh not usual for female arm wrestling that's probably going to be a lot
Artem Morozov: anyway so um um just tell honestly tell honestly don't be nice um
Artem Morozov: I watched the fight. Davit Samushia fought Daniel Prokopchuk. It was difficult for Davit in the first round, but knowing what height you have, I say again, 60 to 40 in your favor.
Paulo: Yeah, the answer was like that, that Engin, knowing your experience, I would say that probably 60-40 to you. And he said, I have a reasoning, because when I was watching his Davit Samushia supermatch with Daniel, he said the first match he was struggling. And knowing how good your top role is, he said, I really believe that it's 60-40 to you. I understand.
Paulo: And you, Arsene, 50-50 or 60-40 for Samushia? If you tell me honestly how much you appreciate your form, I'll tell you who wins. And if you will honestly tell what your form is, how you feel, then he will answer honestly who he thinks is going to win.
Paulo: I am hoping to be a little bit more than 90% of my best. But not now, not now. How is your injury? Do you feel them still or are they healed?
Engin Terzi: Arsene is making like a professional, you know, population. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And yeah, injuries are better. I am hoping to not to have like the chronic injury is always there. It doesn't go, but you can make the inflammation down. I am hoping that at the match, during the match,
Engin Terzi: I will not have pain because I think I will take ibuprofen. Like I cannot really like force myself a hundred percent, but carefully, carefully, I'm close, you know, but just, I can say that my guess is I will be between 90 to 95%, but the only problem, I don't know how my bicep, inner bicep, you know, you remember Arthur? Yes, yes, yes.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, so I don't know about that. I don't know how it will be. Because I didn't have surgery, I made a mistake, but I will go to America for the stem cell therapy. And hopefully it will be better. But we will see, you know. Yeah. In general, everything I've heard, everything I've heard, I'm the same, I mean, I treat both athletes well, but what Engin says, Davido, is a big problem.
Engin Terzi: everything that he hear right now and he said i love both of the athletes but uh what i hear they would have a big big problems yeah this is the plan yeah that that interesting thing is that um like i talked like two guys at pool i shouldn't say this but i'm gonna say it i hope they will forgive me but two guys at pool samusha both daniel prokopchuk and uh uh they think i'm gonna win
Engin Terzi: But I don't see it that way. But Arsene, taking Samushia's wrist, is it going to be a solution? I don't think it's impossible.
Arsen Liliev: Moreover, Engin has such a top, it is quite unpleasant. You know how? Now I will try to explain. If Aletin or Lalitina, I apologize if I said it wrong. That is, how is it with him? He punched, and Engin's top is a little different. He constantly loads his fingers. That is, even if he is hooked somewhere, if he does not even reach the pillow at once, then the constant load on the fingers goes to the wrist. And still, it is always difficult to fight such a top with a hook.
Paulo: engine arsene says that your top wall and your top is very unpleasant thing it's very bad
Paulo: in a meaning that you always loading the fingers very bad. And he said that he doesn't see a big problem for you to take his wrist because you, even if you're not a bit all the way to the pad, you will load the fingers constantly. And this is very, very different from, let's say, Lallytons.
Paulo: where you can't put constant pressure and uh any anybody tight or hook it's very bad my question my question just say that i top roll him will it be enough to pin him
Arsen Liliev: I don't know. I don't think it's a problem. I think the most difficult part of this match will be to deal with his wrist. But if he passes his wrist, if he will fight without a wrist, I think it will not be the most difficult part for Engin. The most difficult will be the starting position and whether he will be able to load enough wrist and fingers.
Paulo: Yeah, I agree. Arsene saying that he doesn't think that it's going to be the toughest part of the match. He really thinks the toughest part of the match is the starting position and actually taking his wrist out. As soon as you do that, then he doesn't see any problems. Okay, we will see. We will see. Anyways, so then let's go to do another match. How about...
Artem Morozov: Rustam Babaiev vs. Irakli Zirakashvili at 95 kg. Artem. Well, I... I... In fact, after the fight, after all the fights, the last one, Irakli, it's hard for me to make predictions because Davit...
Artem Morozov: I don't know if his arm has recovered after the injury. I'm afraid to predict this fight.
Paulo: Artiom is not sure about this particular one because there are too many factors. First of all, how Iraqis perform against Ongarbaev. And second of all, the injury of Babaiev. He said, you know, it's like unpredictable. He said, I don't know. I don't know. Ongarbaev beat him in the top row.
Engin Terzi: rushtam can top roll still top roll but rushtam is basically going inside um krasimir tried to hook directly it wasn't successful um so i i kind of think that it is more possible to top roll him than hook with him it's not that easy to hook him but rushtam also very very hard to take his risks and i think rushtam's chat is healed up it's okay i think
Engin Terzi: And Irakli is usually, like, even when he pulls 105 kilos, he is like 99 kilos, 100 kilos. So those four kilos, like, he's really pushing himself to be light heavyweight. In fact, he's just like easily 95 kilos. I don't think he will lose any power. And Arsen, how do you see this match? Artyom, do you understand what he's saying?
Arsen Liliev: I really like this match. I really like it because of the style. I don't know, when we were fighting,
Arsen Liliev: Rustam was such a perfect machine that could enter any club. But once Rustam Engin remembers this match. Such an athlete was Shakman Afumar, who won it very easily and confidently at the European Championship. And the most amazing thing is that in this match such similar styles, the same hand, some kind of long, dry, hard.
Arsen Liliev: I think the style is very interesting, because Rustam, I say again, Rustam ideally went into the hook and goes in. The only one who had problems with him is exactly the same technique as Irakli. I'm very interested.
Engin Terzi: With the left arm he could, but right arm, I think, was someone.
Paulo: so so basically i'm saying is uh that yeah rustam is a almost perfect machine for hooking almost anybody but he remembered uh uh
Paulo: that very similar arms he has a problem with so he is like very interested in looking into this match because he believes that it's maybe stylistically approximately the same and uh it's going to be very very interesting to see how they're going to perform how do you see that much Paulo
Paulo: I think that, yeah, Irakli because of the stylistically may prevent Rustam to go into the deep hook. If Rustam goes into the deep hook, he will win. But I believe it's maybe something like Tim Bresnan and Rustam Babaiev. I understand the size differences. But when Tim Bresnan was preventing Rustam to go into the hook,
Paulo: and keep his wrist basically flat. It was a match. So yeah, and it's a very interesting match. I cannot predict but I believe that
Paulo: uh i believe that iraq will have a very very slight uh you know better chance yeah maybe like very very shortly somebody asked there you know why don't you ask you paulo about engine and sunshine engine you're gonna crush him
Engin Terzi: Oh, no, no, no. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. You all see that I'm right. Yeah, 3-0. But I would like to, but we will see. That's the plan, but... And 3-0 with very fast pins, all of them, all three. Okay, I didn't ask that. Okay, let's go. Hutchings versus Ongarbaev. Let's go Artur Morozov. 105 kilo world title match.
Artem Morozov: As you already said, Hutchings started armwrestling late, so he lacks a little technique. I know how smart Ongarbaev is, and he proved it in the fight with John and Irakli. I still think that Ongarbaev will win here, even if not easily.
Artem Morozov: but he will find the key.
Paulo: Artyom's saying that because, as you said, and Hutchings started armwrestling pretty late, he doesn't have that, you know, control and technique in his wrist and hand. And Ongarbaev proved us how smart he is on the table by winning Georgi, by winning Jan Brzenk. So he thinks that he will find that key to Hutchings and he's going to win.
Arsen Liliev: But I'm expecting a war there, a war, a big war. And Arsene, you, on Garvey vs. Hutchings? I've heard Anguino, I don't think I understand anything at all. I think it's the most uninteresting match in terms of the fact that that Hutchings is probably the most positive of the American team, who I often fought with in my heart.
Arsen Liliev: But at the same time, he is absolutely unprepared to fight with the top fighters, so to speak. I'll say it again, if there was a competition where those who fight in the hook fight together, then he would probably have been a ten-year world champion in the fight in the hook. And with such athletes as Ongarbaev, unfortunately, to my great regret, because I treat Todd very well, he has no chances.
Paulo: So, yeah, Arsene saying that he likes Todd Hutchings very much. And he said if there will be a separate tournament for hook arm wrestling, he would be a champion and number one in the world for sure. But he said that he has some problems with top rollers. And he said that he basically doesn't have a chance against Todd Hutchings.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but Arsene, he said that about the top rollers, in the past he was trying to catch the top rollers. Now he's a little bit different. When top rollers go that way out, he also pronates and he does the side pressure. This is how he beat Irakli. And this is only a little bit more than one month ago, one and a half months ago, he beat John.
Engin Terzi: know john beat alexi and then todd beat uh john with the side pressure with him he doesn't go like this against the tuples anymore if tuple is going that way he is also pronating this way and then because of his side pressure is so strong he still beats them not like this but like with pronation and press like this
Arsen Liliev: Do you understand what I'm trying to say? Yes, yes, yes. I understand everything. But I don't think I agree with this at all. Because, first of all, Ongarbaev is such an athlete. I've seen so many of his fights. He won't let it happen. If he has already caught some kind of domination, that is, if Hutchings has already left like this, he won't let it happen.
Arsen Liliev: If he carries him here, he will suffer, the hand is long. I often make mistakes with my predictions, but I think that in this fight I would be more worried about that touching. He is a very kind person, but unfortunately, it seems to me that it will not work out. Not that there will be a war, but it will be 3-0.
Paulo: he said that he likes that hutchins and he even want to cheer for him but uh yeah i'm gonna buy if he's so smart he will he will dominate what you say yeah he will he will not let hutchins even move backwards if he will uh take his wrist even a little bit in any positions he said that this is over he believes that he said i love that hutchins he's very close arm wrestler to me but he said unfortunately i believe that there is no chance
Engin Terzi: And what's your opinion? Yeah, I would agree probably with Artyom and Arsen. I love that, but I believe in this situation, this is a pretty big gap. I don't know, because sometimes the power, so much power can really make you out of your game to play technique or this and this when there is so much power.
Paulo: So I don't know about that, we will see. I don't think that Todd Hutchings' power is overpowering Ongarbaev that much. It's maybe more, and you're right, but I don't think it's that much more to overpower that perfect arrest machine. Yeah, the people sometimes I see, this guy is going to...
Engin Terzi: Some people don't know the word destroy. If a match is taking like 15, 20, 30 seconds, that match is not destroyed. It's even the match that one guy won, you know. This destroying is for me is this, or just take this. This is destroying, you know. But when there is a war at the table, and then just because the score is 3-0, it's not destroying. It's a big war, you know. Lost match. Anyway, so let's go. This is important, Artem. Very important.
Artem Morozov: zaur versus georgie go ahead oh блин поборошусь с георгием и зная да и я еще смотрел их поединок в 21 году да и мне кажется что георгий 60
Artem Morozov: I think he'll win 70-30. But Zaur is pretty strong. But not as tough as Georgi. Zaur has a lot of strength, which he trained on iron. And Georgi has just a lot of experience in wrestling, first of all, because he's constantly sparring. He does sparring twice a day. And he's very heavy. And he just knows how to fight.
Paulo: So that's my prediction. Let no one be offended by me. Artem says that... Sorry, everybody, nothing personal, but after I pulled Georgi and after he saw the match in 2021, he said that he thinks that probably 60-40 or even 70-30 to Georgi. But he said that Zaur have a huge, huge power.
Paulo: which he trained with uh iron was you know in the gym uh but uh uh georgie has a uh huge pooling experience and he's uh you know practicing like twice a day and he's all also heavy and he believes that uh he will win like with a pretty big gap like he said like 64 or 78 and you are saying
Arsen Liliev: Yes, it's a very interesting card. Very interesting. I don't know. First of all, you can't underestimate Zawra. He's probably the favorite in this match. The only thing is that he had an injury. And at the last tournament in Vladikavkaz, when they fought, he didn't fully recover. Not that he didn't fully recover. It seemed to me that he didn't recover well after the injury.
Arsen Liliev: And I saw when he was in the best form, when he just killed Vitalik, Silaev on the table, he dominated completely. Therefore, it is difficult for me to say. It seems to me that if Zaur will be completely recovered from his injury and will be in the form in which he was, then it seems to me that, most likely, 70 to 30 in his favor.
Paulo: Arsene saying that, listen, we don't know, but it looks like Zaur is under, he did not heal fully.
Paulo: the previous measures because when he was in his prime big form before the injury he said he just he just you know dominated on the table everybody survived london everybody so saying it's a huge power and he believes that if by that time zao will be at the 100 form after the injury he will completely recover he will pretty convincingly like 70 to 30.
Engin Terzi: If he's totally recovered, he's ready, he's going to win. Whenever I asked him if he would pull Georgi, he said Engin. Georgi, to me, he said stronger than both Devon and Hermes. It's not my opinion. This is what he said. So he is ranking Georgi. Some people underestimate Georgi, but Zaur is also taking him very seriously. And how do you see this match?
Paulo: very interesting match i want to see it but uh as uh yeah if let's say he's 100 100 recovered after his injury uh the problem is that zao basically have his one move
Paulo: very strong but it's one move and uh georgie's wrist wrist known it's not been taken and he's very fast and heavy too so i believe that georgie will be able to stop the match maybe not exactly at the center of the table maybe a little bit out but still with a you know cup twist and if that's happening
Artem Morozov: it's a big problem for us all he will not be able to finish it so yeah i i want to see the match i i i believe i believe that uh georgie will take it but very very close okay john bersing versus sascha artyom
Artem Morozov: not very successful. He has a very long angle. And here John, I think, will dominate.
Paulo: Yeah, he said that Jan most likely will dominate because Sasho had some injury in his right arm and his angle was not as close as it used to be. It's a little bit, you know, a little longer. So he said that probably Jan will dominate in this one on the right arm. I asked Sasho, he said he's in great shape, you know. He said he doesn't have any problems. He's in very good shape. This was Sasho. Sasho wouldn't take a match if he doesn't feel good.
Arsen Liliev: Sasho takes a match if he's ready, for sure. And you, Arsene, how do you see that one?
Arsen Liliev: But I still believe and hope that Sasho will really be in his best shape and he will be able to catch him somewhere and we will see a good, beautiful match. And I would like to see John in a deep hook. Does he know how? Does he still remember this thing? I don't know. I don't know. If you want to hear my opinion, remember what John did to Zloev in the hook?
Paulo: Okay, this is yours or Arsene's? Oh, this is mine. Yeah, Arsene's saying, yeah, I was waiting for you. Arsene's saying that he wants to see, he thinks that Jan will probably dominate, but if Sasho will pitch him anywhere, even a little bit from a pad, that's going to be a big problem for Jan. But he said that's maybe a very, very great match and Arsene wants to see Jan pulling in the hook.
Paulo: So what's the prediction? Who do you think will win?
Arsen Liliev: I still think about winning John, but it was important for me to hear that Sasho doesn't accept challenges if he's not 100% ready. It will be interesting, really. Sasho with his short levers and deep hook, it's a problem for everyone.
Paulo: Yeah, he said that, first of all, he likes very much that Sashaw is not taking the matches if he's not in his best shape, and this is very respectful. Arsene still thinks that Jan is probably going to win, but with his shorter arms and short levers, it's a big problem for anybody when Sashaw goes inside in the hook. So he very much likes to see the match. And your opinion?
Paulo: my opinion that uh i don't know did did we did see what john did to hajim to the life i believe that he had a little bit different you know has good hook
Engin Terzi: His hook inability is not as good as Sasho. Like, Plem and Dimitro, time to time, topple Haji. Yes, yes, yes. Tautiev topple Haji. Yanis topple Haji. In the past, I topple Haji, you know. Like, Haji is great, but sometimes lose risk. Sasho doesn't lose. Also, Ajumma Zole, when he pulled against John, his hook was hurt, so he was trying to top roll.
Engin Terzi: So trying to top roll John is not like, it's not like this. I just wanted no criticism. Devon't get me wrong, Paul. Just share an info. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I never bid against John. I mean, if he will be in a okay shape, close to 85%, he will, you know, he will. Yeah. Okay. Now let's go to the big one and then finish. Artem Morozov.
Artem Morozov: Despite the fact that Denis and I are in the same team, I think that knowing how Denis can prepare,
Artem Morozov: I can't say that I bet 100% on Denis, but 80-20% I think Denis will win. First of all, he has a huge arm that can't be hugged. I don't know how long a finger is needed. Secondly, Rata also has his own problems. I compare my sparring with Denis. At the beginning of the summer,
Artem Morozov: And at the end of the summer, when he came to visit us. These are two different people. Denis, he gained a lot and gains every day. Therefore, here, despite the fact that we are in the same team, I still give Denis an objective preference.
Paulo: Artem saying that he's trying to be very objective. And yes, he said, I agree, I'm the same team. But besides the point, he said that Denis has huge hands, huge arms, and his abilities of peaking to a special event.
Paulo: is amazing and he said that he saw him in the beginning of the summer and then in the end of the summer it's like meeting completely two different persons okay i'm gonna talk to you here okay you tell first i will ask him another question and he said that it's like uh in larat have his issues with um everybody have it on these levels but uh archon believing that denise will win was like
Engin Terzi: What's that? With what? 80-20. 80-20. Okay. The question to Artyom. Artyom, you said beginning of the summer and end of the summer, two different, Denis, you are saying, but don't get me wrong. Beginning of the summer, you didn't have any stomach problem. We saw you in Dubai. You were like a superman.
Engin Terzi: End of the summer was after your stomach problem, you lost so much weight, you get smaller. And do you think that it is right, objective way to compare your shape from beginning of summer to the end of the summer to judge Denis' shape?
Artem Morozov: after the illness, fought with me. That's why I already understood then that I can't evaluate my fight. I can't say that I'm so strong that I won Denis's sparring. Then I got sick, but at the same time I was treated and rested well. That is, there was so much
Artem Morozov: In the first fights, when we just stood at the table, when Denis was still not tired, he did not fight with the whole crowd, there was such a tough and strong hand that it seems to me that I would not even hold it with two hands. So much. That is, he began to train, began to fight and began to gain weight.
Paulo: And Artyom saying that, yes, you're right, I was sick, but he said, it's still a huge difference. He said, when I've been trying to repair and take care of my issues, I was arrested too. But he said at the end of the summer, when he held Denis's hand, it was so stiff and hard in the middle of the table that Artyom really think that he wouldn't move it even with two hands.
Arsen Liliev: I understand. I understand. And Arsene, what do you think? I'm so confident in Denis. I'm so confident. It's not that I don't give up, like Artyom, 20 to 80. 100% Denis will be here. It's me.
Arsen Liliev: I'm telling you for sure. I always watch the fans of Larratt. Larratt is our media personality, our armwrestling face. But let's not forget that he is a media personality and a grand champion.
Arsen Liliev: If Denis is in shape, it's incredible. I know that if Denis goes somewhere, if he prepares for some kind of competition, for some kind of athlete, then he will not reach 100-200 percent. Therefore, I do not even allow a chance that there will be some kind of resistance. The victory of Denis is unconditional.
Paulo: Arsene believing that 100%, not 80-20, but 100% Denis will win, convincingly. And he said, yes, Devon is our armwrestling media, social media presence. Ambassador, ambassador, yeah.
Paulo: yeah ambassador but uh he said dennis is a real champion he uh his uh our preparation process to actual match or tournament is incredible and he will not be a hundred percent he will be two hundred percent at the moment he's pulling he said not even a question hundred percent guaranteed dennis will win this one wow but arson do you realize that
Arsen Liliev: Denis today is not the Denis 10 years ago. I agree, yes. But imagine, if now Denis will have 70% of what Denis was in the prime, it will be enough for him to win any Valorant.
Artem Morozov: he said that yes i understand that but if dennis will be 70 percent of what he was in his prime that's going to be more than enough to win larat today's or any larat sorry sorry sorry
Artem Morozov: I gave him 20% so that he would get to the fight and nothing would happen to him. So that he wouldn't fight with Gein again, lose and fall into depression. I give him 20% so that he would get to the fight.
Paulo: uh yeah artem saying i'm sorry i'm sorry i have something to say and he said i gave to larat this 20 not because i think he have him but because of the respect to him that's first of all and second of all to make sure that he will show up to this super match
Paulo: Wow, you guys are really, really cool. I missed, I wailed, Pavel, what was there? I couldn't pick it up. Artem says, I gave him 20% not because I think he has 20%, but first of all, out of respect for him, and secondly, in order not to scare him, so that he would at least draw on this picture.
Arsen Liliev: No, I also respect him immensely. He's really the ambassador of our sport. But we're here to express our real, objective opinion. I'm not saying that I'm rooting for this or that. I'm really saying that. In some fights, I can root for one athlete, like for Toto Hutchings, but at the same time, I give the right to the opponent.
Arsen Liliev: I'm not saying that we're not trying to embarrass anybody because he said
Paulo: respect devon a lot and he's ambassador of our sport without any questions but he said if uh if you're asking our real opinion that's the real opinion that's it he said yeah i'm i'm cheering for todd hutchins let's say in a match with on grabio but i'm telling you the truth what i think and he said my humble opinion probably uh have a right to exist because of how many years i've been in the sport today today i talk with bob kent
Engin Terzi: and and i asked him you know like like uh in the training videos david daddy cam puts uh dennis to like such positions you know here and from here he recovers and beats him and like like i see like this is not really like stonewall you know like you understand at the center of the table and just looking at his face or something and he said that
Engin Terzi: He is, Denis is training super hard and he's with the waist and everything. He said like he is all the time very tired, you know, while Davit Darikyan doesn't have a match to like really. So he is not like he is more much pressure, you know, every time they train together. So I really don't know. I mean, Arsene, you said that you predicted that Hermes was going to win against Devon, right?
Engin Terzi: yes yes yes yes yeah are you think that there is a possibility that this time you will be wrong as well or not no no no it's not not possible for this match i think okay okay because because i don't know where dennis is i really don't know if prying dennis really really like the one that you hit you hit the wall remember
Arsen Liliev: Yes, I'm different. When I fought Denis for the first time, not only did my arms hurt, but also my back, my legs, my whole body. I definitely remember my prime Denis. I very well remember the prime Denis. After the match with him, it's not only arms that was hurt, my back was hurt, my legs were hurt, everything. He told me that he pulled with him and then he said that
Engin Terzi: next day everyone was hurting i said was it a tough match he said no it was like one second you know he said arsene said that he he was in best shape of his life he went there to win and he said he hit him like as hard as ever like he never hit anyone do you remember the match he hit and then he did like this it was so funny to hear that yeah anyways thank you very much i took one and a half hour and
Engin Terzi: Thank you. And your opinion, Paolo, your opinion. Come on, you are not going to escape from that. I never grip up with Denis.
Paulo: We are friends, and we've been talking a lot, but I never grip up with Denis. But I did grip up not too long ago at your event here at the finals, American finals for East versus West. It was three months ago. I grip up with Devon while he was fresh. Left arm, let's say, manageable, and I can move it. Right arm, he just put it on the table and closed the grip. He did not do any movements.
Paulo: he kept it at the center and i i am relatively strong by lifting weights i cannot move at all so i believe that this is going to be an interesting match i also believe that dennis is a favorite but i will i would not give him a hundred percent for sure i would probably give to dennis 55.
Engin Terzi: So you are saying, yeah, that is interesting that, you know, because we don't know where Denis is. He doesn't look as big as before. We know that like he is not like whenever he beat John, yeah, he had the full control, but still he wasn't. So I really don't know where he will be next event. So that is a big question. But whatever I see the training with Dadikyan,
Engin Terzi: and then whenever i see uh devon last performances like for me like best i can give is 50 50. this is like i shouldn't say it but i say it because 50 50 i say when it is 50 50 i say there's an organizer so i i think they will be incredible match because i will tell you something dennis
Engin Terzi: has also incredible endurance this guy doesn't get tired as well and then he repeats you know more and more and more he can pull you know like like Devon has incredible endurance but also in his house is also incredible yes yes if the match stopped it doesn't mean anything yet so yeah yeah that's what I say if the match stops it doesn't mean anything for either side you know
Paulo: Why am I giving that 5% to Denis? I would say the same as you 50-50. But why would I give it 5% to Denis? Because his body power is more than Devon's. Devon's arm is very, very strong. Yes. Wrist control, incredible. Yes, everything's perfect. But his overall body power is not on the level of Denis. And I believe that Denis probably 15% to 20% overall stronger
Paulo: human being then devon larrett and at this moment i believe that that will equalize or nebulate devon's abilities of technique at the table or table like which is dennis's very high tube but uh yeah that's why i believe that dennis have a slight five percent but i understand i understand arsene thank you very much my friends and thank you thank you see you next month
Engin Terzi: artom thank you very very much and then we cannot wait to see you east versus west without artom no good we need artom thank you so much thank you so much yeah yeah we miss you and paulo as always my friend you're incredible you know just like i don't see you like a translator you know like you are like
Paulo: world-level athlete at the same time perfect translating as a friend and thank thank you very very much and hope to see you here again yeah absolutely anytime engine and
Engin Terzi: Thank you, guys. Thank you. Bye bye.
