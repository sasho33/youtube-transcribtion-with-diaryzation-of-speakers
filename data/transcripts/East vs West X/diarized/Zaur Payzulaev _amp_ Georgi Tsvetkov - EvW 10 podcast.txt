Engin Terzi: So, how are you, Zawar? Good? Alhamdulillah? Alhamdulillah, I'm good. Good. Good. Period. Sitkov? Sitkov will come in five minutes. Five minutes. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: um in the home go go somewhere there's good wi-fi good internet ah good good yeah good internet you need to find yeah um right now we are on youtube right now live
Engin Terzi: Hello, hello, hello, hello. Can you hear me okay? Yes, yes. Good. Pablo is the savior. Because I'm incredibly busy, I made a huge mistake and I didn't ask Pablo. I don't know how I forgot.
Engin Terzi: but I just called Paolo only 20 minutes before the live. And he said, Engind, I will help you. And then I was like, yeah, you're the man. Guys on the chat, Paolo is the man. So how is everything, Paolo? Everything is okay, busy at work. Start my preparation for a monster factory.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): in december everything is okay you know uh healing some injuries and uh training all good how are you hanging training i just trained two days ago with arif he was he was he was too strong but still you know um so
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Can you ask him, you know, how he has been doing? Yeah, absolutely. Zaur, hello. Can you hear me well? Yes, yes, good. Artem you on the road? Yes, I'm on the road. I have to get there in 10 minutes. It was a bit short. Engin called me 20 minutes ago, just asked if I could. He forgot to warn me. And that's it.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): And again, he's saying that everything is good, training, getting ready. Everything is planned already, tickets are purchased.
Engin Terzi: Yep, he's open. And what's his weight right now? He says, I dried out a little bit. So like 164, 165. Oh, so he dried, yeah. Poor, poor Zaur. He lost so much weight. Engin, do you hear me? Yes, I hear you. Okay, I hear you.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): He says, poor, poor, poor Zaur. He says, how sorry we are for you. Only 165 kilograms. You need to work a little harder, right? Yeah. Georgi. What? Georgi, did you eat? Well, yes. A little bit. A little bit. I'm asking him if he ate already.
Engin Terzi: not so much not so much okay yeah um uh jorge it is not so polite to put your legs on the table you know just can you bring them down okay oh are you intimidated by by this man
Engin Terzi: No, I'm not scared. No, I'm not scared. No, not intimidated. Not intimidated. Zaur, people are thinking that because you didn't pull so many super matches, people think that you will get out. They think that you don't have good endurance. Do you agree with that? Zaur, there is such an opinion.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): due to the fact that you don't fight often and don't have super matches, but you fight in competitions, that you may not have enough endurance for a super match. What do you think about this? I think it's time to check this point. For this, I myself am interested whether it is enough or not. It is clear that there are no people who are too endurance. But let's check.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Zaur is saying that he is interested himself and he's ready to check if it's going to be enough or not. Okay, but does he care about his endurance or he's still more focused on explosiveness that he wouldn't need endurance? Zaur, the question is this. When I was training, I was mostly on my...
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): yeah he's saying both uh endurance and uh you know and power and he was uh he was doing a lot of sparring so yeah he was working on both of them
Engin Terzi: Okay, before we go to Georgi, one more question. Does he think that what happened at the 2021 WAF wars was an accident? And like something that should never happen? Or it was something that he takes it very seriously and bases his training?
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): because of that negative experience.
Zaur Paizulaev: No, in the 21st. Oh, in the 21st. In the 21st, I had an old injury on my right, an epicendylitis. I finished it in two weeks. It was my first start. And I didn't do well. My left side was resting a lot, so my left side was fine. Although my left side is weaker. It's a half time weaker than the left side.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Okay. Enginzo saying that his right foot was injured and the actual form was not good on the right hand side. On the left hand side,
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): He was resting a lot, that's why I left for dominating the tournament. The ride was not really good, but he said I still was very much surprised that he opened up my wrist, that he cracked my wrist.
Engin Terzi: Yep. The question is, I said I'm going to go to the Georgi, but Georgi can wait a little bit because I think after this one he will automatically say his opinion. Zaur, you told me, you personally told me that Georgi, in your opinion, is stronger than both Hermes and Devon. Do you still think that way? Zaur, Hermes says that you personally told him
Zaur Paizulaev: Do you think that Georgi is stronger than Devon or than the gladiator Hermes? Well, let's say, for me, it's better to fight Devon or this guy. It will be more convenient, because they have smaller wrists.
Zaur Paizulaev: And he's saying that
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): uh yeah i still think that for me stylistically it's easier to pull with hermes or devon because of the wrist size and strength and uh his uh style is explosive style and because of uh georgie have very very strong and big wrist it's uh more dangerous for him uh
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): more dangerous for him so he said that this this actual super match is very well set up and this is uh you know i understand yeah i understand and and and uh jorge um are you gonna beat zaur yeah yeah i i'm pretty sure that i can i can beat him
Georgi Tsvetkov: not easy but i think that i would i will win this match and and if you win who would you want like next someone like devon maybe or after if i win now this super match against our the next opponent i want uh devon right hand right hand but uh do you think he will accept
Engin Terzi: Yes, I think that he will accept because he knows that I'm very strong on the right hand and you know. How does he know that? What? How does he know that your right arm is stronger? My... Does he know that your right arm is stronger than your left or he knows that your right arm is stronger than his right arm? He knows because after...
Georgi Tsvetkov: our super match in manchester we played with right hand and he knows that my right hand is much stronger than my left and and then in this case do you think he will accept or he will not accept i think that he wants to to fight me on the right hand and i i'm confident that you accept this match okay i'm not gonna ask i'm not gonna ask what happened you know but
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Did it look like your left arm supermatch or different? No, in a much different way. Different? Okay, that's all I wanted to ask you. Okay, I understand, yeah. Let me translate a couple of words for Russia. He asked him, how do you feel? Can you win this supermatch? He said, yes, I feel good. He said, it's not easy, but most likely I can win. He said, I'm ready.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Engin then asked him, who would you like next if you win? And Georgi answered very beautifully. He said, not after I win, but if I win, I would like to fight with Larratt on the right hand. We tried Manchester a little after our Supermatch on the left hand.
Engin Terzi: Zaur, this guy says that after he beats you, he wants to pull Devon. Do you think such thing will happen?
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Yes, he asks, yes, he says, well, he pours oil into the fire. He said something else, he says that Georgi said that after he defeats you, he wants to fight with Larratt. He says, how do you think this is possible, will it happen? Well, what to say, it depends on preparation. I think that I can also destroy the trainer, well,
Zaur Paizulaev: Okay, Engin, yes, I was saying that, listen, anything is possible.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): A lot of this depends on preparation, on our preparation. And he said, well, if Georgi will be able to stop the match, then Zaur believes that Georgi's endurance is better than his. But he said it's very, very questionable if he will be able to. So we'll see. Okay. I understand. Yeah. Yep. Yep. I understand. That is...
Engin Terzi: that is that is yeah a good one so basically georgie's goal is to stop zaor and zaor's goal is to flash georgie so we will see on november 11th wow wow um because of you guys i'm making um extra uh
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): floor you know on the stage so they wouldn't collapse you know so just please don't jump on the stage yeah
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Zaur, when I invite you guys to do dinner, when you guys come here, keep your plates away from Georgi, okay? He says, Zaur, I'll invite you to dinner here when you're in Istanbul. He says, keep your plate close to you and away from Georgi, because he'll eat everything.
Engin Terzi: He eats everything. He eats everything. He ate like five lemons. What? He eats a lot. Yeah, he eats a lot. Yeah. Okay, so let's go to... He said he is 164 kilos. What's your weight right now, Georgi? I'm right now 162 kilograms.
Engin Terzi: Wow. Georgi, have you reached the 200 kilo or 190 or something? I reached 200 kilograms in the beginning of 2021. I was 200 kilograms. Oh, during the COVID you even gained more weight at home, right? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah too much and i gained 200 kilograms and right now you are you lost 38 kilos yes yes yes and and do you feel even stronger huh because oh i feel much stronger much much better i i do everything better walking sleeping my body is feeling much better now
Georgi Tsvetkov: And right now you are at somewhere that you are training together with Krassim and Sasho? I'm now in the city of Sasho and Krassim and we are training together. Today at lunch time I trained with Krassim and now when we finish the podcast I'm going to train two hours with Sasho. Wow.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): These guys are crazy. Let me translate real fast. Yeah, okay, go ahead.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Then he asked about training. And yes, he is sparring with Krazy. Today they have already sparred with Krazy. And when the podcast ends, he will still have one sparring with Sasho. So we laughed a little bit that a lot of sparring is happening.
Engin Terzi: um there is a super chat jared williams zaul you cannot crack george's wrist impossible this is super chat and he also said georgie how much stronger was devon's right hand i don't understand this question how much stronger was devon's right arm does he mean compared to his left arm or do you mean
Engin Terzi: compared to Georgi. You don't need to do super shit. Can you write? Can you clarify? You know what we ask? So I can ask that way. Yeah. And Sasho is also getting ready for John and Artem Taino.
Georgi Tsvetkov: yes yes he's he's training yeah you you give him you give him left arm training you will give him uh yes yes yes yesterday and uh i trained only with grassy and today will be the first training because he had some work to do and but i will be all week in this city we will train a lot a lot of times
Engin Terzi: also left arm and right arm both arms yeah yeah yeah yeah but left arm you are only giving him training for his sign on match probably because you don't have a ball right now you don't have yes i want to i want to help him for his preparation against artem tynov i will i will help him
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Okay. The question he explained, he's saying how much difference between Devon's left and right arm. Can you say this? Because your right and left is also two different levels.
Georgi Tsvetkov: i think that uh devon right arm is stronger because uh i could how much stronger is him we know that he's stronger with writer compared to his left this is what he is asking much stronger much stronger because my right arm is also much stronger than my left and uh i think that his right is also much stronger than the left arm
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, they pulled the right arm training match as well. He already said this. And okay, so like, do you also chat with Sasho? How does he see his chances against John and Taino?
Georgi Tsvetkov: Does he talk about it? No, I haven't seen him yet, Engin. Oh, you haven't seen him yet. You didn't even see him. Oh, okay, okay, okay. No, we trained only with Krasi. Today, after the podcast, will be our first training with Sasho. Oh, with Sasho. Okay, I thought at least you sit down and say hello or something, but you didn't train. No, no, he had some work. He was not in the city and today... Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. I missed that part, yeah. Okay. Anyway, so, Zaur.
Engin Terzi: My friend, you injured your bicep, and I think you had surgery. And then only like three, four months later, you competed the AMC event. I will ask a few questions, but I will go one by one. First of all, wasn't it too early to compete AMC event when there are like Slav and Laletin, the high-level pullers? Wasn't it too early?
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Can you ask him this question? Zaur, he says, well, you had a bicep injury. And as far as I understand, you had an operation. And he says, literally in three months, we already saw you competing at AMC. And he says, there were very good athletes like Laletin and Silaev. And he says, you didn't start too early. Is everything okay?
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Before he answers, Zaur, can you turn your phone sideways also, Georgi, if possible? And you did, Georgi, as well? Thank you. Okay, Zaur.
Zaur Paizulaev: You have to answer. Of course, I tried. I thought I would take at least the second place. I thought I would win anyway. In fact, I went after the money. I decided not to lose money anyway. I had only one and a half months of preparation. I rested for half a month from them. A month of hard training. For that tournament.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Yeah, and he's saying that, yeah, it was a little bit too early and I knew that it's a little bit risky, but there was a very good money and he knew that he probably going to take like second place there and steal a good money. And he said, yeah, it was a little bit too early because I only had like a month of preparation with the training. And you know, that's what it is, but need to make a living. And another question.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): How much was in percentage in that event compared to his best?
Zaur Paizulaev: Okay, yeah. And he's saying that the actual angle was a Brachialis.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): he got pretty good to approximately 90%, but everything else like a wrist and a side was maybe at 65 to 70%, maximum at 80, but no more than that. Yeah, but that's interesting because he injured bicep and this was 90%.
Engin Terzi: While he didn't injure his wrist, he's talking about 65 or something. He's not actually talking about the actual bicep, but he's talking about the brachioradialis. Listen, even when you do brachioradialis, your bicep just falls on you. I'm just saying that why would his wrist power go down that much since the injury is not there? That's interesting. You want me to ask him?
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Yeah, I mean, yeah. I was curious. It's interesting, he says, your biceps were injured, and still, when you train your arch, your biceps work a lot too. He says, and the wrist and the back are so far behind. Did you just lose more in them, or why did it happen? Because I just forgot to train them especially, I mean, I can't remember the time.
Zaur Paizulaev: uh that was kind of a lack of time basically because uh for the bracho radialis he was doing a lot of
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): small settings and everything else because he was trying to keep the blood circulating there and about wrist and everything else he kind of forgot because he was concentrated on repair of that you know the injury and then the the other question from july to november we have like another four months where will he be or where is he now where is he at now and where will he be
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): planning, you know, till the event, will he be 100%? Okay, Engin asks, look, between July and November, about 4 months, he asks, what do you think, where are you now, at this moment, approximately in percentage, and what do you expect when you will be in November approximately in percentage?
Zaur Paizulaev: I'm afraid to work with big weights now. I used to lift big weights, I knew the example on blocks, big weights there, big weights here. And now I don't even know what to say, maybe 90 percent, but now I'm 100 percent, I still can't gain weight, because I have
Zaur Paizulaev: There were some difficulties, I had to brush my teeth, then I got poisoned a month ago. There were some unpleasant moments, but now everything is fine. Do you think you'll get to November 100%? Unfortunately, I can't wait, I can't. Okay. But do you think that if you say 90 now, you'll be 90-something?
Zaur Paizulaev: uh engine okay so basically the answer is like this uh he cannot answer uh for sure because he is not working with uh
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): huge weights right now. He's still at the mediocre weights because he's a little bit afraid of the injury to be re-injured again. So he cannot answer that question for sure. He thinks that he's right now at about 85% overall, 85 to 90. And he said, maybe I will be a little bit more to the November, maybe 90 plus 92 or something like that.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): uh it was a little bit of issues with his stomach he got some poisoning about months ago but right now everything fine he's training but he's not lifting huge weights and he doesn't want to check that because he he used to check the form by lifting your weight and he said if i can lift like 100 kg on my angle i know i'm at 100 if i cannot that i i know where i'm at but right now
Engin Terzi: he cannot check that as he used to check that because he doesn't want to injure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But sometimes, you know, just because we are lifting a little bit below what we lift, it doesn't mean that we cannot lift, you know, the best. But we just try not to do that. We say that for the competition, we took the risk for the competition. No need to risk here. It's even better for him, in my opinion. For sure. And Georgi,
Georgi Tsvetkov: what is your shape right now with dry time and do you think that like next month november 11th you will be at your best shape ever is it possible oh i think that now i'm in pretty good shape because uh we used to train together with uh krasimir during the summer and yesterday he told me that i'm much much stronger than the summer
Georgi Tsvetkov: and uh also right now right now your shape is already better than when you pull against morozov yes much better maybe five six seven percent better and also i tried after the match with devon to do some gym workout you know heavy weights and uh i did maybe 20 more than uh before during the summer so so i think that in one month i will be
Georgi Tsvetkov: maybe in even better shape i will be in very good shape and they will be probably your best shape ever compared to your past maybe yes i don't want to say that but yeah i'm pretty sure that i will be in much much better shape than in the match with morozov and also i try to in clean to be lean you know i am i have not eat sugar for already four months
Engin Terzi: can i ask you something when you don't eat any sugar except like losing weight or something do you feel any difference like with your body anything different like and if it is then what is that i i was weight much easier i don't have inflammation in my body yes and i and also i i think
Georgi Tsvetkov: that i sleep better because in the past you sleep better yes because in the past i tried to eat a lot of sweets before bedtime and now when i don't eat them i feel that i i sleep better i think the sugar is number one name to the people and i don't i quit it i don't like yeah let me translate a little bit
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): I asked him what state he was in. He said he was in a very good state. He said he was in better shape than when he fought with Morozov. He said he was gaining weight. He said he was 5-6% better than he was then. He said he tried to work with weights in the gym. He said the weights were going very well. He said he gained up to 20% in some movements.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): If there are some questions that you're asking and I'm not asking here,
Engin Terzi: I have some reasons, you understand, but I don't have to say the reasons because some things cannot be said. So just please, no need to push it, you know. And there is a super shit. Thank you, my friend. And what does Georgi think about a match against Hermes? How do you see your chance if such match happens? Super shit. Me against Hermes? Yeah.
Georgi Tsvetkov: i think that i will talk about ms because when we played with devon in england he told me that i'm much stronger than ms and my hand control is amazing you don't need to say everything he tells you you put in devil in a hard time no i want to tell you that he he pulled hermes uh five days before me and so he told me that
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Right now, Hermes is watching the podcast. I think that I will top him. Not easy win, but I will beat him. I asked him about Hermes. If you had a match with Hermes, what do you think? I think after he fought with Larratt,
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Yep. Okay, ready. Okay, anyway, so Zaur.
Engin Terzi: Zaur, you said that this match is important for you.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): You both have the same style. It's good that it's going to be hard for both of you. And the question is, what are your short-term and long-term plans for the future at IS vs. FES? Well, yes, this match is my first one. It's going to be an armfight, right?
Zaur Paizulaev: And Engin picked up a good pair of players, the ones I needed to test myself. He's a good opponent for me in terms of inconvenience. But if I win, I'll be able to get to the final, to the winner. As long as Milan isn't there, I don't know who will be there, behind the train.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Zawar said that short term is to win this first supermatch. This is our first supermatch format. Huge credit to you. You set up this supermatch perfectly.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): to test him, to test Zaur, because this is probably one of the most dangerous opponents stylistically for him. And then he said, if I will win this match, then the long-term plans are as fast as possible to get to the top guys for the belt. And while Levan is off of the chart because of the injury, he wants to work out all the way to the top.
Engin Terzi: uh of the you know food chain for the belt and then uh the the last stop is lebanon when he comes back okay so the eye is to the title as soon as possible okay you want you want go ahead what's that
Engin Terzi: He cannot wait. Let's go. Let's go. Yeah, Ivan Kozlich, best regards to you and your guest. And a special thank you to Sikita Terzi and all hard-working people behind the scenes that are making the magic East-West-West happen. Thank you very much, my friend. Okay. And you. Your eye. Where is your eye?
Georgi Tsvetkov: short term to beat Zaur and then do you also have that target? Artem you going to have that belt on you, Georgi? I think that all of us who are heavyweights want to pull Levan and to beat him. And that is my dream one day. But for now, because he's still injured after Zaur, I want to be deviant to take your belt.
Engin Terzi: And this is my main goal for now. Rick Harrow, I think Bobby Ray was talking about when he trained with Georgi, maybe he was not recovered because he had a supermatch with Hermes four days ago. That's what he meant, probably. He's not talking about the next Denis match.
Engin Terzi: good good good i liked it i liked it that everyone has that that eye on the belt and then he wants to be number one i i love it you know yeah and i think about this build every day i do good yeah yeah i live for this yes i mean come on to be number one in the world you know that that that should be the goal you know that i respect you know
Engin Terzi: I don't like even like your chance is not so high. I'm not talking about you generally. You should just dream or to become the best, you know? Yep. Anyway, so and Zaur, do you do any kind of table training or you just do the lifting? Zaur, do you spar with the guys or do you just lift now?
Engin Terzi: No, I started sparring. I had about three sparrings already. I started sparring, yes. Okay, okay. Yeah, he started to do table time. He already done like three sessions on a table already, but yeah, yeah, he started. He started, okay. Okay, I understand. So, and then if he told you about, he asked Zaur, what does he think about the full event, the matches?
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Sorry, guys, I'm moving my neck because I have some neck issues. All good. Zaur, what do you think about the whole event that was organized by Engin? In general, there are so many famous athletes on the map. What do you think about it? I think it's one of the coolest events.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): He said that, in his opinion, it's one of the best events he ever saw. And it's a very, very powerful event. And the players are set very, very closely.
Georgi Tsvetkov: And he said each event is getting better and better. Thank you. Thank you. Spasibo. Spasibo. And Georgi, do you think that this is the best card yet? This versus West End? In my opinion, this is the best competition on this stage ever. The best card. You know, all the matches are amazing.
Engin Terzi: very interesting to watch and they are unpredictable it's very difficult to tell who will win the match who will be the the winner it's very difficult yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah some some some matches some people think that it will be uh not so hard but just it sometimes depends like like interesting thing is that when devon was pulling against hermes
Engin Terzi: Devon was underdog. And then now Devon is pulling Denis. Denis is underdog. When Gennady pulled Dave Sheffy, Gennady was underdog. I can't show you. When Jerry was pulling Gennady, Jerry was underdog on the polls. You never know what's going to happen. People say this, and then some other thing happens.
Engin Terzi: Let's start about the predictions and start with Zaur. Zaur, do you know who Kamil Jablonski is? Or Jablonski, I don't know how to pronounce. Zaur, do you know Kamil Jablonski? Yes, I know. He's going to pull right arm against Ivan Ivan Matyushenko. Who is winning, Zaur?
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Yeah, he thinks that Ivan Matyushenko gonna win because stylistically Ivan Matyushenko pulling in the hook and Kamil pulling in triceps.
Georgi Tsvetkov: he will the matushenko will not let camille go into the triceps and he will you know pull him into the inside deep inside hook and he will win and then you georgie i think that if value win very easy this match because he's very fast very explosive and in hook he's very difficult to defeat to be beaten and i think that and then three minutes ago you said all the matches are unpredictable
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but this is my opinion about this match. Also, I like Ivan Ivan Matyushenko very much. He's one of my favorite armwrestlers. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just teasing. I'm just teasing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. We will see. We will see how it will be. Kamil is also seeing this as his, like, how to say, his chance of proving himself, opportunity, you know? And then...
Engin Terzi: And then we will see. Ivan is incredibly fast, using his wrist very fast. And he's like highest level experience. Almost 20 years he has been pulling. And then let's go to another match. Sarah Backman and Egle White Kudze. Zaur, are you familiar with the ladies? Zaur, do you know these girls? Sarah Backman and Egle. Yes.
Zaur Paizulaev: He knows the ladies and he said that Sarah is very, very strong, but he thinks because of the leverage, the egg will pull the wind through the top row. Oh, okay. I understand.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, people doesn't know much about Egle, but Egle is very strong. Egle is for sure one of the strongest female pullers in the history. But Sarah is also not the same Sarah of 10 years ago when they met.
Engin Terzi: i organized that match at that time egle won but sarah is different now egle lost against gabriella now it was i think like before she was beating gabriella and now i think she's gonna come even more serious and i think we will see a incredible battle and what do you think about this match georgie um i think that
Georgi Tsvetkov: Yvonne Sarri is different now than the past, but I think that Aguilera will be very uncomfortable for her. She is bigger, with bigger hands, and I think that Aguilera will win. Who is going to win? Aguilera. Aguilera is going to win, you think? Yes, yes. This is my opinion. Oh, okay. It will be not easy match, but she will win this match. I understand. Yeah, we will see. And then let's go to
Zaur Paizulaev: Another one. Frank Lamparelli . I think Frank Lamparelli .
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): during the translation he said that uh yeah it's a 50 50 match very close uh he thinks maybe frank is very very slight uh favorite but very slight and how do you see that georgie i think that both of them are amazing top powers but frank is more more dangerous and he has bigger experience and this will help him to win this match
Georgi Tsvetkov: He is very, very good. Matt is different, a little bit different. Did you see his match with Ron Betts? Yeah, but I think that also Frank will prepare himself very good for this event also. Yeah, for sure.
Engin Terzi: We will see. There is Andreev. Did Egle dominate 10 years ago? It was close. No, my friend. It was domination. I think she won 5-0. Dragos Boerenko. Thank you for your super chat. Georgi versus Beijing. Moldova, left hand. He says he never lost his Beijing flash pin in three times. Didn't he not lose it even then?
Engin Terzi: I will tell you before, I don't know if it is not the right answer, Gyorgy can inform me. Gyorgy's left arm was injured. He didn't even compete in the World Championships with left arm at that time. Three years he didn't compete and then the match was set for right arm. Travis versus Gyorgy match was set for right arm and then Travis not long before the event injured his
Engin Terzi: right pack chest and then they said let's pull left arm so he pulled with his injured left arm that he didn't pull for three years with Travis's bedroom which is left arm and a lot of people are talking about this but this is the story behind him so the match actually was set to be right arm you know
Engin Terzi: Am I correct everything I said or not? Yes, yes. I had three surgeries on my left arm and I didn't train this arm for two and a half years, nearly two years. Yeah, yeah. I understand. Yeah. I understand. Anyways, I think when you say that you didn't lose your wrist ever or something, mostly are you talking about your right? Yes, for my right arm. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so then let's go to another match. Zaur, Rustam Babaya versus Irakli Zirakashvili, 95 kilo. Rustam Babaya favorite. Rustam Babaya favorite. Rustam Babaya favorite.
Engin Terzi: And how do you see Georgi? We saw Zal, we saw Iraq losing against Dadikian, Ongarbaev. He also lost his wrist against John, but against the pullers who are going inside like Laughlin and Krasimir, Iraq comfortably won.
Engin Terzi: So Rustam is mainly going inside, but Rustam also can topple as well. I don't know how he would do against Irakli, but I don't remember. I think he lost against Sasho last time to inside Polish, as far as I remember. How do you see this match, Gerd?
Georgi Tsvetkov: I think that Irakli will win because the style of Rustam will be very good for his style. And also Rustam is a little bit short, right? Yes, Irakli is taller with longer hands and I think that he will top roll him and he will beat him. Not an easy match, but I think that Irakli will win. Let me translate this for Zaur.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Georgi thinks that Irakli will win because Rustam will be a very comfortable opponent for him due to the difference in height and style. And he thinks that he will be able to beat him.
Zaur Paizulaev: Well, I don't think so. Rustam Baer is more experienced, and he always found the keys to any hands. His hands are small, but he always knew how to go deep or found methods to win. I think... Yes, the other thing that Rustam still favours... I translated to him what Georgi said.
Engin Terzi: But he said, you know what, Rustam always been finding keys to any arms. So he believes that he'll find it this time too. And his endurance is better, he believes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dragos, I understand my friend, but just I told you the situation, you know. The guy is not pulling for three years. And then right before the event, his opponent's right arm is injured. The match is set with right arm. He doesn't even train his left arm.
Engin Terzi: agree you know um okay so let's go another one um now do i have you don't know much about me but do i have any chance against samusha but don't be nice because like maybe you know you wouldn't want to hurt my feelings and i know we are all brothers you guys see me as brother in our messing and
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): and how do you see i'm not going to ask paulo paulo is just too positive i'm always too positive okay just one second one second iraqi lost against hutching last time inside pullers
Zaur Paizulaev: My friend, do you believe that, you know, like, you had Hutchings did an inside move against Irakli? Okay, whatever, you know, just... Okay, sorry, Zaur, sorry. Go ahead. I think Engin, I saw how he fights, he fights high. I think Samushia... And I think the first one or two rounds will be won by Engin.
Engin Terzi: Engin will win the early round, and then Somoshe will come with Endurus and beat me. Engin, why do you need me here? Come on. No, I was just guessing. I don't even understand anything in Russian. That's what he said, basically, that the first or first two rounds you're going to win.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): because of your explosiveness and that top role. But he said that Samushia is very, very, has very, very good endurance. And he believes that he will be able to drag you inside and then start winning. So basically, he thinks he's going to beat me either 3-1 or 3-2. Yes.
Engin Terzi: yeah thank you paulo thank you i was just like you know uh acting quick like did i understand or not you know but just thank you yes you did you did yeah give me give me a trophy give me old medal or something and and how do you see georgie um i think that you will be very bad opponent for samusha but because you are very fast and uh with your top row
Georgi Tsvetkov: this will be a very big problem for him. But if he stops you, he will take the win. But in my opinion, you have the bigger chance. Does it matter where he stops me, in what position? Like him stopping me like this or stopping me like this? Does it make a difference? Yes, because if you top roll him, I don't see how he can beat you. But if he stops you inside,
Georgi Tsvetkov: I know, I know, I know. I think that you have the better chance because Samushia doesn't like fast pours like you. You are very fast and very dangerous. Yeah, but being fast and you need to be strong as well. You know, you can be fast. Like, do you know what? Like during my career, many times,
Engin Terzi: I flashed the guys and people whenever I watch it from outside and whenever people watch from outside with a video or whatever they say that like I was so fast in fact the guy I felt it he hit me before I hit him but I didn't it didn't move my hand so that speed didn't really
Engin Terzi: matter you understand that that like there needs to be a force behind you know so speed is important but you are not gonna bring that arm down without actually applying the necessary pressure you know yeah i just wanted to tell that samusha is good against slow powers like or you are different type of poor for him the style is different totally different
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah that's for sure that's for sure but just we will see because he is young he is healthy and now yeah yeah very prime you know like right now i'm probably pulling the best samush ever you know while while i'm just coming back for i will be 49 years old
Engin Terzi: and and i'm not i didn't have stem cell like devon yet but again you know that in arm wrestling not always the stronger one wins you know you have to be also smart with better techniques yep muhammad says no way that samusha can be angry without his wrist it depends on the position if you are like this and if he is behind like this hard to lift but if you are here
Engin Terzi: And if he is like this, then it's hard for him. So we will see that. We will see. But I'm just focusing on taking his wrist. Sometimes I'm thinking that I need to do both, you know, control his pronator, just hanging his pronator hand not to take his wrist and then moving that way. But once he has a little bit wrist, he will be trouble. So I better take his wrist, you know. This is my opinion here.
Engin Terzi: anyway so let's go to another one let's go to another one this one i just want at percentage percentage that's all i don't want any detail zaul paisley versus george swedco 50 50
Engin Terzi: 50-50. And you, Georgi? 55-45 for me. Ah, okay. Translated. Yeah, okay. Okay, then let's continue. Some more matches. How do you see Artem, Taino, Zaur?
Zaur Paizulaev: left against Sasho Andriy. Artyom Tainok, Sasho Andriy, right? Yes, left. Oh, this is a difficult moment. I think Artyom will definitely take the first two rounds. But if Sasho catches him somewhere in the second round, Sasho, it seems to me, is more resilient than Artyom Tainok.
Zaur Paizulaev: But in general, Artyom is more of a 30-rounder. I think he has three rounds to win. Do you think Artyom is a little bit of a favorite? A little bit of a favorite, yes. Because he's explosive, he can be a 30-rounder, a hooker, I don't know. And he just carries it.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): uh zaur thinks that uh probably artyom is a little favorite but not too much it's close match and he thinks that if sasho will catch him in uh inside position then it's maybe over for artyom because he believes that sasho's endurance is better but overall he thinks that
Georgi Tsvetkov: and he can pull anywhere, tap, three triceps, and hook, he believes that Artyom is slight favorite. And you, Georgi? I know what you are going to say, but... I think this is a very close match, and I think that the chances are 50-50. Wow. Yeah, because Artyom is very fast, and
Georgi Tsvetkov: very dangerous but if sasha stop him i think that sasha has better endurance and he can he he will win it's very important how the match will go it's this is the situation and i think it's 50 50 match i understand and okay do you remember the last time
Engin Terzi: 2021 WAF when Taino won. But do you remember that right before that, I think only one round before, Plemen and Sasho killed each other. Plemen was this position, Sasho was like this. Very long match, very long. I think more than 30 seconds. And then one round or two rounds after that,
Engin Terzi: Taino did the same thing, Sasho was like this, the same exact position, and then he got tired and he did something very unexpected, and then he just went deep inside and pressed him, you know. And so this time they both will be fresh, but lately
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Taino looks even better than before. Sasho also looks incredible. So we will see a very close match. And this is a very deserving match for the world title. Devon't you agree? Yeah, yeah.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Okay, what do you guys think about Hutchings vs. Ongarwevzor?
Zaur Paizulaev: I think that Ongarbaev will win, because that Hutchings, he doesn't know how to fight the uppercut. He doesn't know how, he just doesn't have time for them, that is, he's already at the end of the lead, and then it's too late, they're already bringing him to the pillow. Although he has a very strong hook.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): But if he catches the hook once, he can beat Kedrgaly. But I think Kedrgaly will win. Kedrgaly is a favorite. He thinks that Kedrgaly is a favorite. He said that, yeah, Tad Hutchings can catch him, but the endurance of Kedrgaly is great, too. And he believes that Tad Hutchings doesn't know how to pull against good tap rollers.
Engin Terzi: and he have a problem with that so he said kidder gali is his favorite i mean he's he said that hutchins is good too and he may catch him but he said most likely yeah but um not i don't uh disagree about his prediction i don't get along i respect uh um i don't get involved i meant uh but pulling against the good top rollers he beat john
Engin Terzi: He beat Chen Shou. He beat Irakli Zirakashvili lately. And he has wins against also Stoyan Golemonov some years ago, but right? Yeah. In the past, he was trying to hook guys, but whenever now Topolur goes, he also pronates and then he also applies pronated side pressure. I don't know. I am expecting an incredible match. I am expecting...
Engin Terzi: how to start aggressive, and Kongar will have to stop him somewhere here. To recover from there, or not being able to recover, we will see. And I see 50-50. Just my opinion. I only give prediction when it is 50-50, so other than that, I don't see anything. Let me translate this. Engin says, I will not argue with you, I respect your opinion, but I have a slightly different opinion.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): About the top-rollers, he says, look, Djana, Brzenk, Djanko, he won. Zirakashvili, he won, yes. And he says he knows how to fight. He says, as I see this match, he says most likely that Irakli will stop him. Irakli won. He stops here.
Zaur Paizulaev: And whether Ongarbaev will be able to get out of here is another question. He says, I think it's a very close match, and he says, I think it's 50-50. He says, it's going to be a great match. It's going to be a good match, yes. You've already seen, when Khadymurov fought at the top, he won at the top. If he had gone, he would have lost. Well, Khadymurov. Yes, yes.
Zaur Paizulaev: Okay, okay. Yep. Got it. Ready, Engin. Oh, he didn't say anything? Okay.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): No, he said that, yeah, he said, I agree, it's very, very good match, but he still thinks that he may have problems against top roller, bigger problems than against hoop. Okay. Yeah. No, that's for sure. That's for sure. You know, it's just very, very hard to be. And Georgi?
Georgi Tsvetkov: I think that Todd Hutchings is in very good shape right now and I think that he improved his technique against top rowers and I think that he has the he has more horse power and he will win this fight not easy but I think that Todd will win this fight okay so Zaur is saying that
Engin Terzi: is going to win and you are saying that Todd is going to win. And how about Zaur, John Brzenk versus Sasho? John Brzenk is my favorite Sasho. And you?
Georgi Tsvetkov: right now maybe john is in very good shape and maybe 60 40 for john wow don't you think this will be upset with you and he will he will beat the out of you no no i i don't want to accept him but i just say my opinion and yeah i think that john is in very good shape now and he has one more month to prepare and you know
Georgi Tsvetkov: i don't think that sasha will be not in good form but you know john is usually bigger man than sasha with bigger hands longer hands and he's the the favorite for me because because johnny is not super explosive at the moment so i think sasho will have time to engage but we will see yeah yeah also very interesting match i believe so yeah i believe so
Engin Terzi: especially if it is in sep and if john tries to take everything the hand and everything then his pronator maybe counts you know
Engin Terzi: But if he goes halfway and then go over his pronator, like if you remember Spartak Zolaev did the 2019 Europeans. And that time, yeah, he didn't really try to take his hand. He didn't go deep in, but he was like more like pronator, like half hook or something, you know, that way. We will see. We will see how it will be, but incredible. Okay, let's come to the main event. Zaur, Denis Siplenko versus Devon Aras.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Denis Tsiplenkov will win, you see. I think he even has more endurance now than Loret. Wow, that's interesting, that's interesting that
Engin Terzi: Like who was those two, Arsene Liliev and who was the other one? Yeah, yeah. They also, they both also said that, you know, Denis is going to win. Yeah. Because right now community is heavily, I can say around 60%, 55, 60%. I shouldn't say heavily, but thinks that Devon is going to win. And many of them are saying that he's going to,
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): destroy him while the people who has experience with dennis um are thinking that dennis is gonna win
Zaur Paizulaev: Okay.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): yeah zaur thinks that danny is gonna win and he said that uh in a position of basically a king's move uh dennis can stay almost forever and he he can overstay anybody in this world he said i understand and and it will be very close match very difficult match for both of them and uh i think that
Georgi Tsvetkov: dennis is getting in very good shape you see how he progress and i really believe that he will win this fight because he has very big endurance and maybe in one fight he will take the win it's my opinion that's this devon is smarter but
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Denis is stronger, I think, physically stronger, and he is very uncomfortable, very difficult to grip. Let me translate this to the press. Yes, Georgi also thinks that Denis will win. He says, yes, Larratt is kind of smarter and wiser at the table, but Denis is definitely stronger, and Denis is very uncomfortable in order to take his grip, he says, and I think that Denis will win.
Engin Terzi: Yep. Okay. Okay, so Zaur, you at the beginning of the program, you said first you wanted to take the title from Devon and then you wanted to go to Levan. In that case, your prediction, you wanted to take the title from Denis.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): You said that you want to win this supermatch and then go to the top, to Lebanon. If Denis, according to your prediction, wins against Larratt, you will have to go through Denis. We will go to the top.
Zaur Paizulaev: There are no options. If I develop my strength, then I can win three rounds with a quick start. If there are three rounds, I can't make it in time.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): If I'm in Dubai, I might not be able to win. But if I'm here, I might be able to win. Okay, I'll translate. Zaur says that there is no other option for me. He says we have to go up all the time. And he said, you know, if I will be 100% ready, then for three times,
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): so best of five three times he said i can sneak the win because of my explosiveness and flashpin him he said if it's gonna happen let's say in dubai then probably not it's not gonna be enough endurance to do that talking about dennis yes but here he have i may have a good chance to flash him three times okay okay let's see let's see how it will be an incredible event is waiting and
Engin Terzi: till the event evening, we all will be very, very friendly brotherhood. We will laugh, we will eat, we will enjoy. And then when it hits to 8 p.m. Saturday, local time, November 11th, and then, bah, the monster will come out from all of us. And then we will see.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Anyways, guys, I think there is one more super chat came. Oh, sorry. Yeah, go ahead.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): Yeah, sport is sport. Okay, Engen, ready? Zaur, Zaur, are you excited to be on this stage?
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): he's saying that yeah it's very exciting uh he was only watching this on tv and now he's gonna be part of it and he said maybe in the after pool you know i will pull with somebody uh yeah since it's gonna be three flash pins right right so he will need to spend his energy somewhere right
Engin Terzi: He said, my left is going to be fresh. Ah, okay, okay, okay. So he disagreed with what I said. So, Zaur, you think you're not going to have three flash pins? So your right arm is not going to be so fresh? Who, who?
Zaur Paizulaev: The other thing is that it's 100%.
Translator (possibly Engin Terzi): he would win confidently. But he said that he doesn't think that it's going to be 100% by November. And he said it's very possible that he's going to catch me somewhere. So we'll see. So what should I understand is, so he's not winning this time, but maybe next time? I don't know. He's winning. He's still going to win. But he said Georgi has better chances now compared to his 100%.
Engin Terzi: okay okay see georgie how lucky you are we will see and again i'm very sorry but i gotta go yeah okay i'm finishing adonis king can you ask zaur if he will spar with dennis thank you um i asked him this before and most likely no
Engin Terzi: But you can ask him because he can be happy. The guy will ask because I don't want to get involved so much, but I think I know the answer. Can you ask him? Engin, one more time, I'm sorry. Can you ask him if he's going to do any sparring with Denis before his match with Georgi? Zaur, is there any sparring planned with Denis before your match with Georgi or not?
Zaur Paizulaev: No, no, I decided. I sparring here. My elbow sprained a little. Well, I'm trying now to deal with it in such an easy time. Georgi Zaur said, no, that there is nothing scheduled. He said that because of my sparring.
Engin Terzi: here i have a little slight inflammation in my elbow so he said i'm gonna go light on my sparring so i'm not gonna go sparring with this okay anyways guys thank you very very much my friend um and see you very soon and keep in touch keep in touch and sour thank you my friends yeah and and uh my friends thank you very much paulo no problem
Engin Terzi: Thank you everyone and thanks to everyone who watched us. I think I will be with you guys maybe a few more minutes and then I go also. I'm tired.
Engin Terzi: it is kind of hard to focus on myself as a competitor and at the same time organize especially this this level of the event together is very very hard it's kind of exhausting but no excuse so i'm i said i'm gonna pull i'm gonna pull if he wins he's the better one so so guys i
Engin Terzi: If there is anything you would like to ask interesting, you can ask and then maybe I answer and then I go away. Hmm.
Engin Terzi: I will do my best, Mohamed. I will do my best. I'm not in bad shape. I train. I did two table times with Arif and I plan to do two more before the events. So I'm not in bad shape. I'm in good shape, but we will see if it will be enough for Davit and
Engin Terzi: Yep, but sometimes even the professionals may be wrong, my friends. I think Devon versus Denis match, Denis better bring much better shape than what he showed us still.
Engin Terzi: Yes, Bobby, I tried to do all the preparation in advance so that last one week I wouldn't be so exhausted. Thank you very much, Ivan. Thank you. Thank you.
Engin Terzi: Devon, I don't do the prediction, Rick. But as I said, you know, Denis better bring a better shape than what he showed us until now because we know where Devon is at. But Denis, we don't know yet. But, like, he doesn't look as good as his prime. And I'm not sure if he can be that good. But...
Engin Terzi: But he may be closer to that shape. And if it is close, then great match is waiting for us. I'm going 85 kilo, Bobby. If Devon would go down, I don't know what weight. I need to be at least 220 or something, but...
Engin Terzi: um i just did a little bit i hold dennis's hand people like two times or something not really he kind of just waited for me um yeah yes that was a high level guys you know all these guys are elite pullers and they cannot win there is one match two pullers one will win one will lose so of course i was gonna get more matches you know
Engin Terzi: I mean, but all these guys are elite, elite, elite, elite, you know, one will win, one will lose. If I only invite the winners, then after three events, there will be only one guy left, you know? I don't know, Alex. I don't think that Devon is getting lighter for Denis match. I think Devon is just like losing his like unnecessary weight. I think Devon is becoming
Engin Terzi: 30 years old Devon. And I think, I don't think that he is losing even like one gram of muscle. I don't think he is losing anything from the muscle. Like, like whenever he came here, like many people predicted, like, you know, oh, your arms are bigger than Devon's arms and he is weak. And then like, but come on, he was not, you know, you saw that, you saw him with,
Engin Terzi: by the waist that they are lifting, by the bicep size or something. Come on, man. It's much more than that, you know. We should have learned this already, you know. Did you do pull-ups recently? I think I did pull-ups. When did I do it? When did I do? I think last Thursday I did pull-ups, yeah. Bachelor injured? I didn't hear the bachelor injured. I didn't know anything about that.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah just just like you can be sure you can be sure Denis siplenko match is probably the most important match of Devon Aras I mean this this is like I don't have no doubt like they talked about this much more than 10 years you know right arm and there was a lot of talk
Engin Terzi: Like, you didn't want to put me right arm. No, I wanted to put right arm. It was only my left arm and this and that, you know. And now it's just like, I know you can feel the tense, you know. Even they try not to show, and there is tense, you know, between them. And this is very important. If you are thinking that devil is gonna go there in any weaker form,
Engin Terzi: then what we recently saw then you are mistaken you know devon knows about our message devon knows himself better than any other human know knows about him so you need to trust devon that he's gonna bring their best ever shape you know when he was here he went down to hundred nineteen hundred twenty people were saying that you know he's gonna so big and this
Engin Terzi: He was weak. No, my friend, Irakli is... I would go down 85, Irakli would go down 95, but if I was as ripped as Irakli, I would be 75 kilo. So... We will see, Bartosz, yeah. Anything is possible, yeah.
Engin Terzi: and um lastly uh it's not my event i don't know the rules anything about i don't know about the armors um i don't know how it works and didn't even really check his his numerous was declined in the winning position or losing position i didn't closely check that one in my event at the
Engin Terzi: natural and losing position or like natural to the pin pad anywhere here if you're who matters is down angle like this it's a foul but anything that you come this much over here to win in position it's not a foul you know no no no i think there are six title matches i will tell you devon versus uh devon versus dennis's title match on garvey is a title match
Engin Terzi: uh sarah beckman match is a title match my match is a title match and sasho artentino title match i think five matches here no no no i i'm not at 100 i will not be i i may not ever be at 100 uh but it is probably i will be like maybe between 90 95 90 for sure 95 probably not but somewhere 90 to
Engin Terzi: like 90, 92, 90, this is just my opinion, you know, just sometimes we are even just bullshitting about these exact numbers, you know, we are just, um, yes, Derrick Simo, yeah, I think it's going to be the best event, yeah, ever, yeah. Stem cells after this event, Brian, you know, I plan to apply for the U.S. visa, and then I want to, yeah,
Engin Terzi: um dennis says he's ready yeah we all are always like ready otherwise we wouldn't pull but will it be enough we would not be enough we will see you know uh arsene lilliev and levan saginashvili will be here my friend as guests yeah
Engin Terzi: yes hello sorry for my pronunciation i am i'm happy that east versus west is going to make your uh november better i'm very happy you know thank you rick harrow thank you thank you my friend again i will repeat because you've always
Engin Terzi: to your real armwrestling, true armwrestling fans for your support and for your trust. I make mistakes but I never do intentionally wrong. I see armwrestling bigger than me and I love armwrestling and I feel responsible and so
Engin Terzi: It is for me more like a mission. Mission and responsibility that fate put on my shoulders after the pandemic. So North American event next year, my friend. 2024, as we said. It's not this year. And hopefully everything will be good and we are going to do it. Yeah, it is already planned, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Engin will be staying in your place in the Pesos because you will... I want to put a big cartoon Engin, you know, and then he will be as organizer and I will be standing in front of Davit probably. Maybe Neil Pickup should do that, everything, you know. Neil Pickup should do it and then I should be there, you know.
Engin Terzi: would like to pull i mean if leonidas is interesting isaac uh i can i can set him yeah lone ranger and you really go to canada and train with devon's but he would be great it would be great um then a few times he said like i'm more than welcome and and to train it would be nice it would be nice to go train with him we spent some time here but it was right before the east russians west nine
Engin Terzi: phone was in my hand all the time devil knows you know I was always just you know it's not that easy trust me it will be very exhausting but I want to pull I want to compete I don't I cannot wait anymore just because I am organizing but I want to pull um yeah I want to pull this event so what so
Engin Terzi: own experiences knowledge with them they would like to hear so yeah that's all okay guys thank you very very much it's always fun to be with you guys and hopefully we will do another podcast after this one so let me just go and
Engin Terzi: I mean, do you think anything will happen when Denis and Devon meet in Istanbul? I hope not. I hope not. I saw that, I think it was a joke that Babken said, like, do you want this, like arm wrestling or something, or this? And then Devon said, are you going to hit me, or Denis is going to hit me, or you both want to hit me? And then things like that, you know, I don't understand. And then Denis said that, like, you know, Devon said, you know, just concentrate on your translations or something, you know.
Engin Terzi: and yeah i have no idea about the butcher my friend i don't know if there is injury or something i hope not you know i didn't see what ermus tried i have no idea will you also do the behind i will try to do my friend i will do i have to do you know we we talk the behind the scenes you know like it's no fun you know uh net
Engin Terzi: next podcast i don't know i will just now go and then start working for the next one uh yeah we will see dennis and devon podcast here uh no no no fighting no fighting no fighting we are arm wrestling as does does the mma fighters go to the mma fight in the arm wrestle before they
Engin Terzi: We are proud of our brotherhood, right? So we are not going to do anything, you know. We are all friends. Yes, you would make so much hype attention or something, but it's not ethical, you know. I think that kind of thing. No, I don't want those kind of things, yeah. I don't know. Maybe soon, Mask. Maybe soon, yeah.
Engin Terzi: I think Bacho is very strong, very strong, yeah. Wow, that's interesting moments, yeah. Yeah, Denis and Devon will be, yeah, let's see, let's see. If Bobcat in the same podcast, I think he will probably get a little bit heated.
Engin Terzi: I mean, if they are muscle, then we can also set some fights. I'm joking. Hello, Phil. Great to see you, my friend. Great to see you. And so, okay, you all take care and hope to see you with the next one. And so, left foot?
