Engin Terzi: tomorrow table training day let's see hello what's it i'm missing foreigners hello
Engin Terzi: up today two pullers um will be joining they like almost the same you know like they both are very tall and matt probably is a little bit taller and
Engin Terzi: They both are great top rollers. And we will see. We will see how they match. I'm very curious. Hello, Mighty Darius. Thank you, my friend. How are you? Thank you, Ahmad. Thank you. I really don't know how the match is going to go. They both are great top rollers.
Engin Terzi: rank top role in some of the greats um he even traveled uh george swedco um at the 2022 love i was right there you know he troubled him and so we will see the match can go either way thank you mighty darius thank you
Engin Terzi: Serhii Kalinchenko but I saw the match with Matt he's doing very well and his performance against Rambat was just great you know and I see that he is now different physically different mentally different he looks healthier he looks bigger he looks
Engin Terzi: muscular, more confident, and he is like, hey, this is what I see with Matt. And from other side, Frank is very experienced, poor. He's 44 years old, and I remember him like for a long time, you know. Let's see who came. Hello, Matt.
Engin Terzi: How's it going, Engin? Good, good, good, good. How are you? Tired. I was talking about you. I was talking about you. I was saying very, very bad things about you, and you just came here at the same time, you know. Yeah, it's usually how it works, see? Yeah. Yeah, you were very good, you know. I saw you in Dubai. Not the way you performed, but also the way you are built. I don't know. I saw you like...
Engin Terzi: more muscular, physically stronger, the same crazy mindsets and altogether you look very dangerous, look very dangerous.
Matt Mask: Yeah, I was really worried going into it. Just, I wasn't, I wasn't able to really gauge myself prior to that match, just cause I didn't want to push it because I was so beat up from Paul and Sergey. So, so it was, yeah, I never really had a chance to really push. I don't know. I think my weight was probably down a little bit, especially after getting to that heat. That's there. Uh,
Matt Mask: was your weight i think it was more around that 245 mark when i went to compete a little bit less so it's straight around my average weight so and in this event do you plan to be a little bit heavier ah i always want to be heavier again i always want to be heavier so i hope i'll be heavier but we'll see my body has different ideas right but just look at that one look at that one he was like around like
Engin Terzi: maximum 264 or something. And people said that he was too light, you know, he looks so skinny or something like the arm resting, you know, I hope that everyone will understand that it is not about like, you know, having like so much water and just like, big, you know, it's just if your connective tissues, you know, how you're feeling, right? I think Yeah, yeah. If you feel strong, you're strong, you know, you can be
Engin Terzi: much heavier and i'm feeling like a you know you never know about that yeah yeah yeah um i don't know where frank and let me ask okay they are coming he said yeah and yeah i don't know what do you think about your opponent he's he's tall he's top roller have you studied him you know a little bit there's not a whole lot to study on him hey yeah i mean okay what's the conclusion
Matt Mask: uh looks like he's got a thick mitt strong as wrist so it's you know he looks like he's definitely got more of a hole in an opening on the inside but that ain't really my game so yeah yeah if i have to go there i might end up going there so i'm not really sure not really sure what is it this is not easy to hook your meters
Engin Terzi: yeah so well you got to stop him first right so yeah i mean he needs to stop you as well you know you both need to stop each other i really don't know i will ask him now i think he's i'm guessing he's about like six three or something this is my guess and you are yeah i thought he was shorter than that he looks like he's like six foot maybe something but so hard to say
Engin Terzi: do you mean you you don't think he's he's uh he didn't look just in his videos just like off of his height compared to a couple of the opponents that i've seen him go against it didn't look like okay maybe maybe i just remember maybe i have competed so many events with him but maybe i'm mistaken maybe we will ask him now once they come and you are what six six six five six six yeah around there okay yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: yeah it was it was surprising yeah that that I mean the dominance was little surprising like I I gave you the ash I was expecting you to win but I didn't think that it was like that like do you think that anything would have changed you know if you would pull in step with Ron to me it didn't look that way what's that sorry no I mean I mean even if you were in strap against Ron it didn't seem like you know there would be I don't think
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, we hear you. Hello, hello, hello, Frank. Hello, Marzino. Sorry, there was a problem because the Italian Championship is underground. So connection was very bad and a bit of problems. My friend, it was my fault. I was too late about sending the links. Yeah, this is my fault. Sorry about it. And I don't know. Did I make all three in the same screen? Yeah. So we were talking about Frank and then we talked about
Engin Terzi: friend height how tall is frank margin sorry can you repeat i try to uh it's a bit louder yeah yeah just one second we close the doors even on the poster french is just laughing smiling you know so
Engin Terzi: i'm just going to get rid of my dog for a second here yes okay we are moving to a quieter place quieter and please better internet because you are still lagging a little bit okay
Frank Lamparelli: sorry because there is the competition going on so it's like everywhere we go they are at the competition italian championships right now
Frank Lamparelli: Yes, everything went well. First in the right category and now we're waiting for the open category. He easily won and now he's waiting for the open category to face every champion of every category again.
Frank Lamparelli: okay okay if during the during the during the podcast it happens let him just go boom boom beat and come back you know yeah that was one of the problems because it was competing and we have to move the class to make space for the podcast but now we have to do the open after so it's all in between yeah yeah okay okay we were talking about frame how tall is frank
Engin Terzi: is 191 centimeters tall 63. and 113 kilograms 13 kilograms yeah i'm telling you very similar he is a little bit like two inches shorter than matt and they're around the same same weight yeah that's good
Translator/Interpreter: And how is Frank's shape right now? Is he winning? Is he in the category? He's saying that he's in good shape. He doesn't feel pain in any way, in any form. He's very healthy. And the only problem is that he's getting older right now.
Frank Lamparelli: so the only problem is that he always gets older yeah yeah yeah yeah he's very good and he didn't have any problem with anyone in the category yeah how does he see his chances against matt he's saying 50 50.
Engin Terzi: I understand, I understand. And what does he think about his opponent's style at the table? Like I'm not talking about only the police style, but also the electricity he uses around, you know, like he's going to be intimidated by that. As you see, both as a shooter and as an athlete, even if you're more intimidated by how he presents himself, how much gas he uses, let's say. Well, let's say that
Translator/Interpreter: He's saying that pulling wise, he has a very similar style to him. So he knows how much Mask pulls and the table with Spiegel with which one of them is stronger.
Frank Lamparelli: Regarding the persona, he's saying that Matt Mask is very impressive and you can get a bit scared by his demeanor at the table, but he will try to do it nevertheless. Okay, okay. So he's basically saying that he will do his best not to be intimidated. Exactly. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: And Matt, what do you think about your opponent? I asked you, but you said that like not much to know because it's like clear and tall guy, top roller and anything you can add.
Matt Mask: yeah i'm not really sure it's more it only so much you can tell off of watching somebody arm wrestle as opposed to whatever you can tell when you actually grip up to them right so it's uh i'm not really sure sorry matt i didn't hear because he was translating yeah say again yeah
Matt Mask: yeah so it's uh yeah pretty much the only way i'll know for sure is once we actually grip up so it's a guy right now a guy can only guess where he feels that he's more powerful or where his strengths are but until you actually grip up with somebody it's hard to tell exactly where all their strengths and where the angles exactly they're shooting you got an idea but it's completely different watching as opposed to gripping up and feeling it right yeah yeah yeah i see yeah
Matt Mask: Yeah, so it's kind of, you know, so many times in the past, I've tried to study an opponent and tried to think, okay, this is where there's pressure, this is how it's going to feel. And a lot of the times in the past, it's kind of fucked me just because I've always, always one way, this is exactly how it's going to go. And then I get up there and shit feels completely different. So it's more, I've more decided just going to kind of do my thing and adjust them to fly where I need to from there, right? So...
Engin Terzi: I mean, like whenever, whenever basically two top holes is going out, like it is more like who is this risk is handling the pressure, you know, who is this risk is, uh, surviving there, you understand like risk or is different thing, but it's more like, you know, riser into, in the handling the, the, the pressure. Yeah. And we will see, like, it looks like it's obvious that the one that, um,
Engin Terzi: will have strongest like static wrist power will survive this. I don't see personally any of you hooking each other and beating. To me, this is my opinion, but we will see. Yeah, it's very interesting match. And he thinks that your styles are similar. Do you also agree with it or you think it's a little bit different? Yeah, to an extent. To an extent. It looks like he drives a lot more sideways.
Matt Mask: Once he gets a little bit of hand control as opposed to a little more back pressure through the thumb. So there's slight alterations in there, I believe. But almost pretty much guaranteed we're going to be going to the straps, I'm thinking. So see how it feels out of the straps. But I think it's inevitable we're going to end up being strapped up. Yeah. Listen.
Translator/Interpreter: I just have something to say. Can you say it now? Yes, yes, yes. And he has his observation to do. I want to say that we have two things in common. In addition to having the shot, we are both top-rollers. We both lost and won with Ermes Gasparini. So let's say we have that in common, in addition to the shot.
Frank Lamparelli: so he's saying that he's he agree with mask that they are both top roller and all we we decided like in one go because neither of them can pull like in the hook as well and he also said that they have one more thing in common that they both pulled and won and lost against Hermes oh okay yeah okay yeah
Engin Terzi: And can you ask him, you know, stylistically, which one do you think will be harder for Frank, stylistically? Hermes or Mask? I'm not asking about the current Hermes, but I'm not about power either, like the stylistically. If they were equally strong, on a stylistic level, would it be easier for you to beat Hermes or Mask? If they were equally strong, not the Hermes of today.
Translator/Interpreter: It's a difficult question, really, because there, in addition to strength, as you say, Engin really counts the wrist and the speed with which the start takes place. So it would be difficult for me to predict who would really be the strongest, because they both have a very strong wrist, a big, strong hand. It would be difficult if they were the same in terms of style. There is a style that gives you more problems.
Frank Lamparelli: So he's saying that if they were with the exact same strength, so of course not current Hermes, he agrees with you that in a top-roll battle, wrist explosiveness matters a lot. And just stylistically, I think Matt is harder than Hermes as an opponent. Maybe because Matt is... You think Matt is harder because he has a longer hand? Yes, he has a longer hand and a very big hand.
Frank Lamparelli: Yeah, because of his hand and also because of his longer lever. And of course, we know that when two of the brawlers meet, the one with the longer lever has an advantage. Yeah, I understand. And Matt, you know, I know for sure that
Engin Terzi: like coming and winning at the East versus West is, as of now, a little bit different than competing elsewhere. Because I kind of, I may be wrong, that you are coming here to know more to lose. And I kind of feel like,
Engin Terzi: like you know what i mean i mean like you are like you know you have something personal but not the personal with frank but maybe with your own self that you are like not this time is it true or is it just another match oh i want to say not this time but i said that last time i said that the time before too so it's yeah honestly it's just
Matt Mask: I'm sick of fucking losing over in your country. It's about time I get a fucking W over there. So it's, yeah, I, I want this, I want this bad. And also just to, just to solidify, give me that peace of mind that I am going in the right direction. I feel with my training and everything else with the adjustments I've made over the last six months. Right. So.
Matt Mask: so it's yeah it's definitely i want this so bad it's it's you know i'm sure he wants it too but you know i've been there i've done that i know what it's like to lose let's see what it's like to win for once over there right so yeah yeah yeah as i said you know you don't want to i understand that you don't want to talk you just want to do it but inside of you even you don't declare you are like on a some kind of mission about at
Matt Mask: about this time inside everything's boiling okay okay this is what i wanted to know and i was i was guessing yeah yeah yeah trying to say that matt why you want to wait another more time then you can start winning but for just one more time maybe leave it to him yeah maybe this maybe we'll see how bad that wants it hey
Engin Terzi: He's basically telling you to win one more time, right? He's saying that he wants to win just as much as you. Oh, okay, okay. Can you ask Frank how important it is to be on this stage and to compete and win? How important is it to win? How much do you care? Well, I can say that for me it's a great opportunity, satisfaction.
Translator/Interpreter: I hoped to be able to be part of this East-West and it's a great opportunity to shoot with Mask, especially because he is a great character. Then, for me, it will certainly influence a lot the speech at home, which is a particular experience, it is a challenge where I have done much fewer challenges than Mask and he is much more prepared, calmer, calmer, in my opinion,
Frank Lamparelli: So he's saying that he's very, very happy of this chance and he always wished to take part in East versus West because it is really important in his view for the sport.
Frank Lamparelli: He's also very happy to be able to face someone like Matt Mask because he thinks that Matt is a very important figure in the sport and is a very charismatic person. But he's also saying that Matt has an edge because Frank has done way less matches outside of Italy, like one versus one.
Engin Terzi: so he might get some like nervous because this outside of his house um away from italy in istanbul so he thinks that matthew will be more calm than him oh okay i understand about this kind of super match type of event yeah because because we know that frank has been pulling for a long time you know for many years at the wolf at the europeans you know but different different super match this time that's why he is probably
Frank Lamparelli: Frank agrees that it is different a tournament from a super match. He says that it is very different. And Frank, are you going to be aggressive also at the table? Or you will be smiling like right now you are? Always, always. Smile or aggressive? He will always smile. Even if he loses? Even if he loses, he said that he will always smile.
Frank Lamparelli: And then, okay, I understand, yeah. Yeah, it will be interesting. Frank's smile and then Matt, you know, fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking... Katia said the same thing. Katia said the same thing. She said that Frank is, like, very positive, very, always smiling, and it is a very good match against Matt Mask. There are other things that make you angry every day, and certainly one doesn't want to get angry,
Frank Lamparelli: Frank said that since he loves arm wrestling, there are multiple things in life that can make you angry. So since the sport is what he loves, he's always happy because he's doing what he loves and he wants to leave the bad emotion outside. Okay, okay, I understand, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I think we need to wait for the intense match for the East vs West XI when Wagner is pulling Matt. And then I will bring you like this thick steel table, you know, so that they cannot break my table. Did you see what Wagner did to my table, Matt? Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: i've seen what he did i think everybody's seen what he did yeah yeah yeah anyway so uh you just came from dubai and there were some other matches but uh i want to talk about john versus alexey voyvoda match that i saw that you did very like high level praise into john as he deserved what did you think about that match
Matt Mask: i thought it was i thought it was good i think uh i don't think alexi should let it get to his head that just because he lost he should walk away from it i've heard some rumors that he lost i think that in my eyes as big and barley and strong as he is is pretty cowardly i think especially when he was a lot more in the match than what he may have thought he was
Engin Terzi: so i think it was honestly just a couple couple little small errors and adjustments on his behalf and i think i think it could have went the other way for sure so yeah i didn't kind of think that close but yeah i respect your opinion but um i thought that he thought he was gonna win
Matt Mask: Oh, I think he thought we, we all think we're going to win, right? You know, you come out of this, come back into the sport after being gone while you had bought a super match with Tim Dresden six years ago and that you're just going to come back in and start kicking ass and taking names. It's, it's different. There's a little bit more dedication now than there used to be 20 years ago. Right. So you're right. Yeah, for sure. For sure. The price is much.
Translator/Interpreter: higher, you know, if you want to be there when you're older, yeah. And then Frank, what did you think about John versus Alexi match?
Frank Lamparelli: Frank was expecting a draw or a very hard win for John because Alexi was way more nervous. John was calmer and also John never stopped competing. So Alexi was very, he was away from the sport for such a long time.
Engin Terzi: that it makes a big hit on your performance. You are not used to pulling. John is very smart and he never stopped. So he was more ready, more calm, more prepared. I have a question for Matt. Matt, when you saw John competing against Todd and when you saw him, because you were in both competitions, competing against Alexey, did John look a little bit thicker?
Matt Mask: compared to when he played against Todd Hutchings? Just a little bit. I wouldn't say a whole, whole lot. I don't think his weight was much different, but you can definitely see a little more definition into his forearm and into his thumb and hand. Yeah, he was definitely, I think he was definitely more prepared. And I think maybe in his mind, his match with Alexi was more important than his match with Todd, but
Engin Terzi: I'm sure if John can go back, he'd redo that one a little different too, right? Yeah. See, there was one and a half months between two matches. You know, before that, he had some injury with the thumb and wrist. And then when you start preparation, you know, just say that it is a two and a half months of preparation, seriously, or three months. Like when you come to the one and a half months, when you come to the three months, you understand?
Engin Terzi: Sometimes you don't peek at the one and a half months, but you understand what my point is. When you come to the three months, you are more ready. So I kind of tried not to take anything away from Tata, just beat John. That was incredible. Incredible. But I kind of thought that John was a little bit in a little bit better shape against Alexis. I don't know. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so what did you think about the cart, Matt? Did you check the cart, you know, with all the supermashes? I think you've outdone yourself again, Henkan. Just like every other fucking time, when we don't think it can get any better, you manage to pull it off. So, yeah. You know that we do this all together, you know. Listen, when you have incredible ingredients, you know, you make something,
Engin Terzi: incredible you understand and then yeah so this is our sport is beautiful and then not even close to its potential limits right now they've reached so it is normally it gets uh better this will be our uh event poster yeah yeah nice yep anyways yeah right here you're opening this
Engin Terzi: Still smiling, yeah. Anyway, so it will be good. So if you talk about the matches, also you can ask the same thing about the card. How did he like the card? Frank, can you ask him? Because in my opinion, this is probably the best card ever. That's okay. I don't know.
Translator/Interpreter: These challenges that you managed to organize in the last two years, in my opinion, have brought both the old and the new fan of Braccio di Ferro closer, because you have managed to integrate new, current names, but also legends that were about to disappear, but still felt little. By putting these characters in here, you have reactivated the interest of many young people, but also of many people
Frank Lamparelli: Frank is saying that of course it is the most important event of today of armwrestling is the biggest ever but he also mentioned a very specific thing that you manage Engin to bring all the legends
Frank Lamparelli: together with new names. So you were able to fuse together two types of fans, maybe people that weren't following the sport six years ago, and you managed to bring all the athletes, new athletes. So you were able to make all the legends that maybe were stopping pulling and the new guys and the fans of each other now see both sides.
Engin Terzi: So maybe new fans saw old legends and old fans now see new coolers. If armwrestling is growing, coming to a different level, these legends deserve to be part of it today. It would be so unfair to do something without involving them. Altogether we look beautiful.
Engin Terzi: okay sean crowder this is this will be the first time istanbul will see the real wild horse the entire card will be intense thank you for all you do thank you for your support for all the uh fan sports when will the trading cars and shorts be available for pre-order very soon my friends very soon thank you for your super chat in like maybe two days everything will be on the
Engin Terzi: Let's talk about the matches. You know Kamil Jablonski that recently pulled against Dave Sheffy, and he's pulling against Ivan Matyushenko. Artem you familiar with Ivan Matyushenko, Matt? I'm not really, no.
Engin Terzi: Many times, he pulled against Davit Arabuli with left arm. I was expecting a close match, but Ivan just dominated. I don't know if you saw their left arm match. He was just like so quick, three pins. He is a hook puller. His wrist, speed and power.
Engin Terzi: He pulled against Vitaly Laletin in the left arm supermatch. He lost four to... Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He even two times hooked Laletin. It is very, very hard thing to hook Vitaly Laletin, as you know. And so what do you think about this match with Kamil Jablonski with the dead wrist and then... Ah, it's hard to say. It almost looked like his match he had with Prutnik.
Engin Terzi: He pulled Prudnik at the last one, didn't he? Who? No. Prudnik didn't pull last event. I mean, he pulled Dalikian, Prudnik. He pulled left arm Dalikian. I'm so fucking horrible with names right now, Engin. I probably wouldn't be able to tell you. Even if I did tell you, I'd be able to tell you. Yeah, yeah. No problem. No problem. Can you ask Frank? I'm sure he knows both guys. I think Frank pulled in the same events with Kamil Jablonski, I think.
Translator/Interpreter: But what does he think about Ivan Ivan Matyushenko and him? I know Ivan Ivan Matyushenko. He's a left-hander. My left-hander isn't strong, but he's very strong. I think Ivan Matyushenko is one of the best strikers in the world.
Translator/Interpreter: Jablonski is very, very strong. He has that side press shot that in my opinion can be stopped. There is a method to stop it, you have to apply it. But yes, he is very strong. Between the two, in my opinion, Matyushenko wins.
Frank Lamparelli: So Frank said that he knows very well both of them. He pulled with Ivan Matyushenko on the left and sadly Frank's left is nowhere near his right because he has very deep pain. But Ivan Matyushenko was very good and probably, in his opinion, one of the best hook puller ever.
Frank Lamparelli: He also stated that he watched... Just keep it still now, don't forget it. In the hook, he is for sure one of the best, but the hook inability may be the best ever. Frank said that he's perfectly spot on. Probably the best one at hooking people. And he also said that he watched Laletin versus Ivan Matyushenko on the left. He watched the match.
Frank Lamparelli: Regarding Kamil, he said that it is possible to beat Kamil. He has a very good flopper press. There is a clear path on how to beat a flopper presser. But between knowing how to do it and do it, it is a different thing. But in his opinion, Ivan Matyushenko will win. Oh, he thinks that Ivan Matyushenko is going to win. Yeah, Kamil is also very strong. 3-0. 3-0 for Ivan Matyushenko.
Engin Terzi: Oh, 3-0 for Mushing. Okay, I understand. And Matt, I want the score or maybe the percentage of this one. You can even do some analyzing. You know, at least one of the polls is very good. Matt Mask versus Frank Lamparelli. We're starting something new here, so I'm going 3-0 for Mask.
Matt Mask: for the canadian guy okay yeah yeah that guy with the up hand so yeah i think i think he's gonna win so will he will he dominate him uh i don't know if he's gonna dominate him but he's definitely gonna teach him a lesson and give him a rude awaken and what it's like to pull with a guy like matt so okay okay he will remember he will remember you will have yeah he'll remember he'll be he'll be hunting me down
Engin Terzi: be hunting me back down again in a couple years like ermys did yeah yeah on on social media he will be challenging you and you know like hey one more time let's go one more time right yeah okay okay and martino ask ask him martin ask him look at this ask frank what he thinks about this match uh between whom i mean the same match that matt is talking about
Frank Lamparelli: yeah but i can can you repeat the name what did you translate if you didn't know the name i translated what matt said but um i i forgot the the name of the the two guys yeah the other guy is frank lamparelli no no no no
Frank Lamparelli: Even if I lose, I don't hide. Life goes on. Everything is an experience. He said that everything is a new experience and is different from someone else. Even if he loses, he will smile and go on. Life keeps going.
Translator/Interpreter: okay so he he doesn't come here just like i'm gonna win i'm gonna win he just like no no no this is has nothing to do with his prep he will prep like 100 percent like every time but um
Frank Lamparelli: this fact doesn't mean that he's scared of losing or that if he loses, he will like run away. I'm asking his prediction. So he hopes to win. He says it's very hard to predict and he really doesn't know.
Engin Terzi: okay okay let's go to the next one matt like don't be don't be nice you understand uh about this one um david samusha pull five matches at the 85 kilo he won all he won the five times the world title he beat
Engin Terzi: Bozidar Semenov, you remember Bozidar from the Stolski match? And then he beat Daniel Prokopcik. You know Daniel, you know? Yeah. Yeah. And then he beat Greg Tuller. He beat Brandon Ancestor. And then lately he beat Vala from Georgi. It was a very tough match. And do you think that it is possible, this old injured guy, to just come back and just pull right away against the best?
Engin Terzi: or is just he should just like do another one and then go step by step? I think the old cunt has actually been on that level the whole time.
Matt Mask: well he's been behind the scenes promoting all this so i don't think he's really coming from a place where he wasn't on that level in the first place he's been there he's done that he's been there the whole time it's just a matter of him transferring his energy from the promoting side of it to to the competing side and i know myself like to compete and promote an event and run an event all the same day
Matt Mask: all i can say is if you pull this off you're definitely up there with well you definitely are one of the goats 100 percent so it's uh i think right now you got everything going against you nothing going for you but i think that's the best part man that's the best part
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Yeah, if you can, it's the best part. Like, you know how stressful that five, six days before these were stressed there, running there, running here, running there, you know? But I mean, let's say it's the fun, you know? Let's do it, you know?
Engin Terzi: Yeah. So you are saying that looks like, you know, I am underdog here, but if I do it, it will be great. That's what you are saying or? Yeah, 100%. I think going into it, you're the underdog just because what you got on the plate.
Matt Mask: You're not just showing up, getting taken care of fed and got to be here at this time. You're the one that's got to take care of all us retards. Right. So, so yeah, it's, uh, yeah, I think, uh, I think it definitely got your fucking shoot. It definitely got your work cut out for you, but I have faith in you. I think you're going to pull it off, but.
Translator/Interpreter: Yeah, our team to do it. Okay. And Frank, well, how do you see that? I hope the frame is. In tanto, buona fortuna. E poi, beh, è come mettere me contro Massa, voglio dire, mi danno perdente, per una buona percentuale, quindi, però è un'ottima opportunità, solo che
Translator/Interpreter: It's true, it's difficult to organize such an event and then also participate and be focused on the match. So it will be difficult, but you were a champion, you beat many of those characters that I saw in the World Championships win really many times, so in my opinion you should never underestimate. For example, I don't know, if I were to play with you, I wouldn't want to underestimate you, that's it. Do you always give a score that doesn't end? But in my opinion,
Frank Lamparelli: So he said that he saw you winning multiple titles at WAF because he was pulling there as well. And you're a formidable puller. And if he had a match with you, he wouldn't underestimate you. And he also said that
Frank Lamparelli: and it's very difficult because like him versus matt maybe a lot of people don't know him and say that he will lose so you also come in as under under like as favorite and he also said that it's very stressful to organize the event to run it and also to to pull and his final prediction is that you are crazy strong but three two for samusha
Engin Terzi: That's good. That's good. Good, good, good. Thank you for honesty, Michael. Thank you. Thank you. And let's go. Let's go. There are many matches. Let's go, Matt. Irakli Zirakashvili, Rustam Babaiev, 95 kilo. The top-roll master versus hoop master. He can also top-roll as well, Rustam. Rustam is, in my opinion, one of the best ever
Engin Terzi: like Evers, like one of the top 10, maybe top five, you know, like Irakli is a rising star. He usually beats people who try to hook him. He has some losses against the top rollers. Rustam can top roll too, but Rustam will probably try to go inside. We don't know. How do you see this match? Ah, fuck. That's a tough one to call, to be honest.
Matt Mask: yeah it's if yeah like you nailed it right on the head iraqi is the up-and-comer uh his top role is his game sasho the drives in for the hook all the time he usually sinks it too his quick snap into it so it's i don't know it's it's really hard to say sasho's definitely got the shorter arm of the two uh easier to think
Matt Mask: it's i i'm i'm up in the air on this one to be honest so i'm sure uh
Matt Mask: Rustam music is going to be, huh? Okay. Yeah, well, it's hard to say. Well, yeah, who knows? It's very, very hard to talk about. I honestly, I don't know on this one. So, it's, if, yeah, if he can, if he can sink the hook, it's his. If Irakli can't, like, if Irakli can get his hand, then it's going to be Irakli all day long. I don't know if Rustam can do anything if he takes his hand and he can still commit and get his shoulder in behind to follow through, so. Yeah, I don't remember when last time Rustam lose his wrist, but
Engin Terzi: I don't know, but sometimes you don't have to really lose your wrist, but sometimes you just hang the guy on your pronator, just flatten his grip, and then still, but we will see. I don't expect a war, but we will see. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. And how does France see this match? So, you know,
Frank Lamparelli: He's saying 3-1 for Rustam. Maybe a difficult match, even if it will end like 3-1, but still very hard because Urquhart is young, full of energy. But in the end, he thinks that Rustam's versatility will pay off and Rustam will win 3-1. Okay, understood. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Um, there is one guy said that 2023 is, uh, we are at Dobrin's prime. He won the WAF. No, my friend, he won the WAF in 2021 as well. When I beat him, I beat him 5-0 and then same year he won the WAF also in Romania. Anyway, so let's go, let's go to do another one. Um, Frank, you know about these pullers because you many years pull at the
Engin Terzi: uh wow or let's start with uh matt that is back matt sarah beckman versus egla white who sorry egla egla from lithuania egla for so many years you know was the best female like with left arm and with right arm irina makewa was better uh like exactly 10 years ago i organized a super match over here
Engin Terzi: And there was John Brzenk Trasimir and Karolina Pettersson, Victoria Olushina pulled. And also Sarah Backman and Egle pulled. And Egle beat Sarah then easily 5-0. But now not 2013 anymore, it's 2023. And we saw, we see Sarah is incredible shape, but Egle is also training like crazy. And do you know Egle actually?
Engin Terzi: A little bit, yeah. Egle is the one that lost against Gabriela at the East vs. West World title. I don't know if you were in the same event or not, but I think you were at the East vs. West 5? When everybody came, Gary Goodrich and everyone came? Yeah, I was there at 5. Okay, yeah. I think it was the event that Gabriela and Egle pulled, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah. Okay.
Matt Mask: Maybe I'm mistaken. I don't know. I don't know. Whatever. I mean, she was on that card. She was right. Yeah, she wasn't on that card. I think the only the only one where Sarah was. I think she was in East versus West. I was was number one. No, I'm talking about Egle. Oh, yeah. I don't see her on the shirt.
Engin Terzi: Okay. Okay, then they put in the previous one is versus was for others. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Anyways, so if you don't know, do you still want to say something about it or want to skip?
Matt Mask: Uh, no, I, I think, I think Sarah's on a completely different mission right now. Uh, it seems like she's getting all her shit healed up everywhere where she's been hurting in the past is all starting to come together. And, and Sarah, like a lot of us are, she fucking hates to lose. Like it really, it pisses her off when she loses. I think, I think she's got a lot more that she wants to show. So I believe Sarah wants it bad.
Matt Mask: I think she wants it more than Egle. So I definitely got to go with Sarah. I think it's going to be a hell of a match. It's been 10 years since they pulled, but I think Sarah is at a completely different level and a lot more smarter than she ever used to be, right? Yeah. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. Egle is also very experienced. Also, Egle wasn't happy when she lost against Gabriela because Egle hasn't lost to Gabriela before. That was the first time.
Engin Terzi: So Egle is also feeling like hurt. And then she also wants to prove something. I think it will be an incredible clash. This is- It should be fireworks, eh? Yes, yes, yes. Listen, if there is an event and we talk about firework, and if you are in that event, you are the firework. Yeah, yeah, sometimes, sometimes. No, you win or you lose, you know? Sometimes I blow up and sometimes I blow shit up.
Translator/Interpreter: Always fun, always fun, yeah, to watch you. Frank, how do you see Egle versus Sarah?
Frank Lamparelli: He's saying that Sarah may look in terrific shape but just because she just came back from an injury and he hopes that Sarah doesn't become angry at him for this. He thinks that Egle is the favourite because Sarah may not be completely healed from her past injuries. I think Sarah was
Engin Terzi: Sarah's injury was with the right arm was like from the WR time, you know, like 2019 or something. I think she had recent injury with the left side, as far as I know. Yeah. I know Sarah's been visiting Dr. Mask and he's been pumping her full of stem cells. So I don't know if that injury even exists anymore. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Frank said that he's sure of one thing, that if it is a beauty competition, Sarah takes it. And let's go to another female match that probably you guys both know very well. Irina Gladkaya versus Fia Isaac.
Engin Terzi: Matt, you start. What did you say? Irina, Irina, Irina Gladkaya. Okay. You know her? Who's she pulling? Fia Reissig from Sweden. Oh, fuck. That's going to be a good match, too. They faced each other many times in the past, though, haven't they? Yep, yep, yep. And if I'm not mistaken, I think Fia's come on top. With left, more often. No, with left, she had more. With left, with right, Irina won more.
Engin Terzi: Oh, really? I thought it was the other way around. I think the last time they pulled, I think Fia beat Irina right arm. As far as I remember, 2018 WAF, I think in Antalya. Yeah. But that is Fia right now is just like absolute dominant figure, you know, under 70 kilo. And she fires that shit up too, eh? She gets fired right up on the table. Trust me, they will be like, you know, they will be like...
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Yep. Yeah. It's going to be, I don't know. It's going to be interesting. And Anna's doing a shit ton of fucking groundwork for you. No, no, no, no, no, not Anna. Irina. Irina Glatkaya. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know Irina Glatkaya from Russia? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe you guys call him Irina or something. Irina Glatkaya. But it's like Irina in Russian. I think that's how they read. You don't know her? You know, right? Yeah. No, I know who she is. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep.
Matt Mask: and i i i think i think fia fia is on a tear right now i have to go with vo on that one so i think i think we might see three one three one that's my guess yeah and there's a comment i saw the guys this i don't know when he pulled kalishenko after probably after probably
Engin Terzi: like some break, you know, he came like, he stopped like minimum, like seven, eight months or a year or something. And then I think he only trained two months and then put, pull Kalnyshenko only with two months. You know, I just called him. He said he wasn't training. And then I said, two months later, would you pull Kalnyshenko? He said, yeah. So the Zeranova that we saw against Kalnyshenko and the latest Zeranova we saw are just like,
Engin Terzi: this much difference. Um, and, and what do you think about their match? We are, I think we're just getting a lot higher. Uh, right. Oh, he's saying a three, one for you now. Okay. Matt says fear.
Engin Terzi: and then francis irina gladkaya okay let's see let's see how it will go yep and then let's go some of the big guys really big guys zaor paizule versus georgie swedco matt you know both guys you know both yeah yeah yeah fuck zaru he's a fucking big beast isn't he he's a big man
Matt Mask: Both of them. Both of them. Both of them are big, big men. So both like the top role.
Matt Mask: It's going to be interesting. It's going to be very, very interesting. Zaur, it almost looks like he may have the longer leverage. I'm not really sure on his height. He looks like he's a lot taller and bigger. Maybe it's just deceiving from the pitchers and everything. But, yeah, it's hard to say. Jordan, he's on a fucking – he's on a war path right now himself with that right arm, right? So, but –
Matt Mask: back yeah it's dude that's I'm interested I'm super excited to watch that one so and I'm glad mine's gonna be one of the first matches so then I can sit back and watch the rest of them going on right so I mean if this is what how you want but it's just totally up to you you know like where the match so you are saying that it is you don't have any prediction
Matt Mask: I I'm going to say just because just because of the performances I've seen recently, I'm going to have to go with Georgi on that one. Oh, OK. OK. Yeah. So because because they're observed pulled in what the Russian Open or something like that not long ago.
Engin Terzi: Zaur is pulling AMC event, Zaur was dominating AMC event and then Zaur tore his bicep and then somehow like four months later or something for five months later he just competed AMC again and he took second to Vitaly Laletin but he lost to Slayev and then he came he
Engin Terzi: Fadi Bardawil, Ph.D.: So I want to let it in and then he beats live is our best live in the final he goes to knowledge, he lost his list easily, but he was not easily being maybe like. Fadi Bardawil, Ph.D.: 10 seconds, we are near 10 seconds he just resisted, but he lost but again he was he was just right after he tore his bicep I don't even know how he came in full.
Engin Terzi: This time I set him and he said, and you set me with a very tough guy. He said, he thinks that Georgi Swetko with right arm is stronger than both Hermes and Devon. This is what he's thinking. So we will see. But did you know that they pulled before and then Georgi beat him? 2021 Waffles, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Zaur attack and he lost his wrist. Georgi got the control, Zaur got a foul. The same thing, Zaur attack and then he lost his wrist. Georgi came and another foul. Georgi won on fouls, but he had the complete control. I don't think that Zaur could go anywhere on that day. And how do you see that match, Frank? It's a match between two dinosaurs, so it will be spectacular.
Translator/Interpreter: with Georgi in Istanbul two years ago. So he's very strong. In my opinion, Georgi wins. A 3-1, probably. In my opinion. I don't know Zawadul very well. I've seen him on the videos, but I'm in favor of Georgi. Also because, I repeat, I took a shot with him at the World Cup. After that shot,
Frank Lamparelli: so he's saying that he knows zaur and he has seen zaur competing but mostly only on video and this is a match between like two dinosaurs but he faced georgie in istanbul um
Frank Lamparelli: At WAF and he said that Georgi was crazy strong. They had a very tough match and he was very tired after and instead Georgi went on and beat everyone at competition like nothing.
Frank Lamparelli: So he thinks that Georgi is very strong because even though he has hard matches, his endurance is great. And he's saying 3-1 for Georgi because he knows Georgi better than Zaur and he thinks he's very strong. I understand. And let's talk about quickly, last a few matches and finish. Can you ask him Sasho versus Artem Taino, left arm?
Engin Terzi: frank yeah sasha versus artentino he's saying sasho sasho is gonna win do you know uh matt do you know uh not really i know about sasho yeah he's been out of it for a while he came back in didn't just have a match with rvg not long ago
Engin Terzi: Oh, yeah, it was long ago, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Two years ago or something. Completely dominated him. Yeah, yeah. Is this going to be a left-hand or right-hand match, though? This match is left-hand. He recently pulled against Pauline. You remember at the East versus West? Paul was winning 2-0 and then 3-2. Sasho won, yeah. But this guy, Artem Taino, I don't know. Did Frank compete 2021 Waffles in Romania?
Translator/Interpreter: I was in the Masters category, then I went to the left. Do you remember Taino with Sasho left-handed? Yes, I remember. But I preferred Sasho in this match.
Frank Lamparelli: Yeah, he said that he knows very well the puller and it wasn't a prediction just on guts or feeling, that he has thought about it and he still gives Sancho as the favourite, even though he was there and he remembers kind of a win. Yeah, but it was after Sancho had some tough pull with Flam and Dimitro.
Matt Mask: It's very different between tournament and supermatch. Supermatch. Okay, I understand. Okay, let's go last three supermatches and then we finish. Tatashins versus Ongarbaev, Matt. That's going to be a good one too. Super stoked to watch that one. Fuck. The side pressure king versus the fucking ninja. My God.
Matt Mask: I'm goodbye. Every fucking time I've watched that guy fall, he impresses me more and more and more every single time. The way he moves on that table, the finesse, his ability to transition through one position to another. Todd, we know where Todd's going, right? Todd's going just pretty much straight at him.
Matt Mask: fuck i think i think this is probably going to be todd's probably toughest fucking match he's had and i would say the last couple years besides when he pulled prudnik
Matt Mask: is is is my guess just because just under bio's ability to build a transition all over that table uh i really want to see todd clean sweep them but i really don't know i i'm rooting for todd do you expect do you expect a war who doesn't matter whoever wins because
Engin Terzi: has like very strong up inability while ongar baby is more like you know like not like you know unless you go into him like this if he's if you are pulling him he is also pulling from the other side he's not really like blocking your pronator like like uh
Matt Mask: I think that's where it hurt Todd when he turned him this way. Todd was trying to side pressure him this way as opposed to his regular side pressure. I don't know whether Uncle Bob was going to be able to do that or manipulate him in that. But the thing is,
Matt Mask: on goodbye can hit him in six different directions within the matter of four seconds right so it's you know what i mean like todd goes to adjust the one all of a sudden bang he's hitting him in another direction right so it's yeah i think it's gonna be a lot of back and forth i think if
Matt Mask: i think if i'm going to buy up doesn't fully commit his shoulder and kind of block that side pressure i think you're going to see todd get a couple in there but on the buy of in my mind right now probably one of the smartest arm wrestlers on the planet just his ability his maneuverability i i think he todd's going to get him once but uncle is going to adjust
Matt Mask: Turn around, get a win, maybe two wins. You'll see Todd adjust again, and then Angubayev will just turn around, switch again. I'm thinking 3-2 for Angubayev in my head. My heart says 3-2 for Todd, but my mind's saying 3-2 for Angubayev. Do you expect a historical match? I think it has the potential to be probably the best match of 2023, in my mind.
Engin Terzi: yeah this is something that i am i am like suspecting but i'm not sure but i i cannot see either of them really dominating i kind of feel the match is going to start somewhere and once it's stuck i don't see it is moving somewhere quick no no and and i don't see every match
Matt Mask: any of the matches being the same as the previous match. I think every match is going to be slightly different. They're going to pull in at slightly different angles and different attacks and everything else throughout. So I think there's going to be a shit ton of adjustments on the fly between both opponents. Yeah, I'm getting nervous while I'm just trying to imagine. I'm getting nervous about that match. Frank, what does Frank think?
Translator/Interpreter: Well, Ongarbaev is a friend. I won with him in Zagabia six or seven years ago when it was a new entry. Now I lost with him at a Zloty Tour in the Open Class and I can say that he has improved a lot, he is very strong, he knows how to share your thoughts,
Translator/Interpreter: He said that he pulled with Ongarbaev and he beat him.
Frank Lamparelli: but also the second time he met Ongarbaev in that Zloty Tur final in the open class, sorry, in open class, Ongarbaev avenged his loss and was way more strong than the previous time that they met and Frank won. And he says that he agrees 100% with what Mask said because Ongarbaev is such a versatile puller that he can pull like in every position. So it is very difficult to,
Frank Lamparelli: beat him because you have to be like way stronger than him to be able to to beat him because the the technical gap is very very fast in switching techniques so finding one lane is not enough yeah we don't go away because he will do something different here you're right yeah if you find one lane he changes yep and let's go to the sasha versus uh john bersing matt
Matt Mask: Fuck, we were all rooting for John on this one, right? Every one of us is rooting for John. What I've seen of John's last couple matches.
Matt Mask: i think sasho is a bad card for john ray now just stylistically just for where where it looks that john has been a little more vulnerable it looks like john's been a little more vulnerable on the inside but i yeah but listen i need to cut you who who hook john recently who was able to hook john recently john john loses
Engin Terzi: to Iraq with the deadliest, John loses to
Matt Mask: uh on that way while losing his hand and then he lost to todd like i don't remember somebody just boom not so much driving in on him but sasho has the ability to build to drive in on him the way that uh the way that alexi was cutting in not really sure the level that alexi's at right now the way alexi was getting in getting that ball it looks like john john struggled a little more
Matt Mask: yeah attacking his arm as opposed to just coming out on his hand with him right so and sasha is 100 you know where he's going and you know you know how fast he is at getting there john is also a master manipulation on being able to take the hand with complete hand control so it's i i think if sasha can get the jump on him and john doesn't get the hand position that he needs to build the clock block
Engin Terzi: that hook from Sasho, I think it's going to be a bad day for John. Yeah, but do you realize that you're talking about Alexi? Alexi is rich and Sasho is rich. Alexi is about 25 centimeters, almost 10 inches taller than Sasho.
Engin Terzi: understand like yes yes sasho is very strong hard to take his risk he always maintains but he doesn't have that reach that alex is like this we're talking about guys like this much of the way the height difference you know yeah but i'm thinking i'm thinking on the speed wise yeah yeah he will be his tight pressure i think i think sasho's pop in there is a lot quicker than 90 of the people in that category so yeah
Engin Terzi: the thing is that john's shoulder because sasha's you know side hit with the spinated you know forearm like this it is i don't know how much how much john's shoulder will handle if john's shoulder handles and that's that's what i mean not so much the inside poland but just that side pressure angle where he really has to commit the shoulder that's where he's kind of been a little more vulnerable right yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: There is a super chat for you before that. Michael said, thank you for your super chat. Can you ask Matt about his shape right now compared to his prime? I kind of feel, it's not a question to me, but you may be in your prime as of lately, but we will see.
Matt Mask: Yeah, it's really hard to say. I feel I'm starting to come back into my own. Definitely getting a lot closer. If not, I'm starting to exceed where I feel I was, but it also feels like
Matt Mask: level is different compared to when i felt i was in my prime i'd say where i felt the best was when i went to pull marcio barbosa at wl i think it was bible or 502 or something like that that's where i felt physically the best coming into a match but
Matt Mask: the level from then to now, it's a different fucking level. So, and I don't know, I really, I think I'm definitely starting to come into the best form where I've ever been personally myself. So, but it's,
Matt Mask: I performed better in the past, but the level has shifted slightly a little bit more into a more serious direction. It was still kind of a bit of a hobby back then. Now it's it's almost a fucking a career, right? So yeah, it's just today is the toughest, toughest rally to check, you know, like if you really want to see where you are, you know, that that's the stage, you know, that that is 100%. Yeah, you cannot get any tougher than that.
Frank Lamparelli: Frank, how do you see John versus Sasho mesh? He's saying that he's such a fan of John that even if he thinks that Sasho is in a very good shape,
Engin Terzi: and it will be very, very hard for John. He's hoping so hard that John will win, that he's going to say that John will win. Okay, I understand. And let's go to the main one, what it's all about. I shouldn't say that, but Denis Cyplenkov versus Devon Larratt. Matt.
Matt Mask: Ah, my brother's on a completely different fucking level compared to everybody right now. And it seems like he's on a projectile going back up his last loss that he suffered against
Matt Mask: against Gennady. That's the word I was looking for. Sorry, still a little tired. Only two hours of sleep. His last loss to Gennady, I think, has lit a fire underneath his ass that we haven't seen in a while. He's coming in a lot more of a smarter puller. Denis is Denis. I don't think he is where he used to be. I think the old Denis would definitely be a bad day for Devon, but
Matt Mask: this this new dentist that we have and this new devon that's immersion right now into the world i think it's going to be a bad day for dennis myself but do you do when you say like bad day do you expect a full domination or do you think i don't expect a whole domination i think endurance
Matt Mask: I think endurance is definitely going to play a huge factor. Devon's ability to be able to maneuver on the table more and pull in different positions is definitely going to help him, obviously in the long run on it. I think Denis is definitely going to surprise. I think he's going to get Devon in some deep water, but Devon's ability to be able to adjust and adjust the level that I think Devon is getting to and where he's at right now, I think it's going to be too much for Denis right now.
Engin Terzi: hmm i understand do you expect that you know if they like if dennis stops you i don't know if you are watching his recent videos but he is doing that open on top roll not really like this but like open on top yeah he's walked right and do you think that you know like if he somehow stops devon but so open arm you know a little bit outside of his shoulder laying you know his hand do you think that devon may ending up with
Matt Mask: press? No, no, I don't think he's going to go into that position just because I don't know. I mean, he will not need. I think I think he's just going to I think if it comes to that, you're just going to see him rise and re grip and rise and re grip and rise and get in the position and then from there be able to come outside of his hand more kind of kind of very similar to how he did with Michael Todd, except it's going to be a lot more wrenching back this way, I'm thinking. Mm hmm.
Engin Terzi: So you are saying that there is no way today they want to lose against Denis? I don't think so. No, I don't think so. I think another six months to a year, it could be a different story. But I'm thinking right now, no, I don't think he's going to. I don't think that is going to lose to him. So. And there is a super chat for Frank before I ask the same question. Thank you for your super chat. Hi, Frank. Did you train specifically for Matt?
Translator/Interpreter: You asked if you would train something specific. No, I think I will train as I trained when I trained with Hermes or Manuel. Mainly my training is always to improve my top run and I think that will be the direction I will try to improve, especially also
Frank Lamparelli: He said that he will focus on training for his top roll and on his hand because the hand is like the major part for the top roll and he will train like when he trained for Hermes or Manuel Battaglia.
Frank Lamparelli: And he will not change his training completely, but he will focus a bit more on the top row, on the hand, because there is such an important role on the hand in the top row. Okay. And can you ask him his opinion about Denis? For me, I think he will win. He will have more resistance. But I see more of a victory from Denis.
Translator/Interpreter: So he's saying that Devon is more versatile and the whole match will be based on endurance and he's stressing very hard
Frank Lamparelli: the endurance part so he's saying that yes his prediction but it all comes down to endurance so in his opinion Devon is way more versatile but um and he can pull in different angles but Denis is Denis and is very strong so he can see a 3-2 for Denis but it will all come down to endurance
Engin Terzi: So, Baba, listen, if he's talking about endurance and if he's saying 3-2 for Denis, so does he think that Denis has better endurance than Devon? He said that they are very close in endurance level, so the match will tell.
Frank Lamparelli: Okay, okay. Anyway, so, Frank, do you have any message for your opponent? For Matt? Buona fortuna! Good luck and the best one will win. And you, Matt? Hang on, it's going to be a hell of a fucking ride.
Engin Terzi: And Matt, do you think that your opponent being like so happy looking, so less like stressed, will it make your F-bomb level a little bit down or you think it will not affect?
Matt Mask: No, I don't think it's possible for me to tone that shit down. It was a bit when I was pulling Ron, but yeah, especially getting back to Istanbul, competing on the stage at East versus West, I don't think there is a motherfucker on the planet that's going to be able to calm me down when they call my name to the table. Okay, so we will see the wild horse, huh? Yeah, full fucking tilt. Yeah, get your spurs on, saddle up, and
Matt Mask: fucking she's gonna be fucking fucking the whole time so yeah okay that i can guarantee you is gonna happen you have to you have to wish him good luck because right now he has the open class of wally italy so he has to win so if you win against him your win will be will look better yeah well just make sure you don't fucking injure yourself or hurt yourself because i don't want any excuses if it goes my way
Frank Lamparelli: He's saying that it has been 10 years that he has been winning this day, so he will repeat it and he will not injure himself.
Engin Terzi: so so come november 12th you guys should all be able to call me the italian champion of the world right yeah okay what what was his answer will he we will will they will they will you guys call him the italian champion when he means that he's gonna be frank the overall champion
Frank Lamparelli: If it will make Matt happy, yes. But he has to learn how to smile. Okay, so if he learns how to smile, he's going to lose against him? I said that if Matt wins, he will call him Italian champion, but Matt has to learn how to smile properly. Okay.
Matt Mask: If it goes the way I want it to, you ain't going to be able to beat the smile off my face afterwards.
Engin Terzi: Gerard, what kind of notes I'm making? Frank has to go because they called the open class. Thank you very much, Frank. Thank you very much, Matt. And very soon, next week, we will see you guys and then we will have some fun all together. Take care. See you in five and a half weeks. See you in Istanbul. Take care. Take care, brother.
