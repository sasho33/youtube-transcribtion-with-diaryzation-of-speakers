Engin Terzi: If you guys speak Russian, nobody will understand. There is no translator. There is nobody. It's just, yeah. We have more people and more weight. He speaks English.
Levan Saginashvili: oh my god so how is everything leon you're feeling good um i don't know um i'm not trying when i started
Engin Terzi: don't you think that like with a few kilo some blood pumping is better than full rest no no no max say no oh okay nothing huh he said uh 14 days rest and
Evgeny Prudnik: during this 14 year days we got the injection special and the 40 for 40 day for 40 40 yeah four zero four zero four oh 40 40 40 yeah he need the rest and after uh he start this with a light weight slowly slowly you know you're talking about stem cell yes
Levan Saginashvili: Okay. For the best results, I need to rest for 40 days. Slowly, slowly. Yeah. During your injury with right arm and now you already had the left arm injury as well.
Engin Terzi: you don't do anything right even even before this stem cell we didn't do any like bench press nothing well repeat please no i mean i mean after you get injured like i know you didn't train anything with wrists but you didn't train anything at all nothing like tricep or bench press yeah i tried but on bench
Levan Saginashvili: On bench... Not trauma because of your wrist right here, yeah. No, on bench press my shoulder is very, very pain. On left shoulder? Yeah, left shoulder is very, very pain. When I pull on left my... my left wrist is not pain but it is not strong. You know, I cannot...
Levan Saginashvili: When I train in the left wrist, it is not a problem. No, I have no problem. But in the left shoulder, it's very painful. When I do back press, when I do biceps, for a long time, it's very painful. Devon, with your left side, how many injuries do you have? Do you have some wrist and shoulder?
Levan Saginashvili: I have wrist, shoulder and wrist. Oh, outside. Lateral epicondylate, yeah. Yeah. And actually I don't know why so much problems in the left hand, because... With your left arm you were always so dominant, you know. Yes, and when...
Levan Saginashvili: My problem after wrist. Yeah. After wrist, when I training shoulder this, I not pull, pull on left hand, but problem, this would be problems.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, but did you, did you, did you not even do some rehabilitation training because you don't compete, you didn't do anything? I do, I go, I always, I all the time, I try to lift, but progress is zero. I don't know why. Yeah. Hello, Ernest. How are you, my friend? Hello. I'm fine. You? All right. I'm not good. How are you?
Levan Saginashvili: Good, good. You wish better. Two days ago, two, this, yesterday I, little bit. Big problem, big problem or? I have the, here are some, I don't know what is, and doctor. How, how happened?
Levan Saginashvili: I want to be honest. You remember her in right arm on this finger. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. I remember. The doctor. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Deleted her. And the wrist? The wrist, I wait. I wait when I...
Engin Terzi: When Max say starting priming, I'm priming and we will see what happen. Good or not good. I hope it is good. I hope. You are expecting to be ready next spring, right? What? You are expecting to be ready.
Engin Terzi: Next year, spring, around like springtime, you know, like April, May. Yes, yes, yes. I want and I bid. Do you think with the left arm you will be ready as well? Oh, actually, it is my dream. Your dream, yeah. I hope.
Levan Saginashvili: Levan, I have a question for you. If both are very healthy, which arm is stronger or what's stronger? When I started armwrestling, my right arm was stronger. But 10 years ago, I had a match with Gennady on Georgi.
Levan Saginashvili: National Championship and I pinned my right hand. And after that my left hand is good progress, very strong and right arm is
Levan Saginashvili: you know, when you have your problem is not so good. One tournament is, I can pull very good, but after the second tournament, maybe it is speed and I'm not good, you know. But five years ago, this problem is cancelled.
Levan Saginashvili: and right arm is back, you know. But left, my left shoulder and biceps always be very, very strong. Very, very strong and I associate for my problems in left.
Engin Terzi: I mean, from other side, right arm competition is always harder than the left arm competition. Like not everyone, like there are in, like you go find 10 people, like eight people are stronger with right arm and two people are stronger with the left arm compared to their other arm, you know? So right arm competition is always tougher. And then when you compete tougher competition, it is always, you are getting also stronger.
Engin Terzi: and but from other side you are getting more damage you know because all the time worse i remember with left arm you usually dominated your class with right arm sometimes you had some wars you know sometimes because i have you know i have here problem and okay not so good yes do you still have that problem no no i in the past problem uh um
Levan Saginashvili: I do. You know, after training, always, every day, I put here ice. After that, it is... Yeah. There are a few Super Chats. Michael, workspace change for your Super Chat. Hello to all legends. Engin, Lewan, Hermes, and Prudnik, thank you, my friend.
Engin Terzi: Alireza legends ending keeps killing it with these lives. Hermes just got done at the gym with his prescribed workout. Is he your student? And.
Engin Terzi: Trip Wars. Yeah. You ever pull against each other one time, right? Or like in Zloty, 2012, 13? 13. 13? Yeah. How was the match? One time you won and one time he won or what? No, no. He won two times. He won two times? Yeah. Oh. You won pretty much.
Hermes Gasparini: The first match it was a little bit harder for me because I opened it with a bit of... You remember? And the semi-final was with Maxime. Yeah, like this.
Engin Terzi: Now we do like with you like this. Yeah, now 20 kilo difference between them. So I don't think it will be fair match. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter? Wow.
Hermes Gasparini: How much I paid you now again? What's your weight? Weight? 105. And you are 130, Hermas? 20 now, 25, 26. Yeah, 20 kilos. Very super clean now. Yeah, yeah.
Evgeny Prudnik: Right, right, right. It's a good pump for me. Very good pump for me. Yeah, I think he's saying that you would be a good warm-up for him. Me? Yeah. We can try. We can try whenever he wants.
Engin Terzi: Okay, I will tell you something. There is one thing common with you guys. Can you tell me? There are probably more than one, but there is something that is common. You all three pulled Devon Larratt for the title. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Rudnick pull for 115 kilo title, you pull for the super awake before that Levan pull to be number one in the world. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And how is, how is, how is your shape right now, Hermes? Feeling good? Yes. Now I started to train a lot of my
Hermes Gasparini: my wrist and my rise everything the way it is growing up i'm very happy about this yeah yeah it was only to restart to training a little bit
Hermes Gasparini: Because when I started resting, my hand was stronger than my arm. Now it's the opposite. I don't train my hand because I thought, yes, my hand is already stronger, it's better to train my bicep more like this. It was a mistake. For the match like Devon, like this,
Engin Terzi: Another top roller, you need to train a lot this part. Okay. The question is, okay, guys, right before this podcast, I was doing isometric training. I put a belt to my pull-up bar and then I hang it from here like this, my body part, and then the belt broken. And then I hit my head and my neck. Now it's just so much hurting, you know.
Engin Terzi: So like, I'm a little bit like dizzy a little bit. I think I will go hospital after this, but not now. But, um, so, uh, Hermes, you think that if you ever meet Devon again, this time you will be ready for him? Yeah. Yeah. If, uh, you will, you will like, you will beat him in your opinion?
Hermes Gasparini: For sure it will be a good fight. Because I think he is very smart in the set-up. He doesn't want to give you your position. It's very difficult. But we need...
Hermes Gasparini: a very strict referee next time. But for sure, if we have maybe two, three months to train a lot this part, it will be better for sure. I think that you better not pull him before another year, you know, maybe end of next year or something. Yeah, like this, I think, yeah. Yeah, yeah. And there are
Engin Terzi: um very quickly i will ask if you superchats uh tell uh isabowa levan wants a warm-up match or super heavyweight world champion match levan when you come back do you want to directly pull for the world title or you want to do a warm-up warm-up match before no world title
Engin Terzi: You want directly the title match, right? Yes, of course. He has already won the title. No, because he is away for more than one year. He lost. Is it Hammer? Hammer is different, yeah. I'm talking about the world title. I think, like Denis, he has the Hammer for three or four years and he doesn't compete with nobody.
Engin Terzi: I think after one year and a half, maybe maximum two years, if you don't compete anymore, you need to give the armour to someone, I think. I'm interested in the East versus West in my belt, so it's a different subject. I think this is between Devon and other people. Hi, Engin. I make pasta every day now, like Hermes.
Engin Terzi: And triple, can we see 115 kg Hermes versus Prudnik in East versus West 12? I don't think that you're going to go down to 150 kg, right, Hermes? No. No, I don't, yeah. Drew Navani. Could Levan have beaten prime Denis? Denis lived very, very high. Okay, there is a question for you. Could you beat Denis in his prime? That's what they are asking. The super chat.
Levan Saginashvili: I have not machine for this. Time travel? No, yes, but I think I beat him in always how it
Levan Saginashvili: I can beat him in his prime or prime. I don't care. So this is not about the Denis, but it is about that you believe yourself that you could beat anyone in the history. You believe that you are the best ever in the history. His prime, he, I don't know, he lose with,
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, but it was after Pushkar and he killed each other. Whenever you're tired, you finish it. When you pull in tournament, when you're tired and not tired, it's your problem. But it was Supermatch, you know. He didn't pull tournament. In Supermatch, he lost with John Six-Zero and he won Michael Todd.
Engin Terzi: I think losing to John was before his prime, and then beating Michael 4-2, I think it was after his comeback. No, no, not comeback. Yeah, I think 2016 or something, you know, I think his prime was, to me,
Hermes Gasparini: like 2012, 11, 13, you know, around those years, but... I remember, I remember when he fought Iliyev. You remember, Enki, when...
Engin Terzi: really ever started in the beginning he he won like with him like like now oh yeah yeah yeah see following you i think it is shaping what he was in this prime very strong very strong yeah yeah arsene told me that but arsene also said that arsene believes that levan would be prime dennis this is what he also said that youtube podcast he said that levan is the strongest super heavyweight in the history this is what arsene said but arsene also said that he went to
Engin Terzi: event either lotoshino or a1 or something just to beat uh dennis and then he said that he was in incredible shape and he hit dennis as he never hit anyone else what's wrong and then there is being like this that video you remember that arson said that next day he was he had pain everywhere his shoulder arm and then he said like he felt like a like a truck hit him you know like he was just so do you you saw the man he was like
Hermes Gasparini: like this yeah yeah stronger than danish for the for the leverage of the hand and the technique maybe maybe maybe the king mover maybe can give some problem to everybody
Levan Saginashvili: When Antenis has a problem, when he pulls, he always tries to move because his arm is not open, you know. Yeah, like when I fought with Dave Chaffee, it was a king move. And you, what's this, Levan? We will see.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm not sure if Denis will ever be come back to his prime, but yeah, hopefully we will see someday the matches and Evgeny, your right arm has been injured and now you are coming back and you told me that you are ready to finally compete with right arm as well. And when you come back, are you ready for a really tough challenge or you want to do a little bit like
Engin Terzi: one level below match? I think one level below. Okay, so, okay, yeah. Yeah, I understand. And today you told me that you are ready to compete against Davit Dadikian. And do you really believe that Davit Dadikian is just one level below? Because Davit Dadikian, he kind of dominated correctly. And
Evgeny Prudnik: do you think that david may not be one level below but just right after maybe i think yeah he was what
Evgeny Prudnik: I have a question for you. If Dadikin and Ongarbaev would put
Engin Terzi: Who has the winning chance? I think Ongar Bayev. You think Ongar Bayev? Because Ongar Bayev had some tough problem with Irakli, especially I think round two when Irakli took him here. While I don't remember Dadikian's arm going past the center, he was always here and here. In the first round it was.
Engin Terzi: You mean the first round? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, he was like at the center, you know, he was like, I don't think he came down here. They were like stuck at the middle, you know, they couldn't go and there was a foul and then after that he just won the rest of the matches. This is how I remember at least, yeah. Yeah, I understand. So you are saying that
Engin Terzi: um you are saying that you are ready but not just directly for the title match but but you basically said that you are ready for that we will see i think in the 105 uh maybe just uh for me uh will be not comfortable comfortable huh
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Do you remember your weight? Do you remember your weight when you competed against him at top eight? Is that true? You were 112 kilo? 111. Yeah, I think Mazgan Shamiev told me that Ongarbaev was like only like 97 or 100 kilo or something.
Evgeny Prudnik: It doesn't matter because on top 8 my wrist was weaker than now. Oh, so now you are stronger? Yeah, but my inside was stronger. For Ongarbaev, very important wrist.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so let's talk a little bit about the upcoming event. And before that, Muhammed Hasan, thank you for your super chat. Hi Engin, can you please ask Levan if he thinks he can crack Devon's wrist? Devon doesn't seem to lose his wrist against anyone except when he was lighter. Do you think you can take Devon's wrist? All right.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. I can take his wrist home. You can? You can take his wrist home, you said? Yes, I can. Yeah, same thing. Can you top roll him? Yes, of course. Yeah? Wow. Levan, I like this about you. You are humble, but you still say your opinion. You are not like, you know,
Levan Saginashvili: Oh, I don't know, I respect him. Yeah, of course you respect him, but whenever I ask you... Devon has a really, very strong wrist, but... I think he's strong here. I can, I can take. If I can not take, I not say I can take, you know. I understand, I understand, yeah, yeah. So you really, you really believe that, yeah. Yes. Yeah, I understand. And...
Engin Terzi: I think there are a few more and then we can talk about the next events. Oh, so many. Very quickly, I will just go through and
Engin Terzi: rush al ghul prudnik versus hermes 115 kg east versus west 11 please set angle and my friend as we said i don't think hermes is gonna go down to under 15 kilo are you planning anything like this hermes no right no he must he must he must lose like 10 10 more kilos and there is
Hermes Gasparini: trip or why doesn't my friend next year the the bed we come back you will see next year the bed we come back here the belt will come to you yeah yeah you will see do you okay the question now devon and dennis are pulling
Engin Terzi: And then most likely since Levan wants directly the shots for the winner. And then Levan is going to pull the winner of this. So now Denis and Devon pull in and then the winner is pulling against Levan. So how are you going to get this belt from who you think? Levan. Okay. So. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I think it's a very, very close match between Devon and Danny. It's very close. We will go there. Devon't go there right now. We will go. You think it's a close match? No, no, no. Let's not finish the draw. We will start from the first matches and then go there.
Evgeny Prudnik: Why doesn't Prudny consider to go to super heavyweight? Why don't you go to super heavyweight, Prudny? They're asking you. Is it because of your weight? Because I choose the clean weight in arm wrestling like it was before, before Top 8. I work full-time clean.
Evgeny Prudnik: good results and now i feel i can repeat it i can back in my new shape clean way clean way so this this is your natural weight you know and then you want to stay whatever you don't want to push yourself to gain weight yeah this is what i understand here um
Engin Terzi: I thank you guys for this support. We thank you for your support. Alireza, three humble giants and the wizard of forearms, Evgeny. Who have you not pulled that you really want to pull? Evgeny, till now, who, like, who do you want to pull between the people that you never pulled before? Amongst the people, maybe John? Or?
Evgeny Prudnik: or uh on the right right hand i mean huh yeah say right now maybe john maybe
Engin Terzi: and rematch with Marat yeah okay that question do you think that if you ever meet him you have chance to beat him Marat I mean if he didn't have chance if he doesn't think that you have chance you wouldn't pull him but like in your head right now can you beat him like
Engin Terzi: Can you imagine yourself stylistically? Did you take enough lessons? Yeah. Yeah? And you... Why this Hermes is smiling, Evgeny? Why this Hermes is smiling? He doesn't believe you. No, no, because the lesson with Devon is it will be to...
Hermes Gasparini: to do a big fight in the setup, I think. To have a lot of endurance in your hand and to take your setup. You understand what I mean? Before then, I didn't pull in a real match with Larratt and I didn't...
Evgeny Prudnik: accept uh except didn't accept uh how to pull with him but now you know and now and now i i know what uh wait from him uh and now i i know what to do what we will do what we will do okay you know what to do right now
Engin Terzi: know what to do right now but what is the chance that you think you can be successful next time knowing something is different successful application is different what is your chance to be successful next time like what is your chance to beat him next time percentage yeah the person uh
Evgeny Prudnik: I think 50-50, but maybe... I think 50-50. Yes. Still 50-50. Yeah. But maybe 51-48 in my side. 51-49, not 48.
Engin Terzi: we will ask that but not now sorry my friend very soon we will be asking once i'm finishing this i don't want to disrespect anyone whom hunsaker for his age he is amazing i don't know who you are talking
Engin Terzi: about my friends and i think we are okay levan is the beast very strong boom shaker i hope dennis versus levan happen super for our messing world that to happen dennis needs to be devil
Engin Terzi: um if not then probably we will see devon versus leon rematch but of course they are gonna uh decide this okay let's start from the event um let's go with the stara beckman versus edlin evgeny
Evgeny Prudnik: I think now I think Sarah Beckham because last time when I saw Egle she was weaker than usually. Yeah, but you mean the Gabriela match? Yeah, yeah. Against Gabriela? Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Gabriela was about 10 kilos heavier than Egle in that match. So it's normal because it is unlimited category. But yeah, so she was like 83. But I don't know because Egle has a longer level. It's not a very strong goal and very difficult.
Evgeny Prudnik: Did you say anything about this match, Herbert? I think I showed Sarah Backman very good shape.
Engin Terzi: I put 55 for Sarah. And you Levan? I think Sarah. Sarah is going to win? Yes. There is the sun and the same question again. Hey Levan, Prime you versus Prime Denis, who will win? Prime and Denis.
Engin Terzi: Mohamed Hassan, hello Engin. Can you please ask Hermes if he is interested in putting Alex Kordesha in a rematch in East versus West soon? Yeah, whenever you want. Yeah, okay. But... Where is Alex?
Engin Terzi: Alex right now is in Morocco, as a special guest, yeah. Only this evening I was chatting with him. He's planning on East vs West. Yes, yes, yes, he's planning, yeah, he's planning, yeah. Everything will be great, everything will be great. We are working hard and all will be great. Diliye MC, Engin, I love you. Okay.
Engin Terzi: You are very beautiful, huh? You are very beautiful. I am beautiful? Yes, you are. I am a man. I can be handsome, but I'm not beautiful. And this one has a female thing on it. So you are saying that a guy is telling me that he loves me. Okay. I told you that he's not a guy.
Engin Terzi: okay anyway so uh let's go let's go another match let's go another match uh no no no political answer just real answer just straightforward uh engin terzi versus david samusha come on he's gonna he's gonna destroy me this is how you believe
Levan Saginashvili: How strong are you now? How strong I am? I'm so strong that I tear the rope and hit my head to the floor. And floor broke. I say 50-50, you know. Levan, are you trying to be nice to me because you respect me? No, no, I respect you, but now I only like...
Engin Terzi: i know you are strong but uh no no he is stronger he's i mean he's killing everyone how can i i may do some damage to his wrist but i don't know if i can do the three rounds even you take his wrist you need to pin him you know so he is very powerful yeah very stronger yeah and do you know what the thing is i respect him so much
Engin Terzi: I respect him very much as an athlete, but as a person, I even respect him more. He's like a very respectful person. Yeah, so for me, very hard match. You understand? Like, if he was just like a dickhead, you understand? I would be like, ah, you know. But now, I will be, but not really. Nothing personal. Impossible. Yeah. Yeah. And how do you see Hermes?
Hermes Gasparini: It's very close, 50-50. I think you can take his wrist. But the problem is to have enough power, sorry, enough energy to go down, open his arms. I think only this is the problem. And you predict
Evgeny Prudnik: I think you win 100%. Come on. Samushia is strong, but you will control his wrist and the pronation. He will undo nothing. We will see.
Evgeny Prudnik: And now I see you have a good shape, I see. I saw it in your first second. That is a very interesting fight. Yeah, to be sure. Very, very interesting fight, you know, because my pronator is very good and his hook inability is very high. Yeah, I see.
Engin Terzi: If you compare your pronator and your cap in Ruiz, you are wrong. Only things is about power, arms and endurance. Yeah, yeah, you're right. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. Trip War. There was a video. Prudnik was trying to explain Hermes how he lost to Devon in set-up just after the day of the event. Why didn't Hermes listen to Evgeny that day?
Hermes Gasparini: I did a mistake. It was better to fight with him in the setup, not to lose like this. I don't push it too much in the setup because I don't want to pump it too much in my hand. And with him you can't fight.
Engin Terzi: How did you start armwrestling? I started, I go in gym.
Levan Saginashvili: or only myself, you know, climbing, fitness. And my coach found me, Lado Hutzishvili, and he say, I can be world champion in arm wrestling. And I say, whoa.
Levan Saginashvili: it is it is sports i asked him yes yes it is sport i'm listening and i started i listen him and i starting and he say uh after five years when i cut in training after five years uh uh i've been world champion and after five years i'll be your champion you your first time became world champion and when in india
Engin Terzi: Malaysia? No, no, no, it is in... Lithuania? Lithuania, Lithuanian, yes. Lithuania, 2014, yeah. Yes. I think you want the juniors there, Hermes? Yeah, I want junior. Yeah, okay.
Evgeny Prudnik: And my trainer said to me the first time he saw me, he said to me, oh, you can be the champion of the city.
Engin Terzi: You can be champion of what? Of city. Of city? Oh, okay. But this is normal, you know, just when you look at Lewan, it is normal, you know, you think that he will become champion and it's normal that you become only city champion. And that day when my coach say that, I'm back home and I say my parents, my brother, oh, I'll be world champion and they,
Engin Terzi: No, but whenever you look at your build, you know, it is possible to see that. But I was losing against my sister, even when I was 16 years old. So then whenever I say I'm going to become world champion, they laugh at me. You know, nobody believed because everybody was beating me and they were taking my hand like this. I was so weak.
Engin Terzi: So for you it's normal, for you it's normal. I've been very, very, very skinny. At that time I was very skinny, but my hands... Your bones, bones, your structure is, you know, big. So to build muscle is different thing, but your, your structure, your hand, your bone, everything is just, you are huge. It is easy to see that you can become like very big guy, you know, super heavyweight, yeah. SG Records, Roman.
Engin Terzi: Thank you. I don't love you. You know, this Mohammed Hassan is the number one hater of them. This guy is not this one. That was the other one. There was one guy. What was his name? He was just all the time. It's funny to listen about love industry.
Evgeny Prudnik: Yeah, anyways, Engin, can you please ask Prudnik if he thinks he can beat Ivan Matyushenko in a hook? Me? Yeah. I think I need to be very good to prepare for this. I have a question for you. I have a question for you. Yes.
Engin Terzi: Not for sure. Just we have one month. How is your left arm shape? One month? One month East vs West 10. How is your left arm right now? Is it in good shape? No, right? Because after the Daddy Cam match you said you have some problems. Yeah. Like would you pull Monteshenko next month? No, right?
Engin Terzi: no no this is what i was thinking because you just had big war big war you know with uh yeah um do you know what's what's the interesting thing do you guys think that even matushenko would be very dangerous for hunger yeah yes yes
Engin Terzi: Yeah, because not many people can hook on Garber, but Ivan Matyushenko's hook is just, you know, like incredible. I think it's the best for this. It's the best in the world. Yeah. I think under 115 kg, I think only Devon has a chance to topple Ivan. And it still may not be easy. Still may not be easy. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: spare me is i love this panel but i i love devon the most yeah why not we all have some uh okay let's let's go to another match zaor versus george swedco oh i love this match you love this match yes big boys big boys like you
Levan Saginashvili: Okay, who started? Okay, I started. I think Tretko take his wrist, Zaur's wrist. What's that? Tretko will take Zaur's wrist? Yeah. Like right from the beginning or later rounds? That I don't know, but I think...
Levan Saginashvili: I think 65% for Tretko and 35% for Zaur. 65% for Tretko and 35% for Zaur. Can I ask you a question? Before Zaur's bicep injury, your prediction would be the same?
Levan Saginashvili: No. Then you would think the Zaur would win? Actually no, but 50-50, I think it would be 50-50, but after... After the... I know he has a problem with the wrist too. Yeah, yeah. And Georgi's... Georgi's top roll is very good, it's very strong.
Engin Terzi: Do you think that Georgi, Georgi has potential if he really wants to continue professional? Does he have any potential to be a threat, like some kind of danger for you or not at all? I think yes. We pull in...
Engin Terzi: World Championship, European Championship many times and he's very strong. I think he can. I remember in 2018, I think he took second to you. I think you had a big fight against Rewaz and he had a big fight against Arif in the same event. And then you won the first place and then he took second place to you. And how do you see this much, Ermes?
Hermes Gasparini: I think a little bit favorite, a little bit after the injury, a little bit favorite, Georgi. But I don't know now the shape of Zaur. What is it? How is it?
Engin Terzi: I think a little bit with Georgi. Hermes, I heard that Devon and Georgi train after the award with right arm. Organize the fight, I will put him in good place. Devon told you that he is stronger than you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Next year I will keep him. Against Georgi? Yeah, yeah.
Hermes Gasparini: Okay, okay. Oh, it is good match. Good match, yeah. Very good match, yeah. Yeah. Also, whenever I... He lost with Cadoret. And he take a big gift to Morozov. Because if Morozov was in good shape, he don't want, for sure. You think? For sure, 100%. Hmm.
Engin Terzi: But do you realize that if he ever met you with the Jerry again, he will lose again for sure. Yeah. Okay. I understand. And, and did you, did you read the Jerry's comments that, you know, he lost against you because he was ill? No, he was ill. It's very, for sure he was ill.
Engin Terzi: Do you think that if he wasn't ill, the result would be different? Mask another fight with him next year. Would you pull? Jerry, again, make another fight, yeah. Yeah, okay. We can't wait when he's good head without problem. Listen, listen, if he says that, let me pull him in January, East versus West, January 20th,
Hermes Gasparini: will you pull him jerry daddy tomorrow tomorrow morning okay yes what him
Engin Terzi: Okay, it's good. I love this. I love that everyone is confident. I love that. I hate when people lose one match. With me, he doesn't have any chance. Zero. Because I know what I need to do. Zero. Okay, you know what? Zero chance. After what he said on social media about his loss against you, now you challenge him.
Engin Terzi: So now it is his time, it is his turn to accept the challenge. But he also wants to play against Devon. I don't know, we will see. Anyway, so, and you put me. Tomorrow. Tomorrow at 7 o'clock. Tomorrow at 7 o'clock, who are you going to pull? Who do you want to pull? Here, here.
Evgeny Prudnik: Against who? Who is the opponent? Anything. Anybody. Anybody. 7 o'clock tomorrow. Oh, tomorrow. Yeah, okay. 7 o'clock. Anybody. I will wait. And Prudny, can you beat Levan in hook? He's very strong. In hook, he's very strong.
Evgeny Prudnik: yeah yeah yes yes but but they won't beat him inside but after he gets tired probably after first starts my uh big trouble is my wrist and fingers and now I work good work yeah
Evgeny Prudnik: Okay, who is winning? Zaur winning or Georgi winning? You change the subject. Evgeny. Repeat, please. Georgi or Zaur, who win? Zaur or Georgi? Zaur, Georgi win. And Zaur need to prepare a technique without wrist. Oh, so you're thinking that Georgi is going to take his wrist? Yeah, yeah.
Evgeny Prudnik: Georgi can open him and reach, but he can't feel him because Georgi don't have a power in this moment. He has power in this, and this moment he doesn't have power. And Pavel Zolaev can use it and keep him, hold him. I don't think that Zaur is in this moment. I don't think so.
Engin Terzi: Not everybody can beat Georgi. Even Jerry had a very big problem with him. Okay, so Kamil Jablonski versus Ivan Matyushenko. Matyushenko. Matyushenko will win? Matyushenko will win 110%. And you, Levan? Me too. Maybe you.
Levan Saginashvili: maybe you uh for matushenko i think it is very big different in the level yeah yeah yeah and and how do you see the one he's he's winning against dave chaffee i don't know or because everyone beats dave chaffee i don't know what what happened with dave but everyone
Hermes Gasparini: You are laughing, but not because of disrespect to Dave, right? No, no, no, no. OK, because, yeah. No, because now Dave needs to rest a little bit. Because he has an injury. I have big respect for Dave. Super respect. He's a super guy. I think...
Levan Saginashvili: I think he needs to rest and to recover his neck. I think when you're not ready, you know it is. I see Dave not ready and he pulls against him.
Levan Saginashvili: I think he needs good rest, preparation and after that, because... He gave a hard match to Danish in the past. Yes. When he was healthy, super strong. This Jablonski is very, very good man, very good guy, but, you know, level is not close. So you are saying that Mask Matyushenko is going to win. And you think the same, Hermes? 100%.
Engin Terzi: it will be sensation the style is very big problem for the jamil triple is asking a provocative question very provocative question he is asking you that one can you beat elmas and devon in the same event one after another just say yes
Levan Saginashvili: For this, I take bonus. What? For this match, I take bonus. Oh, if you take bonus, you can beat them? Extra money. Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. We can organize. We can organize. Bonus me too. If we win. Hermes, Hermes. What? You want to pull too? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: you want to join them listen listen and i listen like that is that is normal money if you beat devon and then 10 000 more if you also beat hermes and then oh
Engin Terzi: it never happened in the rest of the history no i would never organize touching this is disrespect if you accept such match i would i would lose my respect for you what if you would ever know only for joe it will be good uh funny only to joking like no no no no did you have you ever seen a really really like like muhammad ali is fighting joe kreiser and then fighting
Engin Terzi: after that Georgi Foreman and then all or Mike Tyson two guys anyone who has respect for themselves they wouldn't lose this is like a like more like not known but maybe the training we can we can yeah training is okay yeah it's training but in the real mesh if you are planning to be no no no yes only with myself no we cannot okay Mohammed asked another provocative question
Engin Terzi: I hate Devon because he cheats everybody in the setups. Will Hermes be able to choose a referee next time he pulls Devon? Does Devon cheat Hermes? Mohamed Alsan says he's cheating. With everybody? Yes, because he's smarter than me. He's super strong. I don't want to make an excuse.
Hermes Gasparini: But for sure, if he has a little bit to take, he can take a little bit to have the victory.
Hermes Gasparini: You need to fight with him the setup. Devon't be scary about your pump hand like this. Be very strong and ready to go. Yeah, but you need to fight the setup.
Hermes Gasparini: Only when it is straight and then referee close the hand. No, no, at the beginning, at the beginning. Yeah, but if you fight five minutes... Because if you don't fight, he can take your wrist, you take everything. You need to go very strong in the setup to start... But you need to do very good training for that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And Alireza... Like when he did 11.
Hermes Gasparini: Levan, he take major three strong and he won. Levan won because his wrist is the strongest in the world. Yeah, but he was very strong in the setup when the match will be here to start. Engin, hand the host keys over to Hermes and go get yourself checked out sitting there.
Engin Terzi: will a minor conclusion ahead of East-West X is not a good idea. I think he's talking about that I hit my head. I will be asking my son to ask him question every one hour, you know, just if my head is okay, you know. Okay, so let's go to another match. Rustam Babaiev, Irakli Zirakashvili, 95 kilo. I think this is also a very interesting match.
Hermes Gasparini: Who is starting first? Rustam is like Matyushenko. His ability to hook is very impressive. He's one of my favorite pullers. Super legend. I think he is the best in the world in
Engin Terzi: in the history, his attack. Yeah. But he is shorter. For me, someone like Ivan is more dangerous because tall and then very quick, you know. Rustam is strong. You know, he's just dominating, you know, with the side pressure, with the here, bottom of the hand. Yeah. And then, yeah. Yeah. Ivan also strong, but he's also very fast and very tall forearm.
Engin Terzi: He is coming to your side. It is very, very hard to get away from him. So who is winning? Irakli is winning or Rustam is winning? I think if Rustam is in good shape, he will win. 70%. Oh, okay. Because Irakli lost matches, but only with top role. Whenever he pulled against the whistlers,
Engin Terzi: very hard to hook him, you know. He is here very, very strong. How do you... I remember his wrist is crazy. And you, Levan, I know it is your friend. And how do you see this match? I don't know. Rustam is legend. He is very strong.
Levan Saginashvili: Now Irakli is in good shape. He lost some little bit weight and he's feeling better. He's not losing his power. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I don't know. It is very, very good match. It is very interesting. Every time Irakli comes here, he's like 99 kilo, 100 kilo. He's like never 105 kilo. On the scale, I didn't see him. And now 95 kilo for him is, I think, very easy. His weight is 995.
Levan Saginashvili: right now 95 yeah i know um he uh his weight his uh category is 95 you know yeah 95 yes yes yes he is only pushing himself to be heavyweight he is not yeah i don't know who who is very dangerous but his legend is very strong and
Levan Saginashvili: for iraqis very very good match with the legend you know this for his career it is it is very good much important much yeah and and you evgeny first round uh will be a slap
Evgeny Prudnik: and Rustam go to the strap and the strap he will be very strong very quickly and one second he will be in Iraq and next next next round also each round
Evgeny Prudnik: um i think uh 80 percent uh on site to rustam but if the repression has a support
Evgeny Prudnik: If he can stop on one per second Rustam, I think he has more chance for win and it will be 50-50, maybe 60-40 on the side 0-30. And Ermes, your countryman, Frank Lamparelli vs Matt Mask?
Hermes Gasparini: I think I saw Matt Mask in the last fight, growing up his level. To you, he looked a little bit bigger than usual? Yeah, bigger. I think only for the experience, for the stage, the motion.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. His favorite, Matt Mask. Because Frank is more used to for the tournaments, events, but this is different profession. It's very difficult to change. Yeah. Do you find their style a little bit similar or no? Between... I think Matt Mask is more like high knuckle and then
Hermes Gasparini: like lamparelli is how is it how can you explain because you are nice to both of them and you know them very good yeah with the lamparelli it's like six five years six years ago yeah yeah but how do you see the difference the style yeah it's very difficult but this this time
Hermes Gasparini: I think it's a little bit similar. Yeah, okay. It's a little bit shame. Yeah, I think it's the shame, more or less. Okay. It depends on who has a stronger wrist. Only you know about this. And who do you think has a stronger wrist? I don't know.
Hermes Gasparini: Because both of the athletes, when I won, I won with my arm power, not like I cracked his wrist. Only with my arm. And how do you see this, Leman? Oh, I many times not see Frank. He's a very good man. I know him.
Engin Terzi: I don't know, he training? Yeah, yeah. He come in European last year at the WAF. He pulled the Masters at WAF. He won. And then in the Seniors, he gave travel to Georgi Swetko. The match was like minimum, minimum 20 seconds. Okay. I think Frank winning.
Evgeny Prudnik: And you? I'm for Frank. You're for Frank? Yes. And you, Evgeny? It will be very interesting, very close match. Very interesting to see. I am...
Evgeny Prudnik: I saw Lamparelli and looking for him all the time. Very interesting technique. He is not comfortable for anybody. I think Lamparelli has more chance.
Engin Terzi: but it's very very close match it's very interesting to see by the way guys tomorrow tomorrow at 12 p.m eastern time um dennis siplenko and devon larat will be my guests tomorrow
Engin Terzi: This is very beautiful life. 12 o'clock? Your time, 8 o'clock evening, 20. Istanbul time, 7. Italy time and Belgium time is 6. And the time with Jupiter, it is 245.
Engin Terzi: Just joking, you know. India. India. Jeremy Coleman. Ernest, your favorite drink is quali tea. This is your favorite drink. Yeah, quali, quali tea. Jeremy Coleman said that.
Engin Terzi: And then let's see if I'm missing another one. And then we go to the next match. Guys, do you guys know Rosa? Rosa from Costa Rica. She took second to Barbara at the WAF last year in the Super Heavyweight. Not this year, but last year. P.R. Isaac was going to pull against Irina Glatkaya. And then Irina, doctor told her not to train for some time, you know.
Engin Terzi: And then she said, it was my dream to compete at the East versus West. But I hope you will invite me again. I said, yes, of course I will invite you. You are a legend. But FIA is going to pull 2022 WAF World's second place in the super heavyweight category, Rosa. But do you guys know Rosa? No? No. Okay. So it is hard to...
Engin Terzi: Michael Workspace, Engin, regardless who will win, Denis and Devon, please have cameras ready to point at Levan during the match, during the post-match interview. We want to see the call-out. Oh. They want us to show you, to turn the camera to you when the winner is faulting Levan. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Caroline, thank you, Caroline.
Engin Terzi: Hi, Engin, and all of you. Do you think Derek Smith can beat Dave Sheffy? Right now, if they pull, I think he has a good chance, but like a best of Dave Sheffy will be very hard. Two questions. Was Hermes defeated by Devon because of the fact that Devon totally controlled Hermes mentally? This is the first question. Is it you lost only because of mentally or he was also strong?
Hermes Gasparini: it was a little bit mentally because too much days with him to to speak like this i was not like angry like you know too much if you pull him next time then you will be
Hermes Gasparini: not get closer i don't i don't want you to see him before the fight do you remember when you came here to yellow to pull mad mess
Engin Terzi: I changed it a little bit. Yeah, yeah. We have a reservation room for you. And then you decided to stay far away in another hotel because you didn't want to see the Mad Max. You only saw him on the competition day. Yeah, I remember. I don't want to see him, you know? Yeah, yeah. So the same reason, yeah. Okay.
Engin Terzi: And the other question, will Levan face Denis soon? My friend, Levan will face Denis only if Denis beats Devon. Am I correct, Levan? Yeah. And Caroline, again, my question was for Levan. Oh, okay. They are asking. She's asking, Levan, Derek Smith, can he beat Davit Sheffy? Derek Smith?
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah. I don't know. It is a very bad question because we are this Dave Chaffee and where is Davit Smith, you know. You mean different level? Yes, of course. But how about in the shape right now, the Davit? Now it's possible in such shape?
Levan Saginashvili: Now, I think yes, because they were lost with Jablonski. I don't know. I think he not need to pull now. He needs now rest and training. Because his level is go down and down. Now people ask Derek Smith or Dave Chaffee. No, it's...
Levan Saginashvili: Four, five years ago, nobody asked who would win, you know. I want to see Dave Chaffee like ten years ago and five years ago. I want to be back.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. And Malakis TV. Hello, everyone. Just wanted to let you all know that Denis is going to destroy Devon. Soon we're going to talk about it. Boom. Hanseker. This gets new corners interested in competing. Newcomers interested in competing. This is great. And Trip World, this is one of the best podcasts ever. Thank you all. Thank you, my friend, for the support. Okay. Let's go to the other matches. And okay.
Evgeny Prudnik: Artem Taino versus Sasho. Let's go. Who's winning? Sasho. Sasho. And you, Evgeny? I think Taino can win Sasho. But not sure to the end. Or just...
Evgeny Prudnik: Maybe he will win, it won't be 0-3, it will be 3-2. Either way? Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: So you are saying that Sasho and Taino, they both can win and the score will be very close? Yeah, yeah. Okay, I understand, yeah. And then let's go to the Ongarbaev versus Patasins. Oh my God. What do you say, Levan? I think Ongarbaev. Yes, I think Ongarbaev too.
Engin Terzi: And you, Evgeny? Maybe Hutchings. I mean, I believe that to beat Hutchings, you need to control his pronator with your wrist. Because if the guy even loses, if he has a pronator, he has incredible side pressure. So you beat him, Evgeny, because you control everything with your wrist. But Ongarbaev is not like really super dominant wrist. He is more like, you know,
Engin Terzi: So I think that Patashins will have his pronator. And when he has the pronator, his side pressure is intense. So I see where I believe the match will go for Patashins winning side. But Ongarbaev will stop. I don't know if he can bring it or not bring it. And Levan, you think that it's going to be like easy match for Ongarbaev? No, no.
Levan Saginashvili: Not really much, it is, it will be a really hard match, both of them. 55 to Ongarbaev. 55 a little bit more. I think 51 and a half for Ongarbaev. So you are saying that this is actually close, huh? 51-48. Yeah. 51-40 what?
Engin Terzi: Okay. What was your math, you know, when you go to school? Oh, again, you give me the 1%? I think he's joking with us. How about the last two matches, Sasho versus John Brzee? I think John. Very hard match, but I think John.
Engin Terzi: i think i think i think that uh evgeny prudnik have very very much experience with sasho and i think he will give us the best best uh answer oh but i don't have experience with john i know but you like listen i'm 100 sure that the most guys that you ever watched in your life was john brisbane
Evgeny Prudnik: about this match Sasho has a chance to win because he has a good endurance and
Evgeny Prudnik: When I pull with him, he has very good control of the down formation. He has very good control of the side pressure. Maybe it will be like Sasho Poglini.
Evgeny Prudnik: maybe sasho uh two round two round he he lost yeah and then after cables i don't know i hope that john will win but it's a show very dangerous yeah
Engin Terzi: People, people underestimate Sasho. And, and, and how do you see Levan? I think Sasho will win. You think Sasho will win? I have a question. In this trap, how possible do you think that John to take Sasho's wrist in the trap? No, no. Sasho has a very strong wrist, very strong biceps. His ...
Engin Terzi: He is younger, he is stronger. I think Sasho is winning. Okay, so Hermes is thinking John is going to win. And Prudnik is thinking that Sasho has a little bit more chance. And then Levan thinks that Sasho is going to win. And then let's go to the main event. Denis Siplenko and Devon Larratt. Larratt will win. Larratt will win?
Evgeny Prudnik: Easy or hard? Hard, but he will win. Tell us how the match will go. Ready, go, then what's happening? First, it's going to be a strap, 100%. Slap and strap.
Evgeny Prudnik: Larratt will control the wrist of Tsiplenkov, but Tsiplenkov will control the side pressure, and when he will tire it, Larratt will take the center, but Tsiplenkov will turn
Evgeny Prudnik: after in this situation we will see a fight round or something like that but you say Devon is gonna win and how do you see this match Hermes because Devon more endurance yeah you say Devon has more endurance but trust me Denis also is very good in the rules I think
Hermes Gasparini: Devon, for sure, he will take his risk because the hand, the setup of Danish low hand is not very good for Devon. But for the arm power, I think Danish have more power and he can use the king move.
Engin Terzi: Do you think that it is possible for Denis to take Devon's risks? You know, Denis is not only the impronation. Do you realize that he is also doing a lot of growth? He is also pulling with his legs a lot, you know? If I need to put the money, I put the money on Devon.
Hermes Gasparini: But it's a very close fight, very close. Do you think that Danny is holding so low? Is this an advantage for Devon to do a high hook? If he will have a match, me and Danny, for me, it's a super if he takes it down.
Engin Terzi: If someone takes it down on me, my hand is more high than him. But in the past, Denis was holding and was going wrist and side pressure. Now he's going here and then if you see his matches and then coming back, even Danikian is putting him sometimes in bad positions.
Hermes Gasparini: And you want to say? Yeah, the King move. I think he has the possibility to hold the game in the lowest position. And do you think from here he can bring the match? Yeah, if maybe Larratt will be pumped too much very early, he has a chance to win for sure. Because he has such pressure, he can push like this.
Levan Saginashvili: And Levan? If I talk pragmatic, then it's really bad. I hope, I hope, Tevan can win. You are saying that your mind is saying that Denis is gonna win?
Levan Saginashvili: And your heart wants Devon to win. Yes, 100%. Why? Because they are closer friends, probably. Yes, and I think if Denis has more power. No, no, no. He's asking why you want Devon to win.
Levan Saginashvili: Because he... Why I want to... Because Devon is a good person. But Levan, most likely you're going to pull the winner of this match. Do you want to pull Devon again or you want to pull Denis?
Levan Saginashvili: Look, look, for this I want... Danish. Danish win. Yeah, it's what I was thinking. My heart, my heart for Dewar. Okay, okay. My mind, my head, I think Danish will win, because he has more power. And ...
Levan Saginashvili: But I believe in my heart for... Who? Who will referee this fight? No referee. You? No. Thank you. Too much for free. No referee.
Engin Terzi: No referee? No referee. Did they just start? Okay. Okay. If you super chat, then we finish. Levan needs his competitors to use two hands. He's saying that people need to arm wrestle you with two hands. Not one hand is not enough, they are saying. And Ali Rıza, how do we get Voivoda back into the game more? Do you think he's going to keep working with Denis
Hermes Gasparini: and keep coming back. Do you guys think that Walwoda will come back? I don't think. He'll come back two times and lose. I think he was overrated, like this, this is good. Huh?
Hermes Gasparini: Overrated is when you push yourself too high. Overrated means more than what you actually are. I think in the past it was a little bit...
Engin Terzi: Overrated, you think? Yeah, because he won with John, but when he won with John... He didn't only win with John, he beat everyone at that time, all the best. Matt Goerner was very good, Travis was very good. But I think that Vojvoda at that time and Vojvoda today are different preparation. I don't think there is a big difference. No, no, there is a huge difference. There is at least two...
Levan Saginashvili: 10-12 kilo difference even on the weight. That day in Zloty... 2004. John lost one match to other guys, yes? No, John lost Vojvoda first.
Engin Terzi: And then Iwaki. But in the Pulling John documentary, they twist it. They twist it like John lost the first... John, he told me he was injured. No, no, I know, I know, I know. But this is not about John. There was other guys too at that time. He beat Travis, he beat Matt Gurner, he beat at that time the Samarancho, Samir Pushkar. Of course, Pushkar was very young then. Yeah, very young.
Engin Terzi: I mean, he was good. He was very good, yeah. But I mean, just also remember, if he would continue, he was in the sport only for four years. Engin, I have a question. Yeah, okay. Devon and Denis match, it is four, five rounds? Yeah, four, five rounds. We decided. Like, I don't want anyone to... Whenever you stop pulling, people get angry with you, but they didn't get angry
Levan Saginashvili: because it is a very good match and uh three five rounds yeah it is so very yeah yeah yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: There is nothing. How do four beasts fit in one screen? Can you all give top five? There are three beasts and me. I'm not a beast, but because I'm small, 90 kilo only. What's your top five? They are asking. Before we close. Yeah. And this is, please don't ask more questions. And let's finish here. Who are top five?
Engin Terzi: Doctor Five? Yeah. Can I ask you something, Levan? Gennady being in Devon, and then Devon being in Hermes, and where is Gennady? Oh my God. I don't know. Because everyone... It's because of the styles as well, different styles.
Levan Saginashvili: I think we need the rematch. No, no, it will happen, it will happen, yeah. You mean between Gennady and Devon? Gennady and Devon, yes. Gennady and Devon too, and I think Hermes and Gennady too. Yeah, yeah, of course, of course, yeah. It's very normal, they should compete, yeah. But now with situation is stay top five, it is very hard.
Levan Saginashvili: But more event is happening, more clear it is getting. In the past, everyone was guessing. Now you can see this guy is beating that guy. Because Gennady beat Devon. Devon beat Hermes. Hermes beat Jerry. Jerry beat Gennady. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Levan Saginashvili: That's very interesting. Jerry beat Gennady and Hermes beat Jerry. My friend lost because hanging the day when they paid me. Thank you much.
Hermes Gasparini: someone paid me to lose this is the question yeah these these people are really hard with people seriously like this every day every day what's that for loose no every day i i i has a message like this when i lost
Engin Terzi: Even if they give you a hundred thousand, you wouldn't do such thing. You know that. These people are idiots. They have no respect for themselves. They just cannot accept what they don't understand about the arm wrestling. Sorry, but they just think that, oh, look at the bicep. It is five something bigger. Oh, the guy is going to win, you know.
Engin Terzi: If the guy is lifting more kilos, how can he beat him? Because he's lifting this many kilos. Luka Vojvoda with John. Vojvoda, for the fight, he was super strong. Or maybe this... They're idiot people. Just no need to even talk about it. But I heard something about you, about your next match. Maybe I have a match with Lalletti.
Engin Terzi: Oh, the one? Bravo, bravo. Very good fight. Very good. Very good. Very good. Yeah. It's a little bit risky fight for both of you, but these matches need to happen. If you think that you are the best in the world, you want to be the best, you need to beat these guys.
Hermes Gasparini: Yeah, because now I have time to prepare my wrist and everything. And I want to show if I have time to prepare this part, I can do a good fight with a long leverage. And how do you see this match, Lewand? That's very important. How about you think?
Levan Saginashvili: ... I think ... Hermes need to tighten his wrist and fingers, don't too much, because Lalit's head, hand is too much longer, and it is... Yes.
Levan Saginashvili: But I think if Hermes loses his wrist, he can take, he can stop. Shoulder pressure. Yes, I think he can stop. Yeah, but I don't think it's Hermes' main plan. I think main plan is to take the wrist here. And you, Evgeny, how you see this match?
Evgeny Prudnik: I think Hermes is very easy to open Gabriels Laletin and will win him. But why are you letting him? Very easy? Yeah. Not very easy, but easy.
Engin Terzi: I think it is the biggest mistake against Lalletti, the side pressure. You go side pressure and evil. I think the round one when Lewand tried to go this way and then Lewand's wrist and then Lewand went and then rise up and then beat him. I think the best way is to have good riser and then really because he is most like this. Lewand, how many kilos you can lift with the rise like this?
Levan Saginashvili: This? Yeah. I'm not riding this. No? No, I'm riding with the dumbbell. And I put dumbbell. And when you take dumbbell, it is push you here. But I think a little bit, but your hand is very big.
