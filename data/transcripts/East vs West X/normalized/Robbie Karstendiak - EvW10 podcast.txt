SPEAKER_00: it did how are you doing how are you feeling uh i feel like that the concussion is okay but i had some serious damage here around this area back here you know i hit so uh tough and i i'm not gonna compete it's gonna really uh be
SPEAKER_00: Like the truth is for some time I haven't been competing and the guy that I'm going to compete against is just absolute best, you know? Yeah. Five world title matches and he won all five of them. Wow. So I was going to pull him in two months training still for someone who has been inactive. It is risky. And now after this, you know, like I also lost, uh,
SPEAKER_00: Confidence, I don't even know it's gonna be okay till that time but I cannot make him wait if I'm gonna be a replacement I had to do it as soon as possible for sure. Yeah Your health is the most important, you know, your health is yeah. Yeah. Yeah back into training slowly and then you know back stronger and
SPEAKER_00: You know, once you lock yourself into the target, it is very, very hard to say, you know, okay, I'm not doing it. Like you want to do it. You want to do it. I feel good. The arm, everything's strong, but the here, the connection is, there is a problem, you know, and I, and you, we haven't met before, but I have had long, long conversations with your father. And he told me about your, what exactly power lifters should I say?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so I have a powerlifting background. I've done that since I was 10 years old. Actually, so when I was 10 years old, I went to the Junior Olympics, which is probably the highest elite for kids. And I actually ended up winning that at 10 years old. And, you know, not knowing I was good, I won. And I was like, Oh, maybe I need to keep this up. So
SPEAKER_01: I've always had a fitness and strong background. I've always, you know, my dad always instilled that into me. He's always taught me how to live properly with good. And, you know, I just kept with it in all these years. And then kind of, I slowly transitioned over to arm wrestling later on. Um, you know, which is great. I still do both. I still do powerlifting. I still compete in powerlifting, but arm wrestling, it's the one-on-one, uh,
SPEAKER_00: contact you know i just i just love the combat exactly exactly so it's not fighting it's arm wrestling though it's you know it's great i love it it's just different you know like in both have its own difficulties one is you are competing against the gravity while the other one you are competing against another human being you know like yeah which one do you find
SPEAKER_01: harder mentally mentally maybe they are messing uh so it's pretty similar in programming and stuff and i i try to stick with everything with powerlifting programming like background but the physical aspect yeah i would say arm wrestling there's so many verticals in different ways uh you know with the hand and wrist there's so many different options it's almost like a chess game and someone looking from the outside you see it as just arm wrestling
SPEAKER_01: But once you're actually in the sport, it's really almost like a mental and physical battle at the same time, which that's what I love, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. To compete against another human being who is trying to beat you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's only one winner, you know. There's only one winner. It's you or the other person. Yep, yep. And how long ago you started arm muscles?
SPEAKER_01: Started arm wrestling about six, seven years ago. I really took a little bit of time off and really competitively for the past three years. I have a group of guys over here in Louisiana that I train with every other week. So it's a good group of guys. And then Craig Coulier, the guy that just killed everyone at that round robin, he's only three hours from me. So he's great. He's an inspiration. I always looked up to Craig.
SPEAKER_00: Great guy. Great guy. He's a beast. Jeremy Coleman, one of the best fans in arm wrestling, he says, Hello, Robbie. I lived in Ruston for 43 years. Wow. Is it the same town as yours?
SPEAKER_00: Rustin is about 20 minutes from me. That's very close. Very close. Okay. The reason I ask you when you started arm wrestling, it was because you said like six, seven years ago, you started arm wrestling while your father suddenly became the hero of the community. How do you, how do you, how do you find this? Like with the white SL and then he's like, I,
SPEAKER_00: I once had four hours phone call, you know, I never invited. Yeah. But he's like a great guy with like so much knowledge. He tells me about boxing. He tells me about everything, you know, and, and then now, you know, that in arm wrestling, like, like those injuries are big problems. Like when you are young, you know, you can somehow recover when you get older, those are more permanent chronic.
SPEAKER_00: And now, like most of the heroes of arm wrestling are the ones that pull like decades, but cannot really pull anymore so good because of the injuries, permanent injuries. And the stem cell is something that really like working miraculously, you know. And then your father has been very generous with this atlas, and now suddenly became like a hero.
SPEAKER_01: in the community. How do you find this? I think it's pretty amazing. I know one of the reasons why he never really wanted to target anyone specifically. The arm wrestling community, him targeting the arm wrestling kind of happened organically and mostly because of me that I was in the sport and he knew I was solely really involved in the sport and arm wrestling. So he felt like
SPEAKER_01: Maybe it would be good to help give back to the community in something I love so much. Dad's a very generous guy. He'll give to people and he never expects anything back. He'll give and give and give. It's not like he does it with a good intent for other people's sake to help them recover and their longevity in the sport as well. He's a real good guy. He's very proud of you. He's very proud of you.
SPEAKER_00: He very often talks about you. The most proud he is about is that he says that you are a very humble person. All the time he says that you never brag about yourself, that even though you have done
SPEAKER_01: successful things in the sports. Like, can you tell us about your, uh, like you said that you, you competed the junior Olympics and then like, like, for example, can you tell us your numbers? I won the junior Olympics. Um, I ended up setting at 17 years old. I said, uh, I set a world record for squat at the time. It was raw, you know, drug tests and everything. It was like 480 pounds at 180.
SPEAKER_01: 480 pound squat. I don't know how many in kg that is. It was that like, I was 185 pounds at 17 years old. And that was a world record. I set a world record strict curl at 17 years old. I said that as well. And that was like 150 pounds at 17 years old. There was just like a lot of other things. I hate bragging about myself because I don't want to sound too like cocky or stuff. But like when people ask me,
SPEAKER_01: it's kind of uncomfortable for me to talk about it, you know, but you know, so power, like I said, powerlifting has always been my go-to my, my first, my first love I've always done it. And, uh, I will continue to do it in arm wrestling, but I think, like I said, I'm going to focus more on arm wrestling. I want to get to that top level. I feel like I'm right there. I mean, you know, there's pros and there's a little bit better than pros and then there's the
SPEAKER_01: Right in the middle, I'm better than the average pro, but I'm not close to the elite level. And I think I can, within a couple of years, I think I'll be able to crack that. How old are you right now? 29 now. 29. And what is missing right now? More of coordination. I think power is there. This is what I was told about you.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think I need to get a little more knowledge in the sport, a little bit more experience in my hand and wrist. I don't have a manual labor job, so a lot of the people I go against have a little bit stronger hand and wrist. My biceps are really strong, and I have a really good strong core. But I feel like once I start working my hand and wrist in different angles, I'll be able to compete with the elites for sure.
SPEAKER_01: I'm calm. I just won Mississippi State a couple months ago. I just won a couple other tournaments. I won IFA Nationals at 86 kg. And I faced Craig Coulier in the overalls and that didn't go too well. But that's what I said. I'm like right there. Craig is very experienced, very experienced and also very explosive.
SPEAKER_00: Last week, his performance was incredible. Yeah, yeah. He's probably maybe a year older than me or something. He must be around 50. And I'm 49, so we are almost the same age. And I'm proud of him. I was very happy to see his performance. How long have you been in the sport? 30...
SPEAKER_01: Three years, 32, 33 years. Yeah. 33 years. I've been watching you for a while now and Devon, you know, we're good friends with Devon. Devon talks highly about you. You know, he said, you're like the wizard. You're, you're like one of the greatest arm wrestlers to ever live. So I'm glad that I'm going to be able to get to meet you and I'm going to be able to pick your brain. Yeah. You're coming in. Well, how do you feel? Artem you excited? I'm very excited. I'm more humbled that you invite me over.
SPEAKER_01: And it's going to be a great experience. I'm happy to get out of the country, go to Turkey and see the whole event. You know, what you've done with the sport of arm wrestling is amazing. You know, you grow the whole community over here and I'm getting more and more people to watch these events and they're loving it. It's like the whole production you put on is awesome. Yeah. I mean, I always say that this is something that we do all together, my friend, like even one single positive message.
SPEAKER_00: just motivates me like crazy you understand like like that is like because i love it because i have been part of this sport you know like almost i can say what 60 percent of my life more than that you know and more than that probably 70 percent of my life you know and uh again you know i do that and i'm i think successful but it is because the potential was there
SPEAKER_00: But nobody was bringing the things together. The same in arm wrestling. The most important thing is synergy. The coordination of the muscle groups. This is the same. You need to do the work, the fans and the athletes all together. When we come together,
SPEAKER_00: Then the things are incredible, you know, so that only thing that needed to be done was this. And then I have been doing by the support of the community. And now your father has been telling me about a powerful product. It is all natural, you know, like nutrition, you know, and can you tell us something about creatine and
SPEAKER_01: What was it exactly? So it's, we're going to be releasing it probably within a few cup in a couple months. I can't tell you exactly what it is because right now, um, we work on, uh, MP, um, certified and bachelor. So we're trying to get like, I have friends that are UFC fighters, top of, um, professional football players, baseball players, athletes, arm wrestlers.
SPEAKER_01: And we're all getting together and trying to create this great blend and seeing exactly what is, like, required in the blend for it to be the best. But once that releases, I think it's going to be a game changer for a lot of athletes for sure. You're going to be able to – everyone's going to be able to take it. It's going to be for, like, before recovery, before, after, during, everything. Excuse me. I'll start my phone. Let me just mute my phone.
SPEAKER_01: work stuff but yeah it's gonna be when are you gonna announce this probably within a month or two um if you go to my page it's gonna be bodybyrabi.com and you put in your email and uh you'll be the first to know one once the product actually releases okay yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm sorry. We're going to have like gummies, different gummies. We're going to have pills. We're going to have actual like powder they could take and water and mix it in formula. So it's not just going to be one product. It's going to be multiple products. This first product is what we really want to set the standard with. So that's what we're really going to target. Okay. I can't wait to try. You said the gummies. Gummies are the ones that you're talking about, right? It will be in the gummy version, yeah?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we'll have gummies later on. I don't know if this first release will be with gummies, but we're going to have gummies later on as well, like vitamins, fish oils. We're going to have everything. Oh, okay. That's good. I just can't wait. It's going to be an online virtual store, so you'll be able to order from anywhere in the world. It's not going to just be like a store you have to go inside of. You could go online. Yeah, yeah. Your voice gets cut a little bit sometimes.
SPEAKER_00: I think a phone call came to him. Can you hear me? Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Phone call came or what? Yeah, I'm getting phone calls all the time. I don't know how to. I don't want to put my phone in airplane mode and cut this off. I don't know if that's going to work. Yeah, yeah. Sorry. No, no, it's okay. It's okay. Yeah, I can't wait because your father talked about it.
SPEAKER_01: How effective it will be, and then, yeah, I want to try it as well, you know. Very effective. And once it comes out, you'll definitely be the first to know. Definitely be the first to know. And I would love your honest experience on it because it's something that's going to be affordable to everyone, all the arm wrestlers, even non-arm wrestlers. Everyone can use it, you know. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I have a question for you. You have been doing a very serious sport, the other one, powerlifting. Did you also have injuries? I did have injuries. I had a couple of knee injuries and an arm wrestle. And I actually had some arm and wrist, nothing serious, but definitely something that I had to take some time off. And dad actually helped me out. Okay. This is what I was going to ask.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah so i could i could personally vouch for for dad's company like an unbiased review it does work wonders um i got injured in what was it last year um or two years ago at louisiana state arm wrestling i hurt my inner elbow i never go in a flop flop so i lost my wrist and i kind of had a pole there like it's the final so i had to do whatever i had to do and i ended up
SPEAKER_01: I had to pop my inner elbow. I knew that for two weeks I could not move my arm at all, at all. It was hurting very bad. Dad hooked me up. He gave me some exosomes. I did a couple rounds of those. A week later, I was fine, back to working out. I pulled Nationals four weeks later, and I won there.
SPEAKER_00: Interesting thing, I also tried those exosomes and then like it's just arm resting, you know, you will still feel hurt. But the thing is that like it is coming back to healthy form quick, you know. Yeah. Yeah. This is my experience with it. Yeah. Did you know that Dr. Mask is also coming to Istanbul? I saw that. You just got the exosomes though or did you actually get the stem cell as well?
SPEAKER_00: No, I only get exosomes because it needs to be in the cold chain. It needs to be protected. Okay. Artem you going to come to the United States and get it? What's that? Artem you going to come to the United States and get it? No. Dr. Mask is coming to Istanbul with the stem cell. Oh, great. He will be treating me and Denis. Denis Cyplenkov. Wow. Yeah. Treat him after his Devon match. Oh, yeah. Before that...
SPEAKER_00: what i was told that levan told me um 40 days you shouldn't train you know if it is a really serious uh treatment you know yeah so i will take my time you know i'm 49 if i can pull five more years i will be very happy i i can rest for the 40 more days no problem you know because i i feel like very limited everywhere you know everywhere very limited yeah
SPEAKER_01: It will be great too. Yeah. Dr. Mask is coming. I'm very happy. Thanks to your father. Thanks to your father. And, and yeah, I'm glad it could help a lot of people, especially not just in the United States. It can travel and reach abroad for people that are actually need, you know, especially in the arm wrestling community. You know, everyone is so close together.
SPEAKER_01: You know, we all fight and compete against one another, but we all love each other, you know, and that's what I kind of, I love about the community in arm wrestling. Everyone's for someone else. You know, you get a lot of people that are just wanting to help other people, you know, whether it is spread knowledge, wisdom, or actually help in other areas of their life. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so I'm sure that you will enjoy, I'm sure that you will enjoy and
SPEAKER_00: I'm very excited. I want you to also present one of the title match belts. That would be great. It would be great, yeah. And there will be after pulls. Maybe you would try it yourself, you know. Yeah, yeah. I want to pull you before you get treated just to, you know, just to feel it, you know. I know I don't have anything for you, but I just want to maybe I can pick your brain and learn a little bit. No, no, for sure, for sure, for sure, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: especially the i mean we will be we will be all together you know all the time you know yeah good i'm excited i'm excited a couple more weeks then i'll head over there many of the north american heroes will be there like devon john tatashins matt mask sarah you know and all them yeah yeah yeah all of them are you know great great pullers you know and
SPEAKER_01: I'm excited for that main event. Obviously, I love all the U.S. arm wrestlers and I hope they all win in the United States. But I know I'm going to be freaking out for that Devon-Denis match. I know everyone's going to go crazy for that. I know it's just going to be a crazy match. If Denis' second match is returning, it's going to be awesome. What do you expect from this match?
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I'm biased, so of course I have to go with Devon 3-0. But I don't think it's going to be an easy 3-0. I think it might be a little tougher than people think, but I still think Devon 3-0. Okay. When you say it will be tougher than people think, what does people think? You think that people think Devon is going to dominate?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, I've been seeing a lot of different opinions. Some people were saying it's going to be easy for Denis, and some people were thinking Devon. I mean, I'm always commenting on Devon. If Devon gets in a position advantageous in helping him and bleeding Denis out where he gets tired, once Denis gets tired, I think it's all in Devon's favor. I don't know if the mind games are going to work as much because I don't know how much he can speak English.
SPEAKER_00: But I don't know. I think it's still Devon all the way. Yeah. Like, until a month ago, I was thinking, I didn't tell anyone at that time because I'm an organizer, that Devon was going to win. It's what I was thinking inside of me. But after I see the improvements by Denis' team, then I now think that it is a very close match, 50-50 match. This is what I believe.
SPEAKER_00: But we shouldn't underestimate Denis' endurance as well. Denis also has very good endurance. Somehow his body regenerates very quickly. The same is for Devon.
SPEAKER_00: We will see. We will see. A lot of things will be answered. Do you follow, like, have you seen any other East vs. West events, pay-per-view events? Yes, yes. I've watched pretty much all the events, yes. Oh, yeah? Okay. Then, like, for example, you know Ongarweb? Yes, yes. And Ongarweb is going to pull Tata Sings. I know that you're going to support the fellow American puller. But do you see also a close match, this one?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so I love Todd Hudgens, obviously. I love him. I've always loved his style. I actually got to meet him once, and I was like, wow, he's actually bigger than I thought he was, his forms. I would put Todd against everyone. I saw him pull Corey West and beat Corey West. But Ongarbaev is just a tactician. He's just like a wizard. I would give it to Ongarbaev, this one, even though I don't want him to win. I want Todd Hudgens.
SPEAKER_01: I feel like Ongarbaev is going to pull it off, though. Oh, you think he has the edge? I do. Yeah, I think Ongarbaev has the edge. I think what he did against Irakli was just insane to me, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Especially, you know. Yeah. Yeah, it was like. Probably a different type of puller, you know. Ongarbaev has been pulling against, I don't know,
SPEAKER_00: if any of those players had the side pressure of Tata Shinks. No. Yeah, those guys are also very Tejonis technical, Irakli is technical, you know, while Todd is just like pure, you know, horsepower. If Ongarbaev can handle and control that pressure. Yeah. Yeah, because if he is going outside and Todd is just constantly losing his, with a loose wrist and pressing and pressing and pressing,
SPEAKER_01: I think enough power. I think he can go like 3-2. I think he can be like 3-2. So you are expecting a war? Yeah, war for sure. Do you know John's opponent, Sasho? John and Sasho? Yeah. Sasho, did you see his match with Pauline?
SPEAKER_01: Sasho and Poland, yes. That was a war too, yeah. Yeah. Sasho was losing 2-0 and then he came back from there and won 3-2, yeah. I saw that one. That was a war. I met Paul for the first time at the Vita Sullivan. Great guy. Super strong. He was helping me in the setup. But if I was going to beat Sasho, it would probably be John. But like I said, that's going to be a great match as well. I think that could be like a 3-2 match too in John's favor.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very, very. And there is also Rustam Babaiev versus Irakli match. That is also very, very, very interesting match. Yeah. I don't know. From one side, you know, I got injured. I'm disappointed. I was preparing very well, but now I will just sit down and without any stress of the competing, you know, I will be. What you do for arm wrestling?
SPEAKER_00: That's what you have to do. Now all that stress of competing is out, you get to relax, you get to recover, you get to get stem cells, you get to be stronger than ever in a few months. We will have around 100 people on the stage. They will be watching. We will prepare the stage.
SPEAKER_00: for people to sit, be close to the atlas and watch. There will also be people on the auditorium as well. They will be sitting in normal places as well. Where are you planning to watch it? Up there or down there? Wherever you let me, I'll be more... No, I mean, it's not let you. Wherever you want to. If I could be on the stage, I mean, that would be... That's closer you would prefer.
SPEAKER_00: For sure. If you let me, that'd be great. Yeah, that is what I wanted to ask, yeah. You tell me to go run you to get you something to drink, I'll do that for you. This is your event. I appreciate what you're doing for me and allowing me to be here. No, I will be honored. You know, you are also sponsoring our event and your father is helping the whole community. Just like we appreciate, you know, we appreciate everything your family is doing for the community.
SPEAKER_01: I just hope that it will be a success and then everyone will get what they deserve and minimal, minimal mistakes during the event and then everything will be fine, you know? I think that we're still in the beginning stages of the stem cell with helping and the outreach of the stem cell community with my company. This is obviously in the beginning infrastructure stages.
SPEAKER_01: And also with the arm wrestling for you, you've been putting it on for, I don't know, a year, year and a half, two years with the East versus West. I think it's just going to keep growing and growing and growing and getting more fans throughout the whole world, you know, as all promote it, you know, for each other. I mean, this is a great production way to put on. Yeah. And we had that potential, you know, I think, I think still just like an iceberg, you know, what we see is just like, like nothing compared to.
SPEAKER_00: our potential this this is what i believe this is what i always believed and i was like like this is the like one of the best sports in the world one of the oldest sports in the history and now like like why are we still considered like a bar sport and this and that you know like i'm talking about some years ago yeah that that perception has been changed good and now we are
SPEAKER_00: I mean, we are growing, you know, we, I made a community poll on YouTube. There was 41,000 people. They, they voted on my channel. Yeah. Whenever I checked the, the, the, the, uh, Islam Makache Volkanovski, they were like almost 400,000 was on the UFC official channel. So it was like 10% of them, you know, of course.
SPEAKER_01: like they we are like far away you know by the way but every everything needs to start from somewhere right you cannot just start from here you know the important is like if the direction is here or not it is it is going up you know so that that's awesome and that's what you have to keep looking at that it is steady going up um for sure but it's great i'm excited to be a part and social media has a major influence in that you know people posting and getting big influencers outside of uh
SPEAKER_01: Like Larry Wheels and all these other bigger name influencers to start arm wrestling. It really, you know, it boosts the arm wrestling stock and say, hey, this is actually like a real sport and people are doing it. You know, these guys are doing it. Maybe I'll do it, too. So I think that helps a lot, too, with community and bringing outside people that have never done it to it. So, yeah, it's great. You know, I think it's going to keep going. The trajectory is going to keep going up and up.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I wanted to ask you another question. You said you are in both powerlifting and arm wrestling. How do these sports affect each other, you know, in a mostly positive way or negative way? It cannot be negative because even though you are not full-time arm wrestling guy, you are still successful. So most of them are coming from the other sports, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, it...
SPEAKER_01: It affects it a little bit, like some training-wise sometimes. Like if, say, for instance, if I have a heavy bench day and my elbows are sore the next day because of that, I won't really be able to give as much as I can in the arm wrestling aspect for training. So it kind of affects it. The recovery time, I would say, is the most. Yeah, problematic part. Exactly, exactly.
SPEAKER_01: But other than that, I kind of think it does help translate. Like a lot of my strengths in powerlifting has translated over to the arm wrestling table as well. You know, just keeping tight, like with my chest and benching and everything, keeping tight or back and rows and deadlifts. They really do. I feel like they help a lot. You know, it's not 100%. There's still so many different things in arm wrestling you need to do. You can't just be a strong powerlifter.
SPEAKER_00: But you have to learn and adapt and do other things. Okay. Archers Madhouse. Louisiana representing on the big stage. Way to go, Robbie. Yeah. Yeah, he's a good guy. He's on our team. Yeah, I think he's from Arkansas. Yeah, he's a real good guy. Yeah. In the past, there was...
SPEAKER_00: Team Louisiana, very famous. They had the red shirts and the blue jeans. They go national championships. Ray Henrichs. Do you know Ray Henrichs? I do. I do know Ray. Olin Lucas. Do you know Olin Lucas? I know Olin, yep. I know him very well as well. And there was...
SPEAKER_00: RJ Molinaire, you ever heard of him? Yes. He still goes every tournament to Louisiana State and Mississippi State. He's there every year. But how about Robert Redden? You didn't hear about him. What's his name? Robert Redden. I don't think so. He might have been a little bit before. It was like 20 years ago he was competing. But all his names, Ray Hendricks, RJ Molinaire, Olin Lukas, Craig Tuller,
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I lived in the U.S. for like six years. Okay. During those times, I pulled all the time with these guys. Yeah. Yeah, that's awesome. I didn't even know you lived in the States for a little bit. Yeah, I did. I did in Missouri and New York and Chicago, but I was competing all over, you know. Yeah, yeah. I was competing everywhere. I was competing in Tahoe, California, New York, Ohio.
SPEAKER_00: Kansas, Nebraska, everywhere, you know. So what was your peak, like your weight class, you'd say you dominated the most of your career. What weight class were you? One second. Somebody is just, my weight class, it started from 121. It went up to 165 official world championships categories. And I won world championships.
SPEAKER_00: in all those categories. But when I was in the US, I was even competing sometimes super heavyweight category. Wow. Yeah, I have won like eight categories, like seven categories. I competed Petaluma, California World Championships, WWC. And I'm still the only person in the history that won the half of the
SPEAKER_00: classes in the world championships. I won five categories out of 10. And then I think later John won five categories, but there was 12 categories. So it didn't really mean helping. How many times did you go against John when you were in the US? Did you go against him? When I was in the US, when I met John, I was 63 kilos. He was 100 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: Like, yeah, even the super heavyweights couldn't do much to John. But John, after the match, told me that if I was as heavy as him, I would beat him. That's what he told me, talking about 26 years ago. Yeah. Was your right or your left arm as dominant as your right? Both. Both have multiple world titles, yeah. Awesome. Awesome.
SPEAKER_00: My left is still nowhere near my right. I mean, it's strong. It's just the connection. It's not there yet. You know, I need to get more. I don't know why. Like I can, I can play with ball with my right foot. Left, I cannot, but when I arm wrestle, I can use both. I can even say the left is even more, more technical. Really? Really? Do you know why? Do you know why? I think that this is because.
SPEAKER_00: Like if you are balanced guy, then like when you arm muscle, most of the guys are right dominant. Yeah. And then with left, because your left is close to your right. You are the guy who has the control. You can do many things. While with right, like while you're growing, everything is close. So you are getting stronger.
SPEAKER_01: but technically you cannot really because you are not much stronger you understand yeah it's tough competition yeah yeah like for my left my left wrist i feel like i'm so much more versatile and able to do different things other than my right but my right still way dominant you know it's just it's night and day you know it's not even close can you what
SPEAKER_01: Can you only hook or can you top roll as well? I get, so I've been real ever since I talked with Devon, you know, I was always an inside puller and, and he really pointed out like, you know, always have that hook as a back, like, like in the background, like if, if you need to go there, you can do it. So, but I really can work my weakness was, which was always my top roll. So I've been really working my rise. I've been doing what Devon said, rise and roll all the time. So.
SPEAKER_00: I've been really working that. I can press. I can flop wrist press. So I'm becoming more versatile. I can do different things if I get in different positions. I would suggest that you work with really thick handles. When you do pull-ups, you can even choose some flat surface without using, you understand? It is just like here. Here is actually working, you know?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it will help your tendons more. When you grab it and put it like this, it's getting so much support from the muscles, your flexors. While when you do this, it is really working good on your tendons. Is that how you get those big wrists like you? Doing all that? Look at the size of those things. God. That's like two of my wrists. That's awesome.
SPEAKER_00: I saw you do, it's like a board and you're doing pronation with it. It's like, you know what I'm talking about? It's like a little wood board and you have it to a weight stack and you're doing that. Yeah, like this. One side is like a rope. Sometimes I put rubber band. The other one is connected to the cable with the weights. So I press from the supination side and then I only use the pronation out like with the weights.
SPEAKER_00: Here it's more like static, while outside is dynamic. I used to do that both sides with the rubber band, but I was making this rubber band shorter. So whenever I tried to do this, there was more pressure on the pronation side. Okay, okay. I mean, there are a lot of ways, but trust me, a lot of people are overpronating. You need to pronate, but you really need the balance
SPEAKER_00: uh with your supination and then controlling your opponent's pronation over pronation is often ending up something like this while you need to control here and then pronate you need to con this is most important even more important than this like there is an arm that you need to bring down while you are actually living there and over pronated this is over pronated yeah yeah you need to
SPEAKER_00: Here is to block the opponent's arm, you know, this side. And the radius side is to block the person's hand. And here is to block the pronator. So you need to use here, here, and here. To do over something is ending up with less pressure to opponent's arm here. Because you are giving up here. You need to...
SPEAKER_00: press here and then even more press with the pronator instead of like this, something like this, it is not the ideal way. Sometimes you need to do it, but if you are working on something to build like ideal way, that's the way you need to follow them. Same thing with strap pulling. Do you feel, do you feel more connected in the strap? Do you like it better in the strap when you're, when you're arm wrestling rather than just without the strap?
SPEAKER_00: no i mean i i often even ask my opponents like you want to go strap you know like yeah yeah i i like to go to strap but there was a there was an argument between i and devon that he was saying that like if one of the pullers wants to have strapped they should automatically get it and i said no i mean both sides needs to uh ask for it you understand like you cannot
SPEAKER_00: like force someone to start with it because arm wrestling is originally a sport without the strap. Yeah. You understand? That is like once the hands cannot control, then you can put it, but there is something, a beauty in the hand control that something you cannot do in the strap, but without strap, you can just come forward and slide your hand and then, you know, control everything, you know?
SPEAKER_00: So we cannot take that away from arm wrestling. It will just make arm wrestling less of arm wrestling. We need to have this. If it is necessary, we put the strap. But if both athletes come to the table, they say, I want strap, I want two, then let's go. But one says that I want to do it without the strap, you cannot tell him, no, you're going to go strap. Exactly. For me, it's no problem. Yeah, I like it. For me personally, obviously, I like the strap better.
SPEAKER_00: I feel more comfortable in a strap. I feel like I'm able to actually get a little more containment and more rise. It just feels everything's more connected for me in a strap. Yeah, yeah. Whenever you have stronger here, the strap always helps better. The more I get older, the more I need a strap because in the past when I was young, I was feeling like my brain
SPEAKER_00: is in my hand i could even close my eyes and just feel it like like it's like a computer more i get older that the signal is reaching here slower so i don't really feel my hand also you have so many injuries here without yes you know so much more pressure come once you put the step the guy cannot really get away you know now when you put the step it is more of wrist less of fingers you know
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah and then that's what i choose that one yeah yeah i like how it is with the strap it's less of the fingers and more of the wrist flexion and everything yeah yeah i saw you uh um who are you going against that uh waf champ a heavyweight super heavyweight you were training with them i think i just saw a video of you oh but there is i trained last two training i did one with rfm which is senior world champion
SPEAKER_00: Heavyweight. The other one was the masters, grandmasters, over 50 years old. The last one I trained, but he's also very strong. Nothing like Arif. Arif is a different guy, you know. Arif has even a win against Levan in the past. He has won against Gennady, Krasimir, even Georgi Tsvetkov, he beat. Arif is one of the really top guys, you know. Why you ask that?
SPEAKER_00: No, I was just watching the video and it looked like your pronation was still intact and your back pressure just looks like... You're talking about the last video, right? Last video. The last video. Oh, yeah. Erkan Damar is the Grandmaster World Champion. Yeah, it doesn't look like you really ever lose your wrist at all. You're always able to keep your... I mean, wrist, pronators, lats, these are where I am very good at it. The problem with that, if you realize it, like,
SPEAKER_00: Like it is right here, the connection, because no matter what, you take everything, you need to finish it. So all these parts over here, you know, backside of your arm, you know, where the lat and the trapezius, this needs to be very healthy. Otherwise you will have to hold it forever like this. You need to actually press the guy. So that is where I didn't feel comfortable. That's why I...
SPEAKER_00: cancel the match. I really wanted to do that. Trust me, my form is good, but if you would see how I fell down, I put the belt up there, and I was like this, holding my own weight, and whenever it got broken, I hit, boom. I never thought that I would hit that badly. It was just so terrible. Right on the floor? I mean, probably a little bit early here,
SPEAKER_00: yeah where the trapezius here and then right away after the head if i would directly hit my head most likely you know i would be in coma or something you know because it was yeah yeah that's that um yeah i've done something similar to that before and it kind of put me out for a little bit and
SPEAKER_01: You know, it's hard to recover a little bit, but you'll get back for sure. You'll get back to your normal. Yeah, yeah. I need to. I need to. This is just so, like, this is crime against the arm wrestling community if I quit arm wrestling this early. I need to. I need to. No, you're not going to quit. You're going to keep going. I will. I will. I will. What's your weight right now? So I'm, like, 205 pounds. I don't know what that is in kg. About 93 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: 93, yeah, I'm about 93. 93, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I'm sitting around there comfortably. I could cut if I needed to, you know. So probably 187, lowest you can cut probably. That would be, yeah, that would be the absolute lowest I can cut, you know. Yeah, probably the best one is 198. Yeah, 198, 195, that's perfect. That's perfect, you know.
SPEAKER_01: And I'm really competitive at like 190 to 195. That's where I feel like I can, you know, be possible. How tall are you? Like 5'10", 5'10". And do you have any upcoming targets? No upcoming targets. I kind of like, like I said, I want to pull these Europeans. I would love to get on the table with Coach Ray to see how we go. Oh, yeah, table game. Yeah, it would be nice. Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_01: Coach Ray is awesome. Like I said, I've seen him. I've always watched him. He's so technical. He's awesome. I've seen him arm wrestle Artem. I've arm wrestled Artem a bunch of times. How is your wrist? Do you think you can protect your wrist against Ray or you would want to try him inside only?
SPEAKER_01: I would love to try both, honestly, right now. How about me to set this match right now for East versus West? If you want to do it, I'll do it for sure. I'm not going to back down. Artem you serious? I will just ask him. For sure. I'll definitely, definitely do it. How is your speed? I think it's great. I think it's great. If you gave me a match with Coach Ray, I promise it would be a great match. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I will call him right after this live. Yeah, ask Artem knows. I mean, I almost asked Brad Grundy, you know, Brad Grundy that just competed. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They could vouch for me. I mean, I've after pulled Brad and we've never competed. Obviously, Brad would beat me, but I think I'm right there right now ever since I've been training for the past. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I love when the things are not so calculated and like, you know, let's go, you know. Yeah, yeah. I'm never going to back down. Okay, just let me see. Let me see if he's available. Maybe I can even ask him right now. I don't know. I'm a nobody to Coach Ray, so if he turned me down, that's completely fine. But I'm just saying I would want to do it, you know. It would give me a good test to where I am too, you know.
SPEAKER_01: uh-huh yeah but i appreciate that i appreciate that but listen i i take the word from you so now well we we may not make the cards ready but let's see yeah and i'll be uh and i'll pull on the after table or the after pool you are saying that you are fine with this
SPEAKER_01: If it is in the event, event. If it is after pool, after pool. Okay, you're ready. Okay. Hey, if you said we need to do it at that event on the after pool table, I'll do a best out of five, best out of three, whatever. Yeah. Okay. If you want me to prep, I'll prep. It doesn't matter. I would just love to see where I'm at right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My current form, I'm pretty good right now. Okay, okay. That's good. Yeah, it will be, it will be, it will be. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I think your nephew, Pamela. Okay, how do I pronounce your name? Karsten Dyck? Karsten Dyck, yes. Wow, I did good. Because I didn't know how to do it. I just read it. For me, it's like, because I never pronounced before, so I really didn't know. No one really gets it right. Ramos. Oh, geez.
SPEAKER_00: I have a guest on my channel, Robby. Robby is the son of Rob Carson Dyke, the owner of the VitaCell. And he is an armwrestler, and a good strong armwrestler. He is normally a powerlifter, and he wants to pull against you. Yeah, he is about 93 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. If you are ready, he may even pull in next event. Yeah. Maybe this event. If not, maybe another event. But would you pull him? Or after, even after pull, he says. It doesn't matter. Where? After pull or during the event?
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so you are saying that in this event you cannot beat him. Okay, I understand. Am I provocative enough? Hold on, let me get ready. I'm ready. I'm just provoking you, just having fun. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, but we, we will, okay. After pool, you pull him. He is because he is helping me a lot with the production and everything.
