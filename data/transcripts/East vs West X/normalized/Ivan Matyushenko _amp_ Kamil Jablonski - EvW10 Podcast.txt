Speaker: Thanks.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Adnan. Hello, Mohammed. Thank you, guys. Thank you. I hope you guys are fine. Waiting for
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Gabriele. Hello, Michael Workspace. Hello, Lacombe.
SPEAKER_04: waiting for my guests and one is a legend the other one is dark i think you one just came sorry i cannot read i always love to watch thank you muhammad hello hello victor hello ivan how are you my friend you hear me
SPEAKER_04: Do you hear me, Ivan? I don't hear you. No. I hear you now. Do you hear me? Hello, yes. Yeah, that's good. How have you been? How are you? Thank you. Good. And you? A bit tired. A lot of work.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, okay. Can you turn your phone sideways? Thank you, yeah. A lot of work. How is your shape? Right arm feels good? For many years you had inflammation on your arm. Yesterday I had a hard training and just felt a little, but it's okay. I will have to rest more.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah so it's a signal for your signal so sometimes bicep right your bicep uh yes um you know long um long tendon yeah yeah um yes it's quite quite common i think for for us not for me for me it's always elbows because
SPEAKER_00: You know, always here, all the pressure of the elbow, yeah. And I had this injury when I tried to top roll Zelimkhan Zankarkhanov. Oh, okay. And when I tried to top roll him, he supinated my pronation, my forearm. And yes, and in this position, there was an injury. And after that, for
SPEAKER_04: maybe i don't know 12 years uh it inflames sometimes that's interesting it's a long time long time yeah i only one time had a bicep injury and then he ended up with it uh there you know whenever whenever i pull arthur second round i put my feet right feet to the corner like there
SPEAKER_04: and then so I pull it and then whenever I pull he I took everything and then more I pull I made a mistake there is nothing to take with the hand anymore so I pull his left with my arm so my arm was like you know
SPEAKER_04: just open but i won that round because i took everything so he couldn't resist anymore but after the next round my arm was just like right away you know it opened like this yeah um we will see we will see how it will be what's the injuries yeah really really big problem for our sports here so how is your shape
SPEAKER_00: Well, shape is good. Yes, yes. My right is perhaps the same as my left. Oh, that's good. That's good, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Finally, because I have been asking, offering you matches with right arm, and you are like, no, I'm not ready, the inflammation. And now finally, finally, it's ready. So when you asked me, I could hardly raise my arm. No, no, I understand. I couldn't raise it, actually, because it was so inflamed. But some months later, it's okay. Yeah. So be careful, because there is less than five weeks now. And so...
SPEAKER_04: michael workspace thank you for your super chat looking strong and you can't wait for east versus west 10 11 11 november 11 yes yeah yeah so what i just said i'm happy that uh your right arm is alpha back yeah thank you yeah you are you are for sure one of the legends of our sport and
SPEAKER_04: I really hate when such a great arm wrestler, when he can still arm wrestle, but cannot because of the injury, that is really bothering me. Because I would love to see all the superstars together.
SPEAKER_04: i believe in synergy synergy is the key even for arm wrestling synergy is the key the the coordination of the muscle groups together the same you know arm wrestling is great but when we are all together you know that that is my goal you know to unite everyone east west everywhere you know all the superstars that we were divided for many years you know yeah from previous years well
SPEAKER_04: For many years, it was like this many years he was divided, you know we didn't really see Americans in the eastern push. meeting each other this regularly only if you have this and those were mostly super heavyweights you know like. I was Richard black, because you know the the all the attention was there still the most attention is there, but now i'm trying to involve more you know remember. yeah.
SPEAKER_04: uh so there is a question assalamu alaikum uncle so one is a super heavyweight arm master now no he one is not super heavyweight arm master but he can pull super heavyweight there is no problem same as alijan is only like 105 kilo but is able to pull super heavyweight successfully maybe one is not good enough to be
SPEAKER_00: top five right now but he can successfully pull most of the Supraways do you agree that he won well I can pull everyone but I can win maybe yeah but you know what I mean you know what I mean well I think that left hand I have a potential to maybe be top five maybe
SPEAKER_04: yeah but i'm not sure about right hand if it is healthy maybe but um now i have some doubts how do you see this how do you see the left arm you know left arm top five as of now like do you see do you see like laletin is there morozov is there maybe kurdecha if levan comes back levan
SPEAKER_04: I don't know if Denis is there because he's not ready as far as I know. He's not even really training. Ali Can, do you think Ali Can is possibly in the top five or not? Maybe. Like me. Okay. So you were with Ali Can. 115 kilos would be an incredible 115 kg world title match. It would be great, yes. Yeah. If Devon, Devon is also there. You, Devon.
SPEAKER_04: know alijan also even daddy can even though he lost against prudnik but he was one category below when when daddy can is 115 kilo i think he's different different guy you know just also prudnik also prudnik
SPEAKER_04: uh is also very generous for me yeah i kind of think that krudnik will never be 150 again you know he doesn't want that as far as i understand he can pull but i don't think i mean according according to according to what he said himself what he told me yeah he says that he feels healthier good you know 105 it doesn't mean that he's not gonna pull 115 kg he can but i don't think he will be 115 kg we will see who knows
SPEAKER_00: I think that's exactly like you think. Levan, Valetin, Morozov, maybe Kurdech, I don't know, but I haven't seen him pulling left hand. Yeah, he needs to pull, yeah, he needs to start pulling, yeah, you're right. And that is perhaps all.
SPEAKER_00: Ah, and of course Devon. I think he's much stronger than he talks about his left hand. His left is also very good, I think. Yeah, not bad for sure, not bad. Yes, Levan, Laletin, Morozov, Devon, maybe Denis, yes, and then maybe some lighter guys.
SPEAKER_04: Ah, Dziranov. Dziranov also is good. Do you think that Dziranov has any chance against those guys that you mentioned? He made some progress. He had problems with his wrist, so it's very difficult for him to pull top rollers. But those guys, all of them can top roll. Morozov can top roll, Kurdesha can top roll, Laletin can top roll, Levan can top roll, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: but he's getting bigger and bigger yeah yeah the last time you saw right you saw me in istanbul wow i was like what is this you know his shoulder head was like the head big in head size you know like his fingers fingers like dennis's start to be like that yeah the guy is just getting wow i mean there's potential but this is this is like this is
SPEAKER_04: like incredible you know to see all these guys together it just makes me like wow it's just like a dream dream like and then in a regular ways all the time you know we see them yeah people see i i don't know where where camille is i don't know where camille is
SPEAKER_00: anyway so what's your weight right now 112 100 yes 12 13. perhaps uh i'll eat some more and be 114 15 maybe but i'm not i'm not sure that i will be stronger if i get this weight yeah yeah yeah i mean yeah sometimes you know just like
SPEAKER_04: It's unnecessary. Like, like, look at, look at Devon. Devon was like 119, 120 when he pulled Hermes. And people said, oh, you're going to get destroyed. Now he's 115 kilo or 16 kilo. People say, oh, you're going to get destroyed. Hello, hello, hello, tell me. I'm sorry. I don't understand your message. Oh.
SPEAKER_04: yeah whenever whenever i said it was like with our time was like 7 30 so i said 30 minutes later you know just like it means like hey look yeah yeah i i thought you'll be late 30 minutes so i thought it would be 7 30. i was just relaxing doing some photos and no no 30 minutes can you put the phone somewhere this is all because it's just turning so much it's like yeah i will do yeah it's
SPEAKER_04: yeah also can you put it sideways yeah it is it is sideways yeah is it okay because on the computer still showing like 10 15 seconds ago so okay now i see yeah thank you so how are you camille do i pronounce your name correct camille yeah the name is fine camille but okay yeah
SPEAKER_04: Kamil Jablonski or Jablonski? The correct one is Jablonski. Okay, Kamil Jablonski. Okay, that's good. Kamil, how are you doing? Good shape? I see some ways you are lifting, pressing, you know, how comes your shape? Yeah, my shape is very good. I keep training nicely and I'm feeling very strong and
SPEAKER_03: I do some rest as well. So I've got like about 10 days rest for my, uh, for my side pressure. So I give it rest to get healthy and, um, but I training other beats and yeah, I think I, I will be very, uh, strong on the day. And then you're going to meet this guy. I will do my best. I will do my best.
SPEAKER_03: will do this guy is a top level guy i never meet anyone like that so i don't know what to expect really so it's it's hard to say i i can go and go and just beat him it's really hard to say like that so you will do your best and you will see yeah exactly i'll do my best and i hope i can win
SPEAKER_04: Yep. Yep. But just, just understand I'm a promoter, so I will try to steal the pot in every opportunity. Okay. Yeah. So is your shape gonna be even better than when you pull Dave Chaffee? Uh, I, I think, um, I, I have much more time to prepare.
SPEAKER_03: for the guy who i will pull because i already find plenty video of ivan on youtube i take all information what i needed he was testing his power of fingers of back pressure of this of wrist so i know what i work with so i preparing to to to win the
SPEAKER_04: the best place i can something like i can't go to his strongest point so you know that that's my way so we'll see just the other day you share a video that you know you said that camille can only press and you put those those top roll videos yeah as a friend i will suggest you don't listen to me you want to just close your ears and don't try to top roll him
SPEAKER_03: no this is this is nothing about him because uh people saying i know i am joking joking i only i only pressing but i i you know i do top roll as well but what is the point for me to go and and use something what is maybe not the best so it's it's simple you go and you're using your best gun especially i am i am very fast so i really don't make tired if i press someone very quickly i have no tired at all
SPEAKER_03: And how do you find Ivan stylistically? For your style? I think he's the most problem for me. His power is the most danger for my press. Is it because to press you need your pronator and he's exactly hidden there? Yeah, something like that.
SPEAKER_03: I don't like hookers, you know, but I have already experienced with one guy who hooked me in Dubai. He was from Ivan and he was weighed like 180 kilograms and he gave me a lesson how to work with the strong hook. So I think I took that lesson from him and I will try to fix that on this match on 11 November.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, and one last question before I ask to Ivan. How do you rate your speed compared to Ivan's? You know, it's hard to say because speed on the no pressure can be different than the speed to put the pressure on, you know. So it depends how fast you put the pressure in the time.
SPEAKER_03: So I don't know how fast Ivan can, from the, let's say, free power, how fast he can put 100% power. So could be similar. I saw his video. He is very fast as well. But, you know, it's... What do you mean? What do you mean like he is applying pressure 100%? How can you apply 100% pressure before the goal? Not before the goal. After the goal... No, no, no. I'm talking about the start.
SPEAKER_03: because after the start you know the speed doesn't matter you know that's why i'm saying the start is about speed is about to start that's what i say yeah yeah but many uh many heavy guys uh pullers are already uh already are already uh on before go they are already uh use the power something like that
SPEAKER_03: uh yeah and then i i am not i'm different and uh this problem have with me dave uh chafee he just couldn't set up with me because i was just like freehand you know oh but this is what also you want like so you bought like the same thing very very fast you know the wrist movement you know you know he i when was a referee set up they already want to pull and i just give him the hand and they say no
SPEAKER_03: uh you know move in the referee setup so they have really big problem with this you know he just he just want to be ready pull the pressure back and not just giving to him everything do you do you do you think that do you think that e1 is type of guy that likes to apply pressure before the goal no he is different this that's why i think you both are the same you know this is what i try to say
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, this will be very dangerous. This will be very dangerous. When we will meet after go, I don't know what will happen. This is why I said about the speed, you know, this is why I said about the speed. That is interesting. And you, Ivan, how do you find his style compared to yours? Is it a style that bothers you or you are comfortable with that kind of style? You mean triceps?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I do not like this style as much as I like top rollers. But actually, I think that the advantage has the person who starts first. If a shorter roller starts first, it's very difficult to stop him.
SPEAKER_00: And if I start first, it will be difficult for him to stop me as well.
SPEAKER_04: yes the speed will be the key to victory i think yeah so okay that was the right question that when i asked him you know how he writes his speech comparison because you are known you know i i saw uh one guy made your last match video like 0.25 speed and then after that you know that slow motion four times slower than the actual one your speed was still like this
SPEAKER_04: you are using your hand and wrist so quick, you know, so quick. But again, couples are going exactly against where you are the most powerful while coming will go most to your arm, you know. As you said, the speed will really, it will be a deciding factor. You know, this is what I believe, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Those who shoulder press it's very important how their shoulders are set. What's that? How their shoulders are set. I mean, it's very important how the referee sets the shoulders. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, the referee will set everything according to the rules, you know, like both shoulders.
SPEAKER_04: and the wrist will be straight. You know, that is how we feel. We don't have ready-go, as you know. We have, like, shoulders square, everything square. Devon't move. Still no move. Go! You know, that's what it is, you know. So that was... There was some complaining about a certain match. And then we decided to go that way.
SPEAKER_04: Rick Haro, high engine. Can I ask which foods they are eating? Okay, what do you eat generally? I think this is what Rick is asking. Thank you for your super chat. What do you eat?
SPEAKER_03: yeah so every morning i eat about six eggs with some kind of avocado tomatoes and other vegetables so that's my routine every morning eggs eggs but in the daytime just plenty meat rice and stuff like that i i don't do any diet i just eat as much as i want and every day my wife make for me a protein shake like three portions for all day so i'm drinking drinking so
SPEAKER_03: I think my body is fully loaded all the time with the fruits. I don't blame you for not dieting, it's a superior weight. Yeah. What's your weight, Kamil? Me? 128 all the time, same. What's your height? 189, something like that. 189? 189 centimeters. 189, yeah. And I think, Ivan, you are around there, 190 maybe? Yes.
SPEAKER_04: yes 192 maybe 192 192 perhaps yeah okay and you do you have any special diet or no no also eggs meat fish uh everything bread yeah whatever whatever wife puts front vegetables yes yeah but but it's not like you don't have any program i'm gonna eat this i'm gonna eat this but whatever
SPEAKER_00: Like, do you have any daily program of eating? No special program, but I have some... Well, I try to eat first protein. I mean, first eggs, then something else. Yes. First fish, chicken, and then something else. Maybe a lot of vegetables, fruit. Nothing special. I understand. I understand. Yeah. And so...
SPEAKER_04: one is 128 kilo the other one is 100 and and coming your left is right now stronger than your right or is about the same how is it uh it's uh my press on left arm is uh is much more
SPEAKER_03: uh, powerful than on the right, uh, because I have some, uh, some pains on my right arm, but I fixing this. And I think if I'll fix the pain, I will have same power. Actually, uh, the right arm wrist is stronger, but the left fingers are a little bit stronger. So it's very close to be honest. It's not big different. Uh, let's say right pronation is stronger.
SPEAKER_03: but quite a lot then left left one is not that much like 20 right pronation is stronger but uh fingers let's say uh like 120 kilo i can hold easy this right hand may be like five kilo left so it's very almost the same almost the same yeah i understand so if you use good good anti
SPEAKER_03: inflammatory, you know, then then you will be pain free, you can still perform it. Yeah, I hope I hope I hope but I don't want to test my my elbow with big weights yet. Maybe before the competition, I will go slowly up to make them ready. Then maybe I'll take one and a half week off to get rest. And I should be something similar like with Dave, I warm up very nice with Dave. And I have no pain at all. So I go full power.
SPEAKER_04: and and and it was good yeah and even it come he said that you know he he found all your videos and analyzing you know do you have any special preparation for him or you do your own training
SPEAKER_00: Maybe a little special preparation against the triceps move. Maybe some more work on the center to take the center, yes, from the start. Yeah, just a little. Actually, that's my usual routine, actually. Yeah, yeah. So, but you are just now more focused.
SPEAKER_00: to the center, so you wouldn't want him to put the shoulder behind his head? Just to take this position, yes. And also, like, with match with Davit, I will not train hard wrist, fingers, not for a top roller. I think Kamil is not a top roller, actually. Maybe he uses it sometimes, but maybe not top level. Let me see.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah yeah you even i saw you you want to hook vitality you know so i mean trying to top roll you i'm not talking about uh camille i i don't exactly know his effectiveness outside you know but um it is very very hard to i mean to beat you inside ivan is more possible than beating you with top roll do you agree with that
SPEAKER_00: Sure, sure. But Laletin was not that Laletin that he is now. It was the 118 Laletin. 2018 or 19, however it was. He was small then. Now I think I will not be able to... I understand, but at that time, who was able to hook him? I don't know. Yeah, this is what I meant to say, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it will be an incredible match. And I think that I and you two and the people who are watching this podcast, they all realize that it is all about the center, you know, and then we will see what will happen. And Kamil, generally, how did you like the card, you know, the November 11 card? It's just amazing, you know.
SPEAKER_03: i am so happy i am i am at this one it's just amazing so many great pullers and first time i will meet john jank which is so cool as well personally and uh yeah i can't wait and what i want to say is well about my preparation uh when i have a qualification on the east vs west and i have a fight with kalinchenko
SPEAKER_03: uh i i was losing with him the start he was doing a bit far starts and i changed my training after that because i thought i was always working from position where is
SPEAKER_03: already center and then go and i start training to start from outside you know to pulling from outside when it's something like i lost the center then i am able to stop and pull back so i make stronger especially my back for this to don't let to don't let the arm out so my back is now much stronger than before because i was like i say focusing on this exercise on this move so um
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I hope Ivan is very similar on the power with me. That's what I see. Even chest, bench press, everything is so similar. So I'm so excited how this will happen, really. Yeah, yeah, it's good. I mean, anyone who deserves will be invited. You know, this is what it is, you know. Like it is, we welcome anyone, anyone who is at that level and you prove yourself.
SPEAKER_00: and then yeah you are invited and i'm happy that you are happy to be here and and if you want do you think that this this may be the the best card so far every time every time i think so with every new east west i think that it is the best one um yeah so so far yes i think that um that will be perhaps the best card ever yeah in terms in terms of uh
SPEAKER_04: quote and how many good umphires yeah yeah i mean people people always says the same thing they say but i hear this from like maybe 100 people they say every time you say it cannot get any better next one is better i cannot promise that it will always get better and better and better but i will try to keep their level and sometimes even better but
SPEAKER_04: Um, it is, if, if something is getting better, it is because there is a potential. So we, we have that potential, like nobody is making miracle, you know, something, you know, magic or something that are great arm masters. All I do is just gather them together. And then we are just representing our sport at the, the highest level. And if you guys don't mind, would you guys like to share your predictions about the, the, the.
SPEAKER_04: uh matches on the uh card yes no problem yeah okay so let's me first yannes sorry if i pronounce your name incorrectly sorry about it asking any tips to get in the hook against apples
SPEAKER_00: to get people in hook? Do you have any suggestion? On the one hand, strength, on the other hand, speed. So, strength of wrist, supination, and fingers, first of all. It starts with fingers, with small finger. So, just... And also, I would say, shoulder pronation.
SPEAKER_04: is important to have to have this yeah yes so shoulder pronation but first of all wrist fingers and supination yeah and the the great coordination of this all these three yeah yeah yeah and okay so let's start about the uh predictions um let's start with
SPEAKER_04: coming um 95 kilo um iraqli zrakashvili always came here 99 kilo 100 kilo you know he was like he really have been he has been pushing himself to gain weight but even when he pulled 105 kilo he never was 105 kilo i mean at least i don't remember i i checked their weights
SPEAKER_04: normally 99 kilo 100 kilo sometimes with the shoes and pants you know like that but he in his mind he just wanted to gain weight but obviously he couldn't so i said i asked him you know why not 95 kilo you know why you are always like with this advantage you know pulling um heavier guys and then he said okay and then i offered him a match against ruslan baber and
SPEAKER_04: I'm sure, Kamil, you are familiar with Rustam. And one is, you know, I always say this in other podcasts as well. I want to share as well before I ask. You know, we have seen Irakli losing. But if you realize he's losing against the top rovers. Like Ongarbaev took his wrist. Dadikyan, outside movement still. And he also lost his wrist. He won, but against John.
SPEAKER_04: But when he pulled Krasimir, when he pulled Lachlan, you know, against the people that, you know, going inside and he has the wrist, then he is not losing. Of course, he doesn't mean he's not losing. He lost against Sasho some years ago, more than two years, two and a half years ago. And then we know Rustam, but I don't even remember when last time he lost.
SPEAKER_03: is this but Rustam can also top roller you know what do you think about this match coming so basically I would love to win for Rustam but I am very worried for him as well because I saw last video of Irakli and this how he playing with the 130 kilos of the of the of the of the
SPEAKER_03: uh with the weights for the biceps it was really impressive so i think uh even iraqli is not so heavy like always he had the best shape now i think and um it i think it will be a very big war like maybe three two for rustam and i because the the problem with rustam is he don't have anyone to practice so strong and i know this is problem for him and um
SPEAKER_03: And this could be a little bit, you know, I don't know really how this can end up. There are some guys that can give him training this way and some other ways.
SPEAKER_03: this is not always the same because you know if you pull someone strong you can really get you know nice nice tired but if you pull with some extras you really don't know where is the limit and how you can hold it so it's not it's not the same but is as well is about the wrist control is in the power of the biceps is not everything is is about the wrist control you know you move your wrist a little bit and you're switching off the power of the opponent so
SPEAKER_03: you really need someone strong at the top level to to have a good um training to to make the muscles yeah i think you actually have some guys to pull uh if they don't show much who can replace
SPEAKER_03: not really replaced, but he has strong guys to pull there on the training. I see even the guy who holds from him the bar with the weights, he's strong as well. I forgot his name. Dadikam? Maybe. No, he's different. Arabuli. Arabuli, yes.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I'm sure Arabo is very strong, but judging by his match with Chance, not sure his wrist is comparable to Rustam, but I respect you. But if you are thinking that 130 kilo is translated in the table, trust me, this can also help even more, more realistic even to the table. So you are saying that Rustam is going to win 3-2?
SPEAKER_03: i hope i hope that's my prediction and i hope his chest will be enough strong to don't because you know he had some injury some time ago i hope he will fix everything and and we'll win it so that's my that's my man do you see there is any possible to wish them to go outside no i don't think no i am pretty sure rustam is all life in hook
SPEAKER_04: And let's go Ivan. Ivan knows Rustam very well for like almost 15 years. They play in the same events. And what do you think? In different categories. Yeah, yeah. But in the same events that you all the time follow, you know him very well. Once he beat me. Well, he was a little stronger than me at that time. Ivan, 12.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I think that if Rustam is healthy, he will be the first, not the first person to hook Irakli, if he's healthy. Maybe if he's healthy, I think he will take maybe two rounds. And in the third round, maybe Irakli stops him, maybe, and there will be some pulling. I think that Irakli is also good in hook.
SPEAKER_00: But he is slower and he will not be able to stop Rustam at the beginning. Well, if Rustam is healthy, I think he will win. But if there are any problems, then there will be a close match. So you are saying that for sure at the beginning of the match, Rustam will be dominant, but you are not sure if it is going to
SPEAKER_00: go the same way till the end or not? You don't know about that? Yes, I don't think that Irakli will top-roll Rustam. Maybe he will use his side more effectively later, maybe. Do you think, is there a possibility for Rustam to top-roll Irakli? Yes, also there is, because I remember that Rustam top-rolled Krissimir, maybe
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he has the ability, he has the ability, especially if it actually gives so much from the hand to not to be hooked, and then Rustam can quickly switch the outside, that's why I'm thinking. And also that he can show the way how to do it, so now Rustam can watch it and just repeat, so I think it is also a possibility.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Whenever I, I watch, uh, that he can training with, uh, Denis, I realized that that he kills hand risks, you know, the finger here genetically is super strong. I think is, this is my opinion. Yeah. And I, I am not sure if Rustam has the same genetic of the daddy cat, of course, very, very strong, but that, that, that like the wrist hand that daddy can has looks very, very dangerous. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But I think that Rustam was more dangerous in his prime. More like this way. Like Rustam is not only the hand wrist very strong, but also he had incredible inner side pressure that he was just crashing to people with this spinated side pressure. Do you think it was only because of the hand and wrist or it is because of also the incredible pressure, side pressure?
SPEAKER_00: uh something like uh i think he's something like he pulled like me he pulls like me uh so all in all it is speed wrist fingers and uh but no fingers they are small but very strong and also that uh pronation right that side yeah to me yours was like more like quick cupping for me his was like more like you know more more side pressure you know i i always saw you like
SPEAKER_04: like more about the very dominance, like you were just really dominating the opponent's pronator with your wrist. He also was dominating with wrist, but I think that pound for pound, maybe his inner side pressure, spinated side pressure, maybe was stronger. I don't know about pound for pound. Not like you are, of course, stronger, but you were heavier than him usually, you know. You were 100, 110 kilos. He was 80, 85 kilos in the prime zone.
SPEAKER_04: Anyway, so you both are thinking that Rustam is favorite? Like more edge? Yes. Maybe 55 against 45, something like that. Okay. And then, so let's go Sarah Backman versus Egle. So I don't know much about Egle to be honest.
SPEAKER_03: But I know quite a lot about Sarah. So I like to stay with my neighbor country friend, but I think Sarah will win. That's what I think. I can say much more because I don't watch too much Egle. I don't know really how she pulling, how she's strong. I believe you watch Egle more than he has seen Sarah. Yeah. Yeah. But you know,
SPEAKER_03: can everything can happen you know if you set up this match it's mean everything can happen yeah and how do you see that much you want
SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm not very good at women arm wrestling, actually, but I think that the class was, Aglis' class was a bit higher. Years ago, maybe five, ten years ago, she was, she always won world, Europeans, and Sarah perhaps not, not always. She also won, and perhaps it was a different category as well.
SPEAKER_00: So if we speak about 8-10 years ago, I would bet on Egle. But I haven't seen him pulling lately. So I don't know. I would bet maybe on Egle, but actually I don't know. As you said, 10 years ago, I set the match, super match for them. Do you remember the match Krasimir and John Poole 10 years ago? When I set that match,
SPEAKER_04: In the same event, also I said Egle versus Sarah. At that time, Egle won quite easily. But today is different, different Sarah. Egle is probably as good as that time because she has been training. But Sarah is much stronger compared to that time. But we will see. I see very close match as well. And then, okay, this one I always remind to people.
SPEAKER_04: I know Ivan wouldn't do that, but Kamil, as a person, you know, he may have too much respect and then may say something nice, but don't say it, you know. Davit Samushia and Engin Terzi, Kamil. Just say honestly. Yeah, I think it will be hard match. Won't be easy for any of you.
SPEAKER_03: But I think Davit Samushia will win, I think. Because of the endurance. Because if it's a tough match, it's the endurance to play a game, you know. Yeah, I think exactly because endurance. When I saw you in Kings of the Table, you were very fast. So I don't know really how long you can pull with that. I trained one month before that match only. Not a lot.
SPEAKER_04: yeah only one month since then I train okay but for different I'm training two months but I'm not starting from the where I was I put it over that and then two more months now so at that time maybe 80 percent now between 90 95 I will be but this is uh just my estimation but yeah we will see yeah
SPEAKER_00: me okay um well i think something like uh with rustam against directly but different technique uh i think that you have all the chances to win because of your technique so you are not comfortable for david but but endurance and your injuries so well i think
SPEAKER_00: You will take his wrist, yes, but will you be able to finish till then? Maybe not first, but later rounds, I'm not sure. Especially it's a title match, and you have to pull five rounds, not three, yes? Yeah, but after you count three, you know, five rounds, the rest is just for the spectators, for the fans, you know. Today, yesterday, I talked with my friends in the gym,
SPEAKER_00: Well, I think that is not very good, actually, for a person, for a winner of the match. If someone wins three rounds, and he becomes the world champion, and then he loses two rounds, and that is not very good for him, maybe, yes? At the end, you are winning, like, it is the same, like, just think about it.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I don't know. Like, it has always been like this. I don't know why. Like, pile for many years, it was six rounds. Armours for many years, it was six rounds. Tingo on the table, six rounds. Once I started to make it full five rounds and people started to criticize, I don't understand that. Well, I think that the...
SPEAKER_04: would suggest to do um to make a winner of five rounds so you have to win five rounds to become the uh yeah because why do if if i beat someone four times don't you think that i already prove i'm better than him why do i need to beat him five times to prove that i'm better like so like i will ask you something i will ask him you go training
SPEAKER_00: with your friend you started he beat you one time two times three times four times you know and then you start beating him if somebody asked you who was better you would say that you were better because after four times he beat you then you start beating him you know there are very there were very many questions after uh ermias levan's fight very many questions and many people wrote that uh actually levan lost because he didn't pull those two rounds
SPEAKER_04: No, he only lost two rounds. It's 4-2. You know, I don't even know why there was any, any, any, any subject, any, any even argument about that. Like the guy won four times, it finished, you know, just like, I mean, like, why not them best of nine? Why not 10 rounds? Why not 13 rounds? Like, I don't know where is the limit, you know?
SPEAKER_04: I'm just saying, you beat one time, you say, okay, it's explosiveness. You beat him two times, okay, still. You beat the guy three times, you know, okay, you prove the guy. I mean, if third round is not endurance, then what's the endurance, you know? Like, who's going to decide the endurance, you know? One, two, three, you know? Well, I think that three rounds is great. Like all your matches. Two, three, that is great. So I just...
SPEAKER_00: think that those two rounds are not uh they can make bad impression you win but you lose for example oh I think you may understand it so they uh what for are those rounds where do we need them I think I think you know what it is for it is like because fans would like to see maybe you would even try to just the I've been three rounds after that I mean just like
SPEAKER_04: I can do something different and then just see like how it's in the hook now. Let me do the slow start and see his power. Maybe I'm flashing the guy. So let's see if I do slow start, if I can still beat him or not. But I'm just saying that like it has always been like this for like more than 20 years there are super matches. Like you lost four times to Taras Ivan, but you guys still pulled the last two rounds as well, right? He beat you 6-0 or what?
SPEAKER_04: I didn't like that. I think three rounds would be enough for me. Okay, question for you, Ivan. What is the possibility, do you believe that in a fresh round I may take Samushia's wrist? Yes. You believe that? I think even in not the first round.
SPEAKER_04: i think maybe every round yes yes yeah i understand yeah yeah so you are saying that i should be working more on finishing power yes yeah yeah but i i must not forget about my pronator as well because if i cannot take his wrist then the match is already over so i need to spear there for sure you know but i think that what i need to do while i'm taking his
SPEAKER_04: I shouldn't be like depending on the brachial radialis, but I also need to control his pronator because if he has the pronator he can't do, but if I take his wrist and also turn him up like this, then it will be harder for him to apply pressure to control here.
SPEAKER_04: We will see. I will do my best. But on the paper, he is the favorite for sure. He proved himself. I proved myself. But in the past, not now. So I am the one who needs to prove himself. He has nothing to prove right now. He is for sure the clear favorite in this match. And I don't have any kind of context to admit this. So let's go another match. This one, I want only percentage.
SPEAKER_04: no no like no details i want to say you want i want to say this many percentage and this many percentage i'm starting with kamil kamil jablonski versus ivan matyshenko 55 for kamil 45 for ivan okay and you ivan let it be on the other way around
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so 55, Ivan, 45 coming. Okay, okay, that's fair enough here. And then that is another match. Fia Rysek was going to pull against Irina Gladkaya.
SPEAKER_04: And Irina told me, she said that this was her dream and she had been expecting an invitation from me. And then, but doctor said that I didn't even ask the detail, it's not my business to not to train for some time.
SPEAKER_04: and i believe her honestly 100 she was very um nice she said i can answer any kind of question you would like to ask i said no need i believe you and so i will invite her later on so rosa from costa rica she took second in wow she won the qualification um also uh at the east versus west and so
SPEAKER_04: Pia said that I would pull her. I said, Pia, you are only 70 kilos. This is heavyweight girl, you know. And she said she would pull it. Do you know Rosa, Ivan? You don't know, right? Sort of. And do you know Rosa Kamil? No. Okay, then it's hard to predict this match. Let's go to another one. Matt Mask versus Frank Lamparelli.
SPEAKER_03: I can say something about that. Okay, let's go. Because I was pulling with Lamparelli and then Matt Mask was pulling with Kalinichenko and I was pulling with Kalinichenko. So there is some connections. Yes, but different styles, many different styles, you know, meeting each other.
SPEAKER_03: yeah so there is some connections but there is one one one point kalinichenko lost weight to matt musk so probably he lost the power as well because when he pulled me he was like 130 kilograms and then he was 118 kilograms so so uh different power but i think i think matt musk will be uh winning this one i think will be stronger than lamparetti
SPEAKER_03: Because last time when I was watching Matt Mask, I think he's improving, improving. He's going up. I can see this. So, you know, Lamparelli, of course, is very strong as well. And this match will be like 60% to 40% for Matt Mask, I think. Anyone? Unfortunately, I do not know the shape of Lamparelli now. Disco to safety.
SPEAKER_00: uh know that they are both chop rollers and um perhaps much um levels are higher a little i pulled with uh lamparelli maybe 10 years ago he's not so big i think as uh as much so i would um i think that matt uh has advantage you said he's not that big
SPEAKER_00: I think he's not that big as Matt. Matt is maybe 200 centimeters, yes? He's like 197, and then Lamparelli is like 191 or something. Like 6 centimeters taller, you know. That's important, I think. Maybe not the height, but the levels of... I think that Lamparelli has something like my hand.
SPEAKER_04: yes i understand yeah so you both are thinking that matt is the favorite here okay let's go to another one uh versus uh you know both are big both are top rollers and uh but i think uh
SPEAKER_03: I don't see much from Paizulaev pulling on the table.
SPEAKER_03: And he is well saying on YouTube that he don't have much, uh, pulling, uh, training. So this could be a bit hard for him, uh, to pull Tsvetkov because, uh, he last a couple of months pulling, uh, quite a lot. And he had his well team strong team, uh, in Bulgaria to pull. So I think I go for Tsvetkov. He will win this one. It won't be easy for sure because the power of both are very, uh, high.
SPEAKER_00: But I will say like 70% for Tsvetkov, 34% for Palsuvaev. And you, Ivan? It's interesting. How do you see this one? I'm curious about your prediction. I agree that almost with everything that says Kamil in most matches. And it will be very difficult for Zaur
SPEAKER_00: Georgi is uncomfortable for him. He already beat him at WAF. Then Zaur was weaker than his top form. But now Zaur's form is not top. I think after injury, after that biceps injury he had maybe half a year ago, he's not at his top level. So now I think it will be difficult for Zaur.
SPEAKER_04: But I would say... We saw him at the AMC. We saw him at the AMC. He was not in top level. Still, Valentin had some hard time to finish him. But from the AMC July till the November is...
SPEAKER_04: more than uh four months it was beginning of july now almost middle of the november so here four months so we can expect him to be stronger right now but still maybe not at the top shape here unfortunately he had some problems in preparation with his injuries so i am not sure that he's in his 100 percent form yeah no he will not be here he's better than he pulled at work
SPEAKER_04: But he is worse than he was at AMC against Valitin in previous games. He will be stronger than the July event when he competed at AMC four months ago? I think no. Why is that? He had some problems. Why would he accept the match then? I think he accepts all matches.
SPEAKER_04: I mean that it's quite kind a little bit personal for him because he he he said that Georgi beat him and he is looking for the revenge uh yes but you know he um he every time that uh he um
SPEAKER_00: made videos to pull this person or that. He likes to pull and I think he's ready to pull everyone, but I think that he's not in 100% form. No, no, no, he is not 100%, but he just said that he came to do a podcast. I don't know if you watch, but he said that he will be more than 90% of his best
SPEAKER_04: No, I hope so. He said that he will be stronger, much stronger than the July event. That's what he said. Because in July event, he also lost against Schleyer. Well, you know, Zaur has some kind of champion psychology. He thinks that he will beat everyone sometimes. Do you think that he may be knowing his shape better than you do?
SPEAKER_00: We also talked. And from our conversation, I think that not so... When did you talk? Throughout these months. Maybe a month ago, two, three months ago. Just a little. And I know that it wasn't a smooth preparation. So not so... Okay. If he's sure, that's okay. I think it will be a hard match for both. I would say 50-50.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, okay. Anyway, so let's go another one. Sasho versus Artem Kaino. Kamil, left arm, 95 kilo world title match. Yeah, I saw Artem at the AMC and he was looking huge. But it's hard to say, to be honest. I'm not sure which match will be first for Sasho.
SPEAKER_03: John Frank or Artem? He's going to choose. I think Sasho will win, but it will be a similar match as well, I think. What do you mean similar? Like a close match? I think it will be hard to finish for Sasho and Artem.
SPEAKER_03: looks very strong r10 but i don't know how much how much he have in center uh if he can move such to his way probably not but uh not i'm not sure i saw sascha how he uh pulling and he had problems with uh finishing the guys uh to the past so artem maybe to let finish are you in the training
SPEAKER_04: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Oh Sasho is not with you. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Oh okay Okay, I was gonna ask because comedy was wondering, you know if Sasho is gonna pull first john or title so maybe maybe you just you just call him and ask him, you know which one she's gonna pull.
SPEAKER_04: ask ask sascha you know if he's gonna pull john first or artentino first in the event yeah okay thank you thanks okay okay um and and how do you see this much you want yeah yeah i want to say why i asked which
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so if he will pull first, he will have, you know, like more power to finish quickly. So maybe this will be easier for him. But later, if he'll be tired after jump jank, maybe it won't be easy match. So that's what I'm thinking. I understand. Okay, he's gonna choose and he's gonna, I'm gonna let him choose how many matches he wants in between. Yeah. Yeah. And Ivan, how do you see this match?
SPEAKER_00: I think it will be a close match, but I would bet on Artem. I think he had more time to prepare, yes. Okay, okay. I think it will be better than a 12. Yes, Georgi. Yeah. Okay, he wants first final match. Okay, okay, thank you, thank you.
SPEAKER_04: okay okay he's gonna tell me how many matches he wants in between and then we're gonna do because he's pulling two matches okay thank you thank you georgie yeah you too bye-bye um yep he's gonna pull tyno first yeah you remember the last match right he won at the world 2021 yeah
SPEAKER_04: Do you think that we can take that as an example? Or do you remember that before that match, right, one round before, Plamen and Sasho met, and they had a long match. You don't remember, right? Plamen came, Sasho here, and then Sasho was here, and then... So you think that helped a little, yes? Yeah, a little bit, a little bit, yeah. But it doesn't matter, you know. And Taynov didn't...
SPEAKER_04: have hard matches then do you remember because at that time there was only three favorites as well as as far as i remember playman sasho and tyno i i don't remember if there was anyone in del at their level but i don't remember maybe chersky maxim maybe maybe maybe did they have he and chesky met before them i think plumbing had a difficult match with chersky perhaps yeah
SPEAKER_04: In the B side or the A side? I think A side, maybe first match or second. Okay, that's interesting. Plamen had a long match with Chersky and then he gave him... Plamen was not lucky. Okay, I need to watch that, yeah. I only remember... Maybe I'm mistaken, but... Yeah, I don't know. Exactly two years ago, yeah. We need to check the videos again. So then let's go to Ongarbaev versus...
SPEAKER_03: Todd Hutchings, this is a great match. Yeah, so I think I will stay with Ongarbaev. I think yes, because he can do many techniques and Todd Hutchings looks like he has only sideways. So I think the power of sideways of Ongarbaev could be similar to Todd.
SPEAKER_03: But both have so much endurance and both are very great pullers. But I think Orga and Baev will win this. He will have more endurance, maybe even. And he can finish all different styles, like even press, whatever. I think I will stay winning for Orga and Baev. Okay. Kamil is thinking Orga and Baev is going to win. And let's see what Ivan says.
SPEAKER_00: I think that Ongarbaev is a little favorite. Perhaps most obviously, he will take Todd's wrist. And in this case, Todd's advantage in side pressure will not be so big in this case. And in this case, maybe Ongarbaev will be stronger, yes.
SPEAKER_00: But we know that Todd lately uses a little new technique, high side pressure, yes, with pronation. And maybe this will help him. But with the dead wrist, I see now, with this position, I do not see him winning.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, no, he's winning like this, but if he is like this, he cannot. But once he has the pronator, he's like, Irakli took his wrist, but with this, from here, he pressed, he also took Irakli's wrist, you know. John took his wrist, he also took John's wrist, because they tried to get away instead of trying to control his pronator.
SPEAKER_04: more they do like this it's better for him he's just he's in like a train that way but whenever he put prudnik prudnik at the full wrist control you know and then that that really enabled him you know but i would say 50 50 awesome you think yes because sometimes he's that side pressure is just like
SPEAKER_04: like not from this earth, not from this planet, that side pressure sometimes can allow, like can enable you applying something, you know, because you to apply something, you need to keep your hand in front of your shoulder. Once your hand is moving that way, then like, it is very, very hard to, and he can stay here like forever, like in this position. But if somebody can survive from there, that's Ungar Bey, because he can also do miraculously, you know, like,
SPEAKER_04: incredible technique you know you versus on that way would be very very interesting yeah because like can he top roll you very hard and then once he goes inside then who knows what's gonna happen there because i think he can also pull inside i think that maybe i'm a little favorite if i'm 115
SPEAKER_00: but if you if you make me cut to 100.5 107 maybe it will be much more difficult yes yeah and in this case yeah so you are saying that in 150 you are you have the edge in 105 he has the edge um it will be very difficult yes for me in 105 yes i'm less stronger yeah but you know he is also he can also reach 110 kilo
SPEAKER_04: Easily. A few times before we came here, I asked Mazgan Shamiev. His weight is 110 kilos, so he's able to reach that weight. And yeah, so let's see. Let's see how it will be. An incredible match. And John Berzinger to Sasho. Kamil. I think more favorite in this one is John Brzenk because he's just basically bigger. His hand is bigger.
SPEAKER_03: and could be a little bit difficult for Sasho to hook him easy. And that's what I saw with John Prang and Vojvoda. It shocked me. So I think John Prang is really great form, but I don't know how much he has damage after that match. So if he will recover everything and be the same power, same strong, I think John Prang will win this one. Yeah, it was seven weeks and John
SPEAKER_00: never was in like terrible position yeah he never was in losing position yeah so maybe he don't have any damage yeah i think he is he's fine you know i i yeah and and how do you see d1 the same maybe uh 60 to 40 john do you see john tableau in such resist yes yes i think it will be i think it will it may be something close to
SPEAKER_04: so yes i think that um you know i mean i can see him like this but totally topple in his wrist like this i i just it's very like not that easy for me to because he he really supinates and then and then he hits your pronator there's the sideway um
SPEAKER_04: Trying to top roll him, I don't know. I think for John, the best way is not top roll, not hook, but just hang on pronator and go over Sasho's pronator that way. You know, more like the way that those two rounds that he won against Zurab, that he went like, he held him even low and then without strap, he just went over his pronator, made his palm go up like this. But it's interesting. So you are thinking that John is going to top roll him.
SPEAKER_04: something like you do maybe oh so not exactly taking the risk but just enabling his wrist and then moving on his product oh okay yeah okay i understand and listen yeah let's see and then you are saying that john uh sasho doesn't have uh a big winning chance
SPEAKER_00: He's in different shapes. I think he was not in so good shape against Ongarbaev, I think. But he was very good against Alexey. His hand was very big, very impressive. If you saw his pictures, his hand was very big. Well, it depends on his shape. If he's good against Alexey, I think that Sasho has little chances. But if he's not, who knows?
SPEAKER_04: I understand. And then let's go to the main event. Denis Sipenko versus Devon Larratt. Devon Larratt. Yeah, I asked Devon how to pronounce his last name. He said, same as like carrots, you know, vegetable carrots. He said, Larratt. This is what he told me. So Devon Larratt versus Denis Sipenko. Let's go, Kamil. Yeah, I think...
SPEAKER_03: I think I really like this match and I'll enjoy to watch, but it's a little bit funny because this time I don't see Devon too much trash talk on Denis on YouTube, so I'm not sure why, but I think I stay with Devon. He improved so much last year or even maybe two. He improved so much. He's very strong every technique. He's very strong inside. He's very strong outside.
SPEAKER_03: He don't losing his wrist. So, you know, we don't see too much siplenkov. He just pulling same way with everyone with already bent wrist pulling inside. So it's really hard to say what can happen from ready go position when he has to be straight with the wrist. And I think Devon will win this one.
SPEAKER_03: And I think it will be hard for him to finish because the biggest power Cyplenkov have with that open, but I think Devon will find a way to finish him. Probably it will end up with the shoulder press, but something like that. I think it will be like 60 to 40. Of course,
SPEAKER_00: Cyplenkov have some chance to win it. I don't say he have zero, but I think win is for Devon Larratt. And Ivan? I think that it will be a close match. Devon has improved much lately. He has become bigger, stronger.
SPEAKER_00: and dennis is not so perhaps so big as he used to be and maybe not so strong according to his weights ways he did and it is they are different it is a different devon and different dennis dennis is also not like he was judging from those spoon he has in his gym and he's pulling against john
SPEAKER_00: Because if we match Denis 10 years ago, if Denis 10 years ago pulls Devon now, I think that Denis would win with shoulder press, maybe. But now I haven't seen this move from Denis for several years. Shoulder press, you said? I mean the triceps move.
SPEAKER_00: because uh it was not his main style main style was like more like you know yes yes but yes but he had this um move also you mean that devon would do this and then he would just press him like this yes i think that he couldn't cop dennis couldn't copy him i'm not sure maybe but i'm not sure yes i think that he would just uh
SPEAKER_00: push him yes with triceps and something like um maybe he would manage he would have the uh the chance to do it uh just to hold maybe and from that position go now i'm not sure that dennis has this move on the other hand i see that dennis has become uh has got more endurance than he used to have um so i think it will be a long
SPEAKER_04: a long war i hope so what i realized you go ahead sorry about it i thought you finished go ahead i think it would be 50 50 as well like whenever i watch his training videos like i see that dennis lost a lot of this
SPEAKER_04: But even against Dadikyan, he doesn't really have the center and the wrist. And he cannot really, like, you remember, he was holding the guys and being like this, like a tight way.
SPEAKER_04: Now I don't see he has this, he doesn't have side pressure. He goes here and then he pronates out with Tom. Yeah, it's great, but like his dominance over opponent's pronator is much less as a wrist, as a side pressure is much, but his here is for sure stronger, but he's holding so low.
SPEAKER_04: and then so it may be disadvantage you know if Devon just like high hooks over his you understand over his he may not be able to get out because Devon's reach is also very you know long you know he can so Devon will be using his wrists very effectively and since Devon's most powerful part is his pronators and Denis is having a hard time to control
SPEAKER_04: Davit Dadikian's pronator and side pressure. So it looks like Denis's only way out is his pronator. And then with that tall forearm and the high hook, I mean, whatever I see till now at the table, training of Denis still didn't convince me. But we still have one month, you know. We still have one month. And I'm sure that when Denis is training with Dadikian, Dadikian is much more rested.
SPEAKER_04: the weight lifting and everything you know so maybe if we just rest like a week or something we will see something um difference but i don't know i don't know like i don't do predictions um about the matches i said but all i say that i think um dennis needs to still improve a little bit more it's my opinion just
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. Do you agree? Do you disagree? What do you think about this? I agree with everything you said. With everything you said. And I think that Denis, after watching Devon against Kvikvinia, I remember that I knew how Denis could beat Devon. But I'm not sure that he's able to do it now in this way.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yes oh okay i understand what yours and i think devon is not gonna go there i think devon is not gonna do something like this i think devon is gonna protect the center if you realize that last a few super matches devon is really protecting the center he's not really opening like this anymore but like against even just remember round one the first start against kennedy
SPEAKER_04: and also started with the sundries match and last air mass match so the guy is more strong right here instead of pulling himself and elbow and everything he's already here started to uh dominate so the the problem is that dennis has too much of low grip whenever you have that much of low grip you are allowing your opponent to
SPEAKER_04: do this you know or that this is how daddy can start if you realize that that he can just start like this and he already has come and then what dennis is just dennis is going here and then his pronator is incredible so also the left if you realize that he's just pulling like tractor you know just like and then from there he's getting else but the another thing is he has incredible endurance dennis has incredible endurance that one also has incredible endurance so
SPEAKER_04: I don't know what will happen. There was a super chat. I would like to read that. And then Rick Harrow, thank you for your super chat. You guys speak English very well.
SPEAKER_04: that is awesome thank you very much for your compliments uh those two guys are speaking very well mine is still trying to improve but um so i think that's all only only probably four weeks a little bit more than four weeks we will meet and then we will hopefully enjoy we will have good time and then for
SPEAKER_04: few hours we will forget about having fun and then we will all become warriors after the match finish we will again hug each other and have fun and then go home as usual thank you very much ivan for coming a legend of our sports and kami rising stars thank you for being my guest thank you very much yeah and then i am honored that you guys are um
SPEAKER_04: being my guest at the event and pulling and once again thank you very much to also everyone who has been uh watching us any any last word you guys would like to add before we finish i would just say uh stay strong like coach ray love our wrestling and stay strong okay and you even
SPEAKER_00: I'd like to say good luck to you in your preparation to be healthy, to prepare well. I'm looking forward to your match. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you, Ivan. Thank you. It means a lot. Okay, guys. Take care and have a good one. See you soon. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
