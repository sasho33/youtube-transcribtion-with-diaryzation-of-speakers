SPEAKER_03: So. which.
SPEAKER_03: Hello guys. Hello to Khrushchev. Okay, this is Paolo, he's here.
SPEAKER_04: How are you, Engin? Good, good. Good to see you again. Good to see you too. Good to see your positive self again. Yes. Good to see you too, Engin. How are you? Tired, as always. Sure. I'm sure. You're working hard. You're working harder than any of the athletes to prepare for the match. We haven't seen that, like,
SPEAKER_04: Like there is a, how do you call it? Like there is a, you dig a hole, right? And then you have a camel. Either you're gonna make the camel jump there or there, or you're gonna live here. It means that if you are doing something, either you're gonna do it without complaining, you know?
SPEAKER_04: or you are just gonna shut up and leave it to someone who can do better you know so no complaining but yeah but tired yeah yeah how is uh how is your training going today i train like it was good yeah like i'm for many years i couldn't do dumbbell hammer curse on a scott it was bench it was hurting here
SPEAKER_04: And then I started slowly. So I started with eight kilos, 10 kilos with a thick bar. You understand? It hurts me here. And so today I went up to 22 kilos. It is not that how many kilos I lift, but I see the progress because if it doesn't hurt me, if I can continue every training, I increase two kilos.
SPEAKER_04: And then whenever I reach to 30, 40 kilo, because I train very correct, like some people goes like this, while mine is just like, you know, forearm, you know, and yeah. So what I just say important for me is
SPEAKER_04: to be healthy and being able to train because I know that power is there once I can train. And then I did some wrist training as well. Everything is good. Everything is good. It's good to hear that you're forward, progress. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what matters. Once you put that on the path, you need to be careful because
SPEAKER_04: stronger you get the risk is bigger because the pressure is getting heavier and heavier so maybe I need to sometimes get rest like make the rest in days a little bit sometimes longer sometimes I need to hit some lighter training sessions you know just to make sure that I don't push it all the time yeah yeah no absolutely you cannot push it for 30 years straight yeah we need some rest that's for
SPEAKER_04: Let's see. Let's see how it will be. I cannot wait. The next event, it will be very good. Arsene Lille will be our special guest. Levan is coming. Levan is coming as a special guest as well. It will be good. Yeah, it will be good. The event is... And then this month we have incredible event, just like Alexey Voivodo is just coming back. Let's see where he is at.
SPEAKER_04: um it's exciting because the guy from what i see from what i see training wise uh alexei is in a better shape than i thought he is yeah he is and he's not that heavy he's a lot of time i i was told he was 112 kilo
SPEAKER_04: like the years ago that 20 124 kilo he was when he won the zoological but the guy is just as i always say he's created to be an athlete you know the guy is just he could do many other things as well you know he has done with bob slade oh yeah absolutely he's he's very gifted and very athletic yeah very well very well trained as a base absolutely yeah yeah yeah yeah but by the way he's the same age as me we are the same year
SPEAKER_04: The only thing is that, like, I am not sure how he will handle the pressure mentally. Because many years you are away, people said, oh, he put president was six years ago. And also it was after 10 years. And then, so it is not that easy, you understand? Just to come and suddenly have that...
SPEAKER_04: yeah that the strong psychology is not that easy and I think mentally John will be more prepared but uh let's see physically where the match is I don't think John is in bad shape I saw where John stopped uh Hutchings you know like it was just like I mean not many people can handle that pressure that long you know when when oh yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: no i don't think that john bad shape first of all john never in a bad shape i mean he's always good or better but uh for voyevoda it needs to it needs some special attention for sure yeah yeah yeah but the thing is that like uh todd is sometimes putting you in a like a bad position and then like his race is like this
SPEAKER_04: you cannot so you really need to have the full control i mean if if somehow john ends up with the same position with alexi i don't think that alexi would have the same that that like raw you know side pressure you understand but alexi is probably more controlled more controlling biceps yeah yeah wrist everything controlled but then then he will be playing the the chess game
SPEAKER_00: with john which john also is very good so um so we will see for me is a big question mark um we will see it's going to be very interesting very interesting for sure yeah yeah yeah other matches as well you know oh yeah this uh uh this versus west x 10 is uh something else it's uh it's it's yeah the card is incredible
SPEAKER_04: It's not totally announced yet, all of them. Yeah, yeah. But for whatever you announced already is very good. It's very, very good. Yeah, I just like I sometimes think that, you know, like, will I be able to cover the event? And I was like, who cares? And like, who cares? Just forget about it. Just just write the history. You lose, you lose, you know, just just just do it, you know, just do it. I mean,
SPEAKER_00: We can't be all the time being so careful, you understand? I don't think I have ever been careful. I always push the limits, as you can see. Yeah, me too. Same here, always to the limit. I don't know if it's a good one, but for what you're doing, it's definitely good for us to watch it from the side. I don't know if it's good for you, but it's definitely good for us.
SPEAKER_04: I also care to cover the event as well, of course, because that way I can serve more. I can do something bigger. I cannot be like only like, you know, just like, like, okay, like if I don't, if I don't continue, then it's the bad thing. You will see. That's for sure. That is for sure.
SPEAKER_00: this king of the table will be very interesting to watch for me at least i don't know if it's uh that interesting interesting for uh you know non-arm wrestlers fans but uh for arm wrestlers it's going to be very interesting it is this is all those are very close matchups in my right very close matchups yeah hello bob ken hello dennis
SPEAKER_03: uh hello hello hello hello
SPEAKER_04: Hello, Denis. Hello, hello. Look at their voice. It's just like V-12 engine. You know that it belongs to someone really strong. Yep. Yep. So how is everything?
SPEAKER_01: So, how is everything going, Denis? Training going good? How is everything going, they ask. How is everything going, they ask. How is the training? After long shifts, finally, the first training at home. And now I will train at home for two months.
SPEAKER_01: It's okay. I'm happy with the result. I did some weights. It's a good start.
SPEAKER_00: Denis said after long travels, finally he did the first training at home and now he will stay for two months at home and will be training at home. He sounds very happy about it and he said that he's very happy with the results of this training and he did some weights and he's happy about them. He's happy? Okay, that's good. That's good, that's good. And Babken, did you guys train today?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, of course, we just finished. Guys are waiting for us. Valera, who is he? Who is he? Uncle Valera.
SPEAKER_01: in internet like his name yeah yeah that's good that's good how did you feel dennis how was your shape like
SPEAKER_00: he said he said that everything is fine except that he was traveling a lot and he still have a jet lag uh time change so he's uh going to bed too early and waking up too early so need some adjustment on uh timing uh otherwise everything is good
SPEAKER_00: i'm happy to see you with your good english thank you thank you now your english is very good too but uh yeah i will uh i will try to be translated so you can enjoy
SPEAKER_00: Top role is for smarts. As a super chat, he is asking how much Denis' biceps grow in the last year. It seems bigger. Denis, someone wrote a super chat asking you how much your biceps have grown in the last year. It looks very big. It's just that it's swollen after training. The weight is the same. The biceps haven't been measured for a long time, because it's still 140 kilograms.
SPEAKER_00: okay then he's saying that it's uh swollen after a workout uh and he said the way his body weight stays the same and until he will reach 140 kilos uh uh mark there is no uh absolute no sense to make measurements of the biceps okay what's his rate did you say his rate
SPEAKER_01: Denis, how much do you weigh now? 126 kilos. 126 kilos. So he didn't gain so much weight. Huh? He didn't gain so much weight. One period he gained and after he lost. He lost a lot of weight. Now the most interesting part of today will begin. On Monday.
SPEAKER_00: okay he said he says yeah because of all the travel traveling he lost a lot of weight you know and now he gained it back and he said that everything the most interesting will start from monday on monday he will start seriously yes after monday devon is in trouble
SPEAKER_01: he said that yeah now he will use to regime again because before that
SPEAKER_04: with the traveling it was you know unstable somehow somewhere whatever but now training will be by plan and stable and yeah now we'll be against gains i understand greg brown tv engine hiring are you hiring irene what my friends um julio martinez will dennis pull more often per year or he will require six months for each superman cheers thank you for your support
SPEAKER_00: Is he going to be pulling more often or like he will continue every six months, like they are asking? Denis asks in the Super Chat, will you be able to fight more often in a year or will you also be able to fight once every six months? Well, damn, we'll see. Now, what form I will gain, I will probably start from this. Everything will depend, probably, on the fight with Deva.
SPEAKER_00: okay then he's saying that uh it's very much depends on uh his uh uh form and performance uh with a super match with Devon and uh after a super match with Devon he will make some decisions and adjustments if necessary it's very much depends on how he will gain the form I understand
SPEAKER_04: So his weight is 126, and then from Monday, he will start serious preparation, and then we will see how it will go. And I want to ask you also as to Bakken as well. Bakken, what do you think about the upcoming
SPEAKER_04: Alexey Voivodo versus John Brzing match. What are the advantages of the athletes? What are the disadvantages of the athletes?
SPEAKER_02: Of course important which weight Alexei in training time what we have is what we see it's very higher high level weight lifting what he do. Depending this weight it's important to bring on the table.
SPEAKER_02: If he will bring, of course, it will be very dangerous for John. So you are saying that his weight in the gym is very, very high. Yes, very high. But do you think that there is also a disadvantage of not being active for many years? Psychologically, it is also not that easy, right? Yes, of course. This is a very important point to...
SPEAKER_02: uh bring your you know confident uh psychology mind from you know from past because now he he have many thing to do he have many job mp he lose uh maybe this no fire from his you know from heart from like what we have before this is of course very important
SPEAKER_04: yeah shine up isaka why asking babka in question about this i can ask whatever i want to whoever i want i mean if you're gonna watch this respectfully watch it continue like this you get blocked you can go cry somewhere else you can join to those desperate housewives you know gossip girls you know club you know okay now for now shut up anyways um and i want to ask the same question to dennis
SPEAKER_01: Denis, what do you think about Alexey vs. John match? Denis, what do you think about Alexey vs. John match? Well, I've already told you that Alexey is well prepared in terms of working weights. Everything will be decided on the spot, how he will spend the match.
SPEAKER_01: Let's say, psychologically, how he will approach this question. Probably, it depends most on this. And so, I think, he has enough strength to beat John.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, Denis is saying that he already answered that question before, but one more time. He said that Alexey is ready by the lifting weights and the physical preparation, but it will be mostly depends on his psychological readiness, how he will spend the night before and if he will prepare himself
SPEAKER_02: his psyche be ready for this match but physically he said that uh alexis is ready to be john mike dubin thank you my friends for your support yeah this is exactly what i also think i'm 100 sure yes one second i want to answer about this uh dirty guys who didn't even understand many things because uh
SPEAKER_02: Alexei, I know from 2000, more than 20 years. And we are friends and our responsibility to representing him in the bring back in the big sport. And we together, we want to do for fans our wrestling. You don't need to explain anything, my friend.
SPEAKER_02: If I brought you here, if I invited you here as a guest, I can ask you whatever I want. Many people, they didn't know who I am, and that's why...
SPEAKER_02: it's very you know it's a face-to-face uh it's better to talk about like these things about you or to me it's negative moment i don't like that yeah yeah and and and dennis uh my friends uh i i kind of see that finally the things a little bit
SPEAKER_04: calm down between you and Devon. And it looks like you both focus on the competition, the table. And are you happy about this? Because his last response to you was also calm, but he's thinking that you are risking your health, sacrificing. And also, do you agree about that claim?
SPEAKER_00: The question is very complex. He says that recently,
SPEAKER_00: such a verbal confrontation between you and Devon has calmed down a little. His last statement was that you sacrifice your health during training and that he wishes you good health. Does this calm you down more or less? And what do you think about this, about sacrificing your health?
SPEAKER_01: I've always been very quiet. I didn't pay attention to his falls, to be honest. I've gone through a lot in this life. So, to put it simply, I don't react to it, I don't spend energy on it. As for health, well, it's clear that professional sports are about health.
SPEAKER_01: It's unhealthy. Yes, I was on vacation for four years. After the operation, they offered me, I understood that I had to start slowly, and then we'll see. Of course, we look after the guys who are injured one by one. No one insured anything. But that's my fate, that's my life. I want to fight. We are at a certain risk.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, and Denis is answering to Devon that, you know, it's always been calm in my head and it doesn't matter, whatever he is, you know, working with his tongue, it doesn't really bother Denis because he already passed through a lot in his life and he's confident enough not to react to all of this stuff.
SPEAKER_00: Regarding his sacrificing his health, he said, listen, any professional sport is risky to anybody's health. And yes, we are taking the risks. And yes, he knows about risks. And after the surgery, for four years, he's been out and he's been relaxing, retired.
SPEAKER_00: but now he got this you know proposal and he's trying very carefully to do his comeback and he will see how it goes and he understands the risks like probably everybody else yeah and how is he now is he is in good health good uh
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Denis is saying that everything is fine as of right now. About a month ago, he did all the all necessary, you know, blood work and stuff and yeah, everything looks fine. That's why he started preparation.
SPEAKER_04: That's good. I'm happy for him. Denis is one of the nicest guys in the community that I ever met him. Matthew Day. This is one second. Maybe I should wait for the question. Can you read the question? I don't know. Somehow my computer is getting small screen.
SPEAKER_04: Davit want to say hello for you. I love you. I love you. One hand. Okay. This is a proper fans match. Can't wait to watch. Good luck to watch. I'm a Devon fan, but follow Denis as well. Thank you for putting on the best shows.
SPEAKER_04: Thank you, Matthew Day. Thank you, my friend. Thank you for being a great fan. Abdulmanaf Al-Ghamis, thank you for your support, my friend. Thank you. We checked today, Davit's right hand. All his left hand power going to right.
SPEAKER_04: Wow, so he's now a stronger right arm. Yeah, yeah, really. Wow, wow, yeah, yeah. He looked, after the first start of the first round, after that, he looked very dominant, yeah. And I was surprised that I was thinking that after that long war with Frutnik, I thought that he lost energy and also his psychology would be down, but he was still very strong, still was very strong, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: We have some secret, simple secret I'll bring back. I'll tell you after what we do. Okay. And Denis, what did you think about the last... Bye and get it. I want to say bye.
SPEAKER_04: Last event, East vs. West. What did you think about, like, first of all, start from LaLite vs. Revas match? What do you think, Denis, from the last East vs. West? Well, he's going to name a couple of matches now, but the first one he'd like to hear is Revas vs. LaLite.
SPEAKER_01: Well, as I said, it will be difficult. It was clear from the first round that everything was right on the edge. They fought for the middle for a long time. But Vitalich turned out to be a winner. Well, I said that 60% of what I bet on Vitalich. At first, he justified my hopes. But it was interesting, yes. The fight was equal, more or less.
SPEAKER_00: Denis saying that, yeah, that was a very good match. And he said, as I said, it was very, very close. And on the very beginning, there was a very serious fight for the center of the table. But as Denis predicted, Denis was, I'm sorry, Vitaly Lalitin was about 60% dominance and he has better endurance.
SPEAKER_00: and took the match and took the match so what he said yeah very excitement very excited match yeah and what did he think about hermes versus devon match i'm very curious about his opinion about this match
SPEAKER_01: According to his scenario, we had to make Hermes nervous, load him up, beat him up. Well, he did it. And then we saw it for ourselves. That is, it was all the same, let's say...
SPEAKER_00: uh dennis says yeah larat created a perfect scenario uh for to beat um
SPEAKER_00: gladiator and uh uh he played that scenario very well and uh he pushed it through and uh mind game was you know was there uh he make uh hermes nervous and that's how it started and then he loaded him up uh bloated him to make sure that his arms start bloating and then he took the match you know and that's approximately what they thought is gonna happen and it's happened
SPEAKER_04: okay so did he not think that like like devon was better than hermes do you think that he was only because of this or he also thinks that devon is also strong
SPEAKER_00: He asks, don't you think that Larratt was better than Hermes? Do you think that only such tricks, tricks, tricks and mind games... Well, damn, he turned Hermes off with his finger and then did his thing. Well, damn, it's obvious to everyone. Of course, I would just like to take it and fight.
SPEAKER_01: In my opinion, it's not beautiful. I don't know if the audience doesn't understand this, but as a professional and a specialist, of course, I wouldn't want it that way. I would probably put it out for some time at once, such a little thing and that's it, no problem.
SPEAKER_01: as it is usually done. It allows a lot of personal movements. For me, this is unacceptable. That's all.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so it's a little complicated answer. He said, yes, he took Hermes' wrist and fingers on one side, but on another side, those mind games and those games for the setup on the table, he said, for me personally, it's not really acceptable. And he said, I'm not sure how it looks like for...
SPEAKER_00: our you know funds non-arm wrestling funds or beginner arm wrestlers funds but for me as a professional uh it's not acceptable he said uh if if it's up to me not up to show it's very possible that i would just uh give him a fall if he will start unfaithfully playing at the table and then we'll go on okay and does he mean does he mean
SPEAKER_00: Loading doesn't mean talking. Do you mean more talking, or is it more about capturing what he's talking about and loading it? Of course, it's about capturing. You can ignore talking. Of course, it's about capturing everything. Physical pressure. Physical.
SPEAKER_00: yeah then he says that uh you know he's uh uh talking and talking uh in general it's tolerable and it's you know it's it's whatever we can tolerate that but uh that physical input what he's doing coming table jerking and stuff he said that's this is not acceptable we have to you know fight for grip grip up and arm wrestling
SPEAKER_04: so for him so for he okay what exactly was it was the jerking or was he he's talking about the webbing or he talks about the center pulling from the center what exactly what exactly okay i i will ask he said any physical input but i will ask exactly about yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: Denis, what exactly do you mean? Do you mean that he manipulated with a brush? Well, you can see that the armistice is already in place, the judge has already put it out, and then, for example, Laurent Hoppe lets go of his hand, you know.
SPEAKER_01: take over, take over, take over, take over, take over, take over, take over, take over, take over, take over, take over, take over,
SPEAKER_00: yeah then he's saying that it's it's all together basically but uh what's the most frustrating uh that basically the grip is ready and the referee is ready to say go and exactly at that moment when hermes already have his grip and lara too the the both athletes having their grip and it looks okay and right before uh
SPEAKER_00: ref says go larat will take the hand out or start moving or to to re-grip you know and this is he's saying that he's starting early is what he's saying or no no he started to taking hand out right before you know it's it's already ready and hermes already set and you know loaded and everything is ready to go and at that exact moment when everybody expect the goal larat take his hand off or start moving or re-gripping
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I understand. Anyway, so I understand his concern, yeah. So he also has the same concern about his own match? He said, yeah, I think it's going to be approximately the same.
SPEAKER_01: Even in the match in 2018 on the left hand, the same thing happened. He said in the interview that he tried in every way to load me, but I did not lead to it. This is his interview and it was so.
SPEAKER_00: Nothing has changed since then. That's how it will be. Yes, that's his style.
SPEAKER_00: re-grip grip and you know cheat cheat or uh adjust his uh his style before the goal uh so he he you know he admitted stable master double master
SPEAKER_04: And another question for him. There is super chat. Abdulmanaf, thank you for your super chat. How much stronger Denis, okay, how much, not stronger, but how much his power right now compared to his prime?
SPEAKER_01: In terms of energy, what percentage of your power do you have? Well, let's put it this way. I haven't even got the form I need for John yet. I think I'll be able to talk about it in a month. I'm planning to get on the scales.
SPEAKER_00: Denis says it's a little bit too early to talk right now about power comparison, but we will talk in a month. In a month, he's planning to be approximately at the level when he beat John.
SPEAKER_04: And then after that, he will see how it goes for another month, how much he can progress for them. That's interesting. I thought he was already at that shape. He said not yet. Oh, it's interesting because Bob can personally told me that. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so Jeremy Coleman, what does Denis think that Hermes lifting his elbow several times in referee's grip? Which round was it?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. I don't know. I didn't really see that. I mean, I saw that. Does Hermes' lifting have anything to do with Devon also passing the center to his side as well? Can you ask him that? Do you think that Hermes lifted his elbow because Devon tried to pull the center to himself? Maybe it's related to that.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it's not even about that. It's about the fact that all these manipulations are done by Larratt. It doesn't matter what Hermes did. Did he lift or not? The fact that he lifted was a minus for him. I'm not sure, I don't think he did it on purpose.
SPEAKER_01: When Hermes tried to put, all the time he was pushing up Devon. He pushed up.
SPEAKER_00: So yeah, Denis and Babkin thinking that every time any manipulation was in favor of Devon, and Devon was basically provocating Hermes to do so, every time, you know, Hermes tried to set his elbow down on a pedal and push Devon down, Devon would push back and, you know, and lift him up again.
SPEAKER_00: pulling up and lifting his elbow again and you know it was they they think it was uh basically provocating from devon because his anthropometria is different he's a longer descent devon and hermes is a little shorter and that's why it's not comfortable he may up up up um tony tony tom listen
SPEAKER_04: Thank you for your super chat. Sorry if I pronounce your last name wrong. Great to finally take part in your podcast. You are doing great things again. Hope to partake soon. Thank you. Thank you very much, my friend. Yeah, that is a question that I want him to answer clearly.
SPEAKER_00: How much does he think his chances against them are? He's asking for a clear answer. I'll translate it for everyone else. What are your chances with Larratt in the fight? I'm going to win. That's it. I'm going to do everything to win. What chances? To say that I don't know is stupid.
SPEAKER_04: Denis said that the answer, I don't know, will not be a proper one. He said that I am ready to win. He is ready to win. Okay. So he is coming there with fully focused for winning. Yes. This guy, Paolo, I don't know if you ever met him in person, but the guy is just like...
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I can say that one of the least fake person that like has fake ties, you understand? Like, I mean, I'm not saying that other people fake or something, but this guy is just like 100% himself. He doesn't give a shit. He doesn't play games. Whatever he thinks, he says. That's exactly why everybody loves Denis, right?
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah straightforward he said that he doesn't see many obstacles and he didn't see nothing yeah so he will not be he will not be intimidated by devon's mind games
SPEAKER_00: I'm not intimidated. He said, no, I'm not intimidated at all. And he said that, yeah, I will get up to the table and I will fight with everything I have. I'm sure that Devon also will fight and we will see a war there. We will see a war there, I have no doubt. And another question, does he like the belt?
SPEAKER_00: He said, I don't have anything like that. Very motivated to get one. Does he feel like he will have one soon or not?
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that for devil it's a little too big.
SPEAKER_04: It's too big for him. Yeah, for Devon, yes. That's fun. That's good. That's good. I like it. It's non-toxic, you know, non-toxic, toxic trash talk. Maybe not trash talk. We shouldn't even say that, but it's interesting. Normally, this was going to be a match between Devon and Denis. Nothing about title. But suddenly, Gennady got injured.
SPEAKER_04: And then Morozov got some problems. And suddenly, Hermes, who is the champion, had to pull. Not had to, but Devon offered and he said, I'm ready. They pull. And suddenly, like nobody was expecting, Devon became the super heavyweight champion because Levan also, I mean, for East versus West, yeah, Levan couldn't be because Levan never pulled here. But he was going to pull for the...
SPEAKER_04: uh he was gonna pull for uh he was gonna put morozov and he hurt his wrist so he is now out of the rankings so that one is now number one like did the meaning meaning of the match change after it became the like for east versus west world champion title match did like did it become even a little bit more important okay let me let me translate everything
SPEAKER_00: It so happened that now Larratt is a champion in superweight. And it so happened that now, when you're going to fight him,
SPEAKER_00: you will fight for the title of world champion according to this version, because Levan has never fought yet, plus his injury in East vs West, he did not fight, plus the injury. Kvikvinia is the same, a little on the side, Morozova has a stomach problem, and so it turned out that
SPEAKER_00: you will fight with larat for the championship title or did it change your attitude to the match and did it add some kind of pepper to your attitude to this event, so now you told me to add pepper, I understood, I didn't think about it, to be honest, in any case, there are still strong guys there, but nevertheless, I
SPEAKER_00: Denis says that he did not think about it before but now when I said that and when you said that it's you know spiced up things and he's even more motivated now and uh yeah he will he will be more motivated from now on wow so we will we will see 100
SPEAKER_04: motivated dennis siplenko and i know that devon is also 100 motivated and i just think that it will be incredible match and cause cause the oreo thank you for your super chat levan didn't say anything about the setup with devon is dennis already making excuses like levan didn't have any problems with devon's you know setup
SPEAKER_04: and he's saying that why dennis is like already making excuses they are asking you know
SPEAKER_00: Someone wrote a superchat with a question like this. Levan didn't complain about the setup, about the starting position with Larratt. He said he didn't have any problems. Well, you're talking about it, you're already coming up with some excuses. I don't know. Levan just kept quiet. Levan just kept quiet about it.
SPEAKER_00: From respect, okay. Artem you comparing Hermes and Levan now? No, no. When Levan was fighting with Larratt. Hermes? I don't understand.
SPEAKER_00: No, no. When Levan was fighting with Larratt, he didn't complain about the capture. He didn't say anything about the capture. He just said, like, you're not talking well, and about the capture himself, he didn't complain. They say, why are you talking about it, Denis?
SPEAKER_01: I mean, you started with Gasparin. I told him that he works with his fingers and his tits, trying to destroy them. You just answered the question. And he will do the same for me. It is clear that in Lebanon, in comparison with Gasparin, it is much larger, and it may be inconvenient to do in any case. But in my case, it will probably be inconvenient for him too.
SPEAKER_01: But nevertheless, he will do it. I'm not saying that there will be problems or not problems, how I will react to them. But the point is that we are professionals, we fight and train. And I roughly understand how to react to such things and what happens if you finish it to the end, right?
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so basically the answer was like this.
SPEAKER_00: Denis started talking about this, not because he's making any excuses, but because there was a question from you, Engin, what he thinks about this. And Denis just said what he thinks about this. But he's not afraid of this setup issues or whatever. Devon will not make any complications or issues to Denis. He doesn't care. He just analyze and answer your question, basically.
SPEAKER_04: yeah but did you tell him that this is a super chat like yes yes yes yes absolutely yeah yeah yeah he knows okay i told him okay okay and what what did what did bob can say about about levan or something he was just saying
SPEAKER_04: yeah he's he said that uh levan just did not commented because it was not worse of uh commentary you know and uh this is just in the basic level beating so easy that you need to talk about it okay i don't think will dennis prepare with zaur bloodletting thanks they say like will he will he be doing training with the other top production coolers
SPEAKER_00: Denis, someone from Superchat is asking, will you be sparring with Laletin and Zaur in your preparation? Well, I don't know. If there is an opportunity, well, again, not this month, next month.
SPEAKER_00: uh dennis says that uh as of right now there is no plan to do so but if it will be if there will be a possibility maybe next month they will think about it and there is logan
SPEAKER_00: Question for Denis. Denis, do you feel strong enough to go inside into a hook with Devon if the match was there?
SPEAKER_01: I don't even know how it will go. I will try to resist his technique, of course. And then we will twist and twist. We will, of course, try. I will not say anything about this. I'm not going to go in there on purpose, do something. I will just try to break the corners. This is the maximum that I will do. And how it will go there.
SPEAKER_00: so basically then it says uh yes if it goes that direction but i will not uh you know initiate that for sure i will uh i will try i will try to you know separate uh devon's angles yes but uh you know if if we will you know go if it will go into the hook then you know we will pull into the hooks i'm ready
SPEAKER_04: Erick Mursa Galiyev, Engin should not allow family members on stage. I know what you mean. I think you mean like Devon's family members, but that is not the only one that I
SPEAKER_04: allowed. There has been some other family members as well. Like last event, there was Ruslan Babaiev and his sister Sinezana Babaiev was there. I can show so many examples like this. I mean, the people has a right to take someone there and we cannot say that it can be a family member or not. Like Derek Smith
SPEAKER_04: Many times Dave Chaffee at his wife at the corner. So I don't know why it's just a deal as long as they stay distant, you know. Do you want me to translate this to Russian again?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you can, you can. I mean, I think that they are pointing only there once in a while, and there are some other people as well. I don't understand why, you know. There was a question from the Superchat. Well, it's not a question for you, it's just a question for Engin, that he should prohibit family members from being in the corner of the athlete. But Engin answered, he says, well, I don't understand why I should do that if...
SPEAKER_00: It doesn't matter if it's a wife or a brother or a sister, because Babaiev had a sister, Chafe sometimes had a wife. He says, I don't see any problems with that. If they behave normally and take their position, what difference does it make if they are members of a family or not? He says, I don't see any problems with that. It's nonsense.
SPEAKER_00: what did they say uh that it's a little bit kind of uh no i it just doesn't make sense this question it's just you know a little bit stupid because it it shouldn't be matter if they behave if they behave properly then should shouldn't should matter yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean this one you said what they said what dennis yes
SPEAKER_04: That's what Denis said. This is what Denis said. Okay. Yeah. He said that he doesn't care. Yeah. This question is a little stupid. He said that stupid doesn't make sense. Yes. I understand. Okay. I just tried to understand.
SPEAKER_04: Guys, like many of you guys, you know, you are just here sharing this excitement. Thank you very much for all your support. And anyway, so let's continue more. Denis, did you know that there are like these events, next event, there will be probably six or seven world title matches. Did you know that?
SPEAKER_00: No, he didn't know. He said, why six, five? No, no, no. What? He said, no, I didn't know. He said, why six, five?
SPEAKER_04: y65 no he said y6 okay i i didn't get it anyway so there will be many many many many world title matches this is what i mentioned yeah yeah anyways and another thing for for dennis what does like when i i
SPEAKER_04: don't know if he remembers or not but last time we came to istanbul we were having dinner we just a little bit grip up with him and then of course he was stronger he was just holding but every time we hold it he would he even felt stronger and then whenever i talked with babka and babka said that any dennis is weird he
SPEAKER_04: very quickly recover. And then his endurance is incredible. And right now, Denis is pulling against someone that is also incredible about the endurance. Can you ask Denis his objective opinion about what does he think about his endurance versus Devon's endurance?
SPEAKER_00: I think they are not here.
SPEAKER_04: yeah i i don't see them yeah something happened i think they are coming or not yeah yeah they are coming back yeah
SPEAKER_00: there was a misunderstanding with the last question when he says why six why not five do you think that he may be thinking that it's like
SPEAKER_04: title matches six rounds or something you think i don't want him to understand misunderstand it it's just five rounds not six because because whenever you say that this is like six matches and then and they said why six it should be five or something maybe he misunderstood it can we talk about round is in about uh matches uh title matches you mean why too much
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, because the event is just the level of the event is just because I want to make it like, okay, as long as he understood correctly, it's okay. I don't want him to think that, you know, just because right before his match, we made the rounds, you know, higher or something, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, you were asking about his endurance versus Devon's endurance, you know?
SPEAKER_00: that you recover very, very quickly. And that your endurance is also very high. And the question for you, Denis, is this. What do you think about your endurance and the endurance of Larratt? Because he is also known for his endurance. I know. I know that he is known.
SPEAKER_01: Denis says that he doesn't know how to estimate
SPEAKER_00: how different their endurances are then he said that he's training and he he have some moments he have to adjust and he's getting ready for this but he doesn't know any other uh any other method to test it besides the actual super match and actual table different what's that what's the pumpkin we will check in diff different angles
SPEAKER_04: Okay, how? On the table, in match time. Okay, okay, okay. And Roy Lewary, thank you for your super chat. Engin, X versus West X10 will be top level like always. Thank you. Can you ask Denis if he has intentions to fight Lewan in the future?
SPEAKER_04: And good luck with Devon. This guy wishes good luck to Denis for his match against Devon. And I'm also asking, does he have any plans for the future? I think he already answered the East versus West eight press conference, but we can ask him again.
SPEAKER_00: Someone asked a question from the internet, super chat. First of all, you were lucky in your upcoming fight with Larratt, Denis. And the question was, do you have such a desire and such plans to fight Levan in the future?
SPEAKER_01: It's strange, of course. In the very beginning, we talked about the fact that if the path to Lebanon lies, then it lies in John, Larratt, and Ivan. If everything goes well with Larratt, then I'm ready to get to Lebanon. We've talked about this many times. You can turn on old recordings, I've told you everything.
SPEAKER_00: yeah dennis said that we've been talking about this uh many times already and he said yes absolutely uh that uh road to levan uh is going through john larat and then uh levan and he said depends on how this supernatural goes absolutely next step is levan okay awesome when you pulled devon the last time left-handed
SPEAKER_04: Did you give him the last round? If yes, will you do the same this time? I think it was not last round. I think he beat him 6-0. And I think they pulled one for show. I think it was like a seventh round, which was as far as I remember. And I asked him, did he give him the one show pulling? Did he let him win? And then he says, will you do the same again if you win?
SPEAKER_00: Denis, the question was this. When you fought Larratt for the last time, did you give him the last round or did Engin say, no, he probably won 6-0, but they fought another round just for the show. And the question was, will you do it again this time? It turned out that in the sixth round he will lose by halal.
SPEAKER_01: And I say to the judges, like, why? Let's fight. Well, they supposedly set the seventh round to fight. And I thought that it was, like, the foul was canceled and we fought in the sixth round. And I, like, gave up. Then Igor Madurenko said that no, we counted 6-0, that we would fight further, and that's not all. That's it. And then, well,
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so the explanation was like this. Round number six, Devon lost on faults.
SPEAKER_00: He falls two times and then he says to the referees, don't give this fall, let's pull one more time. You know, I don't want to win on a false, let's arm wrestle. So, and they added the round, this round number seven, just for fun. But afterwards, they just give it to Devon, give it to Devon. Okay, this round number seven.
SPEAKER_00: But afterwards, Igor Mazurenko says, no, no, no. We place it 6-0 because you won 6-0. And round number seven was just for fun. About this time, he said, guys, we will see. There is no straight answer. But he said that the seven round, he lost intentionally? Yes. I specially re-asked. Yes, he did. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_04: Shane661, thank you for your support, my friend. And Sol Arun, thank you, my friend. Hello, Denis, Bob Kane, Pablo, and Engin Legends. If I may ask Denis this, how much in percentage in his current self compared to his top shape back a few years ago? We just answered that question one more time. Yeah, he said that right now is it the shape of the John match?
SPEAKER_00: and then he's he said that he will be he will be in a john shape match in about four weeks in a month and then he will gain more for devon he will have another month to gain more for devon but he cannot compare today's form because it doesn't make sense okay how about asking him this way in what like how close does he think he will be uh like compared to his prime you know
SPEAKER_00: Denis, the question was again the same percentage of your form to the old ones, but a little bit rephrased, because they already answered it. What do you think, in your opinion, to the moment of the fight with Larratt, if you compare the percentage of your form, what will it be compared to your best form in your life?
SPEAKER_01: I was planning to extend it to 1.5 years, to Lebanon. I understand that if it's to Larratt, I probably won't be able to do it anyway. We'll see. If we take 100%, then, roughly speaking, I'm planning to do 80-85% to Larratt. It also depends on the mass, then I'll weigh more.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think that I will gain weight to lift such weights. I don't know if it's enough to lift my weight. We'll see. But at least 85 is necessary to gain. That is, if I am 70 on John, roughly speaking, at 7%, then the value is 85. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so the answer was a little more complicated than only percentage. And then he says, okay, so at the John, I was approximately at 70% to best form of my life, 200%. Then he said that there is not enough time to be very high, but most likely, and the goal is to gain 85% for a match with Larratt.
SPEAKER_00: and he said that the goal was to gain maximum for levan but then it's not sure how it will go because he will at that time to lift heavier weights and he is not sure if he will be able to gain that mess again if it's necessary at all so he will make adjustments after match with devon but for devon he thinks that he will be approximately at 85 compared to his best shape ever
SPEAKER_00: I understand. And does he think that Devon is in his best shape of his life? What does he think? Of course, Devon would know himself better, but what does Denis think? Denis, what do you think? Do you think that Larratt is in his best form today in his life or not? I have a feeling that yes. Well, judging by what is happening, there is something in it.
SPEAKER_00: yeah then he thinks that it's real then he says yeah it's it's hard question and hard to answer but he said uh from his later performance uh probably yes probably he is in the best shape in his life so that's interesting so what dennis is basically saying he will be
SPEAKER_04: 85 85 of his best and he is still uh planning to beat devon's uh best shape ever so basically he's saying that when he was 100 he wouldn't be able to match this what what like what it means you know he's probably right i don't know i don't know um logan misiak dennis you are a very humble arm master like john bersink
SPEAKER_00: was showing respect to your opponents. How do you feel about Devon trash-talking his opponents? There was another question from the Internet. We talked about it, but I will ask it again, because people ask it officially. They say, Denis, you are a very modest athlete, just like Ivan Brzenk. You always behave very modestly at the table. How do you feel about all this trash-talking?
SPEAKER_01: and spitting from the side of Larratt to other athletes. And how do you see it? Well, to be honest, I always, let's say, look at martial arts, even though they say that there, you know, when they shit on each other, it's more spectacular.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I can argue, because you often watch when people hug after the fight, shake hands, and before the fight at the conference, they don't behave decently. It's much more pleasant to watch. I like it in this format. I also watch it with everyone. I'm kind of for this, for the right. Well, if they choose the dark side, it's their business. I'm kind of for this.
SPEAKER_01: So yeah. Yeah. Can you hear me?
SPEAKER_00: yeah okay so the answer again was a little more complicated than just yes and no uh so answer was like this uh himself dennis basically doesn't care if somebody took the dark side of it and uh do the talk
SPEAKER_00: but uh him personally he said i would argue with uh you know popularization because of the dog because he's uh watching other other uh you know uh sports where those people are talking at the press conference to each other and it doesn't look good to him but on another hand if they're respectful on the press conference day before and they they they fight hard
SPEAKER_00: in the ring or whatever, and then they hug each other afterwards. For him, it's a better picture than the picture where they splashed the shit on each other before. I understand. That's his position.
SPEAKER_04: But he's very neutral to if anybody else doing that that their deal. He just personally doesn't like this is what what it is you know what he's exactly what it is. moment hasn't is asking Hello, you can you please ask them if he has retarded in matushenko is sparing partners in trainings.
SPEAKER_00: About Vitalik and Toktun. Okay. Yes, a question again from the Internet about Vitalik and Ivan Matyushenko, or are you sparring with them? Vitalik and Ivan Matyushenko. Well, first of all, Vitalik, he lives, not here, damn it, but he lives. Egle knows the idea of how he will come. He will never fight.
SPEAKER_01: We talked about it today. I think we will soon cross each other and train. Those who are available, of course. When you talk about the guys who live three hours away from me, even further than Turkey. I would like them to be here, I would like to spar with them, but they are far away, so I can't answer for them. They will be nearby.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Denis says that Vitaly is a little bit too far to be a regular sparring partner. He's about five hours flight from here, so it's very irregular. If Vitaly will be in the area, he said, yeah, absolutely, we'll make a deal.
SPEAKER_04: Michael Workspace, Kenya. This is a super chat. Thank you very much. They plan to change. They what? They plan to change? Yeah. They already talked and they have some plans to change. That's very good. I think they are all in Moscow area as far as I know. Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Michael Workspace, can you ask Denis how he feel about Zaur versus Georgi, which will be at the East versus West 10? The question was about Zaur and Georgi. What do you think will happen? Tsvetkov and Zaur. Well, damn.
SPEAKER_01: It's a difficult question, of course. I don't know. I was asked this question today, too. But I put 60% on Zaur, considering that they fight with Vitalik equally, more or less. I think that Vitalik will be stronger than Tsvetkov. And in this regard, I gave 60% to Zaur.
SPEAKER_00: okay okay so question again very complicated but uh uh he already answered that um is it is it something is wrong with you somewhere else today oh i didn't hear you i think your connection is going to be coming yeah uh give me just one second give me just one second yeah
SPEAKER_02: He mean he give 60% for Zhao, 40% for Tsvetkov. Tsvetkov, yeah. He close his shape with Vitaly and that's why he like this. Yeah. My opinion, 50-50. I will give 50-50 because if Tsvetkov, of course, his wrist is more good than Zhao. If Zhao can control his wrist,
SPEAKER_04: If he can control, he can beat. If not control... Zaur himself is thinking that Tsvetkov is a tougher opponent than both Ermes and Devon. This is Zaur's opinion, of course. And Tima.
SPEAKER_04: hi everyone the last match with john brzing at the king of the table six dennis was called as dennis the cyborg splenko was it discussed discussed with him what he thinks about it like did he know about it that he was called like his nickname like cyborg or something you know um denis uh
SPEAKER_00: Someone called you a cyborg, Denis. Was it agreed with you before that, or was it just spontaneous? I don't know if such things need to be agreed with. They can be called differently. I didn't even hear it, to be honest. Denis has a new nickname, a new nickname.
SPEAKER_00: It's a new one, but yeah, he said, no, no, nobody asked me for it, but it don't matter. Whatever somebody says, somebody says something. Who cares? Who cares? So next match, we call Denis the Babaiev Cyplenkov. He won't care.
SPEAKER_04: Cyborg killer. Cyborg killer, okay. Silky Wilkie, will you prefer to pull Devon at a normal grip or referee's grip? Will you look to get the strap on the first match? Like, will he want the strap?
SPEAKER_00: first round directly and will he want the referee's grip? I mean, he doesn't have to answer because these things may be his strategy, you know. But this is... Yeah, you can ask him. Yes, the question was this. And Engin says you don't have to answer because it may be your strategy. But the question was this. Will you try to make it a referee grip?
SPEAKER_00: No comments for now.
SPEAKER_04: No comments. I'm surprised. Okay, that's normal. You know, sorry for he's not answering, but that is some things you know he may he may keep it for himself. A country boys tell Denis that I am a huge fan of his, and he inspired me to be an arm. Master, and tell him good luck with Devon. Let up mesh. Can you translate this if possible?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, Emek wrote a comment that you are his idol and that thanks to you he started armwrestling. All the best and good luck to you in the fight with Lovatov. Thank you. Super. Thank you. And a while ago, did he say piton or baton?
SPEAKER_04: Python. Or Anaconda. Yeah. Anyways, is there anything you want to add, Babken? Anything you want to say? Yes, I want to send message for Devon. Of course, he do really huge job for this day.
SPEAKER_02: I respect really him. He deserves. He really deserves in his places in this belt what he has. And of course, best of the best meeting in November 11 with how you say in
SPEAKER_02: person number one, best guy in the world from sportsman, obviously. And prime guys will meet in 11 November. I wish Devon to be healthy, to come without endurance, without problems. We will waiting him in 11 November in Istanbul.
SPEAKER_04: I understand, yeah. And Denis, anything you want to add? Any message for your opponent? Any message for your opponent?
SPEAKER_00: He said, yeah, Devon, get ready, be strong. Devon't make me angry on the table and leave your tricks to yourself, please.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and Saul Aron, the guy that he makes the artworks, you know, and the posters, he's asking, can Denis confirm it is Python or we thought it was like hook? Which one is that? He needs to tell us whenever he's going to make an artwork. So which one he chooses? Just tell. What's his name, Aron?
SPEAKER_04: Sol Aron, Sol Aron is the guy that's been on the poster. Yeah, great guy. Can you ask Denis to confirm his nickname? What is it? Is it a Hulk, a Russian Hulk, or is it just Python, you know, whatever? Okay, okay. So we got to use that one.
SPEAKER_00: Denis, a person who is engaged in all posters and all drawings, asks, can you confirm how you can and should be called, nickname, Python or Russian Hulk?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. I don't care what you call it. The main thing is not to call it a pot and not to put it in the oven. That's what they say. So, I'm not going to ask you, but Babken. Babken knows for sure. Yes, Babken. He used to be a Hulk, but now he's become a python.
SPEAKER_02: Well, that's how I started to talk a little bit. Really, his style has become very much like that of Python. He just started to hug more. Hug and strangle.
SPEAKER_00: Denis answered that he doesn't care. You can call him either Hulk or Python. Just don't nickname anything else, please.
SPEAKER_00: no no barbie or something right yeah yeah but uh i i asked bob ken you know you have to know who to ask i ask bob ken and bob ken says yeah it's used to be a hulk but uh there is too many hulks right now on the market and stylistically his uh arm wrestling style right now more to the python because he is slowly yes yes yes yes so so python will be sufficient
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so probably the last question I will ask and then let's finish it. We, I personally didn't expect that domination by Devon. And I don't know if Denis expected or not. Whenever I ask Denis, what is his winning chance against Devon? And he said he cannot answer this right now, but he's going there to win.
SPEAKER_00: Can you ask him, is there any possibility for either of these guys to dominate each other or he expects a war? Okay. Engin started with the fact that he said, to be honest, he did not expect such domination from Larratt when they fought with Cermes.
SPEAKER_00: And every time he asks you what are your assumptions about your fight with Larratt, you always answer that you are going to win. And his question was probably difficult. Is it possible to dominate someone, you or Larratt, on one side, or do you still think that there will be a serious fight and a war?
SPEAKER_04: then he says i think it's going to be a war yeah this is why i expect i i don't see either of those guys dominating each other i i don't see that i i think that there will be a stop but probably one will be a little bit stronger or equally strong and then the other one will have better dominant you know endurance and then or maybe well roundness um
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and whenever he pulled John, I think in one of the rounds, he did shoulder pressure, as far as I remember. If somehow Devon opens, he also plans to do it? Like, does he work also in the press as well? Come on, Engin, it's a strategy. It's a secret. Come on. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, we shouldn't ask. Yeah, you're right. You're right.
SPEAKER_00: Let me translate a little bit. Let me translate a little bit. Can you guys?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so he started asking the question, he said, when you were fighting with John, you were pressing him shoulder to shoulder to the pillow. He said, if Larratt opens up in the corners, do you plan to do the same with him? And I said to Engin, Engin, you can't ask that, it's a secret. But I don't know, if you want, tell me.
SPEAKER_04: secret that's good that's good yeah yeah okay my question finish yes but some people just kept asking has there been a bucket has there been a secret pool with Hermes in Dubai Denis and Hermes did they have a secret pool in Dubai no no no shake hands they just get a group right yeah okay yeah
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, just one person says something and then thousands of them just believes, you know, so it's good. Yeah. Thank you very much, my friends. And Denis, thank you very much. Get get stronger. Yeah, you are a good man. I get to know you very late. Recently, I get to know you. I have huge respect for you. And Devon is also my friends. You are my friends.

SPEAKER_04: I'm thinking, I'm thinking, but not 100%. But if I come, it will be good. Last time I came, I had to compete and then I had to focus on myself, you know, my match. This time maybe we can just enjoy, you know, all together, you know.
SPEAKER_04: will be great yeah and i also thank you guys very much thanks to community i don't expect really i don't expect anyone to say you and thank you again i just don't i just don't think i deserve the the negativity or something other than that i'm just doing what i love doing it i am doing it with the passion of an arm wrestling fan
SPEAKER_02: I just look at, I have a board on the wall and I just like, what can I do more? What can I do more to make it even a better event than last time? That's what it is, you know? Yes, of course, you're honest. But it's very important, you know, think positive. And even if you don't want to trouble, don't wrote negative things, you know? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: which is important you all you know I know uh you are very sensitive about this and me I start to learn experience I heard you are a KGB guy is there fantasies you know
SPEAKER_02: go down my friend i'm simple person trying to do the best for wrestling and that's everybody if you want to do something you have to do positive no no even if you want to do you have to do something in yourself not you know talking this is will be more better for you
SPEAKER_04: I mean, those people who wrote negative things. All the best. Yeah, we have to. I get used to. I get used to, my friend. We are just going to... We will do our part. I see 98% I can say that is sporting. I see that they are not that loud, but I see the support. We will just continue, you know, we will just continue. We know that we are doing the right things and then everything will be fine once again.
SPEAKER_04: Thank you, Bob Kane. Thank you, Denis. Thank you, Paolo. We need a bicep from Denis. Oh, yeah. Their biceps, yeah, getting bigger. Take care, guys. Thank you. Bye, Paolo. Bye. Bye. Bye.
