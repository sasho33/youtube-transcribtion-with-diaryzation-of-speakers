SPEAKER_01: Amish.
SPEAKER_01: so much.
SPEAKER_01: Hello everyone. Hello community of arm wrestling. Great to see you guys in chatroom, in chatroom I should say.
SPEAKER_01: um how did the practice go that the practice went very interesting very interesting some parts are very satisfying and some parts are concerning it made me even more confused but we will see problem is
SPEAKER_03: here here here everything is fine here where i hit i feel like there is some connection problem from brain or body to the here you know everything is so fine here but we will see we will see very soon
SPEAKER_03: How are you? You will be in the car? You have good connection? Internet? I think so. Yeah, should be fine. That's good. That's good. Yeah. You are in where? California, right? Yes, I am. Hmm.
SPEAKER_03: a while you were planning to come but at the last moment i think you change your mind yeah sorry about that hello sean hello my friend hello benji undergrow arun ibrahim ibrahim joe price and doctor emiliano george little beasts
SPEAKER_03: training hello guys um Todd Hutchings will be I think you are right now sideways oh okay do you like this yeah our touchings will be a little bit late because he's coming back from the
SPEAKER_03: the training that you know he yesterday participated so he will be probably 20-25 minutes maybe I don't know maybe 30 minutes he will be late but very soon Ungarweev will join and while Todd is not with us we will be talking a lot with Ungarweev
SPEAKER_03: Kydyrgali Ongarbaev is one of the most technical guy with probably one of the highest IQ level, if not the highest. It is, how to say, I enjoy watching. Like the way that he pulls is just like, I mean, it's amazing. From other side, we have Tata Shinks.
SPEAKER_03: that can make a technical guy look like he doesn't know anything because of his side pressure. Because of his side pressure, he can really make you look like you are not that good, you know? And so that will be the question if Todd is going to make, if Todd is going to make
SPEAKER_03: on Garbe look like is not that good. You know, the power is like something that can really unable anything, you know, doesn't matter how technical you are, you need the first match that powers to apply something extraordinary. And so we will see how do you see this match? Well,
SPEAKER_03: Oh, okay. Sultan is gone, I think. Or he's back again. Sultan, while they are still not here, what do you think about this match? I don't know. I think it's 50-50.
SPEAKER_04: 50-50, yeah. Yeah, I think Qadir Ghali will try a top-roll game. Maybe, I don't know, but, like, maybe Mr. Todd is, like, amazing side pressure. Yeah. Yeah. Can be overwhelmed, I don't know. Yep. Even, like, for me to imagine pulling against Todd's,
SPEAKER_03: my elbow already like X, you know, like he said, it says like, you know, I don't want to feel that pressure. That pressure is amazing pressure. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Anyway, so we will see. Very soon we will be witnessing, in my opinion, the best armless card in history. And soon we will find out the winners. And generally, who are your picks, Sultan? Like, Denis versus Devon.
SPEAKER_04: uh i i really can't say it's hard to say yeah i'm i i think i'm rooting for dennis yeah um he he's his endurance probably the key yeah i mean they both have people talks about devon's endurance yes they are right but that guy dennis also has very good endurance
SPEAKER_03: also the guy is just not getting tired you know julio martinez thank you for your uh super shirts i think it can go either way but depends on how many hits can thought take from ongar web all the best thinking thank you very much my friend so that part i don't understand i don't know who will be hidden who i mean if ongar web is hidden
SPEAKER_03: I understand that, but we don't know. Maybe Todd will be here. And when Todd is... How are you, brother? Alhamdulillah. How are you? Where is Ongar Wahab? Ongar Wahab is here. Okay, we need to see him. Hello, Khidr Ghalib. As-salamu alaykum. As-salamu alaykum.
SPEAKER_03: um we have translator so we can we can just uh start talking can you a little bit more lift up the camera so i mean we can see more more yeah sultan can you make your phone sideways by unlocking the thing and then you also can you make that can you also tell him the to get the gallery
SPEAKER_04: Like this? I don't think that you guys it is still working. Yeah, yours is okay now.
SPEAKER_03: Yours is okay. Okay, so let's start. Can you tell him
SPEAKER_03: I don't think his phone is still the same way as far as I see. Whatever, you know. Can you tell him that Todd will be late? Like a little bit late because he is coming from training from another state to his home. So he will be a little bit late, you know. But we will continue it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: We can still talk. We don't have to work. We can still talk.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, let's start. How is his form right now?
SPEAKER_04: yeah my current form is better than the than the previously than the previous one and I also added more body weight and got more strength power and usually usually uh
SPEAKER_03: Peter Ghaly doesn't give us any prediction about his matches. He said, I prepared well and of course I came to win, but you know, who knows, you know, and in this match, does he feel confidence?
SPEAKER_04: Q. Do you have anything to say to the fans? A. I would like to say that we have a lot of time. This is a new Bangalore.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_04: He says that he will do everything to win and he can give a prediction as well. He cannot? He can give a prediction as well, yeah. Okay, what's his prediction?
SPEAKER_03: No, he said he cannot. Oh, he cannot. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Okay. It is because of his belief, right? The belief that, you know, only God knows the future type of thing, right? To talk that I'm going to do this.
SPEAKER_03: without knowing that you may not be alive tomorrow. So it is against his belief to say that he will do this for sure. Is this because of that? Can you ask him? Because many times we had this podcast, he never said he's going to win. He said he did everything to win, but he never said he's going to win. Can you ask him?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, you said that you don't have any problems with the podcast. You said that you want to balance your voice and your voice. Yes, you know that we are Kazakhs. Yes, yes. But we don't know what the future holds for us. We say that this is what will happen.
SPEAKER_04: yes so like like as as part of our religion and part of our culture we don't say anything in advance and like we always say by the god will inshallah and yeah and without humiliating someone's yeah
SPEAKER_03: So this is why I'm asking because I know the answer, but I want people to understand why Eder Gali never says that, oh, he's going to win for sure and this and that. Yeah, that is the thing. And he said that his form is better than the previous matches. And is there anyone that he wants to face if he wins this match?
SPEAKER_03: in 105 kilo i know in 115 kilo he wants to pull devon larat but if he wins this match is there anyone like like dalekian or prudnik does he want anyone any of these guys for 105 kilo
SPEAKER_04: So me and my team are like thinking about pulling Devon.
SPEAKER_03: in 105 kg limit yeah yeah devon wants to go down he's already down to uh 250 255 around there so 231 i think he can easily make it he knows how to do water cuts and it will be incredible yeah it will be incredible and does he have anything anything to take care from the past about prudnik
SPEAKER_03: Do you mean like if he has interest in pulling Prudnik after the previous loss? No, he lost against Prudnik at the top eight. Does he have something to take care of, you know, like a revenge, you know? Sure, sure. Soon or late, not now, but soon or late, you know.
SPEAKER_04: Do you have a job with Prudnik? Yes, I have a job with Revan.
SPEAKER_04: I do not choose myself. I choose to work with the international sports club. My coaches do not say that.
SPEAKER_04: yeah he he says that uh that that much is also in our plan but like as he said before uh he always uh suggest uh consult with his uh coaches and uh shardara arm sport uh club members yeah
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah that's interesting that you know it's not interesting but in a positive way that whenever i offer something usually i contact mazgan and then they say we're gonna sit down with the whole team and then we will discuss and then we will decide i never ever get a direct answer or anything like that always they discuss a few days and then they give me the
SPEAKER_03: the answer later there is a super chat sean kraut thank you my friends what does kidigali think the percentage of importance is between table time and the weight training for example just say like 70 percent table time and 30 percent weight this one example how does he think the percentage should be the importance table time and the weight
SPEAKER_04: Kadyr Ghalem, I have a question for you. In practice, what is the proportion between the two of you? 50-50 or 70-30?
SPEAKER_04: Is there a lot of practice before the tournament? Yes, there is a lot of practice before the tournament. There is a lot of practice before the tournament. There is a lot of practice before the tournament.
SPEAKER_04: Now, in our country, in every part of the world, we have to look at the big cities. If the cities are small, we have to look at the big cities. If the cities are small, we have to look at the big cities. Practically, we have to look at the big cities.
SPEAKER_04: So as I understood like when there is a match or tournament like in advance you just do uh you just uh like
SPEAKER_04: works work with weights and like when it comes to close when it comes close to the match or tournament you just increase your table time more yeah that makes good sense yeah
SPEAKER_03: Yep. And how did he find the card, you know, generally? Does he think that this is the best East versus West so far? Among all of them?
SPEAKER_04: Artem you talking about the match in Aldaga? Yes. Artem you talking about the match in Aldaga? Yes, I am talking about the match in Aldaga. I am talking about the match in Aldaga.
SPEAKER_04: I think every athlete has their own strengths and weaknesses. I always say this when I meet new people. Everyone is different. You can see it for yourself. Everyone is different.
SPEAKER_03: As he says, every match there is very interesting for me. If you talk about some of the matches, for example, what does he think about Sasho vs John Brzee match? He pulled against both of them.
SPEAKER_04: What do you think about the match between Sasho and John Brzenk? Do you agree with each other? You don't have to ask provocative questions for everyone, but Murat? Sasho is young and strong. John Brzenk...
SPEAKER_04: So he said like Sasho is a young guy, but John is a legend and he thinks that John will beat Sasho. OK, hello Todd, how are you welcome? Hi everybody. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: How are you? I heard that you are very strong. John told me you feel very strong. John says nice things about everybody. You can't believe everything he says. Yeah, but somehow I believe him. I'm stronger than I look. You may be in bad shape. Well, we'll certainly find out in a few weeks. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Sultan, can you ask Qadir Ghali, what does he think these guys over 55 is just still kicking ass and being so strong? Is he like, does he think that's amazing?
SPEAKER_03: Did he hear the question? Oh, not me? No, I didn't hear the question.
SPEAKER_04: no no i asked him a question but his his microphone was muted you know so i don't know if he did yeah can you repeat the question so we can go faster a little bit yeah
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I am a professional athlete. I used to train with these people when I was a kid. Now I train with them in the gym. Now I train with them in the gym. I train with them in the gym. Now I train with them in the gym. Now I train with them in the gym.
SPEAKER_04: He said that he grew up watching Mr. Todd too, like watching his matches, seeing him beating the big guys. He also had a thought that sometime he will have a chance to pull Todd and now here's his chance. Wow, that's good. See, they grew up by watching you kicking the giant asses.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yeah, that's good. That's good. That's good. And what's your weight right now, Todd? I'm 225. 225. Okay. So you're around like 102 kilo, 103, yeah, around there. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. That's good. And this was your last table time? No, no. I'll pull four more times.
SPEAKER_02: i'll pull i'm pulling tuesdays and thursdays so i'll pull the next two weeks and then um we'll leave tuesday night to come to turkey so that's that's when i stopped how do you recover man how do you recover you know i mean oh i'm fresh as a daisy i recovered just fine
SPEAKER_03: Wow, but I don't know how that happened. I don't understand. You gotta do your JN presses. It'll fix things. I mean, I do them. I do them. Paul also told me, Pauline, he says, hang in talk. Tell me to do it. I do. It still hurts, he says. Anyway, so Kedirgade said that John is gonna win, probably. And what do you think about John
SPEAKER_03: Like, the question is, John should go down to 95 or 100 kilo? I'm sure you guys talked about it. We did. I think, I mean, I think he should, I think he could, but the last I heard is I don't expect him to. I think he'll stay at whatever the other weight was y'all discussed. Feels stronger, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and I understand, yeah. And how do you see this match, Todd?
SPEAKER_03: I think John will pull Sasho like he pulled Zurab. So I think it'll go probably about the same way. Yeah. Uh, overall. Yeah. I understand. Um, Sasho has probably stronger cup, you know, to not to lose the, uh, wrist. Yeah. His maybe side pressure in flat wrist trepanation position is strong. But whenever I see Sasho losing, usually he's losing to his,
SPEAKER_03: So you are going to pull him, right? February. January 20th. Oh, I guess it's January now. I was planning February. So okay, well, when November's over, just tell me the real date and then I'll start booking. Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay, okay. The question, what is your chance to become a double champion of the world?
SPEAKER_02: It can't be very high, but I do like my chances. Do you think that your chances is higher in 95 or 105? I think my chances at 95 are a lot higher just because I'm not, because everybody will be so much shorter. You know, I have trouble with these tall people. But it doesn't mean that you are coming here to lose. No, I like my chances in November.
SPEAKER_03: think they're pretty good i think they're they're they're 50 50 if not a little higher john john john is thinking that you're gonna win yesterday yesterday i i chatted a little bit with him and he said that you're gonna win that's what he said yeah
SPEAKER_03: There is a super chat from Sean Crowther, my friend. What is Kendergali philosophy or weight training? What sort of training blocks does he do? What rep branch does he type? Can you read that, Sultan? Your English is probably better. I hit my head. I fell down touch last week, 11 days ago. I'm like,
SPEAKER_03: know that's what i heard you got to be careful yeah when you get that many candles on your birthday cake you got to be careful but it can't have you losing a hip next time you're right sultan i think your microphone and okay whatever we talk with you are you there sultan
SPEAKER_03: anyway so yes okay can you can you uh read the last super chat can you see the the chat let me see so you both are thinking that john is gonna be beat sasha this is what you are saying is there any other match that you are interested do you know the other guys or you don't follow at all todd oh i'm gonna watch dennis beat devin
SPEAKER_02: Oh, it's because you have the worst technique, right? Yeah, Devon's got absolutely terrible technique. Denis is just going to take him to school. No, no, you get offended and this is why you are making this prediction or? No, it's because Devon's video. So, yeah, according to Devon, Denis will have bad technique. But I think...
SPEAKER_02: I'm on Team Denis next month. Why is it you are from Team West? Say again? You are from the West. Why you support Denis? I can't help it. Maybe Denis needs to switch teams.
SPEAKER_03: oh okay so you're sending devon to the east and then taking dennis back to the west yes i'll do that okay that's interesting did you read the super chat sultan uh yes i did can you hear me yeah yeah can you ask to uh
SPEAKER_04: Could you tell us how many years you have been in the music industry? What are your degrees? What are your strengths? What are your strengths? How many years have you been in the music industry?
SPEAKER_04: Did it work? Yes, it worked. I don't know how to say this. I don't know if you can hear it. I don't know. I don't know if you can hear it. I don't know if you can hear it.
SPEAKER_04: When I saw your videos, you said that you were going to put a riser on it. Yes, yes. How much do you take? I put 90 kilos on it. Artem you an Arabian or not? I am an Arabian. 60 kilos.
SPEAKER_04: What is your name? What is your name? What is your name? What is your name? What is your name? What is your name? What is your name?
SPEAKER_04: so like he mostly trains two parts like since he's a top roller he trains his riser with 50 60 kilogram weights his uh yeah working weight but max maximum he does 90 kg riser
SPEAKER_04: and also like he trains wrist with the barbell yeah for for his uh main uh pulling part like his style if that answered the questions here okay there is john augustine hello everyone does ongar we have think that he will have difficulties pulling with hutchings due to his unorthodox style his side pressure
SPEAKER_04: and style seems to throw people off of their game. Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_04: So yeah, he's specifically training to deal with that side pressure. And yeah, as usually, he said, we would see. I understand. Yeah, as usually, he doesn't say he will be successful this and that. He says, we will see. And it's normal. I understand.
SPEAKER_03: From his perspective, and some other matches on Garber. Is there any match that you are interested in this card? Like, for example, Zaur versus Georgi Tsvetkov. Who is winning there? In the previous matches, Zaur and Tsvetkov were playing. Now they are playing a very close match.
SPEAKER_04: It's going to be an interesting match.
SPEAKER_03: coming from injury. They both stop roll, but he thinks Zaur will win because, like, he's heavier. Probably they are the same weight, but, yeah. And, Todd, this match is something that, you know, I will try to pick the matches that you guys know about it. This is, you are very familiar with these guys, Todd. Irakli Zirakashvili, Ruslan Babaiev. It's an interesting match.
SPEAKER_03: Rustam. Rustam, do you think he's going to hook Irakli or beat him in some different ways? Because you beat Irakli, but you beat Irakli in a way that I don't think that Rustam can beat, like in the way that you beat. Rustam needs to beat him in a different way. Do you think that Rustam is going to top roll him or hook him or how is he going to beat him?
SPEAKER_02: i think i think rustam's had enough time to watch my match and figure out how to do it for himself i am going to teach all the inside pullers how to put how to beat top rollers so that will be my legacy when i retire so rustam will be my first student college you need to be built different you know not it's not i don't think it's about like only teaching you know not everyone has that the elbow genetic that you have that you are
SPEAKER_03: applying that kind of pressure just it's just like you have like 20 years of base you know yeah i don't think that we will just learn and start doing it in that yeah we became positive
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but Rustam only needs to do it three times. So I think he's learned enough to do it three times. You know that, right? You lost your wrist a little bit when you beat Heraklis, and then you beat him like this way. So, yeah, so I don't remember when last time Rustam is really harmless in that way. He either hooks or fast copying, you know, probably, you know, the way how he wins, you know.
SPEAKER_02: It would be very hard to hook Irakli. He's fast enough, and he sets up high enough. I mean, if Rustam's trying to hook Irakli, that's going to be a very terrible day for Rustam. Well, if he tries to hook Irakli. OK, OK. How about his top row? How about his top row? Can he have a chance to top row Irakli? Let me check.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I, I, I like a rock. If, if Rustam tries to top roll a Rockley, I think Rockley will have the height in the hand. So I think, I think a Rockley wins that match too. I still think Rustam can win. I just don't think he's gonna hook or top roll them. Wow. And you are confident that Rustam will be able to apply what you applied. Wow. That's that's, that's interesting. That's interesting because, because the guy doesn't even train that way. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: We will see. Well, he hasn't trained like that yet. He's been doing it secretly. He's been doing it secretly since he's got this match. And how do you see that match, Irakli versus Rustam? 95 kilo. 95 kilo. Yeah, Irakli and Rustam Babaiev. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: If I were a player, I would choose Istanbul, right? Why do you think so? Because it is a good blocker. It has a lot of connections.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, he thinks Rustam Babaiev will win because he has better connections and the side pressure. But can you ask him which style he's going to be in? Can you repeat that? I'm sorry. In which style he...
SPEAKER_04: Can you tell us more about Rustam Irakli? Is he a hooker? Is he a striker? Is he a blocker? Is he a blocker?
SPEAKER_04: As I understood, it's going to be a flop press. Yeah, flop press is almost what Taz said, but Taz is more like sideway.
SPEAKER_03: while it is a tricep as far as i heard you know it's a tricep right he said yeah i repeat it and he said yeah but like it's like uh russian wins like this or yes
SPEAKER_03: okay yeah that that is one of the matches that you know they both are very uh familiar with these guys you know and we will see we will see the the next one yeah um i'm not 100 sure today i'm gonna make decision
SPEAKER_03: If not, most likely I will bring Abdulmanaf to ZF against Samushia because I pulled. I had an accident. So I don't know. Today I had some table training. It even confused me even more. Some parts were very strong. Some parts were just like no connection. Does he think that I have any chance against Samushia if I pull?
SPEAKER_04: Q. Today you said that you are training, but you have lost a few matches. Of course, how do you think my chances will be? If your skills are better than that of Trump, then it will be easy for you.
SPEAKER_04: If you feel your arms are free from any pain, you can just do a top roll with side blocks and you should be fine. Yeah, he thinks I have a chance to win.
SPEAKER_03: Let's talk about the main match. I know there are so many matches, but some of them I'm sure you are not so familiar with. Denis vs Devon, you said Denis is going to win. As someone who is known to be very smart,
SPEAKER_03: um i i consider you someone who started our messing uh late that is why your i don't know the the application of the technique i don't find you smooth but i find it very smart you know um you are an engineer and very smart guy um how do you see this mesh like like in details in a technical analysis can you make for us
SPEAKER_03: Your voice is not, your sound is, we don't hear you. You need to touch the screen. Just touch the screen once and you will see the sound and then click on it. Yeah, yeah. Can you hear me now? Yeah, yeah. Can you break down, you know, like I want to hear, you know, what you are thinking.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think Denis has to just get Devon Palm up any way he can. And I think that's what, so I think that's what, I think Denis has been watching Devon's matches. So he's had ample time to, you know, learn that. At least that's how I'd prepare for a match with Devon. So I'm assuming Denis is doing the same thing. And then how do you expect match to go? Okay, ready, go. Then what's happening now?
SPEAKER_02: Uh, I think Devon gets, I think, let's see, Denis might be as, I think Devon's probably quicker off go than Denis is, but I think Denis will have the copy to, uh, turn them over. So I think it, uh, I think Devon hits a little bit. Denis goes a little bit losing side, but then recovers and then just drags them down. Oh, okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: you see any any have you been following dennis's videos training videos have i been following dennis's videos yeah yeah training videos no
SPEAKER_03: Because he doesn't really arm wrestle this way, but now he started more like pronation. He doesn't really follow pronator a lot as it used to be, that side pressure, but more like he has a little bit of cop, and then with calm, he pronates, pronates, and beats the guys that way. So if you just now know that Denis is going to go outside to top rope,
SPEAKER_02: Devon, do you still feel the same way about the outcome? Yeah, I think Denis knows he has to turn Devon's palm up. So by training this, I think he knows he's got to get Devon's palm up. That's what I know.
SPEAKER_03: So you think he needs to make this, yeah. But he doesn't have the cup he used to have, but he has much stronger pronator now, and I kind of feel that stronger left, you know. Can you ask to Ongar Bayev about this match, Kedirghali? Yeah, Kedirghali.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know if I can answer that. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match. It was a very close match.
SPEAKER_04: I don't want to say my name, but I came from a far place. I came from a far place. I'm not very good at playing lacrosse, but I'm a happy athlete. I don't want to say where I came from.
SPEAKER_04: He can't really say how the fight will go. He thinks it's 50-50.
SPEAKER_04: and uh but since uh devon like pulls uh outside and inside so it's it's hard to say what's gonna be here so he's saying that you know devon is more versatile well-rounded and then has more options yes okay sean crowther saying is the shadar armas in school private or would i be able to
SPEAKER_03: train there. If I made a trip to Kazakhstan for a week or two, can you ask to the, to, uh, uh, maybe much gun? Yes. Yeah. Is there, is the Shardara arm wrestling club, is that private or if someone from Canada comes one week or something, can he train with you guys? We going to Canada?
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no. Someone from Canada. He is a close friend of Matt Mask. If he comes to your Shardara for one week, he can train with you guys or not? Yes, we have... I would like to say that we have a lot of people from Korea, Uzbekistan, Malaysia, Croatia, and other countries.
SPEAKER_01: We don't do anything, but if we have a chance, we will try to do it with our team and with the help of our team members.
SPEAKER_04: yeah if if that person sends a request we will like consider it and give an answer with his team with team here but usually like guys from korea uzbekistan croatia already came and trained at the complex yeah
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, Sean will be in Istanbul as far as I know, and Mazgam will be there as well. They can talk. I can introduce them to each other, and then they can talk. So, Tat, you know, you may be getting two titles. And one is November 11th, you are saying 50-50, and for January, you like your chances more than 50-50. And
SPEAKER_03: I think that the winner of Rustam and Irakli will probably pull Pauline in January.
SPEAKER_03: and then probably the winner of that match like is there anyone that you also like it is to pull i'm sure that you need to focus on the next match i'm just saying that like i know i know if i if i have a match i would hate to hear such questions so um like is do you see any dangers at the 95 kilo like like do you have any thing to take care from the past like for example with rustam baba
SPEAKER_02: Rustam would be my biggest. It's like you just posted that picture of the rankings and the Babaiev, obviously Babaiev has given me fits for years. So yeah, he's the one I'm most nervous about, but he's also the one I'm most excited about because hopefully I can settle that score finally. Yeah, but in the past you were like more like, you know, now you protect your pronate and go that way.
SPEAKER_03: expect it to be like, tougher, tougher than the previous ones, you know. I'm sure that like, I'm sure that you also think in that way in the past to hook him, you were giving up on your pronator and then he was just copying your pronator, you know, at the same time, while now you are really putting so much pressure to the hand. And but also he is known to have very strong hands. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: at that time you probably didn't know how to sleep either you know don't know disrespect but now you are doing very well you know i think i think i think that the turning point was you versus zoleo hajumrat match in the east versus west one you know the the the match that do you do you can you imagine yourself losing that match if they were in the step yeah i uh
SPEAKER_02: I relive that match a lot. When I have bad dreams, it's that match. It's like, man, I wish I could have just did it differently. But, you know, I'm just now entering my prime. So I've learned a lot of things. So I'll be a lot better now.
SPEAKER_03: If anyone else in over 55 would tell me that they are entering the prime now, I would just laugh. But with you, I'm taking very seriously. And I see that. I see that. Yep. Anyways, so anyways, guys, I don't want to take your time so much. And only how many days left you to arrive here? Probably 16 days or something. And it will be great to see you guys again. And you want the room from the seaside, correct?
SPEAKER_02: Absolutely not. Kirtagali wants to look at the ocean. He can have the ocean side. Right above the parking lot where all the loud cars are. That happened only one time, and you won that time. And then whenever I put you to the train side, then you lost to Brutnich.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but I think I won Iraq. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, I'm, I'm just easy. Yeah. And any, anything you would like to add before we finish the podcast? Uh, Todd. Just that, um, I've been running into Kier Kydyrgali and his team for years now. I met him in Russia, walking around on the streets in Turkey a few times and Poland several times.

SPEAKER_03: Everything will be better for us. Thank you very much, Todd, for being our guest. And see you very soon, my friend. There is one more super chat. I don't want to disrespect anyone. Sean. Possibly the most important question. Is Todd working on a song for Kydyrgali? It's going to be the best one yet. Oh, are you going to make one? Yep. Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So tell him that he's going to make a song for him. OK. What does he say?
SPEAKER_03: I didn't hear any song. He will wait for it. Tell him to listen to Billy Idol songs. It will be a Billy Idol song from America. Yeah, probably he won't even care. I don't even really think that he's really following a lot, you know.
