SPEAKER_00: And Dennis defeat Levan now. Levan is now injured and not sure if Dennis is at that level yet. But Gabriela, Master Jack Gabriela is gonna pull Barbora, the revenge match. Okay, the thing is Gabriela didn't, like Gabriela,
SPEAKER_00: Arsenal versus Canada, we don't know my friend, dark side, yeah. How about we focus on the next event? Like we can just sit down here and then set 300 imaginary super match, but why do we set these matches if we are not gonna enjoy the ones that are actually set? You know, that part I will never understand. Yep, I train my time, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Um, yeah, late January. Yeah, most likely, most likely. How can you not love Sarah?
SPEAKER_00: Not bad, you know, not bad, but you see the bottom of the hand is also, there are two parts that is, that's with the muscle in here. It is...
SPEAKER_00: um 44 stronger um rosa i think she is originally from costa rica but right now is representing germany as far as i know yeah it will be great to see you jay it will be great yeah sarah sarah tried to hook gabriella
SPEAKER_00: I don't know why she had to try over and over, but... Hello. How are you? Good to see you. Good to see you. Me too. Yeah. How are you? I think good. Good? Yeah, it's great. You know, you are one of the best female pullers in history.
SPEAKER_00: Probably the, like, especially if you talk about your prime with left arm, you dominated everyone for like many years, more than a decade. And with right arm, you were up there, you know, most of the times after Machiavelli. And people may not know, but you are one of the gods of the female armors. I said, people may not know because you are not so,
SPEAKER_00: active on social media that like you are not really self-promoting a lot uh but the guys who are watching us this this lady here is uh for sure for sure uh one of the few gods of the female are missing um yeah and and then soon soon we will see you uh soon sarah i think sarah just came
SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, Sarah is here too. Hi. Hello Sarah. Great to see you. Great to see you guys. Yeah. Guys, I won't be able to, as you know, when I have the guests, mostly I talk with them. When I do alone, you know, the chat. So I chat with you guys. So don't get offended if I cannot really follow it. And how are you, Sarah? I'm good. You're good? Yeah. Yeah. And then...
SPEAKER_01: little bit more than a month left and how is the preparation yeah no i have uh always been preparing for this match i feel like since last time 11 years ago i mean egla is the one to beat for me you know she's you know she's in my path so like i need to like this is it you know this is huge
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask you. Like, how is the psychology? Because, you know, you are not the same Sarah 10 years ago, you are like, completely different person, you know, and then you were also world champion. But now I see that you are at another level. At that time, Egle comfortably won at that time.
SPEAKER_00: But you know that you are not the same person, and that's the reason if you didn't believe in yourself. And also, you cannot really claim to be a top one without facing the top ones. I mean, win or lose, these matches have to happen. So my question is, how is it that psychologically, to prepare this match, what happened 10 years ago, does it play in your head?
SPEAKER_01: Uh, no, I mean, okay. So like, yes, a little bit, maybe, um, to me, it's like a mountain that I need to climb, you know, and I have failed every time in the past. Right. How many times, one second, one second. How many times did you pull other than the super match I organized? Have you pulled her? Uh, yeah, exactly. Your, your event. Uh, but I also feel like, um, one time in Sweden, maybe at the world challenge,
SPEAKER_01: yeah um so maybe twice we pulled oh and slotty slotty too yeah yeah in 2000 um
SPEAKER_01: 12 she beat me and i came i played second um but it's never even been a match like i've never held her it was never a war it was always engaged yeah yeah so like yeah but i have gained probably i don't know 15 20 kilo since then like i'm i'm walking around at 85 and i was 65 back then you know so that probably you know plays a role
SPEAKER_00: Can you imagine that, you know, there are pullers like you ladies that exist, but not meeting, you know, it is just like criminal, you know, like, that's like, like, you understand, like, there are athletes like you that exist on this world in different parts, but these matches are not happening, you know, it's terrible, you know, it bothers me, you know, so much.
SPEAKER_01: but like now you're here and you're making that change because of you this is happening so thanks to you you know like i agree like it's it breaks my heart when i'm telling people like i'm going against egg right like that's that's okay
SPEAKER_01: huge to me. People in arm wrestling that has been around, like they understand the weight that this carry. But so many people don't know. And it's like, you know, so like, hopefully, like, this is our contribution to make the sport grow, right? Like, this is like the opportunity to show like this, and you know, like, I think that's great.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah there are times that you know i fail to organize uh enough of uh female matches that which is my fault and i apologize but i will try to do
SPEAKER_00: more but there are there are some times that you know at the beginning you know when you are plants you like i try to give to community what they want and also what is writing to do from my side you know a little bit of that little bit of that but so now everything is getting people are getting used to they're able
SPEAKER_00: the world now whenever i set a match they know oh this guy oh that guy you know and it is it is yeah great like your match with eglet is a historical match yeah like a big huge match you know like for me like there is no difference on that way of touching even like dennis versus devon and the four female are missing this is what it is you know like sarah beckman and eglet you know
SPEAKER_00: There are a few names that I would like to see, like Irina, Mateo, Heidi Anderson. I would love them to come back. And then, yeah, I just, yeah, yeah. Many people don't even know, like, how there are many great female pullers, you know? And Egle, how do you see this match? Egle, last time you came here, you pulled Gabriela, and I think Gabriela was around, like,
SPEAKER_00: 10 kilo heavier than you and it was plus 80 kilo category and but you I kind of felt I may be wrong that you were a little bit upset with the result I may be wrong and like and then whenever
SPEAKER_00: I asked you to pull against Sarah. You, I said like, are you training? And you said, I never stopped training. And, and I love the dancers because I was like, you know, what if I get discouraged? And if she stops, you know, I was as a fan, it worries me. And how is your shape right now? And what is the mindset you have to pull Sarah again after 10 years? I never afraid to lose.
SPEAKER_02: It's sometimes need to lose that. You see, um, how are you and is there something new? So now I feel not good because, uh, from April I live on diet and it's not easy, believe me to live and train and work. It's not easy, but I don't know. We will see.
SPEAKER_00: Of course, I always prepare. I always prepare. I can always fight today, tomorrow. Good. Good, good, good. I have a question. Like, no matter what the result of this match, would you wish your match to be plus 80 kilo instead of 80 kilo category? The next match? Because you have been on diet. Like, for example, would you pull someone like Barbara? Are you ready for, yeah?
SPEAKER_00: i think but not maybe now because i am i am too light okay you want you need time you need time yeah a little bit yes because i am too light for her how about someone like someone like uh um irina
SPEAKER_00: Was that from Georgia? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But she is proud. She is 90 kilo champion, right? Yes. Play second, no? No, no, she won't. She won't. Oh, she won one arm? Okay. She won, yeah. Of course, she right arm, she won. I didn't check the left arm, but.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and you won against her, you know. That should have been a title match, Sara, but at that time, we were not that well organized. It was like the first pancake. Yeah, no, it was like a triad. Yeah, I get it. Yeah, no, no, the level of the match was very high, you know, so it should have been a title match, but we started the title matches so late. So what I'm just saying, Eglet, do you expect tougher Sara?
SPEAKER_02: than the last time you met her how do you see your chances um of course i want to win i knew everything that i went but i uh respect her for how i respect her her opponent and i think she's strong she looks great that's than i because i don't know how hate she is i'm 1 meter 80. so it's yeah i'm 174. yes
SPEAKER_00: you have six six centimeters yeah yeah so big difference but still there is some difference yeah yeah do you think that stylistically this is uh how is this match compared to the gabriella match i um if really i don't know
SPEAKER_00: Hmm. Okay. Sarah, when you, when you met Gabriela, it was 80 kilo category. Yes. Yeah. But when, when Gabriela pulled Egle, I think she was 94 kilo as far as I remember. So yeah. So possibly that Gabriela that pulled Egle probably was a little bit stronger than Gabriela that paced you. Probably. Yeah. Yeah. And how is your shape compared to that time?
SPEAKER_01: I think I'm I mean, it's so hard to say, but like just based on my my team and the people I train with, they think I feel stronger now than back then. So that's kind of my like how I rate my performance right now, like how my strength and everything. So, yeah, we'll see. Yeah. Like I'm walking around around 85 kilo.
SPEAKER_01: And to me, that's a little bit heavy. I like when I'm 80 kilo more. But I understand, and this is something that the male category inspire me so much. Like, if you want to be the best in the world, you need to let that weight cap go, I think. You need to let the athlete be whoever they are.
SPEAKER_00: know to reach their peak performance you know if it's if you're 90 kilo like it shouldn't matter if you're fighting for the number one spot in the world that's why we have the open category you know if you are really that good then you pull the open category and it's always welcome you know but but not everyone is when you go to the world level
SPEAKER_00: Like those, those, like, it is very, very hard as 70 kilo guy to be 80 kilo guy, you know, very, very hard 80 kilo guy to be 90 kilo guy. So normally a 70 kilo guy can beat even 200 kilo guy, but it depends on the level of the 200 kilo guy. Yeah. So to me, for me, like, because you were just trying to make a comeback and then pandemic happened, right? Yeah. Me?
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah so what i'm just trying to say that and then like 2020 was just a wasted year for arm wrestling and then 221 we started you know like so like you came to east versus west but what i'm just saying that i think you are just reaching your peak this this is my opinion
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I agree. Like I 2020 2019, like was kind of my comeback, and I had surgery and all that. But yeah, I'm definitely starting to feel like now after four years of consistency, I'm feeling like I'm, I'm getting there, you know, I, I'm like, I don't think I'm at my peak, but I'm way like, I'm on every day, you're getting closer and closer. I think that
SPEAKER_00: between 2013 to 2018-19 but those years you quit and now these are the years that you are going up there you know this this is how i feel about you i think i think that even a year two years later i think you will be even getting uh stronger and how do you expect your match to you know like half match you expect or you plan to dominate her or i know you respect her you wouldn't maybe probably
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, no, exactly. This is such an honor for me. I love that I have this opportunity. It will be a huge test for me to see where I'm at. It's so hard to give predictions when she's right there. But I would like to win.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, she don't need to be that shy to say that. I don't know, you know. I have specifically like studied her now for a while and I have developed some things to make it go in my favor.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah no i really hope i went after gabriella i changed a little bit not a little bit a lot of yeah oh you changed your preparation or your style yes of course yes style and preparations because um how i said sometimes you need to lose because when every year you go easily win easily you don't need to progress nothing change and if when you lose then you think what to do
SPEAKER_01: that you need to change something. Because my body is... I mean, I love this so much. It's like, what's going to happen? Because you post nothing. There's no information about you. There's no update. There's no video. So it's going to be like a surprise. So yeah, we'll see, I guess. Yeah, I mean, when you are a top arm master,
SPEAKER_00: you should be ready for anything and then whenever you you that's why we have like five rounds you know if it necessary you know so you will figure out you know and i'm sure that you are ready but i would be surprised can you imagine english just like this you would be surprised right sarah if she would go inside yeah yeah yeah yeah let's see let's see how we do there's a super chat for you um
SPEAKER_00: DB talks, hello Sarah, I saw an old video where you faced Irina Gladkaya and it was close. Would you ever want to face her again or are you too strong now? I think that before she answers, I need to say Gladkaya is minus 70 kilo while I think Sarah right now is in another category, but what's your answer?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, she was like, she was like my opponent, my biggest opponent at the time, like 10 plus years ago, like it was she and me in the 65 kilo category. It was always close. Whoever had a better day won. It's impossible for me to know now. I believe I'm stronger.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah the lighter girls and also like i'm not at all willing to go down to 70 kilo not even 75 kilo like i'm like not even 80 kilos probably yeah yeah yeah and and what the question is how about nikisha like was nikisha was prime after you left yeah or even during your time she was
SPEAKER_00: yeah no i never she never had a win over me okay but later years she became world champion as well right and then irina glaskaya and her they were going like head to head i i think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i i i will also invite
SPEAKER_00: I'm also trying to get involved with the 60 kilo girl. You remember the Russian, the dominating one? What's her name?
SPEAKER_00: That's why I'm asking you just to change her last name, Afonina. Yeah. Yeah. Afonina. That would be awesome. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That's also great. Yeah. I want, I want all the superstars like to compete and then we see them, you know, together, it will be great. Yeah. And so you said that you change a lot of things after Gabriela match. So can we say that,
SPEAKER_02: right now your mind is like like your mind focused on sarah but back side of your mind somewhere there is an unfinished business about gabriella i can um go this time again um i do a little bit other things so i don't know it helps or not so i tried with sarah if it helps
SPEAKER_00: okay i go this this way if not i look something new okay okay like when you say that like you shouldn't be limited to like a weight category like do i understand corrected
SPEAKER_01: Like, you also want to pull the supers? Like, would you pull someone like Barbara? Yes. Yes. And here's like, this is like a recent change in me, right? Like, I was on Gabby for so many years. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: but i'm like i have like grown or matured as a person i don't know like i'm so inspired by all the males in the sport right now like everybody is returning every month every two months yeah win or lose it doesn't matter because it's yes facing the best and i'm like
SPEAKER_01: i want to be like that you know so i made a deal with myself like i'm not going to turn down any offers like i want to pull whoever it's a great contribution to the sport it's going to make me grow as an athlete you know to to get out of my comfort zone so yeah you understand like i i kind of think that you know a warrior you know
SPEAKER_00: step on the battlefield 100 times and won 95 times and lost five times is better than the warrior that step only 10 times and won all of them. You understand? The beauty is just go there and compete in a war, win, lose, whatever. Today you lose,
SPEAKER_01: Next time you win, you know, just, yeah. I just want to bring, like, I know for myself, like, when East vs. West or King of the Table or any other pay-per-view is, like, on a Saturday, I'm like, ooh, like, it's my favorite day. Like, I buy the pay-per-view. Like, it's my favorite day, right? And I know that all the arm wrestlers feel the same. So, like, if you can give that back to other arm wrestlers, you know, that's great for everybody. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yes yes yes yes i'm trying to convince many people now i'm bringing here arsene lillier as a special guest so it is my sneaky plan you know because i almost convinced him before before the war and now he just changed his mind and things like that but now i'm bringing oh just come come you know as a special guest whenever he's close you know i will be all the time whispering to his ear you know and then
SPEAKER_00: hopefully i'm gonna make him back as well, you know that is my job awesome. yeah yeah let's see let's see let's see how it will be everything looks great and I just can't wait I don't know how the match will go um I don't know you are.
SPEAKER_00: one of the best pools like there are not many female arm wrestlers that are able to use their wrists like male ones like it's not no disrespect their their risk creation is a little bit um more sensitive you know and they just you know you know that way but but you and egle are those two of those
SPEAKER_00: a few or maybe more than a few, but you know just really using the hand and wrist you know, so I kind of think that it will be a technical battle if it goes to do horsepower like you know.
SPEAKER_00: It may be different, but it is not that easy to get Egle there, you know? But then I kind of think that it will be a battle of the risks, you know? And then whose risks will survive will be the winners. Like, this is how I see it. But I have no idea. I know how strong you are. And anyone who underestimates Egle knows nothing about arm wrestling. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And Egle, are you excited to be back again? Yes, of course. Of course. Yeah, we are also excited to host both of you here. And it will be incredible. And generally, did you like the CART, you know, the full CART event? Yes, of course. Super.
SPEAKER_02: super right yeah yeah yeah like it is my motivation you know it's my motivation when people says oh great job i'm like oh i need to do even better you understand your hands and i think you are prepared 100 percent percent what's that your hands is very big so i think you prepare for this competition very good oh you told my arm is bigger
SPEAKER_00: it just looks that way it's just it's weak you know but no i don't know i don't know my opponent is you know the best in the world you know if i have these hands i don't afraid at all it's normal you are in the female category yeah and and sarah did you like the whole card yeah i mean i always and i i see like i feel the same like everybody else like
SPEAKER_01: One pay-per-view comes out and you're like, oh, it cannot get better than this. And then the next pay-per-view comes and like, it is better than the last. Like, how does it always get better? Like, I don't get it. It's amazing. Like, it's a dream for arm wrestling. Yeah, but do you know how we just get them better?
SPEAKER_00: Like nobody has anything magical, you know, because we are that beautiful sport because we have so many talents. So there is the potential. All I am doing is just bringing that potential to here. Like nobody is just making something that doesn't exist. You know, it is because we are beautiful, you know, all together, you know, so you ladies want to a little bit predict the event.
SPEAKER_00: Sure, Engin. Okay, yeah. I kind of heard something not super confident, you know. Yeah, we can do it. Yeah, I have it pulled up here. Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, okay. I'm sure that you know all the names. I mean, you have been involved the whole day long, almost getting close to the case, more than one and a half decades for sure.
SPEAKER_00: Um, okay. Let's start with this one. This one, I only want percentage. I don't want any kind of detail about the match. I just want you to say, this has this many chance, like percentage in this, that one. I started with Sara. Egle White Kute versus Sara Beckman. It's normal that we, uh, Sara want to win. I want to win too. It's normal. I think.
SPEAKER_00: I know, I know, but I'm just asking the prediction. I'm just asking the prediction. Okay, so percentage or 3-2 or percentage? Oh, no, I mean like winning chance, winning, like reaching to the three, top three. Or you can also say both, score prediction as well. Okay, yeah, no, 4-1 to me. Oh, 4-1, Sarah Beckman is winning. And you, Egle?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. Don't be humble anymore. She fired first. She fired. Yeah, give it to me. Okay, it's no problem for me. I can't say. I'm from this person who do not talk. Oh, you're going to do the job on you. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay. That is more dangerous than, you know, saying that I'm going to win 5-0. Yeah. Okay. And you know about the Gladkaya, right? Yes. What happened? Gladkaya told me, she wrote me very respectfully and very in a detailed way that for a short time, doctors suggested her
SPEAKER_00: to not to train. And she said, this, this was my dream. You know, I wanted to come East versus West and you finally invited me. And then like, I don't know what to do, but, and I said, don't worry about it. You know, this is health, you know, just forget it. And she was very thankful, but I didn't ask you about any detail because it's not my business. You understand? So Rosa, you know, Rosa,
SPEAKER_00: Rosa won the qualification event and also she took second to Barbara. She's happy. Yes, yes. And Fia said that Fia wants to pull. I said, Fia, are you sure? She said, yeah. She said, I'm worried and I'm going to pull her. You know, yeah. All right. Yeah. Yeah. And how do you see this match, Egle? I just fear a bit. What's that?
SPEAKER_00: I guess FIA will be favorite. You think 70 kilo FIA is going to beat her? Wow. I think, I think. If 70 kilo FIA beats the second place of WAF in the super heavyweight in 2022, then it will be very big prestige loss for the super heavyweight category. I keep fingers for FIA. Okay. Okay. And how do you see Sarah?
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I know too little about Rosa. But yeah, second place in the heavyweight. I mean, that's good. But yeah, I'm going to go with Fiat too.
SPEAKER_01: wow is it because you you support her or because you believe that she's gonna no i just like yeah for like 30 years like rosa i don't know her experience she's newer i think the i can pull this off with the skill endurance okay okay then let's go to frank lamparelli versus matt mask
SPEAKER_00: Cool match. It's good to see Frank back. I haven't seen much of him in years. Match was this year's Europeans, last year's Wolves. In last year's Wolves, he gave a tough match to Georgi Svetkov. Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah. Frank Lamparelli is a very, very dangerous top roller from his match here.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I explain about Frank Lamparelli because people may not know him as much as they know Matt Mask, but it is they are like built similar. Both are over 190 and both are top rollers. So how do you see this, Sara? Just based on like you said, he's been active recently, but I think Max will take this one just because he's so in it right now, like he's so hungry.
SPEAKER_01: and to like he's on fire like he really is like back in the game mentally and that aggression i think is gonna go in his favor and you i don't know maybe matt so you are thinking that matt has motion okay okay i understand and let's go to another one
SPEAKER_00: Rustam Babaev, Irakli Zirakashvili at 95 kilo. I think Irakli. Irakli? Yeah. You know, we have seen Irakli losing lately, but when he loses, he's losing his wrist. Against the hook pullers, he's not really losing, but Rustam, we don't see him losing his wrist either.
SPEAKER_00: And for me, it's a big question mark, but we will see. We will see. So you both think that Irakli has a better chance? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, but remember, this is 95 kilo. Irakli had been competing 105 kilo. So this is 95 middleweight category. Yeah. OK, let's go to another one. We have Artem Taino versus
SPEAKER_00: sasha under left arm world title match 95 kilo sasha sasha oh you ladies think sasha is gonna win okay i guess yeah last time they met final one left arm it was 2021 uh wars in romania and
SPEAKER_00: Their first meeting was tough. And in the finals, Hacho was trying to go strap and then kind of just pin him. He didn't allow him to go. This time, we will see. This time, yeah, it's a very tough match. But this is also another match that it can go either way. Rick Harrow. Hi, Engin. Thank you for hosting the best East versus West yet. Thank you very much, my friend. I thank you guys for the support. Without your support, I cannot do any of this. I can just go and have a...
SPEAKER_00: life of um how do you say the retirements you know anyway so let's go another one george swedco versus zaur by zulev georgie georgie i think yeah yeah of course we all just think who knows about the future yeah and sarah do you know zaur sarah
SPEAKER_00: yeah i i don't know him personally but uh he looks super strong like yeah so i'm gonna go with him so you are saying zara is gonna win and english saying georgie is gonna win okay okay let's go to another one um i saw
SPEAKER_00: How he trained, I think. Because the majority of the people are thinking that Ivan is going to win. Because Kamini, compared to Ivan, is less experienced. But he just won against Dave Chaffee. And he proved that he's in great shape. And you, Sara, how do you see that match? I think Ivan. Ivan is going to win?
SPEAKER_01: Can you explain like technically why you think? I don't know Ivan that well personally, but like when I think of him, I just put him in this super intelligent category. Like I don't know why, I just... Yeah, true, true, true. Yeah, he's like really... He can think while he arm wrestle, so like...
SPEAKER_00: and his past experience too like i i just think he yeah yeah we will see we will see that that's another interesting match and then let's go uh that that david samusha versus the the the old angry turk don't be nice don't be nice just like just because
SPEAKER_00: like we are friends or something no nice just say the way it is who's winning i always keep fingers of you so i thank you yeah you mean you mean you want me to win or you think i have i want that you win i want that you win but i see you prepare yeah you look good but you know the opponent as well right yes of course
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, he's incredible. He had five matches, he won all five matches, many times world champion, many times European champions, lotto champion, you know, just like an incredible athlete, you know, just like I don't see me looking favored on the paper. To me, it doesn't make sense, but is it possible? Anything is possible, but on the paper, I don't know. How do you see that, Sara?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so yeah, same. I think nobody has the mindset as you do. So like when you put your mind to something, you are the one to accomplish that. However, the only like downfall I see with you is that you're promoting this event and pulling it. It's hard to do both.
SPEAKER_01: so like however your mind is the day of if you're like stressed about everybody else i can see it go his way more than you but if we talk as an athlete physical preparedness i believe you yeah you remember last time you were here i was organizing competing for the bicep
SPEAKER_00: Yes. And I never thought you would do this again. So, but here we are. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, but just like, listen, like, like after like three decades of pulling the high level and then, and then just like, like what attracts you is the, like the, like impossible looking challenges, you know?
SPEAKER_00: So it is just part of me. Whenever I want one category, I want to do the other one. I never like to repeat myself. I kind of like whenever I repeat myself, I kind of feel like it is boring, you know, like no need to do that thing. You need to do something. That's the same mindset I have when I organize the East versus West. It needs to be something better. There needs to be something that's different, better, you know.
SPEAKER_00: maybe not every time but that is the goal you know that's the goal so now organizing and competing like if somebody's selling selling me it's impossible so i'm like oh he said impossible so let me do it understand that this is this is attractive you know yeah and and what do you guys think about peter galley on garber versus tatashins that that to me is another incredible incredible match
SPEAKER_00: i'm not buying fun so i'm from hungar bayou oh you're on the listen listen i kind of feel that you are not telling me the predictions but you're telling me who you are supporting you know that's how i feel like like like just because you want one person to win
SPEAKER_02: instead of you telling your opinion about how the match can go you are saying i support this guy like is it true or you are telling us who is going to win yes i am i just guessing but i am i am i am fun of anger so i look how he trained and i like he like i mean i like him like person
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Very, very, it's like saying like you, you know, like quiet, just does the job. Like, I never, never, ever heard him giving, like saying, I'm going to come and win. Like, I have been inviting him. We do the podcast, you know. It's just impossible, you know. Even you put a gun to his head, he's not going to say, I'm going to win. You know, he's just like, I did my best. Of course, I'm coming to win, but we will see. You know, this is how he goes, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: different yeah but it is impossible to not to admire the guy you know just like my personal opinion the guy is just like i was like losing my mind you know i don't know if you guys see what he brought directly here and he's like you know i don't know if you guys follow that one but um he did the explanation hit and then like in a lightning speed he also hit back you know the pronator
SPEAKER_00: he doing and he's doing everything in like this level and with the like light mean you know like speed you know like this you know just like incredible speed incredible endurance he can pull in any position the guy is just like like one level below prime jumbo zinc which had like incredible wrist dominance you know just my opinion just who cares about it what do you think sarah
SPEAKER_01: yeah like Todd and um um like they're both athletes that always surprise me or shock me like oh my God like they but in this one I really think on Garbaev will beat Todd yeah yeah the only thing is about the the only thing about art is that the guy
SPEAKER_00: can apply, roll the force power to the side way that the technique can become helpless. You cannot even engage, you know, what happened with John, what happened with Irakli, you know. And of course, he didn't work against Brudnick, who had, you know, like very strong copy to control the tornado Todd, you know.
SPEAKER_00: but whenever you don't have that wrist domination and then you just go like this way and leave his pronator and he has the pronator because you just pull his hand he doesn't care you take his hand he also pronate and then he beats you with that side pressure you cannot match it's almost impossible to match his side pressure so i don't know if ongarbe will be able to engage that one or not
SPEAKER_00: And John Brzee versus Sasho? I think Sasho. Sasho? Okay, one second. Sara, you said Sasho? Yeah? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You know, people, people underestimate Sasho and John is incredible. John has as much as chance that Sasho has, but people, especially in the strap, I will be surprised if John takes Sasho's risks. He may hang him there.
SPEAKER_00: this is okay he may be like this but take it like this i will be very surprised in in this trap but it doesn't mean that just because he cannot take his wrist he cannot beat him he can very well hang him on his
SPEAKER_00: and go straight sideways over his grenade. And I think that's the way to beat Sasho. But to underestimate Sasho is a big mistake. I still don't know. I need to ask Sasho, you know, if he wants to pull first Taino or John. But we will see. Why do you think Sasho is going to win, even though you saw his performance against Alexey Volyoda? Because...
SPEAKER_01: um okay so um voivoda had what 19 years off and came back for this one match i think it's hard to after that long to like you may think like i did this like i was gone for three to five years and then i faced gabby and i thought
SPEAKER_01: that, oh, I still got it, but no, like there's ways to go. Like I'm feeling now after four years of consistency, like if Vojvoda puts time back in, yeah, in a year or more, maybe he'll, you know, but the level always keeps getting better. So I think that was an awesome performance, but I don't think we can measure, you know,
SPEAKER_01: yeah also different style right alexi is mostly here and then when sasha is going in you know yeah and sasha to me is just this he every year waft you know just like a true athlete hungry to win um i i just think that will win yeah it's it's interesting yeah people compares with drop and sasha
SPEAKER_00: Sasha's wrist is like about not losing his wrist is better than Zurab's. Maybe Zurab have stronger bicep, but Sasha's application or the downside of his hand with the side pressure is more effective than Zurab's. Yeah. And how do you see that match Egle? John or Sasha? Sasha. Oh, Sasha as well?
SPEAKER_00: Interesting. Interesting. How do you ladies see like he hopes him and beats him or he tires him, you know, like long match and then he gas him out or like, how do you picture in your head? You know, I just guessing I haven't pictured. Okay. Okay. And yeah, no, I'm just asking, you know, like, like,
SPEAKER_00: that the way to do that you know john can go out and if john tries to go even more out the guy just never leaves here you know he puts pressure more and more and more so i'm just thinking that john may get tired you know of that pulling but if john doesn't try to get out but just uses his tornado as a block and then when
SPEAKER_00: sasha supines and gives already his pronator and then john controls there and goes over his pronator and i see that way john i don't think john can top roll him i don't think in hook john can beat him three times but in between outside and inside i think i see john has good chance of winning you know but i i don't have any prediction i see like 50 50. and then if you come to the main event
SPEAKER_00: Main event, probably one of the most important match in the history, if not the most important match in the history, because we have been talking about this match for like minimum 15 years and they pull once with left arm and then they said, oh, you didn't want to put me right arm. The other guy said, no, you didn't want to put me right arm. And, you know, finally they are about to meet again while
SPEAKER_00: Devon a few times challenged him before the agreed time and then Dennis didn't like this and because his fans said that oh Dennis is afraid of Devon while Dennis said that listen we agreed to do that in next fall you know so I made my plan that way
SPEAKER_00: And then they went, why are you doing this? You know, if you want me to pull earlier, you can, you know, my number, you can call me, we can talk, you know, why you do that publicly. And then people like attacks me. So Dennis calls him a clown after that. Uh, Dennis called him clown. And then Devon also repeated, uh,
SPEAKER_00: some also negative comments, you know, and then it looks like now calm, you know, but I don't know. How do you ladies see this match? Just imagine that, you know, Neil pick up with the microphone, ladies and gentlemen, you know, and then he announces them and then Devon comes, you know, he has, you know, classic. And then Dennis comes, it's big, big, just imagine, you know, just already my heart is just a little bit faster right now, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's start Clara. Devon got this. Devon got this? Do you expect a domination or just a war? I expect war, but I think Devon will win. Like this is it. Like this is it for Devon and I just know him personally enough to see
SPEAKER_00: and i know like how he trains and i know how like i i don't know it devon will win in my opinion then we'll win and then it may not be domination he will be a war but he will end up winning do you see any wrong dennis winning no no you don't see okay and egle
SPEAKER_00: I think Devon is smarter. I'm restless, so I think Devon. Do you think that when Dennis beat Devon, Dennis was smarter? That's why he won? Devon smarter. No, in 2018, when Dennis beat Devon, at that time, Dennis was smarter? Is that why he won? No, Dennis was stronger. Do you think it may be the same case this time, or just because Devon is smarter, he's going to win?
SPEAKER_00: Now everything changed, I think. Okay, yeah. So you are saying that Dennis is not the same Dennis and Devon is stronger than him? I think he's not the same Dennis. Yeah. I'm just guessing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I'm just trying to understand you, yeah. But Devon is also in probably the prime shape, you know, after that three and all that injury. Devon's had a lot of matches. He's, I think, more experienced for him. Yeah, yeah, I agree.
SPEAKER_00: Like people for many years, you know, called him like, you know, chicken, you know, you are not pulling the Eastern Europeans. And now we cannot stop him, you know, every two months he's been one of the Eastern Europeans, you know. And yeah, it will be, it will be an incredible event. And I just can't wait. And just like it's only beginning, you know, there will be one, hopefully, as long as we are breathing, we are training, there will be more and more and more events, you know.
SPEAKER_00: It will be incredible. I just can't wait. You two ladies, you know, title matches, full five rounds. Nice. I like that. Okay. Yeah. So no, no, no giving up. No giving up. Yeah. And, and, and Sarah, do you think that,
SPEAKER_00: Like, do you I don't know if you want to say this or not, but do you think that you should be or you are focusing more on endurance or explosiveness or a little bit of both? Oh, both. Like, yeah, it's so important to not just gas out completely in the first round because, you know, there's most likely going to be war.
SPEAKER_01: know five rounds you know you got to be you got to be prepared for everything like you said if at this level you need to have a lot of different you need to be well-rounded you need to be able to fight any style for a long time i think if you could go back in time when you pull against gabriella and then do i remember right that three rounds in a row you try to hook her
SPEAKER_00: I know. No, no, no. If you could just go back in time, would you do something different? Oh, yeah. I would. Start with the outside, right? Directly. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And did you expect, you know, what was the reason that you didn't go outside, but you just like one, two, three, like inside, you thought that your chance would be bigger?
SPEAKER_01: I, to be honest, I don't know. At the time, all I was thinking, this is it. And I had so many
SPEAKER_01: feelings inside me and I was like I cannot fuck this up like I need this is it this is my moment you know and I think I think my emotions overpowered me and I I felt strong inside obviously she was stronger but like leading up to that like I had trained so much inside um so you you made your plans based on cooking you you you're cooking her like you talk that okay the way to beat her is hook and you prepare that
SPEAKER_00: so that you just like expected it to work sooner or later yeah and like
SPEAKER_01: Honestly, like I have like, forgot so much to like, about that moment. It's like blacked out. Like, I don't remember because I was so that's why it's important to to like, stay active in the sport, you have to compete a lot. So you learn how to you how to control all these feelings. Because that's a skill to like, if you can't control what's in here, how are you going to control your body like you need to like,
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know that that's just as important so that's why i want to compete more now too so it's just as important as the physical did you did you think this way that like i made all my plans based on hook based on hook and then i trained uh hook but
SPEAKER_00: my top roll worked, you know, at least better than hook. And did you think that like, I wish I have trained only top roll and then start right from the round one top roll. You thought that, that way?
SPEAKER_01: yeah but I I had trained so much pronation and top roll too like so I had it it's just I did not think to apply that until round three or whatever it was and when I started feeling like oh my God there's an opening there's an opening you know I fouled out and then it was over so like yeah I mean I made a mistake you know and like I definitely it doesn't mean that you gave up about
SPEAKER_00: pulling against her right just because you lost two times it doesn't mean that you are not gonna try again the back side of your mind the back side of your mind there is there is still some plans yeah oh i'm not done until i'm done okay okay yeah i hate not i actually i hate i dislike the people who quiz you know i hate it because because there is one thing about me that i i dislike to quit and i don't so much
SPEAKER_00: really enjoy people who cook with you know and yep so yo looks like you know you both have something to do again against uh Gabriela and you Egle if you could go back in the time on that day do you think there could be anything to change or that day it was yes of course I know where I made a mistake where I could change a little bit something but I can't do nothing this day I can't do
SPEAKER_00: And then not even try to do something. So you are saying on that day you were not strong enough? Now I think I'm stronger. No, no, no. What I'm just saying, when you pull against Gabriela, even you knew what to do, it wasn't enough because you didn't have enough power at the time, probably. I think I made a mistake in technique a little bit. So if I could change,
SPEAKER_00: i don't know it will be different result or not i don't know i can't say now maybe in future we will see yeah okay okay so there is one more super chat and then we can um finish it
SPEAKER_00: Chris Drummond. Sorry if I pronounce your last name wrong. Sarah is going to beat Gabriela next time, I promise. People believe in you. By the way, you know, Gabriela is not there, but we talk a lot about her. I'm sure that also I observe. And, yeah, it will be great. I just can't wait. You know, just imagine, you know, all those. Afonina, what was her first name?
SPEAKER_00: Ekaterina? Ekaterina. Yeah, it was Ekaterina Larina, right? Larina Ekaterina. And then became Afonina, right? Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. And now, I don't know, she also got married, you know, the Bulgarian girl, Dimitrova. Is it still Dimitrova? Or changed now? Oh, I don't know. Yeah, she won the 60 kilo Europeans and awards.
SPEAKER_00: and yeah yeah and then um and there is one girl from japan she was just like big forearms you know just like she was five kilo yeah yeah yeah yeah that's awesome yeah she was also very strong now we have fear we have did you see that uzbek girl from uh uzbekistan the 70 kilo she won she won both youth category in the
SPEAKER_00: uh senor she was also very strong like many many people are coming you know and i just can't wait to invite all of them and uh nikita said that she will be training galatea will eventually be back you know it will be incredible yeah yeah maybe petrova i think last name right now is petro i think yeah yeah anyway so ladies thank you very very much it was an honor and it will be even

SPEAKER_00: And I lose another one. So this is for the world title. And in my opinion, this is the heaviest world title. Of course, the WAF is the amateur world title with the doping test and everything. Yeah. But in a professional level, there is no title right now. In my opinion, it's not because of my event. Heavier than this. And let's see who's going to put that belt on. Yep. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. You want that belt, Eylem? Of course. Of course. I want to win. I want to win.
